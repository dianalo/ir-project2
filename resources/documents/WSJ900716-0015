It was a fitting welcome to ameeting that had the air of a backwater cockfight.   As a pistol-packing guard hovered over the sparse crowdinside a dreary rented hall here, Joe Shoen's aging fatherjumped up and began berating him from the floor. Joe quicklytried to cut him off.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Wait a minute,&quot; a red-faced L.S. Shoen sputtered. &quot;Mr.Chairman, I am your father, I established this company, Ihave some points to make. I have never in the history of yourlife, in my relationship with you, ever prohibited you orstopped you from speaking your mind within a reasonablelimit. The fact is I have never stopped you.&quot;   But Leonard Samuel Shoen wishes he could.   In 1986, Joe Shoen, a burly lawyer with a Harvard MBA,ousted his father as chairman of Amerco, U-Haul's parentcompany, on the ground that the elder Mr. Shoen's mercurialstyle was ruining the Phoenix, Ariz., company. Ever since,the family patriarch has been fighting to reclaim his empire.In the course of the longrunning battle, the company thatonce dominated the lucrative business of renting out trailersand trucks has lost market share to aggressive competitorssuch as Ryder System Inc. and has wasted assets onmisbegotten diversification moves.   The vicious feud among the Shoens vividly illustrates theconflicts that can mangle family-run companies whengenerations collide. Rife with greed, it has divided L.S.Shoen's seven sons and five daughters into warring camps andmired Amerco in lawsuits, plots and purges.   The bitterness runs so deep that a March 1989shareholders' meeting erupted in a family brawl. Thepatriarch's lifetime employment contract, which amounted to apension, was terminated by son Joe, who, in turn, accuses hisfather of sicking the Internal Revenue Service on him. AndDr. Sam Shoen, who supports his father, contends that someonein Joe's group told Arizona medical licensing authoritiesthat he was a drunken psychopath.   This war of attrition has hurt the company and the familyin countless ways, not the least of which is money. Amercohas paid $5 million in legal fees so far, and Joe Shoencomplained, during one court hearing, that his attorney billsexceeded his gross income. &quot;It's as if I had a foot that hadgangrene,&quot; he said.   Behind such hostilities lies the almost Shakespeareantragedy of L.S. Shoen, a man too busy building his empire tounravel the malignant rivalries festering among the sons anddaughters who would one day inherit it. That failure nowhaunts him in the form of two rebellious sons, Joe and Mark.&quot;Their desire for absolute power is insatiable,&quot; Jerry Day, aTucson psychologist who has worked with the family, oncewrote of the two brothers. &quot;The more they have, the more theywant.&quot;   The empire in the middle of this firestorm is not theprofit machine it was in the 1960s, when U-Haul was aburgeoning company with no real competition. In recent years,management missteps and potent competitors have put itsearnings on a roller coaster. They hit $41.6 million in thefiscal year ended March 31, 1984, then plunged to a meager$2.2 million three years later, before bouncing back to $36.2million in fiscal 1989. Through the fiscal first nine monthsended last Dec. 31, the latest figure available, net incomefell again. It dropped 39% from a year earlier to $28.3million, even though revenue rose 1% to $737.6 million.Amerco blamed rising vehicle-replacement costs.   But with a fleet of 150,000 trucks and trailers and areal-estate portfolio worth an estimated $1 billion or more,Amerco remains an alluring prize. Now, its frustrated,74-year-old founder's only goal is to regain control longenough to sell it to an outsider and end the fighting. But inearlier years, he had a grand vision of U-Haul as the jewelof a business empire that would endure in his family forgenerations.   The son of an Oregon farmer ruined by the Depression, L.S.Shoen picked fruit, butchered cattle and barbered his waythrough three years of medical school before being expelledfor answering for a friend in class. Driven by deep-seatedfear of going broke, the young man friends called &quot;Slick&quot;boasted that he could pivot on a dime when he got an idea.   And he got a good one as a young World War II navalofficer trying to find a cheap way to haul his family'sbelongings from base to base. He built his first trailers onhis father-in-law's farm in Ridgefield, Wash. He startedU-Haul in 1945, with little capital and a cadre of formerblue-collar workers that he transformed into executives witha home-grown management philosophy that fused the teachingsof Napoleon and St. Francis of Assisi with corny credos suchas ExKH=R (energy times know-how equals results). At staffmeetings, L.S. might distribute Abraham Lincoln's letters ordeliver lengthy lectures on the &quot;Seven Environments ofOrganizations.&quot;   Obsessed with building his new company, L.S. Shoen lefthis wife and children for weeks at a time while he hit theroad with a toolbox under his car seat. Working 16-hour days,he recruited new dealers during the day, repaired trailers bystreetlight deep into the night and slept in his car. Toestablish bases in cities he couldn't visit, he rentedtrailers to anyone who promised to drop them off at a servicestation that looked like a potential U-Haul dealer. By themid-1950s, his dealer network stretched from Portland and LosAngeles to Miami and New York and accounted for 250,000rentals a year.   In his vision of the future, this empire was to be handedover to his 12 children, especially the boys. As teen-agers,some of his sons spent so much time painting U-Haul trailersthat they joked about having orange blood. Their fatherincreased their responsibilities as they grew older, evenbuying a Phoenix amusement park as a family managementproject.   Much to his later regret, Mr. Shoen also gave his childrenAmerco stock, so much of it that they eventually owned 95% ofthe company and he a mere 2%. While the gifts gave him taxbenefits, they gave his children control over U-Haul'sfuture.                                                                                                          The Problems Begin                                                                                                          Almost from the start, his dynastic dreams became tangledin a gnarl of personal problems. His wife of 13 years died ofheart failure in 1957, leaving him with six young children; ayear later, the 41-year-old widower married Suzanne Gilbert,the 23-year-old daughter of a neighbor.   That spawned years of trouble.   The older sons, Sam and Mike, were packed off to boardingschool, but Joe and Mark, the next in line, stayed home. Theybecame allies in a grinding war of wills with theirstepmother. &quot;Mark and Joe hated her guts in ways that wereunreal,&quot; recalls Mr. Shoen, who says they bombarded him withtales of his wife's supposed misdeeds every time he came homefrom a business trip.   By the time the Shoens and U-Haul moved to Phoenix fromPortland in 1967, the friction had escalated so much thatpolice were called to the family mansion one night followingan argument between Mark and his stepmother. &quot;He punched herout, and I mean hard,&quot; says the patriarch. In 1977, after 19years of marriage and five children, she got a divorce. (Histhird wife bore his 12th child.)   But the power struggle to come would not be between thegroups of Shoen children from different mothers. Instead, theprimary combatants would be the patriarch's four eldest sonsby his first wife.   In the mid-1970s, they began vaulting into the upper ranksof U-Haul management. Third son Joe, the president of U-HaulInternational, harbored ambitions of succeeding his father,but company executives knew that L.S. Shoen's choice waseldest son Sam, the head of East Coast field operations, who,at his father's request, had abandoned a promising medicalcareer to join the company.   In addition to wrestling with their own rivalries, thebrothers had to work side-by-side with their father, averitable whirlwind of contradiction and eccentricity. Helived in a mansion designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, yetinsisted on cheap motels and McDonald's hamburgers while onthe road. Though demanding that his executives think forthemselves -- he sometimes handed out $100 bills for goodideas -- he could explode in anger when things weren't doneto his liking. He once tossed $1,000 in cash from his officebalcony in front of stunned executives to dramatize his pointthat they were throwing away money on unnecessary expenses.   U-Haul dealers never knew when the founder, who pilotedhis own small plane, might suddenly appear on their lot andquiz employees or inspect equipment. New Orleans police wereastonished to learn that the apparent burglar they had nabbedscaling a dealership fence at 2 o'clock one morning wasU-Haul's millionaire founder, who wanted to inspect a damagedtruck he had spotted while driving by.                                                                                                          U-Haul's Fortunes Wane                                                                                                          Sam Shoen says brother Joe was already complaining abouttheir father's decision-making when they both joined thecompany in 1973. &quot;I'd walk home with him at night, and he'dsay, `The company is going bankrupt,'&quot; Sam recalls.   Though L.S. Shoen scoffed at the grumbling, U-Haul was introuble. Competitors had begun snaring U-Haul customers, andsoaring fuel prices caused the closing of hundreds offull-service gas stations that had been U-Haul dealers. Intypical freewheeling fashion, L.S. Shoen responded with abold diversification plan; ultimately, he opened a travelagency, a full-service moving company and a mobile-homerental service. He also started the first of nearly 1,100free-standing &quot;rental centers,&quot; stocking them with everythingfrom surfboards and baby chairs to champagne fountains andfolding dance floors.   But the founder's visions weren't always carefully thoughtout. In some cases, U-Haul dealers were asked to rent outitems they hadn't been trained to operate. Other itemsgathered by Mr. Shoen were simply unrentable, such as theAsian-made picnic tables that were too small for Americanadults. While the company borrowed heavily to finance theexpansion, Mr. Shoen lost customers by stubbornly refusing toreplace aging trucks and trailers.   &quot;They lost their focus and let their core business rundown,&quot; says Alex Gould, a transportation analyst at Moody'sInvestors Service.   As the business deteriorated, the recently divorcedpatriarch tumbled into a deep depression that eventually ledto a two-week stay at a Los Angeles hospital in 1978. Hereturned to find Mike grousing about harassment from Joe, andSam being accused of incompetence by Joe and Mark, who duringstaff meetings began badgering their father about hisdecisions.   Not even group counseling sessions with a psychologist anda family-business expert could bring peace. So L.S. Shoenshuffled his sons' assignments -- and created even moreresentment. Family members say an angry Mark took over WestCoast operations only after his father agreed not to visit orcommunicate with any U-Haul employee in the region.   Eventually, in 1979, Joe and Mark resigned. Still hopingto bring them back into the fold, L.S. continued to pay their$86,000 salaries for two more years and let Form BuildersInc., their new printing business, handle most of U-Haul'sbusiness forms.                                                                                                          Joe and Mark Strike                                                                                                          But Joe apparently had something else in mind. In a 1988deposition given in one of the family's many legalconfrontations in Arizona Superior Court, a longtime familyfriend, Darrell Hamby, testified about a sheet of legal paperthat he frequently saw on Joe's desk during the early 1980s.Although Joe has denied its existence, Mr. Hamby said herecalled its title being something like &quot;Getting Rid of theFounding Father.&quot;   By late 1984, L.S. Shoen had given Joe and Mark, whoretained their large stockholdings, plenty of ammunition todo just that. His refusal to replace U-Haul vehicles hadallowed Ryder to pull almost even in market share. WithU-Haul awash in high-interest debt, the expansion was halted,and U-Haul laid off 5,000 workers, cut management salaries10% and canceled the $200 employee Christmas bonus.   Armed with dire warnings about U-Haul's future andpromises of cash dividends on Amerco stock, Joe and Markenlisted enough family support to vote their father out asAmerco chairman at the October 1986 shareholders' meeting.The shaken founder -- who would later compare his betrayal tothat of Julius Caesar by the Roman Senate -- agreed toretire, provided that his warring sons met with aprofessional mediator to hammer out a compromise on futuremanagement. The result was a disastrous arrangement thatpaired Sam Shoen as Amerco president with archrival Joe aschairman of a four-member board that included youngerbrothers Jim and Paul, both his supporters.   Still hoping for peace, L.S. Shoen put the best face onthe coup at a retirement gala that the company dubbed the&quot;Celebration of Love and Respect.&quot; &quot;I do have enough sense toknow that I should stop, move aside and get out of the waywithout abandoning ship,&quot; he told the crowd. &quot;I do want youall to know that I trust my sons and daughters --absolutely.&quot;   Just two days later, Mr. Shoen recalls, &quot;I was on thephone with Joe, and he accused me of stealing hundreds ofmillions of his money by the way I had been running thecompany. He (was) very brutal about it.&quot;   Three months later, Sam Shoen quit as president amidcontinued bickering with Joe, who, according to Sam,frequently countermanded and criticized his decisions. In aletter, L.S. Shoen called Joe a &quot;con man&quot; and demanded hisresignation. &quot;Your lust for power and greed blind you,&quot; hewrote. &quot;I will not quit until you are out.&quot;   Amid the uproar, some of Joe's sibling backers began towaver, leaving him with less than a majority of assuredvotes. That set off a vigorous round of lobbying of familyshareholders. Joe delivered, for example, on his pledge todeclare the company's first dividends, including a$13.50-a-share whopper that gave family members a windfalltotaling $1.3 million. At the same time, he again canceledthe employees' Christmas bonus, explaining in a companynewsletter that &quot;I won't spend money we don't have on adiscretionary bonus.&quot;   Hostilities also increased. That summer, Sam Shoen says,the Arizona Board of Medical Examiners received an anonymouscomplaint, later dismissed, that accused him of being apsychopath, a drug addict and an alcoholic and of hinderinghis father from getting proper medical care. Sam himself, whowas still an Amerco director, began pressing the board toinvestigate the relationship between Amerco and FormBuilders, which continued to do much of U-Haul's printing.IRS investigators also began looking into Form Builders,focusing on its tax returns for the year ended June 30, 1984;Sam and his father deny sparking the investigation.   The printing company, which until fiscal 1984 had beenowned by conservatorships of Mark and Joe's three youngchildren, reported revenue of $2.4 million, all but about$7,000 of it involving U-Haul printing. Yet the company'sstock was sold that year to a longtime friend of Mark and Joefor just $33,000. But what really intrigued the IRS, andultimately led to a $470,000 judgment for back taxes againstForm Builders, was a $1 million deduction for payments to theShoen children's trusts. Form Builders had claimed them asbusiness expenses.                                                                                                          Kitchen-Table Scheme                                                                                                          By the last weekend in July 1988, Sam and his father hadwon over enough family members to gain control of 52% of thestock. But Joe outmaneuvered them with a scheme hatched, inpart, around his kitchen table. While Sam and company were inNew York talking to investment bankers about what to do withtheir stockholdings, Joe and his supporters on the boardpushed through an agreement to sell 8,099 shares of Amercotreasury stock to five loyal executives for about $22million, thereby shifting majority voting power back to Joe'sgroup. The executives didn't even have to come up with thecash: Joe lent them the $800,000 down payment, which heborrowed from the conservatorship accounts of his twochildren.   Finally in full control, Joe barreled fullbore into afive-year &quot;back-to-basics&quot; plan calling for replacement ofU-Haul's truck fleet at a cost of $1.5 billion, the sale ofunprofitable assets and the closure of many of theunprofitable subsidiaries launched by L.S. Shoen a decadeearlier. The new management conducted the overhaul with allthe grace of a midnight coup, trumpeting in one 1989 pressrelease that &quot;the chains of restraint that hobbled a stagnantpast management group were smashed.&quot;   Longtime executives with close ties to the founder weresuddenly asked, with little or no explanation, to turn incompany cars and credit cards. John Fowler, a regional vicepresident and a 33-year Amerco veteran, says he was sackedafter refusing to fire another executive.   The firings infuriated the ousted founder. &quot;These peopledepended on me,&quot; says Mr. Shoen, who vented his rage in abarrage of Arizona Superior Court lawsuits. One asked thecourt to reverse the Amerco stock sale, on the ground that itwas merely a scam to gain control of the company. Three moresuits sought to have Joe and Mark removed as the conservatorsof their children's trusts. In yet another action, joined bysons Sam and Mike, L.S. Shoen accused Mark and Joe ofovercharging Amerco for Form Builders' services.   Headlines about the feud unnerved Wall Streetcredit-rating services enough that they issued a low initialrating on, and effectively killed, a proposed $100 millionAmerco preferred stock offering. Amerco subsequently hit SamShoen with a $750 million suit in the Arizona court accusinghim of trying to sabotage the company by giving confidentialinformation to outsiders and slandering it to the press. Joeand Mark personally filed another suit in the same courtagainst their father, brothers Sam and Mike and theirattorney, Marvin Johnson of Phoenix, and asked the court toenjoin them from continuing their &quot;war of harassment.&quot;   A way out of the tangled web was provided by JeromeKohlberg, the leveraged buy-out expert, who in early 1989made an offer to L.S. Shoen to purchase Amerco for $875million in cash and securities. But Joe rejected the bidafter meeting with the former Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.partner on a yacht off Florida.                                                                                                          Bruising Confrontation                                                                                                          That March, a scuffle broke out after the Amercoshareholders' meeting in Reno, Nev., over attempts by formerU-Haul law director Mike Shoen, who supports his father, totape-record the session. Afterwards, Mike posed shirtless fora photographer to display bruises that he asserted had beeninflicted by his brother Mark, now president of U-HaulInternational. In a subsequent interview with the ArizonaRepublic, Joe Shoen -- who scheduled the next shareholders'meeting for remote Tonopah, Nev. -- denied that anyone hadbeen beaten up. &quot;After the meeting, people acted as humanbeings,&quot; he said mysteriously.   Through a spokesman, Joe Shoen and his supporters declinedto discuss the Shoen family or Amerco for this article. HarryDeShong, executive vice president of marketing and recipientof some of the treasury stock issued in the battle forcontrol, says: &quot;I don't want to substantiate or corroborateanything related to the story you are writing.&quot;   Although every lawsuit filed against Joe Shoen's group andthe company has been dismissed on the merits, L.S. Shoen andhis supporters have appealed each decision. Meanwhile, thestruggle goes on. L.S. Shoen adopted a favorite nephew in amove that could effectively increase his influence over sometrust-held Amerco stock. Amerco reduced the damages sought inits suit against Sam Shoen from $750 million to $30 millionbut added as defendants L.S. Shoen, sister Mary AnnaShoen-Eaton, brother Mike Shoen and all of their spouses.That suit is scheduled for trial Sept. 10.   Some U-Haul executives and family friends doubt that therewill ever be peace in the house of Shoen. As one former vicepresident puts it: &quot;There's no Shoen who will ever run thatcompany without the other Shoens making his life miserable.&quot;   In a long letter to all of his children last year, L.S.Shoen admitted as much. He lamented the &quot;tragedy whichultimately may devastate our lives and the lives of ourchildren and grandchildren.&quot; Cut off from his company andhalf his family, he spends much of his time pounding out longletters to lawyers and friends, pouring over Amerco resultsand cursing the day he first dreamed of a family dynasty.   &quot;No man should give away his wealth or power until hedies,&quot; the battered empire builder says. &quot;No way. No way.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
