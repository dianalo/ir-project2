The Jan. 2 collapse of the 4 million-gallon storage tank nearPittsburgh spewed more than 700,000 gallons of diesel fuel into theMonongahela and Ohio rivers in one of the worst inland oil spillsin U.S. history.   Some 23,000 suburban Pittsburgh residents were without tap waterfor a week, and cities all along the two rivers had water suppliescontaminated until the oil slick was finally diluted.   The Labor Department's Occupational Health and SafetyAdministration accused Ashland of willful violations in failing toproperly weld steel plates that formed the tank wall and failing torepair defective welds after they were discovered. OSHA proposed a$30,000 penalty on those points.   OSHA also claimed a serious safety violation, with a proposedpenalty of $1,000, because the dike surrounding the tank wasinadequate to contain the oil, said Garry Griess, OSHA areadirector in Pittsburgh.   The agency is seeking an $800 penalty because Ashland failed toestablish a plan for responding to such an emergency and failed tohave a written safety plan for the Floreffe Terminal.   Ashland officials are reviewing the citations and weighing theiroptions, which include formally contesting the civil charges, saidcompany spokesman Roger Schrum.   OSHA spokesman Al Belsky in Philadelphia said Thursday thatAshland had not yet contested the citations.   The company did contest citations issued Jan. 28 totaling$18,000 concerning alleged violations during the river cleanup.</TEXT></DOC>
