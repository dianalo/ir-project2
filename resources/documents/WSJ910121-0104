Technology stocks arehot again.   Investors last week rushed to the shares ofcomputer-related companies as one after another reportedsurprisingly robust earnings. First, Digital Equipment, thenBorland International, International Business Machines, AppleComputer and Microsoft turned heads with unexpectedly strongquarterly profits.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;People are flocking back. There's a lot of good news,&quot;says Lawrence Bowman, who was last year's top-performingtechnology fund manager with an 18% gain in the FidelitySelect Computer Fund of Boston.   Notoriously volatile, technology shares burned as manyinvestors last year as they rewarded. Technology mutual fundsfell on average more than 3%. But strategists, analysts andlarge investors now suggest that as the nation's economystruggles to get back on its feet, shares of companies withfast-selling, proprietary technology may be a sound bet.   Investors who take the leap into technology stocks should&quot;focus on companies with strong product cycles that don'trequire a vigorous economic recovery to do well themselves,&quot;says Abbey Joseph Cohen, investment strategist for Goldman,Sachs andamp; Co.   &quot;In a bad economy, a favorable product cycle can be mannafrom heaven,&quot; agrees Roger McNamee, portfolio manager of T.Rowe Price Associates' Science andamp; Technology Fund.   The success of Microsoft's Windows 3.0 software -- anupgraded version of Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system thatruns millions of personal computers -- is a prime example ofhow a hot product that dominates a market can propel acompany forward even in rough times. After the market closedFriday, the Redmond, Wash., software company reported thatfourth-quarter net income soared more than 44% to 91 cents ashare on revenue of $460.5 million, matching analysts'highest expectations. Microsoft's stock reached a 52-weekhigh Thursday of 86 1/4 in the over-the-counter market,nearly double its low for the year.   Technology veterans warn that the path to success will bebumpy for many companies -- and their shareholders. &quot;You'llnever take all the volatility out of the growth path of anemerging company,&quot; says Gordon S. Macklin, chairman ofHambrecht andamp; Quist of San Francisco, which specializes ininvestment banking for technology companies.   The zeal inherent in entrepreneurs can sometimes be theirdownfall, asserts Mr. Macklin. &quot;They sometimes plan unrealexpectations through their own enthusiasm,&quot; he says. Ifcompanies don't inform shareholders of both the ups and downsof their progress, &quot;you can have torpedoes (in stocks) thesame day you have tremendous successes,&quot; he says.   &quot;The byword in technology investing is selectivity,&quot; Mr.Macklin cautions.   &quot;The surest way to underperform the market is to have aperfectly diversified portfolio of tech stocks,&quot; agrees Mr.McNamee.   Some of the biggest names in technology -- which have someof the easiest stocks to trade -- have hot new products thatpromise to boost revenue. Apple's new, low-cost personalcomputer is a winner.   Compaq Computer, traded on the New York Stock Exchange,can't keep up with demand for its new laptop computers. SunMicrosystems is selling a new workstation. IBM is expected toship a new line of mainframe computers later this year.   &quot;We've had a 2 1/2-to-three-year period where it was hardto put big money to work in technology and catch a productcycle,&quot; says Mr. McNamee. This year's prospects for the bigcompanies are luring investors back and &quot;creating a haloeffect&quot; for the rest of the group, he says.   Some of the most popular names are getting pricey, butothers are still cheap, says Kenneth Kneutel, manager of theKemper Technology Fund of Chicago. Microsoft, for example, isselling at more than 26 times estimated 1991 earnings ofabout $3.23 a share; that's &quot;fairly valued&quot; by Mr. Kneutel'scriteria. Two brokerage firms last week turned cautioustoward Apple in large part because the company's sharesalready have had a big run-up.   Semiconductor maker Intel, meanwhile, is selling at about12 times estimated profit, below the multiple for the broadermarket, and appeals to Mr. Kneutel.   The multiples at which growth stocks trade typicallyexpand as interest rates fall, adds Mr. Kneutel. That patternmakes selected technology stocks particulary attractive amidsigns that the inflation rate may fall and the FederalReserve Board may ease credit further. He adds, however, thatno one expects to return to the heady days of the early 1970sand early 1980s, when growth and technology stocks traded attwice the market multiple.   Technology stocks could stumble for several reasons,caution Mr. Kneutel and Fidelity's Mr. Bowman. Poorerearnings often come in at the end of the reporting period; afew disappointments this quarter could torpedo some stocks.The March earnings period may be particularly anemic becausebusiness in January, which typically is slow, was furtherinterrupted by the war with Iraq.   Looming concerns about the strength of the banking systemand the economy could also stonewall the group's rise. &quot;Ifconfidence collapses within a month after the invasion ofIraq, then I'd move right back to a defensive posture&quot; instocks, says Mr. Kneutel.   In the meantime, smart money managers and analysts saysome of the best values may come from stocks that haven'tbeen widely discovered by the growing crowd of technologyfans. Some of their picks include:                                                                                                          Vitalink Communications: This Fremont, Calif., maker ofdata communications products has $7 a share in cash and isdue to come out with a new product later this year, says Mr.Bowman. At Friday's close of 9 1/8, he calls the stock abargain.                                                                                                          Methode Electronics: Based in Harwood Heights, Ill.,Methode makes electronic parts for air bags. Its Class Bshares have long been a favorite of Mr. Bowman's.                                                                                                          Hutchinson Technology: A maker of assembly parts for diskdrives, this Hutchinson, Minn., company is now bettersituated in the disk drive business and is diversifying intomedical technology, says Daniel Leonard, manager of theFinancial Strategic Portfolio Technology Fund of Denver. AtFriday's close of 10 1/8, it's one of his picks.                                                                                                          Mentor Graphics: Based in Beaverton, Ore., Mentor hadtroubles completing a new generation of computer-aidedengineering software, but is about to enter a period of newgrowth, says Mr. Kneutel.                                                                                                          BMC Software: This Sugarland, Texas, maker of software formainframe computers was added last month to Goldman Sachs'slist of stocks recommended for purchase by technology analystRick Sherlund. He says the weak economy hasn't stalled BMC'sstrong earnings growth.                                                                                                          Phoenix Technologies: After a &quot;very unpleasant transition&quot;to a new software system, this Norwood, Mass., company is nowwell-positioned to post some strong earnings from its nicheproduct, says Mr. McNamee of T. Rowe Price.                                                                                                          Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          OTC stocks extended their gains as oil prices fell.   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.18 to 376.99, or 0.3%,as National Market System volume slowed to 113 million sharesfrom 176.8 million Thursday. Declining stocks led advancers,936 to 773. Apple Computer slipped 1 to 50 1/4. Analysts atMerrill Lynch and Shearson Lehman Brothers turned cautioustoward shares of the Cupertino, Calif., computer maker, whichThursday reached a 52-week high of 51 1/4 and have more thandoubled since mid-October.   Chandler Insurance tumbled 2 3/4 to 4. The reinsurer,which is based in the Grand Cayman Islands, said lateThursday that it expects that additions to its loss reserveswill result in a &quot;sizable&quot; fourth-quarter loss and possibly aloss for the full year. In 1989, Chandler had net income of50 cents a share for the fourth quarter and $1.98 for theyear.   Octel Communications rose 2 to 14 3/8. The Milpitas,Calif., maker of voice processing systems reported lateThursday that net income for the second quarter, ended Dec.31, eased to 23 cents a share from 26 cents a year earlier.The earnings, however, exceeded analysts' expectations, andprompted Merrill Lynch analyst Joseph Bellace to upgrade hisshort-term opinion on the stock to &quot;above average&quot; from&quot;neutral,&quot; Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said.   DSC Communications climbed 1/4 to 5 7/8. The Plano, Texas,maker of digital telephone switching systems said that itplans to offer &quot;a broad array of advanced intelligent networktelecommunications products&quot; instead of focusing exclusivelyon switching equipment for the cellular telephone industry.DSC also said that it reached an agreement with Motorola todevelop open cellular system interface standards for theworld-wide market.   Separately, Global America Inc., a small New Yorkbrokerage firm owned by Michael Markowski, closed itssecurities business last week, according to the NationalAssociation of Securities Dealers, the self-regulatory bodyfor OTC stocks.   The firm voluntarily closed its investment banking andbroker-dealer business after its net capital fell below therequired minimum of $25,000, said John Pinto, NASD executivevice president, compliance. Global made a market in about 23stocks traded on the Nasdaq automated quote system.   Global America's customer accounts were cleared throughPrudential-Bache Securities Inc., which means that thedelivery of customers' stocks continues to be backed by thefinancial soundness of that brokerage firm, Mr. Pinto said.   It's understood that Prudential-Bache approached D.H.Blair andamp; Co. early last week to ask whether the investmentfirm would be interested in taking over Global or some of itsbusiness. A Blair executive said: &quot;We did investigate that,and had been working with Prudential-Bache and with thevarious regulatory bodies to see if it would make sense&quot; butconcluded Friday that it &quot;wasn't viable to proceed with sucha plan.&quot;   Global America officials couldn't be reached for comment.   Friday, three companies based in Long Beach, Calif. -- HQOffice Supplies Warehouse Inc., A.G. Automotive WarehousesInc. and Auto Depot Inc. -- blamed recent declines in theirstock prices on Global America's demise. The firm had beenthe investment banker and primary market maker for the threecompanies. Several other firms continue to make markets intheir shares.
