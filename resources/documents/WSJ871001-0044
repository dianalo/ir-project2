U.S. District Court Judge Vincent L. Broderick noted that if guidelines proposed by the U.S. Sentencing Commission were in effect, he would have had to sentence Mr. McDermott 18 months to 24 months in prison. Many federal judges have criticized the guidelines, which will take effect Nov. 1 unless delayed by Congress.    The kickback scheme, in which Mr. McDermott admitted receiving $212,750 in illegal payments while at the bank and bribing a Morgan officer after he left, was disclosed by prosecutors in June. At that time, Mr. McDermott pleaded guilty to two criminal counts. The bank identified the other Morgan officer as Antonio Gebauer, a former senior vice president, who was convicted earlier on separate bank-fraud and tax-evasion charges.    For his part, Mr. McDermott was shielded from possible tax charges in his plea agreement with U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani.    Judge Broderick also ordered Mr. McDermott to serve five years probation and to perform 600 hours of community service over a three-year period.    Morgan Guaranty, a unit of J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., was &quot;unaware&quot; of the illegal payments, the government said.    The judge said Mr. McDermott's attorney, Jed S. Rakoff, had convinced him that the sentencing guidelines weren't an issue and shouldn't be considered. But he said it was &quot;significant&quot; that under the guidelines white-collar crimes &quot;are going to be dealt with much more severely.&quot;    Mr. McDermott, a 17-year Morgan employee who became an outside consultant in 1982, received his kickbacks while at the bank mostly through fees paid by Morgan to another unidentified consultant -- and then to Mr. Gebauer.    The fees were paid in connection with work Morgan did for two corporate clients. They were identified yesterday for the first time as Engenheiros Especializados S.A., or Engesa, a Brazilian arms maker; and Hills Brothers Coffee Inc., now a unit of Nestle S.A. The companies weren't accused of wrongdoing. </TEXT></DOC>
