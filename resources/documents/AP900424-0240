Milken, 43, broke down and sobbed before the packed Manhattancourtroom as he finished a lengthy statement outlining his crimes,which included illegal trading with stock speculator Ivan Boeskyand others from 1984-86.   ``I realize by my acts I have hurt those who are closest to me.I am truly sorry,'' Milken said. He had to be supported by hisattorney and his voice cracked when he pleaded, ``Guilty, yourhonor.''   Milken faces a maximum 28 years in prison at his scheduled Oct.1 sentencing before U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood, although legalexperts expect a term of around five years.   The plea marked a stunning victory in the government's crackdownon Wall Street crime that has included more than 30 convictions andtargeted Milken and his former employer, Drexel Burnham LambertInc., from its outset in 1986.   Milken widely is regarded as the most important Americanfinancier since J.P. Morgan Jr. in the early 1900s and he came tosymbolize the bounty and excesses of a booming Wall Street. Hispersonal fortune is said to exceed $1 billion.   Milken pioneered the use of high-yield debt securities known asjunk bonds that gave small companies access to billions of dollarsin capital and also made possible the wave of hostile corporatetakeovers that characterized the dog-eat-dog 1980s.   But his downfall began after he was linked to an insider tradingnetwork by Boesky, who received a three-year prison term and wasfined $100 million in November 1986 to settle his own case.   Milken was indicted on 98 counts of fraud and racketeering inMarch 1989, but vigorously maintained his innocence. He reversedcourse last week and agreed to the plea bargain, avoiding a long,costly trial and the prospect of a much stiffer prison term.   Richard Breeden, chairman of the Securities and ExchangeCommission, said in Washington that Milken's admissions``demonstrate that he stood at the center of a network ofmanipulation, fraud and deceit.''   Milken pleaded guilty to conspiracy, securities fraud, mailfraud, helping others violate federal securities regulations andassisting in the filing of a false tax return.   Far less severe than the original indictment, the counts do notinvolve rackteering or unlawful securities trading based on insideinformation. The racketeering charge carried a minimum 20-yearprison term and possible forfeiture of Milken's wealth.   ``The charges are a far cry from the lurid, irresponsible andprejudicial accusations against Michael that have been made byanonymous sources to the press for the past 3{ years,'' Milkenattorney Arthur Liman said after the plea.   ``It is Michael's hope that ... history will see his violationsin context and judge him not just on the basis of his lapses but onthe basis of the contributions that he made to the economy and tothe American people,'' he said.   Under the settlement, Milken agreed to pay $200 million in finesto the Justice Department and to $400 million for a civil fund forreimbursing investors defrauded by his actions. The penalties arethe largest against an individual in U.S. history.   The government dropped all charges against Milken's brother,Lowell, who was named in the indictment. The status of formerDrexel trader Bruce Newberg, also part of the original case, wasnot yet resolved.   Milken also is required to cooperate with the government afterhis sentencing. The deal settles civil SEC charges and bars Milkenpermanently from the securities industry.   ``We believe that this prosecution and the fact that Mr. Milkenhas admitted to guilt will send the right message to the financialcommunity,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney John K. Carroll told the court.   Carroll said that after sentencing is completed, the public``should conclude that justice has been done.''   Milken, wearing a blue suit, white shirt and blue polka-dot tie,was composed as he described the work of Drexel's Beverly Hills,Calif.-based junk bond department and his unlawful actions. Hebroke down in discussing his personal struggle during the four-yearinvestigation.   In addition to conspiracy, Milken admitted to:   _Violating federal disclosure requirements by failing to recorda deal compensating Boesky for trading losses in Fischbach Corp. in1984. Boesky had acquired more than 10 percent of the takeovertarget on Milken's recommendation and Milken promised to to coverany trading losses.   _Securities fraud involving the sale of MCA Inc. stock by Drexelclient Golden Nugget Inc. in the fall of 1984. Milken said hearranged illegal trades to cover losses by Boesky, who agreed tobuy blocks of MCA stock to mask sales of large positions and createthe appearance of market demand.   _Violating federal net capital standards by forcing Drexel tobuy more than 1 million shares in Helmerich andamp; Payne Corp. in early1985 from Boesky's firm, which agreed to buy back the stock at alater date. The transactions were not recorded on the books ofBoesky's Seemala Corp.   Milken said he was not involved in buying the stock but learnedof it later and approved the deal.   _Illegal securities trading with Drexel client David Solomon,head of Solomon Asset Management, to recoup some commissions paidby Drexel to a fund managed by Solomon in 1985 and 1986.   _Creating short-term capital losses through a series of bondtransactions in American Adventure Inc. and Patient Technology Inc.to benefit Solomon's personal income tax liability.   Milken said his plea was an admission of personal responsibility``and not a reflection of the underlying soundness and integrity ofthe capital markets in which we specialized.''   ``Our business was in no way dependent on these practices,'' hesaid. ``Nor did they comprise a fundamental part of our businessand I regret them very much.''   Junk bonds grew from an obscure form of debt to a $200 billionmarket almost entirely because of Milken, who controlled a widenetwork of buyers and sellers and wielded enormous power.   The market virtually dried up last fall because of problemsinvolving several large defaults and Milken's departure from thescene.   Drexel settled related civil and criminal charges last year bypleading guilty to six felonies and agreeing to pay $650 million infines and restitution. Milken quit Drexel last June after 19 yearsto form his own consulting firm.   Drexel itself collapsed and has been liquidating since itsparent company defaulted on debt payments and filed for bankruptcycourt protection in February.</TEXT></DOC>
