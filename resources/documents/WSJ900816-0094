Mr. Kohl privately told Italian leader Giulio Andreotti bytelephone that he would be willing to send five West Germanminesweepers to the Persian Gulf, but only as part of aninternational fleet that would be approved at next Tuesday'smeeting of the West European Union.</LP><TEXT>   The Bonn government has already dispatched the ships tothe eastern Mediterranean, replacing North Atlantic TreatyOrganization ships sent to the gulf in response to Iraq'sinvasion of Kuwait.   But Mr. Kohl's apparent willingness to go even furtherunderlines Germany's readiness to play a more active worldrole, a readiness that is likely to increase after East andWest Germany's scheduled unification late this year.   &quot;We are the largest country in Western Europe, and webelieve we have to join the common solidarity of the Westernworld&quot; regarding Iraq, says Horst Teltschik, Mr. Kohl'snational security adviser.   Mr. Teltschik wouldn't comment on what he called the&quot;theoretical possibilities&quot; of sending the minesweepers intothe gulf, an act that would be expected to encounterpolitical opposition as well as constitutional impediments tothe use of German troops outside the territory of NATO. Buthe said, &quot;We have to prove the possibilities of what we cando more than ever before because of the expectations of theinternational community.&quot;   A year ago, Bonn would have faced a storm of internalopposition for actions it has already taken: allowing theU.S. to deploy forces to the gulf from German bases,deploying its own ships and joining the sanctions imposed onIraq after its Aug. 2 invasion. But sending forces to apotential war zone is a far more sensitive matter in Germany,and Mr. Kohl might not be able to pull it off.   His own foreign minister, Hans Dietrich Genscher, says hebelieves the country's constitution forbids it. Theopposition Social Democratic Party's contingent in theBundestag is likely next week to oppose any such deploymentbut at the same time suggest a change in the constitutionthat would allow German troops to be used outside NATO'sterritory as part of a United Nations contingent.   No matter what becomes of the minesweepers, however, thedecision marks the growing pains of a new political power.The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe turn to West Germanyfirst for economic assistance, the U.S. leans on it to rallyEuropean support for Washington's actions, and Germany itselfis increasingly unmatched in political and economic power inEurope.   Most of all, Germany's attitude has changed. After yearsof being psychologically and politically handicapped by itsmilitaristic past and the resulting postwar division of thenation, it has become more willing to stand up for itsnational goals.   &quot;Germany is going to be a more prickly country when shedefends her interests,&quot; says Thomas Kielinger, editor of theWest German weekly Rheinischer Merkur. &quot;We will be less meek,less like a lamb, more assertive -- not domineering, but in anatural sense.&quot;   But where Germany's increased influence can be bestmeasured isn't in the gulf but in Eastern Europe, where itsformerly Communist neighbors are all seeking help. Here, Bonnis held back only by its unfamiliarity with its new role andby fiscal limitations imposed by the cost of absorbing EastGermany.   &quot;The role that Germany is playing in the world has a newquality,&quot; Mr. Teltschik says. &quot;The problem is that mostGermans haven't recognized it yet. We must take moreresponsibility ourselves. The world expects more of us.However, we are of the opinion that the expectations are toogreat. World-wide, people expect we can finance everything.We just don't have the economic and financial resources tomeet those expectations.&quot;   That said, Germany has seldom been so well positionedeconomically. In the first quarter alone, it was able toexpand its exports by 18% to nearly $100 billion and surpassthe U.S. as the world's largest exporter. After unification,which will ultimately expand the country's potential by 25%,experts say the country could hold onto that position foryears. West Germany's trade surplus in the first quarter wasnearly double that of Japan's at $22 billion.   Some officials say Mr. Kohl is using his minesweepers lessto flex muscle and more to pay a debt to President Bush forhis support of German unification. &quot;There isn't a politicaldebt, but a moral and political obligation,&quot; Mr. Teltschiksays. &quot;The Americans have shown strong solidarity for theGermans not just during the last year, but over the last 40years. Now we can't say it doesn't matter.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
