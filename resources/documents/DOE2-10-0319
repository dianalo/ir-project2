This paper describesa modification of the standard purification sequence by adding recrystallizationof the mercuric iodide in hydrochloric acid. Leaching cation impuritiesout of mercuric iodide powder with hydrochloric acid has been practicedbefore by Zaletin, [V.M. Zaletin, I.H. Nozhiua, I.N. Fomin, V.T. Shystov,and N.V. Protasov, Atomic Energy 48, 169 (1980)]. Our objective for thehydrochloric acid treatment was to remove nitrates and hydrocarbons whichwere interfering with the vapor transport during crystal growth. Resultsof the procedure are presented in terms of total carbon and selectedion content of the treated and untreated material. 13 refs., 8 figs.,3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
