Lenders last week were asking, on average, a 10.58% rate on 30-year, conventional fixed-rate mortgages, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. The rate was unchanged from a week earlier, but above the 10.32% rate of a month earlier. A year ago, fixed-mortgage rates averaged 10.70%.    Meanwhile, initial rates for conventional adjustable loans with rates tied to one-year Treasury notes averaged 7.90% last week, according to the Freddie Mac survey. That was up from the 7.77% average rate of a week earlier, and above the 7.63% rate of the previous month. A year ago, the average initial rate being offered on such mortgages was 7.97%. Conventional mortgages aren't insured by the government.    Analysts attributed last week's unusually sharp increase in adjustable mortgage rates to recent credit tightening moves by the Federal Reserve and to decisions by many housing lenders to stop steep discounting of initial adjustable mortgage rates.    &quot;In the past, the initial rate (for adjustable mortgages) was artificially low,&quot; said Martin Regalia, chief economist of the National Council of Savings Institutions, a thrift industry trade group. &quot;I don't think there's as much discounting now, and as a result the rate is more closely tied to the corresponding market rate -- and that rate has been creeping up in recent weeks.&quot;    Mark Obrinksy, an economist with the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, agreed. He added that thrifts, which dominate the adjustable-rate mortgage market, have increased their share of the overall mortgage market and thus are under less competitive pressure to offer discounts.    Moreover, the spread between fixed-mortgage rates and rates on adjustable loans is wide enough to make adjustable mortgages an attractive alternative even without sharply discounted initial rates, he said.    Analysts said they expected mortgage rates to continue their upward climb through the end of the year, with fixed rates reaching as high as 11.5%.    A separate survey in early May by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board underscored the trends. The Bank Board said adjustable-rate mortgages represented 53% of the loans closed in early May, up from 49% in early April. That was the first increase in their share of the market in five months. The Bank Board attributed the increase to a widening that month in the spread between fixed-rate and adjustable loans.    According to the Bank Board, the average effective rate for conventional fixed-rate mortgages rose to 10.63% in early May, up from 10.48% in early April. The average effective initial interest rate for the most common type of adjustable mortgages -- those that restrict rate increases -- was 8.68%, up from 8.61% in early April.    The Bank Board also reported that the average purchase price of a new home in early May was $141,100, down from the record $151,400 reported in early April. </TEXT></DOC>
