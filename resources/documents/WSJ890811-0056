Then he discovered what big spenders really need.    Today, the Marders Nurseries Inc. summer team of 80 will plant 60-year old Japanese maple trees in your front yard. No matter how new your fortune, at least your trees will look old-money. The company also relocates entire driveways to give more scenic access to mansions. Average project cost: $50,000.    &quot;We give a look like a generation before them lived here,&quot; says Mr. Marder. &quot;That's worth money.&quot; In the past three years alone, the company has doubled its profits and tripled its staff, he adds. Sales are still &quot;under $20 million&quot; a year, he says, but they're headed up.    As in many pricey playgrounds from Palm Beach, Fla., to Palm Springs, Calif., small businesses here are profiting handsomely from growing throngs of affluent Americans who demand every conceivable luxury and service in their vacation retreats. And as business owners tell it, more people than ever will gladly pay whatever it takes to get the pampering they want.    Nowhere is the trend more visible than in East Hampton, one of the most chic and expensive vacation havens in America. With August the hottest month for vacationing here, many business owners say they're ringing up more sales right now than ever before.    Over the years, the streets have become choked with more New York City denizens flocking here by jet, Jaguar and jitney. This summer, officials estimate the population at between 60,000 and 80,000, compared with about 17,000 in winter. Vacationers come for the rolling pastures and pristine beaches, and they shop with a vengeance.    Many shopkeepers fret over how long they can keep this gold mine to themselves. Already a few big-name retailers, including Ralph Lauren, have set up shop. And as more vacationers keep coming, locals complain that the crowds erode the very charm they came to enjoy.    But for now, they will put up with the profits.    With business booming on a recent Saturday morning, the parking lot behind the Barefoot Contessa gourmet food store looks like a Mercedes dealership. Inside, shoppers squeeze through the cramped aisles, designer bags bulge with gourmet foods, and cashiers ring up goat cheese at $17.50 a pound.    As shoppers peel off bills and charge triple-digit orders with American Express Gold cards, owner Ina Garten shakes her head and smiles. &quot;We can't make enough,&quot; says Mrs. Garten, whose volume has tripled since she bought the store in 1985. &quot;Every Sunday we beat the last Sunday. This is a very profitable business.&quot;    And there's plenty of room for competitors. Down the road, another gourmet food store gets $42 a pound for lobster salad.    At East Hampton Classic Auto Services Inc., seven mechanics -- triple the number four years ago -- work overtime to repair Porsches, Fiats and Jaguars lined up outside the garage. The shop charges up to $500 to tune up a Porsche; any other engine work will cost you $58 an hour. There is a waiting list.    &quot;We have a reputation for being expensive, but good,&quot; says owner Robert Kennedy, whose profits have steadily increased over the years. &quot;Seventy-five percent don't even ask for an estimate.&quot;    Mr. Kennedy says the &quot;slow season&quot; is getting shorter; recently, business has been good through December.    Vacationers here are happy to pay big money even for the most mundane service. Hawkeye Home Management says it gets $20 an hour for cleaning houses -- and is turning away business. &quot;There's a lot of money to be made out here for honest, legitimate companies,&quot; says Dick Rodriguez, owner. People &quot;don't ask how much it costs.&quot;    For the most part, brokers, bankers and media types who can't afford mansions out here buy summer shares in houses. Often strangers thrown together for the weekend, they will spend all of Saturday preparing for dinner, if not shopping. Odds are they will visit the Amagansett Farmer's Market in nearby Amagansett. More than any other small business, it is a testimony to the increase in conspicuous consumption in the Long Island summer spots.    When Patricia Struk started the Amagansett Farmer's Market 30 years ago, it was nothing more than a farm wagon where she sold flowers. Today it is a booming specialty food store that sells, among other things, poached salmon with herb mayonnaise at $18.50 a pound. &quot;We try to have the best money can buy. It just costs more,&quot; says Mrs. Struk.    While there are still shops for the budget-conscious, virtually everything has a gourmet flair here -- even the shopworn Aandamp;P lets customers pick from a tank teeming with live lobsters.    &quot;People don't bat an eye when they pay $16 a pound for cheese,&quot; says John Hammerley, visiting a group house as folks in the kitchen prepare lamb inside. &quot;They walk in and peel off $50 bills like it's chump change.&quot;    But to those caught up in the summer ritual, this is business as usual. For $34 -- about the same price Greyhound charges for the more than 230-mile trip from New York to Washington, D.C. -- club-class riders on the Hampton Jitney are pampered with two attendants, a de-thorned rose, choice cheeses, champagne and a T-shirt on the 100-mile ride to East Hampton.    With such a monied crowd clamoring to spend money here, shop owners wonder how soon they will have to share the loot with big outsiders. Earlier this year, the Benetton clothes chain opened a shop in nearby Southampton. About a month ago, Ralph Lauren opened a Polo Country Store on Main Street in East Hampton.    Inside Mr. Lauren's store, a crocodile belt sells for $815. A foot-long wooden fish decoy is $150. A deerskin skirt goes for $1,279. &quot;It's hand-painted,&quot; a saleswoman points out. A store manager says business couldn't be better.    This is a town that at one time was a mecca of tiny mom-and-pop businesses. But soaring commercial rents and big-name retailers are edging many small businesses off Main Street.    And as more and more outsiders come to carve out their own little slice of paradise, acres of pastures are turning into front yards for mansions. The village's roads are choked with traffic, irritating old-timers.    After all, just 100 years ago East Hampton proper was a sleepy fishing village. Though some find its charm studied, it still prides itself on being the quaintest of the Long Island summer spots. The Ladies Village Improvement Society still holds an annual fair here, and many residents leave home without locking doors.    Nonetheless, as summer residents stay longer, locals feel their time is passing.    Says Morgan Rank, an eight-year East Hampton local who owns an antique shop on Newtown Lane, &quot;The greed is killing off the natural beauty of this place, the very reasons that have made it so attractive.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
