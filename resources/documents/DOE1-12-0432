Methods have been proposed for the quantitative evaluation ofidentification probability and reliability from line coincidences inthe test and standard spectra. A system has been described for identifyingpolyarenes from their line luminescence spectra in particular in theunselective excitation of unseparated mixtures. The identification correctnesshas been checked on pure solutions and mixtures of known composition.</TEXT></DOC>
