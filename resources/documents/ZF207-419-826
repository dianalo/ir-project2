Although Wolf saidit's too early to tell how badly other U.S.andP;  computer manufacturers will behurt, he expects few will escape unscathed.andM;A stronger valuation of the U.S.andP;  dollar against European currencies is theimmediate reason for concern.andP;  But securities analysts and industryexecutives said that valuation is not the only threat to U.S.andP;  computermanufacturers' European sales.andP;  Perhaps more important, they say, are theincreasing technological prowess and the rising production rates of EuropeanPC manufacturers.andM;Production of PCs in Europe soared by 42 percent last year to 3.2 millionunits from 2.28 million in 1987, according to market researcher DataquestInc., of San Jose, Calif.andM;Local production of PCs now accounts for more than 60 percent of the Europeanmarket.andP;  IBM led all companies with 850,000 PCs produced in Europe last year,but the No.andP;  2 position went to Italy's Ing.andP;  C. Olivetti andamp; Co.andP;  SPA(565,000) and No.andP;  3 was England's Amstrad plc.andP;  (350,000).andM;U.S.andP;  companies are responding to the surge in production by Europeancompetitors by increasing their own manufacturing volumes in Europe.andO;Houston-based Compaq drew nearly 40 percent of its $2.1 billion in sales lastyear from Europe, and last month officials said the firm would spend $37.5million on the second expansion of its Erskine, Scotland, PC manufacturingplant.andM;Increased manufacturing in Europe by U.S.andP;  companies helps meet demand morequickly and also provides protection against currency fluctuations.andP;  &quot;Themore you source your materials locally, the less the impact of currencychanges,&quot; said Eckhard Pfeiffer, president of Compaq's Europe andInternational Division in Munich.andM;Even so, as more companies increase PC production in Europe, the greaternumber of PCs on the market will force prices down.andP;  Certain models of IBM'sPS/2 computers, for instance, were selling at retail stores in Scandinavialast month for at least 20 percent below their comparable U.S.andP;  price, saidWes Nelson, vice president of international sales for PC maker AST ResearchInc., of Irvine, Calif.andM;Against that backdrop, U.S.andP;  manufacturers can no longer count on traditionalEuropean markups of 10 percent to 15 percent above U.S.andP;  pricing.andP;  WithJapanese and other Asian low-cost PC makers expecting to enter the Europeanmanufacturing market by 1992, pricing should become even more hazardous.andM;That leaves U.S.andP;  companies with only their ability in computer technology asan advantage.andP;  One of the reasons ATandamp;T recently selected Intel Corp., ofSanta Clara, Calif., as a second manufacturer for its PCs was that primarymanufacturer Olivetti had fallen behind in technological development, saidRobert Kavner, president of ATandamp;T's Data Systems Group in Morristown, N.J.andM;But even that traditional edge is weakening.andP;  European companies used to be18 months behind their U.S.andP;  rivals, but the developmental time lag in suchtechnologies as faster processors is now only six months.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
