York Gun Costs---By Judith Valente and Andy PasztorStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GDAEROSPACE (ARO)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF) </IN><TEXT>   A federal judge in Los Angeles dismissed criminal fraud charges against General Dynamics Corp. and four executives who had worked on the prototype of the Sgt. York antiaircraft gun, after the Justice Department said it was unable to support the allegations.    The decision could have a chilling effect on efforts to prosecute other large defense contractors suspected of overcharging the Pentagon, government and defense attorneys said. The General Dynamics case was one of the largest of its kind and the first to result in indictments of high-ranking executives, including James M. Beggs, former head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, who was General Dynamics' executive vice president at the time the company worked on the Sgt. York prototype.    The dismissal also was a major victory for General Dynamics. It marked the second time in a month that federal officials declined to proceed with criminal charges against the St. Louis-based company. One of the nation's largest defense contractors, General Dynamics has been the target of numerous inquiries into allegations of misconduct. So far, however, the company has been winning the battles.    In the latest case, federal prosecutors agreed that General Dynamics hadn't acted illegally when it charged $7.5 million in costs for the Sgt. York program to other government accounts, unrelated to Sgt. York, that were earmarked for research and development and bid and proposal work. The labor and material costs charged to those other accounts were &quot;legitimate,&quot; the Justice Department filing said.    Stanley C. Pace, chairman and chief executive officer of the company, said he was &quot;pleased&quot; that the allegations were withdrawn and that &quot;the long, emotional travail&quot; for the four indicted executives is over.    It was unclear whether the Justice Department will drop the civil suit filed against the company in connection with the Sgt. York program. An attorney for the company said he expects the government to drop the civil action since it was based on the criminal fraud charges. Justice Department officials declined to comment on the criminal or civil cases.    In the court filing, prosecutors said only that a lengthy analysis of &quot;documentary and testimonial evidence&quot; convinced them that the $39 million contract for the Sgt. York prototype wasn't a &quot;firm fixed price&quot; contract. That meant, as the company maintained, that General Dynamics was required to show only that it had used its &quot;best efforts&quot; to complete the contract within the amount prescribed.    The company said it spent $13 million of its own funds to finish the program. But the government alleged it dipped into other defense-related accounts to make up for $7.5 million in cost overruns, and sought repayment from the company of $3.2 million in actual losses to the government.    General Dynamics lost the production contract for the Sgt. York to Ford Motor Co. in 1981. When the Pentagon later decided to scrap the problem-plagued weapon, it became the symbol of excess and inefficiency in the defense procurement process.    Mr. Beggs said he believes the General Dynamics indictments grew out of public and political pressure to address those problems, and to hold specific individuals responsible.    &quot;I think it's fine to put the industry under scrutiny. There are crooks in every industry. But you don't go on witch hunts and that's what is going on,&quot; Mr. Beggs said.    Defense attorneys maintained the government's case foundered because prosecutors misunderstood the complex and somewhat arcane terms of the contract.    The outcome marks a major setback for the Justice Department, which had described the case as an important and potentially precedent-setting part of a drive to ferret out defense-procurement fraud. Justice officials often highlighted the case in congressional testimony. Assistant Attorney General William Weld said earlier this year that the outcome of the legal issues raised by the case &quot;could be very significant for the direction and success of future prosecutions&quot; against contractors.    The government's action is likely to provide ammunition to Justice Department critics in Congress, who complain that the Reagan administration has failed to devote enough resources to prosecuting contractor fraud. Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) said the department's efforts in this area have suffered from &quot;long-term management problems and a severe lack of effective enforcement initiatives.&quot;    In addition, the General Dynamics attorneys raised some novel defenses during the course of the 19-month case. Many of the same arguments could resurface and hinder federal prosecution of other contractors, defense and government laywers said.    The other executives who were charged are Ralph E. Hawes Jr., corporate vice president; David McPherson, who was the weapon program director; and James Hansen Jr., who was the contract administrator. The three men still work for General Dynamics. Mr. Beggs resigned as NASA administrator after the indictment and is now a consultant.    Mr. McPherson said the government refused to let the General Dynamics executives explain their interpretation of how the contract was to work before convening a grand jury on the matter. &quot;It took a long 18 months for them to come to the same conclusions,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
