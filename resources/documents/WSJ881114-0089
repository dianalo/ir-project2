How did Japan outstrip us competitively so quickly?    Japan's great energy and tight focus on specific technological targets are certainly a large factor -- but it's also true that the U.S. has been repeatedly shooting itself in the foot for many years.    While the Japanese have been spending more and more on research and development, American commercial Randamp;D is stagnating, and at some important companies, even declining. One ironic sidelight to this: The corporate restructurings that have been ballyhooed as making us lean and mean, better able to compete, often result in the gutting of research and will actually make us less able to grapple with the Japanese challenge in years to come.    When U.S. corporations have come up with useful research or raw technology, they often have been very slow to exploit it -- and have sold it for a song to Japanese companies that then began beating us with our own sticks. Finally, while the U.S. government wrings its hands over the competitiveness issue, it has itself been giving away priceless research to the Japanese, just for the asking. For free.    Some of it comes from the national laboratories, whose work is funded directly by the U.S. taxpayer. Under federal law, all non-classified research results from the labs are in the public domain, available to anyone at nominal cost or no cost. &quot;The labs are a tremendous resource, and American industry isn't using them anywhere near as much as it should.&quot; says Gail Fosler, staff economist on the Senate budget committee. &quot;But a number of Japanese firms are sitting at the feet of these labs.&quot;    They have gotten considerable information from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. There, John Hallquist is considered a resident genius: His Dyna, Nike and Taurus supercomputer codes make fantastically accurate simulations, with wide applications in industry. The Japanese wanted them.    So, a company called Japan Information Service Ltd. sent a man from Tokyo to ask Mr. Hallquist for the programs. Sure, said Mr. Hallquist. Then the man from Tokyo asked if he could sell the codes back in Japan. &quot;I don't care. Go ahead,&quot; said Mr. Hallquist.    Soon after, the Japanese company, a unit of giant Sumitomo Bank, was selling Dyna, Nike and Taurus all over Japan. Meantime, Mr. Hallquist himself began sending off copies of his latest work to Toyota Motor, Suzuki Motor, Hitachi, Mitsubishi Research Institute and the Japan Atomic Energy Commission. (Auto companies, for example, can use the codes to simulate car crashes, saving money and time in designing crash-worthy cars, and nuclear-plant operators can use them to figure out what happens inside a nuclear reactor.)    Mr. Hallquist argues that people in Europe and Japan help him debug his programs, and he adds that TRW, General Motors and other American companies also get copies of his valuable codes. It isn't Mr. Hallquist's fault that the Japanese have been more aggressive in seeking and using them.    Such giveaways have been going on for many years. James Beggs has a vivid recollection of one instance during the Nixon administration. Mr. Beggs, then undersecretary of transportation and future head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, was on an official trip to Japan, where he watched as the U.S. delegation gave away to the Japanese government all of America's space technology.    &quot;I was aghast.&quot; Mr. Beggs recalls, &quot;That was $100 billion of technology and we just gave it to them -- for nothing. It was immensely valuable to them.&quot;    If the U.S. government has given away a lot of its research, American corporations, too, have given away -- or sold for a song -- some of their most valuable work. They have lived to regret it.    Two days before Christmas in 1947, three men at Bell Laboratories invented the transistor, but four years later the parent company, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., failed to commercialize it fully. So ATandamp;T put it up for sale -- $25,000 for a nonexclusive right to use the technology.    Texas Instruments bought a license, made a transistor, and had it put into the Regency radio, which, in 1954, was the first transistor radio. A struggling Japanese company also spent $25,000 for a license, and made a radio called the Sony. Within three years, Sony had blown away the Regency and several other American entries.    In years to come, technology poured out of the U.S. to overseas companies. In terms of value of licenses, the U.S. exported more than 10 times as much technology as it imported in the 1960s and 1970s, and much of that technology was sold to Japan.    RCA sold its television technology, and Japanese companies went about making world-class TV sets. Ampex sold its video-recording secrets, and Japanese companies took over the VCR market while Ampex dropped out. Honeywell transferred computer technology to NEC in the 1960s, and in the ultimate ironic twist, NEC now owns part of Honeywell's computer business, and Honeywell is the marketing agent for NEC supercomputers.    Today, Japan still buys U.S. technology even as it develops its own. The U.S. still spends more money on research than any nation in the world. But Japanese commercial Randamp;D spending is growing at a far-greater rate than U.S. spending for the same purpose, and Japan now spends a higher percentage of its GNP on commercial research than the U.S. does.    American companies generally seem unalarmed by this. A survey this past summer by Boston Consulting Group showed that over 95% of Japanese top executives strongly believe that a big push has to be made in Randamp;D over the next five years. In the U.S., only about 60% saw the need for a strong push.    Some big U.S. corporations are actually cutting back on Randamp;D. Last year, according to Standard andamp; Poors Corp., General Electric cut its research spending by 8%. Exxon reduced its by 15%. Even IBM increased its Randamp;D spending by only 1%, a drop in real terms.    Some American research labs have been all but gutted in the past few years. Some have been victims of consolidation through merger or acquisition. &quot;Every time you have an acquisition, Randamp;D is one of the hardest hit,&quot; says W. Halder Fisher, a senior researcher at Battelle Memorial Institute, a non-profit research organization in Columbus, Ohio.    Other now-diminished labs belong to companies that have assumed huge debt burdens in restructurings -- some of them taken on in connection with attempts, successful or unsuccessful, to fend off raiders.    As a result, research and development directors at major corporations today consider themselves an endangered species, and at industry meetings jokingly say they have reverted to &quot;hunting and gathering.&quot;    Borg-Warner, for example, gutted its corporate research lab in 1987, after piling up $2 billion of debt in defending itself in the face of takeover threats by corporate raiders Samuel Heyman and Irwin Jacobs. The former director of the lab, Donald Hoeg, is bitter about the severe cutback.    Says Mr. Hoeg, &quot;The Japanese must be looking at this and saying, 'Here they are hobbling from the competition, and now the Americans are shooting themselves in the foot.'&quot;    In another case, CPC International shut down a lab that did long-range research in the biosciences and chemistry after an attempted takeover by Ronald Perelman of Revlon Group. &quot;When Perelman hit us, he looked at us as a fat cow.&quot; says Morris Danzig, the former director of the lab, near Chicago. &quot;So we decided we'd become lean and mean. But we also lost the next step in our survival -- our adaptability.&quot;    The erosion of American strength in Randamp;D, in large part, is due to an obsession with short-term financial results. The Japanese take the opposite tack. In a recent study by Booz-Allen andamp; Hamilton, the New York consultants, 59% of the U.S. chief executives surveyed said their performance was measured over a period of less than one year. Among Japanese executives, only 2% believed they were measured over a span of one year or less.    The problem facing the U.S. today isn't just a matter of spending levels, though. At a time when interesting technological developments are occurring world-wide, the anecdotal evidence, at least, suggests that the U.S. isn't really making the global search for the seeds of new ideas: It has been too long accustomed to developing its own. Japan, by contrast, has a national obsession with the gathering of information.    As students, young Japanese flock to the coffee shops of Tokyo's Shibuya district, where they compete with each other to name, for example, the absolutely trendiest Manhattan restaurants and nightclubs of the moment. Never mind that they have never been to America and never met an American. There is status in having the very latest information. The adult version of the same game is played with a passion in government offices, corporations and academia.    Hajime Karatsu, a former Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. executive and today a professor at Tokai University in Tokyo, is especially proud that his office contains no books. &quot;Books have old information. I need the latest. Even magazines aren't enough,&quot; he says.    Even scientific information about the U.S. -- for example the documents flowing out of the National Technical Information Service -- are avidly devoured in Japan. NTIS says some of its best customers are in Tokyo.    Many American executives still seem to have no appreciation of the gravity of the Japanese threat. Speaking before a group of 20 American executives in Westchester, N.Y., last May, Erich Bloch, director of the National Science Foundation, got the typical response: indifference.    Mr. Bloch tried to tell them what Japanese energy and ingenuity were doing to the U.S., and wondered why executives didn't feel a greater sense of urgency. In this particular room in suburban New York, with fine wine and fine food and well-pressed American executives, urgency was conspicuously lacking. One executive commented, &quot;Erich makes it sound like Pearl Harbor all over again. He must be fighting for his budget.&quot;    Another sign of indifference: At a time when Japanese science is beginning to blossom, only a small number of U.S. companies have bothered to put research laboratories on the ground in Japan. In electronics, where Japanese gains have been most pronounced, there seems to be little U.S. inclination to learn from them.    &quot;Of the 350 big American electronics companies, not more than 10 have Randamp;D labs here,&quot; says John Stern, director of the American Electronics Association's office in Tokyo. &quot;American executives think either that they're behind, and give up, or think they're still ahead and don't need to worry. Many U.S. companies are playing Russian roulette by ignoring Japanese companies. The first five times, they might be okay. But the sixth time, they'll be wiped out.&quot;    ---                   Randamp;D: A Bigger Push in Japan   A recent Boston Consulting Group/Wall Street Journal poll of 378 senior executives in three countries finds that the U.S. and West Germany are more complacent about Randamp;D than Japan is.   To ensure success, more Japanese managers see the need to increase their budgets and human resources during the next five years, especially in the area of Randamp;D.

Percent strongly agreeing their companies are trying to catch up:    U.S.                                          36%    Japan                                         98    W.
