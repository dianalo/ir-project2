Earlier this month, Canada's House of Commons passed a bill to ban tobacco advertising in newspapers and magazines Jan. 1 and begin phasing out promotions of athletic and cultural events by tobacco companies in 1989. The House also passed a bill to prohibit smoking in federally regulated work places and on federally regulated transportation. If enacted, the bills would be among the toughest anti-tobacco laws in the world.    A spokesman for tobacco manufacturers said yesterday that the companies haven't yet decided whether to mount a constitutional challenge to the bill banning tobacco advertising.    Almost two-thirds of the tobacco advertising Canadians see is from ads in U.S. magazines, which won't be affected by the advertising ban. Tobacco advertising on Canadian radio and television already has been banned.    Members of the Senate are appointed, not elected, and the Senate almost always passes bills approved by the House. </TEXT></DOC>
