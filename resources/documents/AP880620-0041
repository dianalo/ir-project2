On the west, Haiti faces Cuba and theCaribbean Sea. To the east is the Spanish-speaking DominicanRepublic, which covers the eastern, more fertile, two-thirds of theisland of Hispaniola.</TEXT><HEAD>THE PEOPLE:</HEAD><TEXT>   Ninety-five percent of Haitians are descendants of Africanslaves brought to the New World to cut sugar cane. A great slaverevolt led by former slave Toussaint L'Ouverture eventually led tovictory over Napoleon's troops and independence from France on Jan.1, 1804. Haiti was the first black republic in history. Today, itis the Western Hemisphere's poorest country. Life expectancy is 54years, per capita income $379 a year, and 85 of every 100 Haitianslive in absolute poverty. Only 13 of 100 Haitians have access topotable water. Thousands, including about 15,000 abandoned ororphaned children, live and sleep in the streets of the capital,Port-au-Prince, without shelter, sanitary facilities or othernecessities. Only about 60,000 of the country's 6 million peoplelive what would be considered in the United States a middle classlifestyle. These priviledged few, mostly light-skinned mulattos,own about 46 percent of the national wealth.</TEXT><HEAD>HISTORY:</HEAD><TEXT>   Following independence, Haiti ruled the entire island ofHispaniola from 1818 to 1839. U.S. troops occupied Haiti from 1915to 1934 following a long period of instability. After World War II,a 10-year boom brought foreign investment, tourism and public workson a grand scale, although little was done to increase publicservices for the poor. Another period of turmoil culminated in 1957with the election of Francois Duvalier, a doctor who declaredhimself president for life in 1964. ``Papa Doc,'' as he was called,died in 1971 and was succeeded by his 19-year-old son, Jean-Claude.The Duvalier family amassed an immense fortune and created thenotorious Tonton Macoutes, a vicious private militia that throttledpolitical opposition by arresting, torturing and killing at will.Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier fled to exile in France inFebruary 1986 after food riots grew into nationwide anti-governmentdemonstrations. A military-civilian junta led by Lt. Gen. HenriNamphy took power and agreed to hold elections. An independentlyrun election Nov. 29 was suspended because of widespread violencethat the army made no effort to stop. On Jan. 24, Leslie F.Manigat, a 57-year-old former political science professor, wasdeclared the winner in the election that critics claim wasfraudulent. His government was installed in February. Manigatretired Namphy as commander in chief of Haiti's 7,000-man army onFriday, charging him with insubordination in ordering the transferof lower-ranking officers three days earlier. Late Sunday, Namphyled a coup that ousted Namphy.</TEXT></DOC>
