Square D, based in Palatine, Ill., disclosed the talks ina filing with the Securities and Exchange Commissionyesterday. Company officials didn't return calls seekingcomment on the filing.</LP><TEXT>   A Groupe Schneider spokesman declined comment on thefiling.   Rumors that Square D might turn to a friendly corporatesuitor to avoid the grasp of Paris-based Groupe Schneiderhave helped push Square D's stock price above Schneider'soffer of $78 a share, or $1.98 billion, in recent days.Yesterday. Square D closed at $79.375, unchanged, in New YorkStock Exchange composite trading.   Square D's filing didn't identify the potential friendlysuitors. Companies most often mentioned by analysts andtakeover stock speculators as being able to top the$78-a-share price include Siemens AG, Hanson PLC andMitsubishi Group, although none has publicly expressed aninterest in doing so.   Groupe Schneider first proposed the buy-out to Square D'sboard Feb. 19. The board rejected the proposal Feb. 28, andSchneider then took its $78-a-share bid directly toshareholders by means of a tender offer that is scheduled toexpire March 29.   In another move apparently designed to buy time inmounting a defense, Square D on Sunday said that it pushedback its annual meeting to May 24 from late April. GroupeSchneider has taken steps to unseat a majority of Square D'sdirectors at the meeting. Schneider, which filed suit inDelaware last week to obtain a list of Square D shareholders,said yesterday that Square D has agreed to provide it withthe list.   Since Square D has pushed back its annual meeting, itapparently will have to reset the record date, which setsthat date by which shareholders must have acquired the stockin order to vote at the meeting. Pushing back that date wouldenable Square D to sell a block of stock to a friendly holderwho could be counted on to vote against Schneider at theannual meeting.   One stock trader summed up Square D's defensive scrambleby saying: &quot;If they can find some way to stay independent,they will. If not, they are looking to other alternatives tocompete on an economic basis. They're giving themselves timeto see if there's any alternative.&quot;   Another trader pointed to the language in the announcementabout joint ventures, saying that Square D may be looking fora partner who would buy a block of its stock for strategicbusiness reasons as opposed to a purely financial investor.</TEXT></DOC>
