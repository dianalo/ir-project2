LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Exxon Corp., the nation's largest oil company,entered this year on a ``definite earnings upswing'' despite twoyears of severe oil price volatility and market disruptions,Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl said Thursday at the company's annualmeeting.   Exxon's net income of $1.46 billion for the first quarter of1988 was up 36 percent over the first quarter of 1987, even thoughaverage crude oil prices in this year's first quarter were about $2a barrel lower than the first quarter last year, Rawl said.   ``The effect of these declining oil prices on our explorationand production earnings was cushioned somewhat by increasedproduction from new and existing fields,'' Rawl said of the NewYork-based corporation. ``More importantly, however, petroleumproduct prices _ both here and abroad _ were relatively firm.''   Firm prices helped improve margins in Exxon's refining andmarketing sectors, said Rawl, who added that the company alsoprofited from sharp production increases in its chemical operations.   ``After two consecutive years of record earnings, chemicalsbegan this year with the best quarterly earnings ever,'' Rawl said.   The company last month reported first quarter earnings of $1.06per share, up 41 percent over the first quarter of 1987.   Exxon spent $1.8 billion in 1987 to acquire producing oil andgas properties in the United States, Canada and Australia and thecompany plans to continue investment in high-quality, attractivelypriced reserves, Rawl said.   In an effort to make exploratory drilling ventures morecost-effective, the company is concentrating on a select group ofhigh-quality prospects _ a policy that led to significantdiscoveries last year in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,Australia and Columbia, Rawl said.   ``This success,'' Rawl said, ``has encouraged us to budget anincrease from 184 to about 240 exploratory wells this year.''   Exxon also invested about $524 million in overall research anddevelopment last year, including research into new generationsynthetic fuel technologies, Rawl said. He said the research willallow Exxon to take advantage of its sizeable holdings of coal, oilshale and other resources.   ``Continuing to operate in a very difficult and uncertainbusiness environment requires us to continue improving ourefficiency and keep a sharp eye on near-term performance,'' Rawlsaid. ``We must look further out and invest in those emergingtechnologies that are essential for our company's long-term growthand profitability.''</TEXT></DOC>
