The study found that both Zantac, marketed by Glaxo of theU.K., and Tagamet, made by SmithKline Beecham of the U.K.,can cause the blood alcohol level after less than two drinksto rise above the legal limit for driving an automobile.</LP><TEXT>   The same study, however, found that Merck's Pepcidanti-ulcer drug hasn't any such effect.   Zantac, one of the world's top-selling drugs, accounts forabout $2.5 billion in annual sales. Tagamet is thesecond-leading ulcer remedy at about $1 billion, and Pepcidis third at $600 million.   All three products belong to a class of drugs known asH2-receptor blockers that inhibit production of ulcer-causingstomach acids. The study indicates that Zantac and Tagametalso thwart action of a stomach enzyme that is the first stepin the body's breakup of alcohol molecules.   Lack of the enzyme allows more unchanged alcohol to reachthe bloodstream. As a result, a person taking either of thetwo drugs could essentially get drunk on just a drink and ahalf, explained Charles S. Lieber, director of the AlcoholResearch and Treatment Center at Bronx Veterans AffairsMedical Center and Mount Sinai School of Medicine in NewYork.   &quot;The amount of alcohol used in a social setting canincrease blood alcohol to a level that can impair functionwhen it comes to driving or operating machinery,&quot; said Dr.Lieber, the principal investigator on the study.   The study involved 20 healthy men from 24 to 46 years old,eight of whom took Zantac, six took Tagamet and six tookPepcid. Blood tests were taken between 15 minutes and twohours and 45 minutes after each man had taken the equivalentof one and a half cans of beer, one and a half glasses ofwine or one and a half drinks of 86-proof spirits.   Among the men taking Zantac, peak blood alcohol levelswere 34% higher on average than when the same men had alcoholwithout the ulcer medicines, the study found. For those onTagamet, blood alcohol levels were 92% higher than when themen weren't taking the drug. Differences in blood alcohollevels among the Pepcid takers weren't significant.   Dr. Leiber said either the dose or the chemical structureof Pepcid could explain why the drug didn't appear to inhibitthe work of the enzyme that matabolizes alcohol. The normaldose for Tagamet is 800 to 1,000 milligrams a day, he said,and 300 milligrams for Zantac. For Pepcid, it is 40milligrams a day.   Dr. Lieber and his colleagues didn't test Axid, another H2blocker marketed by Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly andamp; Co., orLosec, a different type of ulcer drug, also made by Merck,based in Rahway, N.J.   The study was funded by the U.S. Departments of VeteransAffairs and Health and Human Services and by a foundation inFinland. Drug companies weren't involved in supporting theresearch, Dr. Leiber said.</TEXT></DOC>
