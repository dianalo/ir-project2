The announcement by President F.W. de Klerk -- the latestin a series of moves to normalize the country's politicalsituation -- repeals an array of regulations that gave thegovernment and police extraordinary powers to curb politicaldissent through bannings, detention without trial and presscensorship. However, Mr. de Klerk said the emergency willremain in effect in Natal province, where violence betweenopposing black groups is common. More than 3,000 blacks havedied in Natal's political violence over the past three years.</LP><TEXT>   Most opposition organizations welcomed the end of theemergency while also pointing out that more remained to bedone to level the political playing field for oppositiongroups and eliminate apartheid, or racial segregation. Still,it does move the government a step closer to meeting thepreconditions of the African National Congress for joiningPretoria in full-scale negotiations over a new constitution.In addition to the lifting of the emergency, the ANC demandsthe release of all political prisoners and the return of allexiles to South Africa. After initial talks last monthbetween the ANC and the government, the two sides are closeto finalizing details for fulfilling these two demands.   The government's decision to lift the emergency comesshortly after Mr. de Klerk's return from Europe, where, hesays, he sensed a willingness by some governments to reviewtheir sanctions once the emergency was ended. Many of themeasures restricting trade and commerce with South Africawere imposed as a response to Pretoria's declaration of theemergency in June 1986. That move also triggered a wave ofdisinvestment by European and U.S. corporations.   By lifting the emergency, Pretoria is also hoping toundercut Nelson Mandela's current tour through Europe andNorth America. The African National Congress leader, whospent 27 years in prison before being released in February,is campaigning for sanctions to be maintained untilnegotiations between the government and the black majorityover a new constitution are well under way.   In Paris, Mr. Mandela said the lifting of the emergencywas a &quot;victory for the people of South Africa, both black andwhite.&quot; But, he added, &quot;it doesn't change my mind&quot; aboutsanctions.   Mr. Mandela, who is scheduled to arrive in the U.S. June20, argues that any lessening of the sanctions pressure nowwill lead Pretoria to slow down its pace of reforms. The ANCalso believes that sanctions are necessary to prod thegovernment's thinking on a new constitution: While the ANCdemands a one-man, one-vote system, the government rejectssimple majority rule and insists on protections for minorityrights. The ANC says this is apartheid in another guise.   By ending the emergency, Mr. de Klerk is turning up somepressure of his own on the ANC, particularly to renounce itsarmed struggle. After last month's initial talks aimed atclearing away the stumbling blocks for constitutionalnegotiations, the government pledged to review the emergencyand the ANC promised to reassess its guerrilla campaign. Mr.de Klerk said the government has fulfilled its part of theagreement, and he called on the ANC to do likewise.   &quot;We are on the threshold of the real negotiation processand the time has come for other important role players to dotheir bit,&quot; Mr. de Klerk said. &quot;In particular, the ANC mustnow stop vacillating.&quot;   Mr. de Klerk challenged Mr. Mandela to stop advocatingguerrilla activity and criticized his statement earlier thisweek that the ANC approves of organized violence againstchosen targets. The ANC argues that its armed strugglecontinues to be necessary as long as apartheid is still inplace.   The government, which has embarked on a series of reformssince it unbanned the ANC in February, is dependent on theANC's cooperation to fend off the white right wing. As thewhite electorate watches the government make one concessionafter another to the black majority, the pro-apartheidConservative Party is steadily eroding the support of theruling National Party. In a parliamentary by-electionWednesday, the Conservatives fell only 500 votes short ofcapturing a traditionally safe National Party seat. LastOctober, the National Party won the seat by 3,000 votes.   The Conservatives will make further gains should unrestflare up after the lifting of the emergency. ConservativeParty leader Andries Treurnicht called the government move,&quot;another concession to the ANC.&quot;   Still, the government has plenty of power under othersecurity legislation to restrict political activity andcontrol unrest by using the law and the courts. Mr. de Klerkalso announced plans to beef up the police force.   Under the emergency, the police were protected againstprosecution for many of their actions and governmentministers could act without consulting parliament. As aresult, more than 30,000 people were detained in the pastfour years, some two dozen organizations were banned,political rallies were outlawed at will and severalnewspapers were shut down for various periods of time. Thecountry's legal system was rendered virtually powerless, asjudges' discretion was generally limited to ruling whether aparticular action was covered by the emergency decree.</TEXT></DOC>
