Gordon Crovitz's interesting article &quot;Meet the Legal Extremists&quot; (editorial page, Sept. 22) and I would like to quibble with what is perhaps a minor part of the article, but one that has significance to those who know and have affection for the Yale Law School. In the article Mr. Crovitz says that &quot;The Yale Law Journal organizers of a recent debate on the Bork nomination found five professors to speak against Judge Bork and only one . . . who favored the nomination.&quot; I think the members of the panel would have been surprised to hear that that was the &quot;vote&quot; or lineup. The New Haven Register, reporting the panel, described three members as opposing Judge Bork. Several members of the panel neither supported nor opposed, but talked about the relationship, or lack of relationship, between the views of Judge Bork and others as professor, and actions that Judge Bork or other professors might take on courts. This is a point Judge Bork subsequently emphasized in the confirmation hearings.    More important than the views of the panelists is the erroneous impression possibly left by Mr. Crovitz's article that only one member of this faculty favors the nomination. That is simply not the case. I wouldn't and shouldn't make any systematic investigation of the matter. But my recent impressions are that two or three members of this faculty are testifying against the nomination, and two or three are testifying in favor. I know, in addition, of some powerful letters sent by members of this faculty to the Senate Judiciary Committee supporting the nomination. I don't doubt that there have been others sent in opposition.    Speaking to people in the hallways, my impression is that there are many faculty members who, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, tend in favor, and there are many who tend against, as well as some who haven't made up their minds.    Sen. Kennedy apparently made much of the fact that on a list of professors opposed to Judge Bork, there were nine members of this faculty. Another newspaper made much of the fact that some 300 students had signed a petition opposing Judge Bork. Our faculty numbers somewhere between 50 and 60, depending on how one counts visitors, joint appointments, etc. Our student body is close to 600. I'm not for a moment asserting that only nine professors or 300 students oppose Judge Bork. I do assert that such numbers on petitions should not seem surprising or shocking on an issue which has, one must admit, divided the country.    Honorable people oppose Judge Bork. Honorable people support him. Mr. Crovitz's article is a serious and careful criticism of some of Judge Bork's opponents. But it does no service to Judge Bork or to his school or to that criticism to exaggerate the opposition to Judge Bork or the loneliness of his supporters.
