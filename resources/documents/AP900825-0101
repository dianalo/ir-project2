PUTNAM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Iraqi authorities stepped up pressure onforeign diplomatic missions in occupied Kuwait on Saturday, cuttingoff water, power and telephone service and deploying heavily armedtroops nearby.   But there was apparently no effort to remove diplomats by force,according to reports reaching foreign ministries of the countriesinvolved. In Washington, Iraq's ambasador said ``we are not goingto use force'' against the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait.   ``We haven't touched any embassy there,'' the Iraqi diplomatsaid at an impromptu news conference at the State Department.   However, Baghdad warned its own citizens that hiding foreignerswould be considered ``an act of espionage punishable by death.''Iraqi officials had already issued harsh warnings against harboringforeigners.   The Iraqi ambassador to Washington, Sadiq al-Mashat, also saidSaturday that American diplomats who earlier left Kuwait forBaghdad would be treated ``just like anybody else'' _ in otherwords, that they no longer had diplomtic immunity. But he saidtheir dependents would be allowed to leave Iraq.   About 100 U.S. diplomats and dependents had fled Kuwait for Iraqlate Thursday, arriving in a 33-car caravan after more than 19hours on the road.   According to the Bush administration, their safe passage out ofthe area was assured by Iraq. But while they were en route, Iraqimposed what it said were new regulations prohibiting the departureof diplomats whose embassies had not shut down as ordered bySaddam. This left the diplomats and their families stranded at theU.S. Embassy in the Iraqi capital.   Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser, saidnegotiations were under way in Baghdad to permit the departure ofthe diplomats and dependents.   Meanwhile, the official Iraqi News Agency reported that hundredsof Iraqi children marched to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad onSaturday carrying signs complaining that the international tradeembargo against Iraq is depriving them of milk. The protest likelyhad official sanction.   The Iraqi government has threatened to deprive Western childrenstranded in Iraq and Kuwait of food and medicine if supplies arecut for Iraqi children.   The United States, Canada, Japan, Bangladesh, Switzerland,Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and the 12 EuropeanCommunity nations were among those who announced they would remainin Kuwait, defying an Iraqi order to shut down.   In London, the No. 2 man at the Foreign Office, WilliamWaldegrave, said more than 30 embassies were still functioning inKuwait. He said electric power at the British Embassy had been cutoff again after being restored earlier in the day.   Similar reports were received in Paris, Rome, Vienna, Oslo andTokyo, although the numbers of soldiers outside the compoundsvaried. The troops patrolling outside some of the embassies werearmed with machine guns and mortars, the reports said.   The U.S. Ambassador in Kuwait, Nathaniel Howell, and about 10other Americans stayed at the American compound.   Iraqi troops appeared outside the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait City onThursday night and, according to U.S. officials, have blocked entryand exit since.   Electricity and water were cut off Saturday, but Iraqi troopsaround the diplomatic mission have not attempted to close it, U.S.officials said. They said the embassy was operating on generatorpower.   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said the administration hadexpressed its objections through diplomatic channels in Baghdad,Kuwait and Washington.   ``The embassy continues to function. It is carrying out itsconsular functions,'' said Popadiuk, in Maine with the vacationingBush.   The Voice of America radio advised the 2,500 Americans trappedin Kuwait not to go near the embassy while the soldiers remained.   A State Department broadcast on VOA said the embassy was``determined to continue working for your release from Kuwait andyour safe return to your families.''   In Rome, Foreign Ministry officials said soldiers beganpatrolling around the Italian mission in the morning. Electricitywent off in the early afternoon, but the embassy was able to keepits lights on with a generator.   An Italian Foreign Ministry official said the Iraqis had damagedthe wall around the French compound as they were working to cut offthe water. In Paris, the Foreign Ministry said it was trying toverify the report. A half-dozen French Embassy personnel remainedin the mission.   The Norwegian Foreign Ministry said power and water had been cutat its embassy.   Iraq annexed Kuwait after invading it on Aug. 2. Officials inBaghdad decreed that all embassies there must close on Friday andsaid diplomats remaining in Kuwait would lose their diplomaticimmunity.   According to Article 45 of the Vienna Convention on diplomaticrelations, foreign missions are to remain inviolable even in timesof armed conflict.   Many governments believed closing their missions could beinterpreted as the first step toward recognition of Iraq's claim ofsovereignty over Kuwait. Other governments, including the SovietUnion, said that they would remove their diplomats for reasons ofsecurity, but that this was not implicit recognition of the claim.   In Tokyo, a Foreign Ministry official said water, electricityand telephone lines to the Japanese Embassy were cut off Saturdaywithout notification.   There were no reports that soldiers had made any move to takecontrol of the complex, where two diplomats remained. The diplomatswere told on Friday that their diplomatic immunity had beenrevoked, however.   The Greek mission and many others maintained skeleton staffs.Some, including Poland and Spain, had just one diplomat present.</TEXT></DOC>
