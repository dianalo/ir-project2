The NNDC uses methods consisting of nuclearsystematics and nuclear model codes to provide neutron and proton inducedreaction data from 1 MeV and 1 GeV. The data can be placed in convenientform for use by radiation transport codes. In addition to cross-sections,nuclear structure and radioactive decay data are also stored in databases. Data are distributed by the NNDC in a variety of ways includingon-line access through computer networks or telephone lines. 7 refs.,7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
