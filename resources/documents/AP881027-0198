(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jessica Hahn's former pastor was indictedThursday on charges that he skimmed $90,000 from his congregationand then tried to persuade Ms. Hahn, the church's secretary, to lieabout it to a grand jury.   The Rev. Eugene Profeta, 51, used the money to buy lifeinsurance, buy stocks in his wife's name, pay for family functionsand finance gambling junkets to Atlantic City in a church-ownedplane, according to the charges handed up by an Albany County grandjury.   Profeta, to whom Ms. Hahn said she turned for guidance after her1980 sexual encounter with PTL founder Jim Bakker, was charged withtax evasion, perjury and tampering with a witness.   He pleaded innocent and was released on $25,000 bail. He wasordered to surrender his passport, pilot's license and gun licenseand also ordered to stay away from Ms. Hahn.   Ms. Hahn welcomed the court order of protection, but said she wasstill afraid of Profeta, who she alleged had threatened her in thepast.   ``He has asked me to lie for him. I didn't lie. There's a lot ofreason to believe that he's more than angry,'' Ms. Hahn said in atelephone interview from the Playboy offices in Los Angeles. ``Heblames me for the entire investigation.''   ``Yeah, I am afraid,'' she said. ``I feel there are too many ofhis people floating around. I've been threatened in the past.''   Ms. Hahn, who has been living in Phoenix while doing a radioshow, declined to say what she had told the grand jury, other thanto repeat allegations that Profeta had asked her to help him concealwrongdoing.   Ms. Hahn, in text accompanying a nude pictorial in the Septemberissue of Playboy, said Profeta ``showered her with attention andconvinced her that heavy petting with the pastor was part of herrole as church secretary, babysitter and consort and would leave herstill technically a virgin.''   The text noted that Profeta ``mesmerized young Jessica with acombination of fire, brimstone, money and sex.''   In July 1981 Profeta ``persuaded Jessica to have sexualintercourse with him for the first time,'' the magazine said.   ``He said I'm going to prove to you that I'm not like Jim andJohn,'' Ms. Hahn said in the article. ``He was going to show me howwomen should be treated.''   The magazine said she later began a ``full-fledged romance'' withProfeta.   The charges allege that between 1984 and 1986, Profeta and hiswife, Glenda, used as their personal funds money taken from the FullGospel Tabernacle Church in Massapequa, N.Y., a non-denominationalChristian church where Profeta was the pastor. The indictment alsoalleged that the Profetas failed to declare the income on their NewYork state tax returns.   The indictment charged that Profeta tried to persuade Ms. Hahn tolie to the grand jury about gifts she received from him, includingfur coats, casino trips, hotel stays, jewelry, apartment rent andautomobile payments.   The grand jury had been investigating Profeta since the summer of1987, shortly after the Bakker-Hahn scandal broke.   A year ago, Ms. Hahn appeared before the grand jury and toldreporters afterward that Profeta's church group was ``a world justas disturbed'' as that of Bakker and his PTL television ministry.   Since the publicity about her involvement with Bakker, Ms. Hahnhas been featured in Playboy interviews and nude pictorials and hasstayed at the Playboy mansion in California.   Albany County Judge Joseph Harris issued the protection order forMs. Hahn at the request of Assistant Attorney General Peter Crusco,despite contentions by Profeta's lawyer that it would add to a``media circus'' surrounding the case and deprive Profeta of a fairtrial.   The attorney, John Gross, said the order implied that thetampering allegations against the minister were true. Harrisresponded there was no such implication and Profeta would receive afair trial.   ``These charges represent a scheme to cheat the state and alllaw-abiding taxpayers,'' said Attorney General Robert Abrams. ``Butmore importantly, Rev. Profeta allegedly abused the not-for-profitstatus of a religious organization for his own personal gain.''   Gross refused to discuss the case with reporters.   In setting the $25,000 bail, Harris said he wanted assurancesfrom Gross that the money wasn't from church funds. Crusco had askedfor $100,000 bail, while Gross had argued that no bail was neededbecause of Profeta's position in the community.   ``This man has been a minister for over 30 years,'' Gross said.``He's got a congregation of over 1,000. There is no proof to thesecharges.''   Profeta was charged with three counts of offering a falseinstrument for filing, two counts of tax evasion, six counts offalsifying business records, one count of attempted perjury, threecounts of witness tampering and three counts of criminalsolicitation.   Mrs. Profeta, 44, was indicted on three counts of offering afalse instrument for filing and two counts of tax evasion. Her casewas postponed until next month because she is recuperating at homefrom an infection she contracted after surgery, Gross said.   The Profetas each face a maximum of four years in prison ifconvicted of tax evasion and offering a false instrument for filing,the most serious charges.</TEXT></DOC>
