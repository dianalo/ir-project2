Many of these questions -- such as whether anyone couldsue for defamation as a result of the rain of invective andhow much of such testimony would be admissible in a courtcase -- have been subjects of great debate over the years incourts across the nation.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   Defamation                                                                                                          When Sen. Arlen Specter accused Prof. Anita Hill of&quot;flat-out perjury,&quot; he was speaking with complete immunityfrom libel or slander lawsuits.   That's because Sen. Specter, along with every member ofthe U.S. House and Senate, is protected by Article I, Section6, of the Constitution, which provides that &quot;for any speechor debate in either House, {members} shall not be questionedin any other place.&quot; The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled thatthis provision also covers staffers conducting congressionalbusiness on behalf of members.   But both for members of Congress and for their staffs, theprotection is limited to the congressional chamber or hearingroom: It does not extend to statements made to the press. TheU.S. Supreme Court made this explicit in 1979, when it ruledthat Sen. William Proxmire could be sued for libel by aresearcher whose government-financed work with monkeys waslampooned by Sen. Proxmire's Golden Fleece of the MonthAward.   There's little question that any congressional staffer wholeaked the Federal Bureau of Investigation report on Prof.Hill's allegations would be subject to possible suits byProf. Hill for both defamation and invasion of privacy.   The leak wouldn't be covered by the congressional immunityfrom libel suits, because it wouldn't be part of officialcongressional business. And, since Prof. Hill was promisedconfidentiality, release of the report could be found toviolate her right to privacy, although there's someuncertainty in the law about whether the release of truestatements can trigger a privacy lawsuit. However, shecouldn't sue for any privacy violations that occurred duringthe Senate hearings themselves.   Lawyers agree, however, that allegations of perjury orother criminal activity, if false, are particularly ripeground for defamation suits, if uttered outside an officialproceeding. &quot;Accusing a person of a crime is . . . libel perse. You don't even have to prove damages, because it's soobviously damaging to reputation,&quot; says Prof. C. ThomasDienes, a First Amendment specialist at George WashingtonUniversity law school.   Witnesses who spoke for and against Judge Thomas withinthe committee room spoke with less protection than did thesenators, because witnesses are not included in the Speech orDebate Clause of the Constitution. But, under prevailing caselaw, such witnesses do have what's called a qualifiedimmunity from defamation suits, meaning that they cannot besued successfully for false statements unless they know thestatements are false and make them with ill will.   &quot;If they are stating honest beliefs, even if mistaken, thequalified privilege won't be pierced,&quot; says Bruce Sanford, alibel lawyer at Baker andamp; Hostetler in Washington, D.C. &quot;But ifthere are calculated falsehoods made out of misguidedpolitical interest, that's where the libel lawsuit might findfertile territory.&quot;   Could Prof. Hill sue Judge Thomas or vice versa, fordefamation? Lawyers say such suits are possible, if notprobable, if one of the two is lying with sufficient ill willto defeat the usual qualified immunity.   In any such suit, however, lawyers say that Judge Thomaswould clearly qualify as a public figure. This means that ifhe were to sue anyone for defamation, he would have to provethrough clear and convincing evidence that the person spokefalsehoods with reckless disregard for whether they were trueor false. In most suits, this is an extremely difficultthreshold for plaintiffs.   More interesting is the question of whether Prof. Hillalso is a public figure -- and thus whether a suit by heragainst Judge Thomas would face similarly daunting odds.Prof. Hill has stressed that she didn't enter the public eyevoluntarily, generally one indication that someone shouldn'tbe treated as a public figure. On the other hand, shevoluntarily conducted a news conference and, in the course ofthe Senate hearings, became widely, if not universally, knownnationwide.   &quot;There's absolutely no question Anita Hill is a publicfigure,&quot; contends Prof. Rodney A. Smolla, a libel specialistat the College of William and Mary law school. &quot;She becomes apublic figure once she gives testimony and it becomes public,even through a leak.&quot;   What about the news media? They're likely to be protectedfrom libel suits in their coverage of any and all of theallegations, under broad constitutional and common-lawprivileges for reporting accurately on public proceedings andmatters of public debate.                                                                                                          Evidence                                                                                                          Trial lawyers are shaking their heads over the kinds ofevidence the Judiciary Committee solicited during the lastfew days.   &quot;A tremendous amount of opinion is being expressed whichwould be totally inadmissible in a trial unless someone wasan expert qualified to give&quot; it, says Richard D. Emery, apartner at the New York law firm Lankenau Kovner andamp; Bickford.   The big difference between the Senate committee hearingsand a trial, these lawyers say, is the admission of &quot;hearsay&quot;-- testimony usually not allowed at trial because it is beingasserted by someone who was not present at the events indispute.   Gerald B. Lefcourt, a white-collar criminal lawyer, saysthat &quot;somewhere near 95%&quot; of the testimony offered by JudgeThomas's colleagues at the Equal Employment OpportunityCommission would have been &quot;totally inadmissible&quot; in acourtroom. &quot;They were saying . . . he never did anything likethat to me. . . . That doesn't prove that he didn't do thaton another occasion, and its not admissible,&quot; says Mr.Lefcourt, who represented former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.trader Bruce Newberg in the Princeton/Newport case.   Mr. Lefcourt says the testimony by Judge Thomas'ssupporting witnesses that they believed Prof. Hill was lyingand their speculation about her motives certainly would havebeen barred by a judge, because they lacked personalknowledge. Mr. Emery says, however, that Mr. Thomas'ssupporting witnesses, who knew him well, would have beenpermitted to testify about his reputation.   Even though it was hearsay, the testimony of Prof. Hill'ssupporting witnesses concerning what Prof. Hill told themabout Judge Thomas might have been admitted in court. Mr.Lefcourt believes that testimony would have been ruled anexception to the hearsay rule, because &quot;the prior consistentstatements {were being used} to rebut an allegation of recentfabrication.&quot;   A tougher question for a judge, trial lawyers said, wouldbe whether evidence about Judge Thomas's personal behavior orpreferences was admissible. It was &quot;completely inconsistent .. . to rule out a whole portion of his life to scrutiny justas a matter of fiat and then let in a whole slew of hearsaydrivel, innuendo and inflammatory evidence,&quot; says Mr. Emery.   In a courtroom, Mr. Emery says, a judge might allow Mr.Thomas to be questioned outside the presence of a jury,before deciding whether the evidence should be admissible.   Ira L. Sorkin, a former regional administrator of theSecurities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutor,said a judge would only allow evidence about Judge Thomas'spersonal habits &quot;if it related to a specific course ofconduct or specific act that was very, very similar almost inkind to the type of conduct involved.&quot; He said a&quot;broad-ranging&quot; inquiry into the judge's habits would not bepermitted.                                                                                                          Perjury                                                                                                          Allegations or suggestions that perjury was committed bysomeone pervaded the hearings, as senators and witnessesrepeatedly pointed out that either Judge Thomas or Prof. Hillhad to be lying.   Witnesses can only be convicted of perjury if they arefound to have &quot;willfully made a false statement under oath ina proceeding,&quot; says Gary P. Naftalis of the New York law firmKramer, Levin, Nessen, Kamin andamp; Frankel. &quot;It has to bedeliberate, purposeful, knowing behavior.&quot;   There is no magic to proving perjury in a courtroom, saysMr. Sorkin: &quot;You prove that in the same way you prove otherthings&quot; -- by corroborating evidence with testimony anddocuments.   A perjury case would get really complicated, however, ifthe stated facts were proven to be false but the perjurydefendant maintained that he or she was convinced they weretrue. Mr. Naftalis suggests that such a case, which mightinvolve a defendant's delusions, probably would not result ina conviction. He says that any statement made as a result ofnegligence, carelessness, foolishness or a misperceptionwould not be considered to be a &quot;deliberate false statement.&quot;   But the final decision about whether testimony waswillfully false would be left up to a jury.                                                                                                          Polygraph Tests                                                                                                          In all federal and most state courts, a lie-detector testsuch as the one Prof. Hill voluntarily took last weekendwould not be admissible. But some states do allow polygraphtests to be admitted as evidence under certain conditions,usually when both sides agree they should be admitted.   Many trial lawyers and prosecutors view polygraph tests asa valuable investigative tool, even when the results cannotbe mentioned in a courtroom. &quot;Prosecutors {use polygraphswhen} exercising discretion about whether to believetestimony or whether to use witnesses,&quot; says Barry C. Scheck,a professor at Cardozo law school. &quot;Prosecutors will oftenresort to them to see which of two prospective witnesses aretelling the truth.&quot;   Adds Mr. Lefcourt, &quot;I use them a lot to try to convinceprosecutors not to proceed.&quot;   But most trial lawyers believe that polygraph tests arenot entirely reliable, and that their results depend upon theoperator and the attitudes and outlook of the person beingtested.   &quot;I'm very wary of them. I've seen them used, and I'mconvinced that people who are pathological liars orconsummate con men can pass the test,&quot; said Mr. Sorkin. &quot;I'malso reasonably convinced that people can convince themselvesof the truth. There are people who can convince themselvesthat they actually saw flying saucers and green men.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
