Those folks who ran you out of elevators, airplanes and evenyour own office are at it again. From the White House to city hall, smokersare becoming an endangered species. The only friends you have left, itappears, are in the state Legislature, where protecting smokers' rights isstill a popular cause.;    Only about 20 percent of adult Californians smoke,down from 28 percent in 1982. One reason for the decline is thattobacco-related disease kills 40,000 people in the state each year. Anotherreason is cost: Since the cigarette tax went to 35 cents a pack in 1989,tobacco consumption has dropped 14 percent.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SMOKERS' LAST STANDTOBACCO COMPANIES AND SMOKERS STILL HAVEFRIENDS IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO><TEXT>     Also important is the steady pressure at all levels of government toprotect non-smokers from breathing harmful smoke-filled air and educatepotential smokers about the dangers of the habit. Louis Sullivan, secretary ofHealth and Human Services, is trying to ban smoking in all federal buildingsand even has persuaded the Pentagon to wage war on smoking.;    On the locallevel, cities from San Luis Obispo to Walnut Creek are passing tough smokingbans. In Santa Clara County, where only 19 percent of adults smoke and everycity limits smoking in some way, Palo Alto and Los Gatos are consideringbanning smoking in restaurants and nearly all public buildings.;    Yet inSacramento, the atmosphere is quite different. In the past year, legislatorshave voted down a ban on cigarette machines, stiffer penalties for sellingtobacco to minors and a law allowing tobacco use to be listed as acontributing cause on death certificates.;    Wednesday a state Senatecommittee failed to pass a sweeping bill from Dan Boatwright, D-Concord, whichwould have banned smoking nearly everywhere except in private homes. Earlierthis week a more modest bill from Assemblywoman Jackie Speier, D-South SanFrancisco, died in committee.;    Why is the Legislature so concerned with therights of the 4 million Californians who smoke instead of the 25 million whodon't? Perhaps it has to do with millions of dollars in lobbying efforts.Tobacco interests are among the top five sources of campaign money in stateraces and buy plenty of gifts and fancy dinners for legislators.;    In themeantime, the grass-roots campaign to make tobacco use ancient history goes onthroughout California. In Santa Clara County, the Tobacco Control Coalition isrunning an extensive education campaign with proceeds from the Proposition 99cigarette tax, aimed at pregnant women, teen-agers and others at high risk fortobacco use. The goal is to reduce tobacco consumption in the county 75percent by 1999.;    Perhaps by then the Legislature will have gotten themessage.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910503  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  446  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday May 3, 199100124152,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
