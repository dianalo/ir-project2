The answer is clear: Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.It's impossible to determine whether every move that led tothe shootings on Sunday was precisely intended by Mr.Gorbachev, and it is believable from his past behavior thathe didn't set out to spill blood. But the outcome wasconsistent with his unwavering policy of blockingindependence movements that threaten to undo the SovietUnion.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Gorbachev is the ally of the military, he is with them,&quot;says Igor Chubais, a radical democratic leader in Moscow.   Mr. Gorbachev has taken different tacks at times,alternating carrot with stick, but his objective has neverchanged. That consistent goal is rooted in his belief in theneed to preserve a unified Soviet Union and &quot;socialistchoice.&quot; Even in the economic sphere, where he repeatedlyasserts his commitment to &quot;the market,&quot; Mr. Gorbachevinterprets that goal as a new way of legitimizing the 1917revolution.   Westerners who have invested trust in Mr. Gorbachev forhis role in lifting the Iron Curtain tend not to listencarefully to what he says, some of his Soviet critics say. Inpart this is because when he speaks conservatively, his aidesexplain that he is trying to appease hard-liners.   But a look at his words and deeds in the 10 months sinceLithuania declared independence shows that he should be takenprecisely at his word.   And, the actions in Lithuania indicate that he may havereached the point at which he is willing to openly abandontalk of moving toward democracy as well as many of theprinciples of perestroika in exchange for keepingindependence movements in check.   In elections early last year, Lithuania's formergovernment was soundly routed by anti-Communist candidates.On March 11, newly elected Lithuanian representatives passeda declaration of independence, making the Soviet constitutioninvalid on Lithuanian territory.   &quot;In essence it all started in March . . . there was anighttime constitutional coup d'etat,&quot; Mr. Gorbachev toldParliament Monday. The March decrees &quot;are anti-constitutionaland illegal and should be abolished,&quot; he told reporters.   Lithuania's declaration was followed by similar decrees byits Baltic neighbors, Latvia and Estonia. The Kremlin hasalways feared that if Lithuania were allowed to leave theunion, it would open the door for others. A month after theelections in Lithuania brought nationalists to power, Moscowimposed an economic blockade to force Lithuania to back down.   May's election victory by Russian Republic leader BorisYeltsin forced a realignment of political forces in thecountry and seemed to spark a period of rapprochement betweenLithuania and the Kremlin. Mr. Yeltsin picked up the Baltictheme of sovereignty. He opposed the economic blockade,strengthening the Baltic states' cause and giving them apowerful ally. Within a month, Russia, the nation's largestrepublic, had declared sovereignty as well. A month later, anuneasy truce was reached between the Kremlin and Lithuania,and during the summer they tried to start negotiating.   But when the snow started falling in December, Mr.Gorbachev began issuing presidential decrees to provide abasis for overthrowing a democratically elected government.One said that the military could step in to protect CommunistParty property and another said it could act to protectmonuments to Lenin and other Communist heroes. One that waslargely overlooked at the time demanded that republics complywith the draft and allowed the military to use force toenforce it.   These decrees provide the basis for last week's warningthat the military would round up draft evaders in sevenrepublics -- the first premise for the crackdown in Lithuania-- and enabled the military to take over key buildings inVilnius in attacks that have left 14 dead so far.   In Parliament Tuesday, Mr. Gorbachev lashed out at Mr.Yeltsin, his most powerful rival, for his latest move --advocating the creation of a Russian Republican army. Sincethe crackdown, Mr. Yeltsin has been actively buildingsolidarity with the Baltics and other republics.   In a heated speech in the Parliament, which he punctuatedby pounding his fist on the podium, Mr. Gorbachev called theplan for a Russian army &quot;a gross violation of the Sovietconstitution.&quot; He shouted, &quot;I condemn this as a politicalprovocation that is conducive to clashes of opinion andconfrontation rather than consolidation of society. This mustbe rejected and denounced.&quot;   In September, Messrs. Gorbachev and Yeltsin had seemed onthe verge of an alliance to promote radical economic reform.But in October, Mr. Gorbachev threw his support behind a moreconservative plan. Meanwhile, the draft union treaty heoffered last month only vaguely defined new republican powerswhile eliminating the right to secede from the union, whichexists in the previous treaty dating from 1922.   Political analysts say Mr. Gorbachev's reversal in Octoberrevealed that he is firmly beholden to themilitary-industrial complex and the Communist Party, of whichhe is still general-secretary and through which he attainedhis present power. But a senior member of the economic teamthat came up with the watered-down plan says the president&quot;simply realized that what Mr. Yeltsin was really after wasto take over power.&quot;   Once he had decided that he wouldn't share power with Mr.Yeltsin, Mr. Gorbachev started calling for greaterpresidential might, his only way to carry out his policies.Without the support of Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Gorbachev was forcedto turn to the powerful army, security and partyorganizations for support. Since then, political analystsspeculate, his reliance on the army has made him its captive.   But some observers in Lithuania and Moscow say that if Mr.Gorbachev was powerless to stop the crackdown in Vilnius, hecould at least have spoken out about it quickly. Instead hemade his first remarks to reporters on the Parliament stepsMonday, a day later. And, critics say, if hardline forceswere really in charge in the Kremlin, censorship immediatelywould have been airtight, which it was not. In any event,critics say, the result is the same for the republics.   &quot;His only will is to preserve his power at any price,&quot; aSoviet journalist says bitterly. &quot;Now I understand that hisown power is much dearer to him even than friendship withBush and the West.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
