TRH or DN 1417 (10 mg/kgper day intraperitoneally) were administered to male Wistar rats forten days. At twenty four hr after the last injection, tissue slices ofthe midbrain raphe were prepared and the rate of serotonin biosynthesiswas estimated by measuring formation of 5-hydroxtryptophan (5-HTP) fromtryptophan during inhibition of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase usinghigh-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Totalbiopterin content was determined by a specific radioimmunoassay. 5-HTPformation was decreased 22% and 29%, and total biopterin content 69%and 72%, in TRH- and DN 1417 treated rats, respectively. However, tryptophanconcentration in raphe slices did not change. In contrast, the V/submax/ of tryptophan hydroxylase in the homogenate of the raphe nucleusin the presence of a saturating concentration of (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin,the naturally occurring pterin cofactor, was significantly increasedafter repeated administration of TRH or DN 1417. 18 references, 1 figure,2 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
