High-school kids are wearing bobby socks again. Family shows are the rage on television. Detroit is selling &quot;muscle&quot; cars. And another baby boom is under way.    Yet despite appearances, the halcyon days of the American middle class aren't staging a comeback. Although many people still identify with the middle class -- 92% of the respondents to a recent survey said they consider themselves among its members -- the once-tightly knit group has broken apart.    The change is most evident, and most frequently documented, in economic terms. By any measure, the share of households with middle-class incomes has steadily declined. A turbulent economy has also fractured any sense of common progress.    But middle class represents a way of life as much as a certain-sized pocketbook. Though never quite the idyllic family symbolized by Ozzie and Harriet, it nevertheless was marked by a broad consensus on how to live and what constitutes success. That consensus has given way to an increasingly fragmented array of life styles and values.    Today, the middle class is a single mother with two children -- as well as an unmarried couple who don't want children. The middle class can still mean keeping up with the Joneses -- but it can also can mean the pursuit of &quot;experiences,&quot; from fly fishing to exotic, adventure-oriented vacations. The middle class can mean pursuing a successful career or moving to the country or championing a cause. None of those life styles or activities are new; what's new are the greater numbers of people who now take part in all of them.    &quot;It's become much more difficult to think of the middle class as some big monolithic group of people,&quot; says Susan Gianinno, director of research services at the advertising agency Young andamp; Rubicam. Adds Gary Truit, vice president of international marketing at Adolph Coors Co., the brewer: &quot;Society is demassifying.&quot;    The implications of an increasingly fragmented middle class are numerous: Among neighborhoods, there is a vanishing sense of community; among families, parents find fewer agreed-on guideposts for raising their children; and among businesses, companies have had to learn how to cope with an eroding mass market.    Sociologists and others attribute the changes in the middle class to such forces as the aging of the baby-boom generation -- with its anti-conformist values -- and the increased freedoms afforded by an affluent society. As people are less driven by basic wants, they are more likely to follow different paths, social theorists say.    &quot;What we've been seeing is the de-socialization of the middle class,&quot; says David Riesman, a Harvard sociologist. &quot;Society hasn't seen the need to impose as much of a common mold on people as it once did. There's much more tolerance.&quot;    In short, there is no longer one set of values that broadly fits the bulk of the middle class; there are fewer things that everybody wants. And there are fewer things that everybody feels compelled to do. The notions of self-sacrifice and loyalty that George Bernard Shaw alluded to in his definition of &quot;middle-class morality&quot; -- &quot;I have to live for others and not for myself&quot; -- have largely given way to middle-class independence. People are more likely to face what Tom Wolfe calls the &quot;problem of overchoice.&quot;    And so, for example, few companies today would spend their ad dollars -- as Metropolitan Life once did -- promoting the idea that their customers include 400,000 Smiths. Instead, advertisers are more likely to emphasize qualities of &quot;rare character&quot; (Jandamp;B Scotch), or contend that &quot;We've got your style&quot; (Gillette) -- whatever your style might be. Even oatmeal cookies are being sold in packs for one.    Similarly, SRI International, a Menlo Park, Calif., research company, says it has seen a sharp reduction in what the company calls &quot;Belongers&quot; -- its classification for the traditional middle-class American. Belongers tend to be family-oriented and religious. They usually answer &quot;yes&quot; to the question: Do you prefer an evening at home with the family to a night out with friends? Now about 38% of the population by SRI's definition, Belongers accounted for as much as 60% two decades ago.    &quot;The Belongers not only dominated the middle class but they tend to be very conformist,&quot; says Jay Ogilvy, a vice president at SRI. &quot;It's a major reason why the middle class once seemed so homogenous.&quot;    Today, according to the company's research staff, the middle class is dominated by a greater number of groups, including &quot;Achievers,&quot; &quot;Experientials,&quot; and the &quot;Societally-Conscious.&quot; Moreover, the categories that are growing the fastest tend to include more individualists.    Demographic changes also suggest some reasons why the social epoxy has come apart. A report last year by the Congressional Research Service contended that the &quot;strongest erosive effect on the middle class&quot; is a divorce rate that gives a child born today a 60% chance of being raised through at least one separation -- and a 20% possibility of going through two. And while most families (81% in 1962) once wanted three or more children, there is now no overwhelming majority that agrees on how many children -- if any -- to have.    More examples of reduced unanimity in life styles and values: Participation sports of all kinds are on the rise; the number of people taking out passports for personal reasons has risen to more than two million annually from only 673,000 in 1960; the Roper poll recently found that the number of people who value having a lawn and a yard has dropped to 52% of the population from 62% in 1976; so-called life-style enclaves have sprung up around the country where people who share interests live together -- a retirement village, a yuppie neighborhood in a big city or a community of pilots who build homes around a shared airstrip.    Some sociologists now contend that middle-class values will splinter even further. Among other things, they believe that changes in the mass media -- as seen in the proliferation of cable-TV shows and specialty magazines -- is helping to undo the cohesiveness that national magazines and network television engendered. &quot;It was mass communication in the first place that helped create some of the commonalities of the middle class,&quot; says Susan Hayward, a vice president at Yankelovich Clancy Shulman, a research firm. &quot;But now the media is going in the opposite direction. There are more options every day.&quot;    It is possible to argue that America will always be a predominantly middle-class society. Under a more classic definition, middle class refers to a section of society that is self-reliant. The poor are those who can't support themselves, and the rich are those who don't have to.    But middle class has come to mean considerably more than that to most people. And the ethos may never be as strong as it once was. Says Ms. Hayward of Yankelovich Clancy, &quot;People are more in a position of making their lives up as they go along.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
