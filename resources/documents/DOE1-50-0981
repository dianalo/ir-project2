The effects of fiberfine structure, moisture content, and temperature on SO{sub 2} sorptionwere examined as well. An exposure chamber was developed which wouldsimulate ambient conditions. Fiber samples were dried or conditionedto 69 +/- 1% RH and exposed to 3 ppm SO{sub 2} for 5 hours at 170 cc/min.Following exposure to SO{sub 2} the samples were exposed to a streamof dry air at the same flow rate for 4 hours. The concentration of gasexiting the chamber was monitored and compared with the known concentrationof gas introduced into the chamber to evaluate the amount of gas sorbed.</TEXT></DOC>
