Disagreement at the negotiations, which began in March 1985,centers on U.S. plans for a space-based missile defense and Sovietinsistence on limiting sea-launched cruise missiles. Manyanti-cheating provisions also remain open in a draft agreement ofmore than 300 pages.   U.S. and Soviet teams held a two-hour plenary meeting at theU.S. mission to launch the 10th round of talks, for which no endhas been set. The talks had recessed for the Moscow summit.   A source close to the talks who demanded anonymity called theinitial two-hour session ``productive'' but declined to say if newproposals were made. ``Some interesting things were said,'' thesource said, refusing to elaborate.   Before the opening session, chief U.S. negotiator Max Kampelmanreaffirmed Washington's stand that the draft pact halving eachside's strategic stockpile ``should not be held hostage'' to limitssought by Moscow on President Reagan's missile defense program, theStrategic Defense Initiative.   Asked whether a possible fifth superpower summit or the end ofReagan's presidency in January could be target dates for agreement,Kampelman said talks will ``continue no matter who is president andno matter who the leader of the Soviet Union is.''   ``I don't think important issues should be governed by thecalendar,'' he told reporters before the opening session. ``If ittakes longer fine, if it takes shorter fine.''   Kampelman said on Monday that an agreement was still possibleunder the Reagan administration. He and his top two aides were tobrief NATO allies on Wednesday in Brussels on the start of thetalks. The negotiations are to continue Wednesday or Thursday, theU.S. side said.   At the May 29-June 2 summit in Moscow, Reagan and GeneralSecretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev ordered negotiators to continue``energetically and purposefully'' after the two leaders made onlylimited progress on arms control.   Kampelman told reporters Monday: ``Don't look for drama. We'reat a stage now where hard work is required rather than drama.''   Soviet chief delegate Alexei Obukhov said on Sunday the talksmust not lose momentum.   Both said the talks have come ``a long way'' but Kampelman notedmuch still remains to be resolved.   Washington and Moscow agree the proposed Strategic ArmsReduction Treaty should cut each side's stocks over seven years toan overall limit of 6,000 nuclear warheads and 1,600 launchers,such as heavy bombers and land-based intercontinental missiles.   Some details of monitoring compliance are also set.   But Obukhov said progress was imperative on a renewedU.S.-Soviet commitment to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,which Moscow says is threatened by Strategic Defense Initiative,also known as SDI.   Reagan says SDI does not violate the ABM pact, and Kampelmanreaffirmed the U.S. side will not allow Moscow ``to use thesenegotiations to have us end our Strategic Defense Initiative.''   The Geneva negotiators have yet to agree on a joint textpledging each side to observe the ABM treaty for a certain period.   Obukhov also pressed for limits on long-range, sea-launchedcruise missiles and verification measures including inspections ofwarships.   Washington has balked, saying the weapons cannot be reliablydetected. U.S. START negotiator Steven Hanmer called Sovietverification proposals ``totally impractical'' and said currentprospects for resolving the issue are dim.</TEXT></DOC>
