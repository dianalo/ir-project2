Issues affecting thousands of creditors are routinely handled by such lawyers, called receivers, appointed by district courts where the SEC brings its enforcement actions. But the issues are better suited for the bankruptcy court system set up for such matters, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals said. SEC officials indicated they would take note of the court's concern.    The criticism came in an appeals ruling affirming various SEC court actions against a securities and commodities firm currently being liquidated, American Board of Trade Inc., New York.    Although district courts have the power to name receivers in SEC actions, a receivership &quot;should not be used to effect the liquidation of defendants in actions brought under the securities laws,&quot; the appeals panel said. The court said it's concerned that the receivers and the district courts too often assume sweeping liquidation responsibilities that a bankruptcy court is better suited to handle fairly.    The appeals court would prefer that the SEC would back transferring to bankruptcy court cases involving companies that must be liquidated. However, the SEC claims that it often doesn't need full-blown bankruptcy proceedings, but instead prefers quickly liquidating a company that is found to be insolvent.    Attorney Milton S. Gould, appointed last year as American Board of Trade's receiver, recommended liquidation after finding that the company owed holders of its unregistered commercial paper $79 million but had only $30 million of assets.    Mr. Gould's appointment resulted from an SEC lawsuit charging that the company was offering holders of the paper interest rates higher than it could pay, and covering the shortage with even larger sales of new notes, in what is commonly labeled a Ponzi scheme. The company denied the charges.    The appeals panel agreed that various actions against American Board of Trade, including a district judge's appointment of Mr. Gould to guard its assets, were warranted.    But the panel said it was &quot;disturbed&quot; that the district court -- in later doing such things as processing proof-of-claim forms from thousands of note holders, setting priorities among classes of creditors and selling property -- &quot;essentially transformed itself into a court of bankruptcy aided by a receiver performing the tasks of a bankruptcy trustee.&quot;    In a 32-page opinion, U.S. Circuit Judge Ralph K. Winter noted that the liquidation was performed &quot;without the aid of either the experience of a bankruptcy judge or the guidance of the Bankruptcy Code.&quot; The appeals court added that the time-consuming chores shouldered by U.S. District Judge Shirley Wohl Kram and Mr. Gould &quot;demonstrate the wisdom of not using a receivership as a substitute for bankruptcy.&quot;    The court has criticized similar uses of receivers in other SEC cases, but its criticisms were always moot because liquidations were already under way. It's also too late to change the American Board of Trade liquidation, but the appeals judges said they &quot;expect&quot; the SEC, as part of its &quot;professional responsibility,&quot; to bring their views to the attention of district judges in future cases.    In Washington, Eric Summergrad, an SEC assistant general counsel who argued the appeal, said the agency will consider the appeals court's views. &quot;I don't think the court is saying liquidation must always proceed in bankruptcy. (But) the court certainly has in this and other cases expressed a strong preference.&quot; He added that &quot;things had progressed so far in (district) court&quot; in the American Board of Trade matter that a receiver was appropriate.    Arthur N. Economou, American Board of Trade president, said the court's criticism of the liquidation was a minor victory in an otherwise &quot;extremely distorted&quot; opinion that he plans to appeal to the Supreme Court. </TEXT></DOC>
