<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-76-0488 </DOCNO><TEXT>A simple and low cost energy efficient pre-fabricated housing system hasbeen developed using precoated galvanized multi-panel with expanded polystyrene(EPS) foam core and with built-in back flow vertical thermosiphoningair panel (TAP) as a passive solar collector. A slightly modified mock-upexperimental house was constructed for comparative analysis of the thermalperformance based on the results of theoretical computer simulation withactually measured data during the heating season. The effectiveness ofthe system house in terms of energy economy and fine tuning design developmentis discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
