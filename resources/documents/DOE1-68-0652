<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-68-0652 </DOCNO><TEXT>The electrochemical reactions in a pyrosulfate melt have been studied.The experimental work focused on testing possible electrolytes for usein a flue-gas desulfurization cell operating at a much lower temperaturethan was previously possible. In a two-compartment gas-tight cell, theanalysis of the cathode effluent stream provided vital information onthe reactions taking place. In pure potassium pyrosulfate, no removalof SO{sub 2} with applied current took place. Rather, SO{sub 2} was produced,eliminating pure K{sub 2}S{sub 2}O{sub 7} as a candidate electrolyte.However, in 1% V{sub 2}O{sub 5} - 99% K{sub 2}S{sub 2}O{sub 7} cathodicSO{sub 2} removal increased with current until the process was limitedby the rate of SO{sub 2} transfer from the flue gas bubbles. Additionof SO{sub 4}{sup 2-} further enhances the SO{sub 2} removal rate andfuture work will involve S{sub 2}O{sub 7}{sup 2-}/SO{sub 4}{sup 2-}/V{sub2}O{sub 5} combinations. A cathodic reaction scheme consistent with ourresults and those of other workers has been presented.</TEXT></DOC>
