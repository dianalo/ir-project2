The 1986 tax act forces millions of dependent kids with unearned income -- interest and dividends, mainly -- to file returns if total income tops $500; unearned income over $1,000 of a child under 14 is taxed at the parent's top rate. But starting with 1989 returns, the new tax bill eases procedures by letting parents elect to include a child under 14 on the parental return. The child must have income of $500 to $5,000 -- and only from interest and dividends.    The child mustn't pay estimated taxes separately or be subject to the 20% backup withholding tax for not reporting a correct Social Security number. On these terms, the parent can take into parental income the child's gross income over $1,000. For the child's income of between $500 and $1,000, the parent pays an added tax of the lesser of $75 or 15% of the amount over $500.    Certain income of the child from private-activity bonds becomes a tax preference for determining the parent's alternative minimum tax.    SURVIVORS and the disabled get tax-bill breaks on sales of their homes.    A married couple filing jointly who sell their principal home for a profit can defer tax on it by reinvesting the gain in another home within two years. Yet old law bars that deferral if one spouse dies after the old home is sold and before the new one is purchased. The tax bill awaiting President Reagan's signature extends the deferral to surviving spouses, retroactively for home sales made after 1984.    Another section aids people over 55 who seek a one-time $125,000 exemption for gain on selling a home. The place must have been used as the main home for at least three of the five prior years. The tax bill provides that this use requirement is met if the seller uses the home for at least one year but during any of the rest of the five years becomes incapable of self-care and is forced to live in a nursing home.    CO-OPS CONVERTING to condominiums can escape a tax on assets.    Many apartment cooperatives that want to adopt condominium status have been waiting for a technical correction in their favor. The problem: They could be taxed as corporations on any gain in value of the assets disbursed to tenant-owners, even if the transaction were just a way to change the form of ownership. Now the tax bill provides a solution -- as long as conversion involves the owners' principal residences.    The bill says that no gain or loss will be recognized by a co-op that distributes its units to tenant-owners in exchange for their stock, on certain conditions. The owners must use the units as their main homes both before and after the exchange and must qualify generally for the rollover of gain on the sale of one home into the purchase of another. There is a catch, Alan Hollander, a Boston lawyer, notes:   An owner must wait two years after conversion to sell the unit and roll over a gain into another home.    UNDERPAYMENTS of estimated taxes caused by retroactive technical corrections won't be penalized. The tax bill gives individuals until April 15 and corporations until March 15 to pay taxes in full without penalty for such shortfalls.    SISS-BOOM-BAH! Old law bars charitable deductions for gifts to colleges that entitle you to buy preferred sports tickets. But the tax bill allows an 80% deduction for such gifts, if you buy tickets separately, retroactive to 1984.    TRAINED DOGS that aid the blind and the deaf could be deducted as a medical expense under old law. The tax bill creates an itemized medical deduction for dogs and other animals used to aid individuals with any type of physical disability.    THE IRS CAN TRADE return information with cities with populations exceeding 250,000, under the tax bill. Old law limited such IRS exchange agreements to cities with at least two million residents.    INCENTIVE OPTIONS get tricky minimum-tax treatment in the tax bill.    Without low capital-gains tax rates, there's no reason to hold incentive-option stock for a year after exercise to qualify for capital-gains treatment. And until now, an early disqualifying sale in the calendar year after exercise erased the threat of the alternative minimum tax, which must be paid if it exceeds tax figured the regular way. The bill changes that -- with an unexpected twist for some option-stock holders. Starting last Jan. 1, exercising options below market creates an immediate discount tax break, or preference, subject to minimum tax, unless the stock is sold in the same year.    Options exercised in 1987 don't cause a preference if there is an early disqualifying sale of the stock in 1988. That opens an opportunity for people who exercised options in November and December 1987 and who -- because of terms in a prior bill draft -- paid minimum tax for 1987. They now have a chance to make a disqualifying sale of the stock in 1988 before the end of the one-year holding period, notes Robert Coplan of Ernst andamp; Whinney, CPAs.    If they do, they can wipe out the 1987 preference and get a refund of the 1987 minimum tax.    TAX-BILL BRIEFS: After 1988, parents no longer may take a dependency exemption for a child 24 or older who is a full-time student and has income exceeding the exemption ($2,000 in 1989). . . . The maximum penalty for giving the IRS a bad check in bad faith is doubled to 2% of the check. </TEXT></DOC>
