Hutton with the relative ease of a python swallowing a bird.    Money managers and traders say there hasn't been any interruption in their daily calls from Shearson's institutional equity salesmen since the Dec. 2 merger accord. Even Shearson's absorption of much of Hutton's research team is proceeding without apparent glitches, they add.    &quot;They've done a phenomenal job of consolidating the two operations,&quot; says William Harnisch, president of Forstmann-Leff Associates. &quot;It's almost like Hutton never existed.&quot; Mr. Harnisch's money management firm in recent years has been a big client of Shearson and Hutton.    Within two fateful weeks in December, Shearson interviewed thousands of Hutton employees. It absorbed Hutton's retail sales force and cherry-picked most other units. Survivors from Hutton's capital markets group already have moved from their pink marble midtown New York quarters to Shearson's white downtown tower.    A Shearson data-processing employee assigned to Hutton's capital markets group in December says stacks of personnel files labeled &quot;C,&quot; indicating individuals had been fired, towered over the rest. The &quot;A&quot; files designated people who had been hired; &quot;B&quot; was for those only temporarily retained.    Only five of Hutton's 60 institutional equity traders and sales people were hired.    Louis Lloyd, a senior executive in Shearson's capital markets group, says there just wasn't room for many Hutton people on Shearson's big equity desk. Two Hutton traders, Frank Kelly and Tom Wallace, were hired for their valuable knowledge of food and financial stocks, he says. It was hard to pass over people who had &quot;given years of their lives to Hutton,&quot; Mr. Lloyd adds.    Shearson, measured by yearly institutional stock-trading commissions, ranks among the top five Wall Street firms. Hutton ranked about 10th, traders say.    Despite rumors of big losses at Hutton's equity desk, Thomas Stiles, former head of Hutton's research, trading and sales units, notes Hutton has said publicly that the hit from all stock and bond trading in October was &quot;less than $10 million.&quot; A former Hutton trader says the institutional equity desk in October had about a $12 million loss. But &quot;we were up $6 million (for 1987) going into October,&quot; he adds.    Few Huttonites rejected Shearson's job offers. The penalty for doing so, warned a December memo from Hutton's human resources department: Forfeiture of year-end bonuses and severance payments. Shearson had a hand in the memo, a Shearson spokesman concedes.    For some at Hutton, there were carrots as well as sticks. One relatively senior recruit's 1987 bonus from Shearson was about four times his $120,000 base pay. That was maybe twice the sum he might have received from Hutton, he says.    Mr. Stiles says Shearson executives &quot;tried to do as rapid and painless a job of evaluating people&quot; as they could, although some good Hutton people may have been overlooked. Mr. Stiles's own plans are &quot;indeterminate&quot; but include &quot;opportunities within Shearson,&quot; he says. The speculation is that he might join Hutton's money management unit, which Shearson kept relatively intact.    As expected, Shearson hired few Hutton capital markets executives. Besides wanting to avoid overlaps, it may have learned from its 1984 Lehman Brothers acquisition that it's hard to assimilate executives and traders with a different corporate culture, industry executives say.    Hutton's research unit fared better than its traders. About 29 of roughly 60 Hutton analysts and economists were hired, while a dozen Shearson stock analysts were ousted to make room. The shakeup was part of a 10-month strengthening of Shearson research, says Jack Rivkin, the firm's research director since February.    It was big news recently when Hutton's economics team under Robert Barbera displaced Shearson's team under high-profile Allen Sinai. But Shearson also has substituted Hutton technical and growth-stock analysts for its own, while recruiting Hutton's political analysts to fill a gap.    Most Hutton securities analysts hired were runners-up on Institutional Investor magazine's All-America Research Team, including Gary Reich and Terence Quinn, respectively aerospace and technology analysts. In 1987, Hutton had more All-America analysts than Shearson.    Hiring rising analyst stars who don't yet command top compensation is considered smart. If they don't attract commission dollars, they won't last at Shearson, predicts an industry executive.    Some people believe Shearson leaned too heavily on analyst rankings. &quot;We were upset&quot; by the departures of Michael Gardner and Thomas Galvin, Shearson's former aerospace and technology analysts, says one investor. He says he has stopped directing commissions to Shearson and is &quot;evaluating the changes&quot; at the research unit.    Mr. Rivkin says his goal was &quot;to put in the best people.&quot; Hutton's Mr. Stiles, a colleague since their Harvard Business School days in the 1960s, offered &quot;helpful&quot; advice, he adds.    Some things don't change, says a Hutton survivor: When the market is rocky, &quot;it hurts at Hutton, it hurts at Shearson.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
