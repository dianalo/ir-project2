T. Kearney. Kearneyprovided transportation rate ranges for an initial sample of 89 plantsand the analysis of how some transportation rate factors (e.g., railroadmergers, carrier cost and pricing) would not significantly change toaffect rates over the next 10 years. EVA developed the remaining transportationrates and the analysis of transportation rate differentials created bycoal switching. Transportation costs are the most significant factorin determining within a utility system the order in which the stationswould switch to low-sulfur coal. This is because FOB mine prices forlow-sulfur coal should be approximately the same for stations withina given utility system, but the delivered costs will vary significantlybased upon the station's locations, mode of delivery and carrier involved.The same is true for high-sulfur coal. High-sulfur FOB mine prices areusually comparable for a given utility system, and the transportationcosts will determine the ranking of high-sulfur coals. With a relativelyfixed FOB mine price differential between high and low-sulfur coals,it will be the transportation cost differential that will show the greatestvariation within a specific utility system. The greater this transportationdifferential, the greater the costs of switching to a low-sulfur coal.</TEXT></DOC>
