The Food and Drug Administration is expected to ask General Mills Inc., and perhaps Kellogg Co. as well, to prove that the amounts of an esoteric Asian grain they're putting in new high-fiber cereals are safe to eat -- even though millions of Americans consume the ingredient daily in laxatives.    A letter is being drafted by the FDA asking General Mills to prove that the husks of psyllium seeds in its new Benefit cereal present no long-term health risk, people familiar with the case said. Just this week Kellogg also introduced a cereal with the husks -- and is testing another -- meaning it is also likely to get a letter.    There is no indication that the FDA believes psyllium represents a potential health hazard. In fact, psyllium is the primary ingredient in such popular laxatives as Metamucil and Fiberall.    But as yet the agency hasn't determined what it considers a safe level of psyllium in cereals. Right now, the only FDA standard for psyllium in food allows one-half of 1%, by weight, in ice creams and other frozen desserts.    A spokeswoman for Minneapolis-based General Mills said yesterday that while the company has no knowledge of the FDA's position, &quot;We will cooperate with them with whatever information they are requesting.&quot;    The FDA wouldn't comment on its intentions, but a spokesman said that it often notifies companies when they &quot;put something into food that the FDA doesn't consider to be generally accepted as safe.&quot; The company can respond with supporting data, file a formal petition for a safety ruling or ignore the request, he said. As a last resort, the agency can go to court and seek authority to seize a product. Before it introduced Benefit in April, General Mills funded a University of Minnesota study that found psyllium apparently helped to reduce blood cholesterol.    In seeking verification that psyllium is safe in cereals, the FDA may ask for other research, however. While numerous studies have focused on soluble fiber's effect on cholesterol, little has been done on the long-term effect of eating psyllium.    The use of psyllium poses another issue for the FDA: Should it permit the grain's reputed cholesterol-lowering property to be touted in advertisements for products?    Procter andamp; Gamble Co., which is the largest U.S. user of psyllium husks, raised that question soon after General Mills rolled out Benefit. Psyllium is a major ingredient in Pandamp;G's Metamucil laxative, but so far the FDA has refused to approve a Pandamp;G request to advertise the grain's cholesterol-lowering property.    In rejecting Pandamp;G's request, the FDA said: &quot;From a safety point of view, the effects of long-term treatment with psyllium hydrophilic mucciloid on . . . metabolism of minerals and fat-soluble vitamins have not been clearly determined.&quot;    Pandamp;G has submitted several studies -- including one done by the same researchers as those on the Benefit study -- showing that psyllium can reduce blood cholesterol. Larry Bell, who worked on one such study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in June, concluded that &quot;for many people with elevated cholesterol levels, daily doses of psyllium combined with the proper diet may be all the therapy they need to control their high cholesterol.&quot;    In protesting General Mills's claims for psyllium, Pandamp;G pointed out to the FDA that boxes of Benefit advise consumers to &quot;start with one-half serving of Benefit and gradually increase to a full serving.&quot; Moreover, Pandamp;G said, consumers are directed to &quot;consult a doctor and avoid laxatives&quot; if use of the cereal results in &quot;digestive discomfort.&quot;    In a letter to the FDA in June, Pandamp;G said that a review of Benefit and its promotional materials &quot;reinforce the conclusion that the product is a drug pretending to be a food.&quot;    There was no indication as to when the FDA might rule on Pandamp;G's contention. The matter of timing is clouded because one arm of the agency deals with food issues while another is responsible for drugs.    Before introducing Benefit, General Mills notified the FDA that the product would contain psyllium, the company said yesterday. The spokeswoman also noted that the company had researched psyllium before including it in Benefit and had concluded &quot;psyllium is a common grain that's been in use with consumers across the country for at least 30 years.&quot;    A spokesman for Kellogg, which introduced its Heartwise cereal earlier this week, yesterday also defended the grain's use. &quot;We feel very comfortable,&quot; he said. &quot;We've done our homework and we consider psyllium GRAS.&quot; GRAS is an acronym for Generally Recognized as Safe, an FDA standard for food ingredients.    India, the world's primary source of psyllium, recently raised the price of husks to $3 a kilo from about $2.20 a kilo, a move that grain brokers say effectively halted imports into the U.S. But Pandamp;G and other large users are believed to have several months' supply of psyllium stockpiled. </TEXT></DOC>
