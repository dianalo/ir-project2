The existingTS limit is 3.30 weight percent.The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application foramendment dated April 11, 1988, as supplemented by letters dated December16, 1988 and January 26, 1989.The Need for the Proposed ActionThe proposed change to the TS is required in order to provide the licenseewith the capability to store fuel with a slightly higher initial enrichmentof Uranium-235 for future use in the reactor and to store the spent fuelwhen it is discharged from the reactor. The use of this fuel in the reactoris not part of this proposed action.Environmental Impacts of the Proposed ActionThe Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision toTS and concludes that there is no change to the operations or equipmentassociated with the handling of new or spent fuel; there is no change tothe size, shape, or weight of new or spent fuel assemblies; there is noassociated change in fission product inventory in spent fuel assemblies;and there is no change in plant effluents associated with this action.Therefore, the proposed changes do not increase the probability of consequencesof any accident or malfunction of equipment important to safety, no changesare being made in the types of any effluents that may be released offsite,and there is no increase in the allowable individual or cumulative occupationalexposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed actionwould result in no significant radiological environmental impact.The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forPrior Hearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on May 26, 1988 (53 FR 19071). No request forhearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice.With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed change tothe TS involves no change to the existing operations or needed resources.It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmentalimpact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significantnonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment.Alternatives to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would resultin reduced operational flexibility.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statement for the Davis-Besse Nuclear PowerStation, Unit 1, dated March 1973 and its supplement dated October 1975.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult otheragencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated April 11, 1988 as supplemented December 16, 1988 and January26, 1989, which are available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC and at the Universityof Toledo Library, Documents Department, 2801 Bancroft Avenue, Toledo,Ohio 43606.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 5th day of April 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Thomas V.
