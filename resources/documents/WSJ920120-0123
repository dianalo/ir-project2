The IRS issued proposed audit guidelines that clarify itsnew drive to tax the payments many such events receive fromcorporate sponsors. The IRS also invited public comment onthe guidelines; the agency said it was the first time it hastaken such a step when drafting audit rules for use by itsfield agents.</LP><TEXT>   The moves signal an acknowledgment by the IRS of the wideconcern set off when reports surfaced last month that it hadimposed the 34% corporate tax rate on the multimillion-dollarsponsor fees received by two big college football games, theMobil Cotton Bowl and John Hancock Bowl. The IRS essentiallyruled that such fees weren't really charitable donations tothe colleges, but payments for advertising gained throughsigns and media exposure. The IRS deemed advertising anactivity &quot;unrelated&quot; to the charitable purposes of the games.   The IRS stressed at the time that such rulings werespecific to the bowls and didn't constitute precedent. But --fueled by reports that the IRS was targeting other groups,including several Olympic sports federations -- worry spreadthat all corporate sponsor revenue might be taxed,potentially hurting or even killing many events.   The release of general guidelines verifies the IRS'sintent to expand its scrutiny of sponsorships, therebyvalidating the fears of many event organizers. &quot;This isconfirmation of the government's seriousness,&quot; says BruceSkinner, executive director of the International FestivalsAssociation, Port Angeles, Wash., whose 500 U.S. members --ranging from the Kentucky Derby Festival to the Circleville,Ohio, Pumpkin Show -- receive an average of one-third oftheir funding from corporate sponsors.   But the proposed guidelines also offer some relief. Forinstance, they typically won't apply to &quot;purely local&quot;groups, such as Little League baseball teams, communitytheaters and youth orchestras that get &quot;relativelyinsignificant gross revenue from corporate sponsors andgenerally operate with significant amounts of volunteerlabor,&quot; according to the IRS guidelines.   &quot;We aren't interested in putting organizations out ofbusiness,&quot; Marc Owens, director of the IRS division thatdrafted the guidelines, said in an interview. Still, he said,the IRS is concerned about groups that receive &quot;substantial&quot;sponsor fees and provide significant &quot;commercial benefits&quot; inreturn.   Mr. Owens didn't project how much the IRS hoped to collectthrough its scrutiny of sponsorships. But overall, nonprofitevents now receive an estimated $1.1 billion annually insponsor fees, says Special Events Report, a Chicagonewsletter. The John Hancock Bowl, for instance, stands tolose a third of the estimated $1 million it gets annuallyfrom its corporate namesake, the big Boston insurer.   Among many recommendations, the guidelines urge IRSauditors to probe for factors &quot;tending&quot; to indicate taxablearrangements, such as when agreements require a sponsor'sname to be &quot;prominently placed throughout the stadium, arenaor other site where the event is held&quot; -- a red flag thathelped attract IRS attention to the college bowls, forexample. The guidelines instruct agents to review carefullyall oral and written agreements between groups and sponsors,and suggest that &quot;it may be beneficial&quot; to review films,tapes or pictures to gauge the extent to which a sponsor'sname is depicted.   The proposed guidelines also urge IRS auditors to considerwhether sponsors are promised benefits beyond publicity --special seating, travel and lodging at the event, or even&quot;chauffer-driven limousines, hospitality suites and lavishreceptions.&quot;   Donald Alexander, a former IRS commissioner who nowrepresents nonprofit groups as a Washington, D.C., attorney,said he welcomed the added guidance the proposed rulesprovide to worried events organizers. But he and otherobservers cautioned that the guidelines don't go far enoughin detailing the criteria needed to cover the broad range ofsponsored activities.   The IRS is likely to receive significant advice on thatcount during the 60-day comment period, but it could beshort-circuited. That is because many nonprofit groups arepinning their hopes on expected appeals of the IRS rulings inthe bowl cases -- and lobbying Congress to exempt taxation ofsponsorship revenue.</TEXT></DOC>
