U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker held that First CityFinancial Corp. Ltd. ``with an excess of boldness'' deliberatelyviolated federal securities law by failing to make timelydisclosures that it had purchased 5 percent of Ashland's stock.   Parker found that First City, through a subsidiary headed byMarc Belzberg, circumvented the disclosure requirement by arrangingto acquire the bulk of its 1.4 million Ashland shares by``parking'' its stock with the brokerage firm Bear Stearns andamp; Co.Inc.   The judge said he would grant an injunction barring Belzberg andhis family's Canadian-based company from engaging in further``stock parking'' arrangements to conceal ownership of securities.   He also ordered First City to give up $2.7 million in profits itmade in the stock transactions that violated Section 13 (d) of the1934 Securities Exchange Act.   The decision was hailed as a significant victory by theSecurities and Exchange Commission, which contends that ``stockparking'' should be treated as a serious problem despitecontentions by many on Wall Street that it is only a minor,technical violation.   Parker said First City's ``surreptitious effort to accumulate ablock of shares in Ashland is the precise type of evil Section13(d) was directed to prevent.''   The requirement is designed to prevent companies involved intakeovers from continuing to acquire shares of a company's stock atartificially low prices by concealing large purchases from otherinvestors.   ``We regard it as a terrific victory,'' said Thomas C. Newkirk,the SEC's chief litigation counsel. ``Its importance goes beyondthe facts of this particular case because it shows the seriousnesswith which Judge Parker treated the violations which we proved,''he said.   Newkirk said the judgment marked the first time the SEC hadtaken enforcement action under the disclosure provision of the 1934law.   The decision is also significant because of the SEC'sinvestigation of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. One focus of theDrexel probe is the allegation that the investment firm's junk bondchief, Michael Milken, engaged in a stock parking scheme withformer speculator and insider-trader Ivan Boesky.   Milken is represented by Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton andamp;Garrison, the same New York law firm that defended Mark Belzberg inthe trial before Parker last year in U.S. District Court. Belzbergwas represented by Arthur L. Liman, counsel to the SenateIran-Contra committee.   The judge rejected Belzberg's testimony that a Bear Stearnsexecutive misunderstood a March 4, 1986 conversation which led tothe immediate purchase of 20,500 shares of Ashland on behalf ofFirst City. The broker testified that he undertood he had beendirected to purchase the stock for Belzberg and continued to do so.   Following that purchase, First City owned more than 5 percent ofAshland Oil and had 10 days to make that disclosure.   But Parker found that Bear Stearns, which was not charged withwrongdoing, continued to purchase more shares of Ashland stock forFirst City, which did not disclose its 5 percent interest in theoil company until March 26, 12 days after the legal deadline formaking the report.   First City, headed by Marc Belzberg's father, Canadianbusinessman Samuel Belzberg, dropped its bid to take over Ashland,but made a $15.4 million profit when it sold its shares back to theoil company.   Parker calculated that First City should forfeit $2.7 million inprofits on the 890,000 shares it purchased during the period whenits 5 percent stake in Ashland should have been public knowledge.   ``We are obviously deeply disappointed by the court's decision.We fought because we believed the SEC was wrong in the facts andthe law. We still believe that and we intend to appeal,'' thecompany said in a statement issued by its Toronto office.   In April, First City agreed to pay a $400,000 fine to settle aFederal Trade Commission complaint that its Ashland bid hadviolated the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust law. The FTC complaintalleged that First City failed to notify the agency of Ashlandstock purchases exceeding $15 million.</TEXT></DOC>
