And it showed everywhere in the A's4-3 win over the Baltimore Orioles, from an impressive, sweat-drenched bit ofpitching by Rick Honeycutt to escape a bases-loaded, none-out mess in theseventh inning to Rickey Henderson's game-winning homer in the eighth to JoseCanseco's 27th homer in the sixth, a game-tying three-run line drive.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ORNERY A'S TOP ORIOLESHONEYCUTT ESCAPES JAM TO EARN WIN  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Chart attached to the end of this article  </MEMO><TEXT>     The A's are doing all the right things, and with a serious,don't-mess-with-us attitude, too. Canseco was ready to tangle with alligatorwrestler Ben McDonald when he was hit on the back of the neck by a lazyMcDonald curve in the first, and Henderson deemed Canseco's shot worthy of anenthusiastic double bash at the plate.;    The A's swept the three-gameseries, their first sweep on the road this season. They've won six of theirlast seven, and they've moved to four games behind the Minnesota Twins.;    &quot;Ithink what happens with us, everybody said after the All-Star break, now thisis the time we're supposed to kick everybody's (butt),&quot; said Dennis Eckersley,who pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his 25th save. &quot;So, it didn't happen right awayon the homestand. Maybe we can make it happen on this road trip.&quot;;    You hearthings like that all over the clubhouse. Or as Canseco so aptly put it, &quot;Whatwe saw today was vintage Oakland A's of the past.&quot;;    The A's haven't seenthis sort of contribution from Henderson, the 1990 American League MVP, oftenthis season. He went 3 for 4 with the homer and scored twice. Canseco remainedtied Detroit's Cecil Fielder for the major league home run lead.;    There arestill glitches, of course. Bob Welch created lots of work for himself,throwing 116 pitches in six innings. That bases-loaded situation in whichHoneycutt found himself was of his own creation. And there was some questionabout how Eckersley would respond, since he was responsible for the A's oneloss during this stretch his last time out.;    Honeycutt's performance Sundaycould be of lasting importance. The bullpen has failed so miserably and withsuch frequency that it desperately needed a clutch performance to restorefaith.;    &quot;You've got to build off whatever you can build on,&quot; Honeycuttsaid. &quot;We have struggled at times for the most part of the year. For us to gofrom here, the bullpen's going to have to carry its share of the load like wehave for the last few years. Hopefully, it's a step in the right direction.&quot;;   Honeycutt pitched with agonizing care after he gave up a double to JoeOrsulak, walked Cal Ripken intentionally, then got a pitch up to Dwight Evansfor a single. He struck out Randy Milligan on a full-count slider, got ChitoMartinez on three pitches, then battled Leo Gomez to a full count. Gomezfouled off a couple before flying out to right field.;    &quot;I just tried tomake as nasty a pitch as I could. I tried to make each pitch perfect, andfortunately I made enough to get people out,&quot; Honeycutt said. &quot;I think justgetting Milligan not to put the ball in play (was central). If he does put itin play, I've got to have a groundball, probably to third base or back to me,because if he puts it in play anywhere else, you're going to score a run. The3-2 pitch to Milligan was the most crucial pitch I threw.&quot;;    Honeycuttpitched two innings and picked up the win when Henderson sent a 400-foot homerto left on a 1-and-0 count against McDonald. The win gave Honeycutt victoriesagainst 25 of the 26 major league teams, and he beat the 26th team, the LosAngeles Dodgers, in the 1988 World Series.; HOW THEY SCORED;    Orioles 1st --Orsulak singled with one out.
