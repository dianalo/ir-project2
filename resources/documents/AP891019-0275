In mansion dining rooms, a perfectlyclear consomme shows the epitome of elegance. For centuries, peoplehave counted on soup.   ``People like soup because it not only tastes good but they feelthat they are doing something good for themselves,'' said LeeBailey, author of the cookbook ``Soup Meals.'' ``It gives you allthe feelings of security that we seem to need more as time goesby.''   Although soups are made year-round, harvests seem to bring themmore to mind. The vegetables available enable the home cook to tryall sorts of combinations.   ``Cabbage and broccoli are very strong. You have to be carefulwhen you use them with other things. They combine well withpotatoes, but they can overwhelm other things,'' Bailey said. ``Youcan otherwise combine anything that suits your fancy.''   Soups have several advantages. In most kitchens, an inventivecook can find ingredients for a serviceable soup. Soup can be madeahead. And most soups can be frozen.   If using canned stock, taste the soup before adding salt. Theflavor of canned stock can be substantially improved by letting itsimmer for a half hour or so with chopped carrots, onions andcelery before it is used.   For cream soups, pureed vegetables or rice can substitute forcream.   Here are some recipes from Lee Bailey's ``Soup Meals'' (ClarksonN. Potter Inc., 1989, $19.95):</TEXT><NOTE>Turkey and Vegetable Soup</NOTE><NOTE>Ingredients</NOTE><TEXT>   2 tablespoon safflower oil   1 raw turkey breast carcass with meat on bones, chopped roughlyinto 4 or 5 pieces   7 cups chicken stock   4 cups water   { large red onion, peeled and thinly sliced   2 cups fresh green beans, pureed to the consistency of relish   1{ pounds potatoes, peeled and cubed   4 large sprigs parsley, chopped   { teaspoon black pepper   1 10-ounce package frozen peas   In the safflower oil, carefully and thoroughly brown the turkeycarcass parts and any bits of leftover meat.

Remove meat from bones andchop coarsely. Discard bones.   Add onion and green bean puree to the liquid and simmer oververy low heat. Add potatoes and set timer for five minutes.
