An unnamed administration official told The Washington Post thedocuments were in an archive whose contents were available to thecommittees if they specifically requested them. But the panelsnever asked to see the documents, the official said.   One document refers to then-Vice President George Bush's secretinvolvement in a deal to reward Honduras for aiding the NicaraguanContras, the newspaper reported in today's editions.   The paper said the official's account left open the possibilitythe committees would not have known the contents of the documentsin question and would not have known to request them.   Key members of the Iran-Contra panels have raised thepossibility that several important White House documents on formerPresident Reagan and Bush's role in efforts to reward those aidingthe Contras were withheld from the House and Senate panels.   Bush has said twice that the documents, which were releasedduring the trial of former White House aide Oliver North, were``available'' to the Iran-Contra committees.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday night thedocuments in North's National Security Council office wereimmediately seized by the FBI and sealed up on the late November1986 weekend during the initial inquiry into the Iran-Contra affairby then Attorney General Edwin Meese.   He added that the documents had been in the joint custody of theWhite House and the FBI and said the White House had at leastpartial custody because many of the documents were classified.   He said the White House had ``some say'' in the way thedocuments were dispersed, but he insisted that at no time were theyoff-limits to the committees.</TEXT></DOC>
