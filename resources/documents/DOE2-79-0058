The following results were obtained by intravenous/sup 133/Xe method : 1. There was a reducing tendency of the CBF (hemisphere)on hematoma side, in most cases. While, the groups of headache and disturbancesof consciousness did not give a laterality between hematoma and oppositeside without the group of hemiparesis. 2. The absolute values of theCBF in the groups of headache and disturbances of consciousness werecorrelated with the clinical symptoms. In the group of hemiparesis, thelaterality between hematoma and opposite side was correlated with theclinical symptoms. 3. In the group of hemiparesis, the F-flow (fast-flow)had sensitive reaction more than the ISI (initial slope index) with symptomaticimprovement. 4. It was found that there was not an increase in the absolutevalue of the CBF, which was under the normal limit between pre- and post-operationsin the case without improvement. By SPECT (Method of IMP), the followingresults were obtained : 1. There was the area of defect at the locationof hematoma and the CBF tended to reduce at the subcortical white matterand at the basal ganglia of hematoma side. 2. The CBF of the contralateralhematoma side in the hemisphere of cerebellum was also tended to reduce.</TEXT></DOC>
