DALY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vice President George Bush touched off a quickchorus of challenges and criticism from environmentalists andelected officials with his claim to be a lifelong environmentalist.   Democrat Michael Dukakis dismissed Bush's assertion on Wednesdayas ``an election-year conversion.''   Sen. George Mitchell, a Maine Democrat who has pushed acid rainlegislation, asked where Bush was for the past seven years when theReagan administration slashed funding for water pollution and triedto block renewal of the Clean Air Act.   Blake Early, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, said that if Bushis an environmentalist, ``it comes as a revelation to us.''   And Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energyand Commerce Committee, questioned the depth of Bush's ``suddencommitment'' to the environment, saying ``He's still like the pianoplayer in the bordello who doesn't know what's going on upstairs.''   Dingell, for his part, has been a leading opponent ofenvironmental legislation perceived as costly to the auto industryin his home state. He has also fought acid rain legislation inalliance with Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia,a coal state.   Bush, who planned to push the environmental theme again today bytaking a boat cruise of Boston Harbor, stood on the shore of LakeErie in Michigan on Wednesday and promised to take swift action onacid rain if elected.   The Republican presidential nominee also said he would convene aglobal conference during his first year in the White House toaddress the ``greenhouse'' effect. He called for wetlandsprotection and pledged a policy of ``zero tolerance'' for toxicpolluters.   But Bush, who aides said was trying to distinguish himself fromReagan administration policies, may have touched off a backlashthat his campaign did not intend.   In Boston, the Dukakis campaign moved quickly to help coordinatea protest that would greet Bush on land, on the harbor and in theair with demonstrations, boats and an airborne banner.   Before leaving Massachusetts on Wednesday for a western campaignswing, Dukakis defended his own record on Boston Harbor as governorand criticized the Reagan administration for trying to eliminatefederal funding for sewage treatment plants.   ``It's been polluted for hundreds of years, and I'm very proudto be the governor's who's cleaning it up,'' Dukakis said. ``And weare doing it no thanks to Vice President Bush and theadministration he is part of.''   Earlier this summer, Dukakis broke ground for a cleanup projectfor the harbor, but his critics complained he should have dealtwith the problem years ago.   Dukakis was joined at a Statehouse press conference by Mitchell,who was asked about Bush's promise to work with Congress on a ``settimetable'' for reducing acid rain.   ``My question is, where has the vice president been for the pastseven years?'' Mitchell asked, faulting the Reagan administrationfor its ``outright opposition'' to his acid rain legislation.   Dingell, an influential House Democrat, said Bush's stance was``a welcome novelty coming from this administration'' that followed``eight years of tranquil repose by Mr. Bush in the office of vicepresident.''   On Bush's acid rain commitment, Early said: ``Talk is cheap.''He questioned what role Bush took in the early 1980s when the WhiteHouse blocked its own Environmental Protection Agency head fromseeking a 4 million ton reduction in pollutants blamed for acidrain.   In Boston, state Sen. William Golden, a Dukakis supporter whohas been prominent in the Boston Harbor cleanup effort, said he washelping to coordinate the anti-Bush protest with local groups,including the Audubon Society, Greenpeace, Clean Water Action, theNational Toxics Campaign and others.   The first step was a press conference, where Mitchell faultedthe Reagan-Bush administration for trying to eliminate the federalwater pollution control program, twice vetoing the Clean Water Act,trying to delay lead reduction in gasoline and favoring studiesover action on acid rain.   ``For George Bush to come here and present himself as anenvironmentalist, it's like Bonnie and Clyde coming out for guncontrol,'' former U.S. Sen. Paul Tsongas told the press conference.</TEXT></DOC>
