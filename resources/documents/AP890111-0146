The Seattle factory which made parts for the CFM56 engine used bythe Boeing 737 also manufactured a check and flow valve for the F404engine aboard the Navy's FA-18 fighter, GE spokesman Richard Kennedysaid Wednesday.   A letter from a GE attorney last year said test records may havebeen falsified for the fighter plane valves. Papers filed by theoffice of the U.S. attorney in Cincinnati said the FBI isinvestigating that case.   Forty-four people died in the Boeing 737 crash, in which the crewapparently turned off the right engine after the left engine failedfor unexplained reasons. The investigation of the crash iscontinuing.   The timer valve manufactured by GE for the CFM56 engine on the737 could not have caused the turbine to fail even if the valvemalfunctioned, Kennedy said in telephone interview from his officein Cincinnati.   However, GE attorney Robert C. Anderson said in a letter datedJune 2, 1988, that: ``In late May 1988, it was discovered that priorto July 1987, a particular flow leak check, which is required byGEAE (General Electric Aircraft Engine) specifications, was notperformed on the F404 check and drain valves.''   ``It is believed that the test was discontinued sometime in 1983,possibly as a result of the test fixture becoming broken,'' Andersonsaid the letter, obtained by The Associated Press.   ``The test was reinstituted in July 1987 when the problem wasdetected by lower level personnel in the plant,'' the letter said.   ``During the period involved, it is also believed that operatorsmay have falsified internal test records which are maintained toreflect actual test readings,'' Anderson said in the letter.   Anderson's letter does not indicate the total number of enginesor their value, but said that the deliveries covered the periods ofApril-May 1984, April-May 1985, April-May 1986, and April-May 1987.   Navy spokeswoman Lt. Nettie Johnson said that the F404 was usedin the FA-18 fighter, but was unable to say immediately whether theaircraft had experienced problems from faulty check and drain valves.   Defense Department officials said they had received Anderson'sletter as part of what they called a ``voluntary disclosureprogram'' for companies that believe they have not met the terms oftheir contracts.   The inspector general's office in the Pentagon, in conjunctionwith the FBI, is investigating the admissions in the letter, saidthe sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   ``In nearly every instance of voluntary disclosure, aninvestigation follows,'' said one source who was familiar with thecase. ``Falsifying records falls into the area of productsubstitution, in which the government pays for something to betested, and it is not tested.''   James Helmer, an attorney representing the former manager of theGE plant, said his client had been questioned in connection with theinvestigation last Oct. 14 by two FBI agents and a representative ofthe Air Force.   Helmer's client, Anthony L. Divencenzo, filed suit againstGeneral Electric last year on behalf of the government, seeking torecover damages for more than 2,000 F404 engines that Helmer saidwere delivered without inspection.   At the request of the Justice Department, all documents in theDivencenzo suit remained under seal until last Friday, when U.S.District Court Judge Carl Rubin denied a federal motion to allow theJustice Department until Feb. 1 to decide whether to join the caseas a plaintiff.   The motion, filed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Gerald F. Kaminski,said ``the investigation of the allegations set forth in thecomplaint that is being conducted by the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation is not complete due to the factual complexitiesinvolved in the case.''   ``While the criminal investigation may take substantially longerto conclude, it is anticipated that the FBI will obtain sufficientinformation to determine whether or not it will intervene herein,''said the federal motion.   The Justice, Defense and Navy Departments will require anotherweek to review that information, the motion said.   Michael Crites, U.S. attorney for Cincinnati, declined to diclosefurther details of the investigation or indicate when the governmentwould decide whether to intervene.   ``I can't say anything more than what was in that motion, whichis a matter of public record,'' Crites said in a telephoneinterview. Asked when the government would make its decision, Critessaid: ``I don't have a timetable on it.''</TEXT></DOC>
