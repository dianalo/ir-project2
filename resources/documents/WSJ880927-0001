Greenberger (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FORGN </CO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> UNITED NATIONS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan, for years a harsh critic of the United Nations, said the recent successes and budget reforms of the international body have made it &quot;a better place than it was eight years ago.&quot;    In his farewell address to the General Assembly, Mr. Reagan reserved his most passionate language to urge the U.N. to fight &quot;the terror&quot; of chemical warfare. Citing the use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war, he called upon the U.N. to convene a conference to reverse the &quot;serious erosion&quot; of a 1925 treaty banning use of such weapons. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater later said the administration would like to hold a meeting before the end of Mr. Reagan's term in January.    In his speech, Mr. Reagan warned that the recent use of poison gas, coming as the world is &quot;diminishing the awful cloud of nuclear terror,&quot; threatens &quot;the moral and legal strictures that have held these weapons in check since World War I.&quot;    The president avoided what would have been a harsh reception at the U.N. by agreeing earlier this month to release $467 million that the U.S. owes the body. Delegates nevertheless gave him only polite applause during a 36-minute address that generally praised the U.N. for recent breakthroughs in peace-making and for budget reforms.    The U.N. this year helped negotiate peace agreements aimed at ending wars in Afghanistan and the western Sahara, and between Iran and Iraq. It also is helping mediate disputes in southern Africa, Cambodia and Cyprus. &quot;We salute you for those accomplishments,&quot; Mr. Reagan said to U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.    In addition, Mr. Reagan noted, the U.N. has cut personnel and established spending priorities.    In the past, Mr. Reagan has preferred unilateral action over multinational efforts, but in yesterday's speech, he called for a larger role for institutions like the U.N. He said the U.N. should expand its work to blot out the &quot;scourge&quot; of terrorism and hostage-taking, to fight the AIDS crisis and to stop drug traffickers.    The apparent softening in Mr. Reagan's attitude toward the U.N. parallels an easing in his hard-line stance toward the Soviet Union. But it could cause some embarrassment for his vice president, Republican presidential candidate George Bush. Citing his own experience as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. during the Nixon administration, Mr. Bush frequently scoffs at his opponent, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, for preferring multilateral solutions to international problems.    Mr. Reagan's speech marked the sixth time the president has spoken to the General Assembly. That's more than any previous U.S. president, he noted. He contrasted the U.N.'s current activities to actions he has criticized in the past.    Dwelling at length on human rights, he noted that the U.N. for the first time is investigating Cuba's human-rights record. For years, he said, Cuba &quot;escaped United Nations censure or even scrutiny.&quot; Now, he said, Cuban leader Fidel Castro has begun &quot;to free some political prisoners, improve prison conditions and tolerate the existence of a small, independent national human rights group.&quot;    He also noted &quot;philosophical reform&quot; at the U.N., mentioning an increased emphasis during a special session in Africa on free-market incentives and the lessening of state controls to spur economic development.    The president praised Soviet cooperation in working to resolve many regional disputes. He said that if Soviet reforms are successful, &quot;there is the prospect of not only a new era of Soviet-American relations, but a new age of world peace.&quot;    But, he cited Nicaragua as a glaring exception to progress in peacemaking, and he decried &quot;the continuing deterioration of human rights in Nicaragua and the refusal of the tiny elite now ruling that nation to honor promises of democracy. . . .&quot; He pledged to continue backing the Contra rebels who are fighting Nicaragua's Sandinista regime. </TEXT></DOC>
