Its 5.1 million peopleare about one-tenth of Britain's population, and its 30,000 squaremiles represent about one-third of the kingdom.   Its economy now depends on services and high technology, ratherthan basic industries, largely because it has managed to attractoutside investment _ principally American investors in theelectronics industry, who have created a ``Silicon Glen'' in centralScotland.   The North Sea oil industry has been recovering from a sharpdownturn in 1986. Scotland's huge financial services sector isgrowing a bit.   The historic industries of whisky, salmon fishing and woolenshave modernized and are thriving, partly by targeting the upscalemarket.   Unemployment, at 10.3 percent, is finally falling, and Scottishbusinessmen are looking confident.   ``Generally the scene is quite good,'' said John Davidson,Scottish director of the Confederation of British Industry.   The Scottish economy grew an estimated 3.5 percent last year,compared with 4.5 percent in Britain overall. It should grow as muchas 3 percent this year, faster, for a change, than Britain, saidGordon Hughes, a University of Edinburgh professor.   But not everybody's assessment is sunny, and many problemsremain. Sillars, the nationalist, said: ``There's a lot of economicanxiety around in Scotland.''   Scotland has been painfully wrenched from its dependence on itsdeclining heavy industries and its job losses, which have beenexacerbated by Mrs. Thatcher's refusal to use taxpayers' money torescue ailing industries.   Scotland's unemployment rate remains 3.3 percentage points higherthan the British average of 7 percent.   The number of people employed in steel, shipbuilding, coal andthe heavy engineering industries has fallen in 30 years from 300,000to about 50,000, Davidson said.   ``There is an incredibly strong attachment to (what) representsScottish industrial heritage,'' Hughes said. ``There is an enormousreluctance to come to terms with that and change that.''   Critics complain that inward investment is creating a brancheconomy based on low-skilled assembly jobs.   ``The problem with Scotland is that we don't have (new)indigenous industry,'' said Martin Gregson, a Scottish entrepreneur.   Many of the jobs created by the inward investment go to women,Davidson said.   ``I think it has a very distinct effect on the way Scotlandlives. We're a very chauvinistic society,'' he said.   Strongly Presbyterian, Scotland prides itself on its respect forauthority, its moral standards, work ethic and collective spirit.   Scotland also is concerned about outside takeovers of itsrelatively small number of public companies. Many Scots lay theblame for this on Mrs. Thatcher's free-market policies. There alsois lingering resentment that Scotland doesn't benefit more fromNorth Sea oil revenue.   The long list of complaints underscores that Scotland ``has got avery big chip on its shoulder,'' said Hughes, the professor. ``Thereis an enormous sense of oppression. Everything is the sense of theEnglish against Scotland.   ``There's a need to step back from that kind of pattern.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, March 12</NOTE></DOC>
