The NCI compared mortality data in 107 countiessurrounding all 62 U.S. nuclear facilities -- 52 commercialpower plants, nine Department of Energy research and weaponsplants, and one commercial fuel-reprocessing plant -- inoperation before 1982 with data from demographically similarcounties that weren't close to nuclear facilities.Researchers found &quot;no evidence to suggest that the occurrenceof leukemia or any other form of cancer was generally higherin the study counties than the control counties.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Both proponents and opponents of nuclear power agree thatthe NCI survey is the nation's most comprehensive assessmentof the relationship between proximity to nuclear facilitiesand cancer mortality.   But Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), who requested thestudy, said the study &quot;isn't a clean bill of health for thenuclear industry&quot; because it didn't go far enough. Incontrast, the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, a nucleartrade group, said the study &quot;should put the public at easethat living near a nuclear plant isn't harmful to theirhealth.&quot;   No matter how reassuring its findings, the study isn'tlikely to improve the prospects for the construction of newnuclear plants. Because of concerns about cost, nuclear wastedisposal, safety and regulatory delay, there hasn't been anorder for a new nuclear plant in the U.S. since 1978.</TEXT></DOC>
