An independent inquiry headed by former High Court Chief JusticeSir Harry Gibbs found that McBride deliberately falsified theresults of a 1980 experiment on rabbits involving birth defects.   McBride, 61, immediately resigned as head of research at theSydney-based Foundation 41, which he started in 1971 to researchbirth defects. The institution was financed by the proceeds ofinternational awards for his work on thalidomide.   About 8,000 babies were born around the world with severedeformities attributed to thalidomide, a sedative administered topregnant women, until McBride's findings led to its banning.   McBride issued a statement through lawyers protesting hisinnocence, saying: ``I reject absolutely the finding that scientificfraud occurred in connection with the experiment.''   It said he resigned ``because I don't wish that there be anydoubt cast over the work that I and the Foundation have done overthe past 16 years''.   The foundation's board called the inquiry after pressure from thescientific community about fraud allegations by two former researchassistants, broadcast on an Australian Broadcasting Corp. radioprogram last December.   Researchers Phil Vardy and Jill French said that McBride reportedin a 1982 edition of the Australian Journal of Biological Sciencesthat two of eight rabbits given the drug Scopolamine Hydrobromideproduced deformed fetuses.   Vardy and French claimed that in fact only one of six rabbitsproduced deformed offspring, that a dosage table was altered andthat the article falsely reported that fetuses were sectioned andcontrol rabbits were kept.   Gibbs and two medical researchers began hearing evidence insecret in July.   In a 25-page report released late Wednesday, they supported theallegations and found that McBride ``deliberately falsified'' thecontents of the article.   ``The experiment mentioned in that paper was not conducted inaccordance with proper scientific method and was not honestlyreported,'' they found.   ``The above experiment and its published results does suggestthat in relation to the publication of those results Dr. McBride waslacking in scientific integrity.''   The report said McBride claimed in evidence that a drug companywas out to destroy his credibility as a witness in legal action byusers of a morning sickness drug. But it said no evidence of biaswas found among the witnesses against him.   Foundation 41's board said in a statement it accepted McBride'sresignation as honorary medical director of the foundation ``withregret'' and appreciated his offer to continue to serve while areplacement was found.</TEXT></DOC>
