<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-45-0058 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the US and other countries, rocket development and related activitieshave changed considerably after the accident of space shuttle 'Challenger'.Demand for disposable rockets is increasing; the USSR and China are enteringthe markets with inexpensive products. Also, demand for the developmentof rockets which can launch heavy payload is arising; NASA, the USSR,and European countries are endeavoring to develop large rockets. Forsolid-fuel rockets, low-pollution composites are being developed to copewith problems of environmental pollution caused by propellants. In thefield of liquid-fuel rockets, Japan and other countries are endeavoringto develop engines using liquid oxygen and hydrocarbon fuels so thatthey can be in large liquid-fuel booster rockets. Research and developmentactivities for electric propulsion are more and more energetic. Furthereffort seems necessary to make electric propulsion practical. (18 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
