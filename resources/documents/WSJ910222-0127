Operating expenses more than doubled to $239.7 millionfrom $103.9 million in the prior-year quarter. The companyincreased its bad-debt reserves, but did not break out thefigures.   Operating revenue more than doubled to $279.7 million from$132.5 million, boosted by the results at the Mirage casinoresort on the Las Vegas Strip. For 1990, its first full yearof operation, the Mirage shattered casino industry records byproducing more than $409 million in gambling revenue.   For the year, Golden Nugget reported net income of $29.7million, or $1.57 a share, based on 18.9 million shares fullydiluted, versus a net loss of $21.2 million, or $1.27 ashare, in 1989 based on 16.7 million shares fully diluted.Operating expenses jumped to $716.8 million from $242.6million, and nonoperating expenses were $146.9 millioncompared with $89.7 million. Operating revenue totaled $909million, up from $299.9 million in 1989.   Golden Nugget's stock jumped $2.25 to $26.125 in New YorkStock Exchange composite trading. The increase was promptedin part by Golden Nugget's statement that its 1990 after-taxcash flow was about $123 million, or $6.50 a share. Thecompany calculates after-tax cash flow by adding pretaxincome, noncash interest expense, depreciation andamortization and write-offs; it then subtracts total non-cashinterest income and estimated tax payments.   Cash and marketable securities at year end totaled $169million, of which $35 million is restricted for expansionprojects.   Stephen A. Wynn, chairman, cautioned that the Persian Gulfwar and the economic slowdown could erode Golden Nugget's1991 operating results.</TEXT></DOC>
