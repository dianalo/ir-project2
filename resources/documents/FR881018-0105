Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, andStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change </ITAG>In its filing with Commission, the self-regulatory organization includedstatements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule changeand discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. Thetext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in ItemIV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, setforth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspectsof such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and StatutoryBasis for the Proposed Rule Change  The proposed rule change represents amendments to SR-PHLX-88-7 regardingthe PHLX's proposal to trade CIPs. As originally filed, a CIP holder waspermitted to exercise the cash-out privilege once each quarter. In AmendmentNo. 2 to the CIP rule filing, the original proposal was amended to providefor a daily as opposed to quarterly ability of a CIP holder to exercisethe cash-out privilege. This change and how it will operationally worknecessitates changes in proposed Rule 1008B to delineate precisely requirementsfor tendering exercise instructions to The Options Clearing Corporation(``OCC''). The Exchange has re-evaluated the cash-out privilege and has determinedto provide CIP holders the ability to cash-out their CIP positions on adaily basis rather than just on a quarterly basis. With the exception notedbelow, those exercising the cash-out privilege will receive the CIP indexvalue less one half of one percent of that value as calculated at the closeof trading one business day following the date on which the cash-out privilegeis exercised. The Exchange has determined that those exercising the cash-outprivilege on any business day by 4:15 p.m. may receive the closing indexvalue as calculated on the business day following the exercise day of thecash-out privilege. As an exception to exercise of the cash-out privilegeset forth above, those exercising the cash-out privilege on the businessday prior to the third Friday of March, June, September and Decemer willreceive the full CIP index value based on the opening prices of each ofthe securities in the underlying CIP index on those respective third Fridays.This coincides with the quarterly payment of dividend equivalents by theCIP sellers to CIP purchasers, as well as the expiration of certain stockindex options and stock index futures. The Exchange believes this change will make CIPs more attractive to publicinvestors that may wish to acquire CIP positions. It should also aid inassuring that CIPs do not trade at prices too far below the value of theunderlying index. The \1/2\ percent differential from the index value subtractedfrom CIP holders exercising the cash-out privilege on any day except thebusiness day prior to the third Friday of March, June, September and Decemberreflects that the daily cash-out privilege is a distinct benefit to CIPholders who also have the ability to close out their positions for cashin the market and avoid such discount. In this regard, CIP writers whowere assigned a CIP exercise on all but the quarterly exercise dates needonly tender 99\1/2\% of the closing index value to exercising CIP holders.Generally, for daily exercises, exercise instructions must be deliveredto the OCC pursuant to the OCC's procedures, currently by 8:00 p.m. EasternTime of the day the particular CIP position is exercised. Upon exerciseof the cash-out privilege, the CIP holder is entitled to the followingbusiness day's closing index value. The PHLX is mindful that the proposedrule change would permit the exercise of the cash-out privilege based onpublic news and events transpiring after the close of CIP trading and thestocks comprising the CIP indices up to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the OCC'scut-off time for receiving exercise instructions. The PHLX, however, doesnot believe that this exercise instruction cut-off procedure disadvantagesCIP writers as exercising CIP holders are not assured of the index priceupon which they are cashed out until after the lapse of one trading day.On quarterly exercise, because exercising CIP holders will be given thefollowing business day's opening CIP index value, exercising CIP holderswill be precluded from taking advantage of information occurring afterthe close of trading on the day of exercise. Accordingly, exercising CIPholders on the Quarterly Exercise Day must tender exercise instructionsand prepare such instructions by 4:15 p.m. Eastern Time. Additionally,the proposed rule change requires PHLX member organizations tendering exercisenotices for 25 or more CIP round lots on behalf of their own account orcustomers to send a memorandum informing the PHLX of such by 4:15 p.m.Eastern Time.The proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act,which provides in part that the rules of the Exchange be designed to preventfraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to facilitate transactionsin securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of afree and open market and to protect investors and the public interest.B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on CompetitionThe Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will imposeany inappropriate burden on competition.C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the ProposedRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or OthersThe PHLX has prepared this rule change in close coordination with the OCC.<ITAG tagnum="85">III.
