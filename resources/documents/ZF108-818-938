SullivanandM;Codenoll Technology Corp. plans to announce at NetWorld 90 next week newfiber-optic media that uses plastic instead of glass to drastically lower thecost of the high-performance media, according to company officials.andM;Also at the Dallas trade show, Codenoll will round out its network adapterline with a fiber Ethernet card for Micro Channel computers.andM;The plastic fiber-optic media and connectors, co-developed by General MotorsCorp. and Codenoll, will lower fiber costs to about 15 cents per foot -- thecurrent cost of unshielded twisted-pair wiring, said J.P.andP;  Chalmin, seniorvice president of marketing and sales for Codenoll in Yonkers, N.Y.andO;Fiber-optic glass cabling is currently about 40 cents per foot, he said.andP;  Theproducts are due next year.andM;&quot;With increasing demands placed on networks, fiber becomes more attractive,&quot;said Chalmin.andP;  &quot;As the costs come down, fiber will be in more of a head-oncompetition with other technologies.&quot; Fiber-optic media is typically used forhigh-performance, 100M-bps Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) networks.andM;While the cost of cabling may come down, the cost of FDDI boards themselvesis still too prohibitive to allow widespread installation, said Lee Doyle,manager of LAN research for International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass.andO;Codenoll's existing FDDI adapter is $3,995.andM;Codenoll's new Micro Channel Ethernet cards, which will work with the glassfiber-optic cabling, will be available following NetWorld, said Brian Ramsey,the firm's director of strategic development.andP;  Running 10M-bps Ethernet overfiber provides better data protection and distances of up to 4.5 kilometersbetween devices.andM;The CodeNet-832X cards are available in three flavors: the $895 CodeNet-8320passive star, the $895 CodeNet-8321 Ethernet FOIRL (Fiber Optic InterRepeater Link), and the $995 CodeNet-8322 Codenoll downward-compatiblepassive-star adapter.andM;Modularly designed for upgrading to Extended Industry Standard Architecture(EISA) or ISA environments, Codenoll's fiber-optic Ethernet boards include a16K-byte buffer memory and software drivers for NetWare, LAN Manager, 3Com 3+and 3+Open, IBM LAN Server, Digital's LANworks, Banyan VINES, OS/2 and Unixenvironments.andP;  Users of Codenoll's ISA or EISA fiber Ethernet adapters canswitch to the Micro Channel card for approximately $595.andM;Codenoll can be reached at (914) 965-6300.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
