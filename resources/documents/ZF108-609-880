 T3, ata band-width of 44.736 megabits/sec, has 28 times the capacity of T1.andM;The 1.544-megabit/sec bandwidth of T1 can carry 24 standard digital telephonecircuits as well as 160 9.6-kilobit/sec connections between a host computerand terminals.andM;It might seem unlikely that any organization other than a major telephonecompany would need transmission lines large enough to carry more than 672telephone calls at once.andP;  However, video, distributed computing, local areanetwork connnections, graphics and imaging take up amazingly largebandwidths.andM;Advanced techniques for digitizing video signals cut down on the bandwidthrequired, but full-motion video still eats up a quarter to half of a T1 link.andO;A few teleconferencing sessions quickly can exceed the capacity of one or twoT1s.andP;  distributed computing also draws heavily on network capacity.andP;  Anexample is the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNet), which tiestogether national supercomputing centers and makes their resources widelyavailable to universities and research centers across the country.andM;NSFNet is part of the broader Internet, with connections to other governmentnetworks such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Arpanet andthe Energy Department ESNet, as well as commercial and regional networks.andM;Studies by the National Research council and Office of Science and TechnologyPolicy have concluded that the United States needs new networking technologyto maintain its edge in high-performance computing.andP;  The fastest currentcomputers effectively share both data and computational tasks only at speedsthat approach or exceed T1 rates.andM;These studies recommended a new National Research and Education Network thatwould go far beyond Internet's present capabilities.andP;  The recommendationscall for three-stage development:andM;* Completion of the T1 backbone network for the current Internet.andM;* Creation of a shared backbone network operating at T3 rates.andM;* Later expansion of the T3 backbone and connection of selected researchsites by fiber optics operating at one to three gigabits per second.andM;The widespread popularity of computeraided design and manufacturing systemsand digital document imaging, where a high-resolution image of a single pagecan occupy more than a million bits, severely taxes today's low-speednetworks.andM;Common FaxandM;Although facsimile machines are not high-resolution, their commonavailability also increases the demand for faster networks.andP;  Group IIIfacsimile machines, the present standard in nearly every office, transmit at9.6 kilobits/sec.andP;  Newer Group IV machines use 64 kilobits/sec for betterimaging.andM;In the beginning, local area networks could operate at very high speedsbecause of the short distances between PCs in the same office of building.andO;Ethernet, for example, originally was designed to operate at 10 megabits/sec.andM;The new Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) standard for LANs calls forfiber-optic cable operating at a much faster 100 megabits/sec.andP;  Governmentorganizations such as the Navy and NASA are interested in FDDI.andM;Meanwhile, LAN connections have taken on added momentum from PC andworkstation users.andP;  Accustomed to fast local connections, these people nowwant to communicate with distant LANs.andP;  Satisfactory communicationso betweenFDDI and other extremely fas LANs will take considerable bandwidth on awide-area network.andM;Even so, the coming move to T3 backbone networks will be driven by somethingmore fundamental than faster communications.andP;  As networks grow beyond a fewT1s, T3 links can save money.andM;Tariffs for T1 and T3 show that over short distances, the cost of one T3 isequal to four T1s.andP;  For transcontinental distances, a T3 connection costs asmuch as 9 or 10 T1s, with nearly 30 times a T1's capacity.andM;Intelligent T3 networking devices are on the way for setting up andreconfiguring individual circuits to meet changing needs.andP;  By consolidatingmultiple T1 links into a few T3 connections, network administrators will havemore control over fault isolation and recovery.andP;  Larger but simpler networkswill reduce the complexity of maintenance tasks.andM;The most basic T3 networking devices are simple asynchronous multiplexersthat combine 28 T1 signals into a single T3 circuit.andM;In planning a private T3 network, adherence to standards and commitment toevolutionary development can be important, because T3 networks are far fromthe last step.andP;  Larger systems already are evolving around the proposed newSynchronous Optical Network fiber-optic network standards for the 1990s.andM;Marty Lattman is director of product marketing at Timeplex Inc., WoodcliffLake, N.J.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
