The revisionconsists of a proposed Plan Approval, dated January 21, 1988, imposingrequirements to reduce VOC emissions from three operations at General Electricwhich are not subject to RACT under Massachusetts SIP regulations developedpursuant to EPA's Control Technique Guildlines (CTGs).Massachusetts requested and was granted an extension until December 31,1987 to come into attainment with the National Ambient Air Quality Standard(NAAQS) for ozone. Pursuant to EPA policy, the SIPs of all extension Statesmust require RACT on all non-CTG sources with the potential to emit 100TPY or ore of VOCs. EPA approved Massachusetts Regulation 310 CMR 7.18(17), ``Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT),'' on November 9,1983 (48 FR 51480) as part of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' 1982 ozoneattainment plan. In a November 17, 1982 letter to EPA, the DEQE committedto submit each of the individual 100 TPY RACT determinations it made toEPA for incorporation into the Massachusetts SIP as source-specific SIPrevisions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>General Electric's Pittsfield facility is a large, multi-operation stationarysource of VOCs. The majority of its VOC-emitting processes are subjectto RACT under Massachusetts SIP regulations developed and approved in accordancewith EPA's CTGs. However, General Electric has three non-CTG processesthat have total potential VOC emissions in excess of 100 TPY. Those manufacturingprocesses are referred to as follows:<ITAG tagnum="15">The Large Transformer Group</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">The Ordnance Systems Division</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">The Plastics Business Group</ITAG>While the total, pre-RACT potential to emit of these three processes equals502.9 TPY, the majority of those emisisons, 444 TPY, are methylene chlorideemissions from the Plastic Business Group's laminating resins manufacturingoperations. Although EPA has stated that methylene chloride, because ofnegligible photochemical reactivity, can be exempted from control as aVOC in any SIP (44 FR 32042 and 45 FR 32424), the State of Massachusettsdid not include methylene chloride as an exempt solvent in the definitionof ``volatile organic compounds'' in its federally-approved Ozone AttainmentPlan. Therefore, a source in Massachusetts which uses methylene chlorideis subject to the same control requirements for that solvent as it is forits photochemically reactive VOCs. Therefore, DEQE's proposed Plan ApprovalImposed RACT, in accordance with SIP regulation 310 CMR 7.17(17), on GeneralElectric's Plastics Business Group's operations to control methylene chloridein addition to the Large Transformer Group's and Ordnance Systems Division'soperations which emit reactive VOCs.Summary of DEQE's RACT DeterminationDEQE's January 21, 1988 proposed Plan Approved imposes requirements whichreduce VOC emissions from 502.9 TPY to 117.4 TPY (a 76.7% reduction) atGeneral Electric's three non-CTG manufacturing processes as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s10,10,10</C> <H1> </H1><H1>Pre-RACT potential levels (TPY)</H1><H1>Post-RACT levels (TPY)</H1><ITAG tagnum="2">Large transformer group <D>15.0 </D><D>7.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Military ordnance division <D>10.6 </D><D>8.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Plastics business group <D>477.3 </D><D>\2\ 101.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Totals <D>\1\ 502.9 </D><D>\2\ 117.4</D><F>\1\ 444 TPY are methylene chloride.</F><F>\2\ 84 TPY are methylene chloride.</F></ITAG></ITAG>The DEQE First issued a conditional RACT Plan Approval to General Electricfor its non-CTG processes on May 15, 1986. That Plan Approval was subsequentlyamended by the DEQE on June 17, 1986, October 17, 1986, and July 7, 1987.DEQE amended the Plan Approval on January 21, 1988 to incorporate changesin emissions calculated from the Plastic Business Group and to includethe provisions of a Consent Agreement negotiated between the DEQE and GeneralElectric regarding painting operations in the Ordnance Systems Division.The requirements of the DEQE's January 21, 1988 amended proposed Plan Approvalare summarized below.Large Transformer GroupThe proposed Plan Approval requires the installation of a front panel andpot lid on the Gasket Dipping/Drying operation by September 1, 1986 toreduce process and fugitive emissions.Ordnance System Division1. The proposed Plan Approval requires General Electric to modify the CastingImpregnation process by September 1, 1986 to eliminate the use of keroseneand the hot oil cure bath. It further requires that any substitution forthe kerosene and hot oil cure bath must be a non-VOC containing formulation.2. The proposed Plan Approval requires that General Electric use low/noVOC formulations or a level of control equivalent to low/no VOC by December31, 1991 for all existing Department of Defense (DoD) specified Ordnancecoating operations. The Plan Approval further specifies that low/no VOCformulations means paints and coatings with less than 6.68 pounds of VOCper gallon of solids as applied.3. The proposed Plan Approval requires that General Electric use low/noVOC formulations or a level of control equivalent to low/no VOC by December31, 1987 for all non-DoD specified coating operations. Again, the PlanApproval specifies that low/no VOC formulations means paints and coatingswith less than 6.68 pounds of VOC per gallon of solids applied.4. The proposed Plan Approval restricts the total annual VOC emissionsfrom the coating operations of the Ordnance Systems Division (regardlessof whether the coatings used are DoD-specified or not) to 8.3 TPY.5. The proposed Plan Approval requires that General Electric verify theuse of low/no VOC coatings as required in 2 and 3, above, by January 12,1992. The Plan Approval further specifies that General Electric performthe verification according to EPA Reference Test Method 24 as containedin Appendix A of 40 CFR Part 60, and submit a report summarizing the testresults by March 1, 1992.6. The proposed Plan Approval requires General Electric to track the coatingsused in the Ordnance Division's RACT-subject operations. General Electricmust maintain records of monthly and year-to-date total VOC emissions andVOC emissions expressed in pounds of VOC per gallon of solids applied foreach coating. The Plan Approval further requires that each annual coatingrecord be retained at General Electric's Pittsfield facility for at leasttwo years, and be made available to DEQE upon request.7. The proposed Plan Approval requires General Electric to continue toprovide bimonthly reports, which began on September 1, 1986 to the DEQEwhich update progress made toward converting to low/no VOC coatings. Thesereports must include any communications General Electric has with DoD,EPA, suppliers, contractors, manufacturers, etc. regarding low/no conversion.Further, the Plann Approval requires that these reports include a listof currenct coatings and the respective ratio of VOC to solids as applied,availability of low/no VOC substitutes, coating trials and results, expecteddates of conversion, and final conversion dates.Plastics Business Group1. The proposed Plan Approval requires that General Electric install acarbon absorber by December 31, 1986 to control methylene chloride emissionsfrom the condenser stack serving the laminating resins manufacturing operation.The Plan Approval specifies that the carbon adsorber be operated so that,minimally, a 90% recovery efficiency and a 90% system capture efficiencyare achieved. Overall, an 81% capture and recovery efficiency (0.9andmultiply;0.9=81%)must be achieved.2. The proposed Plan Approval requires General Electric to install inletand outlet test ports on the carbon absorber by December 31, 1986 whichwill allow for VOC emission testing according to EPA Reference Test Method18 or 25A as contained in Appendix A of 40 CFR Part 60. The Plan Approvalfurther specifies that General Electric will be required to test at thediscretion of DEQE of EPA.3. The Plan Approval requires that General Electric develop and implementa Leak Detection and Repair Program for controlling VOC emissions fromthe Plastics Business Group's manufacturing operations. A DEQE-approvedLeak Detection and Repair Program shall be implemented by September 1,1986 for the laminating resins operations of control methylene chlorideemissions and by December 15, 1986 for the remainder of the Plastics BusinessGroup's operations.4. The Plan Approval requires that General Electric discontinue the manufactureof METHYLON resins no later than December 31, 1986.<ITAG tagnum="84">EPA's Evaluation of DEQE RACT Determination</ITAG>EPA has reviewed the proposed Plan Approval and supporting documents submittedas a SIP revision for parallel processing. EPA generally agrees with theDEQE RACT requirements to reduce VOC emissions from General Electric. However,EPA is requiring the DEQE to address the items identified below in thefinal, formal SIP revision submitted to impose RACT on General Electricto provide additional documentation to ensure that the RACT requirementsare technically supportable and enforceable.1. Standard operating procedures for the front panel cover and pot lidon the Large Transformer Group's Gasket Dipping/Drying operations mustbe required and made part of the Plan Approval to insure that the 50% reductionwill be achieved and maintained.2. The Leak Detection and Repair Program for controlling VOCs from thePlastic Business Group's manufacturing operations must specify a schedulefor requiring monitoring of leaks that can only be repaired when the unitis shutdown.3. The Plan Approval states that, as of December 31, 1987, General Electricmay not exceed the current VOC content(s) of its applicable, existing DoD-specifiedcoatings (an attachment to the Plan Approval provides the current VOC contentof each existing coating in pounds of VOC per gallon of solids applied).The Plan Approval further requires that General Electric's DoD-specifiedcoatings must all meet an emission rate of 6.68 pounds of VOC per gallonof solids as applied no later than December 31, 1991. In effect, DEQE hasdetermined RACT for General Electric's DoD-specified coatings as theircurrent VOC content(s) in pounds of VOC per gallon of solids applied. EPAhas conferred with DoD, and that Agency provided information indicatingthat manufacturers of their ordnance equipment could comply with the useof low/no formulated coatings by December 31, 1987. Therefore, the DEQE'ssubmittal must contain further justification for determining the currentVOC content(s) of their DoD-specified coatings as RACT. Otherwise, DEQEmust amend the Plan Approval to require General Electric to use DoD-specifiedcoatings which meet 6.68 pounds VOC per gallon of solids applied by December31, 1987.4. The Plan Approval should require that the 8.3 TPY annual total VOC emissionlimitation, imposed on the Ordnance Systems Division RACT-subject painting/coatingsoperations, must be met over every consecutive twelve (12) month time period.The Plan Approval should clarify the final compliance date for this annuallimit.5. The Plan Approval must specifically require that the emission rate of6.68 pounds of VOC per gallon of solids as applied be met on a continuousbasis. This will prevent General Electric from using an emissions bubbleto meet this emission rate until and unless the company is approved todo so.These amendments to the Plan Approval must be addressed in the versionof that document which is formally submitted as a revision to EPA for finalapproval and incorporation into the SIP. EPA is proposing to approve thisSIP revision for General Electric in Pittsfield, which was submitted onFebruary 4, 1988, if the DEQE makes the changes specified in this notice.EPA is soliciting public comments on the issues discussed in this noticeor on other relevant matters. These comments will be considered beforetaking final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federalrulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to the EPA Regionaloffice listed in the <T3>Addresses </T3>section of this notice.This revision is being proposed under a procedure called parallel processing,whereby EPA proposes rulemaking action concurrently with the state's proceduresfor amending its regulations. If the proposed revision is substantiallychanged in areas other than those identified in this notice, EPA will evaluatethose changes and may publish another notice of proposed rulemaking. Ifno substantial changes are made other than those areas cited in this notice,EPA will publish a Final Rulemaking Notice on the revisions. The finalrulemaking action by EPA will occur only after the SIP revision has beenadopted by Massachusetts and submitted formally to EPA for incorporationinto the SIP.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action</ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve the DEQE's proposed RACT determination as imposedin the January 21, 1988 Conditional Plan Approval (Amended). EPA is proposingapproval with the understanding that the DEQE's formal SIP revision submittalwill adequately address the items indicated in this notice.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709.)The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof Section 3 of Executive Order 12291.The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove the SIP revisionwill be based on whether it meets the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(A)-(K)and 110(a)(3) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA regulations in40 CFR part 51.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Hydrocarbons, Intergovernmental relations, Ozone,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: September 29, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Michael R.
