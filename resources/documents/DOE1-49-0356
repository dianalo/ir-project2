Why? In any classical genetic-mappingstudy (breeding or somatic cell hybridization) two characteristics mustbe present with respect to the genetic loci being studied. They musthave different identifiable alleles (polymorphism), and alleles mustsegregate. Limited polymorphism and/or lack of segregation has inhibitedboth breeding studies and somatic cell hybridization studies aimed atidentifying the chromosomal location of genetic loci in the Chinese hamster.These problems are detailed below.</TEXT></DOC>
