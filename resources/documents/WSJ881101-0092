Bishop (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GNE G.HFA ABT BECHY UPJ CRIC GENI SQB CNTO </CO><IN> PHA </IN><TEXT>   A new way of dissolving the blood clots that cause heart attacks is under development.    The new method is based on a specially designed monoclonal antibody that activates clot-dissolving chemicals only at the site of a blood clot. In theory, the new technique should dissolve blood clots with less risk of bleeding occurring in other parts of the body, as can happen with current clot dissolvers. It also would reduce or even eliminate the use of manufactured clot dissolvers, utilizing instead clot-dissolving substances naturally present in the body.    The new concept hasn't yet been tried in humans, but its appearance on the research horizon throws a new element into the already furious competition among drug and biotechnology companies selling or developing clot-dissolving chemicals. These companies include Genentech Inc.; Hoechst AG, of West Germany; Abbott Laboratories, Beecham Group PLC., of England, and its U.S. partner, Upjohn Co.; Collaborative Research Inc.; and Genetics Institute Inc.    Research on the new clot-busting concept was described by Edgar Haber, the new president of the Squibb Institute for Medical Research, at a symposium in Princeton, N.J., celebrating the institute's 50th anniversary. The institute is Squibb Corp.'s basic research arm.    The new technique was initially developed in Dr. Haber's laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston, where he was head of cardiology and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School before moving to the Squibb institute in January. The research effort is continuing at Massachusetts General and will remain there, Dr. Haber said. He said the backing of a major pharmaceutical company would be needed to bring the new approach to clinical trials, but he declined to say whether any tie-ups with Squibb or any other company were in the offing. Any marketable product would be a few years away, at the earliest.    Dr. Haber said, however, that &quot;this general area {of clot-dissolving research} is one that I'll be starting up&quot; at Squibb as soon as he has the time.    Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-produced versions of the antibodies the body produces to fight off invasions of &quot;foreign&quot; proteins like viruses. The laboratory-made antibodies can be designed to &quot;home in&quot; on any particular protein. For example, a predecessor to the new clot-dissolving technique was a monoclonal antibody that homed in on the protein, fibrin, which is the key component of blood clots.    Dr. Haber's basic strategy is to take the antibody that homes in on fibrin and use it to concentrate a natural clot dissolver directly on the clot. One major natural clot dissolver is known as tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA. TPA activates plasminogen, which ordinarily lies latent in the blood. Once activated, plasminogen triggers a chemical chain reaction that destroys fibrin and thus dissolves the blood clot. Current artificially produced versions of the clot dissolvers are infused into the blood stream where they promote a freer flow of blood throughout the body. But that is done at the risk of causing hemorrhaging, something that should be avoided by the antibody, which triggers the clot-dissolving reaction only in the vicinity of the clot.    In one approach, Dr. Haber explained, researchers are combining the antibody that binds to fibrin with the part of TPA that activates the clot-dissolving reaction. In the test tube, these engineered proteins &quot;showed increased potency and selectivity in thrombolysis {dissolving clots} in comparison to natural plasminogen activators,&quot; the scientist said.    In a second approach, the researchers are fusing two antibodies together. One end of the fused antibody homes in on fibrin while the other end grabs plasminogen activator from the blood, triggering the clot-dissolving reaction at the site of the clot. The fused antibody might make it possible to use only small doses of manufactured TPA in a patient or else eliminate it altogether, Dr. Haber said. &quot;It is as yet uncertain as to which of these methods will prove most useful clinically,&quot; the researcher said.    Dr. Haber's antibody-derived attack on blood clots is different from a monoclonal antibody developed by Centocor Inc. -- and which received considerable publicity a couple of weeks ago. The Centocor monoclonal antibody is designed to prevent blood cells from clumping together to form clots. The Centocor antibody made headlines in mid-October because university and company researchers tested its effectiveness in the body of a 78-year-old man soon after he had died of a stroke.    A Centocor scientist, Harvey J. Berger, said laboratory and animal experiments show that the dosage of manufactured TPA can be lowered by 75% if the clot dissolver and the antibody are used together. The lower dosage of TPA may reduce the risk of hemorrhaging, Dr. Berger said. Clinical trials of the antibody-plus-TPA approach will get under way &quot;soon,&quot; he added.
