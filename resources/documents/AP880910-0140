Residents in Nablus said the stabbing victim, 35-year-old AthadAbu Ghosh, may have been killed by fellow Arabs for allegedlycollaborating with Israeli authorities.   His death early Saturday brought to 262 the number ofPalestinians killed since the uprising began Dec. 8 in the occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel seized from Jordan and Egyptin the 1967 Middle East war. Five Israelis also have been slain.   In Gaza City, one Palestinian was killed and three were woundedSaturday when a bomb was thrown at their car, the army said. Itreported the attack involved a feud between families and was notlinked to the anti-Israeli uprising.   Arab reports identified the slain man as Hassan Ayad, 20, andsaid reasons for the attack were unclear.   Hospital officials said Israeli troops firing regular bulletswounded four Palestinians in clashes in and around Nablus and atleast 10 other Arabs were injured by rubber bullets and beatings.   They said a 12-year-old boy was struck in the eye by a rubberbullet and was in critical condition.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin vowed to crush the uprising in aNew Year's message to soldiers Saturday. The Jewish New Year, orRosh Hashana, starts Sunday afternoon.   ``We shall repel this wave of violence,'' Rabin said. ``We shallact to calm down the (occupied) territories and allow peace talksto take place.''   An army official confirmed the stabbing death of Abu Ghosh andindicated it was one of the reasons for the indefinite curfew onNablus, the West Bank's biggest city.   ``But the army has several reasons for imposing the curfew,'' hesaid, speaking on condition of anonymity. He declined to elaborate.   Parts of the city, where 125,000 Palestinians live, were undercurfew while other areas were declared closed military zones, hesaid. Curfews keep people off the streets, and declaration of amilitary zone prevents movement in and out of a particularneighborhood.   The army said it also imposed a curfew on the nearby refugeecamp of Balata, home to some 12,000 Palestinians.   An official at Nablus' Ittihad Hospital said the facilitytreated four Palestinians age 16 to 20 who were shot and woundedSaturday in clashes with Israeli troops in Nablus and the nearbyvillage of Tel.   A 20-year-old wounded in the abdomen was in serious condition,while the others were wounded in the stomach, face and leg,respectively, he said.   The Ittihad Hospital official, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said town residents were afraid that in imposing thecurfew ``the army is going to do the same thing as they did inQalqilya.''   Qalqilya, a West Bank town of 25,000, has been under curfew forfive days as soldiers conduct house-to-house searches and makearrests. At least 200 suspected Palestinian activists have beendetained in the largest military operation since the start of theArab uprising.   A similar raid was conducted Friday in the West Bank village ofKfar Malik. The army surrounded the village at dawn and arrested 25Palestinians suspected of anti-Israeli activities, Arab witnessessaid.   On Saturday, villagers in Kfar Malik raised a dozen outlawedPalestinian flags and painted new anti-Israeli slogans on the wallsto replace those whitewashed during the army raid, said an Arabreporter who visited the village.   In southern Lebanon, Israeli troops captured four guerrillasafter seriously wounding one of them in a brief firefight Saturday,the Israeli military command said. There were no Israelicasualites, the army said.   It said an Israeli army patrol spotted the four guerrillas inthe central sector of Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone'' insouthern Lebanon and attacked the squad.   Israel Television said the guerrillas were apparently on theirway to carry out an attack in the security zone, a six-to-10 milewide buffer area along the border.</TEXT></DOC>
