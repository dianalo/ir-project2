The Commerce Department said that sales dropped to a seasonallyadjusted annual rate of 535,000 units. It was the third consecutivemonthly decline and left sales 26 percent below where they were ayear ago.   The January decline followed decreases of 6.8 percent inDecember and 3.4 percent in November as the housing industrycontinued to be the sector of the economy that has been hardest hitsince the October collapse of stock prices.   Consumers, worried about the future following the record508-point drop in stock prices, stopped looking for new homes,analysts believe.   Housing is often the economic sector which turns down firstbefore the start of a new recession. But despite the weakness inrecent months, many economists remain hopeful that recent declinesin mortgage rates will spur a rebound in sales and construction inthe months ahead.   If the rebound doesn't occur, then concerns about a possiblerecession this year could increase.   In another weak economic report, the government said today thatorders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods fell 0.6 percent inJanuary, the first decline since a 1.4 percent drop last August.   However, analysts said the January setback was not as weak as itappeared because it mainly reflected a huge swing in orders foraircraft, which had helped push factory orders up 2 percent inDecember.   The 9 percent decline in new home sales in January was thesteppest decline since a 10.9 percent drop last May. It left salesat the lowest annual rate since December 1982, when the lastrecession was ending.   The big sales decline was accompanied by a sharp rise in prices,with the median, or mid-point price of a home climbing 9.7 percentto $120,000.   The average price of a home rose to $149,000, up 10.5 percentfrom December. Economists said such a big price surge is notuncommon during a period of falling sales because fewer, buthigher-priced homes skew the averages.   The sales decline was led by a 24.4 percent drop in sales in theSouth. Sales were down 13.7 percent in the Midwest. Sales actuallyrose 23 percent in the Northeast, a rebound from a 52.9 percentdrop the month before. Sales were up 0.6 percent in the West.</TEXT></DOC>
