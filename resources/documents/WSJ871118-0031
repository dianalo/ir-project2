The greatest economic danger of the moment is that congressional leaders will be so transfixed by the 1930s that they will repeat its worst mistakes.    Dread of another Depression could create a public-policy disaster not only because it makes a false analogy to the present but because the Depression itself is so widely misread. New Deal historians are divided between Roosevelt liberals and Marxists, who debate whether FDR was the closet savior of capitalism. In the meantime, students can go through an entire course without a whisper about tax policy. Yet the calamitous impulse to raise taxes did as much as anything to prolong the economic stagnation of the '30s.    The Depression wasn't just one long slump, as the popular image has it, but a series of recoveries aborted by further recessions. These slumps within the Slump, in 1933 and 1938, were both preceded by large income-tax increases. This folly has not passed unnoticed by Keynesians. Herbert Stein exclaimed, in his 1969 book &quot;The Fiscal Revolution in America&quot;:    &quot;One can ask about the Revenue Act of 1935 the same astonished question that is asked about Hoover's Revenue Act of 1932. How can a government facing massive unemployment and spending large amounts of federal money to provide jobs for the unemployed justify raising taxes and draining more funds from the private income stream?&quot;    Mr. Stein, the old demand-sider, lambastes President Roosevelt's 1935 and 1937 tax increases:    &quot;The raising of taxes, a step certainly not required by an expansive fiscal policy, made expansive policy more dangerous and less effective and probably limited the extent to which it was followed.&quot;    Mr. Stein may be a lonely voice amid the ruck of New Deal historians, who generally ignore the tax issue. But the voters at the beginning of the Depression raised loud and angry protests to the rising tax burden. This pressure fell hardest on state and local levies, and above all on the property tax. In 1932, property taxation around the country raised $4.5 billion, 10 times the receipts from the federal income tax. So tax protests hit at city halls and state constitutions rather than at Washington. But that is no excuse for today's historians to overlook such a major movement.    In the spring of 1932, New York Times columnist Anne O'Hare McCormick wrote: &quot;Wherever you go you run into mass meetings called to protest against taxes. Opposition has seldom been so spontaneous, so universal, so determined. The nearest thing to a political revolution in the country is the tax revolt.&quot;    In Chicago, the local real estate agents organized a noisy property-tax strike hotly opposed by local bankers and civic leaders. The late Howard Jarvis, hero of California's Proposition 13, remembered speaking at a rally on behalf of the tax strikers. These protesters weren't the reactionary speculators that their opponents made them out to be. David Beito of George Mason University's Institute for Humane Studies, in a recent unpublished doctoral thesis that is one of the first studies of this movement, says it included an above-average number of skilled blue-collar workers and small proprietors.    Protests flared in other blue-collar centers. In May 1933, crowds gathered at the State Capitol when Ohio's governor proposed a sales tax and graduated income tax. The measure was dead by June. That November, voters pushed through a constitutional initiative cutting the local property tax. Michigan protesters forced through a property-tax limit of their own the year before. By the mid-1930s, some 20 states had voted some form of tax limit.    These protests shaped national policy, with ironic results. In early 1932, President Hoover tried to cope with his mounting budget deficit by proposing a national sales tax. John Nance Garner, a conservative Texas Democrat, had just been elected speaker by the new Democratic majority in the House, and his leadership circle supported the president's plan.    But when the bill hit the House floor, a coalition of Jeffersonian southern Democrats and progressive Republicans rose against party leaders. In a riotous session on March 24, writes historian Jordan A. Schwarz, the bill went down to defeat, 223 to 153, &quot;amid rebel yells and whistling.&quot;    Most of the insurgents, however, still held to the orthodoxy of a balanced budget. After the rout, Speaker Garner took to the floor for a &quot;camp meeting&quot; speech. &quot;The country at this time is in a condition where the worst taxes you could possibly levy would be better than no taxes at all,&quot; he claimed. He exhorted all who believed in a balanced budget to rise from their seats. Everyone in the House stood up.    The unfortunate alternative to the sales tax was a steep increase in the income tax. It had already won test votes in the sales-tax battle. The final version of the Revenue Act of 1932 boosted the top effective income-tax rate to 57% from 23%.    Paradoxically, much of the anti-sales-tax vote, and hence support for the increased income tax, was what one columnist called &quot;an expression of extreme conservatism,&quot; part of a &quot;nationwide rebellion . . . against . . . taxes on lands, goods and other 'tangibles.'&quot; As in the earlier Grange movement, this push for the income tax came heavily from property-rich, capital-poor protesters trying to ease their own tax burden.    But the Revenue Act was a disaster, no matter what the motives that shaped it. The economy had actually begun to recover in mid-1932. The decline in personal income slowed. Industrial output turned up, spiking in early 1933 to the level of the mid-'20s. Then the bottom dropped out. The nationwide banking crisis hit in February, as President Hoover ended his lame-duck agony. FDR began his term by declaring a bank holiday, and the &quot;Roosevelt recession&quot; was in free fall.    As national income fell to less than half 1929's level, the income-tax collections were doomed. Although the top individual rates had doubled, collections in fiscal 1933 fell 17%.    President Roosevelt's recovery policy stands as an even bigger monument to the futility of tax increases. Even as the New Deal's homeowner loans and local subsidies calmed the property-tax revolt, its &quot;soak the rich&quot; income-tax rates dampened economic initiative. Not only were tax bills in 1935 and 1936 directed against &quot;the wealthy&quot; and against business profits, the introduction of Social Security in 1936 imposed a heavy &quot;regressive&quot; tax on the working population.    Throughout the '30s, President Roosevelt's advisers worried about the &quot;lack of business confidence.&quot; This intangible had a practical aspect that can be directly traced to the tax increases. Although by 1937 total real output had returned to the level of 1929, Mr. Stein observes, private investment remained one-third lower. Even this recovery was lost in 1938, when GNP fell 6.4%. The top income-tax rate had risen to 68%; individual income-tax collections in fiscal 1939 fell 20%.    In light of this history, it's positively eerie to hear politicians use the fear of a new depression to justify a tax increase. As someone once said, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.    ---   Mr. Adams, formerly of the Journal's editorial board, is author of the 1984 book &quot;Secrets of the Tax Revolt.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;Panic Isn't Same as Bank Crisis&quot; -- WSJ Nov. 17, 1987) </TEXT></DOC>
