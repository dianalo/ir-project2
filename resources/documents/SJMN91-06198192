Sources saidthe leaders also urged Israel to stop sending Jewish settlers into the WestBank and to Gaza, and appealed to the Arabs to end their economic boycott ofIsrael.;    Bush provided no details of Syria's latest position, especiallywhether Assad was still insisting on United Nations participation in peacetalks over Israel's objections.;    But, he said, &quot;it's a very important stepthat has taken place.&quot;;    Referring to Assad, a hard-line Arab leader whosecountry has participated in every Middle East war against Israel, thepresident said: &quot;He's just agreed now to come forward to the kinds of meetingsthat are necessary to get this process going. And that is a major step if itproves to be correct.&quot;;    Clearly putting pressure on Israel to fall in line,Bush added: &quot;I would like to think that when they say that they want peacethey would get on board naturally. They've been wanting talks with people inthe area, and if all goes well here, that's exactly what will happen.&quot;;   Bush said of the Assad response: &quot;We're not suggesting everything is fine andthat there couldn't be some last-minute hitch to it. But we're approachingthis very positively.&quot;;    The trip will be Baker's fifth to the region thisyear, but Bush appeared optimistic about the mission that begins Thursday inSyria. &quot;I have asked Jim Baker to go back to the area to immediately follow upwhat we would term a breakthrough from what we know about it,&quot; he said.;   Even so, Bush offered no prediction that Baker could bridge the gap betweenAssad and Israelis dubious that Syria was ready for peace after more than fourdecades of enmity.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  London  </CITY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910716  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  421  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday July 16, 199100198192,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
