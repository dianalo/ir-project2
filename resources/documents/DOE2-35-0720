It is further shown that the consideration of the effect ofthe thickness of the thermal boundary layer on the activation conditionsof vapor formation centers makes it possible to explain changes in thetemperature head corresponding to the onset of boiling on surfaces withporous coatings in comparison with smooth surfaces. 46 references.</TEXT></DOC>
