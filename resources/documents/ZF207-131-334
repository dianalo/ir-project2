says Gary Ragsdale,assistant vice president and chief engineer of Federal Express'sInternational Transmission Corp., Memphis.andP;  To telecom professionals 1984conjures up not just Orwellian fantasies, but the divestiture of ATandamp;T.andM;Liberalization and even privatization of telephone monopolies is under way insome of the more wealthy Pacific nations.andP;  That's because once monopoliesmeet their number-one requirement of providing basic telephone needs,competition is often the next step.andP;  This is happening most notably in Japanand New Zealand, and to lesser extents in Australia, Hong Kong, and Korea.andM;Be sure, though, not to call these processes deregulation.andP;  As we've seen inthe U.S., changes in the monopolistic telephone structure don't mean adecrease in government intervention.andP;  It's simply that the rules change andmore players take the field.andM;Along with regulatory changes, technology is playing an important part in thedevelopment of Asia/Pacific communications.andP;  The international communicationsmarket is driving toward standards such as the Open Systems Interconnection(OSI) model and ISDN that will provide common denominators across boundaries.andO;Also a plus are optical fiber submarine cable systems now in development, andwhich, for the first time, will provide a full-scale digital trans-Pacifictransmission system.andP;  Users should benefit from more bandwidth at cheaperprices.andM;As in other parts of the world, one of the most hotly contested new marketsin the Pacific region is expected to be value-added networks.andP;  A VAN is atelecommunications network that offers enhanced services such as protocolconversion, electronic mail, or more advanced industry-specific applications.andO;Carriers and computer companies are lining up to take advantage of the recentchanges that are giving VANs the go-ahead.andM;Along with the new services, users should also soon start to reap thebenefits of more options in equipment and maintenance suppliers in severalPacific nations.andP;  Until now, those wishing to send data to the Pacific had tochoose between leasing private lines or going through the local PTTs withtheir particular list of restrictions.andM;While users currently are not placing much emphasis on public data networks,that will change, according to a study of user and service companies involvedwith Asia/Pacific.andP;  The study, recently completed by Input, a Mountain View,Calif.-based research firm, found that 76% of those surveyed expect increasedemphasis on these types of services.andP;  (Changes may also occur in userorganizations, see &quot;Decentralized Telecom Decisions.&quot;)  When asked to rankthe reasons for their interest in public data networks, the top threeresponses were:andM;* to access a corporate system/database;andM;* to find an alternative to leased circuits; andandM;* to run specific applications, namely, electronic mail and electronic datainterchange (EDI).andM;Interest was also shown in using public networks as backups to otherinternational corporate networks.andM;VANs are most likely to affect corporations with small- to medium-sizedvolumes of overseas business, rather than major data traffickers likefinancial services companies.andP;  The latter typically have in place extensiveprivate networks that are so crucial to the way they do business that theywill not give them up.andM;Likewise, if security is an issue, don't expect users to forgo their privatenetworks.andP;  The U.S.andP;  Defense Communications Agency leases 80% of its voicelines worldwide, but data lines are all private.andP;  &quot;We're going to stayprivate since often the message addresses themselves are classified,&quot; saysone of the agency's telecom experts.andM;Attractive VANsandM;But if your business isn't top secret, VANs start looking attractive,according to IS and telecom professionals.andM;Federal Express, which is even beginning to offer its own data switchservice, sees new value in public networks, according to Ragsdale.andP;  &quot;Part ofit is logistics,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;The time and cost of building your owninfrastructure make you look at public networks.&quot;andM;Nowhere is this interest in VANs more likely to be tested than in Japan.andP;  In1985, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) was privatized and the principleof competition was introduced.andP;  Since then, licenses have been granted to 39&quot;Type I&quot; carriers (those possessing their own circuit facilities).andP;  Nearly600 &quot;Type II&quot; carriers have started operations.andP;  These Type II companiesutilize Type I facilities.andM;Domestic VANs in Japan have been operational since 1985, when IBM Japanbecame the first to offer the service.andP;  International VANs began to belicensed in 1988, and seven services have gotten under way between Japan andthe U.S.andP;  The progress is much slower elsewhere.andP;  Korea, for example, hasallowed only domestic VANs since last December.andM;&quot;We want one network worldwide that can handle electronic mail,&quot; says the MISvice president of an American pharmaceuticals manufacturer, who like manyothers asked that neither he nor his company be identified.andP;  This company islooking at new public network offerings that could satisfy its need fore-mail.andM;Currently the pharmaceuticals maker has a joint venture based in Japan andmarketing offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia.andP;  Because none ofthe data is viewed as time- or mission-critical, this supplier faxesinformation to Asia where it is then rekeyed.andM;This is one type of customer that leading network providers such as TymnetMcDonnell Douglas Network Systems Co., San Jose, hope to serve.andP;  PreviouslyTymnet was limited in Japan to private network services.andP;  &quot;Almost all myprivate network customers are financial companies, so the changes don'taffect them much,&quot; says Gary Gardina, Tymnet's business manager for networksin the Pacific region.andP;  &quot;It does open up opportunities for others who maywant to, let's say, talk to their Far East manufacturing facilities.&quot;andM;One large American-based industrial is looking into its options now for justthat.andP;  With manufacturing facilities in Japan, Korea, and Australia, it'sbeen using a combination of public and private networks.andP;  High costs havebeen a factor in keeping down its data traffic to the Pacific Rim.andP;  &quot;We'rewatching closely, and when [VANs] can demonstrate reliability, we'll considerthem,&quot; says the company's telecom manager.andP;  But VANs would most likelyaugment his present network scenario, not replace anything that'soperational.andM;That wait-and-see attitude is common and perhaps wise.andP;  &quot;We tend to wait,based on bitter experience,&quot; says a financial services telecom executive.andO;&quot;You never go with an inexperienced operator.&quot;andM;Nonetheless, there are values to be gained from VANs.andP;  Proprietary protocolsupport is one of them.andP;  Federal Express needs to connect PCs to packetnetworks but wants error correction.andP;  Previously it required private networksto do this.andP;  &quot;Now public networks look more attractive with the newservices,&quot; says Ragsdale.andM;Sometimes this protocol support comes at the expense of good will.andP;  Apolitical battle erupted between the U.S.andP;  and Japan last year when Japanwanted to ensure that only international standards such as X.400 and X.75 beused, much to the displeasure of large American companies like IBM.andP;  Thecompromise reached last October was that Japan will allow international VANproviders to use proprietary protocols if they intend to be technicallycapable of interconnecting with other IVAN providers.andM;These regulatory battles may crop up elsewhere.andP;  In Hong Kong a new form oflicense has been created, granted by the telecom authority for value-addedservices.andP;  The government is even supporting a study on electronic datainterchange (EDI).andP;  &quot;Do we insist on protocols, and if so, how far down theline?&quot; asks Anthony Wong, assistant postmaster general of the Hong Kong PostOffice.andP;  That's still to be determined, he notes.andM;Hong Kong Considered the NormandM;Hong Kong is a good example of what may be considered the norm.andP;  The domesticpublic data network is controlled by the monopoly Hong KongTelecommunications.andP;  International VAN services don't exist, and allinternational circuits must be supplied by Cable and Wireless.andP;  What makesHong Kong different, though, is that the telephone franchise expires in 1995and a decision may be made as soon as next year as to whether it will remaina monopoly.andP;  &quot;Since Hong Kong is a financial center, we feel the pressure&quot; tointroduce competition, according to Wong.andM;This may be news to users, who frequently complain that they have nobargaining power with foreign telecom authorities.andP;  That situation may beslowly changing with the liberalization efforts.andM;It is not unusual to hear stories of corporations smuggling in equipment thatis considered illegal; in some cases even multiplexers are not allowed bylocal PTTs.andP;  Liberalization of supplier and equipment regulations may makeuser operations easier, if a little less exciting.andM;In those countries that have not gone so far as to privatize the oldmonopolies, equipment restrictions have already been eased.andP;  In 1983 HongKong deregulated customer premises equipment.andP;  Australia is in the process ofopening up the market now for CPE and maintenance, and it has authorized aunit to hear user concerns and complaints.andM;Under a decision made last year, the Australian government will set up a newregulatory body, Austel, with the authority to decide what equipment may beattached to the public telecommunications network.andP;  Previously, the domesticcarrier monopoly Telecom had final say over how it should run the network andits operations.andM;That's all well and good, but there's room for more action.andP;  Tony Staley,chairman of the Australian Telecommunications Users Group (ATUG), says, &quot;Weare seeking to remove Telecom's authority on everything but voice.andP;  We alsobelieve that Aussat should be allowed to provide public data switchednetworks.&quot;andP;  Aussat provides Australian satellite communications and is ownedin part by Telecom.andP;  Aussat and Telecom provide domestic communications forAustralia while OTC (Overseas Telecommunictions Commission) is theinternational carrier.andP;  The tree are protected monopolies.andM;It's important to remember that it's still very early in the game.andP;  Manynations haven't gotten much beyond considering the idea of change.andP;  &quot;Wehaven't seen many signs of liberalization yet,&quot; says a top Reuters Ltd.andO;executive who asked that his name not be used.andP;  &quot;The carriers should belistening to people like us who reprsent a large portion of their revenue.andO;It's still monopolistic but i think that we'l start seeing changes.&quot;andM;Any easing of restrictions is welcomed by companies large or small.andP;  One ofthe best examples of large operations is Reuters, probably the world'slargest private user of leased circuits.andP;  Annually, Reuters spends $11million in Asia on circuits alone.andP;  It now has in excess of 165,000 terminalsin more than 100 countries.andP;  The Reuters data network can support 200stock-price channels per second; and the company anticipates that in fiveyears the number will jump to 1,000.andP;  The aim is to move a piece of dataanywhere across the world in one second.andM;Some positive changes in the way of proposed 20% tariff reductions in Japanare occurring, but restrictions are still plentiful.andP;  When Reuters recentlywanted a simplex broadcast netwrok between Hong Kong and Tokyo, the Japanesecarrier Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co.andP;  Ltd. (KDD) said it would provide onlyduplex.andP;  Yet hassles are not unique to Asia.andP;  It took Reuters almost fourmonths to establish a wide-band circuit between New York and Tokyo.andO;Eventually it was discovered the delay was due to problems in New York.andM;Reuters will not switch from its own network.andP;  &quot;Our service is veryspecialized and very fast,&quot; claims the Reuters executive.andP;  &quot;Private packetnetworks don't hack it.&quot;andP;  Generally, packet data networks are not suited toeither very short transactions, such as credit card verification messages, orlarge file transfers, which tend to be expensive.andM;While others could and are planning to benefit from new network services, thenext few years will bring some of the same problems in the Asia/Pacificregion that the U.S.andP;  experienced when ATandamp;T was divested.andP;  Monopolies canconstrain demand.andP;  When things open up, sometimes the infrastructure isn'timmediately prepared to handle expansion.andP;  For example, one common problemthat companies report is an inability to satisfy circuit orders in Japan.andM;Something that may help is the growing sophistication of telecom managers indealing with foreign suppliers.andP;  &quot;Some changes are a result of our businesspeople within telecom becoming more adept at doing business,&quot; says Input's J.andO;Alex Graham.andP;  &quot;Also, some regulators are easing up and the PTTs areincreasingly amenable to meeting [user] needs.&quot;andM;What it smounts to is give-and-take, according to ATUG's Staley.andP;  &quot;Life isoften a case of slap and tickel,&quot; he chuckles.andM;PTT ParticularsandM;If you're the type who cried when they broke up Ma Bell, you'd better get outa fresh hankie.andP;  While most of the changes in the Asia/Pacific region aren'tnearly as dramatic, there is a steady evolution toward telecommunicationsliberalization.andP;  Here are some of the details.andM;* Japan: In 1985, when Nippon Telephone and Telegraph was privatized, a newera began.andP;  There are 39 companies licensed as carriers and almost 600companies that are called carriers but do not own their own circuitfacilities.andP;  Domestic VAN services have been allowed since 1985 andinternational VANs since 1988.andP;  Nevertheless, NTT is still the vastlydominant carrier in Japan.andP;  &quot;Fair competition does not exist,&quot; charges MasaoYukawa, general manager of Mitsubishi Corp., Tokyo, where he headstelecommunications strategic planning.andM;Further actions are being taken against NTT.andP;  Among them, NTT is being askedto disclose the breakdown of its traffic volumes and cost structures as wellas to disclose all its interface conditions and protocols.andP;  Additionally, NTTis up for a review next year and recent scandals may promote the monolith'sbreakup.andM;* Australia: The Australian telecommunications monopoly remains intact, withservices divided among Telecom and Aussat (for domestic service) and OTC(international).andM;On May 25, 1988, a ministerial statement was released opening some areas toprivate entities.andP;  Changes will go into effect starting this year.andP;  Basicservices are to remain monopolies, but certain added-value services such asvideotex will be opened to competition.andP;  Not to be touched are leasedcircuits, public switched voice and data, and ISDN servies.andP;  Certain customerpremise equipment such as PBXs have been deregulated.andP;  Most important, thegovernment deemed it inappropriate for the monopolies to regulate their ownmarkets.andP;  So this year the government will set up an independent regulatorybody, Austel, which will report to Parliament.andP;  &quot;The major change is nowthere is a place for user concerns and complaints to go to,&quot; says Australianuser group chairman Staley.andM;* New Zealand: April 1 is the deadline for total deregulation, which willextend all the way to the public switched network.andP;  Many other nations arewatching to see how New Zealand fares.andP;  As one telecom manager says, &quot;You'llsee all hell break loose.andP;  This will prove if it's better or not to do thingsin stages.&quot;andM;* Hong Kong: In the late 1970s the government agreed to start a slow processof deregulation.andP;  In essence, however, Hong Kong Telecommunications and Cableand Wireless still have monopolies on domestic and international service,respectively.andM;In 1983, customer premises equipment was deregulated.andP;  Last July, thegovernment decided to go ahead and grant a license for a second domesticnetwork, in this case a broadband cable television network (also to be usedfor data), and said the telephone company could own no more than 15%.andP;  Thetelephone franchise expires in 1995 and Hong Kong will decide perhaps as soonas next year whether to introduce competition.andM;In 1997, Hong Kong returns to Chinese control, and some companies, includingUnion Carbide, have recently moved their Asian buds from Hong Kong for thatreason.andM;* Korea: There are five operating agencies, all monopolies.andP;  Key are KTA, thepublic switched domestic and international telephone network service, andDACOM, which was set up in 1982 to provide packet switched data networks andservices, now including electronic data interchange (EDI).andP;  A recent changeallows DACOM to have its own network facilities, including fiber optic links,instead of relying on KTA.andP;  &quot;We are in the process of giving more competitionin the domestic environment,&quot; says Jun-Uck Seo, manager of the KoreaTelecommunications Authority.andM;Moves toward competition may include separating out international service.andO;This competitive spirit has not spread too far: while corporations may havein-house networks, no one is allowed to provide third-party service withoutth einvolvement of the monopolies.andM;* Thailand: Chief among the state-run organizations are the TelephoneOrganization of Thailand, which can lease lines to private users, and theCommunications Authority of Thailand.andP;  Among signs of liberalization is thatin 1987 CAT was authorized to offer VAN services such as electronic mail andvideotex public databases.andP;  Additionally, CAT will introduce a packetswitched data network this April to serve VANs.andM;The state is also looking into the possibility of privatization.andP;  &quot;As forvalue-added networks and services, it is a matter of careful reflection[before] Thailand will plunge into the flood of information,&quot; according toChao Thongma, executive director of the Asia Pacific Telecommunity, a keygroup of common carriers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
