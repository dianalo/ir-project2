GrossmanandM;As the so-called Columbus Day virus nears its critical date,computer-security experts are recommending a number of preventive measures tostop its spread.andM;To guard against the virus, which is expected to be unleashed in infectedcomputers on or around Oct.andP;  12, experts are encouraging PC users to manuallycheck new and existing .COM files for corruption and to implement specialsecurity software that protects files against the strain.andM;The virus replicates through the execution of infected .COM files found insystem utilities.andM;Imported from EuropeandM;The Columbus Day virus, also known as the Datacrime virus, is one of thefirst to target MS-DOS computers.andP;  It was reportedly unleashed a few monthsago in Europe and has recently begun to attack some PC sites in the UnitedStates.andM;The damage occurs when a contaminated program causes the virus to destroydata on a hard disk's track 0, requiring that the disk be reformatted with alow-level formatting program, experts said.andM;&quot;It's nasty and it's well-written.andP;  You need to take extraordinary measuresright now in order to stop it,&quot; warned Tom Patterson, senior analyst forsecurity operations at Centel Federal Systems Corp., a systems integrator inReston, Va.andM;To ensure that none of his company's computers are infected, Patterson hasmanually checked the length and content of every .COM file to make surethey're free of the virus strain.andM;The virus adds either 1,168 or 1,280 bytes to the files it infects, so userscan guard against contamination by checking a file's true length againsttheir original DOS master disks, computer-security experts said.andP;  The virusdoes not attack COMMAND.COM or any other .COM file whose seventh character isa &quot;D&quot;.andM;Patterson and other security experts suggest that once a particular computerhas been found to be uncontaminated, any software that is installedthereafter should first be examined on a secure system.andM;Centel is also developing software that searches disks for the Datacrimevirus' code, but Patterson warned that users should not limit theirpreventive measures to this software, since it is not designed to detectother strains.andM;Users who want to take the highest security precautions can use specialsoftware, such as Comsec-II from American Computer Security Industries Inc.andO;(ACSI), which can make all .COM files execute-only, thereby eliminating thedanger of infection.andM;Such security software can also run special &quot;checksum&quot; tests on files to makesure that they haven't been modified, according to Winn Schwartau, of ACSI inNashville, Tenn.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
