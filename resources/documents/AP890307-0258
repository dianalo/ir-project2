(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal Express Corp. will launch on April1 an overnight service that delivers documents and small packages inthe afternoon instead of midmorning at a slightly reduced rate, thecompany said Tuesday.   The new FedEx Standard Overnight service promises next-afternoondelivery for packages up to 5 pounds, arriving by 3 p.m. in mostareas or 4 p.m. in more remote locations. The current PriorityOvernight delivery program promises deliveries by 10:30 a.m. in mostlocations.   ``We saw a niche in the market for those people wanting a lowercost service for next-day delivery, but not necessarily next-morningdelivery. We already have a priority overnight service,'' spokesmanArmand Schneider said Tuesday.   For letter delivery, the company said its door-to-door list priceof from $8.25 to $11.25 would be the lowest in the industry. UnitedParcel Service, for example, charges at least $8.50 for its next-dayair service.   ``Test marketing of the new product in six cities confirmed thatmany customers who use our competitors do so when price is the primefactor,'' said Carole A. Presley, senior vice president formarketing and communications.   The door-to-door list price for packages would range from $12.50for a 1-pound package to $16.50 for a 5-pound package, the companysaid.</TEXT></DOC>
