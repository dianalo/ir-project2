<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-94-0203 </DOCNO><TEXT>In December, 1983, the Gas Research Institute (GRI), the US Departmentof Energy (DOE), 36 gas and electric utilities and an industrial participantbegan field testing onsite fuel cell power plants manufactured by InternationalFuel Cells (IFC). These 40-kW power plants were installed at 36 differentutility-selected sites throughout the USA and in Japan. A total of 42plants were installed and are being tested in a variety of building typeswith wide variations in use patterns and energy system configurations.Power plant installation and operating experiences are discussed. Fourconclusions are presented. (1) The utility participants encountered noinsurmountable problems in designing, installing, operating and maintainingthe power plants at their customers' sites. (2) The power plants metthe project's availability and electrical efficiency goals. (3) The onsitefuel cell sites represent numerous market segments and provide variedelectrical and thermal interfaces for power plant testing. (4) Operationalproblems discovered during field testing are being resolved in a technologydevelopment effort.</TEXT></DOC>
