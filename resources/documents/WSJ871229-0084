The Federal Election Commission, by a unanimous vote, declared the Colorado Democrat eligible to receive federal matching funds and instructed the Treasury Department to issue the campaign an initial check for $100,000. The former senator, who stunned the political world by reentering the presidential race earlier this month, may be eligible for nearly $1 million in federal matching funds by the end of next month.    With several hundred thousand dollars on the way, Mr. Hart will find it harder to portray his campaign as a lonely, &quot;nofrills&quot; operation -- a strategy that even prompts his aides to call reporters only on a collect basis.    But at the same time, the money means Mr. Hart will be able to project himself and his ideas in Iowa and New Hampshire, sites of critical, early winter political tests. The matching funds also will help Mr. Hart overcome one of his biggest hurdles; the commission's decision yesterday ensures that he will be awarded spots on primary ballots in some states.    The decision to grant Mr. Hart's campaign $100,000 -- to be released next Monday -- was based on the money his campaign raised before he left the Democratic race last spring following reports he spent part of a weekend with a Miami model. All the major presidential candidates but the Rev. Jesse Jackson now have qualified for the federal campaign money.    Mr. Hart, whose request for matching funds was denied after he left the race, now is eligible to apply on Jan. 11 for additional federal money. Then commission officials will examine his documentation to determine how much more he may receive.    Still unresolved is whether Mr. Hart, whose 1984 presidential campaign is still $1 million in the red, can apply his 1988 matching funds to his earlier debts.    &quot;He hasn't asked yet,&quot; said Karen Finucan, a commission spokeswoman. Mr. Hart did make such a request earlier, but the commission declared it moot because he was no longer a candidate and wasn't eligible for federal money.    The commission has approved federal payments of $25.6 million, also to be paid Monday, to the dozen presidential candidates who have qualified for matching funds. The leading recipient is Vice President George Bush, with $4.8 million. Fellow Republican Pat Robertson is to receive $4.5 million, Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas is to receive $4.3 million, and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York is to receive $3 million. The leading Democratic recipient is Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, with $2.4 million.    The matching funds are provided from a voluntary $1 checkoff on federal income-tax returns. Candidates must raise at least $5,000 in individual contributions of under $250 in at least 20 states. Individuals may contribute as much as $1,000 in the primary season, but only contributions up to $250 are matched by the Treasury. </TEXT></DOC>
