On April 29, 1987, the ERA fileda Petition for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures in connectionwith a Consent Order that it entered into with Shell Oil Company (Shell).I. Background Shell is a major integrated refiner which produced and sold crude oil anda full range of refined petroleum products during the period of federalprice controls. The firm was therefore subject to the Mandatory PetroleumPrice Regulations set forth at 6 CFR Part 150 and 10 CFR Parts 210, 211,and 212. During the period of federal controls, the ERA conducted an extensiveaudit of Shell's operations and, as a result of the audit, alleged thatShell had violated certain applicable DOE price and allocation regulationsin its sales of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Settlement discussionswere held, and on March 26, 1987, the ERA and Shell finalized a ConsentOrder (Consent Order No. RSHA00001Z) that resolved disputes regarding Shell'scrude oil and refined petroleum product operations during the period January1, 1973 through January 27, 1981 (consent order period). Pursuant to theterms of the Consent Order, Shell remitted a total of $183,667,955.78 (theconsent order fund)\1\<NOTE/> into an interest-bearing escrow account, for ultimate distributionby the DOE through Subpart V. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\This amount consists of the principal consent order amountof $180,000,000 plus $3,667,955.78 in interest which accrued prior to Shell'spayment to the DOE. For accounting purposes, the interest remitted by Shellhas been considered as additional principal and has been divided proportionatelybetween the crude oil and refined product pools discussed below. On December 10, 1987, the OHA issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDandamp;O)setting forth a tentative plan for the distribution of the Shell consentorder funds. Because the Consent Order resolves alleged violations involvingboth sales of crude oil and refined products, we proposed to divide theconsent order fund into two pools. This Decision and Order establishesprocedures for distributing the portion of those funds attributable toalleged refined product violations, consisting of $20,407,550.64 plus accruedinterest.\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\The final procedures for disbursing the Shell crude oilrefund pool, consisting of $163,260,405.14 plus accrued interest, wereset forth in Shell Oil Company, 17 DOE andpara;85,204 (1988). In order to give notice to all potentially affected parties, a copy ofthe PDandamp;O was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and comments regarding the proposed refund procedureswere solicited. 52 FR 47967 (December 17, 1987). Two interested parties,the Petroleum Marketers Association of America (PMAA) and Energy Refunds,Inc., submitted comments concerning the proposed procedures for the distributionof the Shell consent order funds pertaining to alleged refined productviolations. In this Decision and Order, we will address those commentsand adopt final procedures for the distribution of the Shell refined productfunds. II. Final Refund Procedures The procedural regulations of the DOE set forth general guidelines to beused by OHA in formulating and implementing a plan of distribution forfunds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. 10 CFR Part 205,Subpart V. The Subpart V process may be used in situations in which theDOE is unable to identify readily those persons who may have been injuredby the alleged regulatory violations or to determine the amount of suchinjuries. A more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority ofOHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds is set forth in the casesof <T3>Office of Enforcement,</T3> 9 DOE andpara;82,508 (1981); and <T3>Office of Enforcement,</T3> 8 DOE andpara;82,597 (1981) (<T3>Vickers</T3>). Pursuant to the goals of the Subpart V regulations, we will attempt toprovide refunds to claimants who demonstrate that they were injured byShell's alleged regulatory violations in its sales of refined petroleumproducts during the the January 1, 1973 through January 27, 1981 consentorder period.\3\<NOTE/> Residual funds in the Shell escrow account will be distributedin accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distributionand Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C. 4500 <T3>et seq.,</T3> 1 Fed. Energy Guidelines andpara; 11,702.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ We recognize that we may receive claims based upon Shell'salleged violation of the DOE allocation regulations. <T3>See</T3> 10 CFR Part 211. We will evaluate such claims by referringto the standards set forth in Decisions such as Office of Special Counsel,10 DOE andpara; 85,048 at 88,220 (1982) (Amoco), and OKC Corp./Town andamp;Country Markets, Inc., 12 DOE andpara; 85,094 (1984). Under those standardsan allocation claimant must: (1) demonstrate the existence of a supplier/purchaserrelationship with the consent order firm and the likelihood that the consentorder firm failed to furnish petroleum products that it was obliged tosupply to the claimant under 10 CFR Part 211; (2) provide evidence thatit had contemporaneously notified the DOE or otherwise sought redress forthe alleged allocation violation; and (3) establish that it was injuredand document the extent of the injury. The remainder of this Decision concernsonly the filing of claims involving Shell's alleged pricing violations.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Calculation of Refund Amounts</ITAG>The first step in the refund process is the calcualtion of an applicant'spotential refund. To accomplish this, we will presume that the allegedovercharges were spread evenly over all of Shell's sales of refined petroleumproducts during the consent order period. Under this volumetric presumption,a claimant's potential refund generally will be computed by multiplyingthe number of gallons of covered products that it purchased from Shellby a volumetric factor of $0.000226 per gallon.\4\<NOTE/> we derived this figure by dividing the $20,407,550.64 receivedfrom Shell and allocated to the refined product pool by the 90,334,236,000gallons of refined products subject to price and allocation controls thatShell sold during the consent order period. In addition, successful claimantswill receive proportionate shares of the interest that has accrued on theShell escrow account.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Although the Shell consent order covers the period January1, 1973 through January 27, 1981, applicants may file claims for volumespurchased only while the product in question was subject to federal pricecontrols. Therefore, claimants may apply for refunds based on purchasesmade from Shell between March 6, 1973 and the date of decontrol for eachparticular product. Below is a list of regualted petroleum products andthe dates on which they were decontrolled:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Because we realize that the impact on an individual claimantmay have been greater than its potential refund calculated using the volumetricmethodology, a claimant may submit evidence detailing the specific allegedovercharge that it sustained in order to be eligible for a larger refund.<T3>See </T3>Standard Oil Co. (Indiana)/Army and Air Force Exchange Service,12 DOE andpara; 85,015 (1984).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,xs50</C> <H1>Product</H1><H1>Decontrol date</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Motor Gasoline, Propane<D>Jan. 28, 1981.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Butane and Natural Gasoline<D>Jan. 1, 1980.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Aviation Gas and Jet fuel<D>Feb. 26, 1979.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Naphtha-Based Jet Fuel<D>Oct. 1, 1976.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Naphthas<D>Sept. 1, 1976.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzene, Toluene<D>Sept. 1, 1976.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Diesel Fuel, Kerosene<D>July 1, 1976.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">No. 1 and No. 2 Heating Oil<D>July 1, 1976.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Residual Fuel<D>June 1, 1976.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ethane and Asphalt<D>Apr. 1, 1974.</D></ITAG></ITAG>We generally require claimants to submit monthly purchase schedules inorder to establish their total purchase volumes from a consent order firm.In its comments, the PMAA suggests that, instead, we allow all refund applicantsto submit yearly schedules of their purchase volumes of Shell covered products.We are not persuaded that this would be appropriate. An annual schedulecan mask certain factors, such as seasonal purchase patterns, which helpus to ascertain the accuracy of an applicant's submission. Therefore, wewill accept annual purchase volume data only if it is accompanied by adequatesupporting documentation, such as a computer printout of purchases fromShell provided by OHA.As in previous cases, only claims for at least $15 in principal will beprocessed. This minimum has been adopted in refined product refund proceedingsbecause the cost of processing claims for refunds of less than $15 outweighsthe benefits of restitution in those instances. <T3>See, e.g., Mobil Oil Corp.</T3>, 13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985).<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Determination of Injury</ITAG>Once a claimant's potential refund has been calculated, we must determinewhether the claimant was injured by its purchases from Shell, <T3>i.e.</T3>, whether it was forced to absorb the alleged overcharges.Based on our experience in numerous Subpart V proceedings, we will adoptcertain presumptions concerning injury in this case. The use of presumptionsin refund cases is specifically authorized by DOE procedural regulations.10 CFR 205.282(e). An applicant that is not covered by one of these presumptionsmust demonstrate injury in accordance with the non-presumption proceduresoutlined in the latter part of this Decision.1. <T3>Presumptions Concerning Injury.</T3> The presumptions we will adoptin this case are designed to allow claimants to participate in the refundprocess without incurring inordinate expense, and to enable OHA to considerthe refund applications in the most efficient way possible. We will presumethat end-users of Shell covered products, certain types of regulated firms,and cooperatives were injured by their purchases from Shell. In addition,we will adopt presumptions regarding small and mid-level claims submittedby refiners, resellers and retailers. Finally, we will presume that refiners,resellers and retailers that made spot purchases of Shell products, aswell as those who sold Shell products on consignment, were not injuredby their purchases. Each of these presumptions is discussed below, alongwith the rationale underlying its use.a. <T3>End-Users.</T3> First, in accordance with prior Subpart V proceedings,we will presume that end-users of Shell products were injured by the firm'salleged overcharges. Unlike regulated firms in the petroleum industry,members of this group generally were not subject to price controls duringthe consent order period, and were not required to keep records which justifiedselling price increases by reference to cost increases. Consequently, analysisof the impact of the alleged overcharges on the final prices of goods andservices produced by members of this group would be beyond the scope ofa special refund proceeding. <T3>See Marion Corporation,</T3> 12 DOE andpara; 85,014 (1984) and casescited therein. Therefore, end-users need only document their purchase volumesof Shell covered products to demonstrate that they were injured by thealleged overcharges.b. <T3>Regulated Firms and Cooperatives.</T3> Second, public utilities, agriculturalcooperatives, and other firms whose prices are regulated by governmentagencies or cooperative agreements do not have to submit detailed proofof injury. Such firms would have routinely passed through price increases,including overcharges, to their customers. Likewise, their customers wouldshare the benefits of cost decreases resulting from refunds. <T3>See, e.g., Office of Special Counsel,</T3> 9 DOE andpara; 82,538 (1982)(<T3>Tenneco</T3>); <T3>Office of Special Counsel,</T3> 9 DOE andpara; 82,545 at 85,244 (1982)(<T3>Pennzoil</T3>). Such firms applying for refunds should certify thatthey will pass through any refund received to their customers and shouldexplain how they will alert the appropriate regulatory body or membershipgroup to monies received. Purchases that cooperatives subsequently resoldto nonmembers will generally not be covered by this presumption.c. <T3>Refiner, Reseller and Retailer Small Claims. </T3>Third, we will presumethat a firm that resold Shell products and whose volumetric share of theconsent order fund is $5,000 or less, excluding accrued interest, was injuredby Shell's alleged overcharges. A refiner, reseller, or retailer seekinga refund under this small claims presumption will not be required to submitevidence of injury beyond documentation of its purchase volumes of coveredproducts from Shell during the consent order period. <T3>See Texas Oil andamp; Gas Corp.</T3>, 12 DOE andpara; 85,069 at 88,210(1984). As we have noted in numerous prior proceedings, there may be considerableexpense involved in gathering the types of data necessary to support adetailed claim of injury; in some cases, that expense might possibly exceedthe expected refund. Consequently, failure to allow simplified applicationprocedures for small claims could deprive injured parties of their opportunityto obtain a refund. Furthermore, use of the small claims presumption isdesirable in that it allows OHA to process efficiently the large numberof routine refund claims expected. Refiners, resellers and retailers ofShell products that are seeking full volumetric refunds in excess of $5,000must follow the injury demonstration procedures that are outlined belowin Section 2.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ If an applicant with a claim greater than $5,000 attemptsto make a detailed showing of injury in support of a full volumetric refundbut, instead, demonstrates that it was injured by less than $5,000, itwill receive a refund equal to the amount of demonstrated injury and nota refund at the $5,000 small claims threshold level. <T3>See, e.g.</T3>, Union Texas Petroleum Corp./Arrow Enterprises, Inc.,15 DOE andpara; DOE 85,087 (1986).d. <T3>Refiner, Reseller and Retailer Mid-Level Claims.</T3> Fourth, we willadopt a mid-level presumption of injury under which a refiner, reseller,or retailer whose volumetric share exceeds $5,000 may elect to receiveas its refund the larger of $5,000 or 40% of its allocable share up to$50,000 in lieu of making a detailed showing of injury.\7\<NOTE/> The use of this presumption is based on detailed marketinganalyses that we conducted in prior special refund proceedings, which indicatedthat mid-level claimants likely absorbed 40 percent of any overchargesthat they allegedly incurred. <T3>See Gulf Oil Corp., </T3>16 DOE andpara;85,381 (1987) (<T3>Gulf II</T3>).\8\<NOTE/> As with the small claims presumption, an applicant that choosesto rely on the mid-level presumption will be required only to documentits purchase volumes of Shell covered products in order to demonstratethat it was injured by Shell's alleged overcharges.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ A claimant with purchases of 55,304,203 gallons or lessthat wishes to rely on an injury presumption can receive a larger refundby limiting its claim to the $5,000 small claims threshold than by utilizingthe mid-level presumption. If 40 percent of a claimant's volumetric shareexceeds $50,000, <T3>i.e.,</T3> if the claimant purchased more than 553,102,877 gallonsof Shell covered products, the claimant may choose to limit its claim to$50,000.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The PMAA and Energy Refunds have suggested that we adopthigher presumptive levels of injury for middle distillates and naturalgas liquids as we did in Getty Oil Co., 15 DOE andpara;85,064 (1986) (Getty).The different absorption fractions that we adopted in Getty, however, werebased strictly on Getty's pricing data. Getty at 88,117. They are not relevantto the present proceeding. Furthermore, the use of a single average absorptionfraction simplifies the refund procedures for the benefits of both theclaimants and the DOE. Therefore, we will not adopt the higher presumptionlevels suggested for these products. <T3>See</T3> Gulf II at 88,737.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ A mid-level claimant may elect not to receive a refundbased upon this presumption and may instead attempt to show that it iseligible for a refund equal to its full volumetric share by making a detailedshowing of injury using the criteria set forth later in this Decision.The 40 percent presumption, however, will not be available to claimantswho submit a detailed injury showing which leads us to conclude that theyare eligible for a refund of less than 40 percent of their volumetric share.e. <T3>Spot Purchasers.</T3> We will also presume that refiners, resellers,and retailers that were spot purchasers of a Shell covered product, <T3>i.e., </T3>made only sporadic, discretionary purchases, were not injuredby their purchases. Consequently, they generally will be ineligible forrefunds. The basis for this presumption is that a spot purchaser tendedto have considerable discretion as to where and when to make a purchase,and therefore would not have made a purchase unless it was able to recoverthe full amount of its purchase price, including any alleged overcharges,from its customers. <T3>See Vickers</T3> at 85,396-97.Citing <T3>Tresler Oil Company</T3>/<T3>Swifty Oil Company,</T3> 16 DOE andpara;85,659 (1987) (<T3>Swifty</T3>), Energy Refunds suggests that we allow spot purchasersto receive 20% of their full volumetric shares without demonstrating injury.There is nothing in <T3>Swifty,</T3> however, to support such a suggestion,\10\<NOTE/> and Energy Refunds has not provided any other reasoning thatwould support its position. Consequently, we will adopt the presumptionof non-injury for spot purchasers outlined in the PDandamp;O. In past proceedings,however, a spot purchaser has been able to rebut this presumption by demonstratingthat its base period supply obligation limited its discretion in makingthe purchases and that it resold the product at a loss that was not subsequentlyrecouped. <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> <T3>Saber, Energy, Inc.</T3>/<T3>Mobil Oil Corp.,</T3> 14 DOE andpara; 85,170 (1986).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ In Swifty, the applicant was granted a refund on itspurchases that were made under a long-term contract with the consent orderfirm, but was denied a refund on its spot purchases.f. <T3>Consignees.</T3> Finally, we will presume that consignees of Shellcovered products were not injured by the firm's alleged pricing violations.<T3>See, e.g., Jay Oil Co.,</T3> 16 DOE andpara; 85,147 (1987). A consigneeagent generally sold products pursuant to an agreement whereby its supplierestablished the prices to be charged by the consignee and compensated theconsignee with a fixed commission based upon the volume of products thatit sold. A consignee may rebut the presumption of non-injury by demonstratingthat its sales volumes and corresponding commission revenues declined dueto the alleged uncompetitiveness of Shell's pricing practices. <T3>See Gulf Oil Corp.</T3>/<T3>C.F. Canter Oil Co., </T3>13 DOE andpara;85,388 at 88,962 (1986).2. <T3>Non-Presumption Demonstration of Injury. </T3>A refiner, reseller orretailer whose allocable share is in excess of $5,000 that does not electto receive a refund under either the small claims or 40 percent mid-levelpresumptions will be required to demonstrate its injury. There are twoaspects to such a demonstration. First, a firm generally is required toprovide a monthly schedule of its banks of unrecouped increased productcosts for each covered product that it purchased from Shell during theconsent order period.\1\\1\<NOTE/> Cost banks for a product should cover the period November1, 1973 through the product's price decontrol date.\1\\2\<NOTE/> If a firm no longer has records of contemporaneously calculatedcost banks for a particular product, it may approximate those banks bysubmitting the following information regarding its purchases of that productfrom all of its suppliers:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ Claimants who have relied upon their banked costs inorder to be eligible to receive refunds in other special refund proceedingsshould subtract those refunds from the cumulative banked costs submittedin this proceeding. <T3>See </T3>Husky Oil Co./Metro Oil Products, Inc., 16 DOE andpara; 85,090at 88, 179 (1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ Retailers and resellers of motor gasoline were requiredto maintain cost bank data only until July 15, 1979 and April 30, 1980,respectively. Therefore, in showing injury with respect to their purchasesof motor gasoline, such claimants will not be required to submit cost bankmaterial all the way up to the January 28, 1981 decontrol date of motorgasoline. (1) The weighted average gross profit margin that the firm received forthe product on May 15, 1973;(2) a monthly schedule of the weighted average gross profit margins thatit received for the product during the period, November 1, 1973 throughthe product's price decontrol date; and(3) a monthly schedule of the firm's purchase or sales volumes of the productduring the period November 1, 1973 through the product's price decontroldate.\1\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ For motor gasoline, retailers and resellers have tosubmit the information detailed in Parts (2) and (3) only through July15, 1979 and April 30, 1980, respectively. <T3>See supra </T3>note 12.The existence of banks of unrecouped increased product costs that exceedan applicant's potential refund is only the first part of an injury demonstration.A firm must also show that market conditions forced it to absorb the allegedovercharges. We will infer this to be true if the prices the applicantpaid Shell were higher than average market prices for the product concernedat the same level of distribution.\1\\4\<NOTE/> Accordingly, a claimant attempting to demonstrate injuryshould submit a monthly schedule of the weighted average prices that itpaid Shell for each covered product that it purchased between March 6,1973 and the product's decontrol date.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ We generally obtain average market price informationfrom Platt's Oil Price handbook and Oilmanac (Platt's). If price data fora particular product is not available in Platt's, the burden of supplyingalternative information will be on the claimant.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. General Refund Application Requirements</ITAG>Pursuant to 10 CFR 205.283, we will now accept Applications for Refundfrom individuals and firms that purchased refined petroleum products soldby Shell between March 6, 1973 and the date of decontrol for the products.No ``class claims'' on behalf of groups of applicants will be permitted.There is no specific application form that must be used. However, a suggestedformat for filing a Shell Refund Application is set forth in the Appendixto this Decision. All applicatons for Refund should include the followinginformation:(1) A conspicuous reference to Case Number RF315 and the name and addressof the applicant during the period for which the claim is filed, as wellas the name to whom the refund check should be made out and the addressto which the check should be sent;(2) The name, title, address and telephone number of a person who may becontacted by OHA for additional information concerning the Application;(3) The manner in which the applicant used the Shell products, <T3>i.e., </T3>whether it was a reseller, retailer, consignee, end-user,etc.;(4) For each covered product, a monthly schedule of purchases from Shellduring the period March 6, 1973 through the product's decontrol date. <T3>See supra </T3>note 4. If an applicant received a computer printoutof its Shell purchases from OHA, it may submit that printout in lieu ofmonthly purchase volume schedules. If the applicant was an indirect purchaserit must also submit the name of its immediate supplier and indicate whyit believes the covered product was originally sold by Shell;(5) All relevant material necessary to support its claim in accordancewith the injury presumptions and requirements outlined above;(6) If the applicant was or is in any way affiliated with Shell, an explanationof the nature of the affiliation;(7) A statement as to whether there has been a change in ownership of theentity that purchased the Shell refined petroleum products during or sincethe consent order period. If there was such a change, the applicant mustsubmit a copy of the sales agreement, as well as provide the names andaddresses of the previous or subsequent owners;(8) A statement as to whether the applicant is or has been involved inany DOE enforcement proceedings or private actions filed under Section210 of the Economic Stabilization Act. If these actions have been concluded,the applicant should furnish a copy of any final order issued in the matter.If the action is still in progress, the applicant should briefly describethe action and its current status. The applicant must inform OHA of anychange in status while its Application for Refund is pending. <T3>See</T3> 10 CFR 205.9(d);(9) A statement as to whether the applicant has received a refund, fromany source, for the alleged overcharges identified in the ERA audits underlyingthis proceeding;(10) A statement as to whether the applicant or a related firm has filedany other Applicants for Refund in this proceeding;(11) A statement as to whether the claimant or a related firm has authorizedany other individual(s) to file an Application for Refund on the claimant'sbehalf in the Shell proceeding; and(12) The following statement signed by the applicant or a responsible officialof the business or organization claiming the refund: ``I swear [or affirm]that the information submitted is true and accurate to the best of my knowledgeand belief.'' <T3>See</T3> 10 CFR 205.283(c).Applications for Refund should be sent to: Shell Refund Proceeding, CaseNo. RF315, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department of Energy, 1000 IndependenceAvenue SW., Washington, DC 20585.All applications must be filed in duplicate and must be postmarked by November30, 1989. A copy of each application will be available for public inspectionin the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals. Anyapplicant that believes that its application contains confidential informationmust submit two additional copies of its application from which the confidentialinformation has been deleted, together with a statement specifying whythe information is confidential.It Is Therefore Ordered That:(1) Applications for Refund from the funds remitted to the Department ofEnergy by Shell Oil Company pursuant to the Consent Order finalized onMarch 26, 1987 may now be filed.(2) All applications must be postmarked by November 30, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: January 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">George B.
