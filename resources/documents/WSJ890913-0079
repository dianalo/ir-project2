But the dream is turning sour.    High interest rates and high stock prices are making the British LBO market prohibitively expensive for potential investors, and are causing a backlog of stalled LBOs to pile up on the shelves of many investment banking firms.    &quot;I don't want to appear a cynic, but what this country needs is a good five-cent recession,&quot; quips Anthony J. Freeman, head of mergers and acquisitions at Merrill Lynch International Ltd. &quot;Like everyone else, we're finding it quite difficult&quot; to arrange LBOs, he adds.    Moreover, the high interest rates -- the base lending rate currently is 14% -- have cooled Britain's credit-driven consumer buying boom, and thus made trouble for a number of completed or proposed LBOs by retailing companies, including Magnet PLC, Ward White PLC and MFI Group.    Few in the London financial community predict that LBOs will vanish from the British scene. But many bankers and investors predict that, because of certain peculiarities of the British financial system, LBOs may never make the impact here that they did on the U.S. corporate and financial scene in the 1980s.    An LBO generally involves the purchase of a company by a group including the current or a new management team using a large amount of debt supplied by financial institutions. The debt is to be repaid, usually within five to seven years, through the company's cash flow -- if necessary, by the sale of assets. Because of the highly leveraged nature of the transaction, lenders command a high interest rate.    &quot;The note of caution that has crept -- perhaps galloped -- into the market is a temporary phenomenon,&quot; asserts Jeffrey Rosen, a managing director of Wasserstein, Perella andamp; Co. &quot;But I don't see any rampant waves of LBOs engulfing the British market.&quot;    For one thing, Mr. Rosen notes, many British lending institutions are nervous about providing high-yield junk debt. And investing institutions here &quot;haven't become instant arbitragers like in the U.S. They take a more thoughtful attitude toward a sale, and price isn't always the prime consideration,&quot; he adds.    Alistair MacLennan, senior fund manager at Norwich Union Insurance Group, says flatly: &quot;We would be cautious&quot; about LBOs.    The current 14% base lending rate translates into at least a 15% to 17% junk rate, reckons Merrill Lynch's Mr. Freeman. By saddling a company with those interest rates, &quot;It makes it very, very difficult to get the numbers to work on most LBOs in Britain,&quot; he says.    Observes Ronald M. Freeman, Salomon Brothers Inc.'s head of European investment banking:    &quot;The LBO opportunity in the U.S. was created not so much by Mike Milken,&quot; Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s former junk-bond wizard, &quot;it was created by {former Federal Reserve Board Chairman} Paul Volcker, who took the cost of funds down from 20% to 5% in a straight line.&quot;    Other factors are pressing the LBO market. Michael Stoddart, chairman of Electra Investment Trust PLC, says his company is wary of investing in British LBOs because &quot;the outlook for business is worse than it has been for some time.&quot; Yet, he adds, high stock prices &quot;have raised the expectations&quot; of corporate managers that they still can get a high premium for their shares in a buy-out.    Michael Howell, Salomon's head of European investment strategy, asserts that corporate cash flows generally are lower in Britain than in the U.S. because British workers are one-third less productive. &quot;There's a case for cherry-picking&quot; certain LBO targets in the United Kingdom, &quot;but there isn't a case for generalized LBO activity,&quot; he says.    Much of the LBO euphoria was generated last July when Sir James Goldsmith bid #13.4 billion ($20.72 billion) for B.A.T Industries PLC, in what would be the second largest buy-out in history. But the bid has become ensnared by the regulatory tangles it has encountered in the U.S.    That has left bankers to ponder the fates of some large retailer LBOs. Because of lack of demand, Magnet underwriters, led by Bankers Trust Co., last month shelved plans to resell the #281.2 million debt they incurred in the company's LBO.    Gordon Bonnyman, a Bankers Trust managing director, recalls that a potential institutional buyer of the Magnet debt balked &quot;because he said he had just paid twice&quot; for another buy-out, MFI, &quot;and he indicated he didn't want to go through the same thing again.&quot;    MFI earlier had to return to its investors to refinance some debt remaining from its 1987 buy-out. Ward White failed to raise enough money for its own buy-out and instead was taken over last month by Boots Co.    One banker who isn't complaining is Daniel Brill, head of Citibank's European leveraged capital division. &quot;My people are working round-the-clock on three U.K. buy-outs, each in the billion-dollar league,&quot; he says. &quot;Maybe I'm the exception that proves the rule.&quot; @ --- @ Major British LBOs @ (In billions of pounds) @ Gateway (1989) #2.150 @ MFI (1987) 0.718 @ Reedpack (1988) 0.631 @ Magnet (1989) 0.629 @ Lowndes Queensway (1988) 0.450 @ Source: Salomon Brothers Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
