says Harry Reinstein,chairman of the board and CEO of Aion Corp., Palo Alto, Calif.andP;  &quot;When you useinference-based data processing, you determine what you have to declare.andP;  Youstate facts.andP;  The inference engine looks at it and decides what needs to bedone.&quot;andM;The term &quot;inference-based data processing&quot; was apparently coined by thefounders of Aion, builders of the expert system Application DevelopmentSystem (ADS), now used by other vendors and industry analysts.andM;&quot;It's a very fast way to develop applications,&quot; says James Martin,world-renowned high-technology author, speaker and consultant.andM;&quot;With artificial intelligence tools and expert system shells, you can developcertain types of complex applications very quickly.andP;  This approach permitsyou to build applications that otherwise might not get built at all,&quot; Martinsays.andM;For some, the term inference-based data processing represents the integrationof just certain types of AI technology, like expert system shells, intomainstream DP application development.andP;  However, Martin points out that AIprogramming languages like Lisp and Prolog can also be used to developcertain types of applications quickly.andM;Inferencing techniques are increasingly viewed as an important newprogramming technique that permits the translation of policies and proceduresinto rules which are then incorporated into traditional systems.andM;Inference-based data processing might not work for all applications.andO;However, when used for the right systems, many developers using variousexpert system shells are seeing significant increases in the speed ofdeveloping applications.andM;IBM spokesman Glenn Rossman says customers are experiencing dramaticincreases in software development productivity by using their expert systemtools to develop applications.andM;President Larry Harris of AICorp, Waltham, Mass., can point to similarproductivity increases with his firm's KBMS product.andP;  So can Kendra Bonnettof Information Builders, New York City, and executives of Cullinet SoftwareInc., Westwood, Mass., Micro Data Base Systems, Lafayette, Ind., and otherexpert system shell representatives.andM;ESSENTIALS OF EXPERT SYSTEMSandM;An expert system contains expertise, or knowledge, about a particular area orsubject.andP;  This expertise is often represented in the form of if-then rules,though it may take the form of frames or objects or other forms of knowledgerepresentation.andM;Expert system shells are software tools that include a ready-built inferenceengine, interface software, easy-to-use commands and a framework for theknowledge base.andP;  All the developer has to do is to fill in the rules of theknowledge base, state the goals of the system and make the right connectionswith the interface software.andP;  The rules are entered as declarations into theexpert system shell.andM;The interface software might provide a variety of techniques to interact withan end user, but increasingly it also includes sophisticated routines tointegrate with existing databases and traditional programming systems.andM;The inference engine and knowledge base are the heart of the expert systemshell.andP;  The rules are contained in the knowledge base.andP;  The inferenceengine--the reasoning component supplied with the software--examines theknowledge base and determines what to do to achieve the goal it has beeninstructed to perform.andM;Many end users are developing their own expert systems without the help ofMIS, by using the inexpensive and available off-the-shelf expert systemshells.andP;  In fact, a user will often be more able to cope with a very simpleshell like VP-Expert than a brilliant, experienced programmer who likes tofind bit manipulation capabilities in software tools.andP;  VP-Expert is fromPaperback Software International, Berkeley, Calif.andM;Seasoned programmers often have to rethink their strategy when using anexpert system shell.andP;  Procedural logic can be incorporated within the expertapplication in many different ways.andP;  The more capable the shell is--as in&quot;more expensive&quot; also--the easier it will be to intertwine the proceduralaspects into the expert application.andM;Many shells provide a modular, structured approach.andP;  For example, in AICorp'sKnowledge Base Management Systems (KBMS), the developer creates packets.andO;Each packet has a goal.andP;  The expert system's job is to achieve the goalestablished by that packet by examining the associated rule base.andM;The packets are like subroutines.andP;  Each packet has an entry sequence and anexit sequence.andP;  In the entry sequence, the developer can say what needs to bedone before the inference engine examines the rule base.andP;  Similarly, in theexit sequence, the developer can instruct the system to do some finalprocessing after the goal knowledge has been acquired.andM;In a different technique, expert system shells will permit you to simulate,in effect, procedural logic within the rule base.andP;  Experienced programmersare often amazed at how much of what is normally written as procedural codecan also be stated as rules.andP;  A wide variety of applications can be developedusing an inferencing approach.andM;A common payroll system provides a good example.andP;  &quot;You wouldn't normallythink of payroll as an expert system,&quot; says Larry Cohn, president and COO ofAion.andP;  &quot;But you could develop a payroll application using inference-baseddata processing.&quot;andM;Examples of rules that could be inserted into a payroll knowledge base are asfollows: Net pay = Gross pay - Deductions Gross pay = Base pay + Overtime IfEmployee status is &quot;Exempt,&quot; then Overtime = 0.andM;&quot;When you put rules like that in a knowledge base,&quot; explains Cohn, &quot;you havea set of declaratives which are interrelated.andP;  This is the knowledgerepresentation.andP;  And based on what you're trying to calculate, the inferenceengine will set about to provide the necessary sequence to determine all theinformation it needs to produce the paycheck.&quot;andM;The order of the rules to be entered is not important.andP;  The inference enginewill examine all of the rules in accomplishing its objective--in this case,to produce a paycheck.andP;  This is a key difference between inference-based dataprocessing and traditional, procedural code.andM;THE INFERENCE DIFFERENCEandM;Are inference-based data processing and expert systems the same thing?andM;Not quite.andP;  While expert system shells are used to develop both, there is adifference.andM;To some extent, it is a &quot;point of view&quot; difference.andP;  But, it is more thanthat.andP;  Inference-based DP is a new approach to application development.andM;&quot;We are talking about new types of programming techniques,&quot; says James Martinin &quot;Technology Management,&quot; a recent video series he produced with AppliedLearning of Naperville, Ill., the new company formed by the merger of Deltakand Advanced systems.andM;&quot;Instead of conventional procedural programming as in Cobol or Fortran,&quot;Martin continues, &quot;we now have AI programming techniques.andP;  Here, we expressrules and knowledge, and then use an inference engine for sifting through therules to come to conclusions.&quot;andM;The traditional approach to application development is to develop proceduralcode.andP;  For example, in procedural code we perform a series of procedures orsteps.andM;First, we get a record (step one) and select a field (step two).andP;  If thefield is greater than some value (step three), we go to the XYZ Routine (stepfour), where we proceed to perform steps five through nine zillion.andM;One does not do that in inference-based data processing.andP;  The whole approachis quite different.andP;  With inference-based data processing, you state rules ormake declarations.andM;Generally, the order in which you specify these declarative statements is notimportant.andP;  The inference engine takes care of that.andM;The developer is relieved of most of the concern about the logic or theprocedural sequence of code--an extremely important difference.andP;  Ittremendously speeds up the development cycle.andM;Because less time is spent planning the logical sequence of code, overallapplication development time is significantly reduced.andP;  Correspondingly,system maintenance is also dramatically simplified.andM;A maintenance programmer does not have to worry about erroneously alteringprogram logic.andP;  With inference-based data processing, when policies andregulations change, corresponding changes are made to the rules in theknowledge base.andP;  The inference engine stays the same.andP;  No program logicchanges are required.andM;&quot;Applications with a much larger degree of change and complexity can now behandled,&quot; says Aion's Cohn.andP;  &quot;I think this is the need that drives this newapplication development approach.andP;  Not only can you handle large amounts ofchange and complexity, but you can do it in an economic fashion.andP;  It's adramatic achievement.&quot;andM;Inference-based development also lends itself to prototyping.andP;  Developers canput together a basic system quite quickly and show the system to end users.andM;With the inference engine already built, the developer only has to insertenough rules to achieve a meaningful result before a prototype is ready todemonstrate.andM;Reinstein of Aion says that in the early 1980s, while working together atIBM, he and Cohn saw the potential of expert system shells to speed up thedata processing application development process.andM;&quot;We could see that if you built applications by description rather than byprocedural code, you should be able to build them faster,&quot; says Reinstein.andO;&quot;And indeed, people have been doing that.andP;  There has been anywhere from a5-to-20 time improvement that we see fairly routinely in terms of time andpeople cost.andP;  We had expected that improvement and we saw it.&quot;andM;An added benefit is that the end user involvement is greater, therebyenhancing the quality of the final system.andM;&quot;That part surprised us,&quot; adds Reinstein.andP;  &quot;Since you were describing theapplication in what is relatively application-oriented terms, you got a muchmore intimate and earlier involvement of the problem analyst and end user.andO;Thereofre, the quality of the application went up because it much moreclosely matched what their requirements were.&quot;andM;While expert systems were important for embodying an expert's knowledge, thenew expert system shells offered a new application development life cycle.andM;&quot;We no longer had the typical and classic development situation, where theend user and analyst created the requirements, gave them to the DP staff, andthe DP staff converted them into programs which eventually went back to theend user.andP;  There was a significant length of time in that process,&quot; Reinsteinsaid.andM;Cohn adds, &quot;By then, a couple of years had gone by, and the users weren'tsure why they had asked for that original stuff--and they certainly had abrand-new set of requirements by then.andP;  So, you failed.andM;&quot;As an application manager, you had just spent two years of the company'stime sincerely trying to produce a meaningful system, but it took too longand things changed, and so you failed,&quot; he said.andM;The process is much quicker with inference-based DP.andM;While some proponents say that any application could be built usinginference-based data processing, most suggest a blending of technologies.andM;Cobol is good for complex programs, but difficult to change and maintain.andO;And fourth-generation languages are effective for rapid prototyping, but arenot appropriate for extremely complex programs.andP;  &quot;Inference processing offersan alternative which handles both complexity and change,&quot; Cohn said.andM;BOOLE AN EARLY USERandM;Aion started out marketing its tool to software vendors, one of which wasBoole andamp; Babbage, where Reinstein had the advantage of knowing an insiderpersonally.andP;  &quot;I become interested in inference-based data processing a fewyears ago when Aion first started,&quot; says Jack Van Kinsbergen, chief technicalofficer at Boole andamp; Babbage, Sunnyvale, Calif.andP;  &quot;I realized we were putting alot of numbers out regarding optimizing data center management.andP;  I felt therehad to be a smarter way of analyzing all those figures.andM;&quot;Also, I knew Harry Reinstein and Larry Cohn from our days together at IBMback in the early and mid-60s.andP;  We wrote a lot of the original operatingsystem code for the 360,&quot; adds Van Kinsbergen.andP;  &quot;So, I knew they weredown-to-earth, pragmatic systems technicians, not the unrealistic academictypes who dominated the expert system field a few years ago.andM;&quot;With the combination of knowing the quality of their work, the fact thatthey were systems people and the fact that they were building a commerciallyviable system, I felt confident that they would be able to pull it off.andP;  So.andO;I signed up early.&quot;andM;Van Kinsbergen was &quot;the brains&quot; behind Boole's DASD Advisor, which interpretsmessages from Boole's DASD management software for operators.andM;The DASD Advisor produced $2 million in revenue for Boole in nine months ofsales, at a list price of $24,750.andM;Van Kinsbergen has been working with Aion technology for several years now,incorporating expert systems technology into Boole andamp; Babbage software.andP;  Whatdoes he think of Aion's ADS as an application development tool?andM;&quot;I think it's just plain fabulous,&quot; he responds.andP;  &quot;There are a number ofreasons for that.andP;  First, inference-based data processing relieves thedevelopment person of a lot of things.andP;  It relieves the programmer of howthings chain together.andM;&quot;The decision tree we have to go through in procedural code is verycomplicated.andP;  When it comes to really complex, combinatorial logic, we justdon't do it.andP;  It gets too complicated in procedural code.andP;  However, nowthere's a way to do it.&quot;andM;Van Kinsbergen is also pleased with another strong feature of Aion'sproducts.andP;  He can do all of the development on his PC and then move theentire system, as is, over to the mainframe.andP;  There is 100% compatibilitybetween the two environments.andP;  Van Kinsbergen says he even does all of histesting on the PC.andM;&quot;The producitivity of this environment on a PC is at least 10-to-20 times--inmy opinion--the productivity you get under TSO on a mainframe,&quot; says VanKinsbergen.andP;  &quot;On the PC, I don't have any of the garbage you have to put upwith on the mainframe--whether the data set is running out of space, orthere's a linkage editor control card error, or there's so many users thatyou're getting bad response time, or the machine goes down.andP;  I don't have anyof that.&quot;andM;WHEN TO USE INFERENCEandM;On the subject of when to use inference processing techniques, Larry Harrisof AICorp offers some insights.andP;  AICorp's KBMS is an inference-basedapplication development system designed specifically for IBM systems,integrating well with mainframe hardware and software.andM;Harris said, &quot;I like to sun it up in one word--'judgment.'andP;  If the nature ofthe application is that you want to embody human judgment, then it's in theexpert system's inference-based arena.&quot;andP;  He feels that insurance underwritingis a classic expert system application.andP;  But there are a limited number ofqualified underwriters with the right kind of experience and expertise tosupply the expert system rules.andM;&quot;Sure, there are corporate guidelines--in binders that are three-inchesthick--but it still takes judgment to apply those guidelines to anyparticular case,&quot; he said.andM;Harris suggests that judgemental problems are at the opposite end of thespectrum from procedural, algorithmic problems.andP;  The difficulty, of course,comes in deciding which approach is more appropriate for the middle of thespectrum.andM;A pricing application in an order processing system must reflect whatevermarketing promotion is in effect: two for one sales, discounts for quantitypurchases, or discounts for geographic regions.andP;  Judgment is involved insetting a price.andM;&quot;People have written such applications in Cobol and have had great difficultyin maintaining them over the years.andP;  Pricing is the high maintenance area inmost of these order entry systems for exactly this reason,&quot; Harris said.andO;Sometimes a marketing promotion is not undertaken because data processing isunable to update price modules in time, he noted.andM;With inference-based processing, rules describe current marketing promotions,not procedural code.andP;  Changes in promotions would only be made to theknowledge base.andP;  These changes to the knowledge base could be made with aneditor--much like using word processing software to change a few lines in adocument.andM;KBMS works with AICorp.'s Intellect natural language tool, which produces SQLdatabase queries from English-like statements.andP;  KBMS is implemented in the Clanguage, which allows all C functions to be available to KBMS programmers.andM;In a procedural aspect of KBMS, sequences of actions are contained in&quot;packets,&quot; which are essentially subroutines that lead to a goal.andP;  Rules fitinside the packet.andM;Another product from AICorp, Intellect, a natural language interface,provides a front end.andP;  Also, KBMS is implemented in the C programminglanguage.andP;  All of the built-in C functions are passed directly to the KBMSprogrammer.andM;Many of the expert system development tools permit procedural and structuredconcepts to be incorporated into the application.andP;  Many shells have a conceptsimilar to AICorp's packet and many permit the chaining of knowledge bases.andM;One of the largest implementations of chained knowledge bases was built byGary Ribar of Peat Marwick Main Co., Montvale, N.J., in the Level 5 productfrom Information Builders, Inc., New York.andP;  Peat Marwick's Loan Probe, acommercial loan advisor, contains over 8,000 rules divided among 33 chainedknowledge bases which share facts.andP;  Separate knowledge bases permit anapplication to be structured into discrete, logical components.andM;BUILT-IN PROCEDURAL RULESandM;In addition to chaining knowledge bases, Level 5 permits parameter passing toprocedural modules, and also provides procedural rules within the expertsystem shell itself.andP;  While the majority of Level 5 consists of theProduction Rule Language, a number of procedural rules are built into it.andM;Dave Leininger, director of International Distribution for Micro Data BaseSystems (Mdbs) believes the procedural aspects of expert system applicationdevelopment are extremely important.andM;&quot;You can't build an intelligent application without the procedural codeaspect,&quot; says Leininger.andP;  &quot;If you can blend an inference engine and afourth-generation language together, that is far more useful than aninference engine alone.andM;&quot;But you still run into problems with that approach,&quot; explains Leinger.andO;&quot;Either you don't have enough memory or you have to use extended memory.andM;&quot;The situation gets even more complicated if you want to pass the data to bea spreadsheet or create graphs from the data.andP;  What if you want tocommunicate data from the mainframe?andP;  You'll have to interface withcommunication software.andP;  When you start to combine several software productsfrom different vendors, it can become quite a problem,&quot; says Leininger.andM;The approach of Mdbs' PC-based tool, Guru, is to integrate with the multiplefunctions available from the company's KnowledgeMan/2 product.andP;  It combines abuilt-in database management system, spreadsheet analyzer, screen painter,business graphics, text processing, report generator and externalcommunications capabilities.andM;The importance of encompassing procedural logic with an expert systemapplication is also emphasized by Cullinet Software, which offers theEnterprise:Expert tool for expert application development.andM;&quot;With our expert system, the procedural language component could be any ofthe following:Cobol, Fortran, C, PL/1, Basic or Assembler.andP;  Any of theselanguages would just call the expert system when needed,&quot; said BillMcLaughlin, marketing manager for the product.andM;Cullinet's strategy is to integrate with traditional MIS environments, andapply inference-based processing to inputting data, transaction processingand outputting information.andP;  The tool can be used to embed expert modulesinto existing applications.andM;IBM'S THREE ENTRIESandM;To serve a wide variety of application needs, IBM offers three separateinference-based systems offering a broad range of both rule-based andprocedural capabilities.andM;IBM's most widely used product is the Expert System Environment (ESE), whichis designed for users with few computer skills.andP;  KnowledgeTool, designed fordata processing professionals, adds expert functions to existingapplications.andM;The third package, IBM KEE, provides a System/370 MVS mainframe version ofthe Knowledge Engineering Environment (KEE) from IntelliCorp, Mountain  View,Calif.andM;The Expert System Environment operates on the mainframe; its companion ExpertSystem Consultation Environment can be embedded within an IMS, CICS, TSO orbatch application.andP;  MVS system support allows ESE to take full advantage ofMVS/XA by exploiting the MVS/XA 31-bit addressing scheme.andP;  It also has theability to merge small knowledge bases into a single large knowledge base andfor knowledge bases to dynamically call one another.andM;A related product, the Expert System Consultation Environment/PC provides theability to run a consultation session under DOS on a a PS/2, PC XT or AT froma knowledge base created on a host processor under MVS or VM.andP;  This productoffers direct external interface to programs written in Assembler, Pascal andC.andP;  User-written programs in any of these three languages can be used toaccess databases, spreadsheets and data files.andM;INTERESTING MIXandM;IBM's KnowledgeTool provides an interesting mix of procedural aspects andinferencing by enabling users to encode declarative statements within theframework of a procedural language.andM;KnowledgeTool source statements can be a mixture of PL/1 statements and ruleconstructs, which can examine and modify data in working memory.andP;  The &quot;facts&quot;or knowledge in working memory may have been obtained using PL/1 databaseaccess statements.andM;A translator converts the KnowledgeTool source statements into PL/1expressions (PL/1 source code) and rule files.andP;  The PL/1 source code iscompiled into object code by the PL/1 Optimizing Compiler.andP;  The processresults in a library of object modules and rule files.andP;  The object codeproduced by the PL/1 compiler constitutes the procedural components of therules.andP;  The library is used at run time, constituting the compiled form ofthe knowledge base.andM;IBM customers are experiencing the same productivity increases withapplication of development as others.andP;  An IBM spokesman says that AmericanExpress brought up a claim review application using the Expert SystemEnvironment in six months.andP;  They believe it would have taken them three yearsin a standard programming language such as Cobol.andM;James Martin says, &quot;There is no doubt that the corporation of the year 2000is going to have enormous amounts of artificial intelligence everywhere.andM;&quot;And you better believe one thing,&quot; he adds, &quot;the corporations that do itfirst will put some of te other corporations out of business.andP;  AI techniquesoffer a strategic business opportunity.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
