The problem andpotential solutions are reviewed. Non-destructive examination methodsto detect damage are described. Temperature monitoring techniques tocorrelate cracking with operating parameters is an important step inidentifying the failure mechanism. Approaches to problem solution includecomponent integrity assessments and control of crack growth rates bylimiting through-wall temperature gradients. For headers which requirereplacement, design modifications to reduce stress concentration factorsare described.</TEXT></DOC>
