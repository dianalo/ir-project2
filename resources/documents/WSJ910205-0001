The increase in overall spending would total only 2.6%,sharply less than last year's 12% rise.</LP><TEXT>   The biggest winner in Mr. Bush's budget for fiscal 1992would be scientific research and development of all kinds.Such spending would total $8.4 billion more than in thecurrent year, which ends Sept. 30. Two-thirds of the increasewould be for defense projects.   Other big winners include children, highways and the waron drugs, all of which Budget Director Richard Darman lumpstogether as investments in the future. The biggest losers,once again, would be doctors and hospitals who provide healthcare for the elderly.   Overall defense spending, including Energy Departmentnuclear-weapons programs, would fall 1.2% below the currentyear's levels to $295.2 billion. But that is based on anoptimistic projection of the cost of the Persian Gulf war.   &quot;Reducing the budget deficit by controlling spending mustremain our No. 1 priority,&quot; Treasury Secretary Nicholas Bradysaid yesterday. &quot;This budget does just that.&quot;   Noting that government benefits and other mandatoryspending now consume 52% of the federal budget, up from 28%in 1962, the president proposes in his budget to shave thegrowth of these programs by $6.3 billion in 1992 and by $47billion over the next five years. Still, these programs wouldcost $707.5 billion in 1992, up 3.1% from the current year.   More than half of the savings sought by Mr. Bush wouldcome from proposals the president has pushed unsuccessfullyin the past to squeeze doctors and hospitals. Changes invarious housing programs would save $4.7 billion. Nosignificant changes in agricultural subsidies, which weretackled in last year's farm bill, are proposed.   None of the president's savings proposals are likely to bereceived warmly on Capitol Hill. Under the new budget rules,Mr. Bush could have used the $6.3 billion he proposes to savein benefit programs to expand other benefit programs or cuttaxes. He chose to devote the savings largely to reducing thedeficit.   In what Mr. Darman described as an attempt to ignite adebate on government benefits, the president does makeseveral proposals to distribute government benefits &quot;morefairly.&quot; His budget would triple Medicare premiums paid bythe 600,000 Americans with the highest incomes. It wouldprohibit the 10,000 individuals with nonfarm income above$125,000 from collecting farm subsidies. It would shiftfederal grant money toward the poorest students, forcingmiddle-income students to rely more on government loans. Andit would reduce school-lunch subsidies to children fromfamilies with incomes more than 85% above the poverty lineand use the savings to increase subsidies for poorerchildren.   The prospective savings aren't big: Tripling the Medicarepremium paid by well-off elderly, for instance, would raiseonly $1.2 billion over five years. But the principle isimportant, Mr. Darman said. So are the politics; theproposals give the administration a shield with which todefend itself from Democratic charges that it favors therich.   The budget sticks to the ceilings set last year fordefense spending and for domestic spending. But thoseceilings don't include the cost of the war, governmentbenefits and the costly cleanup of the savings and loanindustry. Within the $212 billion cap on domestic spending,the Bush budget would alter the government's priorities.   &quot;In the domestic discretionary world, you get out of thedebate over how big is the pie and into the debate over howto properly split it up,&quot; said Robert Grady, one of Mr.Darman's deputies.   Targeting what the administration describes ascongressional pork-barrel spending, the president proposessaving $4.6 billion by killing 238 domestic programs --ranging from a $3 million special congressional appropriationfor the Children's National Medical Center in Washington tothe Commerce Department's Economic DevelopmentAdministration. It also proposes reducing spending on 109programs to save an additional $8.3 billion.   But it recommends using all that money, and more, toincrease spending above last year's levels on 250 programs --at a cost of $17.8 billion. Much of that would go toscientific projects from exploring space to seeking a curefor AIDS.   In a budget that breaks little new ground, relativelysmall initiatives draw attention. The president, forinstance, proposes a $171 million program to reduce infantdeath in 10 big cities; about $32 million of that amountwould be drawn from other programs. He seeks a $149 millionincrease in federal support for high-performance computing.And he calls for a $15 million initiative to protect historicbattlefields.   In the following summaries, the figures generally arefederal outlays. They are compared with estimated outlays forfiscal 1991, the current fiscal year. With inflation forecastat about 4%, any increase smaller than that amounts to a cutafter adjusting for inflation.                                                                                                          Environment                                                                                                          Provisions include funds to carry out the Clean Air Act;increased spending on parks, including Civil Warbattlefields; and efforts to improve education for AmericanIndians.   The bulk of the 9% rise to $2.3 billion in theEnvironmental Protection Agency's operating budget would goto clean air. The agency also wants to set up anenvironmental education office to focus on improving scienceliteracy for elementary and secondary schools. Emphasis alsowould be placed on studying the health effects of leadexposure, protecting wetlands and coastal areas, andimproving food safety. The overall EPA budget, which alsoincludes the Superfund program and construction grants, wouldincrease to about $6.1 billion from $5.9 billion.   Spending would expand and preserve parks, wildlife refugesand other public lands and make them more accessible todisabled people. The battlefield program would include grantsto states to improve local protection of sites. The new&quot;Tribal Horizons&quot; program, which would also aim to improvethe management of Indian programs and facilitate tribalself-determination, was scaled back from the department'srequest by the White House budget office. Overall spending onIndian affairs would be essentially unchanged. InteriorDepartment outlays would total $8.7 billion, compared with$8.54 billion in fiscal 1991.   -- Rose Gutfeld                                                                                                          Energy                                                                                                          Efforts to reduce the nation's dependence on oil importsand continued heavy spending on environmental cleanuphighlight the Energy Department budget.   Research spending on conservation and renewable energywould increase a hefty 17% to about $478 million in budgetauthority, after a big rise last year; a big chunk of thefunds would go toward solar-energy research, which would risefar less steeply than spending on conservation programs. Thedepartment also would expand research to find ways to boostdomestic oil output.   Such initiatives, however, are dwarfed by spending at thedepartment's atomic weapons complex, where environmentaltroubles continue to be a high priority. The department isseeking a $623 million supplemental appropriation for thecurrent fiscal year that includes $340 million for overallenvironmental management and $283 million earmarkedspecifically for the Rocky Flats facility in Colorado. Nextyear, overall spending for environmental restoration andwaste management would increase 49% to $3.69 billlion from$2.47 billion.   In a break from previous years, the department is seekingfunds for only one new reactor to produce tritium -- aperishable gas that enhances the power of nuclear bombs --rather than two. A program to use advanced laser technologyto enrich uranium for nuclear weapons is being shelved.   Spending for research on global climate change wouldincrease significantly, as would funds for the atom-smashingsuperconducting supercollider. Total outlays for the agencywould increase to $17.33 billion from $15.88 billion.   -- Rose Gutfeld                                                                                                          Space and Science                                                                                                          Spending by the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration would increase by 9% to $14.72 billion. Thatreflects a new NASA-Defense Department program to develop alaunch system to carry heavy loads into space and slightlyhigher funding for the space station.   The president also requests a substantial increase forNASA's space-science programs, including astronomy, unmannedplanetary exploration and life sciences. Spending would beboosted for the Mission to Planet Earth program, which usesspace-based platforms and small satellites to monitor climatechanges, ocean surfaces and other data.   The budget seeks to bolster research and developmentspending. Funding for the National Science Foundation, animportant source of grants, would rise substantially, aswould spending for the Human Genome Project, which isdesigned to map the genes in the human body. The budget alsoproposes a new, $50 million program to provide universityresearchers with state-of-the-art instrumentation, and makingpermanent the research and experimentation tax credit.   The administration also requests $149 million for aninteragency program on high-performance computing andcommunications. It aims to sharply improve the nation'scomputing capability by 1996.   The president also seeks increased spending forbiotechnology and for science and mathematics education.   -- Laurie McGinley                                                                                                          Law Enforcement                                                                                                          The president proposes to increase spending for lawenforcement by $1.9 billion to $14.5 billion, with emphasison prison-building and anti-drug programs.   Mr. Bush is requesting $2.6 billion, a 63% increase, forprison expansion and operation. The administration plans toadd 5,900 federal prison beds, bringing the total to 65,900.   The president wants Congress to provide $11.7 billion, an11% increase, for anti-drug programs, includinglaw-enforcement, treatment and prevention efforts, and aid toother countries. Drug-related law enforcement would get itsthird annual increase; interagency drug task forces wouldreceive a 13% boost, to $363 million, while the DrugEnforcement Administration would receive an 8% increase, to$690 million. The actual level of international aid willdepend partly on whether countries such as Peru comply withU.S. conditions.   Most other parts of the justice system would get smallerincreases than drug programs. Investigative activities, suchas those of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, wouldreceive a 9% increase, to $6.2 billion. The judiciary andprosecutors would get an 11% boost, to $5 billion. TheImmigration and Naturalization Service, which is strugglingto handle a surge in smuggling and other crimes by aliens,would receive $1.3 billion, an 8% increase.   The Justice Department accounts for more than two-thirdsof all law-enforcement spending, or $10 billion, with theTreasury Department and other agencies spending smalleramounts.   -- Paul M. Barrett                                                                                                          Health                                                                                                          The budget seeks to constrain exploding health costs bycurbing spending on Medicare, the federal health-insuranceprogram for the elderly and disabled, and devoting moreresources to preventive health care.   It increases Medicare premiums for wealthy seniorcitizens. Individuals with adjusted gross incomes of morethan $125,000 -- or over $150,000 for couples -- would pay amonthly premium of about $95 for the part of Medicare thatcovers physician and outpatient services. Those below theincome threshold would pay $31.80 a month.   The plan also crops Medicare $2.85 billion beyond thefiscal 1992 cuts painfully negotiated in last fall'sdeficit-reduction agreement, and it pares an additional $25.2billion from the program through fiscal 1996. The five-yeardeficit-cutting accord stipulated Medicare savings of $42billion between fiscal 1991 and 1995. Nevertheless, Medicarespending will grow 11.9% to $127.3 billion.   In a further effort to contain costs, the budget includesa proposal to expand enrollment of Medicare beneficiaries inhealth maintenance organizations.   The budget includes an array of programs to enhance thehealth of children, including a $100 million increase infunding for Head Start, the social services program forlow-income pre-school children, to $2.05 billion and an 18%increase in a nutrition program for low-income women andchildren to age five, to $2.6 billion. It proposes $171million to fight infant mortality in 10 cities, and a 19%increase in immunization services to $258 million.   -- Hilary Stout                                                                                                          Transportation                                                                                                          Spending on aviation and highways would increase, butstates would have to pick up a bigger portion of theroad-building and mass-transit tab.   Total Transportation Department outlays in fiscal year1992 would be $31.99 billion, up 3.9% from this year.   Outlays for highways would rise to $15.37 billion from$14.44 billion. Slightly higher mass-transit spending wouldbe authorized, although actual transit outlays are projectedto decline to $3.52 billion from $4.05 billion.   In a reorganization of surface-transportation programs,the president proposes spending $83 billion on highways and$16.7 billion on mass transit over the next five years. Thefederal government generally would pay 75% or less of thecost for projects in a 150,000-mile network of majorhighways, designated the &quot;National Highway System.&quot; It wouldcontinue to pay 90% for maintenance of interstate highways,though.   A highway block-grant program would consolidate spendinginvolving urban, primary and secondary roads; Washingtonwould pay 60% of the cost of work on such roads, but statescould use the money for mass transit.   The federal government would pay 60% or less of the costof qualifying mass-transit projects, down from 80%.   Outlays for Amtrak, the national passenger railroad, wouldfall to $410.1 million from $481.4 for 1991. The FederalAviation Administration's outlays would rise to $7.97 billionfrom $7.42 billion, and 450 air traffic controllers would beadded.   -- Laurie McGinley                                                                                                          Agriculture                                                                                                          Agriculture Department spending, including $15.3 billionfor various farm programs, would rise less than 1% to $55.7billion as increases in food assistance for the needy morethan offset cuts in farm credit.   The administration proposes spending $30.2 billion on foodstamps and nutrition programs -- a $2 billion increase fromthis fiscal year -- to meet growing demand for foodassistance and to improve the diets of 175,000 additionalwomen, infants and children living in poverty. Farmers HomeAdministration outlays, meanwhile, would fall 28% to $3.9billion as the administration lowers lending levels andcontinues to shift from direct loans to guaranteed loans.   Spending on farm-income supports and other subsidies wouldrise by $235 million to $11.1 billion. The projected increasewould have been considerably larger if Congress hadn'tlowered the so-called target prices, the pegs for calculatingsubsidies for major crops. Spending on federal crop insurancewould slip slightly to $859 million under a proposal to cutinsurance-premium subsidies to farmers.   In addition, the administration plans to save $50 millionannually by having meat and poultry plants bear a greatershare of the costs of inspecting their products. Theadministration also proposes spending 16% more onrecreational facilities in the national forests to easecrowding in national parks.   -- Bruce Ingersoll                                                                                                          Employment                                                                                                          Spending would rise for workers who have lost their jobs,but little change is planned for most job training programs.   The first Pentagon-provided domestic &quot;conversion&quot; funds --$150 million -- would aid workers laid off by defensecutbacks. And a $92 million increase, to $501 million inoutlays, is planned to retrain other dislocated workers andhelp them find jobs.   Outlays would ease 1% to $2.43 billion for basic JobTraining Partnership Act youth and young-adult education andtraining. The administration proposes, as it did a year ago,to combine JTPA summer-youth and youth-training into ayear-round youth program. Spending for the separate Job Corpswould be boosted 9% to $864 million as construction workexpands on two new centers in Kansas and Alabama; fundingwould be shelved for four other planned centers.   Workers laid off because of the Clean Air Act, enactedlate last year, would receive help from $50 million in fundsearmarked for a new program. The president proposes -- as hedid last year but which stalled in Congress -- to provide $25million this year for urban and rural projects to help themost disadvantaged youths and prevent school dropouts under anew &quot;Youth Opportunity Unlimited&quot; program.   Funds to pay paperwork costs that states face asunemployment-compensation claims climb sharply would beincreased 14% in two steps, during fiscal 1991 and 1992. Thebudget estimates a 3.1% claims rate in fiscal 1991 and a 3%rate in fiscal 1992. The rate of jobless-pay claims has been2.8% to 2.9% recently, up from about 2.3% through much oflast year.   -- Albert R. Karr                                                                                                          Foreign Aid                                                                                                          State Department and foreign-aid expenditures would growto $19.6 billion next year from $18.7 billion this year,including an expected rise in aid to Turkey and a newinitiative for Latin America.   The president says in his budget that this year's &quot;mostcritical security need&quot; is support for U.S. allies in thePersian Gulf war, but fiscal austerity will limit theincreases. While details are yet to be worked out, adepartment official says military aid to Turkey could grow25% to about $625 million, and economic assistance to Ankaramay be increased 50% to about $75 million. The budget alsocites the needs of Egypt and Israel, but the official saysincreases aren't likely for those two nations, which alreadyare the largest recipients of U.S. aid.   The budget would allocate $309 million in new spending fora debt-reduction program for Latin America, which wasannounced last June by President Bush. The goals of the neweffort include establishing a new hemispherewide free-tradezone and promoting private investment in Latin America.
