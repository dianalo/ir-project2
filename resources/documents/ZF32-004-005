(TechTalk) (Column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Gibson, Steve.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Microcomputer system crashes are more likely to result fromsoftware problems than from hardware failures.andP;  Some of the mostcommon difficulties are in the systems software and result fromwhat are known as hardware interrupts.andP;  Intel Corp'smicroprocessors provide an 'Interrupt Request Line' so thatcontrol can be switched for tiny amounts of time from theapplication in use in the foreground to interrupt utilities.andO;These interrupts occur so that the system can handle a number ofnearly simultaneous tasks such as running a printer, managing thekeyboard type-ahead buffer and the hard disk cache, and keepingtrack of memory-resident software.andP;  Theoretically, the interruptservice routines (ISRs) should return control to the program inuse with the system in precisely the same status as it was whenthe ISR took control, except for the task completed.andP;  This processdoes not always work as designed; system crashes can result.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Systems softwareInterruptsSystem CrashMicrocomputers.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
