What's more, department spokesman Richard Boucher said, theSoviets themselves continue to send other military equipment toNicaragua.   Responding to persistent U.S. appeals for a cut-off in supportto the Sandinistas, who are battling American-backed Contrainsurgents, Gorbachev wrote Bush earlier this month that he hadsuspended Soviet weapons shipments on Jan. 1 and would not resumethem.   But U.S. officials told The Associated Press Monday that theSoviet leader had declined to end other military support, such asvehicles, and would not impede Cuban deliveries of weapons toNicaragua.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater on Tuesday dismissedGorbachev as a ``drugstore cowboy,'' suggesting there was more showthan substance in his letter to Bush.   Other U.S. officials passed the word to reporters that 17shipments of military goods had reached Nicaragua, but declined tosay whether they came from the Soviet Union, its Eastern Europeanallies or Cuba, and whether or not weapons were included.   Then, on Wednesday, the State Department confirmed Gorbachev'sletter _ although insisting that the pattern of Soviet bloc aid toNicaragua had not changed. By the department's own account,however, the Soviets themselves had stopped sending weapons _ asGorbachev had told Bush was the case.   Boucher said that 27 shipments of military goods were sent toNicaragua from the Soviet Union and its allies in the first fourmonths of the year and that the estimated value of shipmentsthrough March was about $80 million.   Boucher said that over the four-month period arms were suppluedby Eastern European countries and Cuba, with the Soviets providingunspecificed other military materiel.   ``The general secretary indicated in his letter that the Sovietshave stopped sending weapons to Nicaragua,'' Boucher said, therebyconfirming Gorbachev's pledge as reported Monday night by TheWashington Post and The Associated Press.   The spokesman added: ``In sum, the level and pattern of deliveryso far is very siumilar to that of 1988 _ that is, militarysupplies delivered by the Soviets and weapons and lethal equipmentdelivered by their Cubans and East European clients.''   In past years, though, the United States said the Soviets wereproviding both weapons and other military equipment to Nicaragua.The aid totaled an estimated $515 million last year.   Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, the chairman of the House ArmedServices Committee chastised the White House for its statementsabout Gorbachev and accused administration officials of lacking``vision'' in meeting the Soviet leader's arms control challenges.   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., alluded to statements by Fitzwater.Besides calling Gorbachev a ``drugstore cowboy,'' the spokesmansaid the administration was ``leery'' of the Soviet leader'spromise to halt military aid to Nicaragua.   ``I don't think you ought to run down the Gorbachev proposals. Idon't think the kind of statements Marlin Fitzwater is making arehelpful,'' Aspin told two administration officials at a hearing byhis committee.   The administration contends that many of Gorbachev'sinitiatives, such as his recent offering to withdraw 500short-range nuclear weapons from Eastern Europe, have been designedto glean publicity and were not actually substantial when viewedagainst the overwhelming superiority of Warsaw Pact forces inEurope.   But Aspin argued that the administration was being outflanked bythe Soviet leader's ability to win the public relations war,particularly among U.S. allies in Western Europe.   Aspin and several other Democrats complained to Paul Wolfowitz,undersecretary of defense for policy, and Reginald Bartholomew,undersecretary of state for security assistance, that theadministration was losing that fight because it has not respondedswiftly enough to Gorbachev's various arms control proposals, norwith enough imagination.   Wolfowitz and Bartholomew countered that the administration wasbeing cautious in areas where such restraint was deemed asnecessary, and had put forward serious and far-reaching proposalsto trim the conventional forces in Europe, which the Soviets arenow just coming around to meet.</TEXT></DOC>
