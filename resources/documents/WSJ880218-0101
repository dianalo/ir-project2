His withdrawal comes after a fifth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses and a sixth-place finish in this week's New Hampshire primary.    &quot;There's a point at which you become not the conscience of the debate but just irrelevant,&quot; says Mr. Babbitt. &quot;The better part of wisdom is bowing gracefully and saying thank you and going home to reorder your life.&quot;    During this final flight Mr. Babbitt, who never broke into the top tier of Democratic contenders, talked about the twin difficulties of campaigning on behalf of an unpopular idea -- a consumption tax to help balance the budget -- and of introducing new policy ideas in the middle of the campaign.    &quot;A political campaign is the wrong place to raise new ideas,&quot; he says. &quot;I now understand, after a year and a half, that a campaign is an outreach process that has to start with ideas that are already in the dialogue.&quot;    So all-but-ignored in the 1988 campaign were his notions of instituting tax changes to encourage performance pay for all employees, providing universal child-care vouchers, making the Social Security benefits of the wealthy subject to taxation, and requiring that companies receiving government financial assistance give partial ownership and control to employees.    &quot;These were simply too broad and too new to gel in the course of the campaign,&quot; he says. &quot;I now know that you can't walk into a presidential race and spring these kinds of things on people.&quot;    The only Babbitt idea that won substantial attention was his 5% consumption tax, the centerpiece of his plan to eliminate the federal budget deficit. In small meetings in Iowa farmhouses, before business groups, at college campuses and in the parade of debates that have marked this year's campaigns, Mr. Babbitt trumpeted his plan, hoping to make a virtue of his courage and candor in offering to increase taxes.    It didn't work. His Democratic rivals raced to brand the idea as regressive, with Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee even describing it as a Republican idea. Mr. Babbitt's pleas for honesty in approaching the nation's budget problems began to sound like a dirge. And this week, in New Hampshire, three-fifths of the Democratic voters surveyed in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll said they disapproved of the consumption-tax idea.    Mr. Babbitt says the negative reaction to the tax proposal didn't surprise him. But he calculated that if the campaign of a relatively unknown former governor were to attract attention at all, it would have to be because he proffered unusual ideas.    &quot;I knew it would be a hard sell to go to the nation and say I should be president because I've been a great governor of Arizona,&quot; he says. &quot;That message didn't have a lot of heft to it. I knew well that I had to run with something else.&quot;    Mr. Babbitt's first stumble along the campaign trail was his poor performance during a televised debate last July. But unlike other politicians who have struggled with television, Mr. Babbitt harbors no resentment.    &quot;Television is a mysterious, incomprehensible barrier at first,&quot; he says. &quot;But if you learn to be your own editor, you can get across your message, even in 20-second bites. A candidate has extraordinary control when he's using television.&quot;    Nor does he believe the process of selecting a president -- Mr. Babbitt had spent 31 days in Iowa and 21 in New Hampshire before he formally declared his candidacy nearly a year ago -- is too long. &quot;We have had for 200 years a system in which there is no predictable course to the presidency,&quot; he says. &quot;As long as it's a random and diverse process, it must be long.&quot;    Even so, Mr. Babbitt won't miss the rigors of the road. &quot;It's a wretched existence, these endless days awakening in motels where you don't even know where you are and eating turkey sandwiches twice a day in a van talking to some local newspaper editor,&quot; he says.    He leaves the race discouraged about the debate that he says isn't being conducted. &quot;We are still, on both sides, running a presidential campaign that is avoiding reality,&quot; he says. &quot;It's run on the premise that we can't have an honest dialogue about the economic changes we need. And the election results have done nothing to encourage risk-taking.&quot;    Mr. Babbitt, who says he doesn't plan to endorse any other candidate in the near future, expects to spend a few days in Washington before returning to Phoenix. His son wants to visit the White House. </TEXT></DOC>
