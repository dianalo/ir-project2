Lawrence G. Rawl, chairman, told securities analysts at a meeting yesterday that Exxon will spend about $6.5 billion this year, compared with $5.2 billion, excluding acquisitions, in 1987. Last year, the company spent a total of about $7 billion on capital projects and acquisitions combined.    More than half of the oil giant's budget will go toward exploration and production business. The company expects to spend slightly more this year than the $3.5 billion it devoted to this sector last year.    Exxon will invest only $1.8 billion in its less-profitable refining and marketing business. Last year, Exxon spent $1.6 billion on refining and marketing.    Mr. Rawl said he expects crude-oil prices to rise to about $18 a barrel in the months ahead from current levels of about $15 a barrel. Reports that the monitoring committee of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries might meet to discuss the current decline in oil prices are &quot;encouraging,&quot; he said.    He expects oil prices to &quot;fluctuate&quot; near $18 a barrel until the early 1990s, when declining production and increasing demand will cause prices to climb. Prices could rise to $35 a barrel by 1995, he said.    According to Don McIvoy, an Exxon senior vice president, the company replaced 114% of its oil and gas production last year, a figure that exceeds the replacement rate of most oil companies.    Mr. Rawl said Exxon is looking to make acquisitions this year, both companies or oil and gas properties. &quot;We'd buy anything&quot; that's attractive, he said. However, he appeared to rule out any outright purchase of Texaco Inc. &quot;We know a lot about the old Texaco, but we don't know much about the new Texaco,&quot; he said. &quot;That company's got some real problems.&quot;    When asked if he would join with New York investor Carl C. Icahn in a friendly bid for Texaco, Mr. Rawl said: &quot;I wouldn't join with anyone in a bid. And what do I need Carl Icahn for anyway?&quot;    Exxon officials declined to project earnings. But they were gloomy about prospects for the refining and marketing business. Earnings for that sector of the oil industry have fallen sharply in the past year as competition in the retail sector has stiffened.    &quot;We see no letup in competition,&quot; said Lee Raymond, Exxon's president. &quot;Things don't bode well for downstream (refining and marketing) earnings. </TEXT></DOC>
