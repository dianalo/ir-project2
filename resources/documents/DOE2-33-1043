<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-33-1043 </DOCNO><TEXT>Previous authors have proposed a practical way of incorporating the collectiveeffect of multigluon emissions in the description of transverse momentumdistributions in perturbative QCD. To investigate the validity of thiswe implement a simplified ansatz for the two-gluon contribution basedon their algorithm and calculate the Qsub(T) distribution for four-jetevents in e/sup +/e/sup -/ annihilation. We find that, for realisticvalues of the jet-defining cuts, there is a significant kinematic regionin which this simple model agrees reasonably well with the exact O(sub(s)a/sup2/) result. This not only supports the claim that their multigluon sumis an accurate prediction of perturbative QCD but allows the impliedindividual multijet cross sections, and especially their virtual corrections,to be calculated simply.</TEXT></DOC>
