SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Shoppers have virtually emptied StateStore 122 of its goods because the switch to a market economy isdriving prices up and Poles figure everything will cost more nextweek.   ``I had heaps of sugar and flour, enough to last three months,but when the year came to an end people bought everything outwithin a week,'' said Teresa Sasin, who manages the food store.   ``The day after New Year's I had a delivery of 500 kilos (1,100pounds) of sugar and it was sold out within an hour,'' she said,gesturing toward the empty shelves. ``Same with eggs. Ten crateswere sold out in an hour.''   Similar scenes have been reported in state-run grocery and meatstores around the nation Thursday as customers stock up beforeprices are raised again. Some stores closed because they hadnothing more to sell.   Prices have been freed as part of a radical economic plandesigned by the Solidarity-led government to end central economiccontrol and subsidies and, after an initial spurt in prices, haltthe inflation that has plagued the moribund economy.   Electricity went up 600 percent and the price of gasolinedoubled this week alone.   Food prices are supposed to rise more gradually _ from 25 to 50percent a month _ to cushion the shock. Prices increased this weekin stores that received deliveries based on new prices for January,but others still were selling goods at last year's prices.   Private and cooperative groceries, which charge higher pricesthan state stores, also were crowded.   ``We're still operating on old prices so people are buyingeverything they can get their hands on,'' said Jadwiga Dzierecka,director of Agricoop No. 1 in Warsaw.   The Agricoop chain is a cooperative soon to be become a stockcompany under economic legislation passed by Parliament last week.Its stores sell an array of cheeses, fresh produce and importedfoods, including canned shrimp and Italian pasta and olive oil.   ``Our products are so attractive that people still buy,'' Ms.Dzierzecka told a reporter between telephone conversations withsuppliers.   Halina Samsel, co-owner of a vegetable stand in Warsaw's busyHala Mirowska market, said she had raised prices but was confidentpeople would continue to buy.   She was charging $1.90 a kilo (2.2 pounds) for tomatoes, 17cents a head for lettuce and 84 cents a kilo for fresh mushrooms.Average monthly pay in Poland is about $37, or 350,000 zlotys.   Ms. Samsel said with a smile: ``The prices are shocking.Customers get upset. They are not used to them, but they buy. Thereis no other way out.''   Jan Kubajek, sales director of a wholesale supply house run bythe state, said Thursday: ``This unrestrained way of introducingnew prices is unacceptable. Retail firms don't have enough money,so they are delaying payment and we'll have to limit deliveries.''   Kubajek said his warehouse supplies sugar and flour to more thanhalf the city. He said enough stocks are on hand for current needs,but he expects problems later.   ``Prices for many social groups will be unacceptable,'' he said,which means sales will decline and many stores may have to close.   Agriculture Minister Czeslaw Janicki told the newspaper ZycieWarszawy in an interview published Thursday there would be nointerruption of food supplies.   ``There are no rational reasons to fear this,'' he said. ``Thereare no disturbances in food production.''   Janicki acknowledged, however, that Poland had to import 300,000tons of grain in January and that meat reserves had fallen to65,000 tons, half the nation's monthly consumption.   Farmers have complained about the rising costs of fuel andelectricity.   ``The avalanche of price hikes has already started and this isonly the beginning,'' Tadeusz Zablocki, a farmer from the Balticcoast, told the newspaper Dziennik Ludowy. ``Production costs inagriculture will increase enormously.''   Butcher shops often are empty by early afternoon.   ``There is a real problem with meat,'' Ms. Sasin said. ``It wasthe worst holiday season I can remember in years as far as meat andsausage go.''   Janicki said he hoped farmers would begin selling their reservessoon. Many farmers have held products off the market, waiting forprice increases.</TEXT></DOC>
