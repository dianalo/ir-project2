At least 14 people died and 36 others were wounded in thefive-hour assault on the Bourj el-Barajneh refugee camp, policesaid. According to police count, 174 people have been killed and665 wounded since the fighting broke out May 1.   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standingregulations, said the dissident Fatah-Uprising faction backed by afierce mortar and rocket barrage moved into western and southernsectors of the camp.   Arafat's fighters were cornered on the eastern side of thedevastated camp.   Fighting died down about midday. Reporters who visited the campsaw Mousa's jubilant guerrillas cleaning debris from the mainstreet.   The commander of Fatah in the camp, Sultan Abul-Ainen, askedleftist Lebanese militia leaders to ``guarantee the safeevacuation'' of his men, estimated at about 100, police said.   The police spokesman said leaders of the Druse ProgressiveSocialist Party, the Lebanese Communist Party and the Syrian SocialNationalist Party have ``agreed to sponsor the evacuation.'' Notimetable has been announced yet, he said.   Arafat has been trying for three years to rebuild the power basehe lost after Israel's invaded Lebanon in 1982.   His fighters pushed Mousa's faction out of Bourj el-Barajneh anda nearby camp, Chatilla, in early May.   But the dissidents regrouped and began shelling the camps withartillery, rockets and heavy mortars from Syrian-held positions inthe mountains surrounding Beirut. The camps already were devastatedby attacks from Israelis, Lebanese Christians and Syrian-backedShiite Moslem militiamen in the last six years.   Fatah-Uprising fighters, led by Col. Saeed Mousa, forced Arafatloyalists out of Chatilla on June 27.   Arafat's guerrillas had repulsed at least 21 major attacks sinceMonday, when fighting flared after a weeklong lull in the powerstruggle for control of the camps.   But Arafat's fighters lacked the heavy weapons to retaliate forthe daily shelling.   The police spokesman said Arafat's guerrillas would probably bedriven in police buses to the port city of Sidon, 25 miles south ofBeirut, where the Palestine Liberation Organization has bases.   Syrian soldiers would escort the guerrillas to the Awali bridgejust north of Sidon, he added. The bridge is the Syrian army'ssouthernmost position in Lebanon.   The camp, which once housed more than 40,000 refugees, was inruins. Not a single shack has escaped the shellfire.   The four-story Haifa Hospital, the camp's only medical center,has been shelled repeatedly. All its doors and windows were blownout.   Hospital beds and other equipment were scattered in the street,apparently hurled there by the blast of exploding shells. Thehospital was evacuated Tuesday.   The few civilians who remained in Bourj el-Barajneh were seenpacking up what was left of their households and fleeing throughthe smoking rubble.   ``We're proud Palestinians. We don't want to live with traitors.We will go wherever the PLO can take care of us,'' said a woman whoidentified herself only as Fawziyeh.   Mousa and other radical factions broke away from the PalestineLiberation Organization in a 1983 Syrian-backed mutiny andestablished headquarters in Damascus.   The power struggle between Fatah and Mousa's guerrillas eruptedless than a week after Arafat flew to Damascus for a reconciliationwith President Hafez Assad of Syria to end a 5-year-old feud overcontrol of the Palestinian movement.   The PLO has claimed that Syria was behind the latest fighting todrive Arafat's forces out of Beirut.   Arafat's men have regrouped in bases in Palestinian camps insouth Lebanon, which is dominated by Shiite Moslems, raising thespecter of more violence.</TEXT></DOC>
