(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A panel of independent and drug industryscientists began today trying to hasten the process for approvingnew drugs to treat cancer and AIDS, a task its chairman says mustbalance patient safety against the need for speedy treatment.   ``While safety and efficacy must remain of paramount importancein permitting the use of new drugs, it is also critical that theFood and Drug Administration's regulatory procedures be such as tonot unduly hinder the rapid transfer of new agents to patients withcancer and AIDS,'' said Dr. Armand Hammer, chairman of thePresident's Cancer Panel, which appointed the drug study panel.   Hammer said the panel of experts has been asked byPresident-elect Bush to review current drug approval procedures anddetermine whether the regulatory processes governing cancer and AIDSdrugs should be different from the processes governing developmentof drugs for diseases that are not life-threatening.   Speaking to reporters after his address to the panel meeting atthe National Institutes of Health, Hammer said he believes theapproval process for cancer and AIDS drugs should be shortened fromthe current period, which varies from two to three years, to lessthan one year.   ``We're not going to sacrifice safety and speed,'' he said.``We're going to combine safety and speed.''   Hammer said the FDA's recent announcement of new streamlinedprocedures to move drug approvals more quickly are inadequate,though he did not elaborate.   However, he said, the involvement of leading pharmaceutical andbiotechnology companies on the study panel will provide valuableinsight into the approval process.   Dr. Anthony Fauci, the AIDS coordinator at the NationalInstitutes of Health, said ``extraordinary'' progress has alreadybeen made in AIDS research, though no cure has been found and onlyone drug has been approved for treatment of AIDS _ AZT, which hasbeen shown to prolong the lives of certain AIDS patients.   ``There is a lot of despair out there, and that's understandablebecause of the terrible scourge of this disease,'' he told panelists.   He said scientists are ``cautiously optimistic'' that they willdevelop a drug or combination of drugs within the next few years toprolong the lives of AIDS victims. However, he said, there isunlikely that a single drug will be developed that cures the disease.</TEXT></DOC>
