The Yunis Khalis rebel force, a Moslem fundamentalist faction,said its guerrillas killed 60 Afghan troops and captured 60 otherssince Thursday in fighting west of Khost, 18 miles from the Pakistanborder.   A spokesman for another guerrilla faction, the Jamiat-e-Islami,said guerrilla forces had recently closed a 36-mile section of theSalang highway north of Kabul.   The mountainous, 260-mile road is the capital's main overlandlink with the Soviet Union.   Earlier this year, the Communists built an alternate road forpart of the way to divert convoys during guerrilla strikes.   The Khalis claimed to have captured three military posts, fourtanks, and a large quantity of ammunition.   ``This is part of a new offensive to capture the Khost area,''said Shah Mohammad, a Khalis officer at the party's headquarters inPeshawar, Pakistan.   Another Khalis spokesman said about 10 guerrillas were killed and20 were wounded.   There was no independent confirmation. Official Radio Kabul,monitored in Islamabad, has daily reported dozens of guerrillacasualties along the eastern front.   Both sides usually make conflicting claims.   The guerrillas, who are backed mainly by Pakistan and the UnitedStates, have intensified rocket attacks on Kabul, Jalalabad andKandahar airports.   MIDIA, a rebel news agency, said 20 government soldiers werekilled and seven captured in a hit-and-run strike by guerrillas onFriday near Kandahar airport in the southeast.   The Marxist government claims the rebels are targeting civilianpopulations, causing hundreds of casualties. The insurgents deny thecharges.   The guerrillas have failed to capture a key Afghan city sinceSoviet troops ended nine years of intervention on the governmentside in Feb. 15. The Soviets continue to supply arms to the Afghangovernment.</TEXT></DOC>
