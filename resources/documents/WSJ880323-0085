Garcia (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> ITT S AET CI </CO><IN> INS </IN><TEXT>   Seven state attorneys general, citing dozens of alleged secret meetings, dinner parties and behind-the-scenes threats, charged four of the nation's largest insurers with conspiring to manipulate the availability and cost of commercial liability coverage.    In separate antitrust lawsuits filed in federal court in San Francisco, the top prosecutors of Alabama, California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, West Virginia and Wisconsin alleged that a conspiracy of giant insurance companies caused the so-called liability crisis earlier this decade by colluding to jack up prices and limit the scope of insurance coverage. The basic thrust of the accusations is that a few of the largest insurers jointly pressured the rest of the industry to go along with certain policy-writing changes that made it much tougher for public agencies, businesses and nonprofit organizations to buy liability insurance.    Named as defendants in the suits were Hartford Fire Insurance Co., Hartford Conn., a unit of ITT Corp.; Allstate Insurance Co., Northbrook, Ill., a unit of Sears, Roebuck and Co.; Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co., also in Hartford, and Cigna Corp., Philadelphia. Also named were the Insurance Services Office Inc., a New York-based trade group, and a number of major London-based reinsurance companies and their U.S. brokers.    Insurance companies have a special exemption from federal and most state antitrust laws, as a result of their peculiar need to share actuary information. While that immunity allows the industry to engage in price-fixing, however, it explicitly proscribes acts of &quot;boycott, coercion or intimidation.&quot; The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1978 that insurers could be liable for antitrust violations when they conspire to boycott certain customers.    In news conferences across the country, the seven attorneys general denounced the alleged conspirators, blaming them for afflicting day-care centers, recreational facilities and other public and private services with unnecessary anguish and in some cases, bankruptcy.    &quot;International conspiracies resulted in policies so shrunken in scope, so reduced in value to the customer, that they can hardly be described as insurance at all,&quot; said New York Attorney General Robert Abrams.    California's attorney general, John Van de Kamp, said: &quot;It was the public and the consumer who paid the price for this collusive exercise in corporate greed.&quot;    A spokesman for Aetna Life called the action &quot;another political move by political officeholders who have consistently opposed any and all efforts to address the real problems of the nation's liability system.&quot; The spokesman added that &quot;any business decisions made by Aetna executives are made independently.&quot;    A spokesman for Allstate said the company hadn't seen the suit but stressed that &quot;Allstate is not now, and never has been, involved in a conspiracy to fix prices or constrain the market.&quot;    A Cigna spokesman said the company doesn't comment on litigation, but pointed out that Cigna's policy is to conduct business &quot;in conformity with all state, federal and foreign antitrust laws.&quot;    Stephen Martin, vice president for government relations at Hartford, said, &quot;These charges are totally without substance.&quot;    In New York, a spokesman for the Insurance Services Office, the trade group that coordinates industrywide policy standards and that is alleged in the suits to have been a focal point of the conspiracy, called the accusations &quot;unfounded and meritless.&quot; He added that the group has &quot;conducted its operations properly and legally.&quot;    Other investigations of the insurance industry have found no evidence of collusion. For example, a Justice Department report issued a year ago called such a conspiracy &quot;implausible.&quot;    The crux of the prosecutors' claims, which probably will be heard all together by U.S. District Court Judge William Schwarzer, is that Hartford, Cigna, Aetna, Allstate and the London-based reinsurers jointly pressured the Insurance Services Office and its member companies into revising certain standard forms used for writing commercial liability policies.    Specifically, the suits allege that the conspirators, using &quot;boycotts, threats, intimidation and other coercive conduct,&quot; forced the industry into abandoning traditional &quot;occurrence&quot; coverage, under which a person could collect for losses even after a policy had expired, as long as those losses occurred during the policy's term. Instead, without lowering premium rates, the industry changed to so-called claims-made policies, which compensate only for losses actually claimed during the policy term.    Likewise, the suits charge the companies with conspiring to add so-called retrodates to policies, limiting insurers' liability to losses occurring after specified times, typically the starting date of a policy. The claims-made and retro-date changes narrow the risk for insurance companies by eliminating liability for chronic injuries that may not surface until years after they occur.    Also, the prosecutors allege that the companies, particularly the British reinsurers, boycotted writing any policies for pollution liability, causing a drastic shortage of that type of insurance.    As evidence for their claims, the attorneys general included a 17-page section in their complaints, under the heading of &quot;facts,&quot; describing a three-year series of meetings and agreements among major insurance executives. Thomas Dove, the lawyer in the California attorney general's office who spearheaded the two-year, multistate investigation, pointed out that unlike in many suits, the prosecutors' assertions aren't prefaced with the cautionary words, &quot;on information and belief.&quot;    &quot;We already have evidence in hand for every point in there,&quot; he said.    For example, the complaint quotes a memo written by a staff member of the Insurance Services Office about a meeting that took place at the Garrick Club in London on July 4, 1984. Attending that meeting, according to the suit, were representatives of &quot;leading&quot; British reinsurance companies who the staff member said were &quot;almost militant&quot; in demanding that U.S. liability policies be altered.    Less than three months later, the suit says, at a private dinner at the Board Room club in New York, the reinsurers informed the directors of the Insurance Services Office of their &quot;agreed positions&quot; that the coverage changes be made. The next day, at the Office's executive committee meeting, the directors voted to include many of the alterations being urged.    In another matter, the suit alleges that the major British reinsurers agreed at a London meeting on Nov. 6, 1985, to boycott writing any pollution policies for North American customers. &quot;We have the written and signed agreement,&quot; said Mr. Dove. </TEXT></DOC>
