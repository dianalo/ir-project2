 Now, what does the $795 packageoffer above and beyond the other databases evaluated here?andM;dBASE IV is almost completely managed by the Control Center, an interfacetool that lets you pick and choose from database objects like tables, views,forms, reports, label designs, and even programs.andP;  The Control Center letsyou easily switch from one module to another without wading through layers ofmenus as you would in Clarion, but it doesn't offer the ability to view filesin multiple, overlapping windows as FoxPro does, or even view query resultswhile operating the main menu as Paradox does.andP;  The interface cries out formouse support as well.andP;  The Label and Report Generators offer WYSIWYGinterfaces for designing labels and reports.andP;  If you prefer the old dBASE dotprompt, you can drop out of the Control Center at any time.andP;  END-USERATTRACTIONS dBASE [V offers a number of features that make it attractive toend users, particularly those users familiar with previous versions of thepackage.andP;  For instance, the query-by-example (QBE) module is integrated intothe Control Center and lets you search for sets of records by checking offthe fields you want to see in a QBE form.andP;  You can establish selectionconditions by entering simple expressions and formulas in a condition box andretrieve the corresponding rows with a few keystrokes.andP;  QBE will dynamicallyexpand the form's field widths as you type in expressions and let you usealiases for the names of output fields in the results.andP;  With the ability toperform calculations, multitable joins, summaries, and sorts, DBASE IV's QBEwill also let you execute partial and approximate searches.andM;Unfortunately, there are more than a few problems with the way DBASE IV's QBEis implemented.andP;  For instance, the QBE module doesn't actually perform asearch.andP;  Instead, it generates a DBASE language program that uses the SETFILTER TO and SET RELATION TO commands to establish the search conditions forretrieving the records and invokes dBASE to run this program.andP;  While thislets you reuse queries generated with QBE, there's no opportunity for dynamicquery optimization-as in Paradox-to take advantage of changes to therelationship between the desired records and the rest of the database.andM;Further, DBASE creates a view of the requested records, and if you BROWSEquery results derived from multiple tables, the results are read-only and youcannot modify them.andP;  Finally, DBASE insists that an index be available thatmatches the record search criteria.andP;  If you don't create the index, DBASE IVwill create one when you save the query, a process that consumes both timeand disk space.andP;  This is annoying when you're creating but not executing aquery.andP;  It's a crippling problem when you want to run ad hoc queries againsta large database.andM;On our benchmark tests, dBASE's results ranged from second best in OutputOverhead (because of their disk cache) and the top three for Selecting toslowest overall in some parts of the 100,000record Join test.andP;  In loading,indexing, projecting, and reporting, dBASE's results were average.andP;  SQLIMPLEMENTATION Like QBE, the Report Generator creates a dBASE program thatyou can run to produce reports.andP;  It will let you construct groups on all n'records, create breaks on field contents, and access multiply relateddatabase files.andP;  DBASE IV's SQL implementation offers set-oriented access toDBASE data files and uses DBASE files to implement a DB2-style systemcatalog.andP;  Unfortunately, SQL cannot execute as quickly as DBASE commands,since every SQL command has to be converted to dBASE first.andP;  Plus, it's easyto mix up dBASE and SQL commands that have the same name: DELETE and SELECThave different meanings in the two languages.andM;Developers will find that DBASE IV's most powerful features includeuser-defined functions (UDFs), commands to manipulate screen images, andconditional indexes.andP;  With UDFs, you can create your own functions andextensions to the DBASE language.andP;  You can use UDFs anywhere the systemaccepts a valid DBASE expression: in QBE, applications, calculated fields,and as arguments to commands or functions.andP;  This last use of UDFs is aninnovative facility that even FoxPro doesn't offer.andM;In addition, you can use any DBASE command or function in a UDF definition orin SQL mode, and even write recursively called UDFs.andP;  With DBASE IV'sconditional indexes, you can create an index that contains only keys forrecords that meet the FOR condition, thus creating a subset of the table'srecords and eliminating application search loops.andM;dBASE IV also offers automatic multi-user support, with both file- andrecord-locking and an autoretry facility for unlocking locked records.andO;Real-time screen refreshes are available via the auto-refresh facility.andP;  AndDBASE IV's multiple indexes use a single disk file to maintain up to 47different index keys, which are automatically opened and updated along withthe corresponding database file.andM;Despite these innovations, most of dBASE IV's features merely put it on parwith other databases.andP;  It's certainly not as easy to use as Paradox or aspowerful as FoxPro.andP;  Although it operates in only 450K RAM, DBASE IV doesn'tyet take advantage of expanded or extended memory.andP;  It does come with acustomized version of HyperWare's Hyper-Disk, a public domain disk-cachingprogram, which can itself reside outside of conventional memory.andP;  AlthoughHyper-Disk improves dBASE IV's performance considerably, you'll probably bebetter off disabling it and using a third-party cache utility likeMultiSoft's well-known Super PC-Kwik.andP;  What DBASE IV really needs is anintelligent memory manager like Paradox's VROOMM or the memory managementtechnology found in FoxPro.andM;The bottom line is that while DBASE IV has certainly caught up with the pack,there's no clear indication where it is leading us.andP;  In our comprehensiveevaluation of DBASE IV, Version 1.andP;  I (PC Magazine, January 29, 199 1 ), wesaid that the rebirth of DBASE IV means more competition and a promise todrive competitors to produce better database products for everyone, andeveryone who wants to stick with DBASE should upgrade.andP;  What's desperatelyneeded now are more and faster innovations like the few mentioned above.andO;Another two- or even one-year hiatus before the next version of DBASE will beunacceptable to the marketplace.andP;  So if you can't wait, check out FoxPro orone of the other databases evaluated here.andP;  You won't be disappointed.andP;  FACTFILE dBASE IV, Version 1.1 Ashton-Tate, 20101 Hamilton Ave., Torrance, CA90509;
