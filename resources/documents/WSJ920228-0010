Bob Kerrey of Nebraska in Georgia'spresidential primary Tuesday.   But Mr. Anderson, the county commissioner and a formerstate Democratic chairman, can't even keep his own family inline.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I'm a Democrat, but I'm going to vote for that fellaBuchanan,&quot; says brother Bill, a farmer, over ham and biscuitsat Miss Becky Mulligan's Town House restaurant. &quot;He's sayingwhat I want to hear.&quot;   Miss Becky is going to vote for Republican insurgentcandidate Patrick Buchanan, too. &quot;We're already this deep init,&quot; she says, pointing to her knees. &quot;And if Bush goes backin again, it will be up to here,&quot; pointing to her hips.   What's happening here is that Mr. Buchanan is makinginroads into the &quot;Bubba&quot; vote -- conservative whites, many ofthem Democrats, who because Georgia doesn't register votersby party are free to vote in the GOP primary. They are angryabout President Bush signing civil rights legislation thatthey say is a racial-quota bill. They rage about hisconcentration on international relations while neglectingproblems at home. They complain about his broken promise thathe wouldn't raise taxes. And some are appalled by federalarts grants to works and performances they considerpornographic or blasphemous. Mr. Buchanan, in TV and radioads and personal appearances, is playing to all theseconcerns.   The &quot;Bubba&quot; vote is critical for Mr. Buchanan. AmongRepublicans alone, he would probably be swamped by Bush votesfrom the country-club suburbs of Atlanta. But with the fiveDemocratic candidates failing to make much of a connectionwith voters here, &quot;Bubba&quot; and otherwise, Buchanan strategistssay they can tot up more than 30% of the GOP primary voteTuesday, once again embarrassing the president.   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, who needs a convincing victoryhere to demonstrate he can win big in his native South, isthe favorite among the Democrats. But he still has some bigconcerns -- how reports about his personal life and hisefforts to avoid being drafted during the Vietnam War play inthis conservative part of the country, for instance, andwhether the large turnout of black voters he anticipates willmaterialize.   Here in Hawkinsville, though, much of the talk is focusedon Mr. Bush -- and on antipathy toward him that extends tovoters of all persuasions. Mr. Buchanan seems to be pickingup the Rotary Club vote -- the votes of small businessmen whoworry about the declining economic fortunes of many of thesetowns and citiesas well as the white conservative workingvote. &quot;You won't find anyone for George Bush,&quot; says MarcusRewis, the town's 79-year-old banjo-strumming barber, &quot;andthat's the truth.&quot;   Surely, local Democrats say, Frank Dortch and his son,Peter, insurance agents, are backing Mr. Bush. After all,they're the most loyal Republicans in Hawkinsville. Butthey're walking out on the president too.   &quot;I know Buchanan opposed the war in the Gulf, and that's afactor,&quot; says Frank Dortch, &quot;But I'm still going to vote forBuchanan, as a protest.&quot; His son feels the same way: &quot;I'mvoting for Buchanan just to keep the president honest.&quot;   Druggist Tony Anderson is also a loyal Republican. He haswatched Mr. Bush's TV commercial featuring a former MarineCorps commandant, Gen. P.X. Kelley, attacking Mr. Buchananfor opposing the war in the Gulf and saying the last thingthe country needs is an isolationist in the White House. ButTony Anderson isn't voting for Mr. Buchanan to send him tothe White House. He's voting for him to send a conservative,get-back-to-basic-values message to Mr. Bush, and he doesn'tcare about Desert Storm. &quot;It doesn't matter at all,&quot; he says.   And it isn't just Mr. Bush's policies that people heredislike; more and more of them actively dislike him as aperson. &quot;We like Mrs. Bush,&quot; says Tom Blount, a farmhand.&quot;But we don't like him.&quot; Mr. Blount is voting for Mr.Buchanan.   David Beier, a political scientist at nearby MiddleGeorgia College and a Buchanan supporter, agrees that Mr.Bush's personal popularity has plummeted. &quot;People sense thateverything George Bush does is simply calculated to get himre-elected,&quot; he says.   For these voters disenchanted with Mr. Bush, this year'scrop of Democratic candidates isn't making much of a dent, atleast in this part of Georgia. &quot;They don't seem to haveanyone pumping iron,&quot; says Bill Anderson.   There is some support here for Gov. Clinton. &quot;Clinton'sgot the best chance to be president,&quot; says Ronald Fleeman, afarmer. &quot;He's in the mainstream.&quot; Bub Way, a local cardealer, supports Mr. Clinton too. &quot;He's aggressive, and werelate to him down here,&quot; he says.   But other voters aren't so sure. &quot;He's a pretty boy,&quot; saysBill Anderson. Bernadette Loftin, a retired historian fromMiddle Georgia College, says she worries that Mr. Clinton&quot;wants to do a lot of things that he won't be able to payfor.&quot; She's thinking of voting for former Sen. Paul Tsongasof Massachusetts, who in the past few days has quietly builtup credibility.   What hurts Mr. Clinton the most is his apparently findinga loophole to evade the Vietnam draft. It disturbs peoplehere who feel a strong attachment to the military. &quot;I justwould never vote for anybody who evaded the draft,&quot; saysJerry Cone from the Soil Conservation Service. Mr. Conefought in Vietnam and still is undergoing counseling forpost-trauma stress syndrome as a result.   Just outside town at the National Guard armory, First Sgt.E. Lee Bryant feels the same way. &quot;Bill Clinton's moralethics over his draft status are not acceptable to me,&quot; saysSgt. Bryant, who served in the regular Army before joiningthe Guard.   &quot;He won't get my vote, not for all those escapades,&quot;chimes in First Lt. Arnold Wright.   Both Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Tsongas appear poised tocapitalize on Mr. Clinton's problems. Sen. Kerrey, a Vietnamhero, has begun to hammer on the draft issue, accusing Mr.Clinton of a pattern of &quot;evasion of responsibility,&quot; deridinghis explanation of his draft situation as &quot;baloney&quot; anddeclaring: &quot;Had he wanted to go and serve his country, hecould have.&quot; Mr. Clinton would be &quot;opened up like a softpeanut&quot; by GOP attack strategists if he won the nomination,Mr. Kerrey has said.   To add to his burden, Mr. Clinton is counting on a heavyblack turnout that may not materialize. Neither he nor any ofthe other Democratic candidates is familiar to many of thevoters who worked enthusiastically for Jesse Jackson fouryears ago.   &quot;I go to a different {black} church every Sunday,&quot; saysJames Colson, a city councilman and an assistant principal atthe high school. &quot;Four years ago, the preachers were alltalking about Jesse Jackson. They're not talking aboutanybody now.&quot; Mr. Colson says he will vote for Gov. Clintonbut predicts the turnout by black voters will provedisappointing.   &quot;They're just not anybody any of us knows,&quot; says EffieOdom, a retired teacher and a member of the elected schoolboard. &quot;I guess those of us who vote will make up our mindsat the last minute.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
