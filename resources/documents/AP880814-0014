Angry residents demonstrated to demand an end to theviolence.   Protesters staged several attacks with firebombs to try and pushback thousands of police surrounding Yonsei University in the westof Seoul.   Troopers in green combat fatigues and black, visored helmetsfired volleys of tear gas and hurled rocks to drive students backin the third day of clashes at the school.   ``Advance nation unification'' and ``Yankees go home,'' studentschanted.   Students tried to stage a number of demonstrations in downtownSeoul, but the handfuls of protesters who showed up were dispersedquickly by hundreds of riot police.   Angry residents and shopkeepers staged several counter-proteststo demand students stop violent demonstrations. Some onlookers andpassersby heckled student demonstrations.   Some 3,000 students were at Yonsei to prepare for a march Mondayto the border truce village of Panmunjom for talks with NorthKorean student delegates on reuniting the divided Korean peninsula.   The government banned the march and the students have virtuallyno chance of getting past the heavy police cordon blocking them. Asimilar attempt to march to the border June 10 was blocked by riotpolice and turnouts at the latest protests have been smaller.   About 42,000 U.S. troops are in South Korea under a treaty andstudents contend Washington backs military rule in the country.   The peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end of WorldWar II. North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the KoreanWar.</TEXT></DOC>
