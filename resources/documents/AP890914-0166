John D. Dingell, the chief HouseDemocratic sponsor of President Bush's clean air bill, signaledThursday he propose relaxing the administration's stringent curbs onacid rain.   Dingell, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said hehad problems with a section of the acid rain plan that EnvironmentalProtection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly this week calledthe most crucial part of the proposal.   The move would place the Michigan Democrat in the unusualposition of opposing a key provision of the bill he is sponsoring.It also would change what environmentalists call the strongestportion of the Bush legislation.   Reilly said the administration opposed any attempt to weaken theprovision, which would ``cap'' emissions of sulfur dioxide, a keycomponent of acid rain. The chief Republican sponsor of thelegislation, Rep. Norman F. Lent, R-N.Y., said he favors retainingthe administration's language.   The ``cap'' would prevent sulfur dioxide emissions from growingagain after they are steadily reduced by a total of 10 million tonsover the next decade.   Sulfur dioxide combines with nitrogen oxide in the atmosphere andtravels for hundreds of miles before falling to earth, killingaquatic life in lakes and streams, damaging trees, decreasingvisibility and possibly harming human lungs.   Speaking before the Energy and Commerce environment subcommittee,Dingell said keeping the cap would prevent utilities from growing toserve new customers. It also would harm the high-sulfur coalindustry, which is cheap but fuels the dirtiest-burning utilities,he told the panel, which will begin considering amendments to theBush bill next week.   But ``loosening ... the cap,'' Dingell said, would reduce sulfurdioxide emissions ``without a severe impact on growth or on the useof coal in the next century.''   Power plants burning high-sulfur coal would bear the brunt of thesulfur dioxide reductions under the Bush legislation. The UnitedMine Workers union fears the utilities would reduce emissions thecheapest way, by switching to other fuels. The EPA estimates thatcould cost 17,000 jobs in the high-sulfur coal industry.   ``I am ... greatly concerned that unemployment in Appalachia willrise by enacting this ... bill,'' Dingell said. ``Clearly, thatshould not be an environmental, utility industry or federal goal.''   A Bush administration official, speaking only on condition he notbe named, said, ``We'll defend the president's position. We'll alsowork with the sponsors. We'll wait for specific changes and figureout how we'll react.''   While the ``cap'' would make it difficult for electric utilitiesto serve additional customers after the year 2000, there is aprovision to permit some growth. Utilities could accomplish this bybuying ``credits'' from utilities that exceeded their requiredreductions.   Dingell, a longtime champion of the auto industry, said,meanwhile, that he would vigorously fight any attempts to toughenBush's anti-pollution requirements for motor vehicles.   ``I would point out that all of the country does not have the airpollution problems of California,'' Dingell said. ``Yet, some,particularly in the Northeast, suggest that we should extend theentire California auto emissions program nationwide.   ``I would hope that my colleagues resist the temptation to singleout for punishment an industry that with its suppliers from theglass, steel, aluminum, plastics, rubber and mining industries,among others, employs millions in all the states.''</TEXT></DOC>
