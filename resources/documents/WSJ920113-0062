Onno Ruding, aconservative former finance minister of the Netherlands, to anew senior management post that will strengthen creditpolicies and add a highly regarded financial statesman to theexecutive ranks of the troubled banking company.   The new post is part of a management reorganization thatincludes broader responsibilites for President RichardBraddock and the resignation of Michael Callen, a 51-year-oldCiticorp director in charge of corporate lending andinvestment banking in Japan, Europe and North America, sayCiticorp insiders.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Callen yesterday confirmed he was leaving because&quot;There wasn't a major role for me in the reorganization.&quot; Headded that the parting is &quot;totally amicable.&quot; A Citicorpspokeswoman declined to comment.   The shake-up includes the establishment by Chairman JohnReed of a number of task forces of Citicorp executives tomanage problems and address issues more collegially. &quot;Theidea is to get people outside their own channels to solveproblems in other areas, including the global delivery ofCiticorp services,&quot; said one Citicorp executive. Mr. Reed wassaid to be discussing details of the reorganization inone-on-one meetings with Citicorp executives on Saturday.   The changes appear designed to strengthen Mr. Reed's handin carrying out his strategy for cutting expenses, buildingcapital and returning the bank to strong profitability. WithMr. Ruding at Mr. Reed's side, there's also likely to be lessspeculation that the board would move to replace him with amore disciplined financial expert. Mr. Reed, 52, took over aschief executive in 1984 after his gamble on consumer bankingtechnology turned Citibank into a leader in the field.   The management reorganization is expected to be announcedas soon as today. The appointment of the 52-year-old Dutchmanas the bank's third vice chairman is likely to be announcedafter Citicorp's next board meeting on Jan. 21, according toseveral Citicorp executives. As a foreign national, he mustbe approved by the Federal Reserve Board to assume a post asa bank director. That approval, which wasn't required for hisholding company directorship, is still pending, says oneCiticorp executive. Mr. Ruding didn't respond to severaltelephone messages left at his home and office.   Mr. Ruding is expected to be the strong hand that isneeded to institute and monitor stricter lending standards.He also is seen raising Citicorp's role in financialtransactions emerging from the unification of Europe andhelping to attract foreign capital as Citicorp reaches out tosell more stock by year end when tougher capital guidelinestake effect.   Mr. Ruding's expected appointment will raise the number ofCiticorp's inner circle of top executives to five. Itcoincides with a shake-up in oversight of the 23,000-memberwork force in world-wide corporate financial services, nowdivided between Alan MacDonald, 48, and Mr. Callen. Four ofthe nine divisions reporting to Mr. Callen are seen reportingto Mr. Braddock. Others are expected to report to Mr. Rudingor the other vice chairmen, William Rhodes and Paul Collins.   Mr. MacDonald, who has been in charge of developingcountry corporate finance, is expected to take overresponsibilty for North America corporate lending. ErnstBrutsche, who oversees Europe under Mr. Callen, is likely toremain in that slot with more autonomy, said another Citicorpexecutive close to the reorganization planning.   An international banking expert with a Ph.D. in economics,Mr. Ruding helped slash the Netherlands' budget deficit inthe 1980s, when he was finance minister from 1982 to 1989.During most of that time he also was chairman of the InterimCommittee of the International Monetary Fund, the centralpolicy-making committee of the fund, and he also chaired anumber of other prominent multinational development banks.Earlier he had been a member of the board of managingdirectors of the Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank.   &quot;Onno was highly regarded as the Interim Committeechairman and is on a personal speaking basis with everyoneimportant in the financial community, including theJapanese,&quot; said a former IMF official who worked with Mr.Ruding at the IMF. Mr. Ruding currently is chairman of theNetherlands Christian Federation of Employers.   The Netherlands Christian Federation of Employers is oneof two large organizations representing business interests inthe Netherlands. It lobbies, holds conferences and makesstudies. As its chairman, Mr. Ruding has prodded thegovernment to reduce its huge debt and budget deficit faster,partly by reducing the country's generous payments todisabled workers.   At Citicorp, bank insiders expect Mr. Ruding to be astrategic planner and policy-maker who will leave theday-to-day responsibilities to others. One official close tothe bank said Mr. Ruding will bring a conservative philosophyto the bank, a sharp contrast to the go-go lending era of the1980s.   &quot;The credit culture is going to become much moreconservative,&quot; this official said. &quot;Onno is a much more staidtraditional academic type of banker. It's likely that JohnReed would be giving him authority to change credit policyand get things into shape. No one really had the authority.&quot;   The former IMF official said Mr. Ruding &quot; has a fairly,hard-nosed approach to finance. He's a tough cookie when itcomes to getting the numbers right.&quot;   From 1985 through mid-1987, Mr. Callen was responsible forcorporate lending in North America. He had reported duringthat time to Lawrence Small who resigned as a vice chairmanlast summer to become chairman of the Federal NationalMortgage Association. Mr. Callen has had the difficult job ofbuilding morale and inspiring loyalty while wielding a sharpax in cutting personnel from 17,000 to 13,000.   Citicorp watchers in the financial community reactedpositively to the prospect of Mr. Ruding's appointment. &quot;Whenyou are struggling like Citicorp is, this could be animportant element in restoring credibility,&quot; said JamesMcDermott, president of Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods, a bankresearch and investment banking firm.   ---   Steven Lipin contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
