Rundle (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> CAL </CO><TEXT>   Two women employees of the downtown San Diego branch of California Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association chased and apprehended a man who absconded with $1,154 of the thrift's funds.    Carla Harper, the branch's 35-year-old manager, said she had just returned from lunch Wednesday when a teller rushed up and said that a man who appeared to have a gun had taken the cash. The thrift is a unit of CalFed Inc. in Los Angeles.    Ms. Harper, and another employee who was with her at the time, both dressed in business suits and high-heels, immediately set out after the man. About 1 1/2 blocks down the street, just as the suspect was about to flee in a cab, Ms. Harper yelled out &quot;that man just robbed a bank.&quot; The man jumped out of the car and started running again.    Ms. Harper stopped to pick up a cigarette pack the man dropped, thinking it might have his fingerprints, while her companion continued the chase. In hot pursuit, she followed him into a Greyhound Bus depot, but lost him. She returned to the branch to give a report to authorities.    A few minutes later the employee, Julie Beckman, decided the suspect must be hiding in a bus at the Greyhound bus parking lot. The 25-year-old Ms. Beckman returned to look for him, and something from inside one of the bus bathrooms caught her eye. She pushed in the door and found the man sitting inside on the toilet. She grabbed hold of his shirt, led him off the bus, and handed him over to a security officer inside the bus station.    The suspect, a 37-year-old convicted bank robber, was later arrested by local police.    &quot;We don't know what possessed us,&quot; Ms. Harper said in an interview. &quot;Our original intention was just to see where he went, and then adrenalin took over.&quot;    Ms. Harper said the reaction from her employer, the nation's fourth largest thrift, has been &quot;terrific.&quot; &quot;Of course, they're all very proud of us,&quot; she said.    But Ms. Harper says she wouldn't do it again. &quot;You're only a hero once,&quot; she said, and besides, what the two women did &quot;is against bank policy.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
