Pizza Inn Acquiring Corp., a company formed by the restaurant chain's chairman, F.J. Spillman, said the agreement with the venture capital firm, which it declined to identify, calls for the firm to use its &quot;best efforts&quot; to complete a $20 million subordinated debenture issue that would finance part of the buyout. Previously, the investor group obtained an $18 million financing agreement from Lloyds Bank PLC, London.    In a leveraged buyout, investors finance an acquisition largely with debt. The debt is then paid either from the acquired company's operations or by selling assets.    The investor group said the agreement with the venture capital company is subject to several conditions, including definitive financing documents. However, Pizza Inn Acquiring said it believes that the agreement with the venture capital firm will allow the buyout transaction to be completed by the Feb. 28 termination date of the buyout proposal.    As previously reported, Pizza Inn shareholders approved the buyout plan under which holders would receive $12.50 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
