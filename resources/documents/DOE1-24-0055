Theresults obtained are as follows: (1) Control response of wind power turbine;As for variable pitch control and yaw control in association with variationof wind speed and direction, the frequency of stoppage due to over speedingof the wind was reduced to almost nil and other proper control becamefeasible. (2) Strength of wind turbine; By raising the set value of cutout against high wind speed up to 22 m/s, the wind turbine was confirmedto be usable against high wind speed. (3) Characteristics of power generatingoutput; As for the characteristics of wind speed and power generationoutput, the experimental value was 205 higher than the theoretical value.The data concerning the relationship between operating time and the quantityof generated power were also obtained. (4) Effects to distribution system;As for the effects on voltage variation, no problem was confirmed. Asfor the effects on frequency variation, troubles were resolved by modifyingthe control system. (5) Reliability of equipments; The necessity wasconfirmed for taking into due consideration the climatic changes anddamages from sea wind in designing equipment and maintenance data wereobtained.
