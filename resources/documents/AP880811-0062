At least 90 Vietnamese who fled to this British colony by boathave volunteered to return home, including about 70 who made therequest after last week's talks, according to the spokeswoman, whodemanded anonymity.   Only 21 boat people have been voluntarily repatriated from HongKong since 1978, including two in July.   Hong Kong and Vietnam officials met in Hanoi to discussrepatriating boat people viewed by the British colony not aspolitical refugees but as illegal immigrants fleeing a batteredeconomy.   No agreement was reached but further talks are expected.   Vietnam has said it would repatriate boat people who want toreturn home, while Hong Kong is seeking to send back mostVietnamese who arrived after mid-June.   After the Vietnam War ended in 1975, Hong Kong considered allVietnamese arriving by boat to be political refugees eligible forresettlement in third countries.   But under a new policy which took effect June 16 to curb thesurging number of arrivals, all incoming Vietnamese are consideredillegal immigrants subject to repatriation unless they can provethey fled communist Vietnam because of persecution.   The spokeswoman said some of the 90 volunteers were classifiedas illegal immigrants while others were classified as refugeesentitled to be resettled overseas. She said she had no furtherdetails.   The repatriation applications will be forwarded to the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees to discuss with Hanoi.   About 7,000 Vietnamese have sailed into Hong Kong since the newpolicy took effect, bringing the number of boat people in thecolony to about 23,000.   United Nations officials could not be reached for immediatecomment.</TEXT></DOC>
