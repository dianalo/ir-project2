The move had been expected, but came after Iraq's new oilminister, Osama A.R. Al-Hiti, almost derailed thediscussions.</LP><TEXT>   First, arguing a procedural point, Mr. Al-Hiti succeededin holding up for a few hours the reappointment of OPEC'sSecretary-General, Subroto. Secondly, he pressed the othersto intercede on Iraq's behalf against the United Nationssanctions that ban exports of Iraqi oil.   Nevertheless, Mr. Subroto was confirmed for another termand the other oil ministers declined to follow up on Iraq'sproposal regarding the U.N. sanctions. Asked by reporters ifhe was satisfied with the outcome of the meeting, the Iraqiminister replied: &quot;Yes, of course.&quot;   Despite the delays during the day, OPEC's midyearconference moved to a speedy conclusion. It ended last nightafter only one day of talks by the oil ministers.   In addition to extending the production ceiling at thecurrent level for another three months, the oil ministerselected as their president Celestino Armas of Venezuela,succeeding Sadek Boussena of Algeria, and named Jabril Aminuof Nigeria alternate president.   In an interview, Mr. Aminu said he was pleased with theextension of the production ceiling, which he noted will beslightly lower than the 22.5 million of the 1990 thirdquarter. &quot;I believe that demand will be higher in the thirdquarter&quot; than the level of production set by the oilministers, he said.   The oil market's response to the OPEC decision waslukewarm, but several oil ministers suggested the averageprice of the OPEC basket of seven crudes, now $17.68 abarrel, should firm. &quot;The average will be around $19 in thethird quarter and around $20 when we enter the fourthquarter,&quot; Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oil minister,said in an interview.   However, some oil ministers weren't pleased. They wantedoutput to be reduced in the third quarter to push up theprice of OPEC oil faster toward their minimum referencetarget of $21 a barrel. Mr. Boussena, for example, opened theconference by noting that the OPEC basket was nearly $4 shortof the minimum reference price. As a result, he said, &quot;OPECas a whole has suffered a loss in potential earnings ofnearly $7 billion.&quot;   Some others, including the oil ministers of Saudi Arabiaand the United Arab Emirates, sought higher productionbecause of the increase in demand for OPEC oil expected inthe remainder of the year.   But the majority of the 13 nations seemed content to &quot;rollover&quot; the ceiling at the current level. Still, according toMr. Subroto, the ceiling was a &quot;hotly debated issue.&quot;   The oil ministers agreed there is a possibility of aresumption in oil exports by Iraq and Kuwait in the third orfourth quarter. As a result, they said they would meet againin September to &quot;determine the appropriate production ceilingfor the fourth quarter.&quot;   While the ministers rejected Iraq's bid for them tointercede on its behalf in the U.N., they appealed to therest of the world &quot;to support Kuwait in its fight againstenvironmental pollution caused by burning wells.&quot;   ---   Allanna Sullivan contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
