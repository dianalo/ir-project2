But some fear the newcomers will only add more uncertainty to analready volatile industry. Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and China areamong the latest owners of U.S. oil refining assets.   All are major oil producers; two are members of OPEC with thepotential to exert power over the American oilpatch.   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been blamedfor the recent glut of oil on world markets and the resulting dropin oil prices that has hurt U.S. exploration and production.   But industry experts attending the annual meeting here of theAmerican Petroleum Institute this past week said U.S. refinerswelcome their newest partners in business.   ``The idea of foreign investment is a positive one. It's moneycoming into the U.S. to buy an existing plant like any other plant.I don't see any problem with it,'' says John H. Lichtblau, presidentof the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.   Jim Bailey, spokesman for the Coastal Corp., an independentrefiner that last month signed a joint venture deal with China, saysinvestment by producing countries will ``help smooth out extremelyvolatile price and supply swings and assures us of a long-termrelationship with a crude oil supplier.''   But others fear foreign producer ownership of U.S. assetsjeopardizes national security and further reduces incentives toimprove domestic production.   ``Just like everything else, we're selling our assets abroad(under the guise that) supposedly it will be helping shareholders,''said James L. Van Alen, an analyst with Janney Montgomery.   Most of the nation's major oil companies recently reported hugeprofits in their refining operations, thanks to surging consumerdemand and low crude prices. But in a highly cyclical business,conditions could shift.   Economist Cyrus H. Tahmassebi, market research director forAshland Oil Inc., believes joint ventures with producing countrieswill provide U.S. companies with sound business partners ``willingto take part of the risk in a cyclical business.''   But Tahmassebi acknowledges there are concerns.   ``One can argue ... that joint venture arrangements might lead tolower oil prices, reduced domestic production and increasedimports,'' he said. ``In this indirect manner, such arrangements mayhave national security implications.''   Texaco Inc.'s recent pact with Saudi Arabia touched off thelatest concern about foreign ownership of U.S. oil assets.   Under the joint venture, the Saudis will pay Texaco some $812million in exchange for half-ownership of Texaco refining assets in23 eastern and Gulf Coast states and Washington D.C. The Saudis willsupply 75 percent of the initial oil inventory and each partner willprovide 50 percent of the working capital, according to Texaco.   Analysts agree that Texaco invited the Saudis in because itneeded cash. Texaco expects $1.8 billion in cash benefits andsavings from the venture to pay the debt stemming from its $3billion settlement with Pennzoil Co., the company said.   But there were other reasons as well.   Tahmassebi says the Saudi deal ensures Texaco secure access toSaudi crude at competitive prices. Under the deal, Texaco said ithas the right to buy up to 600,000 barrels a day at market prices.   A citizens group opposed the deal and called on the government tohalt the sale until the new administration could determine if it isin the country's best interest.   But analysts said the Reagan Administration welcomed it as asource of greater supply security.   Lichtblau believes much of the criticism is groundless. Argumentsabout foreign producer partners disrupting supplies, as OPEC has inthe past, don't make sense, he says.   ``They wouldn't supply their own refinery? They would hardlytarget their own refinery.''   Analysts also say oil imported under the deals is not displacingdomestic oil and in fact the new influx of funds may go towardfurther exploration and production by U.S. companies.   Joint ventures are not new. Britain and Holland have been in theUnited States for decades through British Petroleum Co. and RoyalDutch Shell.   ``The new trend is the OPEC countries coming here _ and China,''Lichtblau said.   Since the 1986 price collapse, Tahmassebi says ``practicallyevery OPEC country has seriously considered the idea of buyingoverseas refineries or embarking on some kind of a joint venturearrangement.''   Venezuela is said to be the biggest investor in refineries inconsuming countries. It now owns some 240,000 barrels per day ofU.S. refining capacity, including its recent purchase of a 50percent interest in Citgo Petroleum Corp.   Coastal's deal with China involves a 55,000 barrel per dayrefinery in Hercules, Calif., as well as storage facilities inCalifornia and Oregon.   Lichtblau estimates that OPEC countries and China together nowown 7 percent of the nation's 13 million barrel per day refiningcapacity.   Industry sources believe U.S. refining is ripe for furtherinvestment.   Sun Oil Co. is seriously negotiating with Nigeria, analysts say,and Ashland Oil Chairman John Hall acknowledges that his companyalso is looking for the ``right'' deal with a foreign investor.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
