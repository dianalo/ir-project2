Background </ITAG>Pursuant to Public Law (P.L.) 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(the Commission) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. P.L. 97-415revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act),to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, orproposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act.This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediatelyeffective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination bythe Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration,notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearingfrom any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposedto be issued from May 6, 1989 through May 19, 1989. The last biweekly noticewas published on May 17, 1989 (54 FR 21297). <ITAG tagnum="84">NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATINGLICENSE AND PROPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION DETERMINATIONAND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING </ITAG>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendmentrequests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for eachamendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration and Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page numberof this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-216, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Marylandfrom 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions forleave to intervene is discussed below. By June 30, 1989 the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respectto issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating licenseand any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and whowishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a writtenpetition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitions forleave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rulesof Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If arequest for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by theabove date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designatedby the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and the Secretaryor the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a noticeof hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Anyhearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received before action is taken. Should theCommission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance and providefor opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects thatthe need to take this action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitionsare filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">Carolina Power andamp; Light Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50-325 and50-324, Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, Brunswick County,North Carolina </ITAG><T3>Date of application for amendments: </T3>June 22, 1988 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The amendments would deletethe residual heat removal (RHR)/service water discharge differential pressureinstrument (transmitter and indicator) from the Technical Specifications(TS) for each unit. The licensee states that operability is not requiredto ensure the RHR and service water systems function as designed. The subjectindication is located on the remote shutdown panel for each unit. Thispanel is utilized to shut down the unit and maintain shutdown conditionsin the event control room habitability is lost. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazard consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a nosignificant hazard consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Aproposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The Carolina Power andamp; Light Company (CPandamp;L) has reviewed the proposedchanges to the TS and has determined that the requested amendment doesnot involve a significant hazards consideration for the following reasons:<ITAG tagnum="21">1. The design, function, and operation of the plant systems will remainunchanged. Item 9, ``Residual Heat Removal Service Water Discharge DifferentialPressure,'' and instruments E11-PDT-N002BX and E11-PDI-3344 are being deletedfrom Tables 3.3.5.2-1 and 4.3.5.2-1 because they are not required to ensurethat the RHR and service water systems function as designed. The RHR heatexchanger differential pressure is not an indicator of heat exchanger performance;therefore, it does nothing to ensure that sufficient capability is availableto permit shutdown and maintenance of hot shutdown from locations outsidethe control room. Thus, these instruments should not be considered remoteshutdown monitoring instruments and should be deleted from Tables 3.3.5.2-1and 4.3.5.2-1. Since they are not remote shutdown monitoring instruments,their deletion from Table 3.3.5.2-1 and 4.3.5.2-1 will not increase theprobability of an accident, nor will it change the consequences of an accidentpreviously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Instruments E11-PDT-N002BX and E11-PDI-3344 provide relative systempressure only and are not relied upon for remote shutdown. Thus, theseinstruments need not be considered remote shutdown monitoring instrumentsand should be removed from Tables 3.3.5.2-1 and 4.3.5.2-1. Their deletionwill not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentbecause they were not relied upon under accident conditions for remoteshutdown purposes and they will continue to perform their design functionin the same manner as before. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The capability to permit shutdown and maintain hot shutdown ofthe facility from outside the control room is not compromised by deletingInstruments E11-PDT-N002BX and E11-PDI-3344 from Tables 3.3.5.2-1 and 4.3.4.2-1.These instruments currently do not perform a remote shutdown monitoringfunction; they only provide a relative system differential pressure whichis not relied upon in the BSEP remote shutdown procedures to achieve remoteshutdown. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not involve a significantreduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the CPandamp;L determinations and is in basic agreementwith them. RHR/Service Water differential pressure indication on the remoteshutdown panel is not required to shut the plant down or keep it shut down;and this indication is not utilized in the procedure entitled ``Plant Shutdownfrom Outside Control Room.'' Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determinethat these changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>University of North Carolinaat Wilmington, William Madison Randall Library, 601 S.

Adensam <ITAG tagnum="84">Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company, Docket No. 50-213, HaddamNeck Plant, Middlesex County, Connecticut </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>April 14, 1989 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment provideschanges to Technical Specification Sections 3.17.1, ``Axial Offset'' and3.17.2, ``Linear Heat Generation Rate'' to support coastdown operationof the Haddam Neck Plant at the end of Cycle 15. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exist as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. The licensee hasevaluated the proposed amendment against the standards provided in 50.92and determined that the proposed amendment will not: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Operation during coastdown is beyond the scope of the current designbasis LOCA analysis for the Haddam Neck Plant. The current design basisassumes operation consistent with the Tave program. Coastdown operationimmediately following end of core life maintains 100% thermal power byreducing Tave, while fully opening the turbine control valves. Post LOCAanalysis sensitivities have shown that a reduction in the core inlet temperature,while maintaining full power, yields an increase in the projected peakcladding temperature (PCT) for the large break LOCA. This increase in PCTis due to the reduction in reverse core flow during blowdown after thecoastdown of the reactor coolant pumps. The reduced flow yields highertemperatures at the end of blowdown, which yields a higher PCT after theadiabatic heatup and beginning of core recovery. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These sensitivities have also shown that between 100 and 90% power,the sensitivity to the core inlet temperature becomes insignificant relativeto the drop in power. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In order to bound operation during coastdown, the current limitingcase (double ended, cold leg guillotine, C<T2>D</T2> = 1.0) was re-analyzed at full power, but with a bounding coastdowncore inlet temperature at 90% power (Tinlet = 510anddegrees; F). This re-analysisshows that the limiting LHGR must be reduced from the normal end of cyclevalue of 14.6 kw/ft to 13.5 kw/ft to maintain the PCT less than the InterimAcceptance Criteria limit of 2300anddegrees; F. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The axial offset (AO) limits were developed for the new LHGR limitduring coastdown. The new AO limits are slightly more restrictive on thenegative side. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes ensure that there is no increase or change inthe probability of occurrence of any design basis accidents. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes to the technical specifications ensure that theplant response to an accident during coastdown operation is essentiallywithin the design basis of the plant. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The large break LOCA response during coastdown has been changed, butthe PCT as a function of time after break retains the key characteristicsassociated with blowdown, refill and reflood. The reduction in the LHGRensures that the PCT remains less than 2300anddegrees; F for a postulateddesign basis event during coastdown conditions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There are no new failure modes associated with the proposed technicalspecification changes. Therefore, the changes do not present the possibilityfor a new, unanalyzed accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes to the technical specifications ensure that themargins of safety have not been reduced significantly. The reduction inthe allowable LHGR from 14.6 to 13.5 kw/ft during coastdown operation afterthe end of core life restores the PCT to less than 2300anddegrees; F. Thenew AO limits provide alarm points to assure that operation above an LHGRof 13.5 kw/ft is prohibited. Since the PCT remains less than 2300anddegrees;F, there is no impact on the protective boundaries. </ITAG>The NRC staff has reviewed this analysis and based on this review, it appearsthat the three criteria are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposesto determine that the application for amendment involves no significanthazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Russel Library, 123 BroadStreet, Middletown, Connecticut 06457. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Gerald Garfield, Esquire, Day, Berry andamp;Howard, Counselors at Law, City Place, Hartford, Connecticut 06103-3499.<T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>John F.

This new section will followthe Westinghouse Standard format Technical Specifications. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards in 10 CFR 50.92(c) for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists.

Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. The determination of whether or nota proposed change is equivalent, more restrictive (or a new requirement)or less restrictive is based on the Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO)and Applicability Requirements since it is these requirements which willimpact the design basis accidents. In general, the conversion to the WSTS yields more extensive and/or restrictive Action or Surveillance Requirements.As described above, most of the changes are more restrictive in that thereare no comparable requirements in the existing Technical Specifications,and the proposed changes are equivalent to the W STS. For the few changesthat are less restrictive, justification is provided for the changes. Sincethe proposed Sections 3.6.1 through 3.6.4 do not reduce the availabilityor the reliability of the ECCS, the consequences of the design basis accidentsremain unchanged. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2.

Because there are no hardware modifications associatedwith the proposed changes, the performance of safety related systems remainsunaffected during operations.

Therefore, the proposed Technical Specifications will not modifythe plant response to the point where it can be considered a new accidentnor are any credible failure modes created. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Becausethe changes proposed herein provide acceptable results for the design basisaccident, no additional burden will be placed on the protective boundariesfor postulated accidents.

The Commission concludes that: A. The changes do not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated (10 CFR 50.92(c)(1))because the changes are organizational and administrative in nature. Theproposed changes merely affect the manner by which the safety review functionis conducted. The proposed changes are intended to strengthen this function.B.

The proposed change reflects a design change, when approved by thestaff, which will eliminate use of the RTD bypass system. To support this request, the licensee submitted Westinghouse topical reportWCAP-12058, ``RTD Bypass Elimination Licensing Report for Beaver ValleyUnit 1'' which describes the extensive analyses, evaluation and testingperformed to ensure the new design meets all safety and regulatory requirements.The changes to the Technical Specifications would reflect the characteristics(e.g., response time) of the fast-response RTDs. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists in accordance with 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposedamendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significanthazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with theproposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) createthe possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accidentpreviously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety. The RTDs are not assumed to be precursors of accidents. However, theirtimely response has direct impacts on the consequences of accidents analyzedin the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). The licensee stated that thenew RTDs will have the same total response times as the existing RTDs withtheir associated manifold bypass system. Since total response times arenot changed, and RTDs are not regarded as accident precursors, the answerto the first question is negative. The proposed change would involve elimination of the bypass system, whichis part of the reactor coolant boundary. This change will be performedin a manner consistent with the applicable standards, will preserve theexisting design bases, and will not adversely affect the qualificationof any other plant systems. The new RTDs are of a proven design currentlyused at other plants (e.g., Salem, Robinson). Therefore, no new accidentscan be attributed to the new RTDs. Finally, there is no change in design basis. The new design is expectedto provide the same overall reliability, redundancy and diversity as theexisting design. No accident assumptions will be relaxed or modified. Hencethe answer to the last question is also negative. The staff therefore proposes to determine that the requested amendmentinvolves no significant hazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>B. F.

Theproposed change would revise TS 4.6.F.2 such that the sampling would berequired only once every 24 hours when the reactor coolant temperatureis less than or equal to 212anddegrees; F. When coolant temperature is greaterthan 212anddegrees; F, the sampling frequency would remain at once every4 hours. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <T3>Basis for Proposed Change:</T3> High conductivity of the reactor coolant may indicate the presence of chloridesin the coolant which can lead to stress corrosion cracking of the stainlesssteel components in contact with the coolant. The corrosion rate is temperaturedependent. Normally, reactor coolant conductivity is monitored continuouslyby a conductivity monitor. During periods when the conductivity monitoris out of service, conductivity is measured by taking periodic samplesof the reactor coolant. Since the corrosion rate is temperature dependent,the Standard Technical Specifications (STS) for boiling water reactorsas well as the TS for Hatch Unit 2 recognize this fact by allowing a reducedsampling frequency of once every 24 hours when the coolant temperatureis less than or equal to 212anddegrees; F. At higher coolant temperatures,both the STS and the Hatch 2 TS require coolant conductivity sampling at4-hour intervals at times when the continuous conductivity monitor is outof service. This proposed change would make the sampling requirements forHatch Unit 1 equivalent to the requirements for Hatch Unit 2 and consistentwith the requirements of the STS.

A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.In regard to the proposed amendment, the licensee has determined the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">1. It has been determined that both system and component performancewill not be adversely affected by the increase in flow. Therefore, theprobability of previously analyzed accidents has not been increased. Additionally,since no new failure mode or new limiting single failure has been identified,the possibility of a different accident being created does not exist andthe probability of a malfunction of safety related equipment has not beenincreased. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The increased CCP flow has been determined to have no impact or aninsignificant effect on the safety analysis results. Therefore, the consequencesof an accident previously evaluated in the FSAR [have] not been increasedand the consequences of a malfunction of equipment [have] not become moresevere. Therefore, the increase in the CCP flow from 550 gpm to 555 gpmdoes not result in any increase in radioactive releases as a result ofnormal operation or as a result of evaluated accidents. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As indicated in the above evaluations, the acceptance criteria foreach of the safety analyses has not been exceeded. Therefore, there isno reduction in the margin of safety between the safety analysis assumptionsand the Technical Specification values as defined in the basis to the TechnicalSpecification. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The increase in flow will not affect the postulated causes of previouslyevaluated accidents. The minimum required flow has not changed, thereforethe accidents evaluated with minimum flow assumptions are not affectedby this change. The increase in maximum flow has been demonstrated, asdiscussed above, to be well below the maximum values assumed in the accidentanalyses. The potential increase in flow has been shown to have negligible[e]ffect on pump and motor reliability. Therefore, this revision to themaximum allowable pump flow with a single pump running from 550 gpm to555 gpm for Unit 1 will not involve a significant increase in the probability[or] consequences of accidents previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. This change in allowable maximum flow rate does not involve anyphysical change in the plant. Should future flow adjustments allow thepump to flow at 555 gpm, it will continue to operate within its designedcapability and within the safety analyses assumptions. Therefore, thisrevision to the Technical Specification does not create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. As discussed above, the minimum flow requirements of TechnicalSpecifications have not changed. Evaluations have been performed whichconclude that the maximum flow assumption used in those analyses continueto envelope the allowable value in the revised Technical Specification.Therefore, the margin between the results of the analyses and the safetylimit have not changed, and this revision to the Technical Specificationdoes not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG>The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's determination and concurs withits findings.

This change does not involve a designchange or physical change with respect to new or modified equipment, nordoes it involve a change in the mode of operating existing equipment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Thus, no new accident scenario is introduced by this clarificationof requirements for suppression pool operability. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in themargin of safety because this clarification of requirements for suppressionpool operability significantly reduces the possibility of not consideringSPPS as part of suppression pool operability, which would enhance safetyrather than reduce the margin of safety. </ITAG>The licensee provided additional analyses in the May 2, 1989 submittal:<ITAG tagnum="21">The revision to the action requirements will not increase the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated or create the possibilityof a new or different event because the system design and operation remainsconsistent with that provided in the Safety Analysis Report, therefore,plant response remains as originally evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The relief from the provisions of Specification 3.0.4 will not reducethe level of safety because one system is still required and the operabilityof the ECCS equipment is not effected by leakage in the crescent area.Because of the watertight ECCS cubicals, this evaluation has shown withone SPPS subsystem operable the plant response to a single failure willnot result in a primary success path, as analyzed in the safety analysisreport, being inhibited. The request to allow startup and changes in theoperational condition with one subsystem operable also supports the basisof the Technical Specification. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The change will not reduce any identified margin of safety becausethe functional testing will increase the plant staff awareness of the systemsability to perform as described in the Safety Analysis Report. Becausethe pumps are used during normal plant operation, the knowledge of theloss of the remaining operable subsystem will be readily available. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In conclusion, the proposed operating change will not increase thepossibility or the consequences of a previously evaluated event and willnot create a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.Also, the results of this request are within all acceptable criteria willrespect to system components and design requirements. The ability to performas described in the updated safety analysis report (USAR) is maintainedand therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reductionin the margin of safety. Therefore, GSU proposes that no significant hazardsare involved. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination. Based on the review and the above discussions, the staffproposes to determine that the proposed changes do not involve a significanthazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Government Documents Department,Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Troy B.

The proposed Technical Specification changes represent revisionsto Section 4.2.7, Reactor Coolant System Isolation Valves, Table 4.6.2a,Instrumentation that Initiates Scram, and the Notes for Tables 3.6.2a and4.6.2a. Specifically, Surveillance Requirement 4.2.7.c is being proposed for revisionto change the frequency of testing the feedwater and main steam line power-operatedisolation valves from at least twice per week to at least once per quarter.The proposed once-per-quarter test frequency would reduce wear that isdetrimental to seat tightness, and is in accordance with ASME Boiler andPressure Vessel Code, Section XI, 1983 Edition with Summer 1983 Addendum,which is the edition of the ASME Code endorsed by 10 CFR 50.55a(g). In addition, Surveillance Requirement 4.2.7.d would be added to incorporatethe full closure test for the feedwater and main steam line isolation valvesconsistent with the requirements of ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel CodeSection XI, 1983 Edition with Summer 1983 Addendum. This test would beperformed during each plant cold shutdown unless it has been performedin the previous three months (92 days). The existing Surveillance Requirement 4.2.7.d would be renumbered to 4.2.7.e,a purely administrative revision. The revision to Table 4.6.2a changes the frequency of the main steam lineisolation valve position instrument channel test from once per three monthsto once per cold shutdown. This change is in accordance with recommendationsprovided by the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. In its safety evaluationthat accompanied a May 8, 1984 Memorandum for R. Starostecki from D. Eisenhut,Subject: Nine Mile Point 1 - Evaluation of Technical Specification Requirementsfor Main Steam Isolation Valve Limit Switch Testing, the Office of NuclearReactor Regulation recommended that the instrument channel test for thesevalves be conducted ``prior to startup following plant shutdowns by actualclosure of the main steam isolation valve(s), unless the test has beenperformed within the previous 92 days.'' The revisions to Table 4.6.2aincorporate this recommendation. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards (10 CFR 50.92(c)) for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee has provided the following analysis: <ITAG tagnum="21">1) The revision to the test frequency of the feedwater valves andthe main steam line isolation valves meets appropriate industry standards.The test frequencies are in accordance with ASME Boiler and Pressure VesselCode Section XI, 1983 Edition with Summer 1983 Addendum. This edition hasbeen approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as indicated in 10 CFR50.55a. Furthermore, the change in test frequency is consistent with thelicensee's proposed Inservice Testing Program. The change in test frequencycontinues to provide the necessary number of tests to provide an indicationof reliability while preventing unnecessary wear to the affected equipment.Therefore, no significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated will occur. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The change in frequency for performing the main steam isolation valvelimit switch testing is consistent with the above-cited safety evaluationperformed by the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. That evaluationindicates that the probability of the protection system failing to initiatethe actuation of the equipment is and can be maintained acceptably lowwithout testing the equipment during reactor operation. This change isrequested to require performing the instrument channel test in the coldshutdown condition only. This test should be performed during plant shutdownin order to prevent an inadvertent reactor scram. As indicated in the above-citedsafety evaluation, the function of the main steam isolation valve limitswitches is to initiate a scram to terminate a main steam isolation valveclosure transient. However, if the limit switches should fail, two otherindependent and diverse scram functions (reactor high pressure and highneutron flux) are available to terminate the transient, as noted in theNine Mile Point Unit 1 FSAR Section XV.3.5, Main Steam Isolation ValveClosure with Scram. Therefore, the proposed change to the main steam lineisolation valve limit switch testing will not significantly increase theprobability or consequences of a main steam line accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2) The proposed change regarding the exercising of the main steamand feedwater isolation valves maintains the same type of testing practicedin the past; only the frequency has changed. The change affecting the testingof the main steam isolation valve limit switches is to require testingto be performed only during cold shutdown. Since there is no change inplant configuration to perform the tests, the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated will not be introduced.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3) The change in test frequency continues to provide an accurate indicationof reliability while preventing unnecessary wear on equipment. Therefore,a significant reduction in a margin of safety will not occur. </ITAG>Based on the above, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed changesdo not involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Reference and Documents Department,Penfield Library, State University of New York, Oswego, New York 13126.<T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Troy B.

The proposed amendment incorporates the recommendations of NUREG-0313Revision 2, ``Technical Report on Material Selection and Process Guidelinesfor BWR Coolant Pressure Boundary Piping,'' as promulgated by Generic Letter88-01. Niagara Mohawk has been complying with the requirements of NUREG-0313Revision 1 since 1979.

Inaddition, the Core Operating Limits Report has been included in the DefinitionsSection of the Technical Specifications (TS) to note that it is the unit-specificdocument that provides these limits for the current operating reload cycle.Furthermore, the definition notes that the values of these cycle-specificparameter limits are to be determined in accordance with the Specification6.9.1f. This Specification requires that the Core Operating Limits be determinedfor each reload cycle in accordance with the referenced NRC-approved methodologyfor these limits and consistent with the applicable limits of the safetyanalysis. Finally, this report and any mid-cycle revisions shall be providedto the NRC upon issuance. Generic Letter 88-16, dated October 4, 1988,from the NRC provided guidance to licensees on requests for removal ofthe values of cycle-specific parameter limits from TS. The licensee's proposedamendment is in response to this Generic Letter. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The staff has evaluated this proposed amendment and determined thatit involves no significant hazards considerations. According to 10 CFR50.92(c), a proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significanthazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance withthe proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase inthe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or(2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The proposed revision to the License Condition is in accordance with theguidance provided in Generic Letter 88-16 for licensees requesting removalof the values of cycle-specific parameter limits from TS. The establishmentof these limits in accordance with an NRC-approved methodology and theincorporation of these limits into the Core Operating Limits Report willensure that proper steps have been taken to establish the values of theselimits. Furthermore, the submittal of the Core Operating Limits Reportwill allow the staff to continue to trend the values of these limits withoutthe need for prior staff approval of these limits and without introductionof an unreviewed safety question. The revised specifications with the removalof the values of cycle-specific parameter limits and that addition of thereferenced report for these limits does not create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident for those previously evaluated. Theyalso do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety sincethe change does not alter the methods used to establish these limits. Consequently,the proposed change on the removal of the values of cycle-specific limitsdoes not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. Because the values of cycle-specific parameter limits will continue tobe determined in accordance with an NRC-approved methodology and consistentwith the applicable limits of the safety analysis, these changes are administrativein nature and do not impact the operation of the facility in a manner thatinvolves significant hazards consideration. The proposed amendment does not alter the requirement that the plant beoperated within the limits for cycle-specific parameters nor the requiredremedial actions that must be taken when these limits are not met. Whileit is recognized that such requirements are essential to plant safety,the values of limits can be determined in accordance with NRC-approvedmethods without affecting nuclear safety. With the removal of the valuesof these limits from the Technical Specifications, they have been incorporatedinto the Core Operating Limits Report that is submitted to the Commission.Hence, appropriate measures exist to control the values of these limits.These changes are administrative in nature and do not impact the operationof the facility in a manner that involves significant hazards considerations.Based on the preceding assessment, the staff believes this proposed amendmentinvolves no significant hazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Reference and Documents Department,Penfield Library, State University of New York, Oswego, New York 13126.<T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Troy B.

Whilepreparing to perform the ILRT during the Cycle 2/Cycle 3 refueling outage,the licensee identified two areas where incompatibility exists betweenthe requirements to perform the ILRT and other TS requirements to maintaincertain components and systems operable during the ILRT. The followingareas of inconsistency were identified by the licensee: 1. Radiation Monitoring - TS Table 3.3-6, Item 1a, requires that the containmentarea purge and exhaust isolation radiation detectors be maintained operable(in all modes). If the subject monitors become inoperable, the containmentexhaust and purge valves must be maintained in the closed position perAction Statement 26. The licensee has proposed that Action Statement 26 be revised to removethe requirements that the containment purge and exhaust isolation arearadiation monitors (RE41 and RE42) be operable during the Type A containmentILRT. During a Type A containment ILRT, the Millstone Unit No. 3 containmentis pressurized to the calculated design basis accident containment pressureof 54.1 psia to verify containment leak tightness. The pressurization pathis through the purge air supply piping, Containment Penetration Z86. Thecontainment purge and exhaust system is interlocked with radiation monitoringinstrumentation located inside containment. Since the radiation monitoringinstrumentation is not designed to withstand a pressure of 54.1 psia, theywill be removed from containment for the duration of the ILRT. Per TechnicalSpecification 3.3.3.1, which references TS Table 3.3-6, the purge and exhaustvalves must be isolated with less than minimum radiation monitoring instrumentationchannels available. However, opening the purge air supply valve is requiredto conduct the ILRT and satisfy 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J. Therefore,a revision to Action Statement 26 has been proposed to removed the requirementthat the RE41 and RE42 radiation monitors be operable during the containmentILRT. 2. Fire Protection - TS 3.7.12.2, Item K and TS Table 3.7-4 requires thecontainment cable penetration area sprinkler system and the containmentfire hose stations, to be operable, respectively. The licensee has indicatedthat the containment fire protection water system that enters containmentat Penetration Z56 must be drained and vented to meet the provisions ofthe Millstone Unit No. 3 Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) Section 6.2.6and the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J for performance of theILRT. Accordingly, the licensee has proposed that a footnote be added to TechnicalSpecification Section 3.7.12.2 and TS Table 3.7-4 which exempts the containmentcable penetration area sprinkler system and containment fire hose stationsfrom operability requirements during Type A containment ILRT. To partiallymitigate the proposed inoperability of the containment fire suppressionsystems, the licensee has proposed a footnote to Table 3.3-11 to includea requirement that fire detection instruments in the electrical penetrationarea, Elevation 24andmin16;6andmin16;andmin16;, be operable during the performanceof Type A containment ILRT. All other fire detection instruments locatedwithin the containment area would not be required to be operable duringthe performance of a Type A containment ILRT. At the present time, TS Table3.3-11 does not require the operability of any fire protection instrumentation,inside containment, during the ILRT. Title 10, CFR 50.92, ``Issuance of Amendment,'' contains standards foraddressing the existence of no significant hazards considerations withregard to issuance of license amendments. The licensee has addressed thestandards of 10 CFR 50.92, with regard to the proposed changes to the TSassociated with the May 9, 1989 application, as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards considerationbecause the changes would not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously analyzed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Type A ILRT is performed in Mode 5 with no personnel in containment.There are no design basis accidents which occur in Mode 5 and rely on eithercontainment purge and exhaust radiation monitoring or the inside containmentfire detection/suppression equipment. The only accidents which can occurin Mode 5 and require these functions are a loss of shutdown cooling andan inside containment fire. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Sufficient time exists following a loss of shutdown cooling for theoperator to manually isolate the valves and prevent any releases from containment.Operator action is based on indications of a loss of shutdown cooling event.Thus, the change does not impact the consequences of a loss of shutdowncooling event. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">During depressurization of the containment, grab samples will be obtainedto verify that a radioactivity release is not occurring. Thus, it willlimit the potential radiological consequences of the ILRT to an acceptablelevel. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The fire detection and suppression equipment is credited only in firescenarios. The changes will permit the containment fire water isolationvalves to be closed in order to measure containment leakage, but will requirethe fire detection instrumentation in the electrical penetration area tobe operable. The operating fire detection components ensure that the operatorswill be alerted to a fire inside containment. As stated above, the plantprocedure governing the Type A containment ILRT will require the cancellationof the ILRT and the opening of containment water isolation valves if botha smoke detection alarm is received and if any energized component/systemoperating within the containment trips simultaneously for any unknown reasonduring the test. Action statements within the containment leakage ratetest procedure will allow the plant to take appropriate actions (open fireisolation valves) before any major fire damage occurs. Thus, the changedoes not impact the consequences of a postulated inside containment fire.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The containment purge and exhaust radiation monitoring equipment andcontainment fire detection/suppression system do not have the potentialto initiate any previously analyzed accident. Operator action to isolatethe purge and exhaust system or unisolate the containment fire water system,based on available indication, will negate the impact on the consequencesof having these systems inoperable. For these reasons, the changes to theoperability requirements of these systems do not increase the probabilityor consequence of any previously analyzed accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany previously analyzed. The changes do not alter the way the plant isoperated and only affects the containment ILRT. The change does not introducenew failure modes. For these reasons, the change does not have the potentialto create a new type of accident from that previously analyzed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The changesdo not impact any of the protective boundaries. The plant operators willbe able to either isolate the containment purge and exhaust system or unisolatethe containment fire water system (during the ILRT) based on availableinstrumentation. Thus, these safety functions will not be impacted by thechange. The change does not increase the consequences of any design basisevent. For these reasons, the change does not reduce the margin of safety.</ITAG>The NRC staff has reviewed, and concurs in, the licensee's statement regarding``no significant hazards considerations'' associated with the May 9, 1989application for license amendment.

The licensee in its submittal of March 22, 1989, evaluated the proposedchanges against the significant hazards criteria of 10 CFR 50.92 and againstthe Commission guidance concerning application of this standard. Basedon the evaluation given below, the licensee has concluded that the proposedchanges do not involve a significant hazards consideration. The licensee'sevaluation, as modified by the staff, is as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">a. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Operation of the seismic trip system is not required or assumed tomitigate the consequences of any accident in the FSAR Update safety analyses.The seismic trip system component history demonstrates that component failureswould not have prevented a reactor trip had a seismic event of the prescribedmagnitude occurred. Because the system design does not permit reliabletesting at power, two challenges to the reactor protection system haveoccurred during testing. Such challenges cause an increase in core damagefrequency. Increasing the STI to allow testing to be performed during shutdownperiods will eliminate the risk of inadvertent reactor trips and establishingan out of service time will allow for maintenance or component replacementat power. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the proposed changes to increase the STI of the trip actuatingdevice operational test to 18 months and...[allowing one of three channelsto be bypassed for up to] 72 hours do not increase the probability or consequencesof any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b.

Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Does the change involve a significant reduction in the margin ofsafety? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes would potentially reduce the number of inadvertentreactor trips due to on-line surveillance testing and, therefore, wouldresult in an increase in plant safety. Since the seismic reactor trip isnot assumed to function for any of the Chapter 15 FSAR Update accidentanalyses, there is no affect on the margin of safety as defined in thoseanalyses. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not involve a significantreduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG>The NRC staff has reviewed the proposed changes and the licensee's no significanthazards consideration determination and finds them acceptable.

The proposed BIT removal is consistent with theguidance provided in NRC Generic Letter 85-16, which concluded that thereare inherent safety risks associated with the use of high concentrationsof boron and that improved analysis methods are available to allow BITremoval. Specific TS changes would include: (1) Deletion of TS 3.5.4.1,``Boron Injection Tank'', TS 3.4.4.2, ``Heat Tracing'', and the associatedBases, to allow for bypassing or removing the BIT and associated pipingand components; (2) Revision of TS Table 3.3-5, ``Engineered Safety FeaturesResponse Times'', to make the safety injection response times consistentwith BIT removal; and (3) Revision of TS Table 3.8-1 to change the functionof the BIT inlet and outlet valves to charging injection valves. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a nosignificant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c).A proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment will not: (1) involved a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin or safety.The licensee, in its submittal of May 15, 1989, evaluated the proposedchange against the significant hazards criteria of 10 CFR 50.92 and againstthe Commission guidance concerning application of this standard. Basedon the evaluation given below, the licensee has concluded that the proposedchange does not involve a significant hazards consideration. The licensee'sevaluation is as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">a. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Analysis was performed for an ``Accidental Depressurization of theMain Steam System'' (FSAR Update Section 15.2.13) and ``Major SecondarySteam System Pipe Rupture'' (FSAR Update Section 15.4.2) with the BIT removed.For both cases after the reactor trip, the analysis determined that criticalityis reattained due to plant cooldown, but the DNB design basis is met andno fuel failure will occur. Further analysis was performed to determinethe impact of BIT removal on the containment mass and energy release andcontainment pressure and temperature response. It was shown that the containmentpressure remained below its 47 psig design limit. The containment temperatureresponse increased from the presently reported peak temperature value of339 degrees F to 345 degrees F. PGandamp;E has determined that the componentsinside containment critical to safety are not adversely affected by thissmall increase in temperature. Therefore, analysis results determined thatthe containment pressure transient response for the most limiting caseassured pressure below design and the aggregate temperature response wouldnot affect the current equipment qualification inside containment. Finally,analysis was performed assuming removal of the BIT to determine the massand energy release due to steamline breaks outside containment assumingsuperheated steam release. Analysis results demonstrate that for the worstcase main steamline break outside containment, all safety-related equipmentrequired to mitigate the steamline break accident outside containment andstructural components that would be both subject to the new superheat accidentenvironment and necessary to mitigate the consequences of an accident wouldeither function as designed or would be requalified or replaced. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The results of the safety injection response time evaluation demonstratedthat delivery of borated water to the RCS meets all accident acceptancecriteria. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The results of the above analyses demonstrate that consequences ofpreviously evaluated events are not significantly increased. The resultsof the above analyses further demonstrate an increase in the probabilityof a return to criticality during a Condition II event (depressurizationof the main steam system). However, there is no increase in the probabilityof fuel failure and releases remain within the guideline values of 10 CFR20. Therefore, the equipment inside and outside containment necessary tomitigate the consequences of an accident would function as designed aftermodification and releases during depressurization of the main steam systemremain within the guideline values of 10 CFR 20. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b.

The analysis results demonstrated thatthis equipment will either still respond during accidents or will be requalifiedor replaced. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c.

Therefore, for thedepressurization of the main steam system, release associated with thisaccident will remain within the guideline values set forth in 10 CFR 20and for the major steam line break the radiation releases are within theguideline values set by 10 CFR 100.

The licensee's analysis of theproposed amendment against the three standards in 10 CFR 50.92 is reproducedbelow. <ITAG tagnum="21">1. These changes redefine the power/flow region and required operatoractions from core stability considerations. While the changes allow forunrestricted operation in a region of the power/flow map where previouslysome monitoring requirements were applied, this region has been determinedto be stable. In the power/flow area where instabilities are more likelyto occur an immediate reactor shutdown is imposed. Revised operator actionsare further defined to reduce the possibility of encountering instabilitiesand to rapidly terminate any instabilities should they occur in a regionwhere instabilities are less likely to occur. The proposed changes haveno affect on the core thermal-hydraulic instability phenomena. Therefore,they have no affect on its consequences, should an event occur. Therefore,the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an instability event. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As these changes have no affect on the precursors to any accidentpreviously evaluated, they will not affect the probability of an accidentpreviously evaluated. Since previously evaluated events were evaluatedfor the entire power/flow map and allowed for the proposed operator actions,these changes have no affect on the consequences of those events previouslyevaluated. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of any accident previouslyevaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. These changes do not involve any new design modifications or anynew precursors to an accident. They only redefine areas of the operatingmap for core stability considerations and add conservative operator actions.Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a newor different accident from those previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The proposed changes redefine regions of the power/flow map whichare restricted from operation, eliminate the surveillance region, and redefineoperator actions in the proposed regions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Three stability regions are defined. Region A comprises the area above100% rod-line and below 40% core flow. Region B comprises the area betweenthe 80% and the 100% rod-lines and below 40% core flow. Regions A and Bare restricted from operations. Region C comprises the operating areasabove the 80% rod-line and between 40% and 45% core flow. Operation inRegion C is allowed only for control rod withdrawals during startup. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Operator actions are revised consistent with the redefinition of RegionsA, B and C. Upon entry into Region A, a single action is required, namely,an immediate reactor shutdown. Upon entry into Regions B or C, (unlessoperation in Region C is for control rod withdrawal during startup) animmediate action is required to exit the regions. This action can be eithera reduction in thermal power or an increase in core flow. While operatingin Regions B or C, the APRM neutron flux noise level will be observed.If a sustained APRM neutron flux noise level exceeding 10% peak-to-peakof rated thermal power is observed, an immediate reactor shutdown is required.In addition, with no reactor coolant system recirculation loops in operationin Regions A or B a single action is required, namely, an immediate reactorshutdown. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Region A comprises part of the restricted region in the current TechnicalSpecifications (TS). The operator action proposed in this region, callingfor immmediate reactor shutdown, render [sic] the proposed TS more conservativethan current TS. Proposed operator actions in region B include immediateinitiation of action to exit the region and an immediate reactor shutdownupon detection of oscillations. Thus, the proposed TS are more conservativefor Region B as well. The proposed Region C comprises most of the currentDetect and Suppress region and a triangular area where operation is currentlyrestricted. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Although no instabilities have been observed in Region C, this regionis maintained as a buffer zone. The proposed change restricts operationfrom this region except for certain startup activities. With the proposedactions, including an immediate reactor shutdown upon detection of oscillations,Region C is now more conservative than the current TS. The Detect andamp;Suppress requirements for the triangular portion above the 45% flow lineare deleted since the onset of instabilities in this area is unlikely andno restrictions are needed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, these changes do not involve a significant reduction inthe margin of safety. </ITAG>The licensee has concluded that the proposed amendment meets the threestandards in 10 CFR 50.92 and, therefore, involves no significant hazardsconsideration.

The licensee has concluded, withappropriate bases, that the proposed amendment meets the three standardsin 10 CFR 50.92 and, therefore, involves no significant hazards considerations.The Commission has also provided guidance concerning the application ofthese standards by providing examples of amendments considered likely,and not likely, to involve a significant hazards consideration. These werepublished in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 3, 1986 (51 FR 7744). The NRC staffhas made a preliminary review of the licensee's submittal. A discussionof these examples as they relate to the proposed amendment follows. One of the examples of actions involving no significant hazards consideration(i) involves an administrative change to correct an error or achieve consistencythroughout the Technical Specifications. The changes to the descriptionof the trip function and correction of the pool bottom reference elevationare similar to example (i). Another example of an action involving no significanthazards consideration (ii) is a change that constitutes an additional limitation,restriction, or control not presently included in the TS, e.g. a more stringentsurveillance requirement. The increase in the suppression pool low waterlevel setpoint is similar to this example because it is a more conservativesetpoint. The function of this trip is to actuate the suppression poolmakeup system following a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) when the waterlevel in the suppression pool reaches the trip setpoint. Makeup is neededto assure that the drywell vents will have sufficient submergence to quenchthe steam from the blowdown during the LOCA. Increasing the low level tripsetpoint will increase the minimum submergence of the vents and is, therefore,more conservative. Based on the similarity of the changes to examples (i) and (ii) in 51 FR7744, the NRC staff concludes that the changes in the proposed amendmentare not likely to involve a significant hazards consideration. Accordingly,the Commission proposes to determine that the requested amendment doesnot involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Hinds Junior College, McLendonLibrary, Raymond, Mississippi 39154. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Nicholas S.

TVA is requesting a one-time extension of the 40 27 10-month, TypeA, test interval in Surveillance Requirement (SR) 4.6.1.2.a. The proposedchange would permit the third containment integrated leak rate test (ILRT)to be performed after February 1990, during the Unit 1 Cycle 4 refuelingoutage. TVA proposes to add a footnote to read as follows: ``A one-timeextension of the test interval is allowed for the third Type A test withinthe first 10-year service period provided unit shutdown occurs no laterthan May 1, 1990 and performace of the Type A testing occurs prior to unitrestart following unit 1 cycle 4 refueling outage.'' <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>TVA provided the following information in its application to supportthe proposed change to the SQN TS: <ITAG tagnum="21">SQN's unit 1 entered its cycle 3 refueling outage on August 22, 1985.On December 15, 1985, unit 1 successfully completed its second periodicType A test. Unit 1 returned to power operation on November 10, 1988, followingan extended shutdown period. In accordance with the 40 2710-month testinterval, SQN would be required to perform its third periodic unit 1 TypeA test before February 15, 1990 (50 months). Application of the 40 2710-monthtest interval requires TVA to schedule a unit 1 shutdown sometime during[operating] cycle 4 for the sole purpose of performing a Type A test. TVA'scurrent unit 1 cycle 4 schedule does not include a shutdown for the performanceof a Type A test. The only outage currently scheduled during unit 1 cycle4 is an 8-day outage for conducting an ice condenser flow passage inspection.This outage is scheduled to begin October 1, 1989. This inspection willbe conducted while in mode 4 and will involve entering TS limiting conditionfor operation 3.6.5.1 for a 78-hour duration. The inclusion of a Type Atest to this outage would require entry into mode 5. This would add anadditional 2 to 3 days for temperature stabilization within containment;14 days for setup, testing, and recovery; and 5 days for conducting mode5 surveillance tests. The additional downtime described above would costTVA approximately $2.5 million in replacement power costs. A forced outagefor the sole purpose of performing a Type A test would similarly requirea 22-day outage that would require 2-3 days of deadtime for temperaturestabilization within containment. Based on the above cost options, TVAfinds the extension of the Type A test to coincide with the unit 1 cycle4 refueling outage to be economically prudent. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed modification to the Type A test schedule is a temporaryexemption to the required test interval. The proposed extension of the40 2710-month test interval would enable unit 1 to complete its fourthfuel cycle without requiring a forced shutdown for [ILRT] test purposes.Considering that unit 1 has not experienced any unusual temperature orpressure excursions within the reactor containment building since the lastType A test and considering that no modifications have occurred that wouldhave altered containment integrity, TVA finds no reason to suspect degradationin the unit 1 containment during the approximate 3-year shutdown period.It is important to note that the unit 1 containment structure was ventedto the atmosphere during the extended outage. This configuration precludedany pressure oscillations that would be expected when the containment structureis in a closed condition (i.e., normal purging and/or venting). TVA investigatedthe option of performing a Type A test before the November 1988 unit 1restart. This was discussed with NRC's Office of Special Projects. Fromthese discussions, it was concluded that performance of two Type A testswithin the 3-year extended outage would have imposed undue hardship withlittle or no compensating increase in the level of quality or safety. Forthese reasons, combined with the cost in man-hours for planning, scheduling,and conducting a Type A test, TVA requests a one-time exemption from the40 2710-month test interval of unit 1 SR 4.6.1.2.a. </ITAG>The Commission has provided Standards for determining whether a significanthazards determination exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). 10 CFR 50.91requires that at the time a licensee requests an amendment, it must provideto the Commission its analyses, using the standards in Section 50.92, onthe issue of no significant hazards consideration. Therefore, in accordancewith 10 CFR 50.91 and 10 CFR 50.92, the licensee has performed and providedthe following analysis: <ITAG tagnum="21">TVA has evaluated the proposed TS change and determined that it doesnot represent a significant hazards consideration based on criteria establishedin 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of SQN in accordance with the proposed amendmentwill not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. The proposed change is a one-timeextension of the 40 2710-month, Type A, test interval as contained in SR4.6.1.2.a. The purpose of the Type A test is to ensure that leakage throughthe primary containment and systems and components penetrating primarycontainment does not exceed allowable leakage rate values as specifiedin the TSs (SQN's limit is 0.75 La). Because the most likely leakage pathsthrough containment are the penetrations, TVA completed a local leak ratetest program on all penetrations and valves requiring Types B and C testingbefore unit 1 restart following the unit 1 cycle 3 refueling outage. Thisensured that all Type B and C penetrations and valves were within the allowablecontainment leakage limit of 0.6 La. In addition, TVA performed [SurveillanceInstruction] SI-254 to visually inspect the surfaces of the containmentliner and the shield building for changes in appearance or other abnormaldegradation before unit restart. Performance of these tests, coupled withthe fact that unit 1 remained in cold shutdown condition during an extended3-year period and did not experience any temperature excursions or pressureoscillations since the last Type A test, ensures that containment integritywas maintained during the 3-year shutdown period. On this basis, TVA hasdetermined that the extension of the test interval would not involve asignificant increase in the probability or consequences of an accidentpreviously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any previously analyzed. No new accident scenarios are created bythe proposed change because the one-time extension affects only the testfrequency and does not affect the physical containment structure, the penetrations,or the facility. Previous Type A test results have shown that the leakrates for unit 1 have remained well below the 0.75-La limit. In addition,the unit 1 containment structure has not undergone modifications or beensubjected to thermal or pressure excursions since the last Type A testthat would have altered containment integrity. Because the 0.75-La leakagelimit has not been compromised, the requested extension of the test intervalwill in no way create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any previously analyzed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. SQN's unit1 was shut down for refueling in August 1985 and has remained in cold shutdownsince that time [until its restart in November 1988]. The second regularlyscheduled Type A test for unit 1 was successfully completed in December1985. The data from the December 1985 test indicates a significant marginexists between the measured overall leak rate (0.05388 percent per day)and the 0.75-La limit (0.1875 percent per day). Because unit 1 has remainedin cold shutdown and considering that no modifications have been performedon the containment boundary, the observed margin provided by the December1985 test would not be expected to degrade beyond the 0.75-La leak ratelimit. To ensure this margin is maintained, TVA completed a local leakrate program on all penetrations and valves requiring Types B and C testingbefore the November 1988 restart. In addition, TVA performed SI-254 tovisually inspect the surfaces of the containment liner and the shield buildingfor changes in appearance or other abnormal degradation. Based on theseactions and the previous test margin, the one-time extension of the 402710-month, Type A, test interval would not involve a significant reductionin the margin of safety. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.

TVA intendsto conduct the SQN unit 1, 10-year ISI during the unit 1 cycle 6 refuelingoutage that is currently scheduled to commence in March of 1993. TVA extendedthe SQN unit 1, 10-year ISI interval in accordance with the provisionsof the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) [Code,] SectionXI, Article IWA-2400(c). The first SQN unit 1, 10-year ISI interval beganJuly 1, 1981, and extends through September 15, 1994. Affirmation of thisextension of the 10-year ISI is in preparation for submittal as part ofTVA's commitment for providing NRC with SQN's revised ISI schedule. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">SQN unit 1 entered its cycle 3 refueling outage on August 22, 1985.The second unit 1 ILRT was successfully completed on December 15, 1985.SQN unit 1 continued to remain in a cold shutdown condition (mode 5) overa 3-year period. Unit 1 returned to power operation on November 10, 1988.Because of this unusually long outage time, TVA submitted TS change 89-11to request a one-time extension of the SQN unit 1 ILRT [test] frequency.NRC concurrence with the proposed TS change would allow the third unit1 ILRT to be conducted during the unit 1 cycle 4 refueling outage. Thisone-time extension would require unit 1 shutdown for refueling no laterthan May 1, 1990. The 3-year, unit 1 shutdown period also resulted in adjustmentsto the unit 1, 10-year ISI interval in accordance with the provisions ofASME [Code] Section XI, Article IWA-2400(c). The proposed ILRT [test] extensionand the adjustment in the 10-year ISI interval imposed separate timeframesfor the required performance of the unit 1 ILRT and the scheduled 10-yearISI. To account for this separation, TVA is submitting the [above] request[application dated May 5, 1989] that would allow the third unit 1 ILRTand the 10-year ISI to be uncoupled and performed in separate refuelingoutages. </ITAG>The Commission has provided Standards for determining whether a significanthazards determination exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). 10 CFR 50.91requires that at the time a licensee requests an amendment, it must provideto the Commission its analyses, using the standards in Section 50.92, onthe issue of no significant hazards consideration.

The proposedchange will not reduce the margin of safety as defined in the basis ofSQN TS. The Bases for TS 3/4 6.1.2, ``Containment Leakage,'' states, ``Thesurveillance testing for measuring leakage rates are consistent with therequirements of Appendix J of 10 CFR 50.'' Compliance with the 10 CFR 50,Appendix J, requirements would continue to be maintained with the singleexception that allows the third Type A test and the 10-year ISI not tobe performed during a common unit outage. This uncoupling causes no reductionin the margin of safety since no changes were made to the containment testfrequency or the containment leakage limits assumed in the accident analysis.</ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.

The licensee has evaluated the proposed organization changes against thestandards provided above and has determined that the changes will not decreasethe effectiveness of the WPSC nuclear organization and would involve nosignificant hazards consideration. The staff agrees with this evaluation.The licensee has also evaluated the proposed change that would referencethe OQAP Description, rather that the individual sections of ANSI N18.7-1976,and has determined that there are no significant hazards associated withthis change. The staff agrees with this evaluation. The staff also agreeswith the licensee's determination that there are no significant hazardsassociated with a revision to the TS basis to reflect a design modification.The Commission has provided examples (51 FR 7751) of amendments which arenot likely to involve no significant hazards considerations. One of theseexamples, (i), states: ``A purely administrative change to the technicalspecifications: for example, a change to achieve consistency throughoutthe technical specifications, correction of an error, or a change in nomenclature.''The other proposed changes are similar to this example, and are, therefore,not likely to involve significant hazards considerations. Based on the above, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed amendmentwould involve no significant hazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>University of Wisconsin LibraryLearning Center, 2420 Nicolet Drive, Green Bay, Wisconsin 54301. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>David Baker, Esq.

The Commission has determined foreach of these amendments that the application for the amendment complieswith the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, asamended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commissionhas made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission'srules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the licenseamendment. Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the datethe amendment was needed, there was not time for the Commission to publish,for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Considerationof Issuance of Amendment and Proposed No Significant Hazards ConsiderationDetermination and Opportunity for a Hearing. For exigent circumstances,the Commission has either issued a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice providing opportunity for public commentor has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area surroundinga licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission'sproposed determination of no significant hazards consideration. The Commissionhas provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment, usingits best efforts to make available to the public means of communicationfor the public to respond quickly, and in the case of telephone comments,the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licenseehas been informed of the public comments. In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted,for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant or in preventionof either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up tothe plant's licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunityto provide for public comment on its no significant hazards determination.In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunityfor comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity for public comment.If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, theState has been consulted by telephone whenever possible. Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediatelyeffective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearingfrom any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any requiredhearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards considerationis involved. The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made afinal determination that the amendment involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documentsrelated to this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued andmade effective as indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendmentssatisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impactstatement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments.If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the specialcircumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determinationbased on that assessment, it is so indicated. For further details with respect to the action see (1) the applicationfor amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility Operating License, and (3)the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or EnvironmentalAssessment, as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC, and at the local public document room for the particularfacility involved. A copy of items (2) and (3) may be obtained upon request addressed to theU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Director,Division of Reactor Projects. The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respectto the issuance of the amendments. By June 30, 1989, the licensee may filea request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to thesubject facility operating license and any person whose interest may beaffected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party inthe proceeding must file a written petition for leave to intervene. Requestsfor a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordancewith the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings''in 10 CFR Part 2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to interveneis filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safetyand Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition andthe Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board willissue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceedingand how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested,it will not stay the effectiveness of the amendment. Any hearing held wouldtake place while the amendment is in effect. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date.
