The international human rights group accused security forces inColombia of 2,500 political killings and blamed authorities in Peruand Guatemala for the disappearances, torture, or execution ofhundreds.   It appealed to the Organization of American States, whoseforeign ministers were meeting in Washington, to demonstrate thepolitical will to help eradicate ``abhorrent'' human rightsviolations by government forces and paramilitary groups linked tothem.   In its catalogue of allegations, Amnesty reported that since1988:   _ More than 2,500 civilians in Colombia have been unlawfullykilled for political reasons by the army and paramilitary forcesworking for them, and more than 300 people have disappeared.   _ Hundreds of Peruvians have disappeared, been tortured orkilled by government forces.   _ In Guatemala, hundreds of victims reportedly disappeared orwere illegally executed by members of the security forces operatingin uniform or clandestinely in the guise of death squads.   _ In El Salvador, now mired in some of the worst fighting of itsdecade-old civil war, there was ``persuasive evidence'' that policeand military personnel carried out abductions, disappearances andpolitically motivated killings attributed to death squads.   Amnesty said it has also received reports this year of illegalexecutions or disappearances in other countries in the region,including Brazil and Nicaragua.   It said several countries continued to use the death penalty,which it considers cruel and unusual punishment.   The group noted that so far this year, 14 prisoners have beenexecuted in the United States, and the death row population grew byJuly to an unprecedented 2,210 inmates, including 28 juveniles.   Amnesty said torture is widespread in Latin America and wasroutinely reported in countries where counterinsurgency policiesresulted in patterns of grave human rights violations, includingPeru, Colombia, Guatemala and El Salvador.   Amnesty said it was also concerned about torture reports fromBrazil, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela.   It said political prisoners were being detained in Cuba andPanama.   Amnesty said it welcomed the decision by the Organization ofAmerican States to draft an Inter-American Convention of ForcedDisappearance of Persons.   It said such a document should prohibit secret detention;require that detainees be held only in recognized places ofdetention; and call for readily accessible, up-to-date registers ofdetained people.   Amnesty also said it was important that governments should nottake pre-trial measures to exonerate those accused indisappearances.   It expressed concern about the 1988 presidential pardon ofArgentine military officers charged with human rights violations.It said the move effectively obstructed further investigation intothe disappearance of thousands of people under military governmentsin the 1970s and early 1980s.</TEXT></DOC>
