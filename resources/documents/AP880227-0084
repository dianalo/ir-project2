(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A union representing 6,700 flight attendantsat Northwest Airlines called a strike today after all-nightnegotiations collapsed, a union official said.   William Genoese, international director of the Teamsters union'sairline division, said workers were being told to walk out, butrefused to specify how broad the walkout would be.   ``It might be one city, it might be two cities, it might bethree cities,'' said Genoese when asked whether the strike wasgeneral or selective. Genoese, who had earlier said selectivestrikes were possible to disrupt the airline's services, refused toelaborate.   A spokesman for Northwest said today the airline was preparingto carry out its strike-management program, but added that therewas as yet no concrete sign that a strike had started.   ``We did everything we possibly could to avoid a strike,''Genoese said. ``Apparently the company feels it wants to take astrike on. If we want to close down the airline, we can close itdown. They've got their hands full.''   Teamsters spokeswoman Barbara Graham, at union temporary officesat hotel near Detroit Metropolitan Airport, said shortly afterGenoese's announcement that she had received no notice of a strike,but that the union was standing by.   ``We're proceeding to implement our contingency plan,'' vicepresident of law and labor relations Terry Erskine said atNorthwest headquarters. About 2,000 managers trained as flightattendants have been posted throughout the Northwest system with200 newly-hired replacement flight attendants also ready to move,he said.   Erskine said the airline was prepared to handle the strike.``We've been through this fire drill before,'' he said.   Representatives for Northwest Airlines and the union hadcontinued negotiations after a midnight EST deadline. In earlierstatements, Genoese said selective strikes would be used to keepthe airline off balance.   ``When you have them off balance, they can't put out the firethere and the fire over here,'' Genoese said early this morning.``That works to our advantage in the situation.''   Genoese said selective strikes would begin taking place atvarious locations throughout the Northwest system to _ in his words_ ``disrupt their service.''   ``We have a right to do it,'' Genoese said.   Some 6,700 Northwest flight attendants are represented byTeamsters Local 2747.   Jim Halverson, a spokesman for the Northwest unit of the AirLine Pilots Association, said about 20 union officials meeting inBloomington Friday night would debate whether to honor picket lines.   ``We feel we can pull a strike off without (the pilots')support,'' Local 2747 spokesman Jeff Musto said. ``If we get it itwill be like an ace in the hand.''   The machinists union representing Northwest mechanics gave itssupport to an attendants' strike, but union representatives did notsay whether machinists would honor attendants' picket lines.   Northwest spokesman Redmond Tyler said the machinists are undera contract that forbids them to strike in sympathy with anotherunion.   Wage scales, pensions and work rules are among the major issuesin the dispute. Former Republic Airlines flight attendants havebeen working under their old contract since Northwest acquiredRepublic in 1986, and many former Republic employees are paid lessthan their Northwest counterparts.   The company, the nation's fifth-largest airline, is trying tobring the workers under one contract and offered to bring formerRepublic employees up to the salary levels of Northwest employees.But the union claimed the airline is compensating by reducingvacation pay and retirement benefits.</TEXT></DOC>
