Chairman David Roderick received a$600,000 bonus last year in addition to his $763,982 salary andother top executives also received substantial bonuses, accordingto the oil and steel giant's annual proxy statement.   The 1987 bonuses came as USX significantly improved itsfinancial performance, posting a profit of $219 million in 1987after losing $1.83 billion in 1986.   USX bonuses are set individually by the board of directors'six-member compensation committee, based on the total amount ofincentive compensation available as determined by the entire board.   Roderick's bonus was his highest ever, said USX spokesmanWilliam Ryder. Roderick's last disclosed bonus was $275,000 in 1985.   USX did not report any incentive compensation for its topexecutives in 1986. That means it either did not pay bonuses orawarded bonuses worth less than $25,000, which need not bedisclosed, Ryder said.   Hourly workers at USX will receive extra compensation this yearunder a profit-sharing plan. USX said in January it would pay about$28 million, or an average of $1,700 apiece, to its steelworkersunder the plan.   Those payments were triggered by a formula based on the stockprices of USX's competitors.   Other top USX executives and their 1987 earnings include:   _Charles A. Corry, president of the diversified businesses andrecently named president of USX, who received salary of $301,020and a $245,000 bonus.   _Thomas C.
