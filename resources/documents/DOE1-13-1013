Based on the annual cost method,the long-term economics of the plant is evaluated by the annual totalcost, which is the objective function to be minimized. This optimal planningproblem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem,and the optimal solution is derived by adopting the branch and boundmethod. As a result, both the configuration of the plant equipment andthe operational policy are optimally determined reflecting the differencein economics and efficiency of the scale of each equipment. In addition,both the power to be purchased and the value of maximum contract demandof the purchased power is optimally determined. Using a numerical example,the validity and effectiveness of the optimal planning method proposedhere is ascertained.</TEXT></DOC>
