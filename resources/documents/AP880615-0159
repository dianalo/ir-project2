LIM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hundreds of radical students shouting``Boycott military training!'' hurled rocks and firebombs Wednesdayat riot police who moved in to break up the protest. No seriousinjuries were reported.   The protest at Chungang University in Seoul turned violent whenhundreds of riot police marched on campus and fired tear gas todisperse about 1,000 students from five Seoul colleges.   Waves of masked students immediately dashed out and peltedtroopers with rocks and scores of flaming gasoline bombs. Femalestudents beat drums and carried rocks to encourage the protesters.   A number of students and policemen were hit by rocks and otherobjects, but no serious injuries were reported.   Fighting started when students were preparing to march into thestreet and continued for several hours, as students shouted ``Driveout Yankees who hinder unification!''   The students demanded an end to compulsory military training forcollege students, denouncing the government of President RohTae-woo and the United States. They contend military training forstudents was ``preparation of machinery for the Yankees.''   All male college students in South Korea are required to undergoweekly military training on campus, along with an weeklong trainingsession at military barracks.   Student speakers at a rally before the clash also demanded theexpulsion of the 42,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea undera mutual defense pact, accusing the United States of hinderingunification of the Korean peninsula.   Radical students want immediate reunification of the two Koreas,divided since the end of World War II. They contend the UnitedStates enforces partition of the peninsula to rule the South as acolony.   The radicals, a small but powerful minority on college campuses,have failed to attract public support.   Major street clashes occurred in Seoul on Friday when riotpolice blocked thousands of radical students trying to march to theborder for talks with North Kroean students. The two Koreas remainbitter enemies since the Communist North invaded the South in 1950and started the three-year Korean War.   On Wednesday, minor clashes were reported from the central cityof Taejon, when students demonstrated off campus to protest agovernment ban on last week's march to the North Korean border.   About 10 radical students staged a dawn attack with firebombsWednesday on an office of the government party in Seoul, policesaid. The firebombs missed and caused no damage.   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent anti-governmentand anti-U.S. protests in the past months. Police said Wednesdaythat so far this year, they fired more than 270,000 rounds of teargas to block demonstrations.</TEXT></DOC>
