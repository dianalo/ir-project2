The measure _ which includes a subminimum wage for teen-agersnew to the job market _ cleared the Senate on an 89-8 voteWednesday, exactly a week after it passed the House by an equallyoverwhelming vote of 382-37.   Bush, who struck the compromise plan with congressionalDemocrats last week, is expected to sign the bill beforeThanksgiving, perhaps as early as next week.   ``The nine-year logjam on the minimum wage is finally broken,''Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said after the Senate vote. ``Theworking poor are about to receive an increase, although it is notas much as they deserve.''   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, speaking for the Bushadministration, said ``the 3 million American workers currently onthe minimum wage will benefit.'' But she said skills training wasthe best way to help the working poor and urged Congress to moveahead with legislation dealing with that issue.   ``The minimum wage is not the pulley to pull people out ofpoverty,'' she said.   The compromise plan will push the minimum wage, $3.35 an hoursince January 1981, to $3.80 on April 1 and to $4.25 a year later.At the same time, it will create a new, lower wage for 16- to19-year-old workers who are new to the job market.   Democrats and organized labor long have opposed such asubminimum ``training wage'' but were forced to concede that pointto Bush to strike the deal. In return, Bush agreed to have theminimum wage reach $4.25 nine months earlier than he had proposedand also accepted a far more restrictive training wage than hesought earlier this year.   Labor played down its concessions in calling on Bush to quicklysign the measure into law.   ``America's poorest workers have gone nearly a decade without araise and this long-overdue step will give them a chance to liftthemselves and their families out of poverty,'' AFL-CIO PresidentLane Kirkland said.   Even as they praised Bush for agreeing to the compromise,Democrats said they would seek another increase heading into the1992 presidential elections, when Bush likely will be seeking asecond term.   Both sides made significant concessions to reach the compromisefour months after Bush vetoed an earlier Democratic minimum-wageplan.   In addition to agreeing to a subminimum, Democrats and laborscaled back their final minimum-wage target; the measure Bushvetoed called for an increase to $4.55 an hour.   The White House, under increasing pressure from GOP lawmakersseeking to avoid another veto battle heading into 1990 electionsyear, agreed to a timetable reaching the $4.25 level nine monthsbefore Bush had proposed.   Bush also accepted a training wage that can only be paid toworkers 16 to 19 years old for their first three months of workexperience and for another three months if certified training isprovided. The provision allowing the subminimum expires in April1993.   Under the plan, the subminimum wage will be $3.35 on April 1 and$3.61 a year later.   Bush wanted to allow the lower wage to be paid to all workers,regardless of age, for their first six months on any new job,regardless of past work experience.   All eight senators voting against the measure were Republicans.They were Sens. William Armstrong of Colorado, Hatch and Jake Garnof Utah, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Gordon Humphrey of NewHampshire, Connie Mack of Florida, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, andSteve Symms of Idaho. Three senators did not vote: Max Baucus,D-Mont., Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, and Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.</TEXT></DOC>
