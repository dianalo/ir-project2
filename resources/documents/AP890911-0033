The six-month increase of 46,004 inmates was higher than anyfull-year increase recorded during the 64 years that the governmenthas counted prisoners, the bureau said Sunday.   The largest annual increase ever recorded was in 1981-82, whenthe national prison population grew by 41,060 inmates, from 344,283to 385,343, said Tom Hester of the bureau.   The surge in prison population during the first half of 1989 wasbrought about by increases of 7 percent in the number of menimprisoned and 13 percent in the number of women, the bureau said.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the increase was ``anindication that more criminals, many convicted of drug-relatedoffenses, are being caught and punished.''   ``The criminal justice system is working,'' Thornburgh said in astatement. ``People who break the law do pay the price.''   The figures dramatize the need for almost 1,800 new prison beds aweek, the bureau said. ``Congress needs to act swiftly on PresidentBush's violent crime legislation, which provides for theconstruction of more than 24,000 new federal prison beds,''Thornburgh said.   The national drug control strategy, announced by Bush lastTuesday, echoed the crime legislation Bush called for in May inseeking $1.2 billion in 1990 budget authorization for additionalfederal prison space.   Most of the increase from Dec. 31, 1988, to June 30, 1989,occurred in the state prison systems, where the population grew by41,214 or 7.1 percent, from 577,633 at the end of 1988 to 618,847 atthe end of June. During the same period, the federal prisonpopulation expanded by 4,790, a 9.7 percent increase from 49,928 to54,718.   During the six-month period, nine jurisdictions reporteddouble-digit growth in their inmate populations: Rhode Island, 20.3percent; South Dakota, 19.9 percent; Connecticut, 18.4 percent;Utah, 13.2 percent; the District of Columbia, 12.1 percent; Idaho,11.3 percent; Mississippi, 10.6 percent; Missouri, 10.4 percent; andKentucky, 10.2 percent.   Two states experienced declines in prison populations _Tennessee, down 2.3 percent, and North Dakota, down 2.1 percent. AndTexas had such a small increase, only 2 prisoners more, that thechange was listed as 0 percent.   Since 1980, the number of state and federal prisoners servingsentences of more than one year _ known as sentenced prisoners _more than doubled, from 315,974, while four states recorded atripling of such inmates _ California, New Hampshire, Alaska and NewJersey.   An additional 25 states and the District of Columbia doubledtheir prison populations.   Overall, the number of sentenced prisoners as of June 30 was 260per 100,000 population, with 18 of them in federal prisons and 242in state institutions. On Dec. 31, 1980, there were 139 sentencedprisoners per 100,000 population, the bureau said.</TEXT></DOC>
