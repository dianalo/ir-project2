Sizes range from a few kilowatts to hundreds of megawatts.The growth in the number and capacity of cogeneration and small powerfacilities filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)has increased from a capacity of slightly over 700 MW in 1980 to a capacityof approximately 47,000 MW in 1986. By far the largest capacity, over65% since 1980, consists of natural gas fired cogeneration facilities.The Gas Research Institute estimates that an additional 25,500 megawattsof natural gas fired cogeneration capacity will be added between 1987and the year 2000. The vast majority of these, in terms of capacity,consist of combustion gas turbine generators with heat recovery boilersor other means of heat recovery. Combustion gas turbines are being appliedso widely because of the following characteristics: flexibility of cogenerationcycles; faster installation time; and lower installed cost. The paperdescribes cogeneration cycles, cost and economics, and cogeneration benefits.</TEXT></DOC>
