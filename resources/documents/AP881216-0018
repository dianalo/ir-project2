Even so, more than half of last year's 46,386 traffic fatalitiesdied in accidents involving alcohol, indicating the problem ofdrunken driving remains a serious one, the national Centers forDisease Control reported Thursday.   ``This is one of those problems that has been going on for a longtime in the United States,'' said Dr. Richard Waxweiler, chief ofthe epidemiology branch at the CDC's Division of Injury Epidemiologyand Control.   ``It's not like some new disease or epidemic that grabseverybody's attention.''   In 1987, 23,632 people were killed in the United States in motorvehicle crashes in which alcohol was involved, or 51 percent of allU.S. traffic fatalities, the CDC said. That compares with 25,165killed in 1982 in alcohol-related crashes, or 57 percent of the43,945 traffic fatalities that year.   The number of deaths in accidents in which no one had beendrinking rose from 18,780, or 43 percent, in 1982 to 22,754, or 49percent, in 1987. Conversely, the deaths in the most stronglyalcohol-related accidents _ those in which at least one party testedabove .10 on a blood-alcohol test _ declined from 20,356, or 46percent, in 1982 to 18,529, or 40 percent, in 1987, according tostatistics from the NHTSA data.   The proportion of alcohol-related traffic fatalities may havefallen, the CDC said, because of three factors: ``increased publicawareness of the problem, enactment of more stringent laws andincreased enforcement ... and laws that raised the drinking age to21 in all states.''   Although exact figures were not presented, the CDC noted that theproportion of drivers intoxicated at the time of a fatal crash fell17 percent from 1982 to 1987, and the proportion of teen-age drunkendrivers involved in fatal crashes fell 34 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
