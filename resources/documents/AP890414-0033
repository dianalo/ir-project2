The package survived its biggest challenge so far on Thursdaywhen congressional Democrats capitulated to Bush's financingscheme, which is designed to keep the $50 billion taxpayer costfrom showing up in the federal deficit.   The House Banking Committee's financial institutionssubcommittee, a legislative safehouse for the savings industry inthe past, approved the overall plan after amending it to let Sandamp;Lowners put up less money to stay in business than Bush had wanted.   A day earlier, the Senate Banking Committee approved the packageafter also weakening, but to a lesser degree, the capital standardsthat thrifts must meet in the future to qualify for federal depositinsurance.   The federal Sandamp;L insurance fund is now more than $25 billion inthe hole because of loans that turned sour and, in many cases,fraudulent lending and accounting practices usinggovernment-insured deposits.   Another $50 billion in uncovered loan losses loom just over thehorizon for 350 more insolvent thrift institutions that thegovernment is keeping open now only because it doesn't have themoney to close or merge them.   The full Senate plans to take up the bill Monday with the aim ofpassing it Wednesday before recessing for Passover. In the House,the bill now goes to the full Banking Committee, where Bush may winback some of the tougher capital and regulatory requirements helost in the subcommittee.   ``The Senate gave Bush about 80 to 85 percent of what he wantsand we gave him 60 to 65 percent,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer,D-N.Y., a subcommittee member who was on the losing side of a 24-23vote to cut Bush's proposed capital requirements.   ``By the time it's all over, he may get 90 to 95 percent of whathe wants,'' Schumer said, referring to the $6 that Sandamp;L owners wouldhave to have in capital for every $100 they lend _ the same levelnow required of banks.   The subcommittee, on an amendment by its chairman, Rep. FrankAnnunzio, D-Ill., and Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., voted to keep thepresent requirement _ $3 in capital for every $100 of lending.   But it also tightened the standards in one significant way bysaying at least half that amount, or $1.50 for each $100 in loans,must be in ``tangible'' assets or real money that the owners couldlose.   The administration and congressional auditors have blamed partof the Sandamp;L crisis on ``smoke and mirrors'' accounting practicesthat Congress and regulators authorized, allowing thrifts to countnon-cash items such as good will and deferred loan losses ascapital.   The administration is still unhappy with House and Senateprovisions that would permit capital-deficient thrifts to continuegrowing. Under its proposal, capital-weak institutions would havebeen required to shrink their operations or merge with a healthierpartner.   ``It's really building the skyscraper on quicksand,'' said L.William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,which under the bill will have expanded responsibility to insuredeposits in Sandamp;Ls as well as commercial banks.   The House panel also voted to increase from $50 million to $75million the amount Bush had requested for the Justice Department topursue criminal fraud and conspiracy charges against Sandamp;L executiveswho loaned or invested deposits illegally.   And it amended Bush's plan to allow banks to begin buying upboth insolvent and healthy thrift institutions immediately. Indeference to small banks and the thrift industry, Bush had proposedallowing banks to buy only ailing Sandamp;Ls for the next two years andhealthy ones as well after that.   ``The one question we are repeatedly asked is what are we doingto bring more capital into a capital-deficit industry,'' said Rep.Doug Barnard, D-Ga. ``This is the one thing we can do.''   Opponents, however, fear that change will increase taxpayercosts because banks will buy only healthy Sandamp;Ls, leaving thegovernment stuck to pick up all the losses of the insolvent ones.   While the banks won that issue, they lost another one to theinsurance industry. The subcommittee voted to declare a 2{-yearmoratorium on allowing more than $100,000 of multimillion-dollarbank investment certificates to be covered by federal insurance.   In the past two years, banks have started using the certificatesoffering fixed interest rates to lure pension plan funds away frominsurance companies, which have no federal deposit insurance.   The real estate industry also won a major victory in both Houseand Senate versions through amendments that would require statelicensing of appraisers. That legislation had been stalled foryears out of fears that real estate brokers would use it tomonopolize and sharply increase appraisal fees.</TEXT></DOC>
