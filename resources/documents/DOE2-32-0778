Itis mass transfer by the electric force caused by interaction betweentrue charges or polarized charges in a fluid and external electric filedthat plays an important role in most of such heat transfer augmentationmethods by EHD. Examples of heat transfer augmentation by EHD phenomenainclude electricaly induced convection, contribution of EHD effect toheat transfer accompanied with boiling, heat transfer by corona windaccompanied with corona discharge, vapor film condensation and heat transferaugmentation by EHD effects, heat transfer augmentation by mixing a dispersionmedium, and so on.
