(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Making a Small Net WorkandM;When you bought your first couple of Macs and a LaserWriter, the salespersontold you that every Macintosh came with a built-in network.andP;  All you had todo was buy a few inexpensive PhoneNET connectors and plug them together tohave your Macs communicating effortlessly with your printer.andP;  No muss, nofuss.andP;  So you did, it worked, and the computer dealer had another satisfiedcustomer.andM;But times have changed, and simple Mac-to-printer connectivity is no longerenough.andP;  You started with two Macs; now you hve a dozen.andP;  You want to sendE-mail to coworkers hundreds of feet -- or miles -- away.andP;  Your work groupneeds to share sales figures and other records on a multiuser database.andP;  Andinstead of relying on floppy disks and SneakerNet to transfer files, you wantto send them over the wires at the click of a mouse.andM;Congratulations -- you've graduated from stand-alone computers to a smallwork group.andP;  Electronic work groups are the true lifeblood of mostorganizations; even large networks consisting of hundreds of Macs are usuallybroken down into work groups of 5 to 15 machines.andM;But as your needs have grown, so have the system requirements.andP;  LocalTalk anda few cables are no longer enough.andP;  To optimize your work group'sperformance, you may need more powerful tools, such asandM;Ethernet or a file server.andP;   But where do you start?andP;  Is a networkandM;speed booster such as Ethernet worth the cost?andP;  Or would a file server be abetter choice?andM;To help you spend your networking dollars wisely, MacUser Labs evaluated theoptions in the three areas that most affect work-group performance:  thecircuitry that sends electronic signals between computers, the type ofcomputer used as a file server, and the server software.andP;  We did our testingon a network containing 2 to 15 Macintoshes, since that represents thetypical work-groupandM;configuration.andP;  Our coverage is in two parts.andP;   The first reportandM;looks at communications circuitry and server hardware, while the second pitsAppleShare against TOPS in the software arena.andM;The cheapest way to transmit network signals is to use LocalTalk, whichconsists of the Mac's built-in circuitry plus the appropriate cables.andP;  Ourfirst report, &quot;Signals and Servers,&quot; compares the cost-effectiveness ofLocalTalk with that of Ethernet, a popular replacement that's availableeither as an internal card or an external box.andP;  Ethernet is much faster thanLocalTalk; unfortunately, it's also much more expensive.andP;  Does Ethernet payfor itself on a small network?andP;  Read on and see.andM;For many people, upgrading a netwrok means adding (or upgrading) a fileserver.andP;  A file server is simply a computer (some kind of microprocessor)with a hard disk attached, running special software.andP;  On a busy network, fileservers can handle many chores.andP;  They can be print spoolers, repositories forshared files and multiuser databases, or the &quot;post office&quot; for an E-mailsystem.andP;  Unlike the files on your own hard disk, which are for your eyesonly, the files (and folderse on a file server are potentially accessible toeveryone on the network.andM;On a Mac network, the file-server hardware is usually another Macintosh.andP;  Butsince Apple now offers five kinds of Mac (six by time you read this), thechoice isn't as clear-cut as it might first appear.andP;  Can you use a Plus for afile server, or will you need a IIx?andP;  What about the new SE/30?andP;  Or how abouta cheap PC with a DayStar server?andP;  How much RAM should the server have?andM;MacUser Labs compared the file-server performance of five different Macintoshmodels and one PC.andP;  We also checked their RAM requirements and evaluated whenupgrading a file server might be more worthwhile than switching to Ethernet.andO;You'll find our recommendations in the first report.andM;Once you've chosen your communications protocol and file-server hardware, youmust still decide on server software.andP;  Our second report, &quot;Two for the Node,&quot;looks at the competition between TOPS and AppleShare.andP;  Their approaches tofile serving are vastly different; AppleShare is a centralized serverrequiring a dedicated Mac, while TOPS can be distributed over the entirenetwork.andP;  The right choice for your network depends on its size,applications, and security concerns.andM;The performance tests and feature comparisons in these reports will help youdetermine the right configuration for your particular situation.andP;  Along theway, we've sprinkled a few tidbits about other options, including newLocalTalk alternatives form TOPS and Dayna, and the latest in file serversfrom Jasmine and from Information Presentation Technologies.andP;  When you'refinished reading, you'll have all the information necessary to harness thehorsepower you need for your work group.andM;Signals and ServersandM;Networking -- not the kind you do over lunch but the communication betweencomputers -- is revolutionizing the way we work with other people.andP;  Documentsthat once were photocopied and hand-delivered are now sent electronically.andO;The niceties of networking enable us to share information via multiuserdatabases.andP;  Instead of chatting by the watercooler, we send E-mail.andM;Today, most Macintoshes are part of work groups -- small networks consistingof 2 to 15 macs.andP;  As the size and complexity of the shared informationincreases, so does the need for speed.andP;  No one likes to watch the hands onthe clock cursor spin for minutes at a time while a large file is copiedbetween machines.andM;You've finally decided to bite the bullet and upgrade your network, but wheredo you start?andP;  Leafing through the magazine ads, you see a bewildering arrayof software, add-on boards, and cabling schemes.andP;  To help you sort out theoptions, MacUser Labs set up a 15-node network of Mac Pluses, SEs, IIs, AIIx, an SE/30, and even a PC.andP;  We then conducted exhaustive tests on threekey components of small networks: communications circuitry, file-serverhardware, and server software.andP;  The first two of these are covered in thisreport; the third--a comparison of TOPS and AppleShare--is the subject of thefollowing report (see &quot;Two for the Node&quot;).andM;The speed of intercomputer communications is one of the limiting factors innetwork performance.andP;  Accordingly, our first series of tests pittedLocalTalk, the Mac's built-in circuitry, against Ethernet, a popularreplacement, to see which was more productive and cost-effective at thework-group level.andP;  We developed benchmarks that mimicked the typical tasksperformed on a small network (see sidebar, &quot;Network Benchmarks&quot;) and putLocalTalk and Ethernet through their paces using an SE with an AppleSharefile server.andM;We then used the same battery of tests to evaluate the performance of fivedifferent Macintosh models plus a PC as file servers.andP;  This time around,LocalTalk and AppleShare were the constants, and the variable was the machinebeing used as a server.andM;Some of our results may surprise you.andP;  But before detailing our findings,let's take a short detour through the Byzantine world of networkcommunications, starting with AppleTalk.andM;Blueprint for a NetworkandM;AppleTalk isn't a wire, a circuit, or a piece of code.andP;  It's a set ofspecifications, a blueprint that defines everything about the Macintoshnetwork.andP;  AppleTalk defines the built-in hardware that sends signals out ofthe Mac's printer port.andP;  It also defines the signals themselves.andP;  It defineshow files will be passed along the network, how Macs will recognize eachother over the network, and how a file server will appear on your Macintosh'sdesktop.andM;The blueprint for AppleTalk is based on an industrywide standard fortelecommunications protocols.andP;  This standard, called the Open SystemsInterconnect (OSI) reference model, was developed to promote connectivityamong different kinds of computers and operating systems.andP;  The OSI model is amodular approach that breaks up the different aspects of moving data througha network into specific, interconnected task called layers.andP;  There are sevenlayers in all, each building on the one below it.andP;  Because the layers aremodular, each can be replaced with an equivalent layer that also follows theOSI model.andM;In AppleTalk's implementation, LocalTalk makes up the bottom two layers.andP;  Ineffect, LocalTalk consists of three things: a chip near the printer port thatsends and receives network signals, a software driver that controls datatransmission, and LocalTalk cabling.andP;  The cables can be swapped out forPhoneNET or fiber-optic cabling.andP;  The chip and the accompanying software canbe replaced by other OSI-based standards such as Ethernet.andM;Note that when you substitute Ethernet for LocalTalk, you replace only asmall part of AppleTalk; the rest remains intact.andP;  Thus, you remain part ofan AppleTalk network even if you switch to Ethernet.andM;The Ethernet AlternativeandM;If you're a network speed freak, you may be familiar with Ethernet, the mostpopular replacement for LocalTalk.andP;  Originally developed at Xeros, Ethernetis an international standard for network communications that has long beenavailable on minicomputers and PCs.andP;  More recently, Apple has endorsed it asa highspeed alternative to LocalTalk.andP;  In can transmit data at frequencies ofup to 10 million bits per second (bps), while LocalTalk pokes along at230,400 bps.andM;Ethernet replaces the LocalTalk chip with a board in the Mac's expansion slotand has its own software driver, called EtherTalk, that handles datatransmission.andP;  Instead of plugging a network cable into the Mac's printerport, you plug it into the connector on the Ethernet card, and you're readyfor action.andM;Ethernet is faster than LocalTalk because of its high-powered transmittinghardware -- not, as some people think, because of the thicker cable it oftenuses.andP;  Network signals travel at the same speed regardless of the wire.andO;Ethernet is faster because it sends out more data during a given period.andO;Higher frequency translates into greater speed from the user's point of view.andM;Ethernet has other advantages besides speed, but they primarily benefit largenetworks.andP;  For instance, performance degrades at a much slower rate than onLocalTalk.andP;  A LocalTalk work group or zone peters out at somewhere between 30and 50 nodes; Ethernet can support 254 Macs.andP;  Ethernet also lets you hook upto larger networks with different operating systems, such as that of DEC'sVAX minicomputers.andM;Speed CostsandM;Unfortunately, Ethernet is not cheap; add-on boards and external SCSI boxesrun from $500 to $1,300 per Mac.andP;  But vendors are plentiful, so shop aroundfor the best deal.andM;Kinetics was an early supplier of Ethernet boards for the Mac.andP;  Its EtherPortline includes add-on boards for the SE and II ($695) and the SE/30 ($795, notyet shipping at press time), and the EthersSC box for the Mac Plus($1,150-$1,250).andP;  FastPath 4 ($2,795) is a bridge that lets you connect anEthernet network to a LaserWriter or to a LocalTalk network.andM;Dove's FastNet line of Ethernet products ($599-$1,249) is similar to that ofKinetics, with cards for the SE, SE/30, and II, and a SCSI box for the MacPlus.andP;  Dove also makes the MaraThon LAN 020 ($1,499) for the SE, a board thatcombines Ethernet connectivity with a 68020 accelerator.andM;The cheapest way to add Ethernet to any Mac is with Adaptec's Nodem$(545-$595), an external SCSI box that works with the Plus, SE, and II.andP;  Alow-cost alternative for the SE is the IPT1000 from Information PresentationTechnologies.andP;  This $495 board contains an AMD 7990 Ethernet controller andfeatures direct memory access (DMA), which delivers data directly to RAM,bypassing the CPU and freeing it for other tasks.andM;New arrivals to the Mac Ethernet market include 3Com, which is marketing theEtherLink/SE board ($595), and Novell, which planned April ship dates for theNAE/1000 ($495) for the SE and the NAE/2000 ($595) for the II and IIx.andP;  EvenApple offers an add-on board for the II and IIx -- the EtherTalk InterfaceCard ($699).andM;If you're thinking that these prices don't seem that bad, keep in mind thatLocalTalk, which comes built into every Mac, is free (except for the cables).andO;If you're like most of us, you'll need to justify that need for extra speed.andO;However, keep an eye out for two new LocalTalk replacements, FlashBox andDaynaTALK.andP;  They can send data faster than LocalTalk and are substantiallycheaper than Ethernet (see sidebar, &quot;More Talk&quot;).andM;All Wired UpandM;The circuitry for both LocalTalk and Ethernet can transmit signals over avariety of cables, from twisted-pair wiring to coaxial cable to fiber optics.andO;The standard LocalTalk cabling is twisted pair, a simple, two-wire schemecommonly used in phone wires.andP;  Ethernet generally uses coaxial cable, whichis the same type of wiring used for cable televisionandM;As mentioned previously, your choice of wiring has little effect on networkspeed.andP;  In fact, Du Pont's fiber-optic cabling operates at the same speed asApple's LocalTalk wire when used with the Mac's built-in LocalTalk circuitry,and at Ethernet speeds when used with an add-on Ethernet card.andM;Although you don't need to worry about speed when choosing wiring, you mightwant to consider the maximum distance the wire can carry a signal.andP;  This is aconcern mainly for large networks, but it's useful information if you plan toexpand your work group.andM;How far a wire can transmit a signal depends on how wide the wire is and howit's shielded and grounded.andP;  In general, the fatter the wire, the farther itwill carry a signal before petering out.andP;  Apple's LocalTalk cable can relay asignal only 1,000 feet.andP;  Farallon's PhoneNET, which uses telephone wire andspecial connector boxes, extends the maximum distance to between 1,800 and4,500 feet, depending on the gauge of wire used.andM;Fiber-optic cabling extends this even farther to 4,900 feet between nodes andcan be used as a backbone for connecting work groups located some distanceapart.andP;  It's impervious to electromagnetic interference and very difficult towiretap--an important consideration for high-security installations.andP;  As youmight expect, you pay a price for these benefits; Du Pont's fiber-opticcabling for the Mac costs a minimum of $300 to $600 per node.andP;  By contrast,PhoneNET is only $59.95 per node or $395 for ten nodes.andM;Switching SignalsandM;When should you replace LocalTalk with Ethernet?andP;  To find out, we tested bothof them on a network containing to 15 Macs.andP;  Using an SE with an AppleSharefile server, we measured the time it took to perform four tasks: print afile, copy a large file, open a server-resident file, and read aserver-resident database.andP;  The tests were repeated as we steadily increasedthe number of Macs on the network to a maximum of 15 (see sidebar, &quot;NetworkBenchmarks&quot;).andM;Although Ethernet theoretically can transmit at 10 million bps, that doesn'tmean that it's 40 times faster than LocalTalk in real situations.andP;  Our testsdemonstrated that, at best, Ethernet is only about twice as fast as LocalTalkon a small network; the average gain was only 20 percent.andP;  This is becauseneither system operates at its maximum transfer rate.andP;  On either system,whenever a signal is sent out, it's broadcast everywhere over the network atvelocities near the speed of light.andP;  However, if another computer transmits amessage at the same time, the two signals collide and must be sent again bytheir respective computers.andP;  As the number of machines in use increases, sodo the chances for collisions.andP;  As a result, the average network speeds areslower than the theoretical maximums.andM;LocalTalk was designed for small networks, and it seems well suited to itstask.andP;  Our benchmark tests showed that it can handle ten nodes withoutdegradation.andP;  At 15 nodes, overall performance was about 10 percent slower.andO;Obviously, the more nodes you add, the slower a LocalTalk network becomes.andM;Ethernet, on the other hand, was designed for large networks of severalhundred nodes.andP;  Our tests showed a slight degradation en we increased networksize from 2 to 5 nodes.andP;  After that, network speeds were constant up to the15 nodes we tested.andP;  Typically, you'd need to have several dozen nodes beforeyou'd see degradation in Ethernet performance.andM;Ethernet was the clear winner in transferring large files; it cut the time todownload a 500K file by about 43 percent on the average (see Figure 2).andO;Clearly, a work group that uses its network primarily for passing large files-- such as graphics, CAD, or scientific applications -- would benefit greatlyfrom Ethernet.andM;However, Ethernet was less helpful for other network tasks, which turned outto depend more on file-server speed.andP;  Ethernet was about 4.2 percent fasterthan LocalTalk when opening a spreadsheet file located on the server disk,and about 19 percent faster when reading a server-resident database.andP;  As wediscuss later, the speed of these two functions was increased more bychanging the Mac SE server to an SE/30 or II than by replacing LocalTalk withEthernet.andM;Ethernet had no effect on the printing speed of a LaserWriter.andP;  Because aLaserWriter will run only on LocalTalk, you must have a bridge between theEthernet card and the printer.andP;  We used Kinetics' FastPath 4 hardware bridge,which lists at $2,795, but you might want to consider Liaison, the innovativesoftware bridge from Infosphere (Portland, Oregon), which costs only $295.andM;Servers with a SmileandM;OK, so upgrading the file server will boost a small network's performancemore than switching to Ethernet will.andP;  But which Mac makes the best server?andO;Using the same battery of tests, we tested the file-server performance of theMac Plus, SE, SE/30, II, and IIx on a network of up to 15 machines.andP;  In eachcase, we used LocalTalk wiring and AppleShare server software.andM;The same hard disk, an Apple 40SC, was used for all the server tests.andP;  Toensure that the hard disk itself wasn't affecting server performance, weconducted some tests using FWB's Hammer 30 hard disk, which has a fasteraccess time.andP;  The results were almost identical, indicating that your choiceof hard disk has little effect on file-server performance.andM;For a small network, our test results point unquestionably to the SE/30 asthe optimum file server.andP;  If you already have a Mac II in-house, it will workjust as well, but it's more expensive.andP;  However, a Mac II can be used as aserver without a monitor, video card, or keyboard (see sidebar, &quot;The HeadlessServer&quot;), which reduces its cost.andP;  The Mac IIx should not be used as a fileserver; its performance was only marginally better than that of a II orSE/30, but it costs $1,800 more than a Mac II.andM;On a network with 15 nodes, the SE/30 cut the time it took another Mac toread a server-resident database by 60 percent over a Plus, and by 50 percentover an SE (see Figure 3).andP;  This Database Read test is important because it'ssimilar to how some E-mail systems work and therefore indicates how somedatabase-based E-mail servers might perform.andM;The performance of an SE/30 or Mac II server was also less affected than thatof the Plus or SE by the addition of more workstations.andP;  Overall, serverperformance for the Plus and SE slowed about 10 percent when the network wasincreased from 2 to 15 nodes, while an SE/30 or Mac II server was slowed byonly 1 to 2 percent.andP;  When downloading a 500K file, an SE/30 or II server wasslowed by about 5 percent when the network grew from 2 to 15 nodes, while theperformance of the Plus and SE were slowed by 11 and 8 percent, respectively.andM;The PC BluesandM;If you've recently replaced your IBM PC/AT with a Mac, you might be wonderingwhether you can use the cheaper PC as an AppleShare file server.andP;  The answeris yes -- you can purchase the necessary board and software -- but wewouldn't recommend it.andP;  We tested the FS100 PC File Server from DayStarDigital on the Compaq DeskPro 286, a popular AT clone.andP;  This setup produced aserver interface that looked exactly like AppleShare to a Mac user, but theserver's performance was far below that of even a Mac Plus.andM;The FS 100 server was nearly twice as slow as a Mac II on a network with tennodes, and 36 percent slower than a Mac Plus.andP;  The PC setup was four timesslower at the Database Read test than a Mac II, and it was almost twice asslow as a Plus.andP;  Using an IBM PC XT as an AppleShare server would produceeven worse results.andM;Even worse, the FS100 server crashed whenever we tried to do anything with 14Macs logged on to it.andP;  DayStar said that the server should support up to 30nodes -- if you add an extra line of information to the PC's Autoexec.batfile.andP;  This information wasn't in the manual at press time, although DayStarplans to include it in the next revision.andP;  However, the company said theextra line wouldn't improve the server's speed.andM;Who Needs Memory?andM;Finally, how much RAM should your file server have?andP;  As little as you can getaway with.andP;  We found little difference in performance between 1 and 5megabytes of RAM.andP;  AppleShare gets along fine with 1 megabyte; however, ifyou plan to run it concurrently with a spooler or E-mail, we recommend atleast 2 megabytes.andM;Choose Your PartnerandM;Overall, except for copying large files, a faster Mac-based file server doesmore to improve network speed than does adding Ethernet.andP;  And for a 15-nodenetwork, upgrading a file server is cheaper.andP;  An SE/300 lists for $4,998,which is less than $350 per nose.andP;  Ethernet, on the other hand, costs morethan $500 per node.andP;  So consider Ethernet only if you frequently transferlarge files between workstations.andP;  Our recommendation: upgrade your fileserver to an SE/30.andP;  It's the best way to make your small net work faster.andM;More TalkandM;Want to boost the speed of Local Talk without paying the price of Ethernet?andO;Then take a look at FlashBox or DaynaTALK, two new LocalTalk replacementsfrom the TOPS division of Sun Microsystems and Dayna Communications,respectively.andM;Each product consists of a hardware box, which sits between the Mac's network(printer) port and the LocalTalk wiring or PhoneNET box, and software thatgoes into the System folder.andP;  Both are designed to transmit network data atspeeds between those of LocalTalk and Ethernet.andP;  FlashBox's maximum data rateis 770,000 bits per second (bps) -- almost three times that ofLocalTalk--while Dayn-TALK zips along at 850,000 bps.andM;FlashTalk, the communications protocol used by FlashBox, has actually beenused in TOPS' PC boards for several years.andP;  Before FlashBox arrived on theMac, PCs on a TOPS network could talk with each other at FlashTalk speeds,but PCs could talk to Macs only at standard AppleTalk speeds.andM;Both FlashBox and DaynaTALK were expected to ship by March and to cost $189per node, while Ethernet costs upward of $500 per node.andP;  Besides beingcheaper than Ethernet, the new boxes let you spread out the cost by upgradingone node at a time, since they can still communicate with Macs that don'thave a box attached.andM;As our LocalTalk/Ethernet tests demonstrated, FlashBox and DaynaTALK willprobably be most useful on networks that frequently transfer large files.andO;We'll have a full report in a future issue.andM;GlossaryandM;AFP -- AppleTalk Filing Protocol, the part of AppleTalk that controls howusers share files over a network.andP;  It handles access privileges and managesfile- and record-locking.andP;  AFP is the standard network file system supportedby Apple.andM;AppleShare -- On the server side, Apple's Macintosh-only implementation of adedicated AFP file server.andP;

 Theresults don't represent peak traffic, such as 15 people trying to download a1-megabyte file at the same time; instead, they reflect the average networkperformance for a typical work group.andM;The same set of benchmarks was used to test two things: communicationscircuitry and file servers.andP;  For our comparisons of LocalTalk and Ethernet,we used the same server (an SE running AppleShare) for all tests.andP;  Whentesting servers, we always used LocalTalk circuitry and AppleShare software.andM;Setting UpandM;The testing for this Labs report was conducted in MacUser's new NetWorkShop.andO;We used 15 actual Macs for all the tests, rather than simulating extra nodeson a smaller number of machines by increasing the traffic per node.andP;  Our testwork group consisted of Mac Pluses, SEs, IIs, a IIx, and an SE/30, eachrunning the latest version of the System and operating from a variety offixed and removable hard disks and floppies.andP;  For the tests of LocalTalk andfile servers, we used Farallon's PhoneNET cabling.andP;  For our Ethernet testing,we used &quot;thin&quot; Ethernet cabling (RG58) with BNC connectors, Ethernet cardsfrom Dove and Kinetics for the SEs and IIs, and Kinetics' EtherSC boxes forthe Pluses.andM;To determine the amount of traffic a typical Mac workstation generates, wemonitored the traffic on MacUser's office network using Farallon'sTrafficWatch.andP;  The MacUser editiorial network is a busy one, with around 40users accessing server-resident databases, transferring files, sendingE-mail, and printing to the LaserWriters.andP;  We found that about three packets(bursts of data) per second were generated from each Mac that was in use.andO;However, these  measurements included Macs left idle while users attendedmeetings and such, so we increased our test work group's traffic flow to 4.5packets per second per Mac to ensure that we were pushing the mean.andM;In creating network traffic, we didn't want each node to send out a constantstream of data.andP;  That's not how people use a network.andP;  Typically usersdownload a file from the server, then work on a file on their local harddisk, then send an E-mail message.andP;  Thus we needed to generate traffic inspurts separated by periods of inactivity.andP;  Each node needed to be on adifferent &quot;spurt schedule&quot; to add the randomness seen on real networks.andO;Furthermore, the traffic  generator needed to be a real application so thepackets would be a realistic length.andM;To accomplish all this, we used a multiuser 4th Dimension database writtenespecially for us by ACIUS.andP;  The database was placed on a server where itcould be accesses by each node that had a copy of the 4th Dimension program.andO;Each node was set to read the database at a different interval between 25 and39 seconds.andP;  These numbers were adjusted to give an overall traffic rate of4.5 packets per second per node.andP;  Just as in an actual network with real fileservers, from time to time several nodes were requesting informationsimultaneously.andM;While most of the nodes were busy creating traffic, the benchmark tests weredone between one node and one server.andP;  For the file-server tests, all nodeswere logged on to the server being evaluated.andP;  For our comparisons ofLocalTalk and Ethernet, we used two servers: One was the &quot;real&quot; serverhandling the traffic flow, and  the other performed the benchmarkmeasurements.andP;  This ensured that the tests measured only network traffic, notserver traffic.andM;The BenchmarksandM;We developed four benchmark tests to represent the different types of tasksperformed in a work group.andP;  All measurements were taken four times and thenaveraged.andP;  The results for a given test were fairly consistent and did notvary by more than two or three seconds.andM;Printing test.andP;  We discovered that the amount ot time required for a Mac onthe network to print to a laser printer mainly depended on the printer anddidn't vary much under any of the conditions.andP;  Consequently we did not graphthese results.andM;4th Dimension Read (version 1.06) test.andP;  We measured the time it took aworkstation Mac to read a 4th Dimension database on the server and display ascreen listing 53 records.andP;  This test was illustrative not only of multiuserdatabases but also of E-mail servers, which can work similarly.andP;  Some E-mailservers receive a request from a workstation (a user opening a message, forexample), look through a database of E-mail messages, and send the message tothe user.andP;  This task gave the servers a good workout and turned out to  bemore dependent on the server than on whether we used LocalTalk or Ethernet.andM;Excel Launch (version 1.5) test.andP;  We clocked how long it took a Mac to openExcel on the server and display an 86K (25 rows andamp; 103 columns) spreadsheetfile.andP;  This task proved to depend equally on the file server and on thenetwork's communications circuitry.andM;File Download test.andP;  The final test was to download a 500K PageMaker filefrom the server.andP;  This was the most circuitry-intensive task and one whereEthernet proved to be the most valuable.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
