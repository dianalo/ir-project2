<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-47-0286 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method for the conversion of methanol is described comprising: contactingmethanol in the presence of a hydrogen cofeed with a catalytically effectiveamount of a crystalline aluminosilicate composition under conversionconditions effective to provide C/sub 2/-C/sub 4/ hydrocarbons at a selectivityof at least 50%. The conversion conditions comprise a temperature of325{sup 0}-500{sup 0}C and a pressure of 50-1000 psig and the crystallinealuminosilicate composition being prepared by a method which comprises:(a) contacting a crystalline aluminosilicate with a Group VIII metalsalt solution to incorporate about 0.2 to about 5% by weight of the metalonto the crystalline sluminosilicate, the Group VIII metal being platinum,palladium or ruthenium and the crystalline aluminosilicate being ZSM-5,zeolite lY or mordenite; (b) calcining the Group VIII metal crystallinealuminosilicate in air at a temperature of about 300{sup 0}C. to about600{sup 0}C. for at least 4 hours; (c) heating the calcined Group VIIImetal crystalline aluminosilicate in the presence of hydrogen from ambienttemperature to an elevated temperature of about 300{sup 0}C. to about500{sup 0}C. at a rate of temperature increase of about 0.5{sup 0} toabout 2.0{sup 0}C. per minute; (d) maintaining the crystalline aluminosilicateat the temperature for about 0.75 to about 1.25 hour; and (e) coolingthe crystalline aluminosilicate to ambient temperature in the presenceof hydrogen.</TEXT></DOC>
