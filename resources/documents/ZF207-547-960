 EXTRA!andP;  Houston Chronicle Corrals Unix!andM;Would a bunch of big-city journalists and newspaper workers happily chucktheir familiar old IBM PC XTs and DOs for workstations and Unix?andP;  No problem,said information systems managers at the Houston Chronicle, which recentlyscrapped its outdated micros for a centralized, Sun workstation servernetworking system running Unix office automation software.andM;Frustration with crashing PC hard disks gave the Texas newspaper the impetusto make a wholesale architecture switch, which in turn required a new set ofsoftware tools.andM;The Chronicle settled on Uniplex Business Software, an office automationpackage from Uniplex of Irving, Texas.andP;  The decision rested as much on thehardware and operating system already chosen as it did on the software thatwas available.andM;In choosing the hardware first and the software second, the Chronicle'sinformation systems department violated the frequently cited advice ofcomputer experts, who say software should be the guiding light in suchdecisions.andM;But the Chronicle's experts think the reverse method paid off.andP;  With someusers already on the X windows version of Uniplex, which was released lastmonth, the Chronicle's decision makers said they are satisfied they will beset for the foreseeable future.andM;Crashing Heads, Big HeadachesandM;Last year, hard disks started crashing with uncomfortable frequency on theHouston Chronicle's 150 aging IBM PC XTs, causing a substantial increase inmaintenance costs and, more seriously, destroying users' data.andP;  Thesix-year-old PC XTs &quot;were falling apart,&quot; said Jerry McEachern, manager ofoperations analysis and planning.andM;&quot;That means unhappy users,&quot; added Susan Shows, the Chronicle's director ofinformation and technology resources.andP;  &quot;We knew we had to replace [the XTs].&quot;andM;Some IBM PC AT micros had already begun creeping in as replacements for theXTs, but Shows was not sure that systems built on Intel's aging 80286architecture represented the wave of the future--at least not the Chronicle'sfuture.andP;  When the decision to replace the XTs was made, the Chronicle was inthe midst of companywide information technology upgrades.andM;To Shows and the other staff members who spearheaded the Chronicle'simplementation of new information technology, the writing on the monitor wasclear.andP;  PC technology and software were on the way out.andP;  Workstations, Unixand windowing were on the way in.andM;From the beginning, the newspaper discarded the recommended method ofselecting software first and hardware second.andP;  &quot;Hardware came first,&quot; Showsexplained, because whatever software eventually ran on the system, thedemands placed on the company's network would be high.andM;In the production department, the move was on to install a state-of-the-artpagination system.andP;  The plan was to eventually tie advertising and businesssystems together to streamline ad placement and billing.andM;The pagination system would clearly require a network with bandwidth aplenty.andO;&quot;We built this network with a broad badnwidth because with the paginationsystem, there is a high use of graphics,&quot; Shows said.andM;The graphics are required to build fullpage and other display ads, she said,adding that the classified ads, editorial production and photo darkroomfunctions would also be handled by the pagination system.andM;&quot;Our classified and editorial system is seven years old,&quot; Shows added, &quot;andneeded to be replaced anyway.&quot;andM;The network the Chronicle installed included all of the bandwidth Shows andher staff thought the system would need.andP;  Four fiber-optic loops runthroughout the Chronicle's building, passing data at 50Mbits per second.andO;These loops are connected to Ethernet file server bridges, to which a varietyof terminals are connected via Ethernet.andM;The fiber-optic loops are linked to a 1GB-per-second UltraNet network.andP;  Thisnetwork is used to pass data among the company's eight file servers from SunMicrosystems.andP;  The newspaper's graphic scanning devices are also connected tothe backbone network because of the volume of data they generate.andM;Two of the file servers are Sun-3/280 workstations, providing 4-MIPS service.andO;The other six servers are Sun-4/280 Sparc RISC servers, with 10-MIPSprocessing power.andM;Even with the heavy demands of the pagination system, the network had room tocarry even more data.andP;  &quot;In order to do a good job with the network andpagination system, we did need some horsepower,&quot; McEachern said.andM;So instead of treating the dying XTs as a separate problem, the Chronicle'sinformation systems staff roped the XTs' replacements into the overall plan.andM;Shows cited several reasons for abandoning the personal computing ethic,beginning with the simple reason of size.andP;  With terminals, rather than PCs,she said, &quot;you could have a small footprint on your desk, and all of the dataresides on the file server.&quot;andM;But more importantly, the Sun-based system corralled a somewhat unruly usergroup, Shows said.andP;  She said one of the reasons the XTs' disk failures werehitting the company hard was that &quot;users rarely backed up their data.&quot;andM;With central file servers, the information systems department could maintainbackup standards for the entire company, not just those employees using themainframe or pagination system.andM;In addition, Shows said, with the network/terminal combination, &quot;we can havecontrol of what software is on the system.&quot;andM;The company's users, Shows said, had been increasingly bringing in softwarefrom outside the company--eighter obtained from spouses or friends orpurchased outside of corporate channels--&quot;but we were expected to supportit,&quot; she said.andM;Although the company had established standards for microcomputing, &quot;thestandards weren't followed,&quot; Shows said.andP;  &quot;We weren't strict about it andthey weren't followed.&quot;andP;  However, with server-based software, informationsystems could control the software in use, install upgrades easily and reducethe cost of supporting and maintaining the software.andM;Finally, McEachern said, they performed a cost-justification study comparingthe terminals with a new round of PC ATs.andP;  &quot;We took the cost of a 286 and allof the software it would take to get where we wanted,&quot; McEachern said, &quot;andwe tried to stay even with the cost of terminals.&quot;andM;&quot;When we got it all down, we came up with a cost ...andP;  that we were satisfiedwith,&quot; he said, adding that each workstation costs the company between $3,000and $4,000.andM;Shows and Jack Stanley, the Chronicle's vice president of operations, decidedthat the cost of replacing the XTs would come out of the overall paginationproject budget, McEachern said.andP;  &quot;We had already gone to Hearst [theChronicle's parent company] in 1988 and asked for the money for the project,&quot;he said.andP;  Hearst executives had approved about $500,000 for the entireupgrade, McEachern added.andM;Searching for SoftwareandM;Even though the terminal approach made fiscal sense, the Chronicle also hadto find software that would satisfy users accustomed to the newspaper's Lotus1-2-3 and other PC-based software.andM;Shows said the first problem was finding office automation software to run onUnix.andP;  &quot;At that point in time, no office automation software was available inUnix,&quot; only developers' promises of soon-to-be-released ports, she said.andM;As they searched more carefully, Shows and McEachern did find spreadsheetsand word processing systems that might meet the company's needs.andP;  But thetask of choosing among them fell largely to McEachern in his role as managerof operations analysis and planning.andM;That title doesn't really describe his job, McEachern said.andP;  He now worksprimarily within the Chronicle's information systems department.andP;  As one ofthe Chronicle's PC power users, McEachern said he gained a reputationthroughout the company as the man to call when users have a problem.andM;Because of McEachern's background, Shows and Stanley felt he would be theright person to select software to replace Lotus 1-2-3 and the variety ofword processors, desktop managers and other software used on the XTs.andM;&quot;Susan and Jack felt that if I liked the package, I could sell the users onit,&quot; McEachern said.andP;  &quot;I have a pretty good idea of what the users out thereneed.&quot;andM;&quot;We basically started in November of last year,c McEachern said.andP;  He addedthat he was not given, and did not develop, a shopping list of features orcapabilities that the software was required to meet.andM;&quot;I didn't have an official, formal list saying this is what the users arelooking for,&quot; he said, &quot;but I had one in my head.&quot;andM;His primary goal was to select a package as compatible with 1-2-3 as possibleto ease users' transition to the new system.andM;&quot;We have got some heavy, heavy Lotus users,&quot; he said.andM;McEachern said he looked at a number of packages, including 20/20 from AccessTechnology of Natick, Mass.; C-Calc and Q-Calc from Saturn Systems ofMinneapolis; and a package called Articon, which is sold by Sun.andM;Q-Calc, in particular, appealed to McEachern because of its strong similarityto Lotus, including the ability to share files and macros.andP;  &quot;It was a realtough decision to get away from Q-Calc,&quot; he said.andP;  But there were otherfactors that influenced the software selection as well.andM;Besides spreadsheets--a primary PC application at the Chronicle--users neededword processing and simple database management capabilities, according toShows.andP;  At the time, two Pc-based database management systems were in use onthe Chronicle's XTs.andM;Moreover, the newspaper also wanted a windowing environment.andP;  When the paperpurchased Uniplex, McEachern said it did not require X windows compatibility,but it did require at least an internal windowing capability.andM;These considerations led McEachern and Shows to consider Uniplex, whichcontinued to impress them upon closer examination, they said.andM;McEachern said he found several of Uniplex's features appealing.andP;  Thespreadsheet bears a strong similarity to Lotus, and some of the pull-downmenus appear exactly the same, he said.andM;Some of the package's other modules, such as the card file and acalendar/scheduling system, would also satisfy the needs of users accustomedto keeping much of their daily work on a personal computer, according toShows.andM;McEachern said Uniplex allows users to customize the package's applicationsby modifying a personal ASCII start-up file, adding: &quot;But I don't know that Iwant them to do that&quot; for another year or so.andM;Finally, there was also the need for the windowing capability that Uniplexprovided.andP;  &quot;In some areas, people need several windows to do things,&quot; Showssaid, so they could have a spreadsheet, text report and perhaps even amainframe link on the screen at the same time.andM;Shows estimated that only about 25 percent of the users need windowing.andM;She said she will limit the number of windows that a user can have open atany given time.andP;  &quot;You don't want somebody to get 15 windows up when theydon't need them,&quot; she said.andM;Uniplex originally featured a proprietary windowing system, and only recentlyannounced its X windows graphical interface for the Uniplex software.andP;  Thatupgrade is already in use at the Chronicle, where &quot;we had decided to buy acouple hundred X terminals a couple of months ago,&quot; McEachern said.andM;Now, he added, users who need full, interapplication X windows capabilitiescan get them.andP;  But even those using &quot;a really dumb VT220 terminal&quot; havewindowing available to them within Uniplex, McEachern said.andM;The Chronicle only recently began installing the new terminals and Uniplexsoftware, so they have no hard data to indicate the success or failure oftheir choices.andM;Shows said the Uniplex data manager seems a little weak, and the company mayadd another package to the system to cover that gap.andM;But there are indications that the new system will be a success, Shows andMcEachern said.andP;  The company started its implementation with the accountingdepartment, which Shows said would be the hardest user group to sell.andM;&quot;We figured if we could sell accounting on it, then the rest of the companywould be happy as well,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;They liked it.andP;  They don't have anymajor complaints.&quot;andM;The information systems department is using the software, and accountsreceivable has also been added to the list of Uniplex users, Shows added.andM;By the end of this year, Shows said she expects to have all 200 usersthroughout the Chronicle on-line.andP;  The newspaper has purchased a 512-terminalsite license from Uniplex.andM;With the Uniplex implementation, McEachern said, the company would alsoinclude an aspect that was neglected when the XTs came in the door--training.andM;McEachern expects to give Uniplex users four to five hours of training time,including two hours of introductory material and two hours of training on theuse of the spreadsheet and word processor.andM;This, he said, would help ensure an easy--and thereforesuccessful--transition to the new system.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
