<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-46-0688 </DOCNO><TEXT>K-shell X-ray ionization cross section from thin targets of P, S, Cl,K and Ca by proton impact in the energy range of 1.0-5.0 MeV are reportedusing a Si(Li) detector. Their experimental results are compared withprevious very scanty available data and with ECPSSR theory. Data forP are reported for the first time. Results for S, Cl, and K in this wideenergy range are also new data. Their results show very good agreementwith those of other authors and ECPSSR theory.</TEXT></DOC>
