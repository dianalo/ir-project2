The official Xinhua news agency carried the ministry statement.   It was in response to an amendment, proposed by Sen. RobertDole, R-Kan., and added to a State Department appropriations billthat was approved Wednesday by a vote of 97-0. The amendmentdeclares that China should halt its sale of ballistic missiles andother offensive weapons to nations in the Persian Gulf area andMiddle East immediately.   It also suggests the United States reassess its relations withChina if the arms sales are not stopped.   The Foreign Ministry statement said: ``China has always taken aprudent and responsible attitude toward arms sales. This amendment,which makes a big fuss about the so-called question of `armssales,' brings harm to Sino-U.S. Relations. The Chinese governmentis firmly opposed to it.''   U.S. officials have expressed concern about the sale of Chinesemissiles to Saudi Arabia and reported negotiations with Syria tosell short-range missiles now being developed. China has deniedplans to sell missiles to Syria.   Last year, U.S.-Chinese relations were strained by U.S.allegations that China had sold Silkworm anti-ship missiles toIran. China denied the claim.   The United States last fall temporarily froze a furtherrelaxation of regulations on high technology sales to China toprotest the alleged arms sales to Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
