The compromise proposal for a world climate fund was adoptedafter private consultations among delegates of nine industrial andThird World countries.   Mostafa K. Tolba, head of the U.N. Environment Program,adjourned the meeting Thursday to break a deadlock whether to havesuch a fund.   ``This is the decision in principle that I wanted,'' Tolba toldreporters.``What remains is more difficult, to make it concrete.''   Industrial countries objected to demands to a fund that theysaid could be expensive to set up and administer. Third Worldcountries wanted to ensure that assistance would not be drawn fromexisting aid programs.   Earlier, the conference called for a worldwide ban by the year2000 on chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which are used inrefrigeration, some plastics and insulation.   CFCs break down the ozone layer high above the earth thatfilters out ultraviolet radiation from the sun, increasing the riskof skin cancer and eye disease.   The delegates agreed that developing countries needed assistanceto replace the technologies and equipment they inherited from theindustrial countries.   Scientists said the threat of ozone depletion can be avertedonly if CFC emissions are stopped altogether.   The adopted resolution said the conference ``recognizes theurgent need to establish international financial and othermechanisms'' to help developing countries.   It set up an ``open-ended working group to develop modalitiesfor such mechanisms ... that do not exclude the possibility of aninternational fund.''   The working group is to report next year to a second follow-upconference of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which was the firsttreaty to establish controls on the production and use of CFCs.   U.S. delegation leader Eileen Claussen said she is satisfiedwith the funding resolution, which she said filled the ``obviousneed for some financing on an international level.   ``The paper is fine,'' said Ms. Claussen, deputy director of theEnvironmental Protection Agency. ``It was a good mood in theworking group. After all, we're all in this together trying to dothe same thing.''   Finland's Environment Minister Kaj Barlund, who championed theidea of a world climate fund, said the resolution was ``close towhat we wanted.''   But he acknowledged that the vague wording may make it difficultto get the fund working.   The compromise was worked out among delegation heads from theUnited States, Soviet Union, Japan, Mexico, China, Senegal, Tobago,Malaysia, and New Zealand.</TEXT></DOC>
