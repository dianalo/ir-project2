The 50-year-old deputy chairman will succeed Sir Peter Walters when he retires at age 59 in March. The naming of Mr. Horton, an unusually brash Briton who loves America, was expected.    BP already is the largest oil producer in America, but still &quot;needs a much bigger presence in the U.S.,&quot; says Bruce Lazier, an oil-industry analyst in New York for Prescott Ball, a Cleveland-based brokerage concern. &quot;That has to be the main strategic impetus of BP right now.&quot;    BP could spend up to $10 billion on a U.S. takeover, Mr. Lazier says, by financing it with a blend of debt and equity. Los Angeles-based Unocal Corp., with extensive refining and marketing activities on the West Coast, long has been seen as a possible acquisition target. Buying Unocal also could give BP a needed boost in its natural-gas reserves. Other takeover possibilities include Phillips Petroleum Co. of Bartlesville, Okla., and New York-based Amerada Hess Corp.    Last February, Mr. Horton ruled out any large American acquisitions until the company pared its heavy debt burden -- a process he then figured would take at least 18 months. But yesterday, his message had changed.    &quot;If the right opportunity presents itself, of course we wouldn't be constrained by what the absolute level of debt happens to be,&quot; Mr. Horton said in a telephone interview. &quot;I have several interesting ideas up my sleeve,&quot; he added, declining to speculate about specific targets or timing of any bid.    Mr. Horton emphasized that BP has a strong cash flow and has nearly completed efforts to shed operations not related to oil and gas. The oil giant currently has most of its coal assets and operations on the block in a sale that analysts estimate may fetch as much as $500 million.    BP's heavy involvement in the U.S. largely grew out of Sir Peter's 1986 ouster of independent management at Standard Oil Co. Sir Peter, chairman since 1981, installed Mr. Horton to run the Cleveland-based concern. A year later, BP paid $7.9 billion for the 45% of Standard Oil stock that it didn't already own. Mr. Horton then melded Standard with BP's other North American assets to form BP America Inc.    In the top job at BP, Mr. Horton likely will earn less than the roughly $1 million annual salary he collected while running Standard. He said he will earn close to #400,000 ($620,200) this year in salary and bonuses. Sir Peter's pay and bonuses totaled #514,558 last year.    BP won't limit its expansion efforts to the U.S., Mr. Horton noted. &quot;I hope the Far East will form a sizable part of that as well,&quot; he said. &quot;And I don't discount further rationalizations and swaps in Europe.&quot;    BP's U.S. asset swap last fall with Mobil Corp. &quot;could be an analogy&quot; for similar European swaps, Mr. Horton went on. BP gained a quick entry into the lucrative West Coast gasoline market by agreeing to buy a Mobil refinery and related assets for $152.5 million. In exchange, BP's Sohio Oil Co. unit gave Mobil 330 Sohio Oil-owned and leased service stations in Florida, Michigan and six Mid-Atlantic states and Northeastern states.    Depressed oil prices and BP's relatively high debt levels may crimp Mr. Horton's plans to enlarge the company's international presence, some analysts said. &quot;They would have to wait until they felt reasonably certain oil prices would stabilize at current levels,&quot; suggested John Toalster, an oil-industry analyst at London brokers Hoare Govett Ltd. In addition, Mr. Toalster questioned the wisdom of BP's new focus on its core oil-and-gas business, because that business &quot;seems to be having fairly modest growth -- mainly 1% to 2% per annum.&quot;    But analysts agree that BP should benefit from Mr. Horton's &quot;commando&quot; reputation for taking charge quickly and making bold changes. As head of BP's chemicals division in the early 1980s, he earned the nickname &quot;Horton the Hatchet&quot; for reversing losses by slashing 60% of the work force and closing 20 plants. As deputy chairman, he recently created Project 1990, a team of six top executives hunting ways to eliminate bureaucratic layers and shake up the corporate culture. They are &quot;looking at the {entire} mission of the company,&quot; Mr. Horton explained.    The possible upshot? BP could move into second place from a precarious third among world oil producers. &quot;I don't aspire to size for the sake of size,&quot; Mr. Horton said in an interview in February. &quot;I have no desire to end my career in a BP that's bigger than Shell and Exxon.&quot; Instead, he added, he wants to retire with BP the best-run and most profitable oil company.    The company said David Simon will succeed Mr. Horton as deputy chairman and retain his current post as a managing director. BP also said Ray Knowland, chief executive of BP Chemicals, will become a managing director in March. </TEXT></DOC>
