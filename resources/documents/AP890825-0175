The contract goes into effect Saturday for all 2,500 members ofthe National Association of Broadcast Employees and Techniciansexcept two people who make up a newswriters unit in Chicago. Unionofficials said something would be worked out soon with the twoholdouts.   The contract, which replaces one that expired March 31, providesa first-year ratification bonus ranging from 6.1 percent to 7percent. There are 3 percent raises in each of the second and thirdyears and a 4 percent increase in the fourth year.   ``The contract, although lacking in many areas, is considered bythe union as the best it could obtain under the presentcircumstances facing NABET and others in the broadcast industry,''said John Krieger, a union spokesman.   ``It was best to reach a settlement through considerablecompromise rather than through any confrontation as we did with NBCin the 17-week strike in 1987,'' Krieger said.   NABET represents engineers, camera workers, video tape editors,newswriters, makeup people, publicists, couriers and traffic andcommunication coordinators.   The contract covers units at Cap Cities-ABC radio and televisionnetwork operations and radio and television stations in New York,Los Angeles, Washington, San Francisco, Chicago and various newsbureaus.   The pressing issue was job security for radio engineers in an erawhen broadcast companies are needing their specialized, restrictedservices less and less.   Krieger said the company promised to move the endangered radioengineers into television if necessary.   The company said it got increased flexibility to overcome anumber of restrictive work rules, including rules that restrictedcertain jobs, such as turning microphones off and on, to engineers.   The company said the contract also gives it an enhanced abilityto acquire and originate live and taped sports, news andentertainment programing and broader and more flexible dailyemployment rights.   ``The new contract grants the company the relief we sought sincethe negotiations began six months ago, while providing the unionwith certain securities it sought,'' Jeffrey Ruthizer, the CapCities-ABC chief negotiator, said in a statement Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
