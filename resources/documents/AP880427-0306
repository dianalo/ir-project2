Six of the seven non-OPEC producers attending a widely watchedmeeting with cartel members offered to cut oil exports by 5 percentif OPEC did likewise. The stated goal was to push up prices to $18a barrel and keep them there.   Colombia was the lone holdout in the group of independent oilexporters.   The OPEC group neither endorsed nor rejected the proposal,saying it would present it to a meeting of the full Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries on Thursday.   Some analysts have said the plan, if accepted by OPEC andimplemented, probably would push OPEC oil prices up quickly fromtheir current level of $14 to $16 a barrel.   There was no immediate indication of how many OPEC members mightaccept the proposal. Asked by reporters if he liked it, OPECPresident Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria was noncommital, saying: ``It'sa good proposal in that it's a proposal we've never had before.''   Earlier, Lukman had called the proposal a ``good beginning'' forcooperation between major oil producers.   Iran, which was not involved in Wednesday's talks, declared itssupport for the plan, but officials from most other membercountries withheld direct comment.   Fernando Hiriart, the Mexican oil minister and unofficial leaderof the non-OPEC group, told reporters after a short meeting withthe six OPEC countries that he was ``very satisfied'' with theoutcome.   The non-OPEC countries won't be participating in Thursday's OPECconference.   The Vienna meeting marked the widest participation byindependent oil producers in direct talks with OPEC in the 28-yearhistory of the cartel.   OPEC has said repeatedly in recent years that all oil-producingcountries, including the United States and Soviet Union, must sharethe burden of controlling production if violent swings in oilprices are to be prevented.   In a joint statement, the OPEC and non-OPEC countries in Viennasaid their meeting was an important first step.   ``It constitutes the beginning of a new stage of cooperationbetween a large number of oil producing countries,'' the statementsaid. `The underlying assumption shared by all is that a stable oilmarket is the responsibility of all and consequently the burdenshould be shared.''   The statement said the independent producers believed that oilproduction restraint was needed to bring prices back up to OPEC'starget of $18 a barrel.   Missing from the statement was any indication that the six OPECcountries who participated in the meeting Wednesday favored furthercuts in the cartel's production as part of a price-stabilizing plan.   Iran, Algeria and Venezuela have said they want to negotiatecuts in OPEC production, but others, including Saudi Arabia,Nigeria and Indonesia, have been reluctant to commit themselves tothis.   The Saudi-led faction fears that any production cuts by OPECwould only be offset by increases in output by other nations thatare not cooperating with OPEC.   The seven non-OPEC countries involved in the talks were Mexico,China, Egypt, Angola, Oman, Malaysia and Colombia.   Brunei was invited but did not attend.   Kazempour Ardebili, deputy Iranian oil minister, said in aninterview that his government favored the plan presented by thenon-OPEC countries..   ``We accept the extent of the cut'' in exports, he said, addingthat Iran hoped additional non-OPEC countries, including Norway andthe Soviet Union, could be brought into the plan.   Ardebili also criticized Saudi Arabia's decision to breakdiplomatic relations with Tehran.   He said the move wasn't likely to interfere with the OPECdeliberations in Vienna, ``although it may have been intended tohave that effect.''   He also asserted that the United States was behind the Saudidecision, which was announced Tuesday, in order to justify agreater U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf, where Iranianand American forces have clashed.   The proposal to cut oil exports was presented to the OPECcommittee by Hiriart, the Mexican minister. He said afterward thatfor the non-OPEC group a 5 percent reduction would amount tocutting exports by 200,000 barrels a day.   A 5 percent cut in OPEC's oil exports would equal between700,000 and 800,000 barrels.</TEXT></DOC>
