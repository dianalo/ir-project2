As a result, Gearhart said it canceled a previously reported agreement to be acquired by Computalog Gearhart Ltd., a former unit. The Halliburton agreement also comes a day after Energy Service Co. of Houston said it planned to propose a complex, $258.8 million merger with Gearhart.    Halliburton, an oil-field services concern, said it plans to merge Gearhart's wireline logging business into its Welex division, a Gearhart competitor. Halliburton also intends to merge Gearhart's seismic services operations into its Geophysical Services Inc. unit. A 60% stake in Geophysical was acquired by Halliburton from Texas Instruments Inc. in December.    Officials at Halliburton, Gearhart and Ensco couldn't be reached for comment.    If approved by Gearhart's stockholders and cleared by regulators, the acquisition would be the latest in the wave of consolidation that is sweeping the oil patch since the decline in energy prices.    Under the accord, holders of Gearhart common and its 1986 and 1987 preferred stock will receive 0.03575 share of Halliburton common for each Gearhart share. About 1.47 million Halliburton shares will be issued for the exchange. Based on Halliburton's closing price yesterday of $31.675, the stock swap has an indicated value of about $46.6 million.    In addition, owners of Gearhart debt and other preferred stock will receive $230 million in cash. Also Halliburton will assume about $19 million of Gearhart's foreign debt.    As previously reported, Ensco, an oil-rig contractor controlled by investor Richard Rainwater, planned to offer $258.8 million for Gearhart. But Fort Worth, Texas-based Gearhart had said its earlier letter of intent with Computalog barred it from talking to any other suitors.    The original agreement with Computalog signed last November promised to end Gearhart's two-year effort to restructure its more than $400 million in debt.    Halliburton and Gearhart said they expect to complete the transaction by midyear.    The transaction was announced late last night after the market's close. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Halliburton closed up $1 and Gearhart was unchanged at $1.25. </TEXT></DOC>
