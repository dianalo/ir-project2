U.S. District Court Judge Norma Johnson issued the gag orderagainst Fred Westerman and his lawyer, Frank Mroz, after theirnames appeared in a magazine article about the ``continuity ofgovernment'' program, according to government sources.   The program is aimed at enabling the government to regroup inthe event of a nuclear attack. Westerman owns a small firm thatprovided security services related to the program to the FederalEmergency Management Agency.   A Senate committee investigator attempted to interview Westermanas a result of the article in U.S. News andamp; World Report, but wastold the judge's order extended to conversations with Congress,said the sources, who spoke Monday on condition of anonymity.Johnson issued the order a week ago today.   Westerman in March 1987 began alleging there were irregularitiesin the program, according to papers on file in the U.S. Court ofClaims. Westerman has since been made a target of theinvestigation, which he claims is an effort at retaliation.   Details of Westerman's allegations are contained in a federalcourt suit that was placed under seal early this year because ofthe highly classified nature of the project.   The project includes mobile communications systems andcommand-post bunkers around the country, according to the magazine.   After Johnson's gag order last week, a computerized docket sheetat the federal courthouse was altered, so that case now is entitledmerely ``Sealed v. Sealed.''   The docket previously had said that Westerman and his firm,Systems Evaluation Inc., are suing the Army, three federalagencies, a private corporation and an Army Corps of Engineersofficer who oversaw his contract.   U.S. News reported that the Pentagon, the Justice Department,the House Armed Services Committee and a federal grand jury arelooking into the continuity of government program.   The investigations reportedly focus on allegations thatcontracts were awarded improperly or that payments were made forwork not properly done, resulting in millions of dollars in coststhat may not be justified.   On Christmas Eve 1987, after Westerman continued to makeallegations to superiors, the Army told him that his contract wasnot being renewed despite earlier assurances that it would be,according to papers he filed in the U.S. Court of Claims. He sayshe is still owed $500,000 in unreimbursed costs.   Westerman, a retired major who spent 20 years as an Armycounterintelligence officer, took his allegations to the FBI, theJustice Department and the inspector general's office at theemergency management agency.   In January, two months after filing his case with the claimscourt, he was informed that his contract was the focus of acriminal investigation by the Justice Department for possiblefraud. He recently received a ``target'' letter from the U.S.attorney's office in Baltimore informing him he is the focus ofthat probe.   His claims court case is suspended pending the outcome of thecriminal investigation.   ``I think there are certain individuals in the government whoare using this process to ruin my client financially,'' Mroz saidMonday after a hearing on the claims court case.   Mroz said the individuals, whom he did not identify, areengaging in ``retribution ... in connection with certainallegations by my client about waste and fraud as well as theirattempted cover-up of their own wrongdoing in the operation of hiscontract.''   Army spokesman Lt. Col. John Chapla said regarding theallegations of irregularities in the secret program, ``theappropriate authorities within the Congress and the executivebranch review (the program) regularly.''</TEXT></DOC>
