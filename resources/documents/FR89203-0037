This regulation requires the Commonwealth of MassachusettsDepartment of Environmental Quality Engineering (DEQE) to determine andimpose RACT on all stationary sources with the potential to emit one hundredtons per year (TPY) or more of VOCs that are not already subject to RACTunder Massachusetts' regulations developed pursuant to the EPA ControlTechniques Guideline (CTG) documents. In a November 17, 1982 letter toEPA, the DEQE committed to submit each of the individual RACT determinationsto EPA for incorporation into the Massachusetts SIP. One November 9, 1983,EPA codified at 40 CFR 52.1123 that the DEQE must submit each RACT determinationmade under 310 CMR 7.18(17) to EPA as a SIP revision in order to incorporatethe limitations imposed on each non-CTG source into the SIP. EPA's rationalefor requiring the DEQE to submit each RACT determination as a single sourceSIP revision is that emission limits and reduction measures imposed byStates on existing stationary sources in nonattainment areas do not constituteRACT unless and until EPA approves them as RACT via federal rulemaking.The Monsanto Polymer Products Company (Monsanto) in Indian Orchard, Massachusettsis a one hundred TPY non-CTG VOC source subject to RACT under Massachusetts'Regulation 310 CMR 7.18(17). On February 4, 1988, EPA received a requestfrom the DEQE to parallel-process a proposed SIP revision imposing RACTon Monsanto's non-CTG processes. This revision includes the DEQE's proposedPlan Approval, dated December 23, 1987, issued under 310 CMR 7.18(17) toMonsanto.<ITAG tagnum="85">Description of the RACT Determination</ITAG>Monsanto primarily produces polymers and plastics at its Indian Orchardplant. Originally, Monsanto had eleven processes subject to RACT. Withthe shutdown of the Phenol/Formaldehyde Resins Process and the PolyvinylAlcohol Process, and the sale of the Polystyrene Resins Process, the IndianOrchard plant now has <T3>eight</T3> non-CTG processes that are subject to RACT requirementsunder 310 CMR 7.18(17):The Formaldehyde Process;The Polyvinyl Butyral Sheeting Process;The Polyvinyl Butyral-South Process;The Melamine and Urea/Formaldehyde Resins Process;The Polyvinyl Formal Process;The Polyvinyl Acetate Products Process;The Polyvinyl Acetate Multipolymer Solutions Process; andThe Polyvinyl Butyral-East Process.The proposed Plan Approval imposes requirements which the DEQE has determinedto constitute RACT for these eight processes in order to reduce VOC emissions.In the course of its technical RACT determination, the DEQE determinedthat Monsanto's control of VOC emissions for the Formaldehyde Process,the Polyvinyl Acetate Products Process, and the Polyvinyl Acetate MultipolymerSolutions Process already constituted RACT. A description of the VOC controlsfor these processes is contained in the Technical Support Document preparedon today's action. It is available at the EPA Regional Office listed inthe <T2>ADDRESSES </T2>section of this notice. For these <T3>three</T3> processes, the DEQE has imposed certain compliance/enforcementrequirements in the proposed Plan Approval to insure that the emissionsdo not exceed those RACT levels. For the remaining <T3>five</T3> processes, the DEQE has imposed specific RACT requirementson Monsanto. In addition, the DEQE has imposed a general Leak Detectionand Repair Program on Monsanto to control fugitive VOC emissions. Thisgeneral Leak Detection and Repair Program is applicable to the entire plantwith the exception of the Polyvinyl Butyral Sheeting Process and part ofthe Polyvinyl Butyral-East Process. These RACT measures and the resultingemission reductions are detailed below:<T3>Polyvinyl Butyral Sheeting Process:</T3> Through a process change,Monsanto phased out the use of toluene resulting in a seventeen TPY reduction.<T3>Polyvinyl Butyral-South Process: </T3>Monsanto installed: (a) mechanicalseals on the hydrolysis reactors resulting in a 30.0 TPY reduction, (b)a packed-tower scrubber on the dryer, resulting in a 165.1 TPY reduction,and (c) a chilled condensation system on eleven storage tanks, resultingin a 22.2 TPY reduction. <T3>Melamine and Urea/Formaldehyde Resins Process: </T3>Monsanto installeda packed-bed scrubber on one kettle used for ``spill over'' production,resulting in a 0.52 TPY reduction. <T3>Polyvinyl Formal Process: </T3>Monsanto redesigned the venting systemsfrom the soak tanks, resulting in a 23.9 TPY emission reduction.<T3>Polyvinyl Butyral-East Process: </T3>In an earlier version of the PlanApproval, dated April 29, 1986, the DEQE required Monsanto to meet a schedulefor the installation of a packed-tower scrubber on the dryer in order toachieve a 51.3 TPY VOC emission reduction. That Plan Approval also requiredMonsanto to meet a schedule for the implementation of an intensive LeakDetection and Repair Program on two process units, the Acetalization/Hydrolysisunit and the Wash Tank. This intensive Leak Detection and Repair Programis to insure that the engineering fixes (e.g. the installation of mechanicalseals on agitator shafts) imposed in the proposed Plan Approval achievea 96.6 TPY VOC emission reduction (a 56% reduction) as part of Monsanto'sRACT determination. This intensive Leak Detection and Repair Program isspecific to these two units of the Polyvinyl Butyral-East Process and shouldnot be confused with the general Leak Detection and Repair Program thatis being imposed on Monsanto's Indian Orchard facility including the remainderof the Polyvinyl Butyral-East Process.Monsanto did not comply with the schedule imposed in the April 29, 1986Plan Approval. Accordingly, the DEQE issued a Consent Agreement and Orderdated December 5, 1986 with a forty thousand dollar penalty to Monsanto.That Order required Monsanto to comply with all the provisions of the April29, 1986 Plan Approval for the Polyvinyl Butyral-East Process as soon aspractical but in no case later than April 30, 1987. Further, the Orderimposed additional requirements on the Polyvinyl Butyral-East Process whichincluded an increase in the monitoring frequency of the <T3>general </T3>Leak Detection and Repair Program from quarterly to monthly,and the installation of a chilled fluid condensation system by June 30,1987 on four slurry tanks (vents andplusmin;111P181, andplusmin;111P182, andplusmin;111P183,and andplusmin;111P184). The December 5, 1986 Order is part of the DEQE'sDecember 23, 1987 proposed Plan Approval which is the subject of today'saction. <T3>General Leak Detection and Repair Program: </T3>In addition to theprocess-specific intensive Leak Detection and Repair Program discussedin the previous paragraph, the DEQE has imposed a general Leak Detectionand Repair Program to control fugitive VOC emissions from Monsanto's IndianOrchard facility. The December 23, 1987 proposed Plan Approval states thatthe test methods and the recording/reporting requirements of that generalLeak Detection and Repair Program must meet the requirements of MassachusettsSIP Regulation 310 CMR 7.18(19), Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacture.The DEQE adopted Regulation 310 CMR 7.18(19) pursuant to EPA's CTG, <T3>Control of Volatile Organic Compound Leaks From Synthetic Organic Chemicaland Polymer Manufacturing Equipment </T3>(EPA-450/3-83-006). The generalLeak Detection and Repair Program applies to the entire plant except forthe part of the Polyvinyl Butyral-East Process where the process-specificintensive Leak Detection and Repair Program is imposed and the PolyvinylButyral Sheeting Process. The DEQE did not subject the Polyvinyl ButyralSheeting Process to the general Leak Detection and Repair Program becausethe only VOC utilized in this process is a heavy liquid as defined in 310CMR 7.18(19) and in the above referenced CTG. Processes utilizing onlyheavy liquids are not subject to quarterly monitoring requirements forleak detection under 310 CMR 7.18(19). Therefore, the DEQE has imposedthese requirements of the general Leak Detection and Repair Program forMonsanto, a non-CTG source, consistent with leak detection and repair programsrequired by 310 CMR 7.18(19) for CTG-subject sources. <T3>Process Shutdowns: </T3>In addition to the requirements imposed onthe five processes and the general Leak Detection and Repair Program asdiscussed above, the DEQE's proposed Plan Approval also includes the reductionsachieved by shutting down the Polyvinyl Alcohol Process as part of theRACT determination for the Indian Orchard facility. In the course of itstechnical RACT determination, the DEQE had found 5.8 pounds of VOC per100 pounds of product to be RACT for this process. Implementation of <T3>that </T3>RACT determination would have resulted in an emission reductionof 601 TPY. However, Monsanto shutdown this process in 1986. The DEQE'sDecember 23, 1987 proposed Plan Approval requires that the shutdown bepermanent, and the DEQE considers<T3> all </T3>of the emission reductions achieved by this shutdown to beRACT. This shutdown resulted in 827.2 TPY reduction. The Phenol/Formaldehyde Resins Process was shutdown in 1984. The DEQE didnot quantify the resulting emission reductions and did not count them towardthe percent reduction achieved by its RACT determination. The DEQE doesconsider the 1984 shutdown of this process to be permanent and enforceable.Should Monsanto opt to restart this process, it would be subject to theMassachusetts SIP's new source review regulation located at 310 CMR 7.02.<ITAG tagnum="85">EPA's Evaluation of the RACT Determination</ITAG>As a result of VOC emission reduction measures imposed on Monsanto's activeprocesses and the shutdown of the Polyvinyl Alcohol Process, Monsanto'sIndian Orchard facility has achieved a plantwide emission reduction ofapproximately 76% (a 1222.8 TPY reduction), comparing 1985 emission levelswith emission levels after RACT. The year 1985 was used as the baselineyear to determine the percent reduction achieved by imposing RACT ratherthan the 1980 baseline year of the SIP. In 1985, Monsanto conducted anextensive refinement of its annual Source Registration Database. EPA andthe DEQE determined that use of the 1985 update to calculate Monsanto'spre-RACT VOC emissions provided for a more accurate comparison to post-RACTemissions than the use of the baseline year of the 1982 SIP. This 76% reductionin VOC emissions does not include the reductions in fugitive emissionsachieved by Monsanto's general Leak Detection and Repair Program to controlfugitive VOC emissions. As previously stated, this 76% reduction in VOCemissions does not include the reductions achieved in 1984 by the shutdownof the Phenol/Formaldehyde Resins Process. Most importantly, this 76% reductionis greater than the reduction projected for Monsanto in the <T3>Massachusetts 1982 State Implementation Plan for Ozone and Carbon Monxide;August 1982. </T3>EPA has reviewed the proposed Plan Approval and supporting documents submittedas a SIP revision and generally coucurs with the DEQE's RACT determination.For more details on EPA's evaluation of the DEQE's RACT determination andthe baseline used to calculate the RACT percent reduction, please referto the Technical Support Document available at the EPA Regional Officelisted in the <T2>ADDRESSES </T2>section of this notice. For Monsanto's eight processes that are subject to 310 CMR 7.18(17), theDEQE's proposed Plan Approval sets forth compliance/enforcement requirement.The purpose of these requirements, as specified in the December 23, 1987proposed Plan Approval, is to insure that Monsanto is meeting each RACTrequirement on a continuous basis.However, EPA finds that several of the RACT requirements, as currentlywritten in the proposed Plan Approval, are not clearly enforceable. Therefore,EPA and the DEQE cannot insure that the RACT emission reductions will actuallyoccur. Before EPA will conduct final rulemaking approving this SIP revision, theDEQE must add the requirements listed below to Monsanto's Plan Approvalto remedy these enforceability problems: Formaldehyde Process1. The final Plan Approval must require Monsanto to operate the chilledcondensation system such that the vented exhaust is at a temperature of40 degrees F or less, and install and maintain indicators to monitor complianceon a continuous basis. 2. The final Plan Approval must specifically require boiler No. 6 to bein a concurrent operation, i.e., in a firing mode, whenever the absorbersare in operation because their process off-gas is ducted and directed toboiler No. 6 for destruction. 3. The final Plan Approval must specify a percent removal efficiency forthe scrubber used for tank truck loading. This specific percent removalefficiency should be written into the final Plan Approval such that itis met whenever the scrubber is in operation.Polyvinyl Butyral Sheeting Process      For the printing process step, the Plan Approval's current language, ``pressnot used'', is unclear and does not appear to impose a duty on Monsantoand therefore is not legally enforceable. Consequently, the language shouldbe revised to read ``the rotogravure printing press shall not be used atany time.''Polyvinyl Butyral-South Process      1. The final Plan Approval must indicate a <T3>correct</T3> number of reactor agitators on the four hydrolysis reactorsfor which RACT has been defined as a Leak Detection and Repair Program(covered under Monsanto's general Leak Detection and Repair Program).     2. The final Plan Approval must specify the reduction efficiency to thepacked-tower scrubber installed on the dryer as a continuous requirement(i.e., Monsanto shall operate the scrubber at a removal efficiency of atleast 85.0 percent at all times).      3. The proposed Plan Approved contains a provision for the chilled condensationsystem installed on the solvent recovery process unit which reads ``thatMonsanto operate the chilled condensation system regardless of the outsideambient temperature unless Monsanto can demonstrate to the Department thatoperation results in no significant VOC reductions compared to non-operation.''The final Plan Approval should specify the size of the ``significant''VOC reduction for the purposes of comparing the operation of the systemwith the shutdown of the system. The formal SIP revision submittal fromthe DEQE to EPA should describe the procedure by which the DEQE would authorizethe system shutdown and issue an amended Plan Approval to Monsanto. Inaddition, the final Plan Approval must state the chilled fluid temperatureas an enforceable operating parameter (i.e., Monsanto must maintain thetemperature of the chilled fluid supplying the chilled condensers at 40degrees F or less at all times).Melamine and Urea/Formaldehyde Resins Process      The final Plan Approval must define the specific overall reduction efficiencythat must be continuously met for the two-stage scrubbing system, i.e.,venturi scrubber and packed-tower scrubber, for this process. In addition,the final Plan Approval should clarify that a ``no flow'' condition ofthe induced draft fan for the packed-tower scrubber must sound an alarmin the control room.Polyvinyl Acetate Products Process      The DEQE imposed an operating restriction of 750 hours per year on the75 gallon dissolving tank which is used to make Polyvinyl Butyral-Eastwindshield grade products. This operating restriction, as written in theDecember 23, 1987 proposed Plan Approval, is not considered enforceablein practice by EPA. If compliance with the operating restriction is basedon the total annual operating hours, there may be considerable time lagbefore a violation can be determined and documented as a continuing violation.Therefore, the final Plan Approval must require Monsanto to comply withthe annual 750 hour/year cap on a rolling monthly basis for any twelveconsecutive months. In addition, an effective date must be specified inthe final Plan Approval for this operating restriction of no later thanDecember 31, 1986.Polyvinyl Butyral-East Process      1. The final Plan Approval must specify the reduction efficiency for thepacked-tower scrubber installed on the dryer as a continuous requirement(i.e. ``Monsanto shall operate the scrubber at a removal efficiency ofat least 90% at all times).      2. The final Plan Approval must require Monsanto to install and maintainindicators to monitor that the vented exhaust temperature of the chilledcondensation system does not exceed 40 degrees F. In addition, the finalPlan Approval must state the chilled fluid temperature as an enforceableoperating parameter (i.e. ``Monsanto must maintain the temperature of thechilled fluid supplying the chilled condensers at 40 degrees F or lessat all times.'').      3. The December 23, 1987 proposed Plan Approval imposes a process-specificintensive Leak Detection and Repair Program on the Acetilization/Hydrolysisand Wash Tank process units of the Polyvinyl Butyral-East Process. As previouslystated, this intensive Leak Detection and Repair Program is to insure thatthe engineering fixes (e.g. installation of mechanical seals on agitatorshafts) achieve the 56% RACT reduction in fugitive VOC emissions from thesesubject process units. The fugitive VOC emissions from the Acetilization/Hydrolysisand Wash Tank process unit areas are exhausted via elephant trunks to ventNo. 820 and vent No. 821 respectively. The DEQE's December 23, 1987 proposedPlan Approval states that Monsanto will demonstrate that the 56% RACT reductionin VOC emissions has occurred by monitoring the exhaust from vent No. 820and vent No. 821 <T3>daily </T3>with an organic vapor analyzer (OVA). Further, that proposedPlan Approval states that compliance would be based on the quarterly averageof all readings. The DEQE proposes that quarterly averaged OVA readingof 35 parts per million (ppm) for the vent No. 820 and 23 ppm for ventNo. 821 would represent compliance with RACT.However, EPA does not concur that compliance with RACT for these two processesunits should be determined solely by monitoring vents No. 820 and 821.The proposed Plan Approval must be amended to subject all of the engineeringfixes and process modifications which achieve the 56% reduction in fugitiveVOC emissions to the intensive Leak Detection and Repair Program. The finalPlan Approval must require Monsanto to monitor each of these fugitive VOCemission points (e.g. agitator shafts, manhole covers, sampling points,etc.) of the Acetilization/Hydrolysis and Wash Tank process units. Further,the final Plan Approval must specify a frequency for conducting such monitoring.In no event may the monitoring frequency be less than on a quarterly basis.4. The DEQE's December 5, 1986 Consent Agreement and Order (which is partof the December 23, 1987 proposed Plan Approval) also requires Monsantoto conduct its<T3> general</T3> Leak Detection and Repair Program, applicable to theremainder of the Polyvinyl Butyral-East Process, on a monthly basis insteadof on a quarterly basis beginning on January 1, 1987 until such time thatMonsanto can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the DEQE that a less frequentinterval provides equivalent VOC emission reduction. The formal SIP revisionsubmitted by the DEQE to EPA should describe the procedure by which theDEQE would authorize a change in intervals for leak checks and issue anamended Plan Approval.5. With regard to the chilled fluid condensation system installed on thefour slurry tanks as required by the December 5, 1986 Consent Agreementand Order, the final Plan Approval must require that Monsanto: (a) maintainthe temperature of the vented exhaust at or below a specified temperaturein accordance with the design efficiency of the control system; and (b)monitor and record the temperature of the vented exhaust stream or setup an alram and recording system similar to the one Monsanto has alreadyimplemented for its control equipment (i.e., scrubbers and chilled condensationsystems). If the alarm and recording system approach is taken, the finalPlan Approval must require that this system be designed so that the alarmwill sound in the process control room if the temperature of the chilledfluid supplying the condensers exceeds a<T3> specified</T3> value.General Leak Detection and Repair ProgramThe DEQE's December 23, 1987 proposed Plan Approval contains a footnoteregarding the general Leak Detection and Repair Program which reads ``Intervalssubject to change based upon Department review of leak checking and repairdata gathered by Monsanto.'' The formal SIP revision submitted by the DEQEto EPA should describe the procedure by which the DEQE would authorizea change in intervals for leak checks and issue an amended plan approval.Compliance ScheduleThe DEQE's December 23, 1987 proposed Plan Approval does not specify finalcompliance dates for the RACT requirements for Monsanto's FormaldehydeProcess, Polyvinyl Butyral Sheeting Process, and Polyvinyl Acetate ProductsProcess. The final Plan Approval must specify final compliance dates ofno later than December 31, 1986 for all RACT requirements for these processes.MiscellaneousThe December 23, 1987 proposed Plan Approval interchangeably uses commercialnames as well as trade names for Monsanto's non-CTG processes. The finalPlan Approval should specifically state the trade name that correspondsto each commercial name for Monsanto's non-CTG processes.EPA is soliciting public comments on issues discussed in this notice. Thesecomments will be considered before taking final action. Interested partiesmay participate in the Federal rulemaking procedure by submitting writtencomments to the address above.This revision is being proposed under a procedure called ``parallel processing''(47 FR 27073). If the proposed revision is substantially changed, in areasother than those required in this notice, EPA will evaluate those changesand may publish a revised NPR. If no substantial changes are made otherthan those areas cited in this notice, EPA will publish a Final RulemakingNotice on the revision. Final rulemaking action by EPA will occur aftera final Plan Approval for Monsanto has been issued by the DEQE and hasbeen formally submitted to EPA for incorporation into the SIP.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action</ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve Commonwealth of Massachusetts' proposed PlanApproval dated December 23, 1987 as a revision to the Massachusetts SIPFinal EPA approval is contingent upon the DEQE amending that proposed PlanApproval as outlined in this notice prior to its formal submittal to EPAfor incoporatin into the SIP.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709.)The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof Section 3 of Executive Order 12291.The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove the SIP revisionwill be based on whether it meets the requirements of sections 110(a)(2)(A)-(k)and 110(a)(3) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA regulations in40 CFR Part 51.<ITAG tagnum="85">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Ozone, Hydrocarbons, Intergovernmental relations,Reporting and recordkeeping requirementss.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: July 5, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Micael R.
