LIM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hundreds of people jeered and tauntedthe younger brother of former President Chun Doo-hwan today as hewent on trial on charges of embezzling millions of dollars.   Prosecutors questioned Chun Kyung-hwan, 46, about allegations hehad amassed a fortune by using government and family connections ashead of the semi-official Saemaul Undong development group duringhis brother's administration.   The opening session was marked by boos and taunts as Chunconsistently denied prosecution charges. Abut 400 people inside thecrowded courtroom shouted ``Punish Chun'' as hundreds of policestood guard outside.   The younger Chun was arrested March 31 and accused of peddlinginfluence and embezzling about $10 million in Saemaul funds,investing them in real estate and private business.   Also on trial were 12 other people, including Saemaul officialsand the younger Chun's two brothers-in-law. They have been indictedon embezzlement, bribery and other charges.   Chun and most other defendants denied charges of divertingmillions of dollars to invest in real estate, contending the moneywas spent only for Saemaul development projects.   But some of Chun's aides acknowledged government charges andsaid Chun sanctioned embezzlement and tax evasion. If convicted, hecould face a prison sentence or the death penalty in the mostextreme case.   The opposition has demanded parliamentary questioning aboutwrongoings under the former president, who left office in Februaryat the end of a seven-year term.   Today, three opposition party leaders, including Kim Dae-jung,issued a joint statement that accused President Roh Tae-woo withtrying to protect his predecessor.   ``We demand pesident Roh take a clear attitude as liquidator ofwrongdoings under the former administration,'' the statement said.   President Roh accepted a cabinet decision July 14 to veto twoopposition-sponsored bills aimed at forcing the former president totestify in the National Assembly on corruption charges.   The bills, which have been returned to the legislature, wouldlikely be killed as the opposition lacks a two-thirds majorityrequired to override a presidential veto. The opposition controls acombined 166 seats in the 299-member assembly.</TEXT></DOC>
