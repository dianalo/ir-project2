 In the story, heparades through town while his subjects praise his new wardrobe.andP;  Well, itseems the Emperor is at it again and this time he has a new database manager.andM;Extended Edition (EE) is IBM's superset of the OS/2 personal computeroperating system.andP;  Extended Edition 1.1 bundles an SQL-based Database Managerand a Communications Manager with the standard OS/2 features.andM;Bundling a database management system (DBMS) with an operating system, as IBMhas done, is not a new strategy.andP;  It was used with success in theminicomputer industry by Hewlett-Packard.andP;  Their IMAGE DBMS dominated the HP3000 market for many years because it was a robust product and because it wasperceived as being &quot;free&quot; by hardware purchasers.andP;  Now IBM is trying the samestrategy on personal computers and hoping for similar success.andM;Promises madeandM;Since announcing EE Database Manager two years ago, IBM has promised &quot;greaterconvenience in designing, creating and using a database&quot; and &quot;applicationportability across systems&quot; (IBM Operating System/2 Standard and ExtendedEditions, November 1987), as well as &quot;high levels of performance&quot; and&quot;distributed database management systems support&quot; (IBM Personal SystemsDeveloper, November 1988).andP;  The convenience and portability are attributed tothe much-publicized Systems Application Architecture (SAA).andP;  The distributedDBMS support is said to allow the personal computer user to accessinformation stored in large system DB2 and SQL/DS databases.andP;  These are hugepromises from the biggest company in the computer industry.andM;What is deliveredandM;Extended Edition Database Manager 1.1 bats 0 for 4 on IBM's promises.andP;  The&quot;greater convenience&quot; turns out to be a character-based user interface with aMacintosh-like menu system; it's not integrated with Presentation Manager andcan't be run in a window.andP;  Applications developed with the Database Manager4GL tools are not yet portable because the tools don't exist in other SAAsystem environments (for example, SQL/400 on mid-range AS/400 computers andDB2 on mainframes).andP;  High performance turns out to be approximately the sameas performance we already have with MS-DOS database managers (see theaccompanying article for details).andP;  And distributed database functions aren'timplemented in the first release.andP;  Despite the disappointing batting average,Extended Edition 1.1 does have some good points.andP;  In this article I'll lookat what is delivered.andM;The componentsandM;Database Manager is packaged in two parts: Database Services and QueryManager.andP;  Database Services is the back-end software that manages yourdatabase on disk.andP;  Query Manager is the front-end interface that helps youquery your database and build custom applications in a fourth-generationenvironment.andP;  For developers writing database application programs in C (theonly high level language supported), Query Manager isn't required.andP;  Your Cprograms can call directly to Database Services using embedded SQL, just asthey can in most other SQL DBMSs, and your applications can be ported toother SAA platforms.andP;  For developers who choose to work with 4GL tools andusers who want an interactive environment, Query Manager is the databaseinterface.andM;Documentation for Database Manager is small for a major DBMS product--roughlyhalf of an 8-inch by 9-inch ring-bound manual.andP;  It's well-organized with goodexamples, but peters out just when it gets to the interesting topic ofbuilding custom interfaces in Query Manager.andP;  This may indicate that QueryManager is inteded only for very simple applications, or it may be anoversight.andP;  The highlight of the documentation is hidden away in Appendix L:&quot;Database Manager--Designing Your Database.&quot;andP;  This short, pithy sectiondescribes entities, relationships, keys, and normalization in as close toplain English as I have ever seen.andP;  Bravo!andM;Information on C programming is bound separately in two programming familymanuals titled Database Manager Programming Guide and Reference and DatabaseManager SQL Reference.andP;  Appendix C of the SQL reference contains a lengthylist of &quot;Future Reserved Word Candidates,&quot; including the words: assertion,consistency, constraint, domain, foreign, key, primary, and trigger.andP;  Thesewords imply that IBM is giving consideration to adding integrity support tothe SQL language, which would be a welcome addition indeed.andM;Note: In case you're not familiar with the concept of integrity, perhaps aquote from C.J.andP;  Date in An Introduction To Database Systems, Volume I,Fourth Edition (Addison-Wesley 1986), would help explain: &quot;The term'integrity' refers to the accuracy or correctness of the data in thedatabase.andP;  Systems today are typically rather weak on integrity--mostintegrity checking today is still done by user-written procedural code.andP;  Itwould obviously be preferable to be able to specify integrity constraints insome more declarative fashion and thereby have the system do the checkinginstead.&quot;andM;InstallationandM;There are two menu-driven installation programs for Database Manager that arerun from the OS/2 command prompt: DSINST for Database Services and QMINST forQuery Manager.andP;  Both are extremely easy to use.andP;  The only actual work youhave to do, besides swapping disks when requested, is to decide on a uniqueuser I.D.andP;  and put it into the CONFIG.SYS file using System Editor.andP;  SystemEditor is a dramatic improvement over the infamous EDLIN found in MS-DOS.andM;Hardware and memory requirements (from the &quot;Getting Started&quot; booklet)include:andM;* An IBM PS/2 (Models 30 286, 50, 50Z, 60, 70, or 80), IBM PC/AT, or IBMPC/XT Model 286andM;* A 5.25-inch or 3.5-inch high-capacity disk driveandM;* A minimum of 3M of memoryandM;* A minimum of 20M of fixed disk storage spaceandM;Note: The 3M memory and 20M fixed-disk storage requirements listed areminimum amounts and may not support the hardware and software configurationrequirements for the particular OS/2 program functions you select.andP;  If youplan to use large databases, run multiple applications at the same time, orstore large numbers of files and programs, you may need to increase thesememory and storage requirements.andM;Also, the PS/2 Model 80 that IBM loaned me to test Database Manager cameequipped with 6M of memory.andP;  The packing list accompanying the hardware hadwritten on it &quot;at least 5M.&quot;andP;  This indicates to me that IBM considers 5M ofmemory a more realistic configuration than 3M for substantial database work.andM;Query ManagerandM;The first thing you'll see after starting Query Manager is the screen forcreating or opening a database.andP;  It pushes the bit-mapped window environmentof Presentation Manager out of the way and takes over the entire screen,placing a Macintosh-like menu bar with pull-down menus at the top.andP;  QueryManager menus can be used with either a mouse or from the keyboard, althoughkeyboard use requires a distressing number of keystrokes.andP;  For example, thekeyboard user can't hold down a key and press the first letter of a menu toselect it; two separate keystrokes are required.andP;  Keyboard shortcuts (afunction key or a shift/Ctrl-key combination) are available for many menuchoices, if you want to memorize them.andP;  In addition, Query Manager commands(textual equivalents of some of the menu choices) can be run from a &quot;CommandLine,&quot; so power users can avoid having to traverse the menu hierarchy to findthe right menu.andM;The Query Manager commands available from the command line are: BEGINWORK--defines the beginning of a transaction CANCEL WORK--cancels databasechanges made during a transaction END WORK--commits database changes madeduring a transaction ERASE--deletes a database object EXPORT--dumps data toan OS/2 file GET andless;variableandgt;--displays or assigns a Query Manager variableIMPORT--reads data from an OS/2 file PRINT--prints a database object or areport RUN--runs a database object SAVE DATA AS--saves the results of a querySET variable--sets a Query Manager variable to a valueandM;Once a database has been opened, there are seven different types of databaseobjects to choose from on the Main Selection screen:andM;1.andP;  Tables and ViewsandM;2.andP;  QueriesandM;3.andP;  FormsandM;4.andP;  ProceduresandM;5.andP;  PanelsandM;6.andP;  MenusandM;7.andP;  ProfilesandM;Database Manager uses the term &quot;objects&quot; to describe the kinds of data andsoftware created by the user, but it's not an &quot;object-oriented&quot; DBMS.andP;  (Datatypes are not extensible and there is no built-in support for graphics orsound.)andP;  Database Manager objects are all stored in the database, rather thanstrewn about in operating system files.andP;  Now let's look at the types ofobjects in more detail.andM;Database Manager tables and views (and indexes, which are lumped in thiscategory too) are similar to those found in other relational DBMSs.andP;  They canbe created with SQL DDL (Data Definition Language) or through menu choices.andO;Simple data entry and editing capabilities are also available through themenus in this section of Query Manager.andM;SQL: a pleasure to useandM;SQL queries can be typed directly to Query Manager, or you can enter promptedquery mode, where you're led through the steps of retrieving data withouthaving to know SQL syntax.andP;  Pops-up menus presenty you with the names of thecolumns and the available comparison operators.andP;  A simple prompted querylooks like this after it's built: Tables: STEVER.SPJ Columns: S# P# QTY RowConditions: If J# Is Equal to 'J320'andM;Prompted queries can be converted into the equivalent SQL text, but theycannot be converted back.andP;  Database Manager SQL contains two importantextensions to the SQL language: the set operators EXCEPT and INTERSECT.andM;EXCEPT is the relational difference operator; it returns all rows in thefirst table that are not in the second table (like MINUS in ORACLE).andP;  forexample, suppose you had a table of checks written in the last month and youwanted a list of all non-employees who had received checks: SELECT FIRSTNAME,LASTNAME FROM PAYMENTS EXCEPT SELECT FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME FROM EMPLOYEESandM;INTERSECT returns all rows in the first table that are also in the secondtable.andP;  For instance, the following are the SQL statements you'd use toobtain a list of all employees who had received checks: SELECT FIRSTNAME,LASTNAME FROM PAYMENTS INTERSECT SELECT FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME FROM EMPLOYEESandM;Neither of these examples can be done conveniently with a subquery, becausesubqueries work only on single-valued expressions (individual columns).andO;EXCEPT and INTERSECT are valuable extensions to the language, and I expectthey'll find their way into the ANSI standard.andP;  In general, Database ManagerSQL was a pleasure to use.andP;  It's a complete SQL implementation (unlike R:BASEfor DOS), and it works exactly as documented (unlike dBASE IV).andM;Other ways to get to the dataandM;Beyond tabular queries, you must learn to use the other Query Managerobjects: report forms (usually called &quot;reports&quot; in other DBMSs), panels(usually called &quot;forms&quot;), menus, and procedures.andM;Menus and report forms are constructed using a table-driven approach--youfill in a table to define the &quot;object.&quot;andP;  The appearance of a panel is definedby painting the screen with labels and fields; paenl actions are alsotable-driven.andM;Procedures are programs made up of Query Manager commands and procedurelanguage statements (such as DO WHILE, DO UNTIL, and IFF...THEN...ELSE).andO;Here's a simple procedure, shown in the manual, that conditionally prints aweekly or monthly sales report based on the value of a variable: if month ='NO' then do 'run query salesw' 'print report (form=sale)' end else do 'runquery salesm' 'print report (form-sales)' endandM;Note that Query Manager commands must be enclosed in apostrophes, whereasprocedure language statements must not.andP;  This makes procedures seem slightlyschizophrenic--as does the need to maintain separate pools of variables forQuery manager commands and procedure language statements and to shuttlevariable values back and forth between them.andM;Procedures can be run interactively, from menus, from panels, or from theOS/2 command prompt.andP;  (The latter method allows you to include procedures inbatch files by specifiying the procedure name in the OS/2 command line thatinvokes Query Manager.)andP;  Strangely, SQL commands can't be included inprocedures; they must be part of a query that's called by a procedure.andP;  Thismeans the database developer must work in three different language contexts:SQL, Query Manager commands, and procedure language statements.andM;Custom applications can be built by using menus and procedures to tietogether a series of panels, queries, and report forms.andM;In addition to the features I've already mentioned, there are also the usualdatabase utilities for fine-tuning a database, importing and exporting data,and backing up a database.andP;  The only utility I used during my testing wasImport.andP;  I used it to load information from comma-delimited ASCII data filesinto the database tables.andP;  Import was very easy to use, but the only fileformats it understands are IXF (Database Manager import-export format), DEL(delimited ASCII), WSF (worksheet), and ASC (non-delimited ASCII).andM;What if...andM;Imagine this scenario: the year is 1981 and IBM is introducing their firstpersonal computer.andP;  Bundled with the MS-DOS operating system is an attractiveprogram called Database Manager, which lets you create databases and writesimple applications easily.andP;  You say to yourself, &quot;This could really beuseful!&quot;andM;Now jump to the present and imagine what the PC database software industrywould look like if Database Manager had debuted seven years ago.andP;  Chancesare, it would have grabbed the lion's share of the market.andP;  We might neverhave heard of dBASE, R:BASE, or Paradox.andP;  The database programmer's job wouldbe safer but a little boring.andM;But what would have been an innovative product in 1981 is not quite soexciting now.andP;  Query Manager can't match the best of the existing PC databaseproducts in ease of use or in breadth of front-end tools.andP;  Dabase Manager'sperformance is not better than what is already on the market.andP;  And there areunanswered questions: Why isn't Query Manager integrated with PresentationManager?andP;  (It should be able to run in a window.).andP;  Will Query Managerapplications be portable to other IBM environments or will, they berestricted to personal computers?andP;  How long will users have to wait totransparently share information with other IBM platforms?andP;  The promises IBMhas made for this product have not yet been kept.andM;Should you make the switch?andM;It's hard to imagine why anyone who's already using a PC DBMS would give itup to use Extended Edition's Database Manager, at least at this point in itsdevelopment.andP;  The cost is daunting.andP;  Between $5,000 and $10,000 must be spenton hardware to provide a platform capable of obtaining reasonable performancefrom the software.andP;  As the timing tests presented in the accompanying articleshow, a fully configured PS/2 Model 80 running Database Manager is roughlyequivalent in speed to an AT clone (under $2,500 in hardware) running ORACLE.andM;People who need to link to their IBM large systems will find little realvalue in the current release of OS/2 Extended Edition.andP;  There are nodistributed database capabilities in Database Manager, although IBM hasannounced an extension to Database Services known as Remote Services as aplanned enhancement.andP;  It is possible to export information from an IBMmainframe database and import it into a Database Manager database, but thisis nothing new; the same can be done with non-IBM databases on either end ofthe export-import path.andP;  Furthermore, Query Manager applications arecurrently portable to other platforms.andP;  If users are willing to give up the4GL tools, database applications written in C and limited to standard SAAfeatures can be portable to other SAA environments (DB2 on an MVS system,SQL/DS on a VM system, or SQL/400 on an AS/400 system).andM;Most likely, the one-stop shopping approach of Extended Edition will appealto organizations installing OS/2 for new applications, particularly thosethat want some sort of  compatibility with other IBM off rings.andP;  These buyerswill be getting a relational DBMS with some strong points, but they ought toknow that it does not yet live up to its advance billing.andM;Remember the little boy who asked &quot;Why doesn't the Emperor have any clotheson?&quot;andP;  That's a question we have to ask when face with Extended Edition.andM;AvailabilityandM;OS/2 Extended Edition 1.1, including Database Manager, sells for $830.andP;  Foradditional information, contact IBM, 900 King Street, Rye Brook, New York10573, phone (800) 447-4700 or (201) 930-5231.andM;Steve Roti is the owner of Olympic Software, a database applicationsconsulting firm located in Portland, Oregon.andP;
