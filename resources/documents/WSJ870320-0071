Separately, James E. Edwards, an ATandamp;T senior vice president who preceded Mr. Cassoni as head of the computer division, said he is leaving the company, effective Monday.    According to managers in the computer, or Data Systems, division, ATandamp;T will announce new products that include an addition to its 3B minicomputer line, software products to connect its machines to those of International Business Machines Corp., a laser printer, the latest version of the Unix V operating system software and some local area network products.    None of the products are technologically significant but mainly catch up with competitors, ATandamp;T managers and consultants said. The announcements, to be made at ATandamp;T headquarters in three separate meetings with consultants, reporters and industry analysts, are meant to show that Mr. Cassoni and ATandamp;T are still serious about selling computers. The intent, ATandamp;T sources say, is to &quot;reassure customers unsettled by events of the past six months&quot; and &quot;convince customers who are still 'on the fence' that ATandamp;T is the right choice.&quot;    ATandamp;T's credibility in computers has plummeted as it has reshuffled management, posted pre-tax 1986 operating losses of $1.2 billion in the division, and appeared to be de-emphasizing computers in favor of long-distance phone service.    Product sales have been dismal recently; according to ATandamp;T sources, the company in January sold a mere 2,000 PC 6300 and 6300 Plus personal computers, its most successful machine, against a business plan of 120,000 for the year. Last year, sources say, the company took a $100 million write-off, in two steps, on its Unix PC, and stopped ordering the machine, resulting in layoffs and salary cuts at its maker, Convergent Technologies Inc., San Jose, Calif.    Several Data Systems executives have quit recently. John Walsh, a vice president in charge of the 3B minicomputer line, surprised colleagues in January when he left to join a small West Coast videoconferencing concern. And just yesterday Mr. Edwards said he is leaving to become president and chief executive officer of TelWatch Inc., a Boulder, Col., developer of systems to manage networks.    &quot;I've escaped,&quot; said Mr. Edwards. Telwatch &quot;had been working on me for the last 30 to 35 days to see if they could tempt me to leave Big Mama. I've always had the ambition to run my own company.&quot;    Though Mr. Cassoni has a tough job ahead of him, he is trying hard to reestablish ATandamp;T's credibility. He attended an important personal computer industry conference in Phoenix, Ariz., last month -- the first year that ATandamp;T has gone to that particular conference. &quot;Vittorio seemed a lot more interested in what the industry is doing&quot; than past ATandamp;T computer executives, said John Sculley, chairman of Apple Computer Inc.    Mr. Edwards, who cited a number of reasons for ATandamp;T's trouble in computers, also said he thought Mr. Cassoni's job will be made easier by his coming from Ing. C. Olivetti andamp; Co. of Italy, which has agreed to make and develop all ATandamp;T personal computers and workstations. He said he supported the decision made last October to replace him with Mr. Cassoni.    In Mr. Cassoni, &quot;you aren't bringing in just another outsider. You are listening to a strategic partner,&quot; Mr. Edwards said. Since Mr. Cassoni arrived, &quot;my observation is that the strategic relationship with Olivetti is working better,&quot; he said. ATandamp;T previously had disputes with Olivetti over transfer pricing and marketing strategy.    Industry consultants said Mr. Cassoni's approach thus far is to rank products in terms of profitability and cut those that aren't money makers. &quot;He is either going to make it profitable or they are going to get out of the business, and I figure he has two years to do it,&quot; said David Taylor, a program director at Gartner Group who left ATandamp;T's computer division last April.    But product managers also grumble that, because of directives from Mr. Cassoni's bosses, whose experience is in ATandamp;T's regulated long-distance business, expenses are being restricted so much that they can't adequately serve customers. According to some, each product manager is allowed only $3,000 a year for travel and entertainment. On that budget, product managers say, they can't determine what customers need, let alone sell them anything.    An ATandamp;T spokesman wouldn't comment on specifics, but said the company would spend what was necessary to sell products.    &quot;If they really restrict them to that, there is going to be a lot of time spent over the phone,&quot; said Mr. Taylor. &quot;They won't be able to hold people to that and get products out.&quot;    In addition, Mr. Cassoni is plagued by the same problem that hurt Mr. Edwards: He doesn't have his own sales force to sell computers, but has to rely on a sales force that also sells long distance service, modems, multiplexers, telephones and office switchboards.    One source said Mr. Cassoni's boss, Sam R. Willcoxon, president of the Business Markets Group, refused to give him his own sales force. Unless the company changes its mind, the source said, &quot;they are going to have a very, very hard time being successful in anything except long distance.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
