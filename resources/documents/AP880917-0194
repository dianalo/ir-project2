Gold prices continued to tumble Friday, shedding nearly $7 atroy ounce. The plunge brought the two-day decline in gold pricesto roughly $18 an ounce and left gold at its lowest point sinceMarch 1987.   Republic National Bank in New York quoted gold bullion at$411.75 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT.   Unlike stocks and bonds, gold does not provide dividends. Itsmain merit is it keeps its value when paper investments are erodedby inflation. But inflation has been lower than gold investors hadexpected.   ``These people are disappointed and shocked and adding fuel tothe fire,'' said Steven Pepper, vice president and bullion dealerat Republic National Bank. ``The more selling that comes in, themore these people are in a panic.''   In other markets Friday, stocks gained some ground and the DowJones average of 30 industrials rose 5.87 to 2,098.15. The dollarwas mixed and bonds drifted slightly lower in sluggish trading.   The government said Friday business inventories rose in July atthe slowest rate in 11 months, an indication sales were strongenough to keep goods from piling up on the shelves.   The Commerce Department said inventories rose 0.3 percent _ thesmallest rise since one of 0.2 percent in August 1987.   Economists believe businesses have been intentionally adding totheir inventories in a small way to have a buffer for continuedstrong sales.   Business sales fell 0.2 percent in July, but the decline was notconsidered worrisome because it followed a strong 1.4 percent jumpin June.   ``When you put June and July together, sales are still growingstrongly,'' said James Annable, chief economist of First NationalBank of Chicago.</TEXT></DOC>
