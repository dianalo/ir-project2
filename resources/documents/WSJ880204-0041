Voting </HL><SO> </SO><CO> ECH LABOR RAY </CO><IN> CON </IN><DATELINE> BRANFORD, Conn.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Echlin Inc. and a shareholder committee said that a lengthy count of votes cast at the annual meeting showed that resolutions submitted by a union-organized group were defeated, but that the margin remains in dispute.    The resolutions sought to have the company study health problems and legal liabilities tied to asbestos. Echlin is a major shareholder in Raytech, a Trumbull, Conn., company with a subsidiary named in thousands of asbestos-related liability lawsuits.    The union-backed group, which controls about 60,000 Echlin shares, also sought to suspend further Raytech share purchases by Echlin. The union-backed group said its proposal on health problems received 24% of the votes cast, while the company says it received 17.3%. And the committee said its Raytech stock purchase proposal received 22%, while the company says 15.9%.    Echlin calculates the percentage on the 44 million shares represented at the Dec. 22 meeting, while the union calculation excludes several million shares present but not voted on those resolutions. </TEXT></DOC>
