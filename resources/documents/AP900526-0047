SIMPSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TA' PINU, Malta (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pope John Paul II crossed the Maltesearchipelago today and urged the islanders to reject any challengesto the Roman Catholic Church's ban on abortion and other familyteachings.   On the second day of his pilgrimage here, the first ever by apope to Malta, John Paul kept up his theme of reminding the Malteseof their centuries-long Catholic traditions.   The Vatican says 98.9 percent of Malta's 350,000 people areCatholic. Abortion is illegal here, and courts do not grantdivorces.   John Paul crossed from Malta to Gozo, the second largest islandin the archipelago, on a 60-foot catamaran. The trip took him bySt. Paul's Bay, where Maltese say the apostle was shipwrecked inthe year 60 and founded the first Christian community on the island.   Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said John Paul stood on thebridge during the 18-minute trip across the blue Mediterraneanwaters, nearly calm except for an occasional whitecap.   Celebrating his first Mass on Malta at a 17th-century shrinededicated to the Virgin Mary, John Paul said that Maltese familiesmust guard against the challenge posed by rapid development.   ``Like many societies, yours is not immune to a kind ofspiritual disorientation caused by rapid social changes and theattraction of value systems and modes of behavior which run counterto the deepest convictions which have molded your identity as apeople,'' John Paul said, speaking in English.   He called on ``all those responsible for the public welfare'' toreject as harmful to society ``everything that would ignore or denyGod's plan for the family and lessen respect for the gift of humanlife,'' referring to abortion.   About 1,000 people jammed into the small square in front of thebasilica under a scorching sun for the Mass.   With a holiday spirit prevailing, cannons boomed a noisy salutewhen word reached this town that the pope had docked in Gozo.   Enthusiastic crowds rushed toward the white ``popemobile'' as itdrove toward the Mass site.   The visit comes after a long period of church-state tensionunder the previous Socialist government, which ruled from 1971until narrowly losing the general election in 1987.   The Socialist government barred private schools, includingCatholic ones, from charging tuition. It also ordered the church tohand over property it could not prove it owned.   New church-state accords are being worked out with the presentNationalist administration.   Since arriving in Malta on Friday afternoon, the pope has madeclear he expects the government to allow the church to play itshistoric leading role on the islands. The visit, the pope's 48thforeign tour, ends Sunday.</TEXT></DOC>
