(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Acme Boot's elephant-skin boots willvanish from stores by mid-summer as production of the $200-a-pairfootwear ceases because of possible poaching in Africa.   Acme, the world's largest boot manufacturer, dropped the line ofcasual boots this week after several years of production. The60-year-old company continues to make footwear from the skins ofexotic creatures including the ostrich, snake, lizard, alligatorand eel.   Acme, based in Clarksville, Tenn., said its purchases of Africanelephant hides, made through an importer, were legal. But specialinterest groups had questioned the treatment of elephants by others.   ``We have seen increased concern by environmentalists andconsumer groups about illegal poaching for tusks, not for hides,''said Bill Whitlock, Acme vice president of marketing.   ``They have run ads showing grotesque pictures,'' he saidThursday. ``This drew our concern. We thought it best todisassociate ourselves with it in general even though this involvedtusks and not hides.''   No special interest groups had contacted Acme about dropping theline. ``There was no pressure,'' Whitlock said.   The elephant-skin boots, which were dyed mostly in light colorsto fit a casual image, accounted for less than 1 percent of Acme'stotal production.   ``The boots are very masculine, rugged looking,'' Whitlock said.``They were tough; they wore well and had a long life. They wentwell with jeans.''   Acme, which employs 2,200, has plants in Clarksville andWaverly, Tenn.,; El Paso, Texas, and Corcoran, Mass.</TEXT></DOC>
