The storm earlier spun off 41 tornadoes and killedthree people in Texas and Oklahoma.   The low-pressure system that last week was the strongesthurricane on record in the Western Hemisphere spread showers andthunderstorms along a line toward the northeast, with gusts toabout 40 mph this morning.   The storm system itself picked up speed to about 45 to 50 mph,said Dan McCarthy, of the National Weather Service.   ``It's scooting,'' said McCarthy, of the Severe Storms Center inKansas City, Mo.   Meanwhile, workers in Monterrey, Mexico, searched for the bodiesof up to 200 people swept away when a river swollen by hurricanerains poured over its banks and overturned four buses. Ninetybodies were recovered and a total of 191 people were confirmed deadin the aftermath of Gilbert outside the United States.   Late Sunday, the storm moved over Wichita Falls, Texas, withrain and high wind, and today it was over eastern Oklahoma.   An area west of Wichita Falls was deluged with 4{ inches ofrain, and roads in Ozona, in western Texas, were under water. Themass of moisture extended to Chicago.   Parts of Oklahoma received up to 8 inches of rain in two days,causing minor flooding.   About a dozen residents of a low-lying area in Kingfisher,Okla., evacuated late Sunday, and others were told to be ready toleave. Kingfisher Creek was expected to rise as much as 4 feetabove flood stage today, said police dispatcher Lois Darling.   ``It's already a foot past flood stage and rising,'' Ms. Darlingsaid early today.   Elsewhere in Oklahoma, a 50-year-old pilot from Santa Fe, N.M.,was killed late Saturday when his plane broke apart while flyingnear Muskokee, northeast of Oklahoma City, in heavy rain producedby Gilbert, authorities said.   Although the brunt of the hurricane missed the U.S. Gulf Coast,at least 41 tornadoes spun off by the storm damaged homes andbusinesses in Texas.   The Rio Grande River in southwest Texas was expected to rise to12 feet above flood stage.   In San Antonio, a man was killed Friday when a twister knocked autility pole onto his home, and woman died early Saturday after atornado ripped through her mobile home.   ``We'll take one day at a time. We'll clean up and eventuallywe'll get our own house put up if we get some money to buy lumberand tin,'' said Deborah Dickens, whose mother-in-law, EmilyDickens, was killed.   Other tornadoes in San Antonio uprooted trees, snapped powerlines and tore off roofs. Damage there was estimated at more than$35 million, including $25 million harm to aircraft parts at KellyAir Force Base.   Sylvia Sulsh, 54, said she was taking a shower early Saturdaywhen a tornado struck her apartment at a San Antonio complex whereat least 120 units were destroyed, 264 others damaged and 300tenants left homeless.   ``I got out of the shower and braced myself against the door andthen I saw the roof fall down in the living room,'' Ms. Sulsh said.   Mayor Henry Cisneros said the city was lucky the death toll waslow.   Crews restored power and telephone service Sunday and removeddebris from streets, while those whose homes were damaged maderepairs.   The storm killed at least 98 people while coursing theCaribbean, including 29 in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, where it hitwith winds of up to 200 mph, 26 in Jamaica, 30 in Haiti, five inthe Dominican Republic and eight in Honduras.   Offshoots of the hurricane produced heavy rain over the FloridaPanhandle last week and miles of roads and bridges remained floodedtoday around the city of Milton, about 30 miles northeast ofPensacola. So far this month, Pensacola has recorded 11.7 inches ofrain; normal rainfall for the period is 4.6 inches.   The Blackwater River at Milton rose above its banks for a secondtime in as many weeks Saturday, damaging about 40 houses and 20mobile homes, said Tom Roche, civil defense director for Santa RosaCounty. The first round of flooding was caused by rain associatedwith Hurricane Florence.</TEXT></DOC>
