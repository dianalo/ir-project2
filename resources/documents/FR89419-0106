The Partnerships, limited partnerships organized under Delaware law,are non-diversified, closed-end management investment companies registeredunder the 1940 Act. The investment objective of each Partnership to seeklong-term capital appreciation. Each Partnership is an ``employees' securitiescompany'' within the meaning of section 2(a)(13) of the 1940 Act, and operatesin accordance with the terms of an exemptive order issued pursuant to section6(b) of the 1940 Act (Investment Company Act Release No. 12363; April 8,1982) (``KECALP Exemptive Order''). The general partner for each Partnershipis KECALP, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of MerrillLynch andamp; Co. (``ML andamp; Co.''). KECALP is responsible for managingand making investment decisions for the Partnerships. MLIF, a Delawarecorporation engaged in commercial financing transactions, is an indirectsubsidiary of ML andamp; Co., a holding company which, through its subsidiaries,provides investment, financing, real estate, insurance and related services.<ITAG tagnum="84">Investment in Prince Holdings, Inc.</ITAG>2. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets (``MLCM'') is an unincorporated groupwithin Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner andamp; Smith (``MLPFandamp;S''), theprincipal subsidiary of ML andamp; Co. MLCM conducts the investment bankingand underwriting activities of MLPFandamp;S. On behalf of Brentwood Associates,a California-based investment partnership, MLCM structured a leveragedbuyout during 1987 of Prince Manufacturing, Inc. (``PMI''), a company engagedin the manufacture and sale of tennis racquets and related tennis products.As a result of the transactions involved in the leveraged buyout, PrinceHoldings, Inc. (``Prince''), a corporation organized solely for the purposeof effecting the leveraged buyout, acquired the securities of PMI. Theequity securities of Prince were purchased by members of Prince's management,ML andamp; Co., and certain other institutional investors not affiliatedwith ML andamp; Co. or its subsidiaries. Following complete implementationof the buyout, PMI was merged into Prince. ML andamp; Co.'s ownership ofPrince's Series A convertible Preferred Stock (``Prince Stock'') represented5% of the outstanding shares, on a fully-diluted basis.3. The investment opportunity in Prince Stock was brought to the attentionof KECALP during October, 1987. After evaluation of the investment, KECALPdetermined to purchase 125,000 shares of Prince Stock from ML andamp; Co.for the 1986 Partnership. KECALP approved the 1986 Partnership's purchaseof the investment on October 6, 1987. Because the 1986 Partnership couldnot purchase such an investment from ML andamp; Co. directly, KECALP agreedto purchase the Prince Stock on behalf of the 1986 Partnership and to sellthe stock to the 1986 Partnership following receipt of the order requested.On December 17, 1987, KECALP acquired 125,000 shares of Prince Stock at$1 per share. The amount of shares purchased represented less than 2% ofPrince Stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis. No dividends have beendeclared on such stock.<ITAG tagnum="84">Investment in John Alden Financial Corporation</ITAG>4. During 1987, MLCM, together with The John Alden Group's management andGeneral Electric Credit Corporation, structured a leveraged buyout of TheJohn Alden Group, a diversified insurance company comprised of John AldenLife Insurance Company, Aristar Capital Corporation, John Alden Life InsuranceCompany of New York and Houston National Life Insurance Company. As a resultof the transactions involved in the leveraged buyout, John Alden FinancialCorporation (``JAFC''), a corporation organized for the sole purpose offacilitating the leveraged buyout, acquired the outstanding common stockof The John Alden Group through a merger transaction. The common stockof JAFC (``JAFC Common'') is owned by Merrill Lynch Capital Partners, Inc.(``MLCP''), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ML andamp; Co., MLIF, certain membersof John Alden Group's management, General Electric Credit Corporation,Employers Reinsurance Corporation and Kidder Peabody andamp; Co., Inc. TheSeries B Participating Preferred Stock of JAFC (``JAFC Preferred'') isowned by MLIF and MLCP. Following full implementation of the leveragedbuyout, John Alden Group was merged into JAFC.5. On October 30, 1987, MLIF purchased 10,816 shares of JAFC Preferredand 3,205 shares of JAFC Common, each at $100 per share. Shares purchasedrepresented 6.7% and 2.7%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of JAFCPreferred and JAFC Common on a fully-diluted basis.6. MLIF has agreed to sell to the 1987 Partnership up to 3,579 shares ofJAFC Preferred and up to 1,060 shares of JAFC Common. Such amounts represent0.022% and 0.008% of the outstanding shares, respectively, on a fully-dilutedbasis. No dividends have been declared on such stocks.7. The purchase price to be paid by the 1986 Partnership to KECALP forthe shares of Prince Stock and by the 1987 Partnership to MLIF for theshares of JAFC Preferred and JAFC Common will in each case be the lowerof (i) the value of the investment on the date it is acquired by the Partnership(as determined in good faith by the KECALP Board of Directors) or (ii)the cost to the affiliated person of purchasing and holding the investmentfor the Partnership. The Partnerships will not pay any carrying costs inrespect of the period prior to the later of (1) the date of acquisitionof the securities by the affiliated person or (2) the date KECALP approvedthe Partnership's purchase of the proposed investment. With respect toclause (ii), such cost shall be the original purchase price paid for thesecurities, plus carrying costs related to the investment. For purposesof these transactions, carrying costs consist of interest charges computedat the lower of (i) the prime commercial lending rate charged by Citibank,N.A. during the period from the date KECALP approved the Partnership'spurchase of the investment until the Partnership acquires the investmentor (ii) the effective cost of borrowings by ML andamp; Co. during such period.The effective cost of borrowings by ML andamp; Co. is its actual ``AverageCost of Funds,'' which it calculates on a monthly basis by dividing itsconsolidated financing expenses by the total amount of borrowings duringthis period.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Legal Conclusions</ITAG>8. As a result of affiliations, sales of securities on a principal basisby KECALP and MLIF to a Partnerships are prohibited by section 17 and cannotbe effected unless exemptive relief is obtained under section 17(b). Thestatutory standards with respect to the relief requested under section17(b) are satisfied. Relief is justified both by the terms of the transactionsand the fact that the proposed investments are not otherwise availableto the Partnerships. With respect to the terms of the transactions, KECALPhas reviewed the proposed investments in detail. The members of the KECALPBoard of Directors are sophisticated and experienced in valuing securitiesand in evaluating financial transactions generally. In this regard, KECALPconsidered all information deemed relevant, including the nature of theinvestments, the nature of the investments by affiliates of ML andamp; Co.,and the fairness of the purchase prices proposed to be paid by the Partnerships.The KECALP Board of Directors determined that the proposed investmentsby the Partnerships will not directly or indirectly benefit entities affiliatedwith ML andamp; Co. or its subsidiaries which have also acquired investmentsin Prince and JAFC. Moreover, the KECALP Board approved the Partnerships'investments in Prince and JAFC after consideration of each of the factorsset forth in section 17(b) of the 1940 Act.9. In evaluating the terms of the transactions, the KECALP Board consideredthe fact that the proposed purchase prices to be paid by the Partnershipswill include carrying costs incurred by an affiliated person if the valueof the investment at the time of acquisition by the relevant Partnershipis more than the sum of the purchase price plus the affiliate's carryingcosts. In approving purchase prices which may include carrying costs, theKECALP Board of Directors recognized that KECALP receives no compensationfor serving as general partner of the Partnerships and that ML andamp; Co.has incurred considerable expenses in organizing the Partnerships. ThePartnerships believe that it is appropriate to reimburse affiliates forcarrying costs in a situation where the affiliate effectively purchasesan investment as a Partnership's nominee and the Partnership would havepurchased such investment directly, had it not been deemed necessary toobtain the relief requested. In light of these factors, the KECALP Boardbelieves it is wholly appropriate for the purchase price paid for portfolioinvestments to reflect carrying costs, provided that the value of the investmentsat the time of acquisition exeeds the amount of the purchase price, pluscarrying costs. The Applicants submit that to deny reimbursement for carryingcosts would result in a further and unwarranted loss to KECALP and MLIFand would provide a disincentive to act on behalf of the Partnerships infuture transactions of this type.10. With respect to the 1986 Partnership's acquisition of Prince Stock,the Applicants believe that the 1986 Partnership is adequately protectedfrom any conflicts of interest which may inhere in KECALP's sale of theinvestment at a value which KECALP will determine under the purchase priceformula. KECALP was selected as nominee for the 1986 Partnership's investmentin Prince, and is expected to serve as primary nominee for the KECALP Partnershipsin the future, for the following reasons. Because exemptive relief is generallyrequired for investments by KECALP Partnerships, ML andamp; Co. or one ofits affiliates typically acquires and holds an investment on behalf ofa KECALP Partnership until the Commission issues an order permitting thepurchase. Various problems can arise under this arrangement. First, a nomineemust maintain certain records concerning the investment held for the KECALPPartnership, such as records of carrying costs and of any distributionsreceived from or payments required to be made to the portfolio companyunder the terms of the arrangement. Second, a delay in obtaining exemptiverelief may affect the periodic financial reports of the nominee. Such reports,which are intended to reflect the results of operations of ML andamp; Co.and its operating subsidiaries, may be distorted by capital transactionswhich are attributable to investments on behalf of a KECALP Partnershipor borrowings in connection with the investments. Third, the purchase priceformula places the risk that the investment will decline in value uponthe nominee, rather than the KECALP Partnership. Because KECALP is notintended to function as a profit center within the ML andamp; Co. complex,its selection as nominee alleviates such problems. The Applicants alsobelieve that the special nature of the KECALP Partnerships as employees'securities companies, KECALP's relationship to the Partnerships and itsfiduciary duty to the Partnerships provide adequate protection with respectto KECALP's valuation of an investment which it has purchased as nomineefor a Partnership. First, the KECALP Board of Directors is principallycomposed of individuals who represent senior management of various directand indirect subsidiaries of ML andamp; Co. Most of these individuals arealso investors in the 1986 Partnership. Second, KECALP receives no feeper se for its services to the KECALP Partnerships, and the relative profitsor losses of KECALP do not affect the compensation received by its Directors.The 1986 Partnership reimburses KECALP for related operating expenses inamounts of up to 1% of the limited partners' capital contributions. Expensesnot reimbursed are deemed a capital contribution to the 1986 Partnership.In addition, KECALP is entitled to a 1% interest in all items of the 1986Partnership's income, gain, deduction, loss and credit, for which it hasno obligation to make a cash capital contribution. Thus, to the extentthat KECALP has a financial interest in the operations of the 1986 Partnership,its interest is generally the same as that of the limited partners. Lastly,KECALP is under a fiduciary duty to value investments under the purchaseprice formula in the best interests of the 1986 Partnership. The Applicantssubmit that the existing fiduciary responsibilities of KECALP, togetherwith the considerations discussed above, are adequate to provide protectionto the 1986 Partnership with respect to the valuation of the investmentin Prince. 11. The Applicants also state that the investments are not otherwise availablefor purchase by the Partnerships. The KECALP Board has approved such investmentsafter review of a considerable number of possible investments for the Partnerships.The Partnerships state that their respective investment programs will beprejudiced if they are not permitted to make the investments proposed inthis Application. 12. The Board of Directors of KECALP believes that the proposed investmentsare consistent with the rationale underlying the establishment of eachof the Partnerships as an ``employees' securities company.'' It was indicatedin the application for exemptive relief granted in the KECALP ExemptiveOrder, as well as in the prospectuses of the Partnerships, that ML andamp;Co. and its affiliates would be involved in structuring, identifying andinvesting in many of the Partnerships' portfolio investments. The Partnershipsstate that the relief requested herein is thus consistent with their purposesand stated policies. <ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Conditions </ITAG>If the requested order is granted, Applicants agree to the following conditions:1. The investments in Prince and JAFC will be acquired by the Partnershipsin the manner and on the terms described above. 2. In connection with the deliberations and determinations by the KECALPBoard of Directors regarding the Partnerships' proposed Prince and JAFCtransactions, appropriate record-keeping will be maintained and made availablefor inspection by the Commission and by the limited partners of the Partnershipsin accordance with the KECALP Exemptive Order and the 1940 Act.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, underdelegated authority. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
