ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republican George Bush and Democrat MichaelDukakis today celebrated victorious conclusions to the long primaryseason, with Dukakis declaring, ``The marathon is over and now therace to the finish line begins.'' Jesse Jackson renewed his claimon the Democrats' No. 2 spot but Dukakis said no one ``is due anoffer.''   Both Bush and Dukakis, assured of their parties' presidentialnominations, pledged a tough but clean election fight offeringvoters a clear choice.   ``I feel terrific. Here I am as the Democratic nominee,''Dukakis exulted in an interview broadcast today on CBS-TV.   Jackson, his last remaining opponent, promised in interviewsbroadcast today that he would continue the nomination fight all theway to the convention in Atlanta. But Jackson, implicitly concedingthe fight was really over, said repeatedly he had earned a Dukakisoffer of the vice presidential spot.   ``I've earned an option to accept it or turn it down,'' he saidon CBS in an interview taped earlier. On ABC-TV he said,``Consideration does mean an offer; it does not mean just inpassing. We have earned consideration.'' He did not say whether hewould accept such an offer.   Dukakis, making no promises, said on ABC, ``I don't think anyoneis due an offer.''   He told reporters later in the day, ``I'm going to cast my netfar and wide.'' He said Jackson deserved consideration, ``but thereare other people to be considered as well, and it's up to thenominee to make that selection.''   In Washington today, former candidate Paul Simon said he wouldsupport Dukakis for president, and he urged his 150 or so remainingdelegates to do the same unless they felt strongly they shouldsupport Jackson.   Sen. Simon, D-Ill., who had put his fading campaign on hold twomonths ago, said at a news conference, ``The primaries and caucusesare now history. The verdict is in. I will vote for Michael Dukakisat the convention and will do everything I can to advance hiscandidacy after the convention.''   Dukakis was also picking up formal support today from formerrivals Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Bruce Babbitt of Arizona.   ``The race to the finish line begins,'' proclaimed a jubilantDukakis after returns from a four-state primary sweep guaranteedhim a delegate majority. He won races in California, New Jersey,Montana and New Mexico.   ``Now we'll be going into the major-league ballgame and I amready on the issues,'' declared Bush, who locked up the GOPnomination more than a month ago and cruised to uncontested wins inthe states voting Tuesday.   Dukakis' season-ending sweep gave the Massachusetts governorvictories in 30 states. The marathon primary contest began withseven contenders, but over the last two months came down to ahead-to-head battle between Dukakis and Jackson.   The magic number for a convention majority was 2,081 and Dukakiseasily surpassed that with his landslide finale. His delegate totalafter Tuesday's sweep stood at 2,251, according to the latestAssociated Press count.   Confronted by polls saying Dukakis was the current choice of amajority of voters, Bush said, ``I'm fighting back. I'm theunderdog now.''   While Dukakis could enter the race with an edge in polls showingAmericans wanting a change after nearly eight years of RonaldReagan's presidency, Bush could find strength in the Republicanhold on the electoral votes of Southern and Western states.   The vice president was meeting this morning in Washington withReagan.   Dukakis said voters were not interested in ``slashing attacks''and he warned the Republicans not to engage in ``mudslinging andname-calling.''   ``I don't think you have to run a negative, nasty campaign,''said Bush. ``What I think you have to do though is be sure theAmerican people perceive what you really want for this country.''   Party unity and the search for running mates were top prioritiesfor both Bush and Dukakis as they looked ahead to their partyconventions _ the Democrats in July, the Republicans in August _and beyond.   Bush was flying to Denver Friday to open a unity conference atwhich three of his former rivals for the nomination would appear _Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York and televisionevangelist Pat Robertson.   Campaigning in California for two days before the primary, Bushpreviewed his fall strategy, repeatedly portraying theMassachusetts governor as a liberal likely to advocate taxincreases.   ``Michael Dukakis said he would not rule out a tax increase,''Bush said. ``I'll rule it out.''   For Dukakis, Jackson remained an unpredictable figure in anotherwise smooth road to party unity. Commanding the loyalty ofblack voters who are a critical part of the Democratic Party'scoalition, Jackson will have more than 1,000 delegates at theDemocratic National Convention in Atlanta. Dukakis predicted therewould be ``a floor fight or two'' over platform issues, but nonethat would split the party.   Both Bush and Dukakis hit rough spots on their drives for thepresidential nominations of their parties.   On the ropes when the campaign reached New Hampshire, he stageda comeback that shattered Dole's hopes for a quick knockout. Thenon March 8, Super Tuesday, Bush swept 16 primaries and effectivelyended the Republican contest.   For Dukakis, the race started according to plan with a crediblethird-place finish in Iowa and a strong victory in New Hampshire.Victories in Texas and Florida on Super Tuesday established hiscredentials as more than a regional candidate from the Northeast,but he stumbled in Illinois and again in Michigan.   However, Dukakis then put together the string of victories thatquieted such speculation and put him in command of the race.   In the final contests, Dukakis defeated Jackson by margins ofbetter than 2 to 1 in New Jersey, New Mexico and Montana. Returnsfrom California were putting him ahead in that state by acomparable margin.   In New Jersey, with returns from 99 percent of the precinctscounted, Dukakis had 405,639 or 63 percent. Jackson had 209,762, or33 percent. With 100 percent counted, Bush had 236,140 for 94percent.   In New Mexico, with returns from 97 percent of the precincts, itwas Dukakis 109,957 or 61 percent, to Jackson's 49,797 or 28percent. Bush had 78 percent of the vote, translating into 65,733votes from 97 percent of the precincts.   In Montana, with returns from 99 percent of the precincts,Dukakis had 82,034, or 69 percent. Jackson had 26,571, or 22percent. Bush had 73 percent, or 62,395 votes.   In California, with 97 percent of the precincts counted, Dukakishad 1,798,759 or 61 percent. Jackson had 1,049,895 or 35 percent.Bush had 83 percent, or 1,840,053.</TEXT></DOC>
