While the issues seem to develop as suddenly as a summerthunderstorm, usually they have simmered for many months within theindustry or between the industry and insurance commissioners.   The beginning of one such issue could be right now. Workers'compensation insurance seems to be getting out of control. Claimsare soaring, and a study of the industry suggests profits have justabout disappeared.   ``The system is being overused,'' says Robert A. Brian, whosestudy is now being circulated among property and casualty insurers.``We either control the benefits,'' he says, ``or I see no reasonfor insurers to continue writing.''   Brian isn't an insurer, but he knows the industry thoroughlysince he is senior vice president of Conning andamp; Co., a Hartford-basedsecurities firm that specializes in insurance companies. He isresponsible for all its research.   In 1989, he estimates the entire industry will write $28.4billion of premiums and pay out $26.8 billion, leaving a balance of$1.6 billion. That is, payouts will amount to about 94 percent ofthe money taken in.   To the uninitiated that might not seem too bad, but if you lookback in Brian's statistical sheets you'll see that in 1982 thepercentage was only 73.5. But that, he points out, is only thebeginning of the story.   When deductions are made for administrative expenses, inflationand dividends paid to policyholders, says Brian, the industry willend the year having paid out $1.20 for every dollar collected.That's not good business.   Yes, but the companies will have had the use of billions ofdollars during the year, and that should provide them withinvestment income. True, said Brian. It will bring them back to thebreak-even point. That is, zero return.   He suggests that with no return on capital, companies aren'tlikely to persist very long in writing this essential form ofinsurance, which reimburses employees for lost income and medicalcosts.   As he sees it, the benefits system has to be controlled. Viewinga graph of benefits paid since 1975 gives the impression of a spiralwinding up for a bust. Claims totaled $5.2 billion in 1975; in 1988,an estimated $23.9 billion.   The issue of who will pay _ employers or insurers _ is important,but it probably isn't the bigger problem. Potentially larger is howto save a system whose users seem to be imposing a steadily higherburden on it.   Many factors are involved. Theoretically, says Brian, you couldpoint to several economic factors, such as the size of the workforce, wage inflation and medical inflation.   You might also point the finger at legislated benefits increases,including the broadening view of what constitutes a compensableclaim.   He discounts the possibility of these being the main factors. Infact, he calls attention to a decline over recent years in thepressure exerted by state legislatures. The main reason, he says, issystem overuse.   To offer that explanation is perhaps to invite inquiry intosociological factors, but somehwere in that area are some answers.Whatever the reason, relief is needed or a crisis could develop.   Insurers have a reputation, sometimes applied scornfully, ofwatching every penny. Some might seek to cut their own expenses, butfailing in that area they seem likely to raise rates. And that'swhen the storm breaks.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thursday, July 13</NOTE></DOC>
