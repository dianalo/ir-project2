(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A probate judge has upheld a will thatleft custody of a 17-month-old boy to the mother's female companion.   However, a lawyer for the child's grandparents said they willcontinue to fight for guardianship.   ``The decision and the hearings really dealt only with theadmission of the will. There really wasn't any attempt to evaluatethe fitness of the candidates for guardianship. We think thereought to be complete and professional evaluation,'' said PatrickMonaghan Jr., who is representing Elsa and Philip Hamilton ofMontvale, N.J.   Susan Hamilton died in a May 15 car accident. Her will names hercompanion of 12 years, Susan Bellemare, as guardian of CollinPhilip Hamilton, a son she conceived by artificial insemination.   Hamilton's parents had contested the will, saying Bellemareexerted ``undue influence'' on their daughter. They also claimedBellemare's roles as guardian, as well as trustee and executor ofthe estate, presented a conflict.   But a judge upheld the will Tuesday, in a case that lawyersbelieve could set a legal precedent in Vermont by defining therights of two people of the same sex who raise children together.   Judge L. John Cain of Chittenden Probate Court ruled the willwas executed in accordance with legal requirements.   ``Susan Bellemare was examined and is found to be mentallycompetent and physically able'' to be Collin's guardian, he alsowrote in a four-page decision.   Bellemare, who has had custody since last month, could not bereached for comment. Her lawyer, Susan Murray of Middlebury,declined comment.   Hamilton and Bellemare were nurses at the Medical CenterHospital of Vermont in Burlington, where Bellemare still works.They also owned a house together in Waterbury.   Both women and the child were involved in the May 15 accident.Collin had been in New Jersey with his grandparents since thecrash, but Bellemare gained custody after a hearing June 30. Thegrandparents were allowed visitation rights.</TEXT></DOC>
