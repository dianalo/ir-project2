He said his repaired right shoulder isthe strongest it has been in years, and he senses the importance of his secondhalf.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THUMBS UP FOR DOWNS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  N.L. ReportSome information in this report was obtained from writers in other cities.  </MEMO><TEXT>     The Giants signed the 30-year-old, oft-disappointing right-hander lastwinter to a one-year, $525,000 contract. He is not eligible for free agencyuntil after the 1992 season, but a strong second half could persuademanagement to give him a multiyear contract rather than risk losing him thefollowing winter for basically nothing. Downs also could make himselfappealing trade material.;    &quot;I've felt the last two weeks better than ever,&quot;said Downs, who has a 40-36 career record and had his rotator cuff fixed inApril 1990. &quot;My arm is 100 percent, and I'm throwing harder. I'd like to be inthe rotation, but I'm happy where I am because that's where it's turned aroundfor me. If I can keep throwing in the 'pen like this, we'll see what happens.If another team inquires, that's great.;    &quot;It's funny -- as soon as I wentback to the 'pen, it turned me around. I'm on a real light maintenance programwith my shoulder there, and maybe that has made my arm stronger.&quot;; INTELLIGENCE REPORT: Jose Uribe was just getting in a groove when Rex Hudlercleated him. Uribe hit .091 in April, .182 in May and .200 in June. But wait-- there's more from the Giants' first-half stat breakdown:;    (check) MikeFelder hit .427 against N.L. West teams and .194 against the East. The newleadoff man hit .429 against Los Angeles, .393 against Atlanta and .381against Cincinnati -- the West's first-division teams.;    (check) Bud Blackwas signed as a free agent because his pitching is conducive to CandlestickPark. He had a 2.52 ERA and gave up only three homers there. But he had a 4.88ERA on the road and allowed 10 homers there.;     (check) Will Clark hit .257at home and .341 away. But 12 of his 16 homers were at Candlestick.;    (check) Of Kevin Mitchell's 14 homers, 11 were off right-handers. But then, ofMitchell's 14 strikeouts, 12 were by right-handers.;    (check) Young and oldsometimes act alike. Trevor Wilson's ERA was 2.88 in 10 games at the 'Stickand 5.40 in 16 games on the road. Don Robinson's ERA was 2.80 in 10 games athome and 6.10 in 11 games on the road.;    (check) Dave Anderson hit .429 inApril, .260 in May, .194 in June and was 1 for 6 (.167) in July before thebreak. His contract expires this winter.;  RISKY BUSINESS: John Kruk's homerThursday against the Giants was his 12th, and the two RBIs gave him 57. Yet,Philadelphia's All-Star first baseman/outfielder is approaching a serioussituation.;    An examination of his right knee Wednesday showed that Kruk hasa small tear in the cartilage. He is eligible for free agency after the seasonand so far has put himself in position for a sizable offer.;    Kruk injuredhis knee in batting practice July 1, and he proceeded to go 3 for 19 (.158)until the Giants came to town. Some people think he would be wise to undergosurgery now rather than risk decreasing his value. Kruk is a hard-nosed sort,and he said there is no stopping now.;    &quot;I've got to play the way I'vealways played,&quot; he said. &quot;If something happens, it happens, and I make a visitto the doctor.&quot;;  EXCLUSIVE CLUB: For pitchers, winning 300 games has been themeasure of greatness. But what about saving 300?;    The formation of a new300-save club was announced at the All-Star Game, and charter members include:Rollie Fingers (341), Jeff Reardon (308), Rich &quot;Goose&quot; Gossage (307) and BruceSutter (300). For Reardon (Red Sox) and Gossage (Rangers), the totals werethrough the season's first half.;    Giants reliever Dave Righetti had 235saves at the break and should join the club before his new, four-year contractends. He is the all-time left-handed saves leader.;  WHO'S LAUGHING NOW?Cincinnati shortstop Barry Larkin had the last laugh at the expense of BoSchembechler, the former University of Michigan football coach and currentpresident of the Detroit Tigers. Larkin played baseball for the Wolverines,and he had been an outstanding defensive back in high school.;   &quot;(Schembechler) used to come out to the games and say, 'Larkin, get away fromthis sissy game.' I saw him at a banquet a couple of weeks ago and I said,'Look at you; you're right in the thick of it now.' &quot;;  AROUND THE HORN:Re-signing second baseman Bill Doran was the best move Cincinnati made lastwinter. He was hitting .309 at the break, while Mariano Duncan was hitting.215. . . . Atlanta's Tom Glavine was 12-4 with a 1.98 ERA and started for theN.L. at Toronto. So how come he's 0-8 all-time against Houston? . . . Montrealsecond baseman Delino DeShields had 17 errors in the first half. &quot;I've failedbefore in athletics, but this is the first time I've lost control,&quot; he said. .. . Dodgers first baseman Eddie Murray is peeved that the club has not offeredhim a new contract. He can be a free agent this winter, and former teammateTerry Kennedy has predicted Murray will wind up in Anaheim. &quot;It's gettingnerve-racking,&quot; Murray said. &quot;(Manager Tommy Lasorda) keeps saying I'm goingto be back, but I don't know.&quot; . . . Houston was two games better (34-47) atthe break than last season. It has an infinitely lower payroll and the topN.L. rookie this season, first baseman Jeff Bagwell. . . . The N.L. has notscored more than three runs in an All-Star Game since a 6-1 victory in 1985.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mark Newman  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910714  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,037  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday July 14, 199100196204,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
