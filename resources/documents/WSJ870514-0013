Worthen, Arkansas's largest banking company, disclosed that it replaced its longstanding independent accountants last year after a series of disagreements concerning the adequacy of its 1985 loan-loss allowance and disclosure of lawsuits against Worthen, among other things.    Worthen, with $2.1 billion assets and 10 banking units, was reviewed by the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Arkansas bank regulators. As a result, bank regulators have increased their scrutiny of Worthen by requiring it to submit various written plans, policies and procedures to the St. Louis Fed, including its so-far unsuccessful attempt to name a chairman of the company, its debt-service plans, capital levels and its business plan for the remainder of 1987 and 1988.    Moreover, Worthen must enlist an independent management consultant to review its organization and management structure and report back to the St. Louis Fed. Worthen also must either charge off as losses or collect all loans or parts of loans that it classified as losses by last Sept. 30. The regulators examined the condition of the company as of that date.    Worthen signed a regulatory agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank last March, and made a brief public announcement of the action at the time. However, it didn't disclose that bank regulators took a dim view of its operations and the &quot;problem&quot; status of seven of its bank units, one of which it sold this year.    Both the FDIC and the comptroller's office, which regulates nationally chartered banks, compile a list of &quot;problem&quot; banks. The list now exceeds 1,500 institutions, or about 10% of the nation's banks. These are banks which, after a federal examination, are considered at best to have serious financial weaknesses, and at worst are likely to fail without immediate corrective steps. It isn't known precisely how federal regulators characterized the problems of six of Worthen's banks.    Worthen began running into trouble in 1985 when it reported a $49.8 million loss, in part because of the collapse of Bevill, Bresler andamp; Schulman Asset Management Corp. a New Jersey securities dealer that had $52 million in repurchase agreements with Worthen Bank andamp; Trust Co. The loss was only partially recovered. Since then, Worthen has experienced heavy loan losses in its real estate and commercial lending operations. Last year, it reported a $37.6 million loss.    The additional information was disclosed in Worthen's 1986 annual report, which was released this week. In the report, Worthen said it intends &quot;to fully comply with all provisions&quot; of the agreement with the federal regulators. A Worthen executive didn't return phone calls yesterday seeking comment on Worthen's progress in complying with the regulatory agreement.    Also in the report, Curt Bradbury, Worthen's president and chief executive officer, told shareholders, &quot;We can't predict the timing of the end of the extraordinary charge-offs. But we do have a reasonable plan in place to manage the problem and prevent its recurrence.&quot;    Yesterday, officials of the St. Louis Fed, the comptroller's office and the FDIC declined to comment on the agreement and Worthen's disclosure.    Worthen said it replaced Ernst andamp; Whinney, its audit firm for more than a decade, with Peat Marwick Main andamp; Co. in May 1986 after Ernst andamp; Whinney finished its work on the 1985 financial reports. Michael Barron, Ernst andamp; Whinney's partner in charge of the Worthen account, said the firm wasn't asked by Worthen to submit a proposal last spring when Worthen was taking bids for the job. &quot;We were just not asked,&quot; he said. He said Worthen later made satisfactory changes to its financial statements and its annual report. In both years, Worthen received unqualified opinions from its auditors. </TEXT></DOC>
