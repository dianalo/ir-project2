The estimate variance isa function of a type of drilling grid (size and shape of drilling grid).Based on the given semi-variate difference function, the prospectingaccuracy obtained by various grid types can be evaluated by computersimulation of the prospecting process of changing the grid size fromsparse to dense. At present, there are two methods for selecting optimumbasic size of drilling grid, one is a curve of mean estimate standarddeviation vs. the number of boreholes (for a given grid type), the otheris a curve of a coefficient of controllable degrees vs. the number ofboreholes D. The optimum basic size of drilling grid can be selectedby taking into account both methods. The guaranteed rate of various reservescan be evaluated by establishing a curve of normal distribution of probability.2 refs., 7 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
