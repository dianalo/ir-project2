In a ceremony in a hotel meeting room today, President Reaganwas signing legislation bringing American copyright law intocompliance with the 102-year-old Bern Convention for the Protectionof Literary and Artistic Works.   The Senate ratified the treaty on Oct. 20, but legislationmaking changes in American copyright laws was also needed beforethe United States could become a full-fledged member of theconvention.   Differences between American and other nations' copyright lawsstalled ratification for decades, but many of the obstacles wereremoved when Congress enacted a sweeping overhaul of U.S. copyrightlaw in 1976.   Participation in the convention will enable the United States tohave copyright relations with 24 countries with which it now hasnone, officials said.   The convention was signed in Bern on Sept. 9, 1886. It spellsout minimum copyright standards, detailing what is protected andhow long the copyright lasts. It also bars member nations fromdiscriminating against protected works from other member states.   The signing ceremony was the only public event on thepresident's schedule today.   On Sunday, Reagan and his wife, Nancy, traveled from their ranchnorth of Santa Barbara to receive awards from the Simon WiesenthalCenter, an organization dedicated to the study of the Holocaust.   In a speech accepting the center's 1988 humanitarian award, thepresident said his administration has made U.S. ties with Israel``warmer than they have ever been'' and added:   ``We must remain strong, and we must be willing to use forcewhen we are under threat. This is a lesson that binds us stillcloser to the state of Israel; for the fact is, a strong Israeldepends upon a strong America.''   Reagan also announced that he will soon sign enablinglegislation passed this year to facilitate U.S. adherence to theUnited Nations convention on genocide, which the Senate ratified in1986 after a long campaign by Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis. Aidessaid the president is expected to sign the legislation on Thursdayin Washington.   The award to the president was given for his efforts on behalfof peace and his support of Israel.   It was presented at a dinner held on the 80th birthday of SimonWiesenthal, who has worked with the U.S. and other governments inlocating Nazi war criminals. Wiesenthal joined the president andothers at the head table.
