ROSENFELD</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hostile soybean farmers confrontedofficials of the Chicago Board of Trade on Friday and colleaguesapplauded their criticism.   There was a more reserved reception for an official of the $30billion Ferruzzi Group of Italy, which at one time this monthcontrolled 56 percent of the contracts on the exchange for the Julydelivery of soybeans and claimed it was victimized when it wasforced to sell out over an eight-day period.   At the end of the separate sessions before a convention of theAmerican Soybean Association, farmers said many questions remainedover the recent soybean trading frenzy and price decline on theexchange. Hard feelings were widespread.   ``Farmers appear to be getting crushed in a battle of giants,''bemoaned James Lee Adams of Camilla, Ga., president of the AmericanSoybean Association. ``ASA wants soybeans to be crushed, notfarmers.''   Two main antagonists _ Karsten Mahlmann, the chairman of theBoard of Trade, and David Swanson, the president of Ferruzzi'sCentral Soya Co. Inc. _ disagreed on the July 11 decision of theexchange to force Ferruzzi and other major traders to liquidatecontracts for July delivery or sale of millions of bushels ofsoybeans.   That decision touched off wild gyrations in soybean prices. TheJuly contract, which stood at $7.26 a bushel before the Board ofTrade action, wound up at $6.88{ a bushel when it expired onThursday.   ``You took sides. It was highly unfair to farmers,'' Ray Heck ofthe Des Moines suburb of Urbandale told Mahlmann in aquestion-and-answer period.   Mahlmann said the exchange board was worried that there were notsufficient supplies available to meet large holdings of contractsfor July delivery of soybeans in the final days of trading.   The result either would be a manipulated upward surge in pricesor defaults on contracts that could threaten the existence of theexchange.   ``We do not let one market participant muscle things around,''he said.   Mahlmann said there were similar contract worries in May, butthe exchange got by ``on the skin of our teeth.''   Heck said the Board of Trade waited too long to act.   ``You knew you had problems in May. You didn't know how tohandle it or have the guts enough to handle it,'' Heck toldMahlmann. ``You waited to handle it in a poor way too late. I don'tthink you're lily white.''   Mahlmann said the exchange was reluctant to take emergencyaction ordering liquidation of contracts because it did not want todisturb markets. He said the board waited until there were no otheralternatives.   Heck jumped in with an accusation of insider manipulation,alleging that the board acted ``as soon as you got your setupmade.'' He was applauded by many members of the audience of morethan 300 people.   Swanson, in later appearances before the convention andreporters, flatly denied any wrongdoing by Ferruzzi or any attemptto corner the market. He called for a study by farmers and tradersto find ways to improve the Board of Trade, which he said hasfailed to keep up with the global expansion of commodities trading.   Earlier, David Kass, the director of market surveillance for thefederal Commodity Futures Trading Commission, confirmed his agencyissued an order of its own to liquidate contracts even before theChicago Board of Trade acted.   He said a large trader, who he did not identify, was given aweek to reduce its position below 3 million bushels.   Swanson confirmed that Ferruzzi had received such an order fromthe CFTC.   He said his company was holding contracts for delivery of 23million bushels of soybeans in July, a holding it began building upa year ago because of worries that it might not be able to fillexport orders or supply its own plants as a result of a reductionof soybean supplies in the 1988 drought.   He said Ferruzzi initially had a small share of the contract butthat its holdings took a bigger share of the outstanding contractsnear the expiration of the July contract because other tradersalready had settled their accounts.   ``We didn't buy anything'' late in the game. ``The universe wasshrinking around us,'' he told soybean producers.   He said the CFTC's private approach would have given Ferruzzitime and flexibility to unwind its position, although he said thecontracts may have been liquidated in an orderly manner withoutsuch intervention.   But he said the public disclosure of the Board of Trade orderand a timetable requiring sales spread out over a specific periodput Ferruzzi ``in a one-sided punitive, inflexible process.''   Mahlmann said the Board of Trade acted so the process would notbe one-sided. He said its orders also affected traders on the otherside of the fence, who sold a large number of contracts short. In ashort sale, a trader sells borrowed soybeans and hopes the pricewill fall before he must buy soybeans to settle his account.   Mahlmann also categorically denied reports that alleged theexchange's action came at the urging of domestic trading giantsCargill Inc. or Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.   ``We won't let any one party influence the marketplace. We won'tbe influenced by any one party. It's absolutely untrue, as someallegations that have been made, that this decision was arrived atat the urgence and for the benefit of domestic companies against aforeign company,'' Mahlmann told reporters.   ``We believe by having taken dramatic effective action we havediscouraged and will not have a recurrence of what we had to do.''   After the presentations, farmer Mike Willette of Delavan, Minn.,said he tended to take Ferruzzi's side.   ``I think farmers got mistreated a little, but after hearingboth sides I'm not 100 percent clear who's right and who's wrong.''   But he said the episode has further eroded the credibility ofthe exchange.   ``Farmers are tending to distrust the Chicago Board of Trademore than before,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
