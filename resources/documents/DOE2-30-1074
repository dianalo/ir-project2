TheRegulatory Guide necessitates the testing of low-level waste forms todemonstrate stability. As a result, vendors have performed and supportedextensive research and testing, results of which are included in theirtopical reports. In the course of NRC's review of these topical reports,the NRC has identified some areas that require further evaluation. Includedamong these are (1) cement waste form long-term structural stability,(2) bitumen waste form strength and viscosity characteristics, and (3)polyethylene high integrity container (HIC) structural stability. Toexpedite their resolution, the NRC will encourage vendor participationin addressing these issues. This paper discusses current NRC activitiesand strategy for dealing with the complex technical issues on waste formstability and describes laboratory testing and analyses, performed byBrookhaven National Laboratory, which play a supportive role in resolvingthese issues. Discussion is also included on the schedule for furtherNRC action in implementing waste form requirements.</TEXT></DOC>
