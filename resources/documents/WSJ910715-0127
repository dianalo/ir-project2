Managers, particularly from non-EC companies, hadbetter be aware that the playing field isn't level.   European companies received an average of $115 billion ayear in state subsidies throughout the 1980s. And there's nolet-up in sight for the '90s. For all the EC's promises thatcompanies will have to sink or swim, the Europeans arecontinuing to pay out as before. Even the EC's vauntedcompetitions policy has yet to impose the tough limits thatwere supposed to restrain the creation of monopolies.Instead, an EC draft memo surfaced last December thatoutlined an industrial policy for Europe. In effect, thepolicy encourages governments to defend their favoritecompanies. As always happens, not least in the U.S., the EC'sregulators have been co-opted to protect entrenchedinterests.</LP><TEXT>   -- Steel: Steel and coal pacts were the original heart ofthe EC, but cartelization overcame a commitment tocompetition. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competitionscommissioner, tried last fall to end subsidies to state steelcompanies and get them to emulate privatized British Steel.He lost the battle. The annual subsidy available tostate-owned steel companies amounts to $225 million a year.The existing situation now looks as if it will continue atleast until the year 2002, when the pact expires. If you wantto build a ship from that subsidized steel, you can get up toan additonal 13% in shipbuilding subsidies for this year.   -- Airlines: European airlines lined up to ask forsubsidies to protect them from the hazards of daily life,such as this winter's 100-hour Gulf war. Air France, whichnow controls 97% of the French internal airline market, askedfor $394 million earlier this year. Belgium's Sabena askedfor $1 billion in relief. On the manufacturing side, Airbushas received an estimated $20 billion.   -- Automobiles: Europe still has too many automakers. Butrather than allow a shakeout, we are seeing lengthy, detailedtalks about voluntary quotas, import monitoring andtransplants -- all designed to leave quotas against Japan inplace in both France and Italy. It is no coincidence thatcompanies with the poorest reputation for quality and theleast developed dealer networks are the ones keeping barriersso high against the Japanese. Less well known but equallyirritating is the 10% duty Detroit must pay on cars it sendsto Europe. There is only a 2% import duty levied on Europeancars sent to the U.S.   -- Telecommunications: The original idea was that localand long distance services would remain tightly and locallyregulated while other sectors would open up. But America's&quot;Baby Bells,&quot; which hope to generate up to 15% of theirrevenues from European operations, are finding that nationaltelephone companies are asking for exemptions that includevaguely defined services via satellite.   -- Stock exchanges: France and Italy want to protect theirnational bourses from the Merrill Lynches and Nomuras, amongother global financial services groups.   -- Regional Aid: Watch this one. This is the mechanismunder which countries sponsor favorites by passing offsubsidies as legitimate development aid to depressed regions.Even the EC doesn't like this subterfuge. Still, Bonn isdirectly helping 2,000 East German companies to keep theirexport markets, against all EC rules.   -- Parimutuel betting: The French subsidize on- andoff-track betting to the tune of several hundred milliondollars a year. One arm of the EC is investigating that.Another arm is going to try to force the British governmentto permit lottery tickets from other EC countries to be soldin Britain.   In short, the economic slowdown has let Europe'sprotectionists come out of hiding. A lot of European managersand most EC politicians were never happy with the idea oftruly free competition.   Europe is indulging in a dangerous pause where personalagendas of special interests threaten to confound the effortsof competitive managers. Now more than ever, it is essentialfor these managers to be aware of the nuances of industrialpolicy in favored sectors.   ---   Mr. Orban is chairman of a Brussels consulting firm.</TEXT></DOC>
