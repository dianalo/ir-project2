The rate, adjusted May 1 and Nov. 1, equals 85% of the average yield on five-year Treasury securities outstanding for the previous six months. It is used to determine the minimum rate that applies to bonds held at least five years. Investors who hold bonds five years or longer receive either 85% of the average rate on marketable Treasury securities during the period the bonds have been held or a minimum guaranteed rate, whichever is higher.    The current minimum rate is 6% for bonds purchased on or after Nov. 1, 1986, and 7.5% for bonds bought between November 1982 and November 1986. Series E bonds, savings notes and Series EE bonds issued through Oct. 31, 1983, will begin receiving market-based yields as they reach semiannual interest dates on or after last Sunday. The average rate for the past five years is 8.5%.    Bonds held for less than five years earn interest on a fixed, graduated scale that starts below 6%. One-third of all American households own at least one savings bond, and the total value of bonds outstanding exceeds $104 billion.    The Treasury said people will be able to order bonds by phone using Visa or MasterCard credit cards, starting today. Callers can also get current rate and other information 24 hours a day. The toll-free number for information or orders is 1-800-US BONDS. </TEXT></DOC>
