This is accomplished by using an extendedKalman filter algorithm to estimate the errors in the reference trajectoryprovided by an INS. In this report, Sandia National Laboratories documentsthe results of a reimbursable effort funded by the Air Force Wright AeronauticalLaboratories (AFWAL) Avionics Laboratory to flight test SITAN as implementedonboard the Advanced Fighter Technology Integration (AFTI)F-16. 5 refs.,101 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
