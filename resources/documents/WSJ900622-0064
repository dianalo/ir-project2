Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady is expected to tellcongressional leaders that the ceiling must be raised inearly August. The debt cap had been expected to expire someweeks later, but in any event, the Treasury needs adebt-limit increase before Congress starts its August recess.</LP><TEXT>   The Treasury's wiggle room was diminished by an immediateaddition of some $27 billion to the amount of debt subject tothe ceiling. That addition occurred when it was discoveredthat the zero-coupon bonds sold by the Treasury to Mexico aspart of a debt-restructuring package don't qualify for a newmethod of calculating zero-coupon bonds subject to the debtceiling. A Treasury spokesman said the department hasnotified Capitol Hill of this development.   The Treasury had been calculating the Mexico deal asadding about $3 billion to the amount of debt subject to thelimit.   The need to act on the debt bill before the August recesscould become a key pressure point for the current WhiteHouse-congressional budget summit. It also could causeuncertainty in the financial markets regarding the Treasury'sAugust refunding, whose details are to be announced Aug. 1.</TEXT></DOC>
