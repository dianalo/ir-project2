Theslow wave was revealed through the presence of its resonance cone. Theexperiment was performed with {Omega}/sub i/ andless;andless; {omega} andless;andless; {Omega}/sube/. The coupling of the fast wave into the slow wave is attributed toparasitic excitation, which is a linear mechanism involving electronE-vector X B-vector motion and charge separation in a density gradient.This process could be a significant loss mechanism for fast wave currentdrive in toroidal plasmas.
