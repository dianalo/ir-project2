He refused to identify the civilians or specify what kind oflegal action would be taken against them. But Cerezo did say thatnone of the leaders of the country's 14 legally registeredpolitical parties was involved.   ``For the moment, we can announce that legal action will betaken in the case ... against those civilians who participated inthe capacity of intellectual planners in the rash attempt,'' hesaid.   Cerezo made his comments during a visit to the Finance Ministry.   Troops arrested two army officers Wednesday morning who wereleading soldiers toward the capital, Defense Minister Gen. HectorAlejandro Gramajo Morales said Wednesday.   He said the two had led officers and soldiers from bases inJutiapa, 75 miles south of Guatemala City, and Retalhuleu, 115miles southwest of the capital.   The government has not said how many mutineers were involved orwhether there was any violence or injury.   Gramajo Morales said those involved were fooled by ``speculationand disinformation'' propagated by civilians, whom he did notidentify.   Col. Arturo Getella, commander of the Jutiapa base, on Thursdayidentified one ringleader as Col. Gustavo Cifuentes, a subcommanderof the same facility.   The afternoon daily La Hora, citing confidential sources,identified the uprising's other leaders as Col. Gustavo AdolfoPadilla, subcommander of the Retalhuleu base, and Manuel MariaGordillo Martinez.   It did not specify Gordillo Martinez's rank or where he wasbased.   The newspaper said Gordillo Martinez is the brother of retiredCol. Francisco Luis Gordillo Martinez, who with Gen. HoracioMaldonado Schadd and Gen. Efrain Rios Montt formed a military juntaafter a coup in March 1982 that overthrew the government of Gen.Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia.   Cerezo, a lawyer and leader of the Christian Democratic Party,won the presidency in November 1985 in the first election in 16years in which the military did not field a candidate.   He succeeded Gen. Oscar Humberto Mejia Victores, who seizedpower in August 1983 from Rios Montt.</TEXT></DOC>
