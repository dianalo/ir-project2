The narrowing from $13.83 billion in February reflected a 23% jump in exports to a record $28.97 billion and a 3.6% rise in imports to $38.72 billion. It far surpassed the expectations of financial market forecasters and many economists and sent the dollar rising on foreign exchange markets. The merchandise trade figures are notoriously volatile, and similar remarkable gains aren't likely to be repeated in coming months. But the report offers convincing evidence that an improving trend is under way.    The Reagan administration was jubilant. &quot;I'm amazed, I'm really amazed with the export numbers jumping that much,&quot; U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said in Paris, where he is attending a meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. &quot;That's really a spectacular performance on the export side.&quot; Mr. Yeutter predicted that the deficit would narrow this year from 1987.    Treasury Secretary James Baker, who is also in Paris, said the report shows that the deficit is improving in dollar terms as well as in volume.    The report should strengthen President Reagan's hand in the coming veto battle over the trade bill. In a televised news conference yesterday, the president said he would issue his veto message in a couple of days and that the trade report &quot;emphasizes what we've been saying all along, that this is not the time to be imposing restrictions on trade or reducing incentives for free, open markets, or closing job opportunities.&quot;    On Capitol Hill, however, Democratic leaders noted that the nation's trade gap remains alarmingly wide and urged the president to sign the measure. House Speaker James Wright said that &quot;with all these monthly fluctuations the trade deficit is five times as high as it was when President Reagan came into office, and this is intolerable.&quot;    To some extent the improvement reflected seasonal factors. The last time the deficit was smaller was also for a March, when the figure was $8.14 billion in March 1985. Beginning with the deficit report for April, to be released next month, the department will adjust the figures for predictable seasonal variations. They still won't be adjusted for inflation.    Some economists also suggested the March level amounted to a correction after the unexpected swelling of the deficit in February.    &quot;Just as the month before was exaggeratedly weak, this is exaggeratedly strong,&quot; said Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. &quot;Nonetheless, we are improving.&quot;    In addition, the latest export total was buoyed by $600 million of gold bullion sent to Taiwan. In reality, that transfer just reflects Taiwan's decision to convert some of its huge dollar reserves into bullion to make its surplus with the U.S. look smaller. Asked about the Taiwanese maneuver, Mr. Yeutter said, &quot;They ought to know better.&quot;    The bond market, ever looking for a dark cloud, found it in the export surge, which was taken as an indication that the economy may be overheating and that an acceleration in inflation is under way. The report does follow other indications of a strong economy, including a drop in the unemployment rate to a 14-year low. A month ago the bond market fell sharply in response to a major deterioration in the trade gap.    Donald Straszheim, president of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. in New York, said the export boom is &quot;bad news for inflation, and that's what's making people upset.&quot; But he acknowledged, &quot;We economists are always looking for the bad news. We ought to just sit back and enjoy the number for a while. It is remarkably strong.&quot;    At any rate, as far as the trade balance is concerned, the report contained more silver lining than cloud. The deficit narrowed with the newly industrialized countries of Southeast Asia, as well as with Canada and Western Europe. It swelled slightly with Japan.    Manufactured exports rose 23.3% to $19.81 billion, with gains coming in aircraft, office machinery, power-generating machinery, cars and telecommunications equipment, among other areas.    &quot;These fabulous export numbers indicate that American high-tech and capital goods are becoming more competitive and world growth is picking up,&quot; said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers.    A 5.8% increase in manufactured imports to $30.52 billion included higher shipments of office machines, electrical equipment, aircraft, telecommunications equipment, cars and parts for motor vehicles and tractors. This rise partly reflects higher prices in response to the decline in the dollar. Some economists also said it suggests that U.S. companies are bringing in additional capital goods so they can expand and produce more exports.    The latest semiannual economic forecast by the National Association of Purchasing Management found that 53% of managers who work for companies that export say shipments increased moderately in the first half of 1988, with 12% finding exports up substantially. Orders are expected to gain further in the second half of the year.    About 20% of companies that import reported a moderate drop in shipments in the first half of 1988, while 24% indicated a moderate rise. About 28% predict a rise in imports during the rest of the year, while 21% expect fewer shipments.    The value of petroleum and related imports fell 15.2% in March to $3.24 billion from $3.82 billion. By volume, oil imports fell 11.3% to 206.3 million barrels from 232.5 million, with the average price declining to $15.70 from $16.42.    ---   Walter S.
