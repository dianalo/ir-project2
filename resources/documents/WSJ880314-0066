Richard Gephardt's fourth-place finish in the Democratic presidential primaries last week shows that his protectionist rhetoric isn't enough to win votes. But the debate on U.S. trade policy won't go away, no matter what becomes of Mr. Gephardt and the more objectionable parts of the congressional trade bill. One reason is that Mr. Gephardt was asking the right question, even if he is offering a poor answer.    The Gephardt approach would scrap the sort of product-by-product &quot;retail&quot; trade policy the U.S. is using to force open markets in places like Japan and Korea. Instead, the Gephardt amendment to the trade bill before Congress would base U.S. trade policies towards specific countries on &quot;wholesale&quot; measures of bilateral trade flows and patterns of trade barriers, and then try to resolve American complaints in an integrated, broad effort.    The problem with the Gephardt amendment is its prescription for reversing these broad-based unfavorable trade patterns. Under the Missouri Democrat's plan, the U.S. would demand an end to offending foreign trade practices, followed by mandatory retaliation to cut the violator's trade surplus 10% annually. That would only invite retaliation at a time when U.S. exports are rising and must rise further. But Mr. Gephardt's choice of a bad remedy for wholesale, bilateral trade problems doesn't invalidate the wholesale approach itself. And one reason is that even those who oppose Mr. Gephardt admit the retail approach isn't working.    &quot;I'm against the Gephardt bill,&quot; says one top Reagan administration trade official. &quot;But, privately, I'd love to find a wholesale approach. I keep asking people around here to come up with one, but we haven't been able to so far. I'm tired of visiting the Okura Hotel&quot; in Tokyo, where U.S. trade negotiators often stay.    Under the current nickel-and-dime method, squads of federal lawyers and negotiators tackle a seemingly endless series of minute problems involving specific goods or services: oranges or construction in Japan, beef, insurance, cigarettes in Korea; cooking oil or pasta in Europe.    Each issue is eventually settled, after long, exhausting talks, with a &quot;compromise&quot; that usually leaves some trade barriers in place. But there's little time to savor the &quot;victory&quot; in Washington; soon a new dispute -- perhaps involving skis or aluminum baseball bats -- emerges. Fundamental policies and market practices which block out U.S. goods remain in place.    This retail method corrodes the climate for trade and encourages protectionism by focusing intense public attention on narrow economic sectors in which foreign trade barriers get highlighted here and U.S. pressure tactics draw criticism abroad. And it persuades our trading partners that they can buy off America by sprinkling a few high-profile orders around -- like explorers offering beads to the natives -- without truly opening their markets to the free entry of U.S. goods.    For instance, when Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita visited President Reagan in January, his aides brought along a list of Japanese trade concessions to the U.S. in 1987. It boasted that, among other things, the mighty Japanese economy had managed to purchase a handful of American helicopters, to permit a few U.S. lawyers to practice in Tokyo, and to allow the printing of coupons in certain advertising.    Similarly, Taiwan mounts annual &quot;buying missions&quot; to the U.S. to place a bunch of orders and garner publicity. These road shows get good local press from grateful communities, even though there's no evidence Taiwanese customers wouldn't have bought the same quantities of U.S. goods without the trips.    &quot;The retail approach is the worst possible approach,&quot; says Clyde Prestowitz, a former Reagan administration trade official who made 60 negotiating trips to Japan between 1981 and 1986. &quot;It has no hope of touching the real issue, and you get bogged down in endless details.&quot; What's more, he says, &quot;the longer it goes on, the harder attitudes get. You may make small gains, but the atmosphere gets poisoned so you can't make the big gains you need later.&quot;    In a forthcoming book, Mr. Prestowitz argues for instituting a new system of &quot;managed trade&quot; that would apportion markets in politically sensitive goods. But there are other, less controversial ways to take trade policy wholesale.    One promising approach is the negotiation of bilateral trade agreements, sweeping away a host of tariffs and barriers at once, on the model of the recently signed U.S.Canada Free Trade Agreement now before Congress. The Canada treaty, despite its name, doesn't establish fully free trade. But it does commit each country to concrete market-opening measures across the board. And it depoliticizes trade disputes by referring them to faceless arbitrators working under tight deadlines, rather than leaving the arguments to presidents, prime ministers and cabinet members.    Treasury Secretary James Baker has hinted at this idea, and many of the presidential candidates have embraced it, proposing treaties with Japan and Mexico, among others. A new survey of top economists by Blue Chip Economic Indicators shows that a series of bilateral trade treaties modeled on the Canada pact is the trade policy option most favored by the economists for the next president to pursue.    Whoever succeeds Ronald Reagan will have to answer Mr. Gephardt's question. Four more years of retail trade policy could just make Mr. Gephardt's protectionist answer harder for voters to resist next time. </TEXT></DOC>
