(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   She once was a computer expert whohelped fight crime with TV's ``Knight Rider.'' But all RebeccaHolden ever really wanted to do was sing country music.   ``Finally, I'm getting to do what I've always wanted to do,''she said in an interview. ``I think I'm happier than I've everbeen.''   After a modeling and acting career that included a brief stinton the soap opera ``General Hospital,'' Holden has settled inNashville and is making records and music videos for Tra StarRecords.   On ``Knight Rider,'' she portrayed April Curtis, a computerexpert who helped fight crime. This led to her role as the wickedElena on ``General Hospital.''   When her soap character died, she turned to country music. She'sbeen the opening act at concerts by country stars such as LeeGreenwood, Tom T. Hall, Earl Thomas Conley and Ronnie McDowell. Sheand her four-piece band also made a concert tour of Canada.   Holden kept her hand in acting by appearing in music videos withthe Statler Brothers and Ronnie Milsap.   ``Singing is the only thing I ever wanted to do, ever,'' shesaid. ``People get the idea that I'm an actress that's now tryingto sing. That's not right. It just took me a while to make ithappen. If I'd had my druthers, that's all I would have ever done.''   Holden, raised in San Antonio, majored in piano and voice atNorth Texas State University. She had a modeling and TV career inNew York where she also put together a country music band.   ``My television career blossomed into something I neverexpected,'' she said. ``I never had dreams of television or anacting career.''   Millions saw her astride a horse in a TV commercial, carryingcologne on a tray to a waiting, handsome young man.   ``They glued the bottle to the tray,'' she recalled.   Then later, she loved the challenge of the soap opera dailygrind.   ``There is a lot of dialogue to memorize. You do 70, 80 pages aday whereas on an episodic show maybe seven or eight. The crewshave to be commended because you turn out an enormous amount ofmaterial each day,'' she said.   ``It was exciting. I loved being put to the test.''   She calls her singing style contemporary country and believesshe can broaden the base of country music.   ``There are so many good young artists out there,'' she said.``I think maybe some of the newer people coming in to an industrycan bring a new audience in. Maybe young people will hear them andsay, `Hey I like that. Is it country? I like it anyway.' Maybe I'llbe able to bring in an audience who didn't like it before.''   Holden had to pay her dues in country music just like anyoneelse, she said. ``You have to prove yourself. You can't just comeand say, `just because I was in television I'm going to be asinger.' It doesn't work that way. I wanted to prove myself, andyou have to. You have to do your share of showcases.''   Showcases are performances by singers designed to show theirtalent to record producers and others. It's this kind of performingshe enjoys most.   ``There's something about a live audience and the immediateresponse that I like,'' she said. ``There's really nothing like it;there's magic that happens that you don't get if you're working onan isolated sound stage.   ``There's a high you get from it that's unexplainable. There's afeeling of unity and togetherness from the people that's like noother.   ``When you are acting, you get that from whoever you are doingthe scene with. You get those special moments when a scene reallyworks,'' she said.   ``Another thing is that when you are acting, you always areanother character. When you are on stage, you are yourself.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, Oct. 27-29</NOTE></DOC>
