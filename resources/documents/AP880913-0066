(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 17-year-old mother accused of puttingher newborn baby inside a brown paper bag and dumping her on thesidewalk says she wants her daughter back.   The Lake Worth teen, whose name was not being released, turnedherself in Monday and faced child-abuse charges for allegedlyabandoning the baby outside an apartment complex after giving birthSaturday, said police Detective Susan Pults.   The baby was placed in the custody of the state healthdepartment and was reported in good condition Monday at St. Mary'sHospital in West Palm Beach, said hospital spokesman Don Chester.   Meanwhile, more than 20 families contacted the health departmentMonday and offered to adopt or care for the 6-pound, 2-ounce girl.   The mother told police she panicked after giving birth aboutnoon Saturday and dumped the baby ``some place where she was sureit would be found,'' said Pults. The baby was found about an hourlater by an 88-year-old woman.   The mother feared ``she would be thrown out of her house if shecame home with a baby,'' police said.   A judge will decide whether to return the infant to her teenmother, award custody to her grandparents or put the baby up foradoption, said HRS spokesman Cam Freedlund.   Police learned the mother's identity after someone called andtold them her name, Pults said.   The father of the infant was identified, but was not charged,she said.   Following the mother's arrest, she was taken to the JuvenileDetention Center in West Palm Beach and was later released into herparents' custody, police said.</TEXT></DOC>
