In four hours of public testimony on Monday night, the lines weredrawn.;    And then Tuesday, in a quiet and businesslike manner, the councilsimply sat down and voted yes. Folks around town who had tuned into the publicaccess cable channel expecting a gloves-off debate must have been throwingbeer cans at the screen.;    Next the council quickly voted 7-1 to allow theclinic to expand by 45,000 square feet, a compromise between the 65,000requested and the 35,000 recommended by the planning commission. Then it votedto limit the number of physicians the clinic could add to its staff. Again thetone was polite and conciliatory.;    By this time the fight fans werereaching for the remote to switch to professional wrestling. If they did, theymissed the show. For while the council had every intention of making itsdecisions quickly and in a reasoned way, this issue was just too volatile tocontain.;    Unraveling;  As soon as they got into the details, the processbegan to unravel. Council members made motions and countermotions, unable toagree on anything. Jack Sutorius, in the mayor's chair less than a month, grewirritable as he struggled to maintain control of the meeting. At one point hebarked at Vice Mayor Gary Fazzino for interrupting him, and everyone exchangednervous glances. After that it was clear nothing would be accomplished thatnight.;    A few minutes later Fazzino moved to adjourn and Sutorius ruled themotion out of order. The city attorney said that the motion was in order.Sutorius then asked if there was any debate. The city attorney informed himthe motion was not debatable. Reluctantly Sutorius called for a vote. Themotion passed 5-3, and everyone went home.;    For the usually dignifiedcouncil, it was not a proud moment.;    &quot;It was almost embarrassing,&quot; onecouncil member said.;    It would have been too much to expect the council toget through the evening without a little temper showing. The clinic expansionis an emotional decision for the council and for the community. Everyone intown has some stake in the outcome.;    Neighbors oppose;  The foundation andits clinic, which is a few blocks from downtown, draw patients from throughoutthe Peninsula, creating traffic and parking headaches for its Professorvilleneighbors. The neighbors want the clinic either to go away or go back to beinga community clinic. They fear the expansion will mean years of constructionand even more traffic.;    The neighbors are battling clinic patients and thebusiness community, which views the foundation, with its 750 employees and120,000 patients, as the anchor tenant of the downtown.;    For the impartialobserver, it would be difficult to choose sides. On one side are peopleprotecting their homes, the sanctity of their neighborhood. On the other arepeople concerned about their family health care and people concerned about thecity's stagnant tax base.;    There are few impartial observers in town,however, and none on the council. Like 40 percent of the people in town, MayorSutorius is a clinic patient, as are some other council members. One ofFazzino's campaigns was run by a retired clinic doctor. Council member JeanMcCown, who has a professional conflict because of her law practice, was theonly one who could legitimately bow out of the decision. I'm sure by lateTuesday night several others would have been happy to join her.;    Strongfeelings;  I can't be impartial either. Clinic doctors delivered my babies andrepaired the torn cartilage in my knee. They treated my husband's bronchitisand our children's ear infections. A cousin of mine was a foundation executivefor years before retiring recently. I know the clinic needs more space, and ifit were forced to leave town, I would panic.;    Yet I see the other side,too. Although I don't live in the immediate neighborhood, I drive by theclinic every day on my way to work. If the foundation goes ahead with itsplans, I will be inconvenienced for years by construction.;    And I knowthere are drawbacks to letting the clinic get too big. One terrible week lastyear we made three trips there with our sick daughter and saw three differentdoctors who made three different diagnoses. That week I would not have votedto let the clinic expand.;    All over town there are people like me, peoplewho have strong feelings about this issue. The council members have heard froma lot of them. They knew approving an expansion would make some people mad,but they had to weigh the benefit for the community. As one council membersaid, &quot;When you're dealing with the whole city, you can't just sit up thereand count noses.&quot;;    Round Two;  Monday night the council will reconvene forRound Two, but I doubt the fight fans will get much of a show. All week therehas been scurrying behind the scenes to work out compromises on the majorremaining issues in order to make this pill a little easier for the neighborsto swallow.;    The council is likely to settle only the broadest issues andthen allow the foundation, the architect and the neighbors to work out thedetails. The idea is to create something everyone can buy into, something thatwill work for the foundation, the neighbors and the city.;    Sutorius hopesthis can be done without rancor.;    &quot;We're talking about providing healthcare here,&quot; he said. &quot;Wouldn't it be nice if we could make this a healingprocess instead of an injury?&quot;;    That depends on your point of view.Consensus might make good public policy, but it makes lousy TV.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Patty Fisher column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910203  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,046  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday February 3, 199100034064,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
