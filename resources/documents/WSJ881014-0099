Schmitt (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> JUS </G><DATELINE> SAN FRANCISCO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal appeals court, dealing a blow to authors, musicians and other creative people, held that state governments, including universities, can reproduce copyright works without permission and avoid liability for money damages.    The decision stemmed from a 1986 lawsuit by BV Engineering Professional Software, a closely held, Riverside, Calif., company, that challenged the unauthorized copying of its software programs and other materials by physics professors at the University of California at Los Angeles.    The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, affirming a lower-court ruling, held that the suit was barred by the 11th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits suits against states in federal court. Such suits are permitted where Congress explicitly legislates them or where states have waived their immunities. But the federal appeals court held that neither exception applied to cases brought under U.S. copyright law.    In so ruling, the court overruled its own 1979 opinion allowing such suits to proceed. The court cited a 1985 U.S. Supreme Court decision that requires a higher level of proof that Congress intended to strip states of the exemption.    The question of state immunity from suits has been a knotty one for federal courts. Often, frustrated litigants have been able to obtain some relief by turning to state courts. The latest ruling, however, is particularly onerous in its effect because, as a matter of law, state judges are barred from hearing copyright issues.    The university's position had garnered the support of educational groups, which argued that copying for limited-purposes should be protected because it has broad public benefits.    BV Engineering had sold the UCLA professors single copies of seven different computer programs and their respective user manuals. The university then made several additional copies on its own. UCLA officials characterized the additional copying as an innocent attempt to evaluate the programs for further educational purposes. BV claimed the copying amounted to illegal pirating, tried unsuccessfully to negotiate a license agreement with the university, and then sued the school.    While barring money damages, the court's decision still allows plaintiffs to obtain injunctions to halt massive copying of documents or other works. Allen Wagner, a lawyer for UCLA, said such an alternative is &quot;appropriate and fair redress.&quot;    But lawyers for BV said the approach leaves the initial damage done. &quot;It gives a state one free shot to copy copyrighted material,&quot; said Leo Cunningham, a lawyer with Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich andamp; Rosati in Palo Alto, Calif., who helped to represent the software company.    Mr. Cunningham, who said the court's opinion would have &quot;far-reaching effects,&quot; said an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is planned.    The decision was similar to a Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in July that went against a photographer. </TEXT></DOC>
