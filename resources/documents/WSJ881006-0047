In an unusual move late Tuesday, Exxon Corp., a major buyer of Saudi crude, in less than a half hour chartered as many as eight supertankers to pick up oil from Saudi Arabia during October. In addition, Saudi Arabia chartered seven vessels to carry its oil to foreign markets. &quot;It shows that Saudi Arabia really is pushing out the goods,&quot; said a shipping executive familiar with the charters.    The price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell sharply soon after futures trading commenced at the New York Mercantile Exchange on a rumor that OPEC Secretary General Subroto was resigning. The rumor was denied and prices rose. But rumors -- again later denied -- that Nigeria was going to pull out of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and that OPEC President and Nigerian Oil Minister Rilwanu Lukman was going to resign his OPEC post beat prices down again.    The price for West Texas Intermediate finished trading yesterday at $12.60 a barrel, down 47 cents. Many traders and industry analysts are saying that they expect prices to slip lower. On a cautionary note, however, some market participants are growing leery of such a sudden and precipitous price drop. &quot;On any positive news, it could turn around and shoot back up,&quot; one trader said.    But, &quot;it looks like a replay of 1986 when Saudi overproduction drove the futures price to $9.75 a barrel and some Persian Gulf crudes to $6.50,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, vice president of energy investments for Prudential Bache Securities Inc.    And Lawrence Goldstein, executive vice president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, notes that the current market environment is worse than two years ago when &quot;Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Abu Dhabi together led a similar overproduction strategy.&quot; Now, he said, &quot;the whole group {OPEC} is splintered, with each member having its own objective.&quot;    Oil supplies are bountiful. A monthly report released by the International Energy Agency shows that crude oil production of 50.6 million barrels a day in the third quarter is the highest its been for that period in eight years. World-wide consumption is estimated at about 46.5 million barrels a day. The report also shows that 11 of the 13 OPEC members during that period were already pushing out more oil than their quotas allowed.    And reports circulated that during the last week of September Saudi Arabia was producing 5.6 million barrels a day, far above its daily quota of 4.3 million barrels. Further burdening the market was a report released by the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday that U.S. crude oil and gasoline inventories increased last week from levels of the previous week. Crude stocks rose 5.3 million barrels to 324.1 million barrels, while gasoline inventories climbed by 3.2 million barrels to 221.7 million barrels. Inventories for both crude and gasoline, however, remain below levels for the year-earlier period.    An individual familiar with Saudi strategy has said that the Saudis intend to maintain production at 5.6 million barrels a day through this month.    &quot;Saudi Arabia is overproducing quite publicly in an effort to bring the situation to a head; to make sure everyone's attention is riveted&quot; on declining oil prices as cartel members prepare for the joint meeting of two of its committees in two weeks as well as a meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council next week, Mr. Goldstein said.    Meanwhile, Chevron Corp., Unocal Corp., Diamond Shamrock Randamp;M Inc., Sohio, a unit of British Petroleum Co., Shell, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, cut their posted, or buying, price for crude oil $1, putting the price of crude for many large U.S. oil companies at $13 a barrel. And despite seasonal demand for home heating fuel, Venezuela, a large supplier of heating oil to the Northeast, reduced its price for that fuel five cents a gallon.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   PRECIOUS METALS: Gold traders ignored weakness in crude oil and bid precious metals futures prices higher. Gold closed above $400 for the first time in two weeks. October delivery gold ended at $400.80 an ounce, for a gain of $2.70. The last time the spot position closed above $400 was Sept. 20 when September settled at $405.30. December gold was up $2.60 an ounce at $405.30. December silver advanced five cents an ounce to $6.3850, while January platinum rose 80 cents an ounce to $510.60. According to one analyst, Bernard Savaiko of New York-based PaineWebber Inc., the recent persistent liquidation created an oversold condition that made prices attractive to bargain hunters. That's why, he said, the October contract found support at the $395 level on the downside and then recovered to break above $400, regarded as a key resistance point. He said the action in gold struck a very positive note. &quot;If it didn't go down on bad news (oil falling) what can it do on good news?&quot; he said. Mr. Savaiko said some of the buying of futures was by banks and dealers. Another analyst said there had been a slight pickup in demand for gold and silver bullion, but added, &quot;It's still too soon to say the market has turned.&quot;    COPPER: Futures prices continued setting new life-of-contract highs in all deliveries except July 1989. The soon-to-expire October contract traded as high as $1.20 a pound before ending at $1.1990 for a gain of 1.65 cents. December settled at $1.1090 a pound, up 0.95 cent, after trading as high as $1.1170. Ben Hanauer, of Rudolf Wolff andamp; Co., New York metals brokers, said commodity funds trading on computer-generated signals were sellers early in the session but later turned around and became buyers. Mr. Hanauer said he had heard rumors that a significant amount of copper had been withdrawn from warehouses of the London Metal Exchange and was on its way to the U.S. &quot;As I understand it, this copper has already been sold and won't be tendered against the October contract on the Commodity Exchange in New York,&quot; he said. Michael Frawley, a trader for PaineWebber Inc., New York, said the copper in question amounted to about 20,000 tons and was destined for buyers. The flow of copper to New York from London isn't surprising because of the hefty premium that the physical metal is commanding in New York. According to one analyst, cash market copper sells for as much as 5 1/2 cents over the October future; it costs about 2 1/4 cents a pound to ship copper to New York from London, he said.    COCOA: Futures prices extended Tuesday's advances. The December contract rose $61 a metric ton to $1,228. Active buying of contracts by traders who previously sold short, anticipating price declines, drove prices higher, an analyst said. A substantial amount of cocoa beans was sold recently by the Ivory Coast, the analyst said. &quot;Apparently, the manner in which the market absorbed the large quantity, estimated at about 200,000 tons, has encouraged demand for futures contracts,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
