With Iraqi troops entrenched in Kuwait, with oil pricesrising at neighborhood gasoline pumps across the U.S., andwith the new threat of an economic recession just before themid-term congressional elections, President Bush faces aseries of decisions that will color the rest of his term andhelp determine whether he wins another one.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The president is going into a dark room now, and we don'tknow what is going to happen,&quot; says John Geer, a politicalscientist at Arizona State University. &quot;This could be anopportunity for him, but on the whole, this is the kind ofopportunity a president would rather not have.&quot;   Eight years ago, Margaret Thatcher faced a similardefining moment when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands.She responded forcefully, won back the Falklands,consolidated her position atop the greasy pole of Britishpolitics and won for herself a reputation as a tough primeminister willing to use force to protect British interests.   Mr. Bush's problem is much tougher than Mrs. Thatcher's,however. The U.S. is a third party but has critical economicand diplomatic stakes in a crisis that involves amilitaristic head of the world's sixth largest standing army.Mr. Bush's options, all of which almost certainly wouldprovoke enormous unintended consequences in a world hot spot,are far more difficult.   Although he has racked up impressively high poll ratingsafter 19 months of office, his persona isn't etched verydeeply with the public; it's difficult for voters to identifyhis fingerprints on the government. Whatever his actions inthe next several days and weeks, it is clear that thechallenge from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein will have aprofound effect on the way Americans view Mr. Bush.   &quot;Three months from now we will have a very good sense ofGeorge Bush,&quot; says Peter Hart, a Democratic politicalpollster. &quot;He'll either look strong or he will have begun theslide down the slippery slope of public opinion.&quot; EdwardRollins, co-chairman of the National Republican CongressionalCommittee, adds: &quot;This is the big moment.&quot;   In the first diplomatic crisis of the post-Cold Warperiod, Mr. Bush's problem is to protect U.S. interestsbroadly -- not only economic interests at home, but importantgeopolitical interests in the Middle East and Europe. Heraised the stakes himself when he said of the Iraqi invasionof Kuwait, &quot;This will not stand&quot; and urged the world to watchfor his actions.   For more than a year and a half, Mr. Bush has benefitedfrom events over which he had little control; he was on thesidelines, for example, as Communist Eastern Europe crumbledwith unexpected speed and ease. Now events under which he hadno control are moving against him, forcing him to takeaction.   &quot;This is a watershed in the Bush presidency,&quot; says BurtonYale Pines, senior vice president of the Heritage Foundation,a conservative think tank here in Washington. &quot;He has got toshow that he and his people are beginning to understand thepost-Cold War world and how to use America's levers ofinfluence and power in that environment. It does notnecessarily mean going to war, but it means that you have tobe prepared to go to war. It also means we don't go to waralone.&quot;   Mr. Bush is contemplating his strategy in a politicalatmosphere that demands a swift display of resolve if notactual action.   &quot;If Bush just lets this drag out, it will hurt him,&quot; saysWilliam Hamilton, a Democratic political pollster. &quot;Peoplewill see an effect at the gas pumps, and if there are realworries about a recession, they'll be blamed on Bush. Thismay be the most important week of the Bush presidency. Peopleare looking for a strong lead from the president.&quot;   The crisis comes at a time when some of the familiar buoysof diplomacy have moved, and Mr. Bush knows that he can actto protect U.S. allies in Saudi Arabia and protect U.S. oilsupplies without worrying as much about a countermove fromthe Soviet Union. Although that gives Mr. Bush some moremaneuvering room, he is still feeling his way in a newrelationship with the Soviets.   &quot;During the whole Cold War, the threat was that trouble inthe Middle East could escalate into a war between the U.S.and the Soviet Union,&quot; says John Mueller, a University ofRochester political scientist. &quot;In this crisis there isn'tthat danger, but there's the challenge of defining a newrelationship that could be quite productive with theSoviets.&quot;   Mr. Bush also faces a challenge not met fully by anyAmerican president since Harry Truman: uniting the world'sdemocracies and others in a common goal. &quot;That's Bush'spotential mission,&quot; says James David Barber, a DukeUniversity expert on the presidency. &quot;In the past, he hastaken on major missions: going into the service despite theobjections of his father, taking off for Texas, going toBeijing. This may be his presidential mission.&quot;   Mr. Bush is contemplating his response in the knowledgethat, in the short term at least, he acts with the support ofcongressional leaders. &quot;We're in the immediaterally-round-the-flag moment,&quot; says Stephen Hess of theBrookings Institution. &quot;There is nothing especially Bushabout his response: meeting with advisers, looking toward theUnited Nations. By Labor Day, we'll know more about the Bushstyle.&quot;   If the result is a protracted stalemate, an unsuccessfulmilitary mission or high loss of life, the president'ssupport could evaporate quickly.   House Speaker Thomas Foley yesterday repeated that hewould &quot;support the use of military force if necessary toprotect Saudi Arabia&quot; but cautioned that the struggle withIraq might involve tactics like boycotts and blockades thatwould take more time than a swift military strike and thatmight call for economic sacrifices from energy consumers inthe U.S.   &quot;If there are risks,&quot; the Washington Democrat said, &quot;it isthat we won't be patient enough, not determined enough.&quot;   Before the crisis is over, it's clear that the public'sperception of Mr. Bush will be less an impressionism sketchand more a realism portrait.   &quot;Everybody's been looking for a defining moment in theBush presidency,&quot; says Thomas Griscom, who served ascommunications director in the Reagan White House. &quot;Hischallenge here is to take a decisive step.&quot;   &quot;He has to act like a president,&quot; concurs HarrisonHickman, a Democratic political consultant. &quot;This is as closeto it as it gets.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
