Late Monday, the hurricane was moving west at 20 mph severalhundred miles east-southeast of Hawaii Island, according to theNational Weather Service. Its maximum sustained wind speed was 75mph, with gusts up to 90 mph.   At that speed and course, the hurricane was expected to passabout 150 miles south of Hawaii Island tonight. However, the weatherservice said a slight change in direction would bring the hurricanecloser to the state.   ``Storms have a mind of their own,'' said lead forecaster HansRosendal. ``We've put out a tropical storm watch in case Daliliastrays from the path.''   The weather watch issued Monday afternoon warned residents that73 mph winds, large waves and heavy rain could hit the island, hesaid. It was issued only for the island of Hawaii.   An Air Force reconaissance plane from Keesler Air Force Base inBiloxi, Miss., was scheduled to fly through the storm Tuesday tocollect data on its intensity and direction, according to theCentral Pacific Hurricane Center here.   Dal said it was too early to predict with certainty how Daliliawould affect Hawaii's weather.   ``It depends how close it comes,'' he said. ``There wouldprobably at least be some heavy rain and high surf on the BigIsland. It's too early to say about Oahu and the rest of the state.''</TEXT></DOC>
