The apparatus consists of: (a) a substantiallycylindrical housing; (b) a positioning means mounted on a portion ofthe housing; (c) a circular platform disposed adjacent to the housing,a plurality of cam followers mounted symmetrically around the platform.The cam followers having contact surfaces substantially parallel to thetop surface of the platform; (d) a substantially rigid connecting memberjoining the positioning means to the platform; (e) an ultrasonic transducingmeans for transmitting ultrasonic waves in response to a first electricalsignal and receiving echoes of the ultrasonic waves and converting themto a second electrical signal; the transducing means mounted proximatea portion of the arcuate edge of the platform and projecting radiallyfrom the edge; the housing being removably engageable to the drill collarcoupling whereby the contact surfaces of the cam followers contact themouth of the coupling rotatably supporting the platform thereupon.</TEXT></DOC>
