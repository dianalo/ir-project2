In December 1985, a plant owned by Shri Ram Foods andamp; Fertilizer Industries Ltd. leaked a mixture of sulphuric acid and sulphur trioxide, killing one person and injuring several others.    The court, India's highest, ruled that Shri Ram was responsible for the leak. The judgment set a major precedent and sparked a legal battle here by stating that companies manufacturing hazardous or &quot;inherently dangerous&quot; products have an absolute responsibility, which cannot by delegated, for ensuring the safety of their plants and products, no matter who or what is responsible for an accident.    Lawyers following the case say the Shri Ram ruling could have a major impact on U.S.-based Union Carbide Corp. A pesticides plant operated in Bhopal by the company's Union Carbide India Ltd., a 50.9%-owned subsidiary, leaked deadly gas during the night of Dec. 2-3, 1984, killing more than 2,000 people and seriously injuring 30,000 to 40,000 people in what has been called the world's worst industrial disaster.    The ruling, written by Chief Justice P.N. Bhagwati Dec. 20, the day before he retired, further stated that compensation should be guided by the company's ability to pay, as opposed to the previous practice of determining compensation by the earning capacity of the victims.    A Union Carbide spokesman said the new rules established in the case did not apply to the Danbury, Conn., chemical giant, reiterating company claims that its Indian unit is a separate business with an arms-length relationship with its parent.    &quot;The rules are very extreme and without precedent in the entire world, which we believe is likely to result in the Indian Supreme Court reconsidering,&quot; the Union Carbide spokesman said. &quot;The rules seek to establish liability for events obviously not preventable, such as acts of God and deliberate acts of sabotage.&quot;    Under Indian law, there is no appeal of a Supreme Court judgment, but last month lawyers for Shri Ram sought &quot;a judicial review&quot; of the finding and further asked a two-man Supreme Court panel that parts of the December decision be expunged because they are &quot;wrong in law.&quot; Their request for a review is scheduled to be heard later this month.    The Indian government, representing the Bhopal victims, has already petitioned a Bhopal district court to accept an application for a quick decision, based in part on the principles of &quot;strict and absolute liability&quot; set down by the Shri Ram case.    Arguments on the application had been set for late February. However, the district judge who had been hearing the Bhopal case, G.S. Patel, was replaced last month following a disclosure that he was on a list of Bhopal gas claimants. The new judge, M.W. Deo, was scheduled this week to give a new date for arguments.    Lawyers for the Indian government will attempt to argue a theory they call &quot;multinational enterprise liability,&quot; under which Carbide must assume responsibility for its subsidiaries and affiliates.    The Indian government has sued Carbide on behalf of the victims for damages that the government says will exceed $3 billion.    Lawyers following the Shri Ram and Bhopal cases say that under the guidelines of the judgment, Carbide could be held responsible for the Bhopal leak, regardless of the cause. Carbide has argued that the accident was caused by sabotage. &quot;Union Carbide, which appears to be assiduously building up the defense of sabotage in the Bhopal case, may now have the rug pulled from under its feet,&quot; says Maja Daruwalla, a lawyer and legal-affairs commentator.    Many legal observers believe that both the Shri Ram judgment and the subsequent application for a review were made with Bhopal in mind. Former Chief Justice Bhagwati, however, denies any link. </TEXT></DOC>
