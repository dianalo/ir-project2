SchlesingerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/14/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> F LABORAUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) </IN><DATELINE> DEARBORN, Mich.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ford Motor Co. has tentatively accepted in principle the United Auto Workers union's request to guarantee a fixed number of jobs at every U.S. plant, sources close to national contract negotiations said.    But a half dozen serious sticking points remained early last night, the sources added, as negotiators tried to beat the strike deadline of midnight EDT tonight. The points all focused on how many loopholes -- or how much &quot;flexibility&quot; to cut employment rolls -- the company will get in the three-year contract.    The hurdles include the union's demands that the company replace every worker who leaves and that the jobs be guaranteed regardless of what happens to Ford's sales. It isn't clear yet what trade-offs the union may have agreed to, although the company wants more-flexible work rules in its plants. The sources said that the differences were still large enough that any agreement in principle could &quot;become unglued.&quot;    &quot;They're resisting changing the fundamental way they do business,&quot; one union official said. &quot;But change is exactly what we want.&quot; Job security is the union's top priority in these negotiations.    An outright guaranteed employment level would contrast with the job-security approach the parties agreed to in 1984. In that contract, the union accepted a program that protected individuals whose jobs disappear because of technology, productivity improvements and certain other reasons. But the company didn't guarantee a certain number of jobs.    Both sides made only terse public comments over the weekend. &quot;Job security has indeed been the main area we've been wrestling with, and our differences there are still pretty serious,&quot; UAW President Owen Bieber said in a brief news conference late yesterday afternoon. &quot;Our patience is obviously wearing thin as the clock ticks away,&quot; Mr. Bieber added. &quot;I hope that we can make it, but we do have problems.&quot;    While the problems may be serious, such pessimistic rhetoric is common as a contract expiration nears, if only to show the rank-and-file that the leadership is bargaining hard for the best possible contract.    Meanwhile, a top Ford executive said late yesterday that &quot;the mechanics (of ensuring job security) are a very difficult issue.&quot; Peter J. Pestillo, the Ford vice president overseeing the negotiations, said he could &quot;be reported as optimistic&quot; of reaching a settlement before tonight's deadline. But he added: &quot;What are the odds? A tightly guarded secret.&quot;    One union official said that discussions on wages and benefits were &quot;on hold&quot; last night pending resolution of job-security issues.    Many U.S. labor unions have pushed for the concept of a stable employment base in recent years. The auto negotiations often set a precedent for other industries, so a strong endorsement by Ford could have ripple effects throughout the economy. Ford has cut U.S. employment over the past decade from 190,000 to 104,000, mainly by reducing the portion of car parts it makes and buying more from outside suppliers, and by increasing the amount of overtime at its plants.    Ford's extensive factory overtime may make it possible for the company to guarantee employment, even during a sales drop. Ford workers currently average 50-hour weeks, the UAW says, leading some union officials to estimate the company could have a 20% fall in sales and still guarantee employment.    Industry analysts and union officials across Ford's 89 U.S. facilities have long felt that Ford could settle without a strike, because its high profits and lean operations make it relatively easy to satisfy union demands. Ford has also had smoother relations with the union than General Motors Corp., where negotiations are on hold pending a Ford agreement. Chrysler Corp.'s U.S. contract doesn't expire until next year.    But the dynamics of bargaining can produce strikes even where quick settlements seem likely. A strike could quickly crimp Ford's record sales and profits. At the end of August, Ford had only a 51-day supply of cars and a 53-day supply of trucks in inventory, while 60-65 days is considered normal. However, a selective strike against key plants, which is one of the union's options, could reduce the impact.    A companywide strike would cost Ford each week about $180 million in earnings, or 70 cents a share, estimates Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities Inc. John V. Kirnan of Kidder Peabody andamp; Co. projects a weekly loss of $140 million, or 54 cents a share.    As previously reported, Ford's net income for the first half of 1987 rose 65% to $2.99 billion, or $11.54 a share, from $1.81 billion, or $6.72 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 17% to $37.64 billion from $32.09 billion.    Workers also stand to lose more than ever from a strike. The average Ford assembly worker last year made about $2,100 in profit sharing in addition to $39,000 in wages, cost-of-living adjustments and overtime. Profit-sharing checks are expected to be higher this year -- unless a strike cuts profits.    Before the 1984 walkout at GM, the last Big Three strike was in 1976, a 28-day walkout at Ford.    After reaching a contract at Ford, the UAW will try to get a similar pact at GM. Officials at the No. 1 auto maker, however, have said repeatedly that they need a different contract because it makes more parts internally than Ford. </TEXT></DOC>
