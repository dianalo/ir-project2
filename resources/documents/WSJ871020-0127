The customers are doing well; in fact, many even made money yesterday.    Stock prices on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange are rising and many stocks selected by these brokers are climbing on the Stockholm and Tokyo exchanges, even though those markets as a whole are dropping as the U.S. market tumbles. In the past two weeks, among stocks these international firms' brokers are selecting, Japan Air Lines' price has climbed 12% on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Lydenburg Platinum Ltd. is up 9% on the Johannesburg and London exchanges, and Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget is up 5% in Stockholm.    Certain U.S. firms and a number of mutual funds often use such foreign stocks to protect the value of their stock market portfolio when the U.S. market turns sour, explains Mario Murialdo, vice president of international equities trading for Goldman Sachs andamp; Co., New York.    &quot;There is a big demand right now,&quot; he says.    Since these U.S. investors buy foreign stocks as a hedge, they want issues that are untainted by too many U.S. shares. The blue-chip international brokers are buying the foreign shares right in the U.S. OTC market, mostly over the National Association of Securities Dealers' automated quotation system, or Nasdaq. But to find big international issues with only a fraction of their stock in the U.S., the brokers seek out-of-the-way foreign issues, most so remote here their prices aren't even quoted in &quot;OTC Additional&quot; listings in U.S. newspapers.    Most are ADRs, or American depository receipts, which are issued to trade in U.S. dollars by banks that hold the actual foreign shares in trust. Some 125 ADR issues trade on Nasdaq or the exchanges just like other U.S. stocks. &quot;This is the most practical way to buy foreign stock,&quot; says Mr. Murialdo, explaining that Goldman Sachs buys ADRs for its mutual-fund customers so they can move freely in and out of the shares.    From the brokers' standpoint, the best choices for hedging a plunge in the U.S. market are big domestic foreign issues such as Japan Airlines, Dai Ei Inc., a large Japanese grocery chain, and Tokio Marine andamp; Fire Insurance Co. These stocks not only trade mostly in Japan, but the companies do most of their business there.    In Sweden, the brokers favor Svenska Cellulosa, the nation's biggest paper producer. &quot;There is a very limited stock float in this issue in the U.S. compared with Sweden,&quot; says George Adler, a vice president at Smith Barney andamp; Co. &quot;I don't think U.S. investors could have any effect on the Stockholm price,&quot; he adds.    The heaviest buying by these brokers right now is in the 15 big South African gold, diamond and platinum mining issues, and related stocks such as Minerals andamp; Resources Ltd., or Minorco, the Luxembourg-based investment company, and Free States Consolidated Mines Ltd. of South Africa, which have mining investments.    Prices of these gigantic ADRs, which trade in near obscurity on Nasdaq, are benefiting in two ways from the U.S. market collapse. They move independently of the U.S. market because more of their shares trade elsewhere; and gold stocks, generally, climb in price when interest rates rise, which is just what kicked off this latest U.S. stock-selling spree.    Yesterday, for example, Free States Consolidated rose $2.125 a share in Nasdaq trading to $17.625, up 10%. Such gains, however, did little to curb the price collapse on Nasdaq yesterday, because the big South African ADRs, like most of the out-of-the-way foreign issues favored by the international brokers, aren't included in the Nasdaq indexes.    ---              Rising Foreign ADR-Stocks on Nasdaq                (Price gains so far this month)    Issue                       % Increase      Headquarters    Japan Air Lines                 +12           (Japan)    Free State Cons.                 11          (S.
