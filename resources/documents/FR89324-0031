This proposed IRPS has been designed to address the entirerange of charter-related activities_new charters, field of membership expansions,name changes, mergers and spin-offs, and charter conversions. It is intendedto integrate and replace IRPS 84-1, a 1980 NCUA manual entitled ``Charteringand Organizing Manual for Federal Credit Unions,'' a 1985 NCUA pamphletentitled ``Chartering andamp; Organizing of Federal Credit Unions,'' theNCUA Board's decisions on chartering issues made in November 1988, andall other previous NCUA statements on these matters. As finally approved,it will be published as a manual, with a preface describing the backgroundand history of credit unions and an appendix setting forth a revised listof type of membership codes for use in gathering statistical information.In addition, NCUA is proposing to update andSection; 701.1 of its Rules andRegulations entitled ``Organizing a Federal credit union'' so that it referencesthe proposed IRPS.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received by May 23, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Send comments to Becky Baker, Secretary, NCUA Board,National Credit Union Administration 1776 G Street NW., Washington, DC20456.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>H. Allen Carver, Regional Director,Region IV (Chicago), 300 Park Blvd., Suite andplusmin;155, Itasca, Illinois60143, or telephone: (312) 250-6000.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The proposed IRPS generally followsexisting policies and procedures as set forth in previous publicationsor as practiced by NCUA staff. However, there were a number of importantareas not expressly covered in previous NCUA policy statements where inconsistenciesin staff practice were discovered or where public understanding of NCUA'sexisting policies and procedures was unclear. Also found were areas wherechange may be appropriate. The principal proposed clarifications, reemphases,or changes are:<ITAG tagnum="84">I. New Charters</ITAG>A. Occupational Common Bond RequirementsThis category would be limited to employees of a person or entity and topersons who regularly work under contract for that person or entity. Personsworking at an industrial park or in a shopping center would not qualifyas a single occupational group, since they have different employers. Anapplication from such a group would be considered, at the option of theapplicant, under NCUA's community or multiple group policies.B. Associational Common Bond RequirementsThe proposal would clarify the minimum activities for an association tobe recognized as having a sufficient commonality of interest to satisfyNCUA's common bond: At least one meeting annually which is open to allnatural person members; sponsorship of other activities providing for regularcontact among natural person members; and an authoritative definition ofwho is eligible for membership.The proposal would also reemphasize NCUA's longstanding policy of charteringassociationally-based charters at the lowest economically feasible level.An associational charter would have this geographic service area definedin the field of membership unless its constitution and bylaws limited thegeographic area.The proposal would clarify the Agency's position with respect to chambersof commerce and other similarly-structured associations, as directed bythe NCUA Board last November. A charter application for employees of achamber of commerce is treated like any other occupational group application.However, NCUA generally does not grant a charter for the members of suchan association unless they are primarily natural persons. And even then,nonnatural persons are generally excluded. Finally, employees of a chamberof commerce's members are not considered to have a sufficient tie to theassociation to be included in its common bond.The proposal would also emphasize that a client or customer relationship_e.g.,an insurance company's or buyers club's customers_does not give a sufficientlyclose tie to the group to satisfy the common bond requirement. Dependingon the particular circumstances, rural electric cooperatives and home owners'or tenants' associations may be sufficiently close-knit to have a recognizablecommon bond.The proposal would give special guidance to loosely-knit, newly-formed,and widely-dispersed (particularly national) organizations. Though longused by NCUA staff in practice, this guidance has not previously been putin written form.C. Chartering ProceduresThe proposal would maintain the established guideline for a Federal creditunion charter at 500 potential members. Charter subscribers, officials,and employees of proposed Federal credit unions would undergo credit andbackground investigations, and a mandatory NCUA on-site investigation wouldbe required for all Federal credit union charter applications. The proposalwould note that cross regional associational charters and field of membershipexpansions would generally require special review within the Agency.Finally, in accordance with the NCUA Board's directive in November 1988,all charter investigation forms would be consolidated and updated. Draftforms are included in the proposal. Office of Management and Budget approvalfor the forms is being sought.D. Economic AdvisabilityIn November 1988, the NCUA Board directed the charter applicants be requiredto prepare and submit a business plan. The proposal would provide morespecific guidance on what would have to be included in that plan. Also,the membership survey to be completed by any group applying for a Federalcredit union charter would be expanded to require polling of at least 250potential members.Generalized exclusionary clauses would be prohibited under the proposedIRPS; the use of even well-defined exclusionary clauses would be avoidedwhenever possible.E. Appropriateness of Federal Credit Union NameRecently NCUA has received an increased number of questions about limitson credit union names. Since the basic document naming a Federal creditunion is its charter, the proposal includes guidance on this subject aswell. For example, the policy prohibiting duplicate use of a Federal creditunion name would be restated. The proposal would also remind applicantsthat Federal credit union names may not infringe on the trade names ofother entities.F. Letters of Understanding and AgreementNCUA has traditionally used such letters, with a sunset provision, to helpthe management of a new Federal charter focus on what the Agency has foundfrom experience are the keys to success_developing an atmosphere of serviceto members, instituting proper accounting and management procedures, providingan attractive source of savings and credit for members, and generally engenderingmember trust. The proposed IRPS would enable new charter applicants toplan for these letters from the outset and to avoid possible surprise anddelay later. A sample letter of understanding and agreement would be included.G. Appeal RightsCharter applicants would be advised in writing of their right to appealto the NCUA Board an adverse decision made by a regional director.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Field of Membership Additions</ITAG>This proposal would carry forward existing field of membership additionpolicies, with only slight modification:A. Additions Within a Common BondThe proposal would clarify the circumstances in which a Federal creditunion may obtain a geographic expansion of a common bond included in itsexisting field of membership_for example, where a credit union wishes toexpand to include employees of a business listed in its field of membershipbut working at a plant not presently within the field of membership.B. Community-Based Federal Credit Union ExpansionsIn November 1988, the NCUA Board broadened its delegation to the RegionalDirectors to permit approval of community Federal credit union expansionswhere the resulting community's population does not exceed 50,000 or theexpansion would not add more than 30 percent to the credit union's fieldof membership. Given this expanded delegation, community-based chartersmay no longer need the power to add select groups within a larger well-definedcommunity to their fields of membership without expanding their boundaries.For that reason, the proposal has deleted this option.C. Service Status ReportsOne area in which there has been substantial diversity among the regionshas been in periodically requiring service status reports from credit unionsexpanding to serve new groups. The purpose of these reports is to determinewhether the expanding credit union has been successful in serving the addedgroups, and to use the information in making future decisions_e.g., inpermitting overlaps or granting additional field of membership expansions.The proposal would expressly state the NCUA Board's support for requiringthese reports as deemed appropriate by the regional directors.D. Addition ProceduresThe proposal would make explicit NCUA's longstanding policy of processingfield of membership addition requests expenditiously with a goal of tenworking days from receipt of a completed package. It would also clarifythe NCUA will usually approve field of membership expansions only for Federalcredit unions being operated in a satisfactory manner.To ensure consistency in the Regions and to eliminate risk of uncertainty,all credit unions would receive a complete, updated recitation of Section5 of their charter (field of membership) with each approved addition.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Mergers and Spin-offs</ITAG>A. Mergers of Troubled Credit UnionsThe proposal would restate the NCUA Board's decision made in November 1988that a community credit union suffering such severe financial difficultiesthat it will become insolvent within six months if some action is not takenmay merge with another Federal credit union within that Federal creditunion's operational area without regard to normal field of membership requirements.The proposal would also reemphasize that a credit union to be merged underNCUA's emergency merger authority (12 U.S.C. 1785(h)) can take place withoutregard to <T3>any</T3> field of membership restrictions.B. Spin-offsTransactions in which new or existing credit unions propose to acquirea portion of the loans, shares, and capital of other credit unions_``spin-offs''_havebeen largely deregulated. This proposal does not suggest re-regulation;it would simply make explicit the steps which must be followed under NCUA'sexisting regulatory structure.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Purchases and Assumptions</ITAG>The proposal would clarify a portion of IRPS 84-1 dealing with continuingservice to the field on membership of a credit union being liquidated.In the context of a negotiated purchase and assumption agreement betweenNCUA as liquidating agent and a Federal credit union, the credit unioncould acquire the entire field of membership of the liquidated credit unionalong with the loans, shares and certain other designated assets and liabilities,without regard to field of membership expansion restrictions and withoutchanging the character of the credit union for purposes of future fieldof membership expansions. For example, an occupationally-based Federalcredit union, as part of a purchase and assumption agreement, would beable to expand its field of membership to include that of a liquidated,community-based credit union, and to maintain its status as an occupationally-basedcredit union for purposes of future field of membership addition requests.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Conversions</ITAG>Chapter 3 of the proposal would set out the policy approved by the NCUABoard in November 1988 that State credit unions coverting to a Federalcharter must conform to Federal chartering requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Proposed Section 701.1_Organizing a Federal Credit Union.</ITAG>Section 701.1 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations currently is entitled ``Organizinga Federal credit union'' and refers those interested in forming a Federalcredit union to chapter 6 of the 1980 Chartering and Organizing Manual.It also sets forth how applicants will be notified if a charter applicationor amendment is denied. Since the proposed IRPS will replace the 1980 Manualand will address the entire range of chartering and field of membershipactivities, it is proposed that andSection;701.1 be renamed ``Federal creditunion chartering, field of membership modifications, and conversions''and merely set forth a reference to the IRPS. When the IRPS is adoptedin final form, it will be incorporated into the NCUA Rules and Regulationsby reference.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Regulatory Flexibility ActThe NCUA Board has determined and certifies that changes to NCUA policyresulting from adoption of this proposed IRPS would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small credit unions; any resultingchanges would be directed at clarification of existing policy rather thanat creation of new restrictions. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysisis not required.Paperwork Reduction ActNCUA is seeking approval from the Office of Management and Budget for alladditional paperwork requirements proposed in this IRPS.Executive Order 12612Any change in policy resulting from this proposed IRPS would not affectState regulation of credit unions.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 701</ITAG>Credit union, Field of membership, Chartering, Field of membership addition,Mergers, Conversions.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the National Credit Union Administration on March 17, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Becky Baker,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary, NCUA Board.</ITAG>Accordingly, NCUA proposes to amend 12 CFR Part 701 and to establish thefollowing IRPS:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 701_ORGANIZATION AND OPERATION OF FEDERAL CREDIT UNIONS</ITAG>1.

Copiesof the IRPS can be obtained from the National Credit Union Administration,Washington, DC, 20456.3. NCUA proposes the following Interpretive Ruling and Policy Statement.<ITAG tagnum="74">Proposed Interpretative Ruling and Policy Statement</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Chapter 1_Federal Credit Union Chartering</ITAG>I. Goals of NCUA Chartering PolicyNCUA's chartering policies are directed toward achieving three goals: A. To uphold the provisions of the Federal Credit Union Act concerninggranting Federal charters; B. To promote credit union safety and soundness; and C. To make quality credit union service available to all those who wishto have it.II. Who May Apply for a Federal Credit Union Charter NCUA may grant a charter to any group where it finds:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The group possesses a recognizable and appropriate common bond; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The subscribers are of good character and are fit to represent thegroup; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Establishment of the credit union is economically advisable_i.e.,it will be a viable institution and its chartering will not materiallyaffect the interests of other credit unions or the credit union system.</ITAG>Generally, these are the only criteria NCUA will look to. In unusual circumstances,however, NCUA may consider other factors, such as other Federal law orpublic policy in deciding if a charter should be approved.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Common Bond </ITAG>Congress has recognized three types of Federal credit union common bonds:occupational, associational, and community. A Federal credit union mayalso consist of a combination of occupational and associational groups_for example, NCUA may charter a Federal credit union consisting of employeesof a local school district and members of a church group. Individual groupshave their own common bond. All of the groups belonging to one particularcredit union (i.e., listed in Section 5 of the credit union's charter)make up the credit union's field of membership.If the charter is granted, the Federal credit union will only be able togrant loans and provide services to persons within the groups defined inthe charter. If the Federal credit union later wishes to add persons toits field of membership, it must submit a charter amendment request toNCUA in accordance with the procedures set forth in Chapter 2. 1. <T3>Occupational Common Bond.</T3> NCUA has limited this common bond andto employment by the same enterprise. Persons sharing this common bondmay be geographically dispersed. Employees of a parent corporation andits wholly-owned subsidiaries and persons under contract to work regularlyfor an enterprise may be considered under a single occupational bond. Eachcategory to be served (e.g., subsidiaries, contractors) must be separatelylisted. Persons with different employers, even if closely related geographically_personsworking at a single shopping center, industrial park, or office building,for example_are not treated as having a single common bond, but will beconsidered under NCUA's community or multiple-group charter policies. All occupational common bonds will include a geographic definition: e.g.,``employees, officials, and persons who work under contract regularly forABC Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, who work in Miami, Florida.''Other acceptable geographic definitions are: ``employees * * * who arepaid from * * *'' or ``employees * * * who are supervised from * * *.''The employer may also be included in this common bond_e.g., ``ABC Corporationand its subsidiaries.'' The employer will be defined in the last clausedescribing the group.Some examples of occupational group definitions are: a. ``Employees of the Scott Manufacturing Company who work in Chester,Pennsylvania * * *.'' b. ``Employees and elected and appointed officials of municipal governmentin Parma, Ohio * * *.'' c. ``Employees of Johnson Soap Company and its majority-owned subsidiary,Johnson Toothpaste Company, who work in Augusta and Portland, Maine * **.'' d. ``Personnel of fleet units of the U.S. Navy home ported at Mayport,Florida * * *.'' e. ``Civilian and military personnel of the U.S. Government who work orare stationed at, or are attached or assigned to Fort Belvoir, Virginia,or those who are retired from, or their dependents or dependent survivorswho are eligible by law or regulations to receive and are receiving benefitsor services from, that military installation * * *.''f. ``Employees of these contractors who work regularly at U.S. Naval Shipyardin Bremerton, Washington * * *.''  g. ``Employees, doctors, medical staff, technicians, medical and nursingstudents who work at Boston Medical Center at the locations stated: * **.'' h. ``Employees and teachers who work for the School District Number 3 inAustin, Texas * * *.'' Some examples of insufficiently defined occupational groups are: a. ``Employees of engineering firms in Seattle, Washington.'' (No commonemployer; names of firms must be stated; however, may be the basis fora multiple group.) b. ``Persons employed or working in Chicago, Illinois.'' (No common employer;names of firms must be stated.) c. ``Persons working in the entertainment industry in California.'' (Nocommon employer; names of firms must be stated.) 2. <T3>Associational Common Bonds. </T3>NCUA limits this common bond to groupsconsisting primarily of individuals (natural persons) who participate inactivities developing common loyalties, mutual benefits, and mutual interests.Qualifying associational groups must hold meetings open to all naturalperson members at least once a year, must sponsor other activities providingfor contact among natural person members, and must have an authoritativedefinition of who is eligible for membership_usually, this will be theassociation's constitution and bylaws. The clarity of the associationalgroup's definition and compactness of its membership will be importantcriteria in reviewing the application. NCUA policy is to organize associationalcharters at the lowest organizational level which is economically feasible.Student groups constitute an associational common bond and may qualifyfor a Federal credit union charter. Associations formed primarily to obtain a credit union charter do not havea sufficient associational common bond; nor do associations based on aclient or customer relationship_an insurance company's customers or a buyer'sclub, for example. NCUA normally charters associational Federal credit unions consisting ofnatural person members. In certain instances, NCUA will allow nonnaturalpersons (e.g. corporate sponsor or organizations of members) to be eligiblefor membership. Moreover, the common bond extends only to the association's members. Theemployees of a member of a local chamber of commerce, for example, do nothave a sufficiently close tie to the association to be included. A proposalto include these persons among those to be served by the Federal creditunion will be considered as a multiple-group charter application. Homeowner associations, tenant groups, electric co-ops, consumer groupsand other groups of persons having an ``interest in'' a particular causeand certain consumer cooperatives may be eligible to receive a Federalcharter; however, they must make a strong showing of common activitiesand economic viability. Newly-organized associations must make a similarshowing; experience has shown that a new group's efforts are best focusedon solidifying member interest before attempting to offer credit unionservice. All associational common bonds will include a definition of the group anda geographic or ``operational area'' limitation_unless the constitutionor bylaws of the associational group limit the geographical area_e.g.,``Members of the ABC Association living or working in New York, New York,who qualify for membership in accordance with its constitution and bylawsin effect on January 21, 1989.'' The association itself may also be included in the field of membership_e.g.,``ABC Association.'' Some examples of associational group definitions are: a. ``Regular members of Locals 10 and 13, IBEW Union, Miami, Florida, whoqualify for membership in accordance with their constitution and bylawsin effect on May 20, 1989.'' b. ``Members of the Hoosier Farm Bureau who live or work in Grant, Logan,or Lee Counties of Indiana, who qualify for membership in accordance withits constitution and bylaws in effect on March 7, 1980.'' c. ``Members of the Mennonite Church who live or work in the State of Kansas.''d. ``Members of the Shalom Congregation who live in Chevy Chase, Maryland.''e. ``Regular members of the Corporate Executives Association, located inWestchester, New York, who live or work in Westchester, Rockland, and SuffolkCounties in New York, who qualify for membership in accordance with itsconstitution and bylaws in effect on December 1, 1985.'' f. ``Members of the Northern Michigan Electric Co-op located in Marquette,Michigan.'' Some examples of insufficiently defined associational group definitionsare: a. ``Members of military service clubs in the State of New Mexico.'' (Nosingle associational tie; specific clubs and locations must be named; maybe considered as multiple group). b. ``Veterans of U.S. military service.'' Some examples of unacceptable associational common bonds are: a. ``ABC Buyers Club.'' (An interest in purchasing only does not meet associationalstandards.) b. ``Customers of ABC Insurance Company.'' (Policyholders or customer/clientrelationships do not meet associational standards.) 3. <T3>Community Common Bonds. </T3>Congress has required that a credit unioncharter that will be based on a tie to a specific geographic location belimited to ``a well-defined neighborhood, community, or rural district.''NCUA policy is to limit the community to a single, compact, well-definedarea where residents commingle and interact regularly. NCRA recognizestwo types of affinity on which a community charter bond can be based: residenceand employment. Given the diversity of community characteristics throughoutthe country and NCUA's goal of making credit union service available tothose who wish to have it, NCUA has established the following common bondrequirements: a. The geographic area's boundaries must be clearly defined; and b. The charter applicant must establish that the area is recognized bythose who live and work there as a distinct ``neighborhood, community,or rural district.'' A typical definition of a community-based common bond is: ``Persons wholive or work in ABC, the area of XYZ City bounded by Fern Street on thenorth, Long Street on the east, Fourth Street on the south, and Elm Avenueon the west.'' If the community is also a recognized legal entity, it may also be includedin the field of membership_e.g., ``DEF Township.'' Some examples of community common bond definitions are: a. ``Persons who live or work in ABC County, Maine.'' b. ``Persons who live or work in Independent School District No. 1, ABCCounty, Minnesota.'' c. ``Persons who live or work within a ten-mile radius of Walnut, Illinois''(Rural areas only.) Some examples of insufficiently defined community common bond definitionsare: a. ``Persons who live or work within a ten-mile radius of Washington, D.C.''(Not a recognized ``neighborhood, community, or rural district.) b. ``Persons who live or work in the industrial section of XYZ, New York.''4. <T3>Multiple-Group Charters. </T3>NCUA may charter a Federal credit unionto serve a combination of distinct, definable occupational and/or associationalgroups. However, NCUA will not charter as a single Federal credit unionmultiple groups which include one based on a community common bond. In addition to general chartering requirements, special requirements pertainingto multiple-group applications must be satisfied before NCUA will grantsuch a charter. a. Each group to be included in the proposed field of membership of theFederal credit union must have its own common bond. b. Each group must individually request inclusion in the proposed Federalcredit union's charter. c. All groups must be within the operational area of a planned home orbranch office of the proposed Federal credit union. ``Operational area''is an area surrounding the home or a branch office that can be reasonablyserved by the applicant as determined by NCUA. For chartering purposes,``branch office'' means any office of a Federal credit union where an employeeaccepts payment on shares and disburses loans. An ATM or similar cash disbursingmachine does not qualify as a ``branch office.'' An example of a multiple-group field of membership is: ``The field of membership of this Federal credit union shall be limitedto those having the following common bond: 1. Employees of DuPont Corp. who work in Wilmington, Delaware; 2. Partners and employees of the law firm of Smith andamp; Jones who workin Wilmington, Delaware; 3. Members of the GHI Associations who live in Wilmington, Delaware, andqualify for membership in accordance with its constitution and bylaws.5. <T3>Other Persons Sharing Common Bond. </T3>A number of persons by virtueof their close relationship to a common bond group may be included at thecharter applicant's option in the field of membership: a. ``Spouses of persons who died while within the filed of membership ofthis credit union''; b. ``Employees of this credit union''; c. ``Persons retired as pensioners or annuitants from the above employment'';d. ``Members of their immediate families''; e. ``Volunteers''; f. ``Organizations of such persons.'' ``Members of their immediate families'' may be generally defined as deemedappropriate by a Federal credit union when including this group among thoseto be served. To be made effective, however, the Federal credit union'sboard of directors must approve the definition by resolution, and includeit in Article XVIII, Section 2, of its bylaws. The single exception isfor those Federal credit unions serving student groups: only the ``membersof the immediate families'' of students who actually join the Federal creditunion may be included. NCUA defines this secondary group for student groupsas follows: ``Members of the immediate families of students who are membersof this credit union.'' Volunteers, by virtue of their close relationship with a sponsor group,may be included. Examples include volunteers working at a hospital or ina church. Under Article II, Section 5, of NCUA's Standard Bylaws, if a member leavesthe field of membership, standard member services will be terminated. However,the board of directors may, by resolution, set forth the circumstancesunder which a member may maintain membership. This option is commonly referredto as the ``once a member, always a member'' bylaw provision. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Character and Fitness of Subscribers </ITAG>The Federal Credit Union Act requires that seven or more natural personsmust present to NCUA for approval a sworn organization certificate statingat a minimum: 1. The name of the proposed Federal credit union; 2. The location of the proposed Federal credit union and the territoryin which it will operate; 3. The names and addresses of the subscribers to the certificate and thenumber of shares subscribed by each; 4. The initial par value of the shares; 5. The proposed field of membership, specified in detail; 6. The term of the existence of the corporation, which may be perpetual;and 7. The fact that the certificate is made to enable such persons to availthemselves of the advantages of the Federal Credit Union Act. These seven or more persons will be the proposed Federal credit union's``subscribers.'' False statements on this certificate may be grounds forFederal criminal prosecution. The Act also requires NCUA to satisfy itself as to the ``general characterand fitness'' of these subscribers. These persons, therefore, may be thesubject of credit and background investigations at NCUA's discretion. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Economic Advisability </ITAG>Before chartering a Federal credit union, NCUA must be assured that theinstitution will be viable and that it will not materially affect existingstate or Federal credit unions. This economic advisability inquiry hasbecome especially important since 1970, when Congress assigned NCUA theobligation to establish a Fund insuring credit union shares and to preservethat Fund. NCUA will conduct an independent on-site investigation for each charterapplication to assure itself that the proposal can be successful. 1. <T3>The Proposed Federal Credit Union's Viability. </T3>The success ofany credit union depends on: (a) The depth of the members' support; (b)the character and fitness of management; and (c) present and projectedmarket conditions. a. <T3>Member Support. </T3>While NCUA has not set a minimum size field ofmembership for chartering a Federal credit union, experience has shownthat a credit union with under 500 potential members generally is unlikelyto succeed. A charter applicant with a proposed field of membership ofunder 500 will have to demonstrate convincing support for the credit union.For example, in an occupational group a commitment for significant long-termsupport from the employer must be in evidence. The group's size is only of help if members participate in the credit union.The charter applicant must show that a substantial percentage of the group'smembers will join the credit union and use its services. Survey resultsmust be based at a minimum on a sampling of 250 potential members. In particularinstances, especially where the common bond is broadly-defined or newly-established,NCUA may require a larger sampling. b. <T3>Proposed Management's Character and Fitness. </T3>The applicant mustprovide a list of the persons who will serve as officials. NCUA will conducta credit and background (including criminal record) investigation on eachof the proposed Federal credit union's officials. NCUA also reserves theright to perform such checks on employees of the applicant FCU. The Agencywill also need assurance that the management team will have the requisiteskills_particularly in leadership and accounting_and the commitment todedicate in the time and effort needed to make the Federal credit uniona success. c. <T3>Present and Future Market Conditions. </T3>The ability to compete inthe marketplace and to adapt to changing market conditions is key to thesurvival of any enterprise, and a crucial part of that is the ability toplan well. NCUA, therefore, requires an applicant to submit a businessplan based on realistic and supportable proejctions and assumptions, including,as a minimum, these elements: i. Mission statement; ii. Analysis of market conditions_economic prospects for the group, availabilityof financial services from credit unions, banks, Sandamp;Ls; iii. Summary of survey results; iv. Financial services needed/desired; v. Financial services to be provided; vi. How/when services are to be implemented; vii. Staffing of credit union and credentials of key employees; viii. Physical facility_office, equipment; ix. Type of recordkeeping system; x. Budget for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year; xi. Semiannual pro forma financial statements for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year,including assumptions_e.g., loans and dividend rates; xii. Goals for number of members; xiii. Goals for operating independently; xiv. Source of funds to pay expenses during initial months of operation;xv. Written policies (lending, investments, funds management);xvi. Goals for dividends, generation of resources; xvii. Plan for continuity_directors, committee members; and xviii. Evidence of sponsor commitment if subsidies are critical to successof the Federal credit union. NCUA expects that the subscribers and proposed officials will understandand support the business plan submitted. <T3>2. Overlaps. </T3>(This discussion pertains to new charters as wellas existing charters.) An overlap exists when a group of persons is eligible for membership intwo or more credit unions, including state charters. General policy requiresthat every effort be made to avoid an overlap. Ideally, a group of personsshould be included in the field of membership in only one credit union.Both new and existing credit unions are obligated to investigate the possibilityof an overlap prior to submitting an application for a new charter or addinga group, by surveying the prospective field of membership and contactingthe state credit union supervisor and the local credit union league ortrade association. If and when an overlap situation does arise, officialsof the involved credit unions are encouraged to work out the overlap probleminternally. If the matter is resolved informally, the applicant must submita letter to that effect from the credit union whose field of membershipalready includes the subject group. If no resolution is possible, an applicationfor a new charter or expansion may still be submitted, but must also includeinformation regarding the overlap and document attempts at informal resolution.In any event, the applicant Federal credit union must clearly indicatewhy a new credit union or expansion is being sought and why existing andpotential members of the current credit union will support and join a newly-charteredor expanded Federal credit union. When resolution of an overlap problem is not forthcoming, and other circumstanceswarrant an overlap, then an overlap may be permitted. Among the circumstanceswhich may justify an overlap are (1) failure of the original credit unionto provide service to the group, (2) limited participation by members oremployees of the group in the original credit union after the expirationof a reasonable period of time, and (3) incidental overlap (the group ofpersons in question is so small as to have no material effect on the originalcredit union). In reviewing the overlap, the Regional Directors will considerthe nature of the problem; efforts made to resolve the problem; financialeffect on the overlapped credit union; the desires of the group(s); theopinion of the state credit union supervisor, if applicable, and otherinterested parties; and the best interests of the involved potential orcurrent members. In general, NCUA will not protect associational and communitycharters from overlaps with occupational charters. A number of situations may not justify approval of a requested overlap.For example, if the requesting credit union offers certain specializedservices not offered by the orignal credit union (such as credit cards,ATMs, and IRAs), the extra services alone may not justify the overlap.Also, proximity, by itself, does not warrant approval of an overlap. AFederal credit union in Chicago, Illinois, may not have a convincing argument,based on geography alone, that a select employee group (SEG) also locatedin Chicago would be better served by it than by the SEG's headquarterscredit union located in Dallas, Texas. From an overlap prevention perspective, new charter applicants and everyoccupational or associational group which comes before the Regional Directorsfor affiliation with an existing Federal credit union must advise in writingwhether the group is included within the field of membership of any othercredit union. This requirement will alert the Regional Directors to possibleoverlap situations before they occur. Thus, most potential field of membershipconflicts can be avoided. If cases do arise where the assurance given toa Regional Director concerning unavailability of credit union service turnsout later to be inaccurate, the misinformation is grounds for removal ofthe group from the Federal credit union's charter. 3. <T3>Exclusionary Clauses. </T3>(This discussion pertains to new chartersas well as existing charters.) In certain instances, exclusionary wording prohibiting certain overlapsmay be used to help define the field of membership of a Federal creditunion. Use of exclusionary wording should be avoided if possible. Generally,a thorough investigation of a charter application or an application fora field of membership expansion will disclose the situations where othercredit union service is available. The field of membership should be writtenso that only the specific locations where credit union service is not currentlyavailable are allotted to the new charter or to the FCU seeking the fieldof membership addition. However, certain cases exist where a specific recitation of work locations(for an occupational group) or member locations (for an associational group)is not feasible. Corporations or associations with widely-dispersed employeesor members fall into this ``exception'' category. In these special cases,exclusionary wording could be used to provide some limits on an extensivefield of membership. An example might be employees of XYZ Corporation whereXYZ Corporation is a relatively new company which specializes in acquisitionsand divestitures and its corporate makeup is constantly changing. In thiscase the field of membership could be described as ``employees of XYZ Corporationwho work in the United States, except employees eligible for membershipin another occupational-type credit union serving an employee unit of XYZCorporation.'' Another situation which may require exclusionary wording is the charteringof a new community credit union or the field of membership conversion ofan existing occupational or associational credit union to a community charter.Although investigation may show that the residents of the proposed areaof service by and large do not have access to a credit union, other creditunions may be operating in the community which desire to remain autonomousentities. If the Regional Director determines that avoidance of overlapis warranted, an exclusionary clause may be inserted in the community creditunion's field of membership. Examples of exclusionary wording are as follows:1. Persons who reside or work in Portland, Maine except persons eligiblefor primary membership in ABC Employees Federal Credit Union or PortlandCity Employees Credit Union as of the date of this charter; 2. Persons who reside or work in Hilo, Hawaii, except employees of HiloSugar Company and the United States Government; The exclusionary language in a community charter's field of membershipordinarily applies only to ``primary'' members of existing occupational-typecredit unions. `Primary'' is defined as the basic occupational or associationalaffinity to the field of membership defined in section 5 of the charter.In example 1 above, assuming that the two excluded Federal credit unionshave single sponsor fields of membership, only employees of ABC Companyand of the City of Portland would be excluded. Family members (or othersecondary or derivative members) are not excluded. Also, unless specialcircumstances warrant, only occupational field of membership will be protectedby the exclusion. That is, associational, multiple group and other communitycredit unions will not normally be afforded protection from overlap. Finally,by dating the exclusion, only those employee units in the field(s) of membershipof the protected credit union(s) as of the specified date are excludedfrom membership eligibility in the community credit union. Thus, groupsadded by an occupational credit union subsequent to the establishment ofthe community charter are not excluded from the community credit union.In the second example above, dating the exclusion clause, which is writtenvery specifically, is inappropriate. Although use of exclusionary clauses by NCUA will normally be on an exceptionbasis only, Regional Directors may, at their discretion, apply exclusionarywording to a credit union's field of membership. However, the clauses shallnot be used in lieu of a thorough investigation of the availability ofexisting credit union service by a charter applicant or an applicant fora field of membership addition. Furthermore, it is NCUA's intent to useexclusionary clauses only to increase the vitality and strength of thecredit union system, not to prevent people from obtaining credit unionservice. III. Appropriateness of Proposed Federal Credit Union Name It is the responsibility of the Federal credit union organizers to ensurethat the FCU applicant's name or FCU name change does not constitute aninfringement on the name of any corporation in their trade area. Priorto granting a charter or approving a name change, NCUA will ensure thatthe credit union's name: (a) Is not already being used by another Federalcredit union; (b) will not be confused with NCUA or another Federal orState agency, or with another credit union; and (c) does not include inappropriatelanguage. The last three words in the name of every credit union charteredby NCUA must be ``Federal Credit Union.'' IV. Widely-Dispersed Associational Charters NCUA policy is to charter associational Federal credit unions at the lowestlevel which is economically feasible. This does not preclude the grantingof associational charters with widely-dispersed memberships. NCUA may grantsuch charters after scrutinizing the adequecy of the applicant's commonbond. NCUA may, at its discretion, require that the proposed field of membershipbe narrowed before granting a new charter; expansion to include a largerportion of the association's members may be allowed at a later time ifappropriate. Also, as with any widely-dispersed group, overlap issues are likely toarise, either at the time of or subsequent to chartering. NCUA may haveto consider the effect that granting a charter with such a group in itsfield of membership would have on any number of existing credit unions.In addition, an associational credit union with a widely-dispersed membershipmay expect overlaps to be granted to other credit unions in the future,particularly at the local level. In recognition of these unique problems, NCUA follows a separate internalprocedure for associational charter applications for associations withproposed fields of membership of 500 or more persons which cross NCUA regionalboundaries. NCUA's Director of Examination and Insurance and all NCUA RegionalDirectors with any of the association's members located in their regionmust vote on the charter application. A majority vote is required for approvals;tie votes are referred directly to the NCUA Board for decision; denialsare appealable to the Board. V. Industrial Parks, Shopping Centers and Similar GroupingsA Federal charter may be available to persons working in a particular industrialpark or shopping mall, either as community-based or as a multiple group.If the multiple group option is selected, all multiple group requirementsmust be met. Each employee group within the industrial park or shoppingcenter must submit a letter requesting service. Only those groups submittingletters will be added to the charter. If the community option is selected,the industrial park or shopping center must meet the standards for communitycharters.VI. Specially-Designated Federal Credit UnionsSome credit unions are recognized and designated by NCUA to perform certainfunctions different from those available to Federal credit unions in general.An applicant wishing to be considered for such a designation may, at thetime of charter application, provide the additional information NCUA needs.NCUA will then consider the designation and the charter application together.The designation can also be applied for at a later time if all the requirementsare met.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Low-Income Credit Union</ITAG>A low-income credit union is defined as one where a majority of its membersfall into one or more of these categories: (1) Those whose annual incomefalls at or below the lower-level standard of living classification asestablished by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and as updated by the Employmentand Training Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor; (2) thosewho are residents of a public housing project who quality for such residencybecause of low income; (3) those who qualify as recipients in a communityaction program; (4) those who are enrolled as full-time or part-time studentsin a college, university, high school, or vocational school. The Federalcredit union applicant should forward a separate request for a low-incomedesignation at the time the application is submitted with appropriate documentation.A credit union designated by NCUA as a low-income credit union has greaterflexibility in accepting nonmember deposits insured by NCUA. The creditunion may also participate in special funding such as the Community DevelopmentRevolving Loan Program for Credit Unions if it is involved in the stimulationof economic development activities and community revitalization efforts.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Corporate Federal Credit Union</ITAG>A corporate credit union is defined as: (1) One that is operated primarilyfor the purpose of serving other credit unions; and (2) one whose totaldollar amount of outstanding loans to member credit unions plus sharesissued to member credit unions equals or exceeds 75 percent of its totaloutstanding loans plus shares and deposits. They are governed by differentreserving and other standards as set forth in Part 704 of NCUA's Rulesand Regulations.VII. How to Apply for a Federal Credit Union Charter<ITAG tagnum="81">A Organizing a Federal Credit Union</ITAG>Federal credit unions are organized by persons who donate time and resourcesand are responsible for determining the interest, commitment, and advisabilityof forming a Federal credit union. The organization of a Federal creditunion takes considerable planning and dedication in order to ensure thesuccess of the new credit union.Persons interested in organizing a Federal credit union should contactthe NCUA Regional Director serving the state in which the credit unionwill be organized or their state credit union league. A list of NCUA officesis attached as Exhibit A to this Chapter. NCUA will provide informationto groups interested in pursuing a Federal charter and will assist themin obtaining an organizer.A credit union organizer may be a trade association representative, anNCUA examiner, or a volunteer with training and experience in charteringnew Federal credit unions. The functions of the organizer are to providedirection, guidance, and advice on the chartering process. The organizeralso provides the group with information about a credit union's functionsand purpose as well as technical assistance in preparing and submittingthe charter application. Close communication and cooperation between theorganizer and the group members is critical to the chartering process.Once the group has decided to apply for a Federal credit union charterand the organizer is satisfied that the application has merit, the groupshould elect 7 to 10 persons to serve as subscribers. The subscribers andorganizer will work together to ensure that information required in theFederal Credit Union Investigation Report (NCUA 4001 for Federal creditunion applicants or NCUA 4000 for applications to convert to a Federalcharter) is well supported and documented. The organizer and subscribersshould develop a business plan as discussed earlier in this chapter. Thesubscribers should also locate willing individuals capable of serving onthe board of directors, credit committee, supervisory committee, and astreasurer/manager of the proposed credit union. This documentation willbe submitted along with other chartering documents by the organizer followingthe charter organization meeting.A charter organization meeting will be called as soon as the subscribersand organizer are satisfied that the required chartering information hasbeen collected. The charter organization meeting should be attended byall subscribers, persons who have agreed to serve on the board or comittees,and any other potential members of the credit union. At this meeting, theorganizer will discuss the progress and conclusions of the charter investigation,will announce the proposed slate of officials, and will respond to anyquestions posed at the meeting. When satisfied that the group meets allthe chartering requirements, the subscribers should then sign and havenotorized two copies of the Organization Certificate (NCUA 4008) and providethis to the organizer for inclusion in the charter application. As theirfinal duty, the subscribers will elect the board of directors and creditcommittee of the proposed Federal credit union. The charter organizationmeeting should then be adjourned.Following the charter organization meeting, the board of directors shouldmeet to elect officers and appoint members of the supervisory committee.The credit and supervisory committees should then meet to elect their respectivechairmen and secretaries. The minutes of these and all future board ofdirectors and committee meetings should be kept and safeguarded by theirrespective secretaries. Each official should execute a copy of Report ofOfficials and Agreement to Serve (NCUA 4012) to be submitted with the charterapplication package.The board of directors should take action to apply for insurance of memberaccounts. The Certificate of Resolutions (NCUA 9501) should be executedby the president and secretary. Following action on this issue, the presidentand treasurer should execute the Application and Agreements for Insuranceof Accounts (NCUA 9500). These documents should be provided to the organizeras part of the charter application. These actions conclude the major activitiesfor the first meeting of the board of directors.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Support for Charter Application</ITAG>As discussed previously in this Chapter, applicants for Federal creditunion charters must, at a minimum, provide evidence that:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The group constitutes a recognized common bond;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The subscribers are of good character; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The establishment of the credit union is economically feasible.</ITAG>In addition, the Federal Credit Union Act requires applicants to submita sworn organization certificate setting forth seven criteria (see sectionII B of this Chapter). In order to process the application and captureall required information, NCUA has developed certain chartering forms toassist organizers.1. <T3>Federal Credit Union Investigation Report. </T3>Applications for newFederal credit unions will be submitted on Form NCUA 4001. (State-charteredcredit unions applying for conversion to Federal charter will use FormNCUA 4000. See Chapter 4 for a full discussion.) The organizer is requiredto certify the information and recommend approval or disapproval, basedon the investigation of the request. Instructions and guidance for completingthe form are provided on the form's reverse side. Associational charterapplicants must include a statement of their membership criteria (normallythe group's constitution or bylaws) and a current financial statement.2. <T3>Report of Official and Agreement to Serve, NCUA 4012. </T3>This formdocuments general background information of each official of the proposedFederal credit union. Each official must complete and sign this form. Inaddition, NCUA will request credit and criminal investigations of new officials.3. <T3>Organization Certificate, NCUA 4008. </T3>This document establishesthe seven criteria required of subscribers by the Federal Credit UnionAct and is signed by the subscribers and notarized. This document shouldbe executed in duplicate.4. <T3>Certification of Resolutions, NCUA 9501. </T3>This document certifiesthat the board of directors of the proposed Federal credit union has resolvedto apply for insurance of member accounts and has authorized the presidentand treasurer to execute the Application and Agreements for Insurance ofAccounts. This form must be signed by both the president and secretaryof the proposed Federal credit union.5. <T3>Application and Agreements for Insurance of Accounts, NCUA 9500. </T3>Thisdocument contains the agreements with which Federal credit unions mustcomply in order to obtain National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF)coverage of member accounts, including appropriate fidelity bond coverageof officials. The document must be completed and signed by both the presidentand treasurer.6. <T3>Business Plan. </T3>While the required business plan need not followa prescribed form, it must include all of the information set forth inChapter 1.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Submittal of Application</ITAG>Applications for new charters should be submitted to the Regional Directorserving the state in which the proposed credit union is headquartered.Applications for Federal credit union charters should include, at a minimum,the documentation discussed in section B above. All charter applicationsare processed by the Regional Director in accordance with NCUA procedures.The appropriate NCUA regional office will investigate all applicationsfor Federal credit union charters. The investigation will include on-sitecontacts by NCUA with proposed officials and others having an interestin the proposed new charter. Credit and background checks will be requestedfor the credit unions' proposed officials. NCUA will acknowledge receiptof the application and will estimate processing time. Every effort willbe made to act expeditiously on all applications.VIII. Letters of Understanding and AgreementNCUA has found from experience that certain activities generally causesignificant problems for new credit unions. Therefore, in most cases, NCUAwill require the prospective Federal credit union's officials to enterinto an agreement not to engage in certain activities. The agreement isfor a limited term_usually two to four years. A sample letter is attachedas Exhibit B of this Chapter.IX. ApprovalsNCUA will make every effort to process the application expeditiously. Onceapproved, the board of directors of the newly-formed Federal credit unionwill receive a signed charter and by-laws from the Regional Director. Inaddition, the officials will be advised of the name and mailing addressof the examiner who has been assigned responsibility for supervising andexamining the credit union. Generally, the examiner will contact the creditunion officials shortly after approval of the charter in order to arrangefor the initial examination (usually within the first six months of operation).Assistance in commencing operations is generally available through thevarious state credit union leagues.X. AppealsNew charter applications denied by the NCUA Regional Office are appealableto the NCUA Board. All such appeals should be sent to the appropriate NCUARegional Office.<ITAG tagnum="74">Exhibit A_NCUA Regions/Regional Offices</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Region I_Albany</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">9 Washington Square, Washington Avenue Extension, Albany, NY 12205</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Commercial: 518-472-4554</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">FTS: 8-562-4454</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">FAX: 518-869-1788</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Maine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Rhode Island</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">New Hampshire</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Connecticut</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Vermont</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">New York</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Massachusetts</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">New Jersey</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Virgin Islands</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Puerto Rico</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Region II_Capital</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">1776 G Street, NW, Suite 800, Washington, DC 20006</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Commercial: 202-682-1900</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">FAX: 202-789-2043</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Pennsylvania</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Delaware</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Maryland</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Virginia</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">West Virginia</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">District of Columbia</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Region III_Atlanta</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">7000 Central Parkway, Suite 1600, Atlanta, Georgia 30328</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Commercial: 404-396-4042</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">FAX: 404-698-8211</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Kentucky</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Louisiana</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Tennessee</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Arkansas</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">North Carolina</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Georgia</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">South Carolina</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Alabama</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Mississippi</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Florida</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Region IV_Chicago</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">300 Park Blvd., Suite 155, Itasca, Illinois 60143</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Commercial: 312-250-6000</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">FTS: 8-312-250-6000</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">FAX: 312-889-9707</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Wisconsin</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Indiana</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Michigan</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Illinois</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Ohio</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Missouri</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Region V_Austin</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">48007 Spicewood Springs Road, Suite 5200, Austin, Texas 78759</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Commercial: 512-482-4500</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">FTS: 8-770-4500</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">FAX: 512-482-4511</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Kansas</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">New Mexico</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Oklahoma</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Utah</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Arizona</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Texas</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Austin Suboffice</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">320 6th Street, Room 202, Sioux City, Iowa 51101</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Commercial: 712-233-3233</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">FTS: 8-862-3233</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">FAX: 712-255-9145</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Minnesota</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">South Dakota</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Iowa</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">North Dakota</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Nebraska</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Wyoming</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Colorado</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24"> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Region VI_Pacific</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">2300 Clayton Road, Suite 1350, Concord, California 94520</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Commercial: 415-486-3490</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">FTS: 8-449-3490</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">FAX: 415-486-3729</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Washington</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Montana</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Oregon</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Idaho</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">California</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Nevada</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Alaska</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Guam</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">Hawaii</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24"> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">EXHIBIT B_LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING AND AGREEMENT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To the Board of Directors and Other Officials <T2>XXXXXXXXXX</T2> Federal Credit Union</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Since the purposes of credit unions are to promote thrift and makefunds available for loans to credit union members for provident and productivepurposes, and since newly-chartered credit unions do not generally havesufficient reserve to cover large losses on loans or meet unduly largeliquidity requirements, Federal insurance coverage of member accounts underthe National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund will be granted to the abovenamed credit union subject to the conditions listed in this Letter of Understandingand Agreement and in the Organization Certificate and Application and Agreementsfor Insurance of Accounts.

To uphold the provisions of the Federal Credit Union Act concerningthe granting of Federal charters; B. To promote credit union safety and soundness; and C. To make quality credit union service available to all those who wishto have it. A Federal credit union's field of membership is an official statement whichspecifically defines who may become a member of the credit union. It isrecorded in section 5 of the credit union's charter. Any change to the field of membership, whether it is an addition, deletion,or simple update, must be reflected formally in section 5 of the creditunion's charter. Changes to section 5 are normally initiated by the officialsof the respective Federal credit union and submitted in writing to theappropriate NCUA Regional Office for approval. The National Credit Union Administration Board has delegated the authorityto the Regional Directors to act on most charter amendment requests. Thisdelegation enables the Agency to respond to the majority of requests promptly.However, certain complex proposals require special investigation by theRegional Directors, and may also require consultation with other RegionalDirectors and the Agency's Central Office. Applicants submitting such complexproposals will be advised in writing of the need for special review andthe likelihood of extra processing time. Reasons for Requesting an Amendment A Federal credit union's board of directors may wish to request a fieldof membership amendment for a variety of reasons, including, but not limitedto:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Providing credit union access and service to an additional, clearly-definedgroup of persons who desire to be served by the applicant credit union;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Accommodating sponsor acquisitions or reoganization; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Diversifying the membership base in order to withstand real or potentialeconomic adversities (e.g., sponsor shutdown or cutback, economic downturn);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Merger with another credit union; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Expanding the membership base to facilitate an improvement of serviceto all members. </ITAG>Field of Membership Addition Requests_Types and CriteriaAs noted in the previous chapter, four types of common bond (occupation,association, community, and multiple group) are recognized for purposesof chartering a Federal credit union. Field of membership expansions areachieved by adding groups (either occupational, associational or community)to an existing credit union. The definition of common bond for purposes of field of membership additionsis the same as that found in the previous chapter concerning Federal creditunion chartering. The examples of groups which do and do not meet the definitionof common bond found in that chapter apply to field of membership additionsas well. Different criteria apply to occupational, associations and multiplegroup field of membership additions than apply to community field of membershipexpansions. These two sets of criteria are discussed below. Special rules apply for credit union additions to provide service to retireeand senior citizen groups. Additional methods of increasing the field ofmembership additions are possible through a merger or a purchase andamp;assumption. All of these types of expansion are discussed briefly below.Occupational and associational groups which share the same common bondas the credit union's primary sponsor fall under the category of commonbond additions. Occupational and associational groups which have a separatecommon bond from a Federal credit union's primary sponsor (common bondgroup) are added under the provisions of select group field of membershipexpansion policy. Select group and common bond expansions are treated somewhatdifferently. Additions Within the Common Bond Some field of membership expansions for occupational and associationaltype Federal credit unions can be accomplished along traditional commonbond lines. For example, an FCU whose primary sponsor is a particular corporationmay add by a charter amendment the employees of that corporation who workat another location, employees of the corporation who are paid from orare supervised from the headquarters location, such as sales persons orsales agents who work at a number of locations, employees of a divisionor a majority-owned subsidiary of the parent corporation regardless oflocation, or employees of a related company (such as a company under contractand possessing a strong dependency relationship on the sponsoring corporation).The written request for an addition must be supported by a letter froman authoritative representative of the corporate unit to be added. Thisletter should indicate:(1) That the group wants to affiliate with the applicant Federal creditunion;(2) That at present the group does not have the availability of a creditunion; and(3) The number of persons currently employed by the corporate unit.Whenever possible, this letter should be submitted on the letterhead stationeryof the respective corporate entity. Included with the request for expansionmust be a current financial statement for the applicant Federal creditunion.For associational Federal credit unions, expansions along common bond lineswill normally be allowed only at the lowest economically feasible organizationallevel of the sponsoring association. For example, a Federal credit unionserving the members of a local chapter of an association could apply toserve the members of another chapter.The approval or disapproval of a field of membership amendment requestof an existing FCU adding an association which crosses NCUA regional boundariesmay be subject to special review, and this may cause some delay in processing.The Regional Director whose jurisdiction includes the applicant creditunion will notify the applicant of the special review and will advise theapplicant in writing of the estimated time frame needed to reach a decision.Unlike select group additions, common bond additions do not have operationalarea requirements. That is, an addition within the common bond may be approvedeven though the applicant FCU does not have an office in the vicinity ofthe group to be added.Select Group AdditionsA select group of persons seeking credit union service from an occupational,associational or multiple group Federal credit union must have its owncommon bond. The select groups themselves may be either employee (occupational)groups or associational groups. However, a select group for expansion purposescannot be defined by a common bond of community. The group's common bondneed not be similar to the common bond(s) of the existing Federal creditunion. In addition to the group having its own common bond, the followingfive criteria must be satisfied before an addition request will be approved.a. All affected groups have requested service from the applicant FCU.b. The applicant FCU possesses the financial resources and management capabilityto provide quality credit union service to each group. The applicant creditunion's current CAMEL rating and financial condition will be consideredunder this criterion.c. The addition request is economically feasible and advisable.d. The applicant obtains a written statement from each group indicatingwhether the group is currently eligible for membership or is being servedby any other credit union. If the groups are eligible for membership inanother credit union, justification must be provided to show that the groupsno longer desire that eligibility for continued service. The applicantcredit union must provide a written statement from any overlapped creditunion concurring or objecting to the overlap.e. The group must be within the operational area of the home or a branchoffice of the FCU. Operational area is defined as an area surrounding thehome or branch office that can reasonably be served by the applicant asdetermined by NCUA. Although a new select group alone is not enough tojustify a proposed branch office, it is permissible to include new groupsas partial justification for a proposed branch office if that office willalso improve credit union service to the existing field of membership.However, the current field of membership must comprise a significant portionof the total field of membership to be served initially by the proposedbranch office. A branch office means any office of a Federal credit unionwhere an employee accepts payment on shares and disburses loans., An ATM,or similar cash disbursing machine, does not qualify as a branch officefor purposes of field of membership expansion.The process to add a select group to a Federal credit union's field ofmembership is a relatively simple one. A Federal credit union must submita formal written request for the expansion to the appropriate RegionalOffice of NCUA. The request should be signed by the credit union's presidentor chairman of the board of directors. Accompanying the correspondencefrom the requesting credit union should be (1) a letter signed by an authoritativerepresentative of each select group to be added and (2) a current financialstatement for the requesting credit union. The letter from the select groupshould indicate at least the following:1. The number of employees or members in the select group;2. Whether the group currently has access to another credit union (if itdoes, then the other credit union should be specifically identified. Aletter from the overlapped credit union should be obtained stating itsconcurrence or objection. If objections are raised, then the overlappedcredit union is required to furnish the number of persons from the selectgroup who are enrolled as members.);3. That the select group is interested in obtaining service from the requestingcredit union and that the group will support the credit union by such meansas providing access to its employees or members via payroll deduction,use of employee or member newsletters, etc., and4. The proximity to the applicant credit union's closest office.Credit unions using the select group addition alternative should obtainthe supporting letter from the group on the select group's letterhead stationery.The letterhead will enable NCUA to correctly identify the proper titleof the select group and will provide validation of the select group's location(to ensure that the operational area requirement is satisfied).It is possible for a Federal credit union to serve the employees or membersof a select group who are located outside the operating area of the creditunion as long as the select group has its headquarters (or its ``paid from'')location within the credit union's operating area, or a majority of thecompany's employees work within the credit union's operational area. However,special care will be exercised by the Regional Directors in consideringrequests for select associational group expansions where the association'smembership is geographically dispersed. The associational chartering policycriteria discussed in Chapter 1 will apply in its entirety to select associationalgroup expansion requests.Community FCU Field of Membership ExpansionsCommunity Federal credit union's may expand their fields of membershiponly by redefining the boundaries of their service area. Community charterpolicy stipulates that there be regular contact among persons who liveor work within a well-defined neighborhood, community or rural districtin order to satisfy the common bond requirements of the Federal CreditUnion Act. The burden of proof for existence of the common bond is placedupon the applicant credit union.An existing community Federal credit union may submit a request to expandits area of service by changing the boundaries which define its communityfield of membership. The enlarged area must constitute a geographical areathat could be established as a community credit union under NCUA policy.Also, an existing occupational, associational or multiple group type Federalcredit union may apply to convert to a community charter. In order to supporta case for such an expansion, the applicant Federal Credit Union must submita map or maps showing both the existing and proposed boundaries for thefield of membership. The most current population figures for the two areasmust be obtained and included in the package. The source of the populationinformation must be recorded in the credit union's request. Evidence inthe form of surveys or letters from authoritative representatives of prominentgroups located in the area to be added must be furnished to show that theresidents of the area are interested in affiliating with the applicantcredit union. Information concerning the availability of financial servicesto the residents of the new area must be supplied. Especially importantis whether other credit union service is currently available. If presentcredit union service to the residents of the new area is adequate, theremay be no basis for the proposed expansion.In addition, depending upon the significance of the potential membershipincrease, the Regional Director may require formulation of a business planto show how the residents of the new area are to be served and whetherthe costs of this proposed service can be afforded by the applicant creditunion. Whether or not a formal business plan is required, the applicantFCU must submit current financial statements with its proposal.Finally, in the majority of cases where community credit unions are askingto expand their areas of service and in all cases where a conversion toa community charter is proposed, an NCUA examiner will make an on-siteevaluation of the proposal. The examiner will prepare a separate analysisof the proposed expansion independent of the credit union's application.Following completion of the on-site evaluation and Regional Office reviewof the examiner's report, the Regional Director will act on the proposal,provided that the size of the proposed area's population does not exceedhis delegated authority. If so, the applicant credit union will be formallyapprised of the need for NCUA Board consideration.Addition of Retiree or Senior Citizen AssociationsSpecial rules apply for retiree or senior citizen groups that seek creditunion service. For field of membership addition purposes, these groupsare viewed as unique associational groups which do not need to meet allthe requirements for associations discussed in Chapter 1. It is NCUA Boardpolicy to make FCU service available to as many senior citizens and retireesas possible who are in fact interested in obtaining access to a creditunion. Federal credit unions are encouraged to bring associations of seniorcitizens or retired persons within their fields of membership, and to sponsorand assist in the formation of such associations where they do not exist.The policies recited in Chapter 1 for associational groups (requiring thatthe sponsoring association be well-established and that it not be an organizationcreated solely as a vehicle to obtain credit union service) do not applyto retiree or senior citizen associations. Such groups may be formed withthe primary purpose of providing eligibility for FCU service to the associationsand their members. The definitions of senior citizen or retiree are leftto each organization. The operational area criterion does apply to seniorcitizen and retiree organizations.Additions Via Mergers and Purchase and AssumptionsA Federal credit union may obtain the entire field of membership of anothercredit union through a merger. In general, for mergers where the continuingcredit union is federally chartered, the field of membership criteria stipulatedin this and the preceding chapter are applicable. The criteria do not applyin the case of emergency mergers.The following discussion pertains to a continuing credit union that isfederally chartered. Most mergers fall into one of two fields of membershipcategories. The mergers are feasible either because the two credit unionshad common sponsors (like common bonds) or were located in the same operationalarea (multiple group). Two credit unions serving the employees of the samecorporation may merge without regard to the locations of the credit unions'offices. Similarly, two credit unions serving members of the same associationmay merge even though the two are not located in the same operational area.However, two credit unions with unlike fields of membership may only mergewhen they are located in the same operational area. Any combination ofassociational, multiple group, and occupational is permissible as longas the operational area requirement is satisfied. Mergers of any of thesethree types of field of membership into a community charter are permissibleas long as the merging credit union is located within the community creditunion's service area. The resulting field of membership remains a communitycharter.Mergers of community credit unions into a Federal credit union of any typemay be accomplished where the operational area requirement is satisfiedand the continuing Federal credit union is not interested in obtainingthe field of membership of the merging community charter. The continuingFederal credit union will only obtain the members of record of the mergingcredit union. Where both credit unions are community charters and the criteriafor expanding the service area of a community credit union (as discussedpreviously in this chapter) are satisfied, the entire field of membershipof the merging credit union will be added to the continuing Federal creditunion's charter. Where the merging community credit union is sufferingsuch severe financial difficulties that it will become insolvent withinsix months, it may merge into any Federal credit union in the same operationalarea, and the field of membership of the community credit union will betransferred intact to the continuing Federal credit union. In this case,the continuing Federal credit union will remain as an occupational, associationalor multiple group charter for purposes of future field of membership expansions.Finally, a specifically designated emergency merger may be approved bythe NCUA Board without regard to field of membership or other legal constraints.An emergency merger involves NCUA's direct intervention. The credit unionto be merged must either be insolvent or in danger of insolvency and theNCUA Board must determine that:A. An emergency requiring expeditious action exists;B. Other alternatives are not reasonably available; and C. The public interest would best be served by approving the merger.In an emergency merger situation, NCUA takes an active role in findinga suitable merger partner (continuing credit union). NCUA is primarilyconcerned that the continuing credit union has the financial strength andmanagement expertise to absorb the troubled credit union without adverselyaffecting its own financial condition and stability. As a stipulated conditiontto an emergency merger, the field of membership of the merging credit unionmay be transferred intact to the continuing credit union.Another alternative for acquiring the field of membership of a failingcredit union is through consolidation known as purchase and assumption.A purchase and assumption has limited application because the failing creditunion must be placed into involuntary liquidation. However, in the fewinstances where purchase and assumption may occur, the assuming Federalcredit union may acquire the entire field of membership along with loans,shares and certain designated assets and liabilities, without regard tofield of membership expansion restrictions and without changing the characterof the credit union for purposes of future field of membership expansions.Spin-offsA ``spin-off'' is, in effect, a partial merger. By agreement of the parties,a portion of the field of membership of a credit union, along with assets,liabilities, and capital, is transferred to a new or existing credit union.If the spin-off goes to a new Federal charter, the requirements of Chapter1 apply. If it goes to an existing Federal charter, the requirements ofChapter 2 apply. Prior to completion, NCUA must approve all spin-offs inwhich a Federal credit union is involved.OverlapsSee Chapter 1 of discussion.Exclusionary ClausesSee Chapter 1 for discussion.Reviewing Field of Membership Addition RequestsAll fields of membership requests will be reviewed by Regional Office staffin order to ensure that the requests conform to NCUA policy, are properlydocumented and do not cause significantly harmful or unreasonable overlapwith the fields of membership of existing credit unions. NCUA understandsand appreciates the importance of timely processing of well-supported additionrequests. To respond to this desire for prompt handling, each RegionalOffice has established a goal of ten working days from the date of receiptin the Regional Office for complete processing of a routine addition request.A fully documented request that fulfills all of the criteria discussedin this manual and does not require written or telephone follow-up willnormally be processed within this time.In some cases, an on-site review by NCUA examiner staff may be requestedby the Regional Director before acting on a proposed addition. Nonstandardor controversial requests, those involving associational, community ormultiple charters, or those from credit unions with serious operationalor management poroblems, are most likely to fall into this category. Inaddition, as stated in the earlier discussion in this chapter under communitycharter expansions, the Regional Director may, at his discretion, aftertaking into account the significance of the field of membership expansionproposed, require the applicant to submit a business plan.The condition of the requesting credit union will be considered in everyinstance. The economic feasibility of expanding the field of membershipof a credit union with serious management or operational problems mustbe carefully considered by regional staff if the safety and soundness ofthe credit union is to be preserved. In most cases, field of membershipadditions will only be approved for credit unions which are operating satisfactorily.If a Federal credit union is having difficulty providing good service toits current membership, it may have even more difficulty serving an enlargedfield of membership. In some cases, expanding the field of membership ofa struggling credit union may do more harm than good. A struggling creditunion's resources need to be focused on current problems. Placing an additionalstrain on these resources by increasing the field of membership may alsoincrease the credit union's problems.If the requested addition is approved by the Regional Director, the creditunion will be furnished a formal, updated section 5 of its charter whichrestates the field of membership, including the requested addition. Afteraction by the board of directors, the form should be promptly filed withthe credit union's official charter and bylaws.If the request is denied by the Regional Director, the credit union willbe so advised in writing and furnished specific reasons for the denial.This correspondence may include suggestions and other options for the creditunion's consideration. This letter will also include information aboutthe availability of the appeals process. If a credit union's request isdisapproved by the Regional Director, the credit union may appeal the decision(or request a review of the policy involved) to the NCUA Board throughthe appropriate Regional Director.Service Status ReportsFederal credit unions which frequently add select groups to their fieldsof membership should be prepared to furnish a written summary of the resultsof their efforts to bring service to the employees or members of the selectgroups. The Regional Offices will request periodically that such FCU'ssubmit service status reports to NCUA showing, at a minimum, the numberof primary potential members of each select group added and the numberof persons from each select group who have actually enrolled as creditunion members. These service status reports can be enlarged to requireinformation concerning aggregate share and loan activity by select groupor participation in other credit union services. In any event, Federalcredit unions using the select group addition method should implement aninformation gathering system early in their addition/diversification programto track their progress in bringing service to the potential members oftheir select groups.This information will help the credit union to operate efficiently andwill give management the data necessary to make decisions about marketingstrategy, new promotions, implementation of new services, etc. The servicestatus reports will enable NCUA to determine which Federal credit unionsare serving newly added groups, as well as any Federal credit unions thatare not serving new groups. If the NCUA determines that a Federal creditunion is not adequately serving new groups, the Regional Director may removethe select group(s) not being served from Section 5 of the credit unioncharter.<ITAG tagnum="84">Chapter 3_Charter Conversions </ITAG>A charter conversion is a change in the jurisdictional authority underwhich a credit union operates. A credit union's charter is the instrumentgiven to the institution by the government, either state or Federal, grantingto it the authority to carry out credit union business in accordance withlaw. Federal credit unions receive their charters from NCUA and are subjectto its supervision, examination, and regulation; they are incorporatedunder Federal law. State-chartered credit unions are incorporated in aparticular state, receiving their charter from the state agency responsiblefor credit unions and subject to the state's supervisory authority. Ifthe state-chartered credit union is federally insured by NCUA, it willalso fall under NCUA's jurisdiction. A Federal credit union's power and authority are principally derived fromthe Federal Credit Union Act and NCUA Rules and Regulations. State-charteredcredit unions are principally governed by state law and regulation. There are two types of charter conversions: Federal charter to state charter,and state charter to Federal charter. Although common bond is not an issuefrom NCUA's standpoint in the case of a Federal to state charter conversion,the procedures and forms relevant to such a conversion have been included.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Conversion of a State Credit Union to a Federal Credit Union</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">A. General Requirements </ITAG>Any state-chartered credit union may apply to convert to a Federal creditunion. In order to do so, it must: 1. Comply with state law regarding conversion; 2. File proof of compliance with NCUA; 3. File a Federal credit union organization certificate; 4. Comply with the requirements of the Federal Credit Union Act, e.g.,common bond and reserve requirements; and 5. Be granted a charter by NCUA. Conversions are treated the same as any initial application for a Federalcharter, including mandatory on-site examination by NUCA. NUCA will alsoconsult with the appropriate state authority regarding the credit union'scurrent condition, management expertise, and past performance. Since theapplicant in a conversion is an ongoing credit union, the economic advisabilityof granting a charter is more readily determinable than in the case ofan initial charter application. A converting state credit union's proposed field of membership must conformto NCUA chartering policy. However, existing members who would not be withinthe revised field of membership will be allowed to retain their membershipafter the conversion. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Submission of Conversion Proposal to NCUA</ITAG>The following actions are to be taken before submitting a conversion proposal:1. The credit union board must approve a proposal for conversion. 2. The Application to Convert (NCUA Form 4401) must be completed. Its purposeis to provide the Regional Director with information on the present operatingpolicies and financial condition of the credit union and the reasons whythe conversion is desired. A continuation sheet may be used if space onthe form is inadequate. Particular attention should be given to answeringthe question on the reasons for conversion. These reasons should be statedin specific terms, not as generalities. 3. The Application must be accompanied by all required attachments. Additionalattachments not specified in the Application include: a. Evidence that the state supervisory authority is either in agreementwith the conversion proposal or, if not in agreement, the reasons therefor;and b. The Application for Insurance of Accounts (Form NCUA 9600) in the caseof a state credit union that is not federally insured. c. The Form 5300_Call Report. d. The most current financial and statistical report.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. NCUA Consideration of the Application to Convert </ITAG>1. <T3>Review by the Regional Director. </T3>The Application will be reviewedto determine that is is complete and that the proposal is in compliancewith Section 125 of the Federal Credit Union Act. This review will includea determination that the state credit union's field of membership is incompliance with NCUA's chartering policies. The Regional Director may makefurther investigation into the proposal and may require the submissionof additional information to support the request to convert. 2. <T3>Examination and Payment of Fees. </T3>NCUA will examine the books andrecords of the credit union on-site. NCUA will charge the credit unionand examination fee. Nonfederally-insured credit unions will also be assessedan application fee. 3. <T3>Conditions to the Approval. </T3>The Regional Director will specifyany special conditions that the credit union must meet in order to proceedwith the conversion. When necessary, this will include changes to the creditunion's field of membership in order to conform to NCUA's chartering policies.4. <T3>Approval by the Regional Director. </T3>The conversion will be approvedby the Regional Director if it is in compliance with Section 125 of theFederal Credit Union Act and meets the criteria for Federal insurance.5. <T3>Notification. </T3>The Regional Director will notify both the creditunion and the state supervisory authority of the decision on the conversion.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Action by Board of Directors</ITAG>Upon being informed of the Regional Director's approval, the board must:1. Comply with all requirements of the state supervisory authority thatwill enable the credit union to convert to a Federal charter and ceasebeing a state credit union; 2. Obtain a letter or official statement from the state supervisory authoritycertifying that the credit union has met all of the state requirementsand will cease to be a state credit union upon its receiving a Federalcharter. A copy of this document must be submitted to the Regional Director;3. Submit a statement of the action taken to comply with any conditionsimposed by the Regional Director in the approval of the conversion proposal.<ITAG tagnum="81">E. Application for a Federal Charter </ITAG>When the Regional Director has received evidence that the board has completedthe actions described in (D) above, the credit union will be authorizedto proceed in making application for a Federal charter. The Regional Director will normally assign a staff member to assist thecredit union in preparing its Application for a Federal Charter (OrganizationCerfiticate, Form NCUA 4008), which will include an application and Agreementsfor Insurance of Accounts (Form NCUA 9500). The Organization Certificate will be submitted to the Regional Director,together with the Application for Insurance. When received by the Regional Director, the proposed Organization Certificatewill constitute the credit union's formal application to become a Federalcredit union. If the application is approved, the credit union may completethe conversion. Denials are appealable to the NCUA Board. <ITAG tagnum="81">F. Completion of the Conversion </ITAG>1. <T3>Effective Date of Conversion. </T3>The date on which the Regional Directorapproves the Organization Certificate and the Application and Agreementsfor Insurance of Accounts is the date on which the credit union becomesa Federal credit union. The Regional Director will forward to the creditunion its Federal charter and Certificate of Insurance and will notifythe state supervisory authority of the date of the conversion. 2. <T3>Assumption of Assets and Liabilities. </T3>As of the effective date,the Federal credit union will be the owner of all of the assets and willbe responsible for all of the liabilities and share accounts of the statecredit union. 3. <T3>Board of Directors' Meeting. </T3>Upon receipt of its Federal charter,the board will hold its first meeting as a Federal credit union. At thismeeting, the board will transact such business as is necessary to completethe conversion as approved and to operate the credit union in accordancewith the requirements of the Federal Credit Union Act and NCUA Rules andRegulations. Actions to be taken at this meeting include: a. Change of the credit union's name on all records, accounts, investments,and other documents evidencing assets or liabilities of the credit union;b. Changes to the credit union's books and records: (1) As of the commencement of business, the accounting system, records,and forms must conform to the standard established by NCUA; (2) New journal and cash record and general ledger pages should be setup. The general ledger accounts for the state credit union will be postedthrough the effective date of the conversion, and the new balances willbe transferred to the new general ledger accounts of the Federal creditunion; (3) The income and expenses accounts of the state credit union will <T3>not </T3>be closed unless the conversion is at the close of an accountingperiod or is required by the state supervisory authority; and (4) The individual share and loan ledger accounts used by the state creditunion may continue to be used. The Federal credit union's name should beproperly reflected on these accounts. 4. <T3>Reports to NCUA.</T3> Within 10 days after commencement of operations,the Federal credit union must submit to the Regional Director the following:a. Report of Officials (NCUA 4501); and b. Financial and Statistical Reports, FCU 109A, 109B, and 109F, or theirequivalent, as of the commencement of business of the Federal credit union.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Conversion of a Federal Credit Union to a State Credit Union</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">A. General Requirements </ITAG>Any Federal credit union may apply to convert to a state credit union.In order to do so, it must:1. Comply with the requirements of the Federal Credit Union Act (Section125) that enable it to convert to a state credit union and to cease beinga Federal credit union; and2. Comply with applicable state law and the requirements of the state supervisoryauthority.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Special Provisions Regarding Federal Share Insurance</ITAG>If the Federal credit union wants to continue Federal share insurance afterthe conversion to a state credit union, it must submit an Application forInsurance of Accounts (Form NCUA 9600) to the Regional Director at thetime it requests approval of the conversion proposal. The Regional Directorhas the authority to approve or disapprove the Application.If the converting Federal credit union does not want to continue Federalshare insurance or if its application for continued insurance is denied,insurance will cease in accordance with the provisions of Section 206 ofthe Federal Credit Union Act.If, upon its conversion to a state credit union, the Federal credit unionwill be terminating its Federal share insurance or converting from Federalto nonfederal share insurance, it must comply with the membership noticeand voting procedures set forth in Section 206 of the Federal Credit UnionAct and Part 708 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations.Where the state credit union will be nonfederally insured, Federal insuranceceases on the effective date of the conversion. If it will be uninsured,then Federal insurance will cease one year after the date of conversionsubject to the restrictions in Section 206(d)(1) of the Federal CreditUnion Act. In either case, the state credit union will be entitled to arefund of the Federal credit union's NCUSIF capitalization deposit andany unused portion of the Federal insurance premium after the final dateon which any of its shares are federally insured.

Ensure that the Regional Director is kept informed as to progress towardconversion and of any material delay or of substantial difficulties whichmay be encountered.If the conversion cannot be completed within the 90-day period, the RegionalDirector should be informed of the reasons for the delay.<ITAG tagnum="81">G. Completion of Conversion</ITAG>In order for the conversion to be completed, the following steps are necessary:1. The baord of directors will submit a copy of the state charter to theRegional Director within 10 days of its receipt. This will be accompaniedby the Federal charter and the Federal insurance certificate. A copy ofthe financial reports (FCU 109A and 109B) as of the preceding month-endshoulod be submitted at this time.2. The Regional Director will notify the credit union and the state supervisoryauthority in writing of the receipt of evidence that the credit union hasbeen authorized to operate as a state credit union.3. The effective date of conversion is the day immediately preceding thedate on which the credit union became a state credit union. The creditunion shall cease to be a Federal credit union as of the effective date.4. If the Regional Director finds a material deviation from the provisionsthat would invalidate any steps taken in the conversion, the credit unionand the state supervisory authority shall be promptly notified in writing.This notice may be either before or after the copy of the state charterif filed with the Regional Director. The notice will inform the creditunion as to the nature of the adverse findings. The conversion will notbe effected and completed until the improper actions and steps have beencorrected.5. Upon ceasing to be a Federal credit union, the credit union shall nolonger be subject to any of the provisions of the Federal Credit UnionAct, except as may apply if Federal share insurance coverage is continued.The successor state credit union shall be immediately vested with all ofthe assets and shall continue to be responsible for all of the obligationsof the Federal credit union to the same extent as though the conversionhad not taken place.
