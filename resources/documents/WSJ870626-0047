The oil cartel, meeting in Vienna, Austria, adjourned its conference after about two hours and will meet again today.    After yesterday's session, Iran's oil minister, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, said the daily oil production ceiling for the fourth quarter of 18.3 million barrels, which was tentatively approved by OPEC in December, &quot;is out of the question&quot; and is &quot;not serious.&quot;    The comments led some traders to buy back contracts they had sold earlier in the week, analysts said. &quot;Trepidation about fourth-quarter output touched off some nervous buying,&quot; said Steven Platt, oil analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.    Chart-guided technical buying added to the day's gains, traders and brokers said.    Crude oil for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 24 cents, to $19.64 a barrel. Heating oil and unleaded gasoline futures prices posted more modest gains.    Iran leads a group of OPEC members that are looking for higher prices and believe the current production quota of about 15.8 million barrels a day should be frozen. Still, some traders had expected Iran to accede to the more moderate OPEC members and agree to staggered production increases for the rest of the year, some analysts said.    &quot;Now it seems the Iranians are quite adamant that the fourth-quarter level should be lowered,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, energy futures analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York. &quot;It looks like it will be extremely difficult to get OPEC's fixed price changed, so the Iranians are looking to get higher prices through the back door by lowering production,&quot; Mr. Barakat said.    OPEC ministers seem intent on maintaining the cartel's current fixed price of about $18 a barrel. In December the ministers agreed to raise the group's output to 16.6 million barrels a day in the third quarter and to 18.3 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter.    However, the fourth-quarter production level probably will remain the focal point of the current meeting, analysts said.    &quot;That's the only item open for debate,&quot; said James Ritterbusch, vice president, energy futures, at PaineWebber Inc. in Chicago. &quot;If they don't address the production level, the market could be in store for a pullback.&quot;    In other futures markets yesterday:    COTTON: Demand was strong, and futures recovered from Wednesday's declines to close higher. Yesterday morning the Agriculture Department reported record daily cotton consumption in the U.S. last month of 29,300 bales, up from 28,700 in April and 25,152 in May 1986. Last month's consumption rate was the highest since 1974, said Richard LeGardeur, cotton trader at Thomson McKinnon Securities, Inc. in New Orleans. &quot;This is a demand-driven market,&quot; Smith Barney's Mr. Barakat said. Traders thought Wednesday's decline was overdone and when the consumption report came out, the market rose sharply, he said. After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department reported 1,500 bales in new sales from the current crop in the week ended June 18. This brought the total commitment from the 1986-87 harvest to almost 6.7 million bales, of which 5.6 million already have been shipped. New sales from the 1987-88 crop, which will begin August 1, amounted to 141,200 bales, and that brought the total commitment to almost 2.3 million bales. The weekly export sales for the new crop &quot;show an excellent foreign appetite for U.S. cotton and were far higher than had been expected,&quot; Mr. LeGardeur said. The report was expected to show exports ranging between 80,000 and 120,000 bales, he said.    STOCK INDEXES: A stronger dollar and rising bond futures buoyed prices in stock-index futures markets, leading traders to predict a follow-through rally today. &quot;The contracts look good, they could even move a little higher based on the amount of cash around for end-of-the-quarter investing,&quot; said Peter Grennan, head of the stock index futures department at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York. Reflecting the blue-chip leadership in the current stock market rally, the Major Market Index of 20 large stocks set a high yesterday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average set its own high of 2451.05, up 22.64. Although the broader Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index future closed below its day's high, it may test that 313.5 level in today's trading, Mr. Grennan said. A trader in the Sandamp;P 500 stock-index future trading pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange estimated that the September Sandamp;P 500 contract may shoot as high as 322 by July 4th, despite the relatively modest trading volume of the past few sessions.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Heavier-than-expected rains in Iowa Wednesday night and late-morning showers yesterday dampened traders' spirits, sending grain and soybean futures prices lower. Initial weakness in foreign currencies against the dollar also weighed against grain and soybeans, which depend in part on exports. A stronger dollar makes sales abroad more expensive. Meanwhile, forecasts for a cool, dry weekend burdened corn prices, which is approaching its pollination stage. The predicted conditions &quot;would be ideal weather&quot; for the crop, said Ted Mao, a Shearson analyst. </TEXT></DOC>
