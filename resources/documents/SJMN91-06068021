The Scud appeared, the Patriots streaked up --zap! the explosion lighted up the sky, and the world breathed its relief atthe marvel of our missile defense.;    &quot;Forty-two Scuds engaged, 41intercepted,&quot; President Bush told proud workers at the plant producing thePatriots.;    His televised visit delivered an unmistakable message: theterror weapon Saddam Hussein aimed at civilians was being effectivelycountered by space-age American technology.;    The president's statisticswere accurate but his message is subject to challenge. The interceptions --those great midair explosions that thrilled us all -- did not, in many andperhaps most cases, stop the Scuds from delivering their payload of highexplosives.;    The Patriot interceptions made a lot of noise and fireworksbut may not often have hit their targets on the destructive nose. If so, whatdid the Patriots hit?;    Fuel tanks. Most Scuds began to break up on re-entryinto the atmosphere, about 15 to 12 kilometers in the air; at that droppingstage the warhead no longer needs the fuel tank; the explosive payload is wellon its way to the target area.;    Too many of the Patriots attacked thelarger target -- the detached fuel tank -- making a satisfying bang, while theuntouched warhead continued down and slammed home.;    Our militarymisleadingly called such useless contact &quot;mission kills&quot; on the theory thatthe explosion might have deflected the warhead from its intended target.;   But that explanation does not add up. If a warhead is targeted at a wide areaof 9 square kilometers, as the inaccurate Scuds are, what does it matter ifthe warhead is knocked off course a kilometer or two? It does the sameterror-damage it was intended to do, but on a different neighborhood.;    Bywar's end, the Iraqis launched about 85 Scuds.;    Estimates vary, but 10 hitIsrael before the Patriots arrived; about 25 veered off into the Israeli orSaudi desert or into the drink. According to executives at Raytheon, thePatriot's builder, 50 Scuds were engaged and 49 intercepted.;    The payloadis the payoff: Did the Patriots hit the Scuds early enough to prevent a rainof destruction? No. Did that rain often contain Scud warheads? Yes.;    &quot;TheSaudis have not been all that forthcoming publicly. But clearly the Patriotwas an asset, and absolutely vital in keeping Israel out of the war,&quot; says ahigh administration official.;    Psychology triumphed over technology.;   Why did the Scud, a terror weapon that delivered many of its warheads, fail toterrorize?;    The ironic reason: The Patriot, even if investigators find itfailed in its military mission to kill warheads, averted Saudi panic andIsraeli need for reprisal by providing a false sense of security.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  WILLIAM SAFIRE  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910308  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  506  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday March 8, 199100068021,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
