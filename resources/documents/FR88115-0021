Introduction</ITAG>On January 15, 1987, 52 FR 1858, the Minerals Management Service (MMS)of the Department of the Interior issued a notice of proposed rulemakingto amend the regulations governing the valuation of oil from Federal leasesonshore and on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), and from Indian Tribaland allotted leases. During the public comment period, MMS received over100 written comments. In addition, public hearings were held in Lakewood,Colorado, on March 4, 1987, and in New Orleans, Louisiana, on March 17,1987. Sixteen persons made oral presentations at those hearings.Because of the complexity of the regulations, and in accordance with MMS'sunderstanding with Congress, MMS issued a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemakingon August 17, 1987 (52 FR 30826), which included as an appendix MMS's draftof the final regulations. The purpose of the further notice of proposedrulemaking was to obtain further public comment during a short commentperiod and then to make any necessary revisions to the final regulations.See Conference Report on H.R. 1827, in the <T3>Congressional Record </T3>dated June 27, 1987, at pages H5651-H5666.The public comment period on the First Further Notice of Proposed Rulemakingwas scheduled to close on September 2, 1987, but was extended to September11, 1987 (52 FR 33247, September 2, 1987). On September 21, 1987, MMS issueda Notice of Intent to Issue a Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(52 FR 35451). In that Notice, MMS stated that all comments received onthe Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and the first draft final ruleswould be included in the rulemaking record for this rule, even if theywere received after September 11.In addition to receiving written comments on the first draft final rules,MMS held several meetings with representatives from the States, Indianlessors and industry in an effort to develop a set of regulations whichwere acceptable generally to all groups, though not a panacea for any oneof them. Each of the groups exhibited a commendable willingness to makepositive contributions to the process and, where necessary, to reach compromises.In a further effort to ensure that all of the interested constituencieshad a full and fair opportunity to comment upon the gas valuation rulesfollowing the several meetings and MMS's review of the written comments,MMS issued a Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and second draftfinal rules (52 FR 39846, October 23, 1987). Public comments were receivedfor 30 days. Over 25 additional comments were submitted in response tothe second further notice of proposed rulemaking. Many commenters repeatedcomments that had been submitted in response to earlier requests for comments.However, MMS did receive additional comments, particularly on sectionsthat were changed. All comments were reviewed and considered in draftingthe final rule.MMS has considered carefully all of the public comments received duringthis rulemaking process, which included draft rules and input from theRoyalty Management Advisory Committee (RMAC), proposed rules, and furthernotices of proposed rulemaking with draft final rules. A complete accountof the RMAC process is included in the preamble to the proposed regulationsissued in January 1987. Based on its review, MMS hereby adopts final regulationsgoverning the valuation of oil from Federal and Indian leases. These regulationswill apply prospectively to production on or after the effective date specifiedin the <T2>EFFECTIVE DATE </T2>section of this preamble.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Purpose and Background</ITAG>The MMS is revising the current regulations regarding the valuation ofoil to accomplish the following:(1) Clarification and reorganization of the existing regulations at 30CFR Parts 202, 203, 206, 207, 210, 241, and 43 CFR Parts 3100 and 3160.(2) Creation of regulations consistent with the present organizationalstructure of the Department of the Interior (DOI).(3) Placement of the oil royalty valuation regulations in a format compatiblewith the valuation regulations for all leasable minerals.(4) Clarification that royalty is to be paid on all consideration receivedby lessees, less applicable allowances, for lease production.(5) Creation of regulations to guide the lessee in the determination ofallowable transportation costs for oil to aid in the calculation of properroyalty due the lessor.Structurally, these regulations include the reorganization of Parts 202,203, 206, 207, 210, and 241. Each part is reorganized by redesignating``Subpart B_Oil and Gas, General'' as ``Subpart B_Oil, Gas, and OCS Sulfur,General''; ``Subpart C_Oil and Gas, Onshore'' as ``Subpart C_Federal andIndian Oil''; and ``Subpart D_Oil, Gas, and Sulfur, Offshore'' as ``SubpartD_Federal and Indian Gas.''Also, a number of sections are renumbered and/or moved to a new subpart.In addition, new andSection;andSection; 202.51, 202.101, 206.103, 206.104,207.1, 207.2, 207.5, and 210.55 are added to the appropriate parts andsubparts.Current andSection; 206.104 is an onshore operational regulation which isunder the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). This sectionis being redesignated as 43 CFR 3162.7-4, and the existing andSection; 3162.7-4is being redesignated as andSection; 3162.7-5. Also, in order to avoid anyinconsistencies between these final rules and the BLM rules, 43 CFR 3103.3-1is being revised by deleting subsections (c) and (d) and redesignatingexisting subsection (3) as new subsection (c).This rule applies prospectively to production on or after the effectivedate specified in the <T2>EFFECTIVE DATE </T2>section of this preamble. It supersedes all existingoil royalty valuation directives contained in numerous Secretarial, MineralsManagement Service, and U.S. Geological Survey Conservation Division (nowBureau of Land Management, Onshore Operations) orders, directives, regulationsand Notice to Lessees (NTL's) issued over past years. Specific guidelinesgoverning reporting requirements consistent with these new oil valuationregulations will be incorporated into the MMS Payor Handbook. For the convenience of oil and gas lessees, payors, and the public, thefollowing chart summarizes the effects of these rules.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1>Regulation changes </H1><H1>Descriptions</H1>I.

The same principle appliesto Federal leases. A separate oil definitions section applicable to the royalty valuationof oil is included in this rulemaking in Part 206. All definitions containedunder each subpart of Part 206 will be applicable to the regulations containedin Parts 202, 203, 207, 210, and 241. Because the definitions are specificto these parts, they may not necessarily conform to definitions of thesame terms in other Federal agencies' regulations.<ITAG tagnum="85">III. Response to General Comments Received on Proposed Oil ProductValuation Regulations and Related Topics</ITAG>The notice of proposed oil valuation regulations was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on January 15, 1987 (52 FR 1858). This was followedby a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (52 FR 30826, August 17, 1987),and a Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (52 FR 39846, October23, 1987). Over 150 comments were received from interested persons includingIndian lessors, the States, and industry.The commenters included industry/trade groups, State, local, and Federalgovernmental entities, Indian Tribes or allottees, a State/Tribal association,and an individual. The MMS received many diverse comments on the principles underlying theproposed valuation methodology. These comments did not address specificsections of the proposed regulations. The respondents generally comprisedtwo groups, with industry generally on one side and States and Indianson the opposing side. The general comments were categorized into five more-or-lessinterrelated issues: (1) Acceptance of gross proceeds under an arm's-lengthcontract, or the benchmark, as the value for royalty purposes; (2) deductionof transportation costs; (3) legal mandates and responsibilities towardIndians; (4) complexity and obscurity of regulations and definitions; and(5) economic impacts.(1) Acceptance of gross proceeds as the value for royalty purpose Industry commenters generally agreed that the basic premise underlyingthe proposed rulemaking is sound because value is best determined by theinteraction of competing market forces. However, State and Indian commentersdisagreed, particularly objecting to the concept of accepting gross proceedsreceived under arm's-length transactions as representative of market value.The commenters were concerned that the acceptance of gross proceeds, withoutadditional testing of its validity, could lead to manipulation of pricingschedules, an erosion of payors' accountability and, in general, wouldfail to protect the interests of the lessor. Many pointed out that grossproceeds has historically not been considered equivalent to market value,citing various legal opinions in support. In view of this, State and Indiancommenters declared that royalty value should be equivalent to the highestprice posted for like-quality production in a field or area.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS's experience demonstrates that the highestprice posted in a given field does not necessarily reflect a bona fideoffer to purchase, nor does it reflect that significant quantities of oilare being purchased at that price. In these regulations, MMS generallywill assess royalty on the value to which the lessee is legally entitledunder its arm's-length contract. MMS maintains that gross proceeds to whicha lessee is legally entitled under arm's-length contracts are determinedby market forces and thus represent the best measure of market value. Formany Indian leases, MMS will also require consideration of the highestprice paid for a major portion of production in accordance with the leaseterms.To assure that gross proceeds represent market value, and thus insure accountability,Indian and State commenters suggested that reported gross proceeds valuesshould be tested/validated by using the net-back (work-back) procedureas an independent crosscheck. They also suggested that royalty reportingshould be routinely monitored by using this procedure.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS believes that gross proceeds under arm's-lengthcontracts are representative of market value. However, MMS will continueto monitor value determinations under its regulations to ensure that thosedeterminations yield reasonable values. To routinely perform labor-intensivenet-back calculations is impractical.Some State respondents doubted that the benchmark hierarchy system fordetermining values under non-arm's-length transactions could be properlyapplied because of the system's complexity and because the valuation procedureis predicated upon a payor's ability and willingness to identify a transactionas either arm's-length or non-arm's-length. They feared that industry mightbe reluctant to identify non-arm's-length transactions and thus merelydeclare gross proceeds as value, thereby placing the burden of proper findingupon MMS during audit.   <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS supports the benchmark system. Most of industry,those who report under the system, believe it to be a workable system.In general, industry can identify its own arm's-length contracts basedon standards established in these regulations and it is in its best interestsnot to classify non-arm's-length transactions as arm's-length because ofthe threat of both high interest costs and possible penalties. However,MMS will use the audit process to verify that contracts which are claimedto be arm's-length satisfy all the standards of the definition, discussedin detail below.   (2) Deduction of Transportations Costs   Although industry commenters supported the proposed deductions for transportationcosts, many of the respondents believed the allowable deductions were toorestrictive, and one suggested that transportation allowances should beactual costs based on Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) tariffsor arm's-length transportation arrangements. However, comments from Statesand Indians objected to the allowances as being too liberal and unnecessarilyopen-ended by effectively granting the allowances regardless of need. Theysuggested that transportation deductions should be allowed only when transportationcosts are necessary to the sale of the production, that transportationallowances should be limited to OCS production only, or that no deductionsshould be allowed, at least for tribal lands.   <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS believes that costs incurred by a lesseeto transport lease production to a delivery point off the lease increasesits value and, therefore, is a recognized deduction. See the transportationallowance section of this preamble for further discussion.   (3) Legal Mandates and Responsibilities Toward Indians   Some State and Indian respondents questioned the legality of the proposedrulemaking, expressing their view that the proposed modifications, particularlywith respect to arm's-length contracts and gross proceeds, are contraryto the intent of the valuation requirements of the Mineral Lands LeasingAct, 30 U.S.C. 181 <T3>et seq., </T3>and the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of1982 (FOGRMA), 30 U.S.C. 1701 <T3>et seq., </T3>and are a marked departure from historical valuationregulations and lease terms. Their basic argument is that the statutesrequire royalty based on the value of production, and a royalty clausebased upon ``value'' is not satisfied by a valuation procedure based upongross proceeds; in their opinion, value may be considerably higher thanrevenues from arm's-length transactions.   <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The regulations generally define value on the basisof market transactions, consistent with commonly held economic philosophy,rather than some arbitrary ``value'' which can be easily misconstrued,disputed, or misinterpreted. The MMS believes there is no conflict betweenthe intent of the Mineral Lands Leasing Act, FOGRMA, and the valuationprocedures being adopted herein.   The mineral leasing laws require that the Secretary receive a royalty onthe ``value of production'' from minerals produced from Federal lands,but value is a word without precise definition. ``Men have all but driventhemselves mad in an effort to definitize its meaning.'' <T3>Andrews v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </T3>135 F.2d 314, 317(2d Cir. 1943). The word ``value'' has sometimes been modified by the words``fair market'', although the mineral leasing law provisions on ``valueof production'' do not include these words. But, these adjectives do notreally clarify the word ``value.'' The word ``fair'' can modify the word``value'' as in ``fair value'' or it can modify the word market as in ``fairmarket.'' The term ``fair value'' may not be interpreted the same as the``fair market'' value. The term ``fair market value,'' however, has beengenerally accepted to be the price received by a willing and knowledgeableseller not obligated to sell from a willing and knowledgeable buyer notobligated to buy. Willing, knowledgeable, and obligated are again adjectiveswhich are not terms of precise definition. These general concepts, however,were still the general principles which were followed in drafting theseregulations on valuation of production for the purpose of calculating royalties.The general presumption is that persons buying or selling products fromFederal and Indian leases are willing, knowledgeable, and not obligatedto buy or sell. Because the U.S. economy is built upon a system in whichindividuals are provided the opportunity to advance their individual selfinterest, this seems to be a reasonable presumption. This system and itsreliance on self-motivated individuals to engage in transactions whichare to their own best interest, therefore, is a cornerstone of the regulations.         The purpose of these regulations is to define the value of production,for royalty purposes, for production from Federal and Indian lands. Valuecan be determined in different ways, and these rules explain how valueis to be established in different circumstances. Value in these regulationsgenerally is determined by prices set by individuals of opposing economicinterests transacting business between themselves. Prices received forthe sale of products from Federal and Indian leases pursuant to ``arm's-lengthcontracts,'' in many instances, are accepted as value for royalty purposes.However, even for some arm's-length contracts, contract prices may notbe used for value purposes if the lease terms provide for other measuresof value (such as Indian leases) or when there is a reason to suspect thebona fide nature of a particular transaction. Even the alternative valuationmethods, however, are determined by reference to prices received by individualsbuying or selling like-quality products in the same general area who haveopposing economic interests. Also, in no instance can value be less thanthe amount received by a lessee in a particular transaction.    The Indian commenters took particular exception to the proposed rulemaking,pointing out that the proposed valuation procedures based on gross proceedsare in conflict with the Secretary's duty under the Unallotted Indian LeasingAct of 1938 and the Indian Mineral Development Act of 1982 to ensure thattribes and allottees receive the maximum return for their property. Theydisagreed that gross proceeds represented market value, and thus believedthey would not receive the maximum benefit accruable from production pursuantto statutes. One respondent suggested that the proposed regulations applyprospectively only to newly issued leases so that royalties owed to Tribesand allottees under existing regulations would not be diminished.    <T3>MMS Response: </T3>MMS believes the new valuation regulations, withthe changes discussed in more detail below, are fully consistent with theSecretary's obligations to Indian lessors.    (4) Complexity and Obscurity of Regulations and Definitions    Some commenters believed that the proposed rulemaking generally was excessivelycomplicated, leading to difficulty in interpretation. As a result, theybelieve the proposed rules fail to achieve the stated goals of simplificationand providing certainty.    <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS has endeavored to correct certain identifieddeficiencies in the final rulemaking. The regulations combine previousregulations, NTL's, orders, and internal policies. They will provide asingle source for product value guidance which necessarily will be simplerand more comprehensive than the existing procedures.    (5) Economic Impacts    State and Indian commenters disagreed with MMS's statement that the proposedregulations would yield long-term benefits to royalty owners. Indian commenters,in particular, believed the proposed valuation rules would have a significantdetrimental economic impact on Tribes and allottees. A detailed analysisof the economic impacts of the proposed rules was suggested by one commenterto support MMS's claim that the short-term effects on revenues would belimited.    <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS believes that the regulations provide valuationcriteria that will result in reasonable values and will create an atmosphereof certainty in royalty payments and thereby correct some of the royaltydeficiencies encountered in the past.    The Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking of August 17, 1987 (52 FR 30826),and the Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking of October 23, 1987(52 FR 39846), specifically requested comments on certain broad issues,and the Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking also specificallyrequested comments on certain individual issues. Because the response toboth the broad and specific issues were also addressed in the Preambleto the Final Gas Valuation Regulations published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>, reviewers are directed to the responses providedin the Preamble to that rulemaking.    The MMS will monitor the operation and effect of the rules being adoptedtoday. In 3 years, MMS will review the results of its analysis to determineif any significant changes to the regulations are required. In the meantime,technical and minor adjustments to the rules will be made as necessary.   <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Section-by-Section Analysis and Response to Comments    </ITAG>Comments were not received on every section of the proposed regulations.Therefore, if any of those sections were not changed significantly fromthe proposal, there generally is no further discussion in this preamble.The preamble to the proposed regulation (52 FR 1858, January 15, 1987)may be consulted for a full description of the purpose of those sections.For other sections, this preamble will address primarily the extent towhich the final rule was changed from the proposal. Again, a complete discussionof the applicable sections may be found in the preamble to the proposedregulation.    Section 202.52 Royalties.    For purposes of clarity, one State commenter suggested that the word ``royalty''be inserted before the words ``rate specified'', and the words ``amountof royalty'' be deleted and replaced with the words ``royalty rate.'' Thissuggestion was made because some lessees have confused the computationof royalty rate and the computation of the amount of royalties due.   <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS agrees that these suggested changes shouldbe made for purposes of clarity and the final rule has been modified accordingly.   The MMS has removed from the final rules the two sections addressing thegeneral responsibilities of MMS and lessees. All of these responsibilitiesare addressed in various provisions of 30 CFR and elsewhere. Thus, thesesections were duplicative and, based on the comments received, caused confusion.               Section 202.100 Royalty on oil.Indian commenters recommended that paragraph (a) should provide specificallythat Indian lessors, as well as MMS, have the right to require paymentin-kind for royalties due on production.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>Most Indian lessors have the authority to requirepayment in-kind for royalties due on production. To the extent the leaseterms so provide, the lessor may take its royalty-in-kind. However, becauserequests to take royalty-in-kind may involve operational difficulties forthe lessee, as well as a change in accounting and reporting proceduresnecessary for MMS to properly monitor royalty obligations, MMS will continueto administer such requests. Therefore, if an Indian lessor wants royalty-in-kind,he or she must contact MMS. The MMS then will make arrangements with thelessee for the in-kind payment. The MMS also has added a provision clarifying that when royalties are paidin value, the royalties due are equal to the value for royalty purposesmultiplied by the royalty rate.Industry commenters recommended that this section state that no permissionis necessary to exempt from royalty any oil used for the benefit of thelease, either on-lease or off-lease, and including communitized or unitizedareas. In addition, another industry commenter stated that where agencyapproval is necessary, this section should address the procedure to acquiresuch permission.Some Indian commenters also recommended that any royalty-free use of oilbe subject to prior approval to ensure that production from Indian leasesis not disproportionately used in royalty-free operations. One Indian commenterobjected to any off-lease use of oil that would be royalty free.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The royalty-free use of oil is an operational mattercovered by the appropriate operating regulations of the BLM and MMS foronshore and OCS operations, respectively. The BLM requirements are governedby the provisions of Notice to Lessees and Operators No. 4A. Therefore,although these comments raised many substantive issues, they are not properlyaddressed in this rulemaking. The MMS does not believe that prior approvalfor royalty-free use of oil is warranted because most leases by their specificterms allow royalty-free use of oil and it is a matter which will be reviewedduring audits to prevent abuse.One industry commenter proposed that MMS consider expansion of andSection;202.100(b) to include appropriate royalty deductions for the oil equivalentcost of alternative fuels which may also be used for beneficial purposeson the lease.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>This suggestion was not adopted. This issue is moreproperly directed to operational regulations, not value regulations, andis outside the scope of this rule. The MMS has included these provisionssimply to reflect the general lease terms and regulatory provisions whichprescribe the royalty obligation. Proposed andSection; 202.100(b), which addressed royalty-free use of oilfor leases committed to unit or communitization agreements, has been expandedin the final rules to also cover production facilities handling productionfrom more than one lease with the approval of the appropriate agency. AlthoughMMS is satisfied that this issue is an operational matter governed sufficientlyby the appropriate operation of the unit agreement or communitization agreementand BLM's and MMS's regulations, the number of comments received regardingthis issue led MMS to believe that reiterating these operational requirementswas advisable. This regulation simply provides that a disproportionateshare of the fuel consumed at a production facility serving multiple leasesmay not be allocated to an individual lease without incurring a royaltyobligation on a portion of the fuel.A State commenter suggested changes designed to help end the confusionabout the distinction between computing the royalty rate and computingthe amount of royalties due. MMS has adopted some changes to the wordingof andSection;andSection; 202.100(a) and (b) for clarity. Section 202.100(c) was proposed as andSection; 206.100(d). A comment wasreceived from industry suggesting the addition of the phrase ``becauseof negligence of lessee'' after the words ``offshore lease,'' in orderto be consistent with section 308 of FOGRMA.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>This subpart addresses the valuation of oil whichhas been determined to be ``avoidably lost,'' not the reason(s) for thatdetermination. Determination of ``avoidably lost'' and ``negligence'' isa function of MMS OCS Operations for OCS leases and BLM for onshore Federaland Indian leases. The BLM's requirements are governed by the provisionsof 43 CFR Part 3160 and Notice to Lessees and Operators No. 4A. The MMS'srequirements are governed by 30 CFR Part 250. The addition of the recommendedphrase, therefore, is considered inappropriate for inclusion in this rulemaking.Section 202.100(d) requires royalties to be paid on insurance compensationfor unavoidably lost oil. Several industry commenters stated that to requirea lessee to pay royalties on any compensation received through insurancecoverage or other arrangements for oil unavoidably lost is unfair. Theystated that insurance proceeds are not received for the sale of productionand should not be subject to sharing with the lessor. They believe, however,that if MMS insists on collecting a portion of such proceeds, the costof such insurance coverage should be allowed as a deduction from royalty.MMS removed the insurance compensation section from the first draft finalrule. Many Indian and State commenters thought this change was unfair,stating that if the lessee was compensated for the production, the lessorshould then receive its royalty share.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS has reinstated this provision in the finalrules. However, royalties are due only if the lessee receives insurancecompensation from a third person. No royalty is due where the lessee self-insures.The MMS has added at andSection; 202.100(e) of the final rules a provisionconcerning production governed by a federally approved unitization or communitizationagreement. Section 202.100(e) states that all agreement production attributableto a Federal or Indian lease in accordance with the terms of the agreementis subject to the royalty payment and reporting requirements of Title 30of the Code of Federal Regulations even if an agreement participant actuallytaking the production is not the lessee of the Federal or Indian lease.Only a few concerns were expressed about this requirement and many commenterssupported it. Most important, however, andSection; 202.100(e) requires generallythat the value, for royalty purposes, of this production be determinedin accordance with 30 CFR Part 206 under the circumstances involved inthe actual disposition of the production. For example, if a Federal lesseedoes not sell or otherwise dispose of its allocable share of unit production,then it will be sold or otherwise disposed of by other unit participants.If one of the unit participants other than the Federal lessee transportsthe oil to a terminal off the unit area under an arm's-length transportationagreement and then sells the oil under an arm's-length sales contract,the value, for royalty purposes, will be that person's gross proceeds lessthe costs of transportation incurred under the arm's-length transportationagreement. This provision does not address the issue of what person mustreport and pay the royalties, it only addresses the issue of valuation.These rules do not require non-Federal and non-Indian lessees to conformto these regulations for valuing production. The MMS merely has requiredthat the lessee must determine its royalty liability in accordance withthe other interest owners' contracts or proceeds as long as those royaltiescomply with these value regulations. Any balancing problem that may existbecause of interest owners taking more than their entitlement is a matterto be settled by the agreement members.The MMS has added a new subparagraph (3) to the final rules to clarifythat all agreement participants actually taking volumes in excess of theirallocated share of production in any month are deemed to have taken ratablyfrom all persons taking less than their proportionate share. The MMS decidedthat such a provision was required to provide certainty as to which unitparticipants' dispositions the lessee must consider to satisfy the requirementsof this provision, especially where there is no balancing agreement amongthe unit participants.Some industry commenters also stated that the foreseeable results of thisparagraph include: (1) Chronic late payments of royalties; (2) inconsistentAFS and PAAS reporting; (3) difficulty in determining proper royalty valueswhere the overproduced working interest owners dispose of production pursuantto non-arm's-length transactions; and (4) excessive accounting and administrativecosts for MMS and all working interest owners.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS believes that lessees generally will beable to comply with the requirements of the regulations. However, MMS hasadded a new subparagraph (2) which authorizes MMS to approve a royaltyvaluation method different from that prescribed by subparagraph (1) tovalue any volumes of agreement production allocated to a lessee but whichthe lessee does not take. The lessee must request the exception and MMSmay approve it only if it is consistent with the purposes of the regulations.For example, under a unit agreement a Federal lessee may be entitled to1,000 barrels of production. It is required to pay royalty on that volume.However, it only is able to sell 750 barrels that month. The lessee couldrequest that MMS allow it to pay royalty on the remaining 250 barrels atits contract price.The MMS recognizes that under most balancing agreements, a lessee who hasunder taken at some point will over take to balance its account. Sincethe lessee was required to pay royalties on the value of its allocatedshare when it under took, the lessee is not required to pay additionalroyalties for prior periods for that lease when it subsequently over takes.Again, royalties are due only on the allocated share of agreement productioneven when the lessee takes and sells a greater volume. The MMS has addeda new subparagraph (4) to clarify this issue.Some industry commenters recommended that paying and reporting royaltiesbe accomplished solely on the basis of sales. According to these comments,because royalties will have been paid on total sales from the leases, thereshould be no decrease in royalty payments due over the life of the leasethrough the use of the sales approach.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>Paying and reporting royalty solely on the basisof sales would not conform to the requirements of the federally approvedagreement or the terms of the lease. It also could cause a hardship forIndian lessors who rely on a steady stream of revenues when there is productionfrom their leases. Therefore, it is not an acceptable procedure.In response to comments that the valuation method for production from unitizationand communitization agreements required by the proposed and draft rulescould cause royalty calculation and reporting problems for lessees, MMSis including in the final rules in subsection (f) an exception authorityfor valuing production from Federal and Indian leases committed to agreements.The authority is discretionary and may be exercised where the lessee requestsan alternative method, the proposal is consistent with applicable statutes,lease terms and agreement terms, to the extent practical persons with aninterest in the agreement are notified and given an opportunity to comment,and, to the extent practical all persons with an interest in a Federalor Indian lease committed to the agreement agree to use the proposed method.Section 206.100 Purpose and scope.One industry commenter agreed with the concept that Indian Tribal and allottedleases be treated under the same oil valuation standards applied to Federalleases unless the specific lease terms require otherwise. That commenteralso suggested that MMS support Indian Tribes and allottees, if requested,in marketing their royalty share of production. An Indian Tribe commenterasserted that it may be inconsistent to use the same oil valuation standardsfor Indian and Federal leases: ``Because of the trust responsibility ofthe United States to maximize Indian royalties, it may be inconsistentto have Indian and Federal leases treated the same under this section,especially if the policy of Interior is to earn a reasonable and long-termmaximum rate of return and revenues for all parties.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS believes generally that maintaining a singleset of oil valuation regulations that apply to both Federal and Indianlands (except leases on the Osage Indian Reservation) provides for consistencyand certainty in the determination of the value of oil for all lands administeredby the DOI and will result in obtaining a reasonable and appropriate rateof return to all parties concerned. However, because of the lease termsof many Indian leases, MMS has included in the rules some additional valuationstandards applicable only to those Indian leases.MMS has added a general statement that the purpose of these rules is toestablish the value of production for royalty purposes consistent withthe mineral leasing laws, other applicable laws, and lease terms.In accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, where the provisionsof any statute, treaty, lease or settlement agreement are inconsistentwith these regulations, the lease, statute, treaty or settlement agreementprovision will govern to the extent of that inconsistency. This policyalso applies to court decisions_regulatory revisions will be required tothe extent of any inconsistency with the existing regulations, providedthey are not ambiguous or unclear in their intent. Thus, MMS maintainsthe DOI's responsibility to Indians by assuring that the regulations donot supersede the authority granted by the lease, or violate provisionsof a statute, treaty, or court decision.Several Indian respondents commented on andSection; 206.100(b). One suggestedthat the proposed rules should expressly recognize that ``where provisionsof any Indian lease, or any statute or treaty affecting Indian leases,as stated or <T3>as interpreted by the courts, </T3>are inconsistent with the regulations,then the lease, statute or treaty, or <T3>court interpretation </T3>would govern to the extent of the inconsistency.''Another commenter expressed the view that ``caution should be exercisedbefore stating that `the lease * * * provision shall govern to the extentof that inconsistency.' Many Indian allottee and tribal leases are veryold and were entered into when industry practices were very different thanthey are now. The parties to the lease may have understood the lease toincorporate standard industry practice at that time. For this reason, someprovisions may have been omitted from the written instrument. It may beproper to interpret some of those unwritten provisions in light of today'sstandards, but it may be grossly unfair to the royalty owner to so interpretothers. One such example may be transportation costs. If transportationcosts were not being deducted from royalties when the lease was enteredinto, transportation costs should not be deducted now, even though notmentioned in the lease. It is our conclusion that this should be consideredand the regulations should make some mention of this consideration.'' Anothercommenter suggested including settlement agreements entered into to resolveadministrative or judicial litigation because these agreements may varyfrom the rules.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>Obviously, MMS will comply with court orders andjudicial decisions which affect these regulations. It is well known, however,that court decisions often focus only on parts of issues, leaving thosedecisions open to interpretation. Furthermore, a court's jurisdiction canlimit the applicability of its decision. It is for these reasons that MMShas elected not to include an express reference to court decisions or courtinterpretations in this or any other subpart of these regulations.Contrary to the interpretation of this section by the second commenter,the regulations will not change any specific lease provisions. The MMShas included the suggested reference to settlement agreements.Few comments were received concerning andSection; 206.100(c). One from industryendorsed the recommendation of the Royalty Management Advisory Committee(RMAC) Oil Valuation Panel which proposes placing a limit on the time periodduring which MMS may conduct an audit on a lease. It asserted that sucha limitation ``encourages prompt action, assures the retention of appropriaterecords, and gives the lessee assurance that its current business willnot be disrupted by examinations of very remote payments. We believe a6-year limitation is reasonable for both MMS and the lessee.''The Indian respondent is concerned that ``Although all royalty paymentsmade to MMS will purportedly be subject to later audit and adjustment,MMS's past audit record does not reassure the tribes that all royaltiesdue will be collected.''<T3>MMS Response:</T3> These regulations concern valuation procedures,not accounting functions. All MMS audits are subject to the requirementsfound at 30 CFR 217.50, which does not specify any time limit during whichMMS may conduct an audit. Because the reference in andSection; 206.100(c)is intended only to be a general reminder that royalty payments will beaudited, the recommendation to place a time limit on audits was not adopted.The MMS has modified the provision in the final rule to make it clear thatthis provision applies to payments made directly to Indian Tribes or allotteesas well as those made to MMS either for Federal or Indian leases. MMS willaddress the issue of audit closure elsewhere.Several Indian commenters suggested that MMS should amend andSection; 206.100(d)to specifically refer to the Secretary's trust responsibility to the Indians.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS has made the suggested change.The MMS received a comment from an Alaska Native Corporation stating thatMMS should not make the new regulations applicable to an Alaska NativeCorporation's proportionate share of leases acquired under section 14(g)of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, 43 U.S.C. 1613(g). Under section 14(g), a native corporation can acquire all or part of thelease. The commenter's point was that, at the time a proportionate interestin a lease is acquired, the native corporation had an expectation of whatroyalties it would receive, and it would be inequitable for MMS to modifythat expectation for leases or portions of leases which MMS does not evenown.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> In the draft final rules accompanying the secondfurther notice of proposed rulemaking, MMS proposed to add a andSection;206.100(e) which provided that regulations, guidelines, and Notices toLessees in effect on the date that an Alaska Native Corporation acquireda proportionate interest in a lease will continue to apply to that interest.The MMS received several comments that this provision is unfair and notsupportable because the lease terms expressly recognize that regulationsmay change and that the lease will be subject to the new regulations. TheMMS agrees with the comments and has deleted this section from the finalrules. However, it should be clarified that these rules do not have anyretroactive effect. The MMS does not intend that any rules adopted in thisrulemaking would apply to production involving Alaska Native Corporationinterests which occurred prior to the effective date of this rulemaking.Section 206.101 Definitions.``Allowance''_Comments were received on this paragraph from State entities,Indian Tribes, and a Federal agency. One State commenter pointed out thatthis definition appears to be inconsistent with the sections of the valuationregulations dealing with transportation allowances (andSection;andSection;206.104 and 206.105). The word ``allowance'' is defined in terms of being``authorized,'' ``accepted'' or ``approved,'' whereas the regulations statethat a transportation ``allowance'' can be deducted without prior approval.Their concern is that the definition should match the usage in the regulations.An Indian commenter stated that the definition should ``clearly specifythat the transportation allowance applies only to transportation from <T3>the lease boundary</T3> to a point of sale remote from the lease andthat such costs be reasonable, actual, <T3>and necessary</T3>.'' A Federal agency comment stated that the definitionis too liberal and would result in the Federal Government subsidizing oilcompanies' operation costs. They cited an example where a transportationallowance of as much as 50 percent could be granted for moving oil in laterallines to off-lease measurement points; specifically, from wellheads toa Lease Automatic Custody Transfer (LACT) unit. One State commenter suggestedthat the definition is unnecessarily broad and recommended deleting thelanguage ``or an MMS-accepted or approved'' as well as deleting the phrase``to a point of sale or point of delivery remote from the lease.'' Thiscommenter also suggested adding the words ``necessary and'' before theword ``reasonable.'' The rationale for making these changes is that thereare other sections of the regulations that clarify ``that MMS need notprovide advance approval before a lessee could take an allowance.'' The``accepted or approved'' language could be interpreted to suggest that``allowances are not subject to later adjustments by MMS after full audit,based on arguments that the allowance was accepted by MMS after receiptof the actual costs report under andSection; 206.105(b)(2), or accepted underthe terms of the regulations.''<T3>MMS Response:</T3> These regulations, in effect, ``authorize'' thelessees to deduct certain costs incurred for transportation from the valuewithout prior approval. (See andSection;andSection; 206.104 and 206.105). Allowancescomputed by the lessee shall be ``accepted'' by MMS subject to review and/oraudit. The MMS has not included a definition of the phrase ``remote fromthe lease'' in the final rules. To eliminate any confusion, MMS has replacedthis phrase with the phrase ``off the lease.'' Thus, transportation offthe lease, other than gathering, is subject to an allowance. The MMS hasincluded an express statement in the final rule that transportation allowancesdo not apply to gathering costs. An industry group comment that the phrase``excluding gathering'' be deleted was rejected because MMS believes thatgathering is a cost of making oil marketable, which must be borne exclusivelyby the lessee.``Area''_A comment was received from industry addressing this definitionas being imprecise and in need of specified limits in order to define howlarge an ``area'' can be. In addition, the commenter proposed that thedefinition should be clarified by inserting the phrase ``or producing unit''after ``oil and/or gas field.''<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The definition seeks to encompass a concept thatis very difficult to describe. Narrowing its scope by describing it interms of size will only establish an arbitrary basis for the definition.To avoid this, MMS elected to retain the definition as proposed.``Arm's-length contract''_A large number of comments were received on thisdefinition from industry, Indians, a State/Tribal association, States,and a Federal agency. The proposed definition of ``arm's-length contract''generated a significant number of comments because it is, as one commenternoted, the ``* * * linchpin of the benchmark system * * *.'' Because ofthe importance of this concept, it is not surprising that several commentersdisagreed with the definition, either in part or in its entirety. Indeed,one State commenter described the reliance on the concept of ``arm's-length''as a method of determining value to be ``both inefficient and inappropriate''and suggested deleting the definition altogether. The majority of commenters,however, focused on what they considered to be flaws in the originallyproposed definition and the specific recommendations they considered necessaryto conclusively address those flaws.One Indian commenter suggested that the basic flaw in the definition isthe assumption that the interests of the lessee and the lessor are identical.This commenter pointed out that the courts ``have recognized that the interestsof lessees and lessors often diverge. See, e.g., <T3>Piney Woods Country Life School </T3>v. <T3>Shell Oil Company </T3>726 F.2d 225 (5th Cir. 1984), <T3>cert. denied</T3>., 105 S. Ct. 1868, (1985), <T3>Amoco Production Company </T3>v. <T3>Alexander</T3>, 622 S.W. 2d 563, (Tex. 1981).'' Another State commenterdescribed the definition as ``clearly deficient because it is limited toformal affiliation or common ownership interests between the contractingparties.'' The assumption that arm's-length contract prices reflect marketvalue ``ignores the fact that parties may have contractual or other relationshipsor understandings which would cause them to price oil below its value,especially if the benefit of the reduced royalty burden can be shared bymeans of the oil sales contract.'' This commenter believed that the lessee'sand lessor's interests may not be the same, and that the royalties duelessors is viewed by many lessees as a cost to be minimized, not maximized.Another comment submitted by the State/Tribal association cited the followingas an example of a situation where, although the parties are unaffiliated,the market value may be less than the arm's-length contract price: ``Thus,for example, the price received by a lessee/producer who is a captive shipperof a single purchaser pipeline, albeit unaffiliated, will be accepted asthe value, despite the fact that competing market forces are not operating.Even if audit revealed facts that would indicate that the sales price issuspect, the government would be bound under the proposed regulations toaccept it if the parties were nominally unaffiliated. The MMS proposalwould even foreclose the use of standard price checks, presently used ** * in * * * audit efforts, to assure that contract proceeds representthe statutory requirement of fair market value of production.'' One Statecommenter concluded that in its attempt to establish an ``almost purelyobjective'' test and provide for certainty in valuation, MMS has inadequatelytried to justify ``giving away the power to prevent manipulation of thepublic's royalties.'' Other State and Indian commenters claimed that theproposed definition, although it may be objective, remains ``unworkable''mainly because it does not include any reference to ``adverse economicinterests'' and ``free and open market'' nor would it serve as an effectiveaudit tool. They urge MMS to use the definition first proposed by MMS tothe RMAC because ``that definition incorporates the common legal understandingof the term arm's-length_the existence of unaffiliated willing buyers andwilling sellers of adverse economic interests operating in a free and openmarket_and is the only definition that can assure against valuation becomingan industry `honor system.' ''One State commenter stressed that even though the inclusion of additionalcriteria (``adverse economic interest'' and ``free and open market'') wouldincrease subjectivity, ``the appeals process is in place to provide protectionagainst arbitrary decisions.'' State and Indian commenters specificallyrecommended that the proposed definition be replaced by the one proposedto RMAC by MMS in the draft regulations. That definition reads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Arm's-length contract means a contract or agreement that has beenfreely arrived at in the open marketplace between independent, nonaffiliatedparties of adverse economic interests not involving any consideration otherthan the sale, processing, and/or transportation of lease products, andprudently negotiated under the facts and circumstances existing at thattime.</ITAG>One Indian Tribal commenter suggested that ``MMS should derive a definitionof oil value for royalty purposes (instead of what they consider wouldbe a necessary, all-inclusive, lengthy definition of arm's-length contract)which is simple and which represents the true value of the production.The [commenter] submits that such a definition must be based on the highestprice paid or posted for similar oil in the same field or area.'' Anothercommenter stressed that the definition limits the discretion of the Secretaryto select whatever method he/she considers appropriate to determine thevalue of oil for royalty purposes.A large number of industry commenters agreed that the definition of an``arm's-length contract'' as ``a contract or agreement between independentand nonaffiliated persons'' is sound and appropriate. However, these samecommenters (plus some Indian and State commenters) objected to the phrasein the proposed definition ``or if one person owns an interest (regardlessof how small), either directly or indirectly, in another person'' as beingtoo ``restrictive.'' \1\<NOTE/> The rationale for this position is that the phrase appearsto defeat MMS's intent to use arm'slength contracts as the principal valuationmethod. Many industry commenters addressed the need to clarify the definitionin order to insure that joint ventures, joint operating agreements, taxpartnerships, and other relationships where the ``interest'' of one partyin another is not one of beneficial control, are specifically excluded.As one of these commenters put it: ``Similarly, involvement in one or morejoint operations with a competitor should not be viewed as materially affectingthe arm's-length nature of transactions between the firms. However, thereference to joint venture in the definition of person, which is referencedin the proposed definition of arm's-length contract, could be improperlyconstrued as including normal joint oil field operations conducted underthe terms of joint operating or similar agreements. Joint operations clearlyinvolve no interlocking ownership of the instruments of voting securitiesas between the firms. Joint operations are undertaken to accomplish effectivereservoir management, to satisfy spacing requirements, or to share theenormous costs involved in certain OCS and frontier areas. Such joint operationsare often mandated and/or approved and sanctioned by the various governmentalagencies having jurisdiction and supervision over the operations (i.e.,communitization, unitization, and development plans; and joint biddingagreements). They do not establish joint marketing rights, or otherwiseerode the competitive desire of each owner to achieve maximum value forits share of production.'' Several industry commenters also complainedthat the ownership by one party of one share of stock in another partywould confer affiliated or non-arm's-length status to virtually all otherwisearm's-length transactions between the two parties. They further statedthat this would be true even if the pension plan of one party holds oneshare of stock in the other party. One Indian commenter suggested thatMMS would waste its efforts trying to determine ownership interest: ``Thereis also a problem with using ownership interest `regardless of how small'in the definition. There is no definition in the proposed regulations of`owns an interest.' Would the ownership of one share of stock be consideredowning an interest? Parameters must be set and adhered to. When MMS startstrying to determine ownership interests no matter how small, an endlessquagmire will develop, and time and resources will be devoted to this determinationwhen they would be better spent on MMS's other duties.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Several commenters used the word ``restrictive'' to meanthat the language in the proposed definition regarding ``if one personowns an interest (regardless of how small), either directly or indirectly,in another person'' significantly restricts the number of situations wherean arm's-length contract would actually exist. A few comments espousedthis same position, yet they termed the definition as too ``broad.'' Asused in this discussion, MMS considers the word ``restrictive'' to representthe above-mentioned position, and the word ``broad'' to denote that thelanguage of the definition is either too vague or not restrictive enough.Another industry commenter pointed out that the proposed definition isinconsistent with the guidelines concerning beneficial control under generallyaccepted accounting principles, while a number of other industry commentersclaimed that it eliminates certainty in valuation.The majority of all the comments stress the need to replace the phrase``or if one person owns an interest (regardless of how small), either directlyor indirectly, in another person'' with a statement that specifies quantifiablelimits that would be used to determine whether or not one party would beconsidered to have a controlling interest in another party. Nearly allof these comments recommended that MMS adopt the following language forthe definition of control which has already been implemented by BLM ascodified at 43 CFR 3400.0-5(rr)(3) (51 FR 43910, December 5, 1986):Controlled by or under common control with, based on the instruments ofownership of the voting securities of an entity, means:(i) Ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutes control;(ii) Ownership of 20 through 50 percent creates a presumption of control;and (iii) Ownership of less than 20 percent creates a presumption of noncontrol.A few industry commenters recommended replacing the word ``person'' withthe word ``party'' in the definition of arm's-length contract because theyforesee that the use of the word ``person'' will ``unnecessarily precludecontracts between joint ventures from qualifying as arm's-length.'' Similarly,one industry commenter suggested deleting the words ``consortium'' and``joint venture'' from the definition for ``person'' (``party'') for thesame reason.Finally, one industry commenter objected to ``the implicit and explicitpresumption throughout the Oil Proposal that proceeds actually receivedthrough affiliated sales are less than fair value. This presumption placesan unfair, impractical, and impossible standard on a producer who, actingin its best economic interest, elects to sell to an affiliated entity.In this regard, a redefinition of the term ``Arm's-Length Contract'' isrecommended to eliminate reference to and inclusion of de minimis relationships.''Based on the numerous comments concerning the originally proposed definition,MMS included in the first draft final rule a definition which adopted the``control'' language found in the BLM's regulations at 43 CFR 3400.0-5(rr)(3).In response to those commenters who believed that parties to an arm's-lengthcontract must have adverse economic interests, MMS included in the firstdraft final rule definition a provision which requires that to be arm's-lengtha contract must reflect the total consideration actually transferred fromthe buyer to the seller, either directly or indirectly. For example, ifthe parties to the contract agreed that the price for oil from a Federalor Indian lease will be reduced in exchange for a bonus price to be paidfor other production from a fee lease, MMS would not treat that contractas arm's-length. Many of the comments on the first draft final rule again focused on thedefinition of arm's-length contract. Most of the industry commenters believedthat the reference to ``reflects the total consideration actually transferreddirectly or indirectly from the buyer to the seller'' did not belong inthe definition of arm's-length contract. Rather, they stated that it properlyshould be dealt with as a ``gross proceeds'' issue. The States and Indianscommented that a reference to adverse economic interests still was necessary.They also believed that there must be a requirement of a free and openmarket. Finally, the States and Indians thought that MMS should lower thecontrol threshold to 10 percent and that MMS should have more flexibilityto rebut presumptions of noncontrol. Many of these commenters also thoughtthat the rules should state that the lessee has the burden of demonstratingthat its contract is arm's-length. The comments on the second draft final rule were similar to those alreadyreceived. Many commenters raised questions about possible audit difficulties.The American Petroleum Institute supported the definition in the seconddraft final rule.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS adopted many of the changes suggested forthe originally proposed definition. The MMS agrees that the ``total consideration''issue is properly a gross proceeds matter that does not reflect the affiliationof the parties. Thus, that phrase has been deleted from the arm's-lengthcontract definition and the matter dealt with under the definition of ``grossproceeds''. The MMS did not adopt the concept of ``free and open market''because that concept is highly subjective. However, MMS did include a requirementthat the contract be arrived at ``in the marketplace'' in support of theconcept that an arm's-length contract must be between nonaffiliated persons.Also, in furtherance of that concept, MMS included a provision that anarm's-length contract must be between persons with opposing economic interestsregarding that contract which means that the parties are acting in theireconomic self-interest. Thus, although the parties may have common interestselsewhere, their interests must be opposing with respect to the contractin issue. In response to many comments on the second draft final rule,MMS has reduced the control threshold to 10 percent. The MMS can rebutpresumptions of noncontrol between 0 and 10 percent and lessees can rebutpresumptions of control between 10 and 50 percent.Many commenters thought that MMS's inclusion of joint venture in the definitionof ``person'' improperly narrowed the definition of arm's-length contract.These commenters have misconstrued MMS's intent. The definition of ``person''includes joint ventures because there are instances where joint venturesare established as separate entities. In those situations, if a party witha controlling interest in the joint venture buys production from the jointventure entity, that contract is non-arm's-length. However, MMS is awarethat it also is common for companies to jointly contribute resources todevelop a lease and then share the production proportionately. In a situationwhere four totally unaffiliated companies share the production, if oneof the companies buys all of the production from the other three, thosethree contracts would be considered arm's-length. The company's purchasefrom its affiliate of course would be non-arm's-length. The MMS also has included in the arm's-length definition a provision wherebyif one person has less than a 10-percent interest in another person whichcreates a presumption of noncontrol, MMS can rebut that presumption ifit demonstrates actual or legal control, including the existence of interlockingdirectorates. For example, there may be situations where ownership of 5percent of a very large corporation could give a person sufficient controlto direct the activities of that corporation. Where there is evidence ofactual control, MMS can rebut the presumption of noncontrol.Finally, in response to those commenters who believed that the lessee hasthe burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length, MMS hasincluded such a provision in the valuation sections, discussed below. TheMMS also believes that these sections satisfy the request that the rulesprescribe that the lessee has the burden of proving nonaffiliation becauseone of the requirements for demonstrating that a contract is an arm's-lengthcontract is to demonstrate the degree of affiliation between the contractingparties.The MMS may require a lessee to certify ownership in certain situations.Documents that controllers or financial accounting departments of individualcompanies file with the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning significantchanges in ownership (e.g., 5 percent) must be made available to MMS uponrequest.The final rule also provides that, to be considered arm's-length for anyspecific production month, a contract must meet the definition's requirementsfor that production month as well as when the contract was executed. Someindustry commenters objected to this provision stating that, if the contractwas arm's-length when executed, it should satisfy MMS.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> When the parties to a contract no longer have opposingeconomic interests, the reliability of that contract as an accurate indicatorof value becomes suspect. In such circumstances, MMS will not rely on acontract price to conclusively establish value.The MMS asked for comments on whether the term ``relatives'' needed furtherdefinition. Many useful comments were received. The MMS has decided, however,that further explanation of the meaning of relatives is better suited toguidelines which will be prepared after these rules are adopted.*``Audit''_Only a few comments were received on this proposed definition.All the comments focused on the portion of the definition which followedthe first sentence. Generally, these comments suggested that the proposeddefinition limited the scope of MMS's authority, particularly with regardto Indian leases.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> It is MMS's intention that the definition not belimited. Therefore, the final rule deletes everything following the firstsentence of the proposed definition because the succeeding sentences wereonly intended to be explanatory.``Condensate''_One industry comment advocated adding the phrase ``beyondnormal lease separation procedures'' after the word ``processing'' in thefirst sentence of the definition in order to clarify that ``liquid hydrocarbonsresulting from normal lease separation procedures are condensate'' whereas``processing,'' in this context, refers to more sophisticated facilitiesthat are generally located off lease.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> This definition has been retained intact in thefinal rule. However, a definition of the word ``processing'' has been addedfor clarification purposes at andSection; 206.101. ``Contract''_A comment from a State commenter recognized that ``as a matterof law, oral contracts are enforceable.'' This commenter recommends thatthe words ``oral or'' be deleted because they argue that ``there is noway that the terms of such contracts can be adequately verified to assurethat all of the consideration and benefits under it have been honestlydetailed by the lessee under proposed andSection; 207.4. Thus, the government,in a situation involving an oral contract, must assure itself that it hasall of the information relevant to the transaction; reliance on the `contract'document_drafted by one party only_would be insufficient.''<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS has retained this definition as proposedbecause, in accordance with andSection; 207.4, oral contracts negotiatedby the lessee must be placed in written form and retained by the lessee.If the MMS believes that the written documentation is not a truthful representationof the actual terms of the sales agreements, the lessee may be liable forpenalties for submitting false, inaccurate, or misleading data.``Gathering''_MMS included in the draft final rule a definition of gatheringas the movement of lease production to a central accumulation or treatmentpoint on the lease, unit, or communitized area, or to a central accumulationor treatment point off the lease, unit, or communitized area (if authorizedby the BLM or MMS operations authority). In most instances, gathering isa cost of production or marketing for which MMS will not grant any deduction.The MMS received numerous comments from industry concerning the phrase``or to a central accumulation or treatment point off the lease, unit orcommunitized area as approved by BLM or MMS OCS operations personnel foronshore and OCS leases, respectively.'' These commenters stated that thephrase was unclear and that it should be removed from the definition. Severalindustry commenters recommended limiting gathering to the lease or unitarea so a transportation allowance may be obtained for all offlease movement.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The definition has been retained intact. The operationalregulations of both BLM and MMS require that a lessee place all productionin a marketable condition, if economically feasible, and that a lesseeproperly measure all production in a manner acceptable to the authorizedofficials of those agencies. Unless specifically approved otherwise, therequirements of the regulations must be met prior to the production leavingthe lease. Therefore, when approval has been granted for the removal ofproduction from a lease, unit, or communitized area for the purpose oftreating the production or accumulating production for delivery to a purchaserprior to the requirements of the operational regulations having been met,MMS does not believe that any allowances should be granted for costs incurredby a lessee in these instances. ``Gross Proceeds''_MMS received many comments on the definition of ``grossproceeds'' from industry, States, Indian Tribes, and a State/tribal association.One State agreed with the language of the proposed definition and supportedits endorsement as follows: ``Such a definition must be all inclusive.Any exceptions would only serve as precedents for carving more exceptions,and invite creative accounting mechanisms aimed at escaping royalty obligations.''One Indian commenter recommended replacing the word ``entitled'' with thephrase ``accrued or accruing to'' while another State commenter supportedretaining the word ``entitled'' because it confirms the lessee's ``obligationto act in the best interests of the lessor.'' This same commenter, however,pointed out: ``In the Purpose and Background statement, MMS states thatit is the intent of the regulations to include as royalty all of the benefitsaccruing, or that could accrue, to the lessee. However, the actual definitionof gross proceeds does not encompass all potential benefits. For example,a lessee may accept a lower price for its production from a Federal leasefor the opportunity to sell to the particular purchaser its productionfrom other leases. Despite the difficulties of attributing a value to suchan opportunity, it is a benefit accruing to the lessee under its salescontract. The language of the definition, however, suggests that `grossproceeds' only encompasses consideration that has been stated in dollarterms. Thus, it technically does not include all of the benefits that couldaccrue under a sales contract.''A majority of those commenters that objected to the proposed definitionexpressed the same basic arguments in support of their position. Severalindustry commenters argued that the proposed definition contains languagewhich is too expansive, claiming that the word ``entitled'' injects uncertaintyand subjectivity into valuation. In addition, this term is considered objectionableby some because, as one commenter stated, ``the intent of `entitled' isnot clearly understood, nor is it a clearly defined legal term. Lesseescannot know how either they or MMS auditors will, or should, apply the`entitled' concept.'' They recommend deleting this term and abandoningthe underlying concept altogether.A few industry commenters suggested that the proposed definition does notconform to the terms of Federal and Indian oil and gas leases nor the statutesunder which they were issued. They argue that the present definition ``attemptsto collect royalty on consideration received by the lessee [for] otherthan production saved, removed, or sold from the lease'' and that it seeksto redefine ``value'' to include income or credits which are unrelatedto such production. Other industry commenters agreed with this overall approach, especiallyas it relates to reimbursements for ``production costs'' and ``post-productioncosts.'' One commenter addressed this point at length: ``This definitionmust be changed to limit the royalty to the value of the production atthe lease. The current expansive definition allows MMS to reach far beyondthat value to confiscate the value added by post-production activities.The MMS has misread the <T3>The California Co. v. Udall</T3> decision to require the lessee todo much more than place production in a marketable condition. If productioncould be sold at a lease but the lessee determines to enhance the valueby retaining control and further processing it, the value added or reimbursementsfor the costs of such further handling are not appropriate for considerationin the value of the product for royalty purposes.''Many of the industry commenters objected to the ``laundry list'' of servicesthey asserted are unrelated to production being included as part of ``grossproceeds.'' One industry commenter urged MMS to adopt language which wouldspecifically allow a variety of costs to be deducted from gross proceedsin order to arrive at the value of production.A few industry commenters concluded that the definition, in its presentform, is inconsistent with industry practice and not responsive to the``interaction of market forces.''One industry commenter noted that ``some of the items specifically identifiedas subject to royalty under the gross proceeds concept are the subjectof ongoing litigation and the MMS should not preempt judicial decisionthrough regulation.''One State commenter asserted that the definition is only necessary as adeterminant of minimum value and, in this sense, should be as expansiveas possible. This commenter suggested that ``the words `but is not limitedto' need to be added after the words `gross proceeds, as applied to oilalso includes.' '' This language was thought to be needed because thereis ``no reason to restrict the term gross proceeds to encompass only thoseitems listed.'' Furthermore, this commenter is concerned that the presentlanguage will ``restrict the Secretary's authority to react if differenttypes of sales arrangements arise in the future.''Another industry commenter asserted that there are ``serious ambiguitiesand inconsistencies'' in the definition of gross proceeds ``as relatedto transportation deductions imposed by oil purchasers. These ambiguitiesand inconsistencies could be interpreted to preclude the use of a market-basedvalue for royalty oil where oil purchasers in the area deduct actual transportationcosts from their posted prices.''A large number of industry commenters recommended that MMS adopt the definitionproposed by the RMAC Oil Valuation Panel which reads as follows: ``Grossproceeds (for royalty payment purposes) means the consideration accruedto the lessee for production removed or sold from a Federal, Tribal, orIndian allotted lease.''Many of the comments on the second draft final rule addressed the grossproceeds definition, particularly industry comments. These comments againgenerally stated that the definition is too expansive.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> In the draft final rule, MMS included a definitionwhich was modified slightly from the original proposal. In the second draftfinal rule, MMS again made a modification discussed below, which has beenretained in the final rule. The MMS retained the intent of the proposedlanguage because gross proceeds to which a lessee is ``entitled'' meansthose prices and/or benefits to which it is legally entitled under theterms of the contract. If a lessee fails to take proper or timely actionto receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled under the contract,it must pay royalty at a value based upon that legally obtainable priceor benefit, unless the contract is amended or revised. As is discussedmore fully below, gross proceeds under arm's-length contracts are a principaldeterminant of value. MMS cannot adopt that standard and then not requirelessees to pay royalties in accordance with the express terms of thosecontracts. (See andSection; 206.102(j).) It is MMS's intent that the definitionbe expansive to include all consideration flowing from the buyer to theseller for the oil, whether that consideration is in the form of moneyor any other form of value.Lessees cannot avoid their royalty obligations by keeping a part of theiragreement outside the four corners of the contract. Moreover, as notedearlier, many commenters stated that the ``total consideration'' conceptproperly belonged as part of gross proceeds, not in the definition of arm's-lengthcontract. Therefore, MMS purposefully has drafted the gross proceeds definitionto be expansive and thus include all types of consideration flowing fromthe buyer to the seller. Toward that end, MMS has replaced the word ``paid''used in the first draft final rule with the term ``accruing.'' There maybe certain types of consideration which are not actually paid by the buyerto the seller, but from which the seller benefits. The term ``accruing''ensures that all such consideration is considered gross proceeds.The so-called ``laundry list'' of services are all benefits that a lesseemay be legally entitled to under the terms of the contract and are consideredpart of the value for the production from the lease. Costs of productionand placing production in marketable condition are considered servicesthat the lessee is obligated to perform at no cost to the Federal Governmentor Indian lessor.``Indian Tribe''_MMS has corrected the typographical error in the proposeddefinition and has replaced the word ``state'' with the words ``UnitedStates.''``Lease''_One Indian commenter focused on the following issue: ``Inclusionof any contract, profit-sharing arrangement, joint venture, or other agreementin the term `lease' as opposed to a more standardized Bureau of IndianAffairs (BIA) form lease may cause confusion. Most joint ventures and profit-sharingarrangements contain explicit provisions on payment of expenses and divisionof revenues.'' <T3>MMS Response: </T3>Contracts, profit-sharing arrangements, and jointventures are all examples of types of valid leases already in existence.All specify royalty provisions, some more detailed than others. Nonetheless,they all qualify under the definition of ``lease.'' Therefore, MMS hasretained the proposed definition in the final rule.``Lessee''_The proposed definition of ``lessee'' generated comments fromthe industry and from States. By far the most significant issue raisedis that the proposed definition is inconsistent with the statutory definitionof ``lessee'' found in the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of1982 (FOGRMA). The originally proposed definition uses the phrase ``orany person who has <T3>assumed</T3> an obligation'' whereas the language in FOGRMA uses theword ``<T3>assigned</T3>'' in place of the word ``assumed.'' The commenters arguedthat MMS's use of the word ``assumed'' expands the definition beyond theintent of Congress and ``seeks to invalidate the lease provisions withrespect to royalty payment * * *'' They further asserted that there isno reason to redefine the term and recommended using the definition foundin FOGRMA at section 3(7), 30 U.S.C. 1702(7). Two industry commenters suggested that the definition be narrowed to ``excludepersons who have assumed an obligation to make royalty and other paymentsrequired by the lease.'' Their argument focused on the difference in responsibilitiesbetween lessees and payors: ``The payor is not necessarily a lessee andshould not be defined as one. A lessee is bound by the terms of a leaseagreement while a payor is not.'' Two industry commenters suggested that the definition as provided in FOGRMAshould be revised for the purposes of these regulations for the sake ofclarity.A State commenter objected to the proposed definition because it has theeffect of spreading ``the reporting and payment responsibility among numerousparties. With each of these parties reporting and paying separately, nosingle party has the responsibility to insure that 100 percent of all productionis reported and 100 percent of the royalties are paid.'' <T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS agrees with the comments regarding consistencywith the definition found in FOGRMA and, therefore, has replaced the word``assumed'' with the word ``assigned.'' The term ``assigned,'' as usedin this part, is restricted to the assignment of an obligation to makeroyalty or other payments required by the lease. It is in no way relatedto lease ``assignments'' approved through the MMS, BLM, or BIA. It is MMS'sintent that operators and others who pay royalties follow these regulationsin determining the royalties due. The lessee of record is ultimately responsibleif the operator or payor does not properly pay the royalties due the lessor.``Like-quality lease products''_Several Indian commenters stated that thedefinition should not include any reference to legal characteristics. Theconcern of many of these commenters was that this criterion could resultin State-imposed limitations on royalty values. <T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS disagrees that reference to legal characteristicsshould be deleted. The term like-quality is used in the rules for comparabilitypurposes. If oil is regulated, only oil in the same regulated categoryshould be considered in a comparability analysis.``Load Oil''_One industry commenter suggested that the word ``fuel'' beadded as noted in the following proposed language: `` <T3>Load oil</T3> means any oil which has been used with respect to theoperation of oil or gas wells for <T3>fuel</T3>, stimulation, workover, chemical treatment, production orsuch other purposes as the operator may elect.''A State commenter recommended deleting the phrase ``as the operator mayelect'' from the definition because: ``There is no reason to institutionalize,in an enforceable regulatory form, a standard of lessee discretion.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>Load oil is distinguished by MMS as oil used forthe purposes of stimulating production through injection into the wellbore.Using oil for the purposes of enhancing the value of, or otherwise treating,lease production at the surface is not considered ``load oil.'' Thus, oilused as fuel is not load oil. Also, in order to eliminate confusion, MMShas deleted the phrase ``or such other purposes as the operator may elect.''``Marketable condition''_Only a few persons commented on this definition.A State commenter addressed the following concerns: ``The definition statesthat product will be deemed marketable if it is `in a condition that willbe accepted by a purchaser under a sales contract typical for the fieldor area.' Such contracts, now or in the future, may provide that the purchaserbear the costs of the treatment necessary to place products in a marketablecondition. Under the definition, as written, therefore, there would bea theoretical market for untreated product, and MMS would lose the benefitof the increased value attributable to requiring the lessee to performthe necessary conditioning.``An additional problem exists because of the difficulty of determiningwhat is `typical' for the field or area. This is because of the same informationaldifficulties that disable MMS from adequately applying the majority portionanalysis. Without full access to the range of sales arrangements that mayexist for production in a given area, MMS will be forced to rely on lessee-selecteddocumentation in order to determine what type of conditioning is 'typical'for the area.'' Two industry commenters stated that the definition is too subjective andprovides no guidance to the lessee. <T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS believes it is highly unlikely that theoil industry would change the quality requirements for oil sales to avoidpaying royalties on nonrecoverable marketing costs. If such an arrangementoccurred, MMS would then need to determine if the arrangement is an attemptto avoid paying royalties on the market value of the oil, or a contractto not only purchase the oil, but to place it in marketable condition aswell. In either case, the costs for placing the product in marketable conditionwould not be an allowable deduction from the value for royalty purposes.(See andSection; 206.102(i).) ``Marketing Affiliate''_MMS received several comments that sales to marketingaffiliates who then resell the oil to third persons should not be treatedunder the rules as non-arm's-length sales. MMS has addressed this issuein the valuation rules discussed below, and is including a definition ofmarketing affiliate as an affiliate of the lessee whose function is toacquire only the lessee's production and to market that production. Someindustry commenters stated that the term ``only'' should be deleted toinclude affiliates that purchase oil from other sources including othersellers in the same field. <T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS is retaining the term only. If the affiliateof the lessee also purchases oil from other sources, then that affiliate'sposted price or oil sales contract prices could be used in determiningvalue if they satisfy the first benchmark. Also, deleting the term ``only''from the definition may require the lessee to track production much fartherdownstream than the point at which it can be valued under the benchmarks.``Net-back method''_Two State commenters objected to the proposed definitionand industry commenters recommended adding clarifying language. The followingdiscussion outlines the position of the two State commenters that foundthe proposed definition objectionable: ``Briefly, our objections are twofold:1. Net-back is a useful method to independently cross-check lessee declaredvalues, and thus its use should not be restricted to those situations inwhich the `first' sale, transfer, or use is downstream from the lease.``Second, net-back should be allowed from any reasonable point at whicha value can be ascribed to the product. There is no guarantee that the`initial sales point' or `first alternate point' will exhibit the openmarket conditions essential for attribution of a true value for the products.``We therefore propose the following alternate definition: Net-back methodmeans a procedure for valuing or verifying prices assigned to lease productsor for independent cross checking of the validity of the gross proceedsof lease products or of prices posted or paid in a field or area. The procedureinvolves calculating back from any downstream point at which values forsuch products reasonably and fairly can be derived. In applying the net-back,consideration will be given to the reasonable costs of processing and transportationfrom the producing lease, unit or communitized area to arrive at a valuefor the products at the lease.''The industry commenter recommended that the following language be addedto the proposed definition: ``In net back calculation the alternate pointused for value determination shall be the point which is the closest pointto the lease at which a price for similar lease products can be establishedby alternate means. Such alternate means may include posted prices or publishedspot market prices.'' <T3>MMS Response:</T3> Upon review, MMS determined that the originallyproposed definition of net-back was too broad_it applied to any situationwhere lease production is sold at a point off the lease. MMS's intent isthat a net-back method be used for valuation primarily where the form ofthe lease product has changed, and it is necessary to start with the salesprices of the changed product and deduct transportation and processingcosts. An example would be where oil production from a Federal lease isused-on lease to generate electricity which is then sold. If the valueof the oil cannot be determined through application of the first four benchmarksin the regulations (see andSection; 206.102(c)), then a net-back method wouldinvolve beginning with the sale price of the electricity and then deductingthe costs of generation and transportation, thus working back to a valueat the lease. In the draft final rule, MMS used the phrase ``ultimate proceeds''to try and refer to the downstream product. Many commenters thought theterm would result in MMS doing a net-back from the farthest downstreamproduct, even to the point of ``Stainmaster Carpet'' or ``model airplanes.''This was not MMS's intent. Therefore, the term ``ultimate'' was deletedand a reference included to starting the net-back at the first point atwhich reasonable values for any product may be determined by a sale pursuantto an arm's-length contract or by comparison to other sales of such products.Thus, if there are five different stages of chemical or fiber productsbetween oil production and ``Stainmaster Carpet,'' if the value of thesecond product can be determined through comparison with sales of othersuch products in the same market, MMS would begin the net-back from thatproduct, not from the sale price of the carpet.``Person''_One Indian commenter supported the inclusion of ``joint venture''in the definition of ``person'' while two industry commenters recommendedthat ``joint venture'' be deleted. The rationale these two commenters relyon as the basis for recommending deletion is that the term ``person'' isused in the definition of ``arm's-length contract'' and if ``that definitionis not altered as suggested herein, then inclusion of a joint venture inthe definition of person will further narrow the definition of arm's-lengthtransaction by clouding the issue of control and the application of thedefinition [of] arm's-length to other joint venturer transactions.'' Anotherindustry commenter advocated replacing the word ``firm'' with the word``company'' because they believe that, in this context, it would be moreappropriate. Another industry commenter recommended adding the phrase ``whenestablished as a separate entity'' after the term joint venture.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS has adopted the addition of the suggestedphrase concerning joint ventures in the final definition. The MMS agreesthat two unaffiliated parties jointly developing and producing a leaseshould not be viewed as one entity unless those parties have formally establisheda separate entity that involves them both.``Posted price''_The proposed definition received only a few comments,two of which recommended expanding the definition of posted price to includethe phrase ``or at the specific onshore or offshore terminal(s) listedin the announcement'' after the words ``in the field.'' These industrycommenters stated that there are ``currently very few `field postings,'rather there are terminal postings'' and that expansion of the definitionas noted above would avoid confusion in applying the definition.Another industry commenter believed that the word ``posted'' is outdatedand that some purchasers may not publish a price bulletin, instead providingprice quotations or notices to any seller desiring to do business withthe purchaser.A State commenter recommended deleting the phrase ``net of all deductions''for the following reasons: ``The `net of all deductions' language shouldbe deleted. MMS has proposed a system of allowances, which as a practicalmatter makes the `net of deduction' language unnecessary for the purposesof defining `posted price.' This proposal could be interpreted to institutionalizethe allowances without a mechanism of independent cross-check by MMS.``Common industry deductions are for transportation and conditioning. Yetthere are no restrictions upon what a poster can include as a deductionfrom the posted price. Thus MMS must retain the power to scrutinize suchmatters, and add such deductions back into the value of the productionwhen necessary.''This same commenter believed that the definition is too restrictive: ``Wealso object to restricting the definition of posted price to formal pricebulletins. Rather, the definition should be broader and include both pricesposted and those regularly paid. It is not unusual for a buyer to comeinto the market and offer publicly a price for crude, which is like a postingbut not necessarily a price bulletin. Such publicly announced offers tobuy could be at a price higher than offered in a price bulletin, and areno less `market determined' than supposedly are postings in bulletins.Price bulletins are, generally, only circulated by the major companiesand thus reliance on them may give undue advantage to the ability of thosecompanies to establish prices.'' A State commenter also recommended deletingthe phrase ``and location for oil in marketable condition'' stating thatthis provision authorizes lessees to, in effect, deduct transportationcosts without any review by MMS.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS is expanding the definition in the finalrule to include references to onshore and offshore ``terminal postings''and ``price notices.'' For clarification purposes, the word ``condition''replaces the word ``quality'' which follows the word ``marketable'' inthe first sentence. The phrase ``net of all adjustments'' has been revisedto read ``net of all adjustments to.'' As used in this definition, theterm ``adjustments'' refers to deductions from the price of oil for qualityadjustments such as API gravity and sulfur content. Adjustments for locationalso may be taken into account where appropriate. It would be unfair notto take into account price reductions which reflect location.``Processing''_MMS has added a definition of ``processing'' as any processdesigned to remove elements or compounds (hydrocarbon and nonhydrocarbon)from gas, including absorption, adsorption, or refrigeration. Field processessuch as natural pressure reduction, mechanical separation, heating, cooling,dehydration, and compression are not considered processing. Under thisdefinition, the changing of pressures and/or temperatures in a reservoiris not considered processing.Section 206.102 Valuation standards.Section 206.102(a) sets the basic standard that the value for royalty purposeswill be the value of the oil determined pursuant to this section less applicableallowances. One State commenter recommended that the phrase ``less applicabletransportation allowances'' be deleted because it is unnecessary, confusing,and because it implies that the lessee can deduct the transportation allowancefrom the value received and report the resultant reduced value as a singleline item.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The regulation as adopted refers to ``applicable''allowances, which includes transportation allowances. It does not implythat any and all costs can be deducted. Also, it refers to ``this Subpart''which includes andSection; 206.105. That section provides complete detailsregarding transportation allowances. Therefore, this suggestion was notadopted.Two Indian commenters recommended that the paragraph be modified by (1)deleting any reference to the transportation allowances because they areimproper for Indian leases, and (2) adding the phrase ``in marketable condition.''<T3>MMS Response:</T3> Transportation allowances are allowable under mostIndian leases. It has been MMS's practice to grant such allowances. Ifan Indian lease restricts such allowances, then the lease terms will govern.The MMS does not agree that the phrase ``in marketable condition'' shouldbe inserted prior to the word ``determined.'' Section 206.102(i) requiresthat oil be placed in marketable condition at no cost to the lessor. Thus,because andSection; 206.102(a) provides that value be ``determined pursuantto this section,'' the marketability requirement already is included. The MMS is including in the final rule a new paragraph (a)(2) which statesthat for any Indian leases which provide that the Secretary may considerthe highest price paid or offered for a major portion of production (majorportion) in determining value for royalty purposes, MMS will, where dataare available and where it is practicable, compare the value determinedin accordance with the prescribed standards with the major portion. Therule provides that the value for royalty purposes will be based upon thehigher of those two values. The draft final rule included a provision that,if MMS determined that the major portion results in an unreasonably highvalue, then it would not be used for royalty purposes. Many Indian commentersthought that, for their leases which include a specific reference to themajor portion, value should establish a minimum value, and a major portionvalue in most instances will be reasonable because at least half the oilis sold at or above that price. MMS agrees and has made the change to thefinal rule. Many Indian commenters raised concerns about the qualifications includedin this paragraph. These commenters must recognize that, if data are notavailable, it is impossible to do a major portion analysis.The MMS is also including in paragraph (a)(2) a description of how themajor portion is computed. It will be determined using like-quality oilsold under arm's-length contracts because non-arm's-length contracts maynot reflect market value. The production will be arrayed from highest priceto lowest price (at the bottom). The major portion is that price at which50 percent (by volume) plus one barrel of the oil (starting from the bottomup) is sold. An industry commenter recommended deletion of the referenceto ``area''. However, because only arm's-length contracts are used in theanalysis, the field may not yield a sufficiently reasonable sample in allcases. Generally, it will not be necessary to look beyond the field.The MMS believes that, for these Indian leases, by comparing the majorportion to values determined using arm's-length contract prices or thebenchmarks for non-arm's-length contracts, and using the higher of thetwo, the Indians will be receiving royalties in accordance with their contractwith the lessee.One industry commenter was critical of the major portion analysis claimingthat it could yield eratic results in some circumstances. An Indian commentersuggested that MMS use the Conservation Division Manual procedure for computingmajor portion which was claimed to be different from what was includedin the rules.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The major portion analysis has been a part of valuationprocedures for at least 45 years. The MMS considers it to be a workableprocedure. The MMS maintains that the procedure contained in the finalrules is consistent with the Conservation Division Manual (which no longeris in effect).Section 206.102(b) provides the valuation procedure for valuing oil soldpursuant to arm's-length contracts. Many comments were received regardingthe concept of valuing oil on the basis of gross proceeds received underan arm's-length contract. They were about equally divided in number asto those in favor and those opposed.Several State and Indian commenters, and one State/Indian association disagreedwith the concept of valuing oil on the basis of gross proceeds receivedunder an arm's-length contract. The commenters contend that, historically,gross proceeds has been regarded as a minimum value and that it has longbeen recognized that a market value clause in a lease ``is distinctly andsubstantially different from a gross proceeds clause.'' They were concernedthat the concept establishes an industry honor system. Also, concern wasexpressed that the proposed regulations be consistent with the provisionsof the Indian lease agreement, and they questioned whether the proposedregulation permits the Secretary to discharge his/her responsibilitiesto the Indian lessors. These commenters maintained that whether an arm's-lengthtransaction yields market value depends upon the definition of arm's-lengthcontract. Two State and two Indian commenters expressed concern that the proposedregulations will institutionalize an industry ``honor system'' for valuationof Federal royalty production. The commenters stated that the rules provideno mechanism for independent oversight and cross-check of lessee declarationsof value and impose such impossible information burdens on government thatthey can only result in total reliance on lessee-generated information.They stated further that whether an arm's-length transaction yields marketvalue depends upon the definition of ``arm's-length'' and whether independentprice checks confirm the receipt of proceeds.The commenters pointed out that many sales arrangements may appear to bearm's-length on the surface, but in actuality the producers are ``captiveshippers'' subject to forced sale and the purchaser's take-it-or-leave-itprice. This scenario is stated to be contrary to the common legal understandingof an arm's-length market-determined price. The commenters noted that MMS'sdefinition of ``arm's-length'' does not even contain the minimum acceptablerequirements, in a legal sense, necessary to assure that such contractsare, in fact, arm's-length. They argue that the use of an arm's-length/grossproceeds valuation method requires that such matters as open-market conditionsand the relationships between parties, beyond mere affiliation, be investigated.Also, the commenters stated that MMS does not confine arm's-length to thosecontracts that involve only the consideration for the sale of lease products.Coupled with the proposed definition of gross proceeds, the commentersbelieve ``this allows lessees the opportunity to manipulate the pricesreceived for their production from a Federal lease by accepting a lowerprice in order to sell production from other non-Federal leases, possiblyat a more profitable price.''<T3>MMS Response:</T3> In response to a large number of comments from theStates, Indians, and industry, MMS has modified the regulations which governthe valuation of oil production sold pursuant to arm's-length contracts.For almost all such sales, the value for royalty purposes will continueto be the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee. Under MMS's existing regulations,the lessee's gross proceeds pursuant to an arm's-length contract are acceptable,though not conclusively, as the value for royalty purposes. The MMS believesthat the gross proceeds standard should be applied to arm's-length salesfor several reasons. MMS typically accepts this value because it is wellgrounded in the realities of the marketplace where, in most cases, the7/8ths or 5/6ths owner will be striving to obtain the highest attainableprice for the oil production for the benefit of itself; the royalty ownerbenefits from this incentive. It also adds more certainty to the valuationprocess for payors and provides them with a clear and equitable value onwhich to base royalties. Under the final regulations, in most instancesthe lessee will not need to be concerned that several years after the productionhas been sold MMS will establish royalty value in excess of the arm's-lengthcontract proceeds, thereby imposing a potential hardship on the lessee.Establishing gross proceeds under an arm's-length contract as the royaltyvalue also has benefits for MMS and those States which assist MMS in theaudit and enforcement effort. The gross proceeds standard will give auditorsan objective basis for measuring lessee compliance. It will reduce auditworkload and reduce the administrative appeal burden which results whenvaluation standards are too subjective, particularly when values are determinedto be in excess of a lessee's arm's-length contract gross proceeds.MMS recognizes, however, that there must be exceptions to the general rulethat the lessee's arm's-length contract price should be accepted withoutquestion as the value for royalty purposes. One such situation is wherethe contract does not reflect all of the consideration flowing either directlyor indirectly from the buyer to the seller. As an example, in return forSeller's reduced price for oil production from a Federal lease, Buyer mayagree to reduce the price of gas it sells to the Seller from a non-Federallease. This agreement is not reflected in the oil sales contract. In theevent that MMS becomes aware of consideration that exists outside the fourcorners of the contract, MMS could accept the lessee's gross proceeds asvalue, adjusted to reflect the additional consideration. However, in somecircumstances the additional consideration may not be easily calculable.Thus, even if the parties are not affiliated and the contract is ``arm's-length,''MMS may require in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) that the oil production be valuedin accordance with paragraph (c), the standards used to value oil disposedof under non-arm's-length contracts. Under these standards, the lessee'sgross proceeds still may determine value, but the lessee will be requiredto demonstrate comparability to other arm's-length contracts. Thus, despiteseveral industry comments suggesting that this section be deleted, MMSis retaining it in the final rules.MMS recognizes that some parties may have multiple contracts with one another.This fact alone would not cause a contract to be treated as non-arm's-length.Rather, there must be some indication that the contract in question doesnot reflect the full agreement between the parties. Although many commenters disagreed with the requirement, the final regulationsalso include a provision whereby MMS may require a lessee to certify thatthe terms of its arm's-length contract reflect all the consideration flowingfrom the buyer to the seller for the gas. The commenters believed thatvalues already were subject to audit and that was a sufficient safeguard.MMS is retaining this provision because there may be circumstances wherean auditor could not reasonably be expected to find other consideration,yet there is good reason to believe it exists. Because of the potentiallysevere penalties for a false certification, this will assure that no otherconsideration exists once the certification is received.In other situations it may not be apparent why an arm's-length contractprice is unusually low, yet the lessor should not accept the arm's-lengthcontract proceeds as value. It may be because of collusion between thebuyer and seller or improper conduct by the seller, or it could be theresult of negligence in negotiating a contract. Even if the contract isbetween unaffiliated persons and thus ``arm's-length,'' pursuant to paragraph(b)(1)(iii), if MMS determines that the gross proceeds do not reflect thereasonable value of the production because of misconduct by the contractingparties or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessorto market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor,then MMS may require that the oil production be valued pursuant to thefirst applicable of paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), (c)(4), or (c)(5). Thus,MMS first must determine that a price is unreasonable; for example, bylooking at comparable contracts and sales. Then MMS must determine thatthe unreasonably low price was the result of misconduct or a breach bythe lessee of its duty to market the production for the mutual benefitof itself and the lessor.A breach of the lessee's duty to market production to the mutual benefitof the lessee includes, but is not limited to, collusion between the producer/sellerand buyer, pricing practices found by a court or regulatory authority tobe incorrect or fraudently manipulated, or negligence in negotiating contracts.The MMS believes that new andSection; 206.102(b)(1) establishes a more definablestandard than paragraph (b)(1) of the draft final rule at 52 FR 30857 (``whetherthere may be factors which would cause the contract not to be arm's-length'').Although MMS retains the discretion under this section not to accept anarm's-length contract price as value, which many commenters thought wasa necessary provision in these regulations, there are limits on the exerciseof that discretion.Some commenters requested that the rules require MMS to give a lessee anopportunity to respond before making a finding under subsection (b)(1)(iii).Generally, the appeals regulations in 30 CFR Part 290 give the lessee suchan opportunity before a final MMS decision is made. However, MMS will givea lessee an opportunity to comment. MMS has put such a provision in therules. If valuation in accordance with the fourth and fifth benchmarks in paragraph(c) is required, then the lessee also must follow the notification requirementsof paragraph (e)(2).One Indian commenter suggested that the lessee should certify that thisis the highest price he could have received for that oil at the time ofthe sale. The same commenter also noted that MMS's regulations, at a minimum,must be consistent with the language of the Indian leases. Other Indiancommenters stated that the concept of basing royalty on gross proceedsreceived under an arm's-length contract is not in accord with the responsibilitiesof the Secretary. One of these commenters stated that ``the lease and regulationsprovide that value be determined, not gross proceeds. Gross proceeds ismerely evidence of such value. Acceptance of gross proceeds as conclusiveevidence of value is an abrogation of the Secretary's fiduciary duties,especially if the previous MMS practice of accepting reports from lesseeswithout scrutiny continues.''<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS believes that the regulations as adopted,with the changes discussed earlier, will permit the Secretary to dischargehis/her responsibilities properly. One State commenter objected to the whole approach of the regulations.It was suggested that auditors need to be given additional flexibilityto disregard deflated prices. This commenter believed that ``gross proceeds''should be set aside as a valuation method where ``outside consideration''may have caused contract prices to be reduced.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS has concluded that the final rules strikea reasonable balance between allowing MMS not to accept arm's-length contractprices in appropriate circumstances and giving the lessee some certaintythat its arm's-length prices will be acceptable as value. No additionalchanges were made.One State commenter objected to the phrase ``monitoring, review, and audit''or similar phrases which appear throughout the proposed regulations becauseit suggests that the terms listed are synonymous. An MMS review or reconciliationis not the same as a full audit. The commenter suggested that the followingparagraph be added:``( ) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the contrary,no review, reconciliation, monitoring or other like process that resultsin a redetermination by MMS of value under this section shall be consideredfinal or binding as against the Federal Government, its beneficiaries,the Indian Tribes or allottees until after full audit.''Also, the commenter suggested that the words ``lease terms, or relevantstatutes'' need to be added after the words ``requirements of these regulations''in proposed andSection; 206.102(b) and (d)(1), for purposes of clarificationand precision.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The suggested additional paragraph language hasbeen included in the final rule as andSection; 206.102(k) with minor modifications.This paragraph reflects MMS's longstanding view that a value determinationbased on limited review does not estop the MMS from redetermining thatvalue until an audit has been completed and the audit period formally closed.MMS intends, however, to prepare more detailed guidelines as to when anaudit is closed. The phrase ``lease terms, or relevant statutes'' has notbeen added to andSection; 206.102(b) because there is a provision in theregulations that in the event of conflict the lease terms govern. Likewise,all persons are subject to statutory requirements. Two suggestions were made regarding the establishment of a floor value.One Indian commenter objected to the proposed regulations because they``* * * would permit MMS to rely upon an industry honor system for valuationof Federal royalty production.'' However, if MMS's proposed valuation approachis to be adopted, they suggested that andSection; 206.102(b) be revised toread as follows:``The value of oil which is sold pursuant to a contract shall be the grossproceeds accruing, or which could accrue to the lessee, <T3>provided that </T3>such proceeds do not fall more than 10 percent belowthe greater of the highest price paid or posted for similar oil in thesame field or area. If such proceeds do fall more than 10 percent of suchprices, the value of oil in that case shall be 10 percent below the greaterof the highest price paid or posted for similar oil in the same field orarea.'' It was stated that this approach will permit MMS to have a uniformand administratively simple benchmark to establish market value, ratherthan ``evaluating each contract on a case-by-case basis in light of themany possible indicia of a sale at less than fair market value * * * .''Another Indian commenter stated that: ``The proposed regulations wouldallow substantial manipulation and undervaluation of the royalty amount.Most centrally, it is unacceptable to allow lessees to use contract pricesas the royalty value without adequate safeguards to assure a fair valuationfor the public's resources. At a minimum, only prices under <T3>genuine</T3> arm's-length contracts should be acceptable for royaltypurposes. The proposed regulations would allow collusive contracts to qualifyas `arm's-length contracts.' '' It was also stated that if MMS remainsintent upon accepting royalty on the basis of what the commenter considersto be below-value contract prices, ``we urge that MMS at least impose afloor value, such as 80 percent of the value of production as determinedunder the `value' criteria applicable to oil not sold under arm's-lengthcontracts.''<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS generally does not believe that establishmentof a ``floor value'' (other than gross proceeds) is appropriate or equitablebecause it could result in royalty being assessed on a value greater thanthe lessee received under an acceptable arm's-length contract. Where anarm's-length contract operates to set the price at which the lessee cansell the production, that contract likewise should set the royalty valuein most circumstances. However, under the lease and the regulations, MMShas the authority to establish value for royalty purposes and will do sofor non-arm's-length contracts where it is justified, even if such valueis higher than the gross proceeds received by the lessee. Also, as explainedabove, for many Indian leases, because of the specific lease terms, MMSwill compare values determined using arm's-length contract prices withthe highest price paid for a major portion of production, and generallyuse the higher of the two.One Indian commenter raised the question of what ``which could accrue''means and also pointed out that, if the value of oil is to be based ongross proceeds, the regulations need to be more precise in stating whichgross proceeds are to be used. <T3>MMS Response:</T3> The regulations include a detailed definition ofthe term ``gross proceeds.'' The MMS believes the definition is adequate.MMS has deleted the phrase ``or which could accrue'' from the final rule.Many commenters approved of the concept of valuing oil on the basis ofgross proceeds received under an arm's-length contract. Basic reasons forapproval were stated in one comment as follows: ``This standard is fairand reasonable; it will promote necessary certainty and consistency forthe lessor and lessee alike; it is based on the lease language; it is administrativelyfeasible; and it relies on an objective valuation mechanism_the market.It is appropriate in arm's-length situations because both the buyer andthe seller have agreed to be bound by the best price each thought it couldget for the duration of the contract. In such circumstances the royaltyowner's interest in securing fair market value is protected by the arm's-lengthnature of the transaction.'' The 11 industry commenters also objected touse of the phrase ``or which could accrue'' in the first sentence. Thisobjection can best be summarized in the following comment: ``Use of thephrase creates uncertainty and subjectivity and should not be implementedin regulations which must have certainty as a foundation.'' Industry commentersstated that it is unfair for the lessor to determine after the fact thatproceeds ``could be accrued.'' Also, one of these commenters noted thatlessees act in a competitive market and ``in the absence of fraud, cannotfairly be held to a <T3>post hoc</T3> determination that proceeds could have accrued.'' Oneof these commenters summarized as follows: ``In sum, the proposed definitionof `gross proceeds' is in need of substantial revision. The MMS shouldmodify it to include only those monies actually received for the sale ofproduction. Other regulations which would require payment of royaltieson phantom proceeds should also be amended accordingly.''<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS believes that gross proceeds under an arm's-lengthcontract generally constitutes the market value of a commodity. This doesnot preclude MMS from establishing a value where necessary; e.g., the contractdoes not meet MMS's standards for an arm's-length contract, the lease agreementrequires a different value, or the lessee has engaged in misconduct. Thephrase, ``or which could accrue,'' is deleted from the final rule. As notedabove, many commenters thought that this phrase would allow MMS to second-guessthe price which the lessee agreed to in its arm's-length contract by arguingthat other persons selling oil may have received higher prices_thus, moreproceeds ``could have accrued'' to the lessee. This was not MMS's purposein including the ``or which could accrue'' language in the proposed rule.Rather, MMS's intent is to ensure that royalties are paid on the full amountto which the lessee is entitled under its contract, not just on the amountof money it may actually receive from its purchaser. However, MMS is satisfiedthat the phrase ``the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee'' properlyincludes all consideration to which the lessee is entitled under its contract,not necessarily just what it receives from the buyer. Therefore, the ``orwhich could accrue'' phrase was unnecessary. Because it caused confusionas to MMS's intent, it was deleted from the final rule. Many comments were received regarding the proposed benchmark system inandSection; 206.102(c). They were about equally divided in number as to thosein favor and those opposed.Several States, Indians, and one State/Indian association objected to theproposed benchmark system. Most of these commenters supported highest postedprices using the net-back procedure as verification. One of their objectionsto the benchmark system is that the proposed methodologies are unworkableand provide no reasonable method of verification. Another objection isthat the proposed system would impair effective oversight and reduce royalties.Also, these objectors state that in their view the proposed procedureswould severely burden the audit program and, as a practical matter, wouldpreclude adequate verification of the ``lessee's declarations.'' In addition,they stated that the use of the net-back procedure is unduly restricted,and, to the contrary, should be used frequently for independent verification.They believe that more readily verifiable methods should be used to ensurethat fair-market value is being received.One of these commenters summarized a number of objections as follows: ``Historically,gross proceeds has been regarded as minimum value; however, the proposedbenchmarks appear to be primarily aimed at converting gross proceeds as<T3>the</T3> value. Gross proceeds is not necessarily fair market value.Published gross proceeds are not always all consideration received, forexample, drilling advances and special equipment lease agreements.'' Also,``* * * no mechanisms are provided to cross-check * * * values reportedunder the first three benchmarks; since MMS has taken the notion that itdoes not have the authority to obtain access to other arm's-length contractsfrom producers not obligated to report to MMS, comparisons could not bemade.'' It was also stated that ``The most effective benchmark, net backcalculation, would never be used because of the prioritized order of othervaluation methods.'' Some commenters stated that the benchmarks should not be prioritized. Rather,value should be determined by using the most applicable benchmark. Thesesame commenters recommended modifying the first benchmark to require comparisonwith other posted prices or contract prices in the field.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS believes that a prioritized benchmark systemis workable and fair. Obviously, for OCS leases, MMS has access to informationregarding all posted prices and contracts (if any). In addition, the majorityof onshore fields with Federal lands are comprised of a significant percentageof such lands (if not the majority) so that needed price information isreadily available. In many instances, Indian lands comprise a significantportion of an oil field. Where necessary, information sometimes can beobtained from the appropriate State agency. Although price and field boundarydata are available for most onshore leases, the acquisition of volume dataassociated with an arm's-length sale has been difficult to obtain. Accordingly,MMS has added andSection; 206.102(d) which provides that any Federal or Indianlessee will make available upon request to the authorized MMS, State andIndian representatives, and others, arm's-length sales and volume datafor like-quality production in the field or area or nearby fields or areas.Undoubtedly, there will be a few instances where it will be difficult toobtain needed information, but this is true of any procedure adopted.The MMS believes that, in the vast majority of cases, gross proceeds constitutemarket value. In those cases where this is not true, MMS will establishan appropriate value for royalty purposes. ``Arm's-length'' sales willnot be accepted without question. The MMS will obtain needed informationto ascertain that they are truly arm's-length as defined in the regulations.In response to comments that the first benchmark should not accept a lessee'sposted prices without some comparison of other postings in the field, MMShas modified the first benchmark. Under this benchmark, the value stillwill be the lessee's contemporaneous posted prices or oil sales contractprices used in arm's-length transactions for purchases or sales of significantquantities of like-quality oil in the same field (or, if necessary to obtaina reasonable sample, from the same area). However, the lessee also mustdemonstrate that those prices are comparable to other contemporaneous postedprices or oil sales contract prices for purchases or sales of significantquantities of like-quality oil in the same field (or area). To evaluatecomparability, the factors include price, duration, market or markets served,terms, quality of oil, volume, and such other factors as may be appropriateto reflect the value of the oil.MMS received many industry comments suggesting that the first benchmarkexclude the requirement that the lessee's own posted price or oil salescontract prices be comparable to posted prices or oil sales contract pricesof others. Because sales data of other persons often is not available,the commenters believe that uncertainty has unnecessarily been introducedinto the process. One industry commenter believed that the benchmark, asrevised, would be workable and provide sufficient flexibility.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS believes that the first benchmark will beretained, as revised, in the second draft final rule. This benchmark bestensures that the lessee's non-arm's-length prices are reasonable determinantsof value.One Indian commenter criticized the benchmark system as follows: ``Theutter failure of MMS to recognize its obligation to maximize tribal royaltiesis evidenced also in the provisions governing valuations where arm'slengthcontracts do not exist. Each of the three alternative methods require adetermination that the lessee's sales price is similar to that for purchasesof significant quantities of like oil in the same field or area. The MMS,however, relies on lessee-generated information for that determinationand, moreover, relies upon the truthfulness of that information. For example,under alternative number one, MMS proposes to look at the lessee's contemporaryposted prices. Posted prices in the oil industry, however, are generatedby the purchasers and not the sellers. Either MMS had made an error inits drafting or this benchmark plainly is so ridden with potential conflictsof interest that it can not possibly be urged as consistent with the Federalfiduciary duty to maximize Indian oil and gas resource returns.''Another Indian commenter suggested that the desired goal of certainty canbe accomplished by use of the highest price paid method: ``MMS' embracementof the contract price approach in its drive towards certainty in valuecan be as easily achieved through the highest price paid method. It wouldalso encourage producers when negotiating contracts to come as close tothat figure as possible knowing that is what they will have to pay theroyalty on. The contract sales approach proposed by MMS does not encourageobtaining the maximum value for the resource by the purchaser [lessee].''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>In many instances the lessee, being a purchaser,has published a posted price bulletin. Posted price bulletins are generallyavailable. In addition, the lessee must retain all data which are subjectto audit. From experience, MMS does not believe that basing all royaltieson the highest price in the field or area is fair or in the best interestsof the Federal or Indian lessor. Therefore, such a standard was not adopted.One State commenter noted that the modifier ``contemporaneous'' in threeof the sections is vague and undefined. ``For a purchase under a postingor contract to be used as an indicia of value for the monthly reportingperiod, it should relate to production during the same reporting period.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>MMS has added andSection; 206.102(c)(6) to the finalrule which defines ``contemporaneous'' as postings or prices in effectat the time the royalty obligation is incurred. This means the postingsor contract prices in effect at the time oil is removed, sold, or otherwisedisposed of in a manner which results in royalty being due on the oil.According to one State commenter, ``It is difficult to establish an alternativesystem to calculate fair market value * * *. The MMS should use the postedprice criteria of the benchmark system verified by a ne-tback analysisto assure the credibility of posted prices.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS believes that the use of a routine net-backanalysis on a routine basis to verify oil value is impractical and unnecessary.Two Indian commenters expressed concern about the prioritized benchmarksystem. They argued that restricting the Secretary's ability to use differentmethodologies in any order the Secretary chooses will tie the Secretary'shands in dealing with difficult situations. <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS believes that the regulations adopted willpermit the Secretary to discharge his/her responsibilities to the Tribesand allottees and will provide certainty in the valuation process to boththe lessees and lessors. Although a prioritized benchmark system does limitflexibility, this drawback is outweighed by the benefits of certainty.One State commenter thought there is a lack of guidance in administeringthe prioritized benchmark system and that MMS does not indicate what kindof evidence will be sufficient to permit an auditor to continue down thelist of benchmarks.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS will require that the lessee make a reasonableeffort to apply a benchmark before proceeding to the next. Auditors mustbe satisfied that lessee information is sufficiently accurate and completeto implement a benchmark. The addition of andSection; 206.102(d), wherebylessees must provide arm's-length sales and volume information, will assistin the enforcement of these ``comparability'' requirements. It would beimpossible for MMS to attempt to implement a procedure where governmenthas to make all the decisions. Such a procedure would impose a tremendousadministrative burden which would be very costly.Some industry and State commenters expressed concern regarding the lackof an adequate definition of the terms ``significant quantities'' and ``fieldor area'', and the administrative problems that will result therefrom.One State commenter stated that the term ``significant quantities'' isvague and undefined. An industry commenter recommended that the term ``significantquantities'' be deleted because (1) posted prices in an open marketplace``are for no other purpose than determining market value'', and (2) thelessee has no way of knowing the quantity of volumes purchased by otherpurchasers in the area.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>As was discussed in the preamble to the proposedrules (52 FR 1858, January 15, 1987), the term ``significant quantities''is variable depending on the sales volumes from the field and the volumeof production. What constitutes significant production from an onshorefield may not be significant for an OCS field. Therefore, ``significantquantities'' will vary case by case.One Indian commenter stated that ``* * * many posted prices are artificiallylow because there is low demand, but there is still a threshold low amountwhere a company will purchase more than their demand'' and recommendedthat ``* * * the totality of the circumstances should be utilized (andset forth in the regulations), including spot markets, highest posted prices,and to some extent, posting for similar oil in other fields.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The current regulations, which are being revisedin response to heavy criticism, list the various criteria with no specificpriority. The purpose of the benchmark system is to provide all concernedwith a reasonable degree of certainty as to criteria to be used in valuingoil. One Industry commenter stated that the prioritized benchmark system ``imposesa prejudicial valuation on an affiliated lessee'' because a nonaffiliatereceiving the same price as an affiliate would pay on actual proceeds received,whereas the affiliate may have to pay a higher royalty under, for example,benchmark 206.102(c)(2). The recommendation was made that ``* * * the firstapplicable of the following subsections ``* * * language in andSection; 206.102(c)be replaced with ``* * * any of the applicable subsections.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The situation described could occur. However, MMSbelieves that, generally, posted prices for like-quality oil in the samefield or area will be comparable. Thus, there likely will be little orno disparity in the values in most situations.Many industry commenters, a Federal agency, and an individual approvedof the proposed benchmark system. One industry commenter stated that they``* * * strongly support the adoption of clear and consistent standardsof valuation for royalty oil based upon the true value of the product_theprice received in the marketplace for the sale of that oil. The valuationproposal * * * recognizes the interaction of competing market forces andrecognizes that a seller of oil will normally negotiate the best deal itcan to further its own interests. The use of a price that is generallyavailable to all sellers is a much more reasonable approach to the determinationof `value' for a given supply of oil than the arbitrary selection of aprice that one seller may have received under circumstances that do notinclude all sellers. Where an arm's-length contract does not exist, thebenchmark system of valuation permits an objective procedure for arrivingat the valuation based upon posted prices which have been the basis forsales of oil for many years.'' Another industry commenter supported boththe benchmarks and their prioritization because both will add certaintyto valuation determinations. Also, the use of the lessee's contemporaneousposting will provide a ``benchmark valuation for many major producers.''One industry commenter noted that ``This ordering of the benchmarks isthe result of extensive public comment which showed that, for valuationof oil, posted prices should be moved closer to the top of the hierarchyinsofar as posted prices account for the vast majority of oil transactions.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS believes that the proposed benchmark systemis a valid and realistic system for determining the value of oil not soldpursuant to an arm's-length contract. The benchmarks are primarily basedon posted prices which are the normal basis for oil sales and which reflectthe price of oil in a free and open market. Posted price information forsignificant quantities of like-quality oil sold from a field or area willnormally be available. The addition of andSection; 206.102(d) will permitnecessary information on arm's-length sales to be obtained. In other situations,the benchmarks provide for use of spot sale prices, net-back, or any otherreasonable method.One industry commenter noted that most, if not all, posted prices are pricesposted by a purchasing, marketing, or transporting entity, some of whichmay have producing lessee affiliates. ``However, taken literally, therewill not be a <T3>lessee's </T3>posted price.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>MMS has added a new andSection; 206.102(c)(6) whichdefines lessee, for purposes of this section, as including a designatedpurchasing agent.One State commenter noted that proposed andSection; 206.102(c)(1) fails toanticipate that a lessee could make purchases at different postings withinthe same reporting period and suggests that, in such a case, ``the volumeweighted average would seem to be appropriately specified, because it couldbe easily computed by the payor and would be less susceptible to manipulationby the payor.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS concurs with this change and has includedlanguage to implement it in andSection; 206.102(c)(1).One Indian commenter stated that the use of this benchmark (contemporaneousposted prices) rather than the major-portion analysis provided for in existingoil and gas regulations represents a breach of the Secretary's trust obligations.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS believes that the regulations as adoptedwill permit the Secretary to discharge his/her responsibilities. Majorportion analysis will be used under the final regulations, where appropriate.Some industry commenters recommended that legal characteristics of theoil be included in the comparability criteria in paragraph (c)(1).<T3>MMS Response: </T3>This addition is unnecessary because the sectionalready refers to like-quality oil, which is defined as including legalcharacteristics.One industry commenter recommended that paragraph (c)(2) be modified byadding the phrase ``known to the lessee'' after the word ``prices'' sothat the first part of the sentence would read, ``The arithmetic averageof contemporaneous posted prices, known to the lessee, used in arm's-lengthtransactions * * * .''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>This suggestion was not adopted because it resultsin too great a degree of subjectivity. One industry commenter supported the use of ``arithmetic average'' as abenchmark, but suggested that there should either be an agreement betweenthe lessees and MMS as to which companies' postings are to be used, orthat MMS publish a list of the companies whose postings may be used tocalculate an arithmetic average. The commenter pointed out that in thecase of South Louisiana (used for offshore) there are at least one dozencompanies that post oil prices and there could be price changes in onemonth on different dates by all of the companies.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS may decide, upon request, on the basis ofan individual case, to designate postings to be used in calculating anarithmetic average. It is not considered practical to do this continuously.Three Indian commenters objected to the use of ``arithmetic average'' andrecommended that a ``weighted average'' be used instead. Another commenterstated that use of ``arithmetic average will not yield a true market valuebecause the lessee is given the opportunity to manipulate prices by sellingsome oil at extremely depressed prices.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>Paragraph (c)(2) requires consideration of postingsof persons other than the lessee. Although the postings are available tothe lessee and to MMS, volumes often are not. Thus, requiring a weightaveraging of third party data is not practical.To make this benchmark ``more workable and administratively feasible''one industry commenter recommended using the average of all postings ofthe relevant type of oil in an area. <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS has found that postings do not always indicatea purchaser's willingness to buy. Therefore, any average which includesall postings may become skewed because of posted prices which are not marketresponsive. Pursuant to andSection; 206.102(c) (1), (2), and (3), there mustbe significant quantities of oil sold before a posting or contract pricecan be averaged in.One industry commenter recommended that paragraph (c)(3) be modified byadding the phrase ``known to the lessee'' after the word ``contracts'',and by replacing the phrase ``area or nearby areas'' with the phrase ``fieldor area'' for reasons of ``clarification.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The addition of the phrase ``known to the lessee''was not adopted because it would result in inserting too great a degreeof subjectivity. The term ``field or area'' was not adopted because theintent is to utilize a larger area than ``field or area'' in reviewingarm's-length contract prices.One industry commenter suggested that MMS should publish a list of postingsto be used to compute the arithmetic average required by subsections (2)and (3). It was thought that the large number of postings creates a monitoringand auditing/validation burden.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>MMS recognizes that in some cases there may be severalpostings which will be required to be averaged. However, the informationis available and it is not that burdensome for lessees. In fact, MMS expectsthat in certain fields lessees will be able to work together to computeaverages which may be applicable to all of them.One State commenter stated that ``Subparts (iii) and (iv) attempt to distinguishbetween arm's-length contracts and spot sales. But, there is no basis forsaying arm's-length spot sales are not also arm's-length contracts underthe definitions. Additionally, there is no requirement (and there shouldbe) that only spot sales which are genuinely arm's-length should qualifyas indicia of royalty value.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS concurs that the spot sales used in thebenchmark should be arm's-length spot sales and will insert the term ``arm's-length''immediately preceding ``spot sales'' in the final rule, andSection; 206.102(c)(4).With regard to the first comment, if a spot sale is for a significant quantityof oil, it could be considered under paragraph (c)(3).Some States and Indians stated that when applying benchmarks, it shouldnot be necessary in all circumstances to consider all other sales in thefield. In other instances, it may be necessary to look beyond the field.MMS agrees that the size of the sample cannot be predetermined but mustdepend upon the terms of the applicable benchmark and the actual circumstancesin the field or area.Most of the State and Indian commenters who opposed the benchmark systemsupported highest posted price with the use of a net-back method for verificationof values used. One of the State commenters, in describing MMS's proposeduse of net-back in proposed andSection; 206.102(c)(5) as too restrictive,made the following statements: ``* * * the government would carry the burdenof establishing that none of the preceeding benchmarks can be applied beforeit would [be] authorized to use net-back * * * In effect, net-back willrarely, if ever, be used. At the same time it is the only method of valuationproposed by MMS that can be applied independently from lessee submitteddocumentation.'' <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS agrees that there will be infrequent useof the net-back method. It is believed, however, that the other benchmarkswhich have higher priority will result in a reasonable value for royaltypurposes and obviate the need to undertake a labor-intensive net-back method.The MMS routinely will verify lessee-generated information used in applyingthe benchmarks during its monitoring process and through audit.One State commenter articulated the viewpoint of a large number of othercommenters by recommending an alternative method of valuation, namely useof the highest posted price paid or offered in the field or area with thenet-back procedure used as verification or backup.The commenter also stated that ``* * * the approach we suggest_highestposted or a refined product value net-back_serves the twin goals of assuringthe collection of fair market value and providing certainty to the lessee.Highest [price] posted or paid is more easily determined than the arm's-lengthnature of a contract, and a refined product value can be calculated bythe lessee itself or provided by the government. It also is an approachthat is independent of lessee generated information and thus meets Congress'intent that independent methods of verification be employed. Gross proceedswould continue as the absolute minimum acceptable value.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS believes that gross proceeds received underarm's-length contracts and posted prices used to purchase significant quantitiesof oil in arm's-length transactions generally represent the market valueof oil and does not agree that it is necessary to perform a refined productnet-back analysis to verify them.One industry commenter expressed approval of the concept in proposed paragraph(e)(1) that prior MMS approval generally need not be obtained where valueis determined pursuant to paragraph (c). One Indian commenter expressedconcern that ``once approval is granted, follow-up audits are unlikely'',and recommended that ``There should be provisions mandating routine MMSaudits of valuation methods occurring at intervals not greater than oneyear.'' One industry commenter objected to the fact that MMS will not begiving prior approval stating that this subsection places ``the burden* * * on the producer to prove the determination of value.'' One Statecommenter stated that the regulation should specify that the lessee retain``all data relevant to determination of royalty value,'' instead of ``allavailable data to support its determination of value.'' That State commenterstated that the regulation should specify that MMS ``will'' order compliancewhen incorrect payments are discovered, rather than stating ``MMS may directa lessee to use a different value.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>Although MMS will be making periodic audits, itis not appropriate to specify the scheduling, type, and timing of auditsin these regulations. With regard to the second comment, the lessee isresponsible to comply fully with the regulations by properly valuing theoil, for royalty purposes, in accord with the appropriate benchmark andto retain all relevant data. The MMS has adopted the suggestion that thephrase ``all data relevant to determination of royalty value'' be substitutedfor ``all available data to support its determination of value'' in andSection;206.102(e)(1). Also, the word ``will'' has been substituted for the word``may'' in the last sentence.Many industry commenters stated that the requirements of andSection; 206.102(d) and (e) to make all data available to MMS are too broad and shouldbe limited to fee lands within the boundaries of approved Federal unitsor communitized areas. They argued that lessees should not be requiredto provide information on their other sales prices or volumes. <T3>MMS Response: </T3>Because lessees, in many instances, will be determiningvalue for Federal or Indian production by reference to other sales in thefield or area, MMS must have access to the data to the same extent as thelessee to determine whether the lessee's valuation was in accordance withthe regulations.Section 206.102(f) was proposed as andSection; 206.102(e) and provides thatlessees will pay additional royalties and interest if the lessees improperlydetermine value. One industry commenter recommended that any ``retroactivevaluation determinations'' on the part of MMS ``be limited to fraudulentand noncompliance situations.'' That commenter went on to suggest thatif MMS determines that a lessee underpaid royalties, then the interestassociated with those royalties should only accrue from the date of thatdetermination until royalties are paid.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The lessee is responsible for properly determiningvalue for royalty purposes in accordance with the lease terms, regulations,and appropriate instructions and court decisions. Accordingly, if royaltyis underpaid, the lessee is responsible for the additional royalty dueplus any interest from the time such payment(s) should have been made.MMS has adopted this section as it was proposed.Another industry commenter agreed that underpayment of royalties was subjectto interest, but recommended that MMS likewise should pay the lessee/payorany interest ``statutorily authorized'' on reimbursed credits or royaltyoffsets when royalty overpayments are discovered.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS is barred by law from paying interest onroyalty overpayments, but is required by law (i.e., FOGRMA) to collectinterest on late payments.Section 206.102(g) was proposed as andSection; 206.102(f) and prescribesa procedure for a lessee to request a value determination from MMS. Someindustry commenters suggested that there be a time limit of 120 days forMMS valuation responses. Some of these commenters also recommended thatthere be no penalties or accrual of interest for any underpayment of royaltiesduring this period (which would not be known until after MMS's decision).<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS will make every effort to respond timely,but this is necessarily dependent upon available resources. MMS cannotagree to a regulatory time limit. Because the lessee is responsible forproper valuation, interest is assessed if the lessee makes an impropervaluation. The MMS believes a lessee should be able to request a valuationdetermination at any time. One of the changes to this section clarifiesthat, when MMS makes a value determination, it may use any of the valuationcriteria authorized by the rules. This gives MMS the necessary flexibilityto deal with unusual situations which otherwise do not fit the regulations.One commenter suggested that there should be opportunity for review ofa value determination by the affected royalty recipient (State, Tribe,etc.) before a final decision is made because, without such review, thecooperative audit role is rendered meaningless.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS does not consider it practical to requirea review by a State or an Indian lessor when a value determination is made.The MMS will attempt to coordinate its value determinations with Statesdoing audits under section 205 of FOGRMA and Indian Tribes doing auditsunder section 202 of FOGRMA. This does not make the cooperative audit role,in accordance with FOGRMA, less meaningful or effective.One industry commenter recommended that the provision be clarified thatan MMS rejection of a proposed valuation determination is appealable toeither the Director or Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA).<T3>MMS Response: </T3>This modification is not necessary because all MMSfinal orders or decisions arising from the regulations in Titles 25, 30,and 43 are appealable pursuant to 30 CFR Parts 243 and 290.One Indian commenter recommended that lessors also should be able to requestMMS determinations. They also recommended that the regulations should requireMMS to notify Tribes/allottees of any changes in valuation determinations.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The regulations as adopted in andSection; 206.102(g)do not provide a specific procedure for the Indian lessor to request avaluation determination from MMS. However, MMS always is available to discusswith Indian lessors any valuation issue regarding their leases.One State commenter recommended that the third sentence be modified byadding the word ``all'' before ``available data'', and replacing ``to supportits proposal'' with ``relevant to the valuation of its production''. Also,the phrase ``subject to audit'' should be added. <T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS has made some of these changes for purposesof clarity and comprehensiveness.Section 206.102(h) was proposed as andSection; 206.102(g). It provides thatthe value for royalty purposes cannot be less than the gross proceeds accruingto the lessee for lease production, less applicable allowances. Severalindustry respondents considered the phrase ``or which could accrue'' objectionableand urged its deletion. The main reason given for their position is thatthe language creates uncertainty and subjectivity, contrary to MMS's statedobjective of gaining certainty and precision in royalty accounting. <T3>MMS Response:</T3> MMS has deleted the phrase ``which could accrue''from the final rule. As explained above, with respect to andSection; 206.102(b),MMS is satisfied that the term ``accruing'' includes all considerationto which the lessee is entitled pursuant to its contract, not just whatit actually receives.Industry commenters suggested that some off-lease post production costs(such as those carried out on leases in ``especially hostile or remoteenvironments'') and certain onlease post-production costs (such as thosedeemed to be ``extraordinary'' for onshore leases, the cost of submergedgathering lines, the cost of environmental compliance, and the cost ofpost-production facilities installed on leases in water depths greaterthan 400 feet for offshore leases) should be shared by the lessor and countedas deductions from royalty payments along with transportation allowances.One stated rationale for this suggestion is that some ``post-production''costs enhance the value of the oil and, therefore, the costs should beshared by both lessee and lessor, as are the benefits. One commenter simplystated that the phrase ``and other deductions'' should be added to the``less applicable transportation allowances'' language.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS has modified andSection; 206.102(h) to referto deductions for any applicable allowance. As explained below, however,MMS has not adopted a rule which would provide for deduction of certainextraordinary costs. State commenters objected to the deduction of transportation allowancesfrom value and particularly from the gross proceeds, especially if grossproceeds is considered a ``minimum value.'' One of the commenters statedthat the ``less transportation allowances'' language is particularly confusingbecause ``it suggests that lessees can deduct the allowance from the valuedetermination'' rather than as a separate line item as required by andSection;206.105(c)(4) of the final rule.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> Section 206.102(a) provides that the value for royaltypurposes is the value determined in accordance with andSection; 206.102 (i.e.,arm's-length gross proceeds or a value determined using benchmarks) lessapplicable allowances. The purpose of andSection; 206.102(h) is to make itclear that, no matter what valuation method is used, the value for royaltypurposes cannot be less than the lessee's gross proceeds less applicableallowances. Therefore, if a benchmark-derived value less applicable allowancesis less than gross proceeds less applicable allowances, gross proceedsless applicable allowances is to be used as the value for royalty purposes.In either event, the lessee may be entitled to deduct transportation allowancesto determine value, for royalty purposes, at the lease (unless the benchmark-derivedvalue already is a value at the lease_in that even no further transportationallowance would be authorized.)Section 206.102(i) was proposed as andSection; 206.102(h). This section addressesthe lessee's obligation to place lease production in marketable condition.Five industry commenters opposed the concept that the lessee is responsiblefor placing the product in marketable condition at no cost to the lessorand recommended specific deletion of language in the proposed regulationto accomplish this. One industry commenter recommended that the language``unless otherwise provided in the lease agreement'' be added at the endof the first sentence, and another industry commenter pointed out thatthe lessor does share in marketable condition costs under net-profit-shareleases.The MMS specifically requested comment on a provision in the draft finalrules which would provide an allowance for certain production related costsin extraordinary situations. Many comments were received from industrysupporting this provision and suggesting that it be broadened.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> Historically, MMS's policy and practice is thatthe lessee is responsible for placing the lease product in marketable conditionat no cost to the lessor. This practice has been upheld by court decision.The MMS has adopted the suggestion that the language ``unless otherwiseprovided in the lease agreement'' be added at the end of the first sentencebecause there are a few leases in which the lessor shares in such costs.Also, as noted earlier, MMS received many comments that so-called post-productioncosts should be allowed as a deduction in determining value for royaltypurposes. Generally, these costs are not allowed as a deduction becausethey are necessary to make production marketable. The MMS received many comments on the section added to the draft finalrules that provided for certain extraordinary cost allowances. State andsome Indian commenters thought that this section was an unwarranted exceptionfrom the requirement that the lessee is obligated to bear the costs ofplacing oil in marketable condition or that further restrictions shouldbe included, while one Indian commenter endorsed the principle introducedby this new section. Industry commenters generally thought that the newsection was a step in the right direction, but thought that the dual qualificationprocess was too rigid. They suggested that the extraordinary allowancebe granted if a lessee could meet the requirements of either paragraphs(2)(i) or (2)(ii). Industry commenters also suggested that the referenceto 400 meters be changed to 400 feet because that is the point at whichcosts begin to escalate significantly. They also thought that use of theterm ``unique'' was inappropriate because it would limit the applicabilityto only the first lessee with a particular type of extraordinary operation.Some commenters also requested that once approved, the allowance shouldextend beyond one year.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> After carefully considering all of the commentson this issue, MMS has decided not to retain the extraordinary cost allowanceprovision in the final rules. It was concluded that the burdens placedon the lessee by the environment in which it must operate were matterstaken into account at the time the lease was issued, affecting the amountsof bonus bids and in some cases the royalty rate. The MMS has determinedthat if a lessee is entitled to further economic relief, it is inappropriateto provide that relief by adjusting the value of the production by methodswhich are inconsistent with MMS's historical practice and interpretationof the lessee's express obligation to place production in marketable conditionat no cost to the lessor. Rather, the more appropriate mechanism is forthe Department to consider royalty rate relief in circumstances where itis warranted for existing leases, and for lessees to consider such factorswhen entering leases in the future.Section 206.102(j) was proposed as andSection; 206.102(i). There were severalcomments on this section from industry, States, and Indians. The majorityof the comments were negative in some respect; only two commenters (oneindustry and one State) concurred with the proposed regulation as written.State and industry commenters recommended deleting the regulation in itsentirety, indicating that the regulation is inappropriate in the contextof oil sales because the majority of oil is sold under monthly posted pricesand is not normally subject to contractual price escalations or increments.They suggested that the regulation is more appropriate to gas sales contractsand does not belong as an oil valuation standard.One industry commenter argued that MMS has neither the authority nor theexpertise to determine ``the highest price a prudent lessee can receivethrough legally enforceable claims under its contract.'' The commenteralso suggested deleting most of this section with the exception of thethird sentence (of the second draft final rule) and the requirement thatthe lessee must pay royalties on all volumes of production which are sold.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>Although the large majority of oil is sold underposted price bulletins, the division order, which sets forth the divisionof proceeds and is signed by all interest owners, is considered to constitutethe ``contract'' for purposes of these regulations.Several modifications, many taking issue with the ``prudent operator''concept, were suggested as follows:Two industry commenters suggested deleting the first sentence (``Valueshall be based on the highest price a prudent operator can receive underits contract'') because (1) it countermands the use of the actual proceedsbenchmark system established in andSection; 206.102 (b) and (c); and (2)the requirement of a lessee to obtain the highest theoretical price, regardlessof the cost involved in obtaining that price, may contradict the definitionof ``prudent operator'' found in the draft coal regulations at andSection;206.5(nn) and, therefore, ignores ``the realities of the marketplace andthe courthouse and unfairly precludes the lessee from exercising soundbusiness judgment.''One industry commenter recommended revising the paragraph to conform tothe reasonable value standard of andSection; 206.102 generally. Here thecommenter argued that the ``highest price'' standard of this subsectionis in direct opposition to the reasonable value standards of previous subsections,thus causing the proposed rulemaking to be contradictory. <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS has modified the first sentence of the finalrule to read ``Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lesseecan receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract.'' Asnoted in the preamble to the proposed rule, this section prescribes a diligenceconcept. As discussed above, with regard to the concept of gross proceeds``accruing'' to a lessee, MMS requires a lessee to pay royalty on thatvalue which it was entitled to get. These regulations reflect MMS's willingnessgenerally to accept arm's-length contract prices as value, but there isa concomitant obligation on the part of the lessee to obtain all to whichthe lessee is entitled under its contract. If it fails to take such reasonablemeasures, MMS will assess royalty on the prices which reasonably couldhave been obtained in accordance with the contract.One industry commenter suggested changing the fourth sentence to read ``thelessee will owe no additional royalty <T3>unless or </T3>until monies are * * * received'' in cases of disputedpayments. <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS has adopted this suggested modificationas consistent with its intent. However, this provision does not permita lessee to avoid paying royalties where a purchaser has failed to pay,in whole or in part or timely, for a quantity of oil.One State respondent suggested that an explicit provision for the assessmentof interest for delayed payments should be added, with such a requirementbeing an equitable compromise for the lessor's agreement to delay enforcementof its rights to the timely payment of full royalties.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>When a matter is being legally contested betweenthe parties, and the lessee has taken appropriate legal action, MMS's policyis not to require payment of the amount in dispute until the lessee actuallyreceives it. If a purchaser fails completely to pay for a volume of production,royalties still are due the month following the month of sale or otherdisposition. In all cases, interest is due if the royalties are paid late.However, in the case of disputed price increments, the royalties are notdue until the end of the month following the month that the lessee receivesthem.An Indian commenter also suggested that the last sentence should be clarifiedto make explicit that the bankruptcy of a purchaser of oil should not permita lessee to avoid its royalty payment obligation.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS believes that the language already encompassesa bankruptcy situation and recognizes that the lessee still has an obligationto pay its royalties.Section 206.102(k) provides that no redetermination of value by MMS asthe result of review, reconciliation, monitoring or a like process is finalor binding against the lessor until the audit period is formally closed.MMS intends to issue additional guidelines as to when an audit period isclosed.Several industry commenters thought that any determinations by MMS shouldbe binding.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS is adopting this section. The MMS cannotbe bound by a preliminary determination which may not be based on a fullarray of information as would be available during an audit.Section 206.102(l) was proposed as andSection; 206.102(j). Comments werereceived from three State and six Indian representatives objecting to therestrictive terms/effect of this paragraph. In general, the comments pointedout that the requirement to obtain valuation information through Freedomof Information Act (FOIA) requests would inhibit Indian Tribes, allottees,and States from gaining access to the information required to assure thatvaluations are properly determined. In particular, ``The second sentenceof the proposed regulation appears to be an unlawful effort to precludethe exercise of departmental discretion under FOIA to voluntarily releasenonproprietary data to royalty owners on a case-by-case basis. The thirdsentence appears to prohibit tribes and allottees from requesting suchinformation through the BIA.'' It was generally recommended that the paragraphshould be clarified to indicate that all valuation information should beavailable to States, Indian Tribes, and allottees without going throughFOIA procedures. (Two Indian commenters offered specific language thatcould be appended to the paragraph to clarify its intent regarding thesharing of information with authorized parties.)<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The intent of this paragraph was not to precludeaccess allowed by law, but rather to ensure the lessee that disclosureof proprietary information is in accordance with established procedures.There are statutory restrictions on providing certain types of informationto persons outside the Department of the Interior, and MMS must act inaccordance with those limitations. States and Indians with FOGRMA delegationsand cooperative agreements will have broader access to information whichotherwise could not be released. This section is not intended to limitin any manner an Indian lessor's right to obtain information directly fromthe lessor or from MMS to the extent provided in lease terms or applicablelaw.In the draft final rule, MMS changed the phrase ``will be maintained''to ``may be maintained.'' Many industry commenters were concerned thatthis change would allow MMS to release proprietary information. This wasnot MMS's intent, and to avoid any confusion the term ``will'' has beensubstituted for ``may.'' Section 206.103 Point of royalty settlement.Several industry representatives and a few States commented on this section.The State commenters recommended that andSection; 206.103 be strengthenedby defining standards for establishing the point of royalty settlementand thereby minimizing pipeline losses. Lease or unit boundaries were suggestedas the point of royalty settlement for onshore production, and the entranceto the first onshore facility was suggested for OCS production.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>These regulations pertain to the valuation of oiland are not concerned with the criteria for the point of royalty settlement.The point of royalty settlement is authorized by MMS operations officesfor Federal OCS leases and by BLM for onshore Federal and Indian leases.Two industry commenters addressed the clarity and intent of andSection; 206.103(a)(2).One of these commenters pointed out that the reference to an adjustmentfor differences in quality and quantity (such as for basic sediment andwater) was unclear, asking what adjustments would apply and how these wouldbe made. The other commenter recommended deleting the paragraph altogetherbecause only the quantity and quality actually measured at the point ofroyalty settlement should be used for royalty computations.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The paragraph cannot be deleted because there aresituations, usually onshore, where the gross proceeds accruing to a lesseeare based upon the quantity and quality of oil at a point that is differentthan the point of royalty settlement specified by BLM to be used in calculatingFederal or Indian royalty, usually at the tank battery on the lease. Inthis situation, the quantity and quality criteria measured at the tankbattery on the lease must be used to determine the proper value, which,because the quantity of oil at the contractual sales point is less, willbe greater than the lessee's gross proceeds.Many commenters from industry objected to the provision of andSection; 206.103(b)disallowing actual or theoretical losses between the point of royalty settlementand the actual delivery point. They pointed out that pipeline losses arean integral part of transportation over which the lessees/operators haveno control and thus should be an allowable component of transportationdeductions. They also pointed out that disallowance of losses is contraryto the concept of accepting gross proceeds under arm's-length transactionsbecause the lessor's royalty may be calculated on a different basis thanwhat the lessee is paid by the purchaser. <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The issue addressed here deals with volume and qualitymeasurements upon which royalty must be based. The issue of line lossesbeing included as a component of transportation deductions is addressedin the section of the regulations dealing with transportation (andSection;andSection;206.104 and 206.105).One industry commenter suggested that andSection; 206.103(b) be clarifiedregarding load oil, and recommended that the section be modified to specificallyexclude load oil from royalty obligation.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The determination of whether or not load oil isconsidered to be royalty-bearing is a function of lease terms and the originof the oil so used, and is generally the responsibility of the BLM andMMS OCS operations personnel for onshore and OCS leases, respectively.As such, no specific language was added to address this issue.Section 206.104 Transportation allowances_general.Comments on transportation allowances that did not relate to any specificsection of the regulations were classified in the General section of theoil transportation regulations. Although there were comments on a widevariety of subjects, they have been grouped as follows: Post-productioncosts, validity issues, adequacy/inadequacy issues, cost issues, Royalty-In-Kind(RIK) issues, and issues relating to the definition of terms.Many commenters addressed the issue of whether or not MMS should allowlessees to deduct all post-production costs from royalty payments. Transportationcosts are one type of post-production cost. MMS will not respond to thatissue again in this section because it was fully addressed in the discussionof andSection; 206.102(i). Moreover, because the final rules provide an allowancefor transportation costs, it is unnecessary to consider whether such costsalso are to be considered ``post-production costs.''Many commenters addressed the validity of any transportation allowanceswhatsoever and proposed that MMS should not consider transportation allowancesas valid deductions from royalty computations, or only consider such allowancesif transportation is necessary for lease development or results in a higherroyalty.Six State and five Indian commenters stated that transportation allowancesshould not be granted unless necessary to sell the product or to promotedevelopment, or unless the transportation results in a higher royalty value.Six Indian and one State commenter stated that MMS should not grant anytransportation allowances under any circumstances.One Indian commenter stated that the regulations should not be allowedto change the lease terms. According to this commenter, the granting oftransportation allowances is, in effect, a change to the lease terms.Two Indian commenters stated that MMS must take into account its responsibilityto Tribes and allottees in preparing the regulations and must determinethe fairness and reasonableness of all transportation allowances.One industry commenter stated that the reason that MMS grants allowancesis because certain Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) decisions requiredthat transportation be considered when determining product value on whichroyalty is based. Another industry commenter stated that MMS should granta transportation allowance even if the product value is determined at thelease, if the sales contract required the lessee to incur the expense oftransporting the oil to the point of sale.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>On the basis of decisions by the Interior Boardof Land Appeals (IBLA), Solicitor's opinions, and judicial decisions, ithas been longstanding MMS policy to grant transportation allowances whenoil is transported to a sales point off the lease in order to calculatethe value of the product at the lease. Furthermore, the IBLA has ruledthat transportation allowances must be granted for Indian leases. <T3>Kerr-McGee Corp., </T3>22 IBLA 124 (1975). Therefore, the regulationsbeing adopted are consistent with past practice and are consistent withthe Secretary's responsibility to the Indians. The MMS believes that royaltyshould be free of production and marketing costs. However, values may haveto be adjusted for transportation and/or processing in determining valueat the lease.The MMS agrees that the proposed procedure for determining a transportationallowance places a great deal of reliance on the oil industry. However,this program will be under continuous review and oversight by MMS. Thereis nothing in the final oil transportation allowance regulations that wouldchange the terms of any Indian lease. The MMS believes that the policyof granting transportation allowances is appropriate and should continue.Another issue centered around the adequacy or inadequacy of the proposedoil transportation regulations in general. Some commenters believed thatthe regulations are completely flawed, while others pointed to specificinstances where changes should be made to improve their specific applicability.One industry commenter suggested that MMS should approve the use of contractprices which are net of transportation costs. Another industry commenterstated that the regulations should be revised to eliminate the allegedbias against frontier and deep-water areas. They also recommended the eliminationof the ceiling on transportation allowances. Another industry commenterstated that the regulations should be modified to embrace both traditionaland nontraditional transportation arrangements.Two industry commenters stated that, in their view, the proposed regulationsserve as a disincentive for companies to build and operate transportationfacilities. One industry commenter stated that the oil transportation regulationsshould be revised to achieve certainty by adopting a more rational andrealistic approach.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>In response to comments received, MMS has changedthe regulations to recognize that, in arm's-length situations where thespecified price is reduced by a transportation factor, the lessee doesnot have to report the transportation factor as a transportation allowance.The MMS also recognizes that transportation costs for frontier and deep-waterareas may be extraordinarily high and may exceed 50 percent of the valueof oil. Because of this concern, MMS has adopted a provision in the finalregulations to permit the transportation allowance to exceed the 50-percentlimitation with approval from MMS. As the general rule, however, the transportationallowance authorized by the regulations may not exceed 50 percent of thevalue of the oil at the point of sale on the basis of a selling arrangement.The MMS has decided that pre-approval of all transportation allowancesis not a cost-effective procedure. The 50-percent threshold merely givesMMS the ability to monitor more closely the situation where the allowance,based on reasonable actual costs, will exceed that limit.The MMS received a number of comments relating to transportation allowancesfor RIK oil. Industry commenters stated that MMS should grant a transportationallowance for onshore RIK oil. Another industry commenter suggested thatthe regulations should clearly state that the lessee is not required totransport RIK oil from the lease. Other industry commenters stated thatthis section was in conflict with andSection; 208.8 of the proposed RIK regulations.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The suggestion that MMS should grant a transportationallowance for onshore RIK oil was not adopted because the onshore leaseterms provide that the in-kind oil will be made available to the lessoron the lease at no cost to the lessor. The MMS believes that there is noneed to state explicitly that the lessee is not required to transport onshoreRIK oil. Many of these issues will be addressed in MMS's revisions to theRIK regulations (See 52 FR 2202, January 20, 1987). Another issue discussed by several commenters concerns the definition ofterms used in the regulations. Several respondents commented on the useof the term ``reasonable'' to describe transportation costs. One Statecommenter recommended that the term ``reasonable'' was too vague and shouldbe defined. Three industry commenters recommended that the term ``reasonable''be deleted. Six commenters were concerned about the term ``remote fromthe lease.'' Two Indian and two State respondents commented that the phrase``remote from the lease'' should be defined. Two industry commenters statedthat the phrase ``remote from the lease'' should be changed to ``the firstavailable market.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The term ``reasonable'' is defined by the Merriam-WebsterNew Collegiate Dictionary as ``moderate, fair.'' The MMS intends that thissame definition apply in the determination of a transportation allowanceand includes the requirement that the transportation costs be necessaryto market the oil. The MMS agrees that the phrase ``remote from the lease''caused confusion and has replaced it with the phrase ``off the lease.''The MMS received comments from a large number of respondents on andSection;206.104(b). This proposed regulation established a 50-percent limit ontransportation allowances. Most of the comments on this paragraph related to one major topic, thelimitation of 50 percent on oil transportation allowances. Comments werealso received on the proposal not to allow royalty payments to be reducedto zero. Comments on the 50-percent allowance issue were also divided betweenthose commenters who wanted to retain the limit and add additional qualifications,those who wanted to raise the limit, and those who wanted to lower thelimit.Most industry commenters stated that MMS should abolish the 50-percentlimitation for one or more of the following reasons: If the proposed limitis retained, the exception to the 50-percent limitation may not be exercisedfreely enough; the 50-percent limit could impose a serious economic deterrentto the exploration and development of frontier areas and could serve asa disincentive to the building of transportation systems; the limitationfigure is strictly arbitrary and totally unjust to the lessee/working interestowners; it would be a rare case when an oil transportation cost would comeclose to the proposed 50-percent cap, much less exceed it; the proposed50-percent cap is a deviation from the stated intent of MMS to base royaltyvaluation on ``gross proceeds.''Industry commenters stated that MMS should approve requests for transportationallowances exceeding the 50-percent limitation upon submission of adequatedocumentation by the lessee for the following reason: If the actual costof transportation can be reasonably justified, it should be permitted ifa lessee can adequately demonstrate that a higher allowance is in the bestinterest of the lessor.One Indian commenter stated MMS should change the 50-percent limitationto a 20-percent limitation because the 50-percent limit is excessivelyhigh.Industry and State commenters stated that MMS should clarify the exceptioncriteria which would allow transportation allowances to exceed the 50-percentlimitation. The proposed ``best interest of the lessor'' criteria was describedas vague and unclear and could be interpreted to exclude all cases. Criteriafor approval should allow a lessee to more objectively plan developmentof oil and gas prospects.Several industry respondents stated that MMS should allow lessees to carryforward transportation costs otherwise allowable (except for the 50-percentlimitation) from the current year to subsequent years. This procedure shouldbe applied to all transportation systems, but it would be especially importantin the frontier areas.A State, a State/Tribal association, and a few industry commenters statedthat MMS should retain the 50-percent limitation in the proposed regulationsfor the following reasons: The limit should apply in all cases with nodistinction made between circumstances where transportation is a componentof price and where transportation costs are incurred directly by the lessee;the 50-percent limit is acceptable as a guideline but MMS should freelyexercise its authority to allow transportation costs in excess of 50 percentof the value of the lease product; the 50-percent limitation provides incentiveto keep costs under control while allowing some relief for legitimate hardshipconditions.One industry respondent and one State commenter stated that royalty paymentsshould not be reduced to zero. The State respondent commented that it isa privilege to use public lands and it should not be possible to take productionfrom it royalty-free. Two industry respondents stated that royalty paymentsshould be allowed to go to zero for marginal production and for cases wherereservoir maintenance is a concern.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS has decided generally that the 50-percentlimitation should be retained in the final rule. The transportation allowancefor oil is limited to 50 percent of the value of the oil on the basis ofa selling arrangement. A lessee may request, and MMS may approve, a transportationallowance in excess of 50 percent if the lessee demonstrates that the costsincurred were reasonable, actual, and necessary. In no event, however,can the transportation allowance exceed 100 percent of the value of theoil.MMS received comments that a transportation allowance in excess of 50 percentshould be allowed only when it is in the ``best interests of the lessor.''MMS did not include this standard because it is too subjective. The requirementthat the costs be ``reasonable, actual, and necessary'' are sufficientto protect the lessor's interests.The MMS received several comments from industry on andSection; 206.104(c)which requires allocation of transportation costs among all products transported.One commenter stated that for transportation allowances, MMS should allocatecosts on the basis of relative value rather than on the basis of relativevolume. Two commenters recommended that costs associated with the transportationof nonroyalty-bearing products (i.e., water) should be deductible. It wasalso stated that to the extent transportation for certain nonroyalty-bearingproducts cannot be avoided, the costs should be equally as deductible asthe oil transportation. Four commenters recommended deleting the requirementthat transportation costs must be allocated among all products for oneor more of the following reasons: Allocation would be a labor-intensiveprocess and an onerous burden inflicted upon reporting parties; allocationwould be impractical because, in many instances, volumes are not available;and it would require significant additional effort to complete additionalForms MMS-4110.Other industry commenters recommended that allowances be granted for nonroyalty-bearingsubstances up to 30 percent of the volume of the transported stream.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS has considered the comments regarding allocatingcosts on the basis of relative value. The MMS does not agree with the proposalthat the costs of transporting nonroyalty-bearing substances should beincluded in a transportation allowance in all instances. However, uponreview, MMS has recognized that there could be circumstances where it isappropriate to provide an allowance which includes the costs of transportingcertain nonroyalty-bearing substances such as waste products, includingwater. For example, there may be circumstances where transportation ofwater along with the oil is necessary in order to transport the oil. Forother than waste products, the final rule provides, however, that priorMMS approval is required before an allowance may be taken for the costof transporting nonroyalty-bearing substances. The MMS is aware that the allocation of transportation costs in situationswhere more than one product is involved could be burdensome. However, itis MMS's experience that the allocation requirement would not be difficultin most instances. Section 206.105 Determination of transportation allowances. (a) <T3>Arm's-length transportation contracts.</T3>Although there were comments on a wide variety of subjects, they have beengrouped under nine issues as follows: Acceptance of FERC-approved tariffsand arm's-length transportation agreements, excessive penalty and retroactiveapprovals, MMS's approval of the transportation allowances, acceptanceof transportation reduced prices, status of currently approved allowances,required filing every 12 months, allowance on nonroyalty-bearing production,allocation of transportation costs, and period for filing a proposed allocationmethod.(1) Acceptance of FERC-approved tariffs and arm's-length transportationagreements as an accurate indicator of reasonable, actual costs.Several industry commenters responded that the oil transportation allowanceregulations should be written to support the use of FERC-approved tariffsand arm's-length transportation agreements as an accurate indicator ofreasonable, actual costs.Indian commenters expressed serious concern about the validity of usingarm's-length contracts as an indicator of value. One Indian commenter statedthat arm's-length contracts are not a bona fide indicator of reasonable,actual costs. Another Indian commenter expressed doubt that there can evenbe an arm's-length contract between companies in the oil industry. OneIndian commenter stated that arm's-length contracts should not be acceptedunless a thorough analysis of lessee/purchaser affiliations is undertaken.Another Indian respondent expressed considerable doubt that the criteriaused by MMS would assure that an arm's-length contract is present in anygiven case. An Indian commenter also stated that MMS should establish appropriatecriteria to determine the accuracy and reasonableness of allowances grantedunder arm's-length and non-arm's-length contract situations. <T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS currently uses FERC-approved tariffs andarm's-length transportation agreements as an accurate indicator of reasonable,actual costs. In these final rules, for non-arm's-length and no-contractsituations, MMS generally will permit only the reasonable, actual expensesincurred by the lessee as the allowance. For lessees who have tariffs approvedby FERC or a State regulatory agency, MMS is creating an exception to thispolicy, discussed below in regard to andSection; 206.105(b). MMS has addeda sentence to andSection; 206.105(a)(1) clarifying that the lessee has theburden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length.MMS also has added two new paragraphs to address situations where a contract,though arm's-length, should be treated as non-arm's-length pursuant toandSection; 206.105(b). The first situation is where MMS determines thatthe transportation contract reflects more than the consideration transferredfrom the lessee to the transporter for the transportation; i.e., the transportationcost has been inflated. The second situation is where the MMS determinesthat there has been misconduct by or between the contracting parties, orthe lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to market theproduction for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor. The typesof misconduct or breach of duty which would trigger application of theseprovisions are essentially the same as those discussed above in the valuationsection.(2) The disallowance of a transportation deduction for a reporting periodnot covered by a Form MMS-4110, Oil Transportation Allowance Report.The MMS received responses from several industry respondents stating thatthe disallowance of a transportation deduction for a reporting period notcovered by a Form MMS-4110 is an excessive penalty for what they considerto be a minor infraction of the rules. The point was also made that thelessee does not always have the data to timely file a Form MMS-4110 beforethe Form MMS-2014 is filed. However, one State commenter agreed with theproposed regulation disallowing the deduction for any period in which theForm MMS-4110 was not received.Many industry commenters responded on this paragraph stating that the regulationsshould have a provision allowing retroactive transportation deductions.The general consensus was that a lessee does not always have the detailson transportation worked out before production begins, and sometimes itis necessary to go back and revise data related to an allowance after agreementsare reached because of the fast changing nature of current oil and gasmarkets.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS considered the comments on retroactive requestsand has revised the regulations, andSection; 206.105 (a)(1) and (b)(1), toallow lessees to request transportation allowances retroactively for aperiod of not more than 3 months. Pursuant to andSection; 206.105(d), ifa lessee takes a deduction without complying with the regulations, interestonly must be paid until the date that appropriate forms are filed. However,the lessee will be required to repay the amount of any deduction disallowedowing to the limitation on retroactivity.(3) Prior MMS approval of transportation allowances.Industry respondents expressed approval of the self-implementing procedurein the transportation allowance regulations. This was regarded as a methodof relieving a considerable administrative burden on both industry andMMS. One Indian commenter disagreed with the self-implementing nature ofthe regulations because it was regarded as a method of establishing the50-percent limitation as a floor for transportation allowances.State and Indian commenters stated that MMS should pre-approve all transportationallowances and should provide approval only on a showing of necessity topromote development or a showing that a higher value could be obtainedfor the oil at a point of sale away from the lease. It was also statedthat neither the MMS nor the States and Indian Tribes have the resourcesto audit all leases and if these allowances are not monitored ``up front''they will never be audited.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS has determined that it is not necessaryto preapprove all transportation allowances. The MMS will monitor and reviewtransportation allowances for regulatory compliance and reasonableness.Therefore, most allowances under andSection; 206.105(a) and (b) do not requireprior MMS approval.(4) Acceptance of transportation-reduced prices without requiring the filingof Form MMS-4110 for both arm's-length and non-arm's-length situations.Industry commenters responded that MMS should accept transportation-reducedprices without requiring the filing of Form MMS-4110 for both arm's-lengthand non-arm's-length situations. This policy was regarded as reducing theadministrative burden on industry and MMS. However, one commenter disagreedwith this proposal because it was regarded as a potential technique toexceed the 50-percent limitation provision of the regulation. One commenterstated that neither industry nor MMS could administer trucking-rate transportationallowances on the basis of lease-by-lease and, therefore, MMS will probablybe forced to accept transportation-reduced values where trucking is involved.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS considered these comments and determinedthat andSection; 206.105(a)(5) of the final rule should provide that transportationfactors specified in arm's-length contracts are to be considered as reductionsin value rather than transportation allowances. The use of Form MMS-4110for the transportation factors is not required. However, so as not to providea means of avoiding the 50-percent limit on transportation allowances,the final rules provide that the transportation factor may not exceed 50percent of the base price of the product without MMS approval.(5) Should current approved transportation allowances remain in effectuntil they expire?Two industry commenters responded that it would be administratively easierif the regulations would allow a current approved transportation allowanceto remain in effect until it expires. Seven industry commenters statedthat the transportation allowance reported on Form MMS-4110 should continueuntil the applicable contract or rate terminates or is modified or amended.State commenters stated that, owing to some allowances currently beingtaken without written MMS approval, only those lessees with documentedapproval should be allowed to continue without submission of the Form MMS-4110.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS considered these comments and has revisedthe regulations at andSection; 206.105(c)(1)(v) and (c)(2)(v) to providethat transportation allowances in effect on the date these regulationsbecome effective will be allowed to continue until they terminate, subjectto audit. However, MMS is limiting this provision only to those allowancesthat have written approval from MMS. Because the regulations are beingrevised to remove any prior approval by MMS before a deduction can be taken,and the submission of Form MMS-4110 is to increase MMS's ability to monitorthe allowances being taken, MMS believes that the intent of the final ruleswill be best served by requiring all allowances to be deducted under thenew rules documented as of the effective date.(6) Should MMS require the filing of Form MMS-4110 every 12 months?Industry commenters stated that there is no benefit to MMS in submittinga form that duplicates information on file when a change has not occurred.Two industry commenters responded that there is no apparent reason forMMS requiring the filing of Form MMS-4110 every 12 months. <T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS requires the annual filing of Form MMS-4110for use in monitoring costs and volumes associated with a multi-milliondollar transportation allowance program. The regulation is being adoptedas proposed.(7) Should MMS allow transportation allowances for production which isnot royalty bearing?An industry commenter recommended that a transportation allowance shouldinclude costs associated with moving water because some water is retainedin pipeline oil. Another industry respondent recommended deletion of thelast sentences of andSection; 206.105(a)(2) and (b)(3) which prohibit disallowancesfor transporting lease production which is not royalty-bearing.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> As discussed earlier, MMS has decided that it isappropriate to provide an allowance which includes the costs of transportingcertain production, including waste products, which is not royalty bearing.(8) Allocation of a cost applicable to more than one product.Two industry commenters stated that allocation of costs presents a burdensomeadministrative task, but if allocation of costs is deemed necessary, itshould be allocated on the basis of relative value rather than on the basisof relative volume. One industry commenter suggested that MMS provide analternative allocation procedure for situations which would require a variancefrom the proposed allocation method.One State commenter suggested that MMS provide guidance on what will bean acceptable method of allocation in situations that involve the transportationof both gaseous and liquid products. One industry commenter suggested thatthe rules could be further enhanced by allowing for the adoption of anallocation procedure contained in a different arm's-length transportationcontract where similar conditions and products exist.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS has added a new paragraph which providesthat, upon request of the lessee, MMS will approve the allocation of costson the basis of the values of the products transported unless such allocationmethod is not consistent with the purposes of the regulations in Part 206.It would be difficult for MMS to provide guidance on acceptable methodsof allocation because of the many different situations involving the transportationof both gaseous and liquid products. The MMS believes that the most advantageousprocedure is to have the lessee submit an allocation proposal to MMS inthese situations. Thus, andSection; 206.105(a)(3) and (b)(4) require thelessee to submit such an allocation proposal within prescribed timeframes.(9) The MMS should extend the period to submit a proposed allocation method.Two commenters stated that the requirement to submit a proposed allocationmethod within 60 days will create a significant workload and burden, anda more reasonable provision of time would be 120 days. Others requestedan even longer period.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS determined that 3 months is a reasonabletime period to submit a proposed allocation method and andSection; 206.105(a)(3)and (b)(4) have been revised accordingly.(b) <T3>Non-arm's length or no contract. </T3> The MMS received many comments on andSection; 206.105(b), which applies tonon-arm's-length or no-contract transportation situations, from industry,industry trade groups, States, Indian Tribes, and a Federal agency. Mostof the negative comments actually addressed andSection; 206.104(a), and thosecomments generally expressed the belief that no transportation allowanceof any kind should be granted by MMS.The comments received on these paragraphs have been grouped into nine issuesas follows: Acceptance of State or FERC tariffs, acceptance of comparablearm's-length contracts, use of a benchmark system, penalties, increasein estimated allowances, prior approval of allowances, allowable costs,rate of return, and retaining Alternatives 1 and 2 for return on capital.(1) Should MMS accept published State or FERC tariffs instead of usingactual costs as the basis for approving transportation allowances? Industry commenters stated that MMS should accept published State or FERCtariffs as the transportation allowance in non-arm's-length and no-contractsituations. These commenters believed that MMS should ``rightfully relyon the expertise of FERC and State agencies which set pipeline tariffsto determine fair and reasonable transportation charges.'' It was alsostated that if MMS does not rely on FERC and/or State tariffs, there wouldbe a wasteful duplication of effort between FERC, State agencies, and MMS.One industry commenter stated that FERC tariffs should be accepted as anallowable deduction regardless of whether the transportation contract isarm's-length or non-arm's-length because the tariff represents the recognizedvalue of the service.One industry commenter stated that MMS should accept as a transportationallowance either a FERC tariff or the actual cost including a reasonableprofit, whichever is higher. This would give the lessee an option thatwould be more fair than the single method prescribed by MMS.Two industry commenters stated that MMS should require actual costs onlywhen there was no pipeline or published tariff. The use of internal costaccounting to determine the value of a transportation allowance was believedto be at odds with the interests of the lessee.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> After careful consideration, MMS has decided that,generally, for non-arm's-length or no-contract situations, the fairestand best way to determine transportation allowances is to allow actual,reasonable costs plus, if appropriate, an acceptable cost for the lessee'sundepreciated capital equipment. However, MMS has concluded that wherea lessee has a tariff approved by FERC or a State agency, it is unnecessarilyburdensome and duplicative to recompute costs. Therefore, MMS will recognizeFERC tariffs (for both Federal and Indian leases) and tariffs approvedby a State regulatory agency (for Federal leases) as a valid cost in computinga transportation allowance when it is an actual out-of-pocket expense pursuantto an arm's-length transportation contract. Existence of such tariffs fora transportation system also will authorize MMS to grant an exception tothe requirement to use actual costs for non-arm's-length or nocontractsituations. See discussion below.(2) Should MMS accept comparable arm's-length contracts for determiningtransportation allowances?Several industry respondents stated that MMS should accept comparable arm's-lengthcontract costs as the transportation allowance. The costs incurred undercomparable arm's-length contracts were described as the best indicatorof the value of that service provided by the lessee in transporting oilto a market or to any other point where it could be sold.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> It is MMS's past and present practice generallyto allow only those costs which are directly related to the transportationof lease production. Costs incurred under ``comparable arm's-length contracts''may include costs such as Federal and State income taxes, or socioeconomiccosts incurred by the lessee in order to obtain State or county land accesssuch as the construction of schools or city sewer facilities. The MMS consideredthese comments in revising the regulations and decided that it was in thebest interests of the Government, States, and Indians to base oil transportationallowances on actual, reasonable costs plus return on investment. However, in an effort to simplify procedures for both the lessee and MMS,the regulations at andSection; 206.105(b)(5) will provide an exception tothe requirement to compute actual costs where the lessor's interest isadequately protected. The lessee must apply to MMS for the exception, andMMS will grant the exception only if the lessee has a tariff for the systemapproved by FERC (for both Federal and Indian leases) or a State regulatoryagency (for Federal leases). However, the rules contain protection fromunreasonably high tariffs. The MMS will deny the exception request if itdetermines that the tariff is excessive as compared to arm's-length transportationcharges by pipelines, owned by the lessee or others, providing similartransportation services in that area. If there are no such arm's-lengthtransportation charges to use for comparison, MMS will deny the exceptionrequest if no FERC or State regulatory analysis exists and the FERC orState regulatory agency has declined to investigate pursuant to MMS's timelyobjections upon filing, and the tariff significantly exceeds the lessee'sactual costs for transportation as determined under the regulations insubsection (b)(2). (3) Should the transportation allowance be based on the market value oftransportation service as determined under a benchmark system?Many industry respondents stated that MMS should allow transportation deductionsbased on a benchmark system. These commenters suggested that MMS allowthe lessee the market value of the transportation service on the basisof a benchmark system featuring arm's-length contracts and tariffs withcost accounting being used only as a last resort.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS considered the benchmark valuation systemfeaturing arm's-length contracts and FERC tariffs with cost accountingbeing used as a last resort. The MMS has not adopted this recommendationfor the same reasons as cited in issue no. 2 above. (4) Should a penalty be imposed for late submission of the Form MMS-4110?An industry respondent commented that requiring lessees to file Forms MMS-4110and MMS-2014 at the same time would impose an unfair penalty on lesseesfor being unable to complete Form MMS-4110 prior to the Form MMS-2014 reportingdeadline and that there is no need to cancel all currently approved allowances.Two other industry commenters suggested that submittal of Form MMS-4110be only on the basis of as-needed, pursuant to contract changes.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS has reconsidered the reporting requirementthat would deny the transportation allowance for those periods for whichno Form MMS-4110 was filed. Pursuant to andSection; 206.105(b)(1) of thefinal rules, a lessee may claim a transportation allowance retroactivelyfor a period of 3 months from the first day of the month that the FormMMS-4110 is filed. However, if the lessee has taken an allowance beforefiling the form, it must pay interest from the date the allowance was takenuntil the form is filed. The lessee will also be required to repay theamount of any allowance which is disallowed owing to the 3-month limitationon retroactivity. See andSection; 206.105(d). The proposal to retain allcurrent allowances in effect until they expire was considered and it wasdecided that approved allowances (i.e., allowances approved in writingby MMS) in effect on the effective date of these rules will be allowedto continue in effect until they expire. See andSection;andSection; 206.105(c)(1)(v)and 206.105(c)(2)(v).(5) Should the estimated rate reported on Form MMS-4110 be allowed to increaseover the prior period, if justified?One industry commenter requested that the estimated rate be allowed toincrease over the prior period, if justified. This respondent also recommendedthat the initial allowance be effective for a period greater or lesserthan the 12 months to allow industry to convert to calendar year reporting.This would ease the administrative burden. Another industry commenter questionedthe cost effectiveness of the two-step submission of estimates and corrections.This commenter recommended that any adjustment, plus or minus, be madeprospectively only.<T3>MMS Response</T3>: The recommendation to allow an estimated rate toincrease over the actual rate for the prior period, if justified, has beenaddressed in the final regulations. Pursuant to andSection; 206.105(c)(2)(iii),the lessee may use an estimate higher or lower than the previous year'sactual rate if the lessee believes it is appropriate when submitting FormMMS-4110. The recommendation to adjust the initial reporting period toallow industry to convert to calendar year reporting has been consideredand the regulations at andSection; 260.105(c) have been revised to providefor calendar-year reporting.(6) Should MMS require prior approval for allowances?Industry respondents commented that they were in support of the self-implementingfeature of the regulations which would not require prior approval of eachallowance by MMS before the allowance could be claimed. Two State commentersproposed that MMS should require prior approval on non-arm's-length contractor no-contract deductions for transportation because adequate audit resourcesare not available to audit the allowances, and it is very likely that manyleases will never be audited. One Indian commenter proposed that MMS requireprior approval and audit to prevent abuse in the claiming of depreciationand overhead costs.<T3>MMS Response:</T3> The MMS currently reviews and approves all transportationallowance requests and has considered pre-approval and pre-audit of transportationallowances. It has been decided that a more effective use of resourcescan be attained by doing exception processing on allowances and selectivelyreviewing certain allowances in depth to determine the propriety of theallowance reported by lessees on Form MMS-4110. Therefore, with limitedexceptions, no prior approval of allowances will be required.(7) Should costs other than reasonable actual costs be considered in calculatingthe transportation allowance?A few industry respondents stated that MMS should revise the regulationsto make an allowance for debt service and State and Federal income taxes.Three industry commenters recommended that MMS provide for a complete recoveryof costs plus an acceptable profit for assuming the risks involved in undertakingthe service function of transportation. One industry commenter recommendedthat MMS allow for administrative overhead beyond that which is directlyassociated with, or attributable to, the transportation system.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2/><T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS views income taxes to be an apportionmentof profit rather than a valid operating expense. However, interest on moneyborrowed for operations would be considered as a valid operating expense.Interest on money borrowed to build a transportation facility is not consideredallowable. A return on investment is given in lieu of interest on capitalinvestments. The proposal to extend the amount of overhead beyond thatwhich is directly allocable or attributable to transportation is not acceptable.Administrative overhead or any other costs not directly associated withtransportation are not allowed.(8) What rate of return should be used to calculate return on depreciableinvestment?Most industry respondents opposed the use of Moody's Aaa corporate bondrate as unrealistic and too low. One industry commenter stated that ``Thereis no reason to equate pipeline risks with the highest rated, most securedebt rate.'' Two industry commenters stated that the proposed rate is veryconservative and arbitrary and the general consensus of the parties wasthat the rate of return should be adequate to reflect the risks involvedin the oil and gas business. Seven respondents stated that the Aaa rateis the absolute lowest borrowing rate available only to a few ``blue chip''companies.One industry respondent suggested four alternatives to Moody's Aaa bondrate: (1) Prime rate plus 5 percent; (2) one and one-half times the average20-year treasury bill rate; (3) 150 percent of Moody's Aaa rate; or (4)the rate of return methodology adopted by FERC in Opinion No. 154-B. Thisindustry commenter also stated that industry's position supports a rateof return plus additional points to reflect risk factors, and two otherindustry commenters suggested that the rate of return should include Federalincome tax. Several industry respondents recommended a rate of return based upon thecost of debt and equity financing. One party stated that ``Assets are notfinanced by debt alone; equity financing must be included in the calculationof an actual and reasonable cost of capital * * *'' and suggested a rateto account for equity financing and an alternative method for extraordinarycircumstances based on the weighted-average cost of capital. Another industrycommenter suggested that the proposed rate ``* * * would not include anyreturn on equity which is a significant portion of the capitalization ofthe pipeline.'' One industry commenter suggested ``* * * a true rate ofreturn for the risk involved and the cost of capital for both debt andequity.'' Another respondent suggested a rate based on ``* * * both costof credit and equity capital.'' One industry respondent stated that ``Mostfirms receive funds from both debt and equity sources.''Two industry commenters proposed the prime rate plus 5 percent in accordancewith the RMAC panel. Two industry respondents suggested the average 20-yearTreasury Bill rate times 150 percent. Seven industry commenters recommendedeither the average 20-year Treasury Bill rate times 150 percent or theprime rate plus 5 percent as proposed by the Oil Valuation and Gas ValuationPanels, respectively. One industry respondent recommended the prime rateplus 7 percent. Another industry respondent suggested Moody's 20-year Baarate plus 9 percent as an equitable rate of return. One industry commenterpreferred the Treasury Bill rate times 150 percent if MMS fixes the rateat the time of initial investment, or the prime rate plus 5 percent ifMMS redetermines the rate yearly. Another industry respondent suggesteda 23-percent pre-tax rate of return. One industry commenter suggested thata risk component of from 5 to 7 points above the Aaa rate be adopted. Two industry commenters stated that the limitation on the rate of returnserves as an economic disincentive for lessees to invest in high-risk ventures,such as the frontier areas. Three industry respondents commented that alessee affiliated with the pipeline would be at a disadvantage under theproposed rate of return because it would not be competitive with otherproducers deducting a transportation allowance that includes risk factors.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS has examined several options relating torate of return and decided that a rate of return should be closely associatedwith the cost of money necessary to construct transportation facilities.The MMS has examined the use of the corporate bond rate very carefullyand has concluded that such rates are representative of the loan rateson sums of money comparable to that expected for the construction of transportationfacilities. There is no doubt that there are some very high risks involved with someoil and gas ventures, such as wildcat drilling. However, the risk associatedwith building and developing a pipeline to move oil that has already beendiscovered is a much different risk. The risk of default (financial risk)is considered in corporate bond rates. Considering the risks related totransportation systems, a rate of return that is based on an applicablecorporate bond rate would be appropriate for transportation systems.The MMS has considered the prime rate, the prime rate plus 5 points, oneand one-half times the average 20-year Treasury Bill rate, the Moody'sbond rate, and Standard and Poor's bond rate.The MMS believes that the use of an appropriate rate of return based onthe corporate bond rate adequately considers the risk associated with atransportation system and that there is no rational basis for increasinga rate of return by arbitrarily adding percentage points simply to increasethe allowance granted to a lessee. After carefully considering the commentsand the options available, MMS determined that the rate of return shouldbe based on Standard and Poor's BBB industrial bond rate. Section 206.105(b)(2)(v)has been revised accordingly in the final rule. However, because of thesubstantial and diverse comments on this issue, including several commentson the draft final rule that the BBB bond rate is not much better thanthe first proposal, MMS will issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to reconsiderthe applicable rate of return for purposes of these regulations. The MMS does not consider State and Federal income taxes as an appropriateexpense that should be included in a transportation allowance and doesnot agree that the rate of return should be increased to allow for incometax liability.(9) Should MMS retain the provisions of both Alternative 1 and Alternative2?Some industry respondents commented that MMS should retain both Alternative1 and Alternative 2 in proposed andSection; 206.105(b)(5)(iv). One industrycommenter recommended that both Alternatives 1 and 2 be included in anycost-based methodology for determination of a transportation allowance.Another industry commenter recommended that both alternatives be made availablefor use at the lessee's election on the basis of an individual transportationarrangement because adoption of this approach would assure the flexibilitynecessary to adapt to unforeseen changes in the business and transportationenvironments. Two industry respondents stated that MMS should retain Alternative1. One industry commenter stated that it endorsed use of the first alternativebecause it gives lessees some latitude in choosing the depreciation method.One industry respondent commented that MMS should not retain Alternative2. The commenter stated that this alternative would encourage third partiesto become involved in the pipeline business, in which case MMS would absorbthe full market cost of transportation provided.Several industry respondents commented that MMS should adopt Alternative2 and apply it to all existing and future transportation facilities. Onecommenter stated that limiting Alternative 2 (return on initial capitalinvestment) to new or newly acquired transportation systems is unsupportedin the proposed rules and Alternative 2 should be available without thelimitation imposed by the MMS. Two industry commenters stated that theypresumed Alternative 2 has no limit on the deduction under this alternative.Both industry commenters stated that although Alternative 1 specificallystates that a transportation system may be depreciated only once, thereis no mention of such a cap on Alternative 2 and, therefore, it is presumedthat this option has no limit. One industry commenter stated that it believedit was appropriate to include both Alternative 1 and Alternative 2 in anycost-based methodology for determination of a transportation allowance.One industry respondent recommended that MMS permit the depreciation scheduleto be adjusted to reflect additional capital investment of a subsequentpurchaser because, if additional capital is invested, there is no doublerecoupment of capital investment.Several industry commenters stated that MMS's proposal to disallow recapitalizationis inequitable. One commenter stated that because this proposal would onlyrecognize the original capital costs, the additional capital costs whichmay have been invested by the new owner may not be recovered.Some industry respondents stated that, although they agreed with the conceptof allowing a rate of return on the transportation facilities, the applicationof the allowance is unfair insofar as a company using Alternative 1 (i.e.,one with existing facilities) would only be receiving a return on investmentfor the undepreciated investment (or net book value).Some industry respondents stated that MMS should not tie the rate of returnto a diminishing value. Both commenters stated that because the intentionis to provide the lessee with a rate of return for his invested capitalhe should not be penalized by a diminishing return caused by tying thereturn into a depreciation option.Several industry commenters stated that MMS should allow a lessee to addestimated abandonment costs to its depreciable capital investment value.One industry commenter stated that, although MMS has set out that the proposedregulations require recognition of salvage values, often the cost of abandonmentexceeds any salvage value; consequently, it was suggested that the estimatedcost of abandonment of the transportation system be included as an expenseof operation to the lessee.An industry commenter stated that a transportation system should be depreciatedonly once. The commenter suggested that the regulation state ``A changein ownership of a transportation system shall not alter the depreciationschedule established by the original transporter/lessee for purposes ofthe allowance calculation. With or without a change in ownership, a transportationsystem shall be depreciated only once.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS has reviewed the comments received regardingboth Alternative 1 and Alternative 2 in proposed andSection; 206.105(b)(5)(iv)and concluded that both alternatives should be retained. However, underthe final rule, andSection; 206.105(b)(2)(iv), Alternative 2 can only beused for transportation facilities first placed in service after the effectivedate of these regulations.The MMS has considered the issue of recapitalization and decided that itwas appropriate for the Government to pay its share for the depreciationof a system transporting royalty-bearing oil only once.The MMS has carefully considered the issue of basing the rate of returnon a diminishing value and has decided that this procedure is consistentwith longstanding Government policy on allowances and that MMS should continuethis policy for transportation facilities in operation on the effectivedate of these regulations.The MMS has taken the position that, because it does not participate inthe profit or losses that could result from the sale of transportationfacilities, no costs for dismantling and abandonment should be includedin transportation allowances.The final rules provide that a transportation system may be depreciatedonly once, and that the depreciation schedule established by the originaltransporter/lessee may not be altered by a change in ownership.(c) <T3>Reporting requirements.</T3>The MMS received many comments from industry and Indians on the reportingrequirements, andSection; 206.105(c), in addition to the comments alreadydiscussed above. The two major issues of concern relating to the reportingrequirements were (1) usage of Form MMS-4110, and (2) the terms of theallowance and reporting periods.(1) Should MMS require the filing of Form MMS-4110?Several industry and Indian commenters opposed the use of Form MMS-4110.One Indian commenter stated that there should be more monitoring of deductionstaken from royalty and requested that MMS retain an approval process insteadof the mere filing of Form MMS-4110. One industry commenter stated thatForm MMS-2014 will show the transportation allowance taken and that FormMMS-4110 is unnecessary. Two industry commenters recommended the filingof an ``Intent to Deduct Transportation.'' One industry commenter statedthat the transportation costs under arm's-length contracts should be partof the value and Form MMS-4110 should be filed only for non-arm's-lengthtransportation.Many industry commenters stated that it would be burdensome to file a newForm MMS-4110 each time a trucking charge or similar net change occurredin a contract price. One industry commenter stated that price postingshave been amended as often as three times per month. One industry commentersuggested that Addendum No. 15 be incorporated into the new regulationsand expanded to include offshore leases. One industry commenter statedthat the regulations are not clear about whether or not a Form MMS-4110must be filed for prices net of transportation. This industry commenteralso stated that in some situations the lessee may not know a price isbeing netted of transportation in time to file Form MMS-4110.One Indian commenter stated that the information on Form MMS-4110 shouldbe clear and uncomplicated and should be available to the Indians.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS believes that Form MMS-4110 must be requiredin order for MMS to monitor the transportation allowance program. The MMSbelieves it can monitor the transportation allowance deductions more effectivelythan with the pre-approval of the allowances. The MMS has made the informationon Form MMS-4110 as clear and uncomplicated as possible considering thecomplex nature of transportation allowances. The information on these formswill be made available to the Indians upon proper request. The filing ofa Form MMS-4110 equates to an ``intent to deduct transportation.'' Thetransportation costs under an arm's-length contract are separate from thevalue determination under such a contract so a Form MMS-4110 should befiled for transportation costs determined under both arm's-length and non-arm's-lengthcontracts.In arm's-length situations where the purchaser is reducing the posted pricefor a transportation cost and the lessee is incurring no out-of-pocketexpense, filing a Form MMS-4110 is unnecessary. In these situations, thepoint of sale is at the point the purchaser acquires the oil and, becausethe reduction in price represents a cost incurred past the point of firstsale, a transportation allowance would not be allowed by the regulations.However, in determining the value of the oil, the reduction of price forthe transportation costs past the point of sale would be considered. Section206.105(a)(5) of the final rule incorporates the necessary regulatory language.(2) Term of the allowance periods and the timetable for reporting.One industry commenter endorsed the 12-month term for both onshore andoffshore leases. Another industry commenter strongly suggested that alltransportation allowances based on cost accounting be determined on thebasis of calendar-year reporting. This industry respondent also suggestedthat all existing transportation allowances based on cost accounting beextended until April 1, 1988, when data for the 1987 allowance would besubmitted.Other industry commenters opposed the termination of all current allowancesand recommended continuing allowances in effect for a period of time beyondthe effective date of the regulations to allow for smooth transition. Thegeneral consensus was that it would be an administrative burden to requirethe filing of Form MMS-4110 immediately upon passage of the rulemaking.In addition, two of these four industry respondents proposed that the transportationallowances remain in effect for an additional 90 days beyond the issuancedate of the regulations. One of these commenters suggested filing new formsonly when the current allowance expires.One industry commenter recommended a grace period for filing all allowances.Another industry commenter proposed a 90-day filing period for new FormsMMS-4110 that are submitted for contract revisions.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS concurs with a 12-month term and the finalregulations, in andSection; 206.105(c), have been changed to provide thata Form MMS-4110 will be filed by calendar year. The MMS considered extendingcurrent allowances and andSection; 206.105 (c)(1)(v) and (c)(2)(v) now providethat certain allowances will continue in effect until they expire. Theseare limited to allowances approved in writing by MMS. In regard to a graceperiod for filing, the regulations have been revised to allow a grace periodof 3 months for all non-arm's-length and no-contract situations. The regulationsin andSection; 206.105(c)(2)(iii) allow the lessee 3 months after the endof the previous reporting period to file the Form MMS-4110, during whichperiod the lessee will continue to use its previous allowance. Also, thefinal regulations at andSection; 206.105 (a)(1) and (b)(1) have been revisedto allow for transportation allowances to be claimed retroactively fora period of not more than 3 months prior to the first day of the monththat Form MMS-4110 is filed with MMS. Therefore, even if the lessee isnot able to file the Form MMS-4110 timely, the lessee could file the FormMMS-4110 and claim the transportation allowance on a corrected Form MMS-2014at a later date. The rules also have been modified to include in paragraphs(c)(i)(vi) and (c)(2)(vii) a provision to allow MMS to establish reportingrequirements different from those specified in the rules where circumstanceswarrant.The MMS has received some comments on the Form MMS-4110. Those commentswill be considered in revising the final forms.(d) <T3>Adjustments.</T3>Several industry respondents commented on andSection; 206.105(e), which wasproposed as andSection; 206.105(d), and pertains to adjustments. Four principalissues were identified.(1) Should MMS require retroactive adjustments to transportation allowances?It was the general consensus in the comments that adjustments were a verylarge burden on both industry and the MMS and that some way should be foundto eliminate the need for the many adjustments that result from differencesbetween actual and estimated transportation allowances. Six industry commentersrecommended that positive or negative differences between estimated andactual costs should be rolled forward into the transportation rate forthe subsequent period because this would greatly relieve the administrativeburden on MMS and industry. Three industry commenters recommended thatactual data from one period be used as the allowance for the subsequentperiod, eliminating the need for adjustments. It was stated also that thisprocedure would relieve the burden on MMS and industry associated withthe requirement to make adjustments to each account, each month, for eachyear.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>To ease the burden resulting from the adjustmentsrequirement, MMS has eliminated the need for many retroactive adjustmentsby accepting arm's-length-contract transportation costs when the lesseetimely files the Form MMS-4110. For non-arm's-length and no-contract situations,MMS did not eliminate the need for adjustments between actual and estimatedtransportation allowances. The MMS considered alternatives such as (1)rolling forward differences into subsequent periods, or (2) using actualdata from one period to be used as the next period's actual allowance,but determined that either procedure could be inequitable to lessees, MMS,Indian Tribes, and Indian allottees. However, because many lessees nowwill be able to use FERC tariffs for non-arm's-length transportation allowances,retroactive adjustments will be further reduced.(2) Should MMS require refunds to be requested under the refund procedurerequirement of section 10 of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act?An industry commenter stated that refunds for estimates tendered in excessof actual costs should not be judged as refunds of a payment of royaltyunder section 10 of the OCS Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1339, because estimatesare not ``actual'' payments of royalty. Overpayments could then be treatedas line-item adjustments not subject to the refund process. Two industryrespondents emphasized that the requirement to submit written requestsfor refunds for under-deducted transportation costs in accordance withsection 10 of the OCS Lands Act will be an extraordinarily difficult financialand reporting burden to industry and MMS. Two industry commenters statedthat the current long review and audit process is now causing lessees tolose the time value of money in the refunds which are due the lessees undersection 10 of the OCS Lands Act. Audits on such refunds were describedas fruitless and wasteful and the suggestion was made that MMS should considertransportation allowance adjustments to be exceptions to the refund requirementsof Section 10 of the OCS Lands Act. Overpayments would be recovered throughline-item adjustments on Form MMS-2014.Two industry commenters suggested that the submission of Form MMS-4110should constitute the tolling of the 2-year statute of limitations perioddefined in section 10 of the OCS Lands Act. These parties believed thatthis should be put in the regulations to avoid burdensome refund procedures.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>It would not be proper for these rules to prescribethe refund procedures. MMS is examining the issue and will provide guidanceto lessees.(3) Payment of interest. Industry commenters stated that the MMS-proposed procedure for handlinginterest payments was not fair. These commenters believed that, if thelessee must pay any difference plus interest, MMS should also pay any differenceplus any interest statutorily authorized.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>MMS has no legal authority to pay interest.(f) <T3>Actual or theoretical losses.</T3>The MMS received over 15 industry comments on andSection; 206.105(f), whichwas proposed as andSection; 206.105(e). All commenters basically stated thatMMS should amend or delete this paragraph to allow actual or theoreticallosses as a transportation cost.Nine industry respondents stated that line losses are actual transportationcosts which should be allowed by MMS. The basic premise of these commentswas that all costs resulting from line losses should be deductible because,if MMS does not absorb its pro rata share of such transportation costs,an inequity results.As a variation of this issue, eight industry commenters declared that onlycertain oil losses should be deductible from royalty. Other industry respondentscommented that line losses in arm's-length contracts and FERC tariffs shouldbe allowed. One of these commenters stated that, if a loss provision isa part of an arm's-length contract or a FERC tariff, MMS should acceptsuch a provision, just as it accepts the dollars-and-cents rates in thecontract or tariff. In other words, the losses are part of the total costof the transportation arrangement and should be deductible. Three industrycommenters stated that MMS should allow those line losses not attributableto negligence. One of these commenters stated that a credit should be allowedfor line losses not attributable to negligence and such change would conformto Section 308 of the FOGRMA, which specifies that a lessee is liable forroyalty payments on oil and gas lost or wasted from a lease site when suchloss or waste is because of negligence on the part of the operator of thelease.One industry commenter stated that producer-owned pipelines should includetransportation losses as part of operating expenses in the formulationof an allowance.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>All of the issues of theoretical and actual linelosses have been considered at length by MMS. The MMS will include, aspart of a transportation allowance under an arm's-length contract, amountsrequired to be paid in cash or in-kind for line losses. However, becauseof the difficulty of demonstrating that losses are valid and not the resultof meter error or other difficult-to-measure causes, MMS has decided notto treat line losses as valid costs for purposes of computing transportationallowances in non-arm's-length or no-contract situations. However, if anytariff approved by FERC or a State regulatory agency is authorized to beused for a non-arm's-length transportation allowance situation, any componentof that tariff for actual or theoretical losses will be allowed.(g) <T3>Other transportation cost determinations.</T3>Only a few comments were received on andSection; 206.105(g), which was proposedas andSection; 206.105(f). This section allows use of the transportationallowance rules where transportation is a component of a valuation proceduresuch as a net-back.The major concern raised about this paragraph was the application of thetransportation allowance regulations to a net-back valuation. Two industrycommenters stated that the use of restrictive cost-based transportationallowances is inequitable when the net-back valuation procedure is usedand recommended that the section be reworded to recognize total ``actualcosts'' incurred to move or improve the hydrocarbon for sale downstream.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS has reviewed and analyzed the comments relatingto the procedure for netting costs back to the lease to determine a valuefor royalty purposes. The MMS remains convinced that the cost-based allowanceprocedure for determining oil transportation allowances is appropriatefor determining value under a netback procedure. If there is an applicableFERC tariff, upon application by the lessee, that could be used instead.Section 207.5 Contract and sales agreement retention.Two comments were received regarding andSection; 207.5 (formerly proposedas andSection; 207.4), one from industry and one from a State. The Statecommenter suggested several modifications to clarify and insure that sufficientdocumentation on oil sales is maintained and made available to FOGRMA-authorizedState auditors and other authorized personnel. The industry commenter suggested that the regulations should limit theaudit period, and thus the time for record retention, to six years. Thiswould avoid ``an unnecessary administrative burden'' upon industry to maintainrecords for an indefinite period.<T3>MMS Response: </T3>The MMS has modified the final rule to require lesseesto maintain and make available all documents relevant to the valuationof production.This subpart is not the appropriate place to address record retention requirements.The record retention provisions are found at andSection; 212.51 (a) and (b).Section 3162.7-4 Royalty rates on oil; sliding and step-scale leases (publicland only).This section was proposed as andSection; 202.101. The Bureau of Land Management(BLM) advised that ``the redesignation into 43 CFR must be accomplishedprior to finalization of the proposed MMS regulations under 30 CFR Part202 because the well count regulations (43 CFR Part 3100) must be referencedin the new 30 CFR Part 202.'' The BLM recommended extensive changes inthis part ``regardless of whether these regulations remain under 30 CFRor are reassigned to 43 CFR.''<T3>MMS Response: </T3>No changes to the proposed section will be madein the final rule. However, because this regulation is the responsibilityof the BLM, it is being redesignated as 43 CFR 3162.7-4. After redesignation,BLM may elect to make certain revisions. MMS has corrected typographicalerrors which appeared in the proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Procedural Matters</ITAG>Executive Order 12291The Department of Interior (DOI) has determined that this document is nota major rule and does not require a regulatory analysis under ExecutiveOrder 12291. This rulemaking consolidates Federal and Indian oil royaltyvaluation regulations; clarifies DOI oil royalty valuation and oil transportationallowance policy; and provides for consistent royalty valuation policyamong all leasable minerals.Regulatory Flexibility ActBecause this rule primarily consolidates and streamlines existing regulationsfor consistent application, there are no significant additional requirementsor burdens placed upon small business entities as a result of the implementationof this rule. Therefore, the DOI has determined that this rulemaking willnot have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of smallentities and does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis under theRegulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, <T3>et seq.</T3>).Lessee reporting requirements will increase approximately $4 million. Alloil posted price bulletins or sales contracts will be required to be submittedonly upon request, or only in support of a lessee's valuation proposalin unique situations rather than routinely, as under the existing regulations.Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980The information collection and recordkeeping requirements located at andSection;andSection;206.105, 207.5, and 210.54 of this rule have been approved by the Officeof Management and Budget (OMB) under 44 U.S.C. 3504(h), and assigned OMBClearance Number 1010-0061.National Environmental Policy Act of 1969It is hereby determined that this rulemaking does not constitute a majorFederal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environmentand a detailed statement pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>30 CFR Part 202Coal, Continental shelf, Geothermal energy, Government contracts, Indianlands, Mineral royalties, Natural gas, Petroleum, Public lands-mineralresources, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.30 CFR Part 203Coal, Continental shelf, Geothermal energy, Government contracts, Indianlands, Mineral royalties, Natural gas, Petroleum, Public lands-mineralresources, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.30 CFR Part 206Coal, Continental shelf, Geothermal energy, Government contracts, Indianlands, Mineral royalties, Natural gas, Petroleum, Public lands-mineralresources, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.30 CFR Part 207Coal, Continental shelf, Geothermal energy, Government contracts, Indianlands, Mineral royalties, Natural gas, Petroleum, Public lands-mineralresources, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.30 CFR Part 210Coal, Continental shelf, Geothermal energy, Government contracts, Indianlands, Mineral royalties, Natural gas, Petroleum, Public lands-mineralresources, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.30 CFR Part 241Coal, Continental shelf, Geothermal energy, Government contracts, Indianlands, Mineral royalties, Natural gas, Penalties, Petroleum, Public lands-mineralresources, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.43 CFR Part 3100Government contracts, Land Management Bureau, Mineral royalties, Oil andgas exploration, Public lands-mineral resources, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Surety bonds.43 CFR Part 3160Government contracts, Indian-lands, Land Management Bureau, Mineral royalties,Oil and gas exploration, Penalties, Public lands-mineral resources, Reportingand recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: January 6, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">J.

The purpose of this subpart is toestablish the value of production, for royalty purposes, consistent withthe mineral leasing laws, other applicable laws, and lease terms.(b) If the specific provisions of any statute, treaty, or settlement agreementbetween the United States (or Indian lessor) and a lessee resulting fromadministrative or judicial litigation, or oil and gas lease subject tothe requirements of this subpart are inconsistent with any regulation inthis subpart, then the statute, treaty, lease provision or settlement agreementshall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.(c) All royalty payments made to MMS or to any Tribe or allottee are subjectto audit and adjustment.(d) The regulations in this subpart are intended to ensure that the trustresponsibilities of the United States with respect to the administrationof Indian oil and gas leases are discharged in accordance with the requirementsof the governing mineral leasing laws, treaties, and lease terms.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 206.101</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>For the purposes of this subpart:``Allowance'' means an approved or an MMS-initially accepted deductionin determining value for royalty purposes. ``Transportation allowance''means an allowance for the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lesseefor moving oil to a point of sale or point of delivery off the lease, unitarea, or communitized area, excluding gathering, or an approved or MMS-initiallyaccepted deduction for costs of such transportation, determined pursuantto this subpart.``Area'' means a geographic region at least as large as the defined limitsof an oil and/or gas field in which oil and/or gas lease products havesimilar quality, economic, and legal characteristics.``Arm's-length contract'' means a contract or agreement that has been arrivedat in the market place between independent, nonaffiliated persons withopposing economic interests regarding that contract. For purposes of thissubpart, two persons are affiliated if one person controls, is controlledby, or is under common control with another person. For purposes of thissubpart, based on the instruments of ownership of the voting securitiesof an entity, or based on other forms of ownership: (a) Ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutes control;(b) Ownership of 10 through 50 percent creates a presumption of control;and(c) Ownership of less than 10 percent creates a presumption of noncontrolwhich MMS may rebut if it demonstrates actual or legal control, includingthe existence of interlocking directorates.Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, contracts betweenrelatives, either by blood or by marriage, are not arm's-length contracts.The MMS may require the lessee to certify ownership control. To be consideredarm's-length for any production month, a contract must meet the requirementsof this definition for that production month, as well as when the contractwas executed.``Audit'' means a review, conducted in accordance with generally acceptedaccounting and auditing standards, of royalty payment compliance activitiesof lessees or other interest holders who pay royalties, rents, or bonuseson Federal and Indian leases. ``BIA'' means the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Department of the Interior.``BLM'' means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the Interior.``Condensate'' means liquid hydrocarbons (normally exceeding 40 degreesof API gravity) recovered at the surface without resorting to processing.Condensate is the mixture of liquid hydrocarbons that results from condensationof petroleum hydrocarbons existing initially in a gaseous phase in an undergroundreservoir. ``Contract'' means any oral or written agreement, including amendmentsor revisions thereto, between two or more persons and enforceable by lawthat with due consideration creates an obligation.    ``Field'' means a geographic region situated over one or more subsurfaceoil and gas reservoirs encompassing at least the outermost boundaries ofall oil and gas accumulations known to be within those reservoirs verticallyprojected to the land surface. Onshore fields are usually given names andtheir official boundaries are often designated by oil and gas regulatoryagencies in the respective States in which the fields are located. OuterContinental Shelf (OCS) fields are named and their boundaries are designatedby MMS.    ``Gathering'' means the movement of lease production to a central accumulationor treatment point on the lease, unit, or communitized area, or to a centralaccumulation or treatment point off the lease, unit, or communitized areaas approved by BLM or MMS OCS operations personnel for onshore and offshoreleases, respectively.    ``Gross proceeds'' (for royalty payment purposes) means the total moniesand other consideration accruing to an oil and gas lessee for the dispositionof the oil. Gross proceeds includes, but is not limited to, payments tothe lessee for certain services such as dehydration, measurement, and/orgathering to the extent that the lessee is obligated to perform them atno cost to the Federal Government or Indian lessor. Gross proceeds, asapplied to oil, also includes, but is not limited to reimbursements, including,but not limited to, reimbursements for harboring or terminalling fees.Tax reimbursements are part of the gross proceeds accruing to a lesseeeven though the Federal or Indian royalty interest may be exempt from taxation.Payment or credits for advanced exploration or development costs or prepaidreserve payments that are subject to recoupment through credits againstthe purchase price, or through reduced prices in later sales and whichare made before production commences, become part of gross proceeds asof the time of first production. Monies and other consideration, includingthe forms of consideration identified in this paragraph, to which a lesseeis contractually or legally entitled but which it does not seek to collectthrough reasonable efforts are also part of gross proceeds.    ``Indian allottee'' means any Indian for whom land or an interest in landis held in trust by the United States or who holds title subject to Federalrestriction against alienation.    ``Indian Tribe'' means any Indian Tribe, band, nation, pueblo, community,rancheria, colony, or other group of Indians for which any land or interestin land is held in trust by the United States or which is subject to Federalrestriction against alienation.    ``Lease'' means any contract, profit-share arrangement, joint venture,or other agreement issued or approved by the United States under a mineralleasing law that authorizes exploration for, development or extractionof, or removal of lease products_or the land area covered by that authorization,whichever is required by the context.    ``Lease products'' means any leased minerals attributable to, originatingfrom, or allocated to Outer Continental Shelf or onshore Federal or Indianleases.    ``Lessee'' means any person to whom the United States, an Indian Tribe,or an Indian allottee issues a lease, and any person who has been assignedan obligation to make royalty or other payments required by the lease.This includes any person who has an interest in a lease as well as an operatoror payor who has no interest in the lease but who has assumed the royaltypayment responsibility.    ``Like-quality lease products'' means lease products which have similarchemical, physical, and legal characteristics.    ``Load oil'' means any oil which has been used with respect to the operationof oil or gas wells for wellbore stimulation, workover, chemical treatment,or production purposes. It does not include oil used at the surface toplace lease production in marketable condition.    ``Marketable condition'' means lease products which are sufficiently freefrom impurities and otherwise in a condition that they will be acceptedby a purchaser under a sales contract typical for the field or area.   ``Marketing affiliate'' means an affiliate of the lessee whose functionis to acquire only the lessee's production and to market that production.   ``Minimum royalty'' means that minimum amount of annual royalty that thelessee must pay as specified in the lease or in applicable leasing regulations.   ``Net-back method'' (or workback method) means a method for calculatingmarket value of oil at the lease. Under this method, costs of transportation,processing, or manufacturing are deducted from the proceeds received forthe oil and any extracted, processed, or manufactured products, or fromthe value of the oil or any extracted, processed, or manufactured productsat the first point at which reasonable values for any such products maybe determined by a sale pursuant to an arm's-length contract or comparisonto other sales of such products, to ascertain value at the lease.    ``Net profit share'' (for applicable Federal and Indian lessees) meansthe specified share of the net profit from production of oil and gas asprovided in the agreement.    ``Oil'' means a mixture of hydrocarbons that existed in the liquid phasein natural underground reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric pressureafter passing through surface separating facilities and is marketed orused as such. Condensate recovered in lease separators or field facilitiesis considered to be oil. For purposes of royalty valuation, the term tarsands is defined separately from oil.    ``Oil shale'' means a kerogen-bearing rock (i.e., fossilized, insoluble,organic material). Separation of kerogen from oil shale may take placein situ or in surface retorts by various processes. The kerogen, upon distillation,will yield liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons.    ``Outer Continental Shelf (OCS'') means all submerged lands lying seawardand outside of the area of lands beneath navigable waters as defined inSection 2 of the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301) and of which thesubsoil and seabed appertain to the United States and are subject to itsjurisdiction and control.    ``Person'' means any individual, firm, corporation, association, partnership,consortium, or joint venture (when established as a separate entity).   ``Posted price'' means the price specified in publicly available postedprice bulletins, offshore or onshore terminal postings, or other pricenotices net of all adjustments for quality (e.g., API gravity, sulfur content,etc.) and location for oil in marketable condition.    ``Processing'' means any process designed to remove elements or compounds(hydrocarbon and nonhydrocarbon) from gas, including absorption, adsorption,or refrigeration. Field processes which normally take place on or nearthe lease, such as natural pressure reduction, mechanical separation, heating,cooling, dehydration, and compression are not considered processing. Thechanging of pressures and/or temperatures in a reservoir is not consideredprocessing.    ``Section 6 lease'' means an OCS lease subject to section 6 of the OuterContinental Shelf Lands Act, as amended, 43 U.S.C. 1335.    ``Selling arrangement'' means the individual contractual arrangements underwhich sales or dispositions of oil are made. Selling arrangements are describedby illustration in the MMS Royalty Management Program (Oil and Gas or SolidMinerals) Payor Handbook.    ``Spot sales agreement'' means a contract wherein a seller agrees to sellto a buyer a specified amount of oil at a specified price over a fixedperiod, usually of short duration, which does not normally require a cancellationnotice to terminate, and which does not contain an obligation, nor implyan intent, to continue in subsequent periods.           ``Tar sands'' means any consolidated or unconsolidated rock (other thancoal, oil shale, or gilsonite) that either contains a hydrocarbonaceousmaterial with a gas-free viscosity greater than 10,000 centipoise at originalreservoir temperature, or contains a hydrocarbonaceous material and isproduced by mining or quarrying.  <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 206.102</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Valuation standards.    </ITAG>(a)(1) The value of production, for royalty purposes, of oil from leasessubject to this subpart shall be the value determined pursuant to thissection less applicable allowances determined pursuant to this subpart. (2)(i) For any Indian leases which provide that the Secretary may considerthe highest price paid or offered for a major portion of production (majorportion) in determining value for royalty purposes, if data are availableto compute a major portion, MMS will, where practicable, compare the valuedetermined in accordance with this section with the major portion. Thevalue to be used in determining the value of production, for royalty purposes,shall be the higher of those two values.  (ii) For purposes of this paragraph, major portion means the highest pricepaid or offered at the time of production for the major portion of oilproduction from the same field. The major portion will be calculated usinglike-quality oil sold under arm's-length contracts from the same field(or, if necessary to obtain a reasonable sample, from the same area) foreach month. All such oil production will be arrayed from highest priceto lowest price (at the bottom). The major portion is that price at which50 percent (by volume) plus 1 barrel of the oil (starting from the bottom)is sold.    (b)(1)(i) The value of oil which is sold pursuant to an arm's-length contractshall be the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, except as providedin paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(iii) of this section. The lessee shallhave the burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. Thevalue which the lessee reports, for royalty purposes, is subject to monitoring,review, and audit. For purposes of this section, oil which is sold or otherwisetransferred to the lessee's marketing affiliate and then sold by the marketingaffiliate pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be valued in accordancewith this paragraph based upon the sale by the marketing affiliate.   (ii) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the contractreflects the total consideration actually transferred either directly orindirectly from the buyer to the seller for the oil. If the contract doesnot reflect the total consideration, then the MMS may require that theoil sold pursuant to that contract be valued in accordance with paragraph(c) of this section. Value may not be less than the gross proceeds accruingto the lessee, including the additional consideration.    (iii) If the MMS determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the lesseepursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the reasonable valueof the production because of misconduct by or between two contracting parties,or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor tomarket the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor,then MMS shall require that the oil production be valued pursuant to thefirst applicable of paragraph (c)(2), (c)(3), (c)(4), or (c)(5) of thissection. When MMS determines that the value may be unreasonable, MMS willnotify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide writteninformation justifying the lessee's value. If the oil production is thenvalued pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) or (c)(5) of this section, the notificationrequirements of paragraph (e) of this section shall apply.    (2) The MMS may require a lessee to certify that its arm's-length contractprovisions include all of the consideration to be paid by the buyer, eitherdirectly or indirectly, for the oil.    (c) The value of oil production from leases subject to this section whichis not sold pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be the reasonablevalue determined in accordance with the first applicable of the followingparagraphs:    (1) The lessee's contemporaneous posted prices or oil sales contract pricesused in arm's-length transactions for purchases or sales of significantquantities of like-quality oil in the same field (or, if necessary to obtaina reasonable sample, from the same area); provided, however, that thoseposted prices or oil sales contract prices are comparable to other contemporaneousposted prices or oil sales contract prices used in arm's-length transactionsfor purchases or sales of significant quantities of like-quality oil inthe same field (or, if necessary to obtain a reasonable sample, from thesame area). In evaluating the comparability of posted prices or oil salescontract prices, the following factors shall be considered: Price, duration,market or markets served, terms, quality of oil, volume, and other factorsas may be appropriate to reflect the value of the oil. If the lessee makesarm's-length purchases or sales at different postings or prices, then thevolume-weighted average price for the purchases or sales for the productionmonth reported on Form MMS-2014 will be used;    (2) The arithmetic average of contemporaneous posted prices used in arm's-lengthtransactions by persons other than the lessee for purchases or sales ofsignificant quantities of like-quality oil in the same field (or, if necessaryto obtain a reasonable sample, from the same area);    (3) The arithmetic average of other contemporaneous arm's-length contractprices for purchases or sales of significant quantities of like-qualityoil in the same area or nearby areas;    (4) Prices received for arm's-length spot sales of significant quantitiesof like-quality oil from the same field (or, if necessary to obtain a reasonablesample, from the same area), and other relevant matters, including informationsubmitted by the lessee concerning circumstances unique to a particularlease operation or the saleability of certain types of oil;    (5) A net-back method or any other reasonable method to determine value;   (6) For purposes of this paragraph, the term lessee includes the lessee'sdesignated purchasing agent, and the term contemporaneous means postingsor contract prices in effect at the time the royalty obligation is incurred.   (d) Any Federal or Indian lessee will make available, upon request to theauthorized MMS, State, or Indian representatives, to the Office of theInspector General of the Department of the Interior, or other persons authorizedto receive such information, arm's-length sales and volume data for like-qualityproduction sold, purchased, or otherwise obtained by the lessee from thefield or area or from nearby fields or areas.    (e)(1) Where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of thissection, the lessee shall retain all data relevant to the determinationof royalty value. Such data shall be subject to review and audit, and MMSwill direct a lessee to use a different value if it determines that thereported value is inconsistent with the requirements of these regulations.   (2) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined value pursuant to paragraph(c)(4) or (c)(5) of this section. The notification shall be by letter tothe MMS Associate Director for Royalty Management or his/her designee.The letter shall identify the valuation method to be used and contain abrief description of the procedure to be followed. The notification requiredby this paragraph is a one-time notification due no later than the endof the month following the month the lessee first reports royalties ona Form MMS-2014 using a valuation method authorized by paragraph (c)(4)or (c)(5) of this section and each time there is a change from one to theother of these two methods.  (f) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined value,the lessee shall pay the difference, if any, between royalty payments madebased upon the value it has used and the royalty payments that are duebased upon the value established by MMS. The lessee shall also pay intereston the difference computed pursuant to 30 CFR 218.54. If the lessee isentitled to a credit, MMS will provide instructions for the taking of thatcredit.(g) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that event,the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method and may usethat value for royalty payment purposes until MMS issues a value determination.The lessee shall submit all available data relevant to its proposal. MMSshall expeditiously determine the value based upon the lessee's proposaland any additional information MMS deems necessary. In making a value determination,MMS may use any of the valuation criteria authorized by this subpart. Thatdetermination shall remain effective for the period stated therein. AfterMMS issues its determination, the lessee shall make the adjustments inaccordance with paragraph (f) of this section.(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, under no circumstancesshall the value of production, for royalty purposes, be less than the grossproceeds accruing to the lessee for lease production, less applicable allowancesdetermined pursuant to this subpart.(i) The lessee is required to place oil in marketable condition at no costto the Federal Government or Indian lessor unless otherwise provided inthe lease agreement or this section. Where the value established pursuantto this section is determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, that valueshall be increased to the extent that the gross proceeds have been reducedbecause the purchaser, or any other person, is providing certain servicesthe cost of which ordinarily is the responsibility of the lessee to placethe oil in marketable condition.(j) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can receivethrough legally enforceable claims under its contract. Absent contractrevision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take proper or timely actionto receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled, it must pay royaltyat a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. Contract revisionsor amendments shall be in writing and signed by all parties to an arm's-lengthcontract. If the lessee makes timely application for a price increase orbenefit allowed under its contract but the purchaser refuses, and the lesseetakes reasonable measures, which are documented, to force purchaser compliance,the lessee will owe no additional royalties unless or until monies or considerationresulting from the price increase or additional benefits are received.This paragraph shall not be construed to permit a lessee to avoid its royaltypayment obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, in wholeor in part or timely, for a quantity of oil. (k) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the contrary,no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process that resultsin a redetermination by the MMS of value under this section shall be consideredfinal or binding as against the Federal Government, its beneficiaries,the Indian Tribes, or allottees until the audit period is formally closed.(l) Certain information submitted to MMS to support valuation proposals,including transportation allowances or extraordinary cost allowances, isexempted from disclosure by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552,or other Federal law. Any data specified by law to be privileged, confidential,or otherwise exempt, will be maintained in a confidential manner in accordancewith applicable laws and regulations. All requests for information aboutdeterminations made under this part are to be submitted in accordance withthe Freedom of Information Act regulation of the Department of the Interior,43 CFR Part 2. Nothing in this section is intended to limit or diminishin any manner whatsoever the right of an Indian lessor to obtain any andall information to which such lessor may be lawfully entitled from MMSor such lessor's lessee directly under the terms of the lease, 30 U.S.C.1733, or other applicable law.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 206.103 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Point of royalty settlement.</ITAG>(a)(1) Royalties shall be computed on the quantity and quality of oil asmeasured at the point of settlement approved by BLM or MMS for onshoreand offshore leases, respectively.(2) If the value of oil determined pursuant to andSection; 206.102 of thissubpart is based upon a quantity and/or quality different from the quantityand/or quality at the point of royalty settlement approved by the BLM foronshore leases or the MMS for offshore leases, the value shall be adjustedfor those differences in quantity and/or quality.(b) No deductions may be made from the royalty volume or royalty valuefor actual or theoretical losses. Any actual loss that may be sustainedprior to the royalty settlement metering or measurement point will notbe subject to royalty provided that such actual loss is determined to havebeen unavoidable by BLM or MMS, as appropriate.(c) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, royalties aredue on 100 percent of the volume measured at the approved point of royaltysettlement. There can be no reduction in that measured volume for actuallosses beyond the approved point of royalty settlement or for theoreticallosses that are claimed to have taken place either prior to or beyond theapproved point of royalty settlement.

The lessee shall have the burden of demonstratingthat its contract is arm's-length. Such allowances shall be subject tothe provisions of paragraph (f) of this section. Before any deduction maybe taken, the lessee must submit a completed page one of Form MMS-4110(and Schedule 1), Oil Transportation Allowance Report, in accordance withparagraph (c)(1) of this section. A transportation allowance may be claimedretroactively for a period of not more than 3 months prior to the firstday of the month that Form MMS-4110 is filed with MMS, unless MMS approvesa longer period upon a showing of good cause by the lessee.(ii) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the contractreflects more than the consideration actually transferred either directlyor indirectly from the lessee to the transporter for the transportation.If the contract reflects more than the total consideration, then the MMSmay require that the transportation allowance be determined in accordancewith paragraph (b) of this section.(iii) If the MMS determines that the consideration paid pursuant to anarm's-length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable valueof the transportation because of misconduct by or between the contractingparties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessorto market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor,then MMS shall require that the transportation allowance be determinedin accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.(2)(i) If an arm's-length transportation contract includes more than oneliquid product, and the transportation costs attributable to each productcannot be determined from the contract, then the total transportation costsshall be allocated in a consistent and equitable manner to each of theliquid products transported in the same proportion as the ratio of thevolume of each product (excluding waste products which have no value) tothe volume of all liquid products (excluding waste products which haveno value). Except as provided in this paragraph, no allowance may be takenfor the costs of transporting lease production which is not royalty-bearingwithout MMS approval. (ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (i), the lessee maypropose to MMS a cost allocation method on the basis of the values of theproducts transported. The MMS shall approve the method unless it determinesthat it is not consistent with the purposes of the regulations in thispart.(3) If an arm's-length transportation contract includes both gaseous andliquid products, and the transportation costs attributable to each productcannot be determined from the contract, the lessee shall propose an allocationprocedure to MMS. The lessee may use the oil transportation allowance determinedin accordance with its proposed allocation procedure until MMS issues itsdetermination on the acceptability of the cost allocation. The lessee shallsubmit all available data to support its proposal. The initial proposalmust be submitted by June 30, 1988 or within 3 months after the last dayof the month for which the lessee requests a transportation allowance,whichever is later (unless MMS approves a longer period). The MMS shallthen determine the oil transportation allowance based upon the lessee'sproposal and any additional information MMS deems necessary.(4) Where the lessee's payments for transportation under an arm's-lengthcontract are not on a dollar-per-unit basis, the lessee shall convert whateverconsideration is paid to a dollar value equivalent for the purposes ofthis section.(5) Where an arm's-length sales contract price, or a posted price, includesa provision whereby the listed price is reduced by a transportation factor,MMS will not consider the transportation factor to be a transportationallowance. The transportation factor may be used in determining the lessee'sgross proceeds for the sale of the product. The transportation factor maynot exceed 50 percent of the base price of the product without MMS approval.(b) <T3>Non-arm's-length or no contract</T3>. (1) If a lessee has a non-arm's-lengthtransportation contract or has no contract, including those situationswhere the lessee performs transportation services for itself, the transportationallowance will be based upon the lessee's reasonable, actual costs as providedin this paragraph. All transportation allowances deducted under a non-arms-lengthor no-contract situation are subject to monitoring, review, audit, andadjustment. Before any estimated or actual deduction may be taken, thelessee must submit a completed Form MMS-4110 in its entirety in accordancewith paragraph (c)(2) of this section. A transportation allowance may beclaimed retroactively for a period of not more than 3 months prior to thefirst day of the month that Form MMS-4110 is filed with MMS, unless MMSapproves a longer period upon a showing of good cause by the lessee. TheMMS will monitor the allowance deductions to determine whether lesseesare taking deductions that are reasonable and allowable. When necessaryor appropriate, MMS may direct a lessee to modify its estimated or actualtransportation allowance deduction.(2) The transportation allowance for non-arms-length or no-contract situationsshall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for transportation duringthe reporting period, including operating and maintenance expenses, overhead,and either depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investmentin accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equalto the initial capital investment in the transportation system multipliedby a rate of return in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of thissection. Allowable capital costs are generally those for depreciable fixedassets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment)which are an integral part of the transportation system.(i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and engineering;operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem property taxes;rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and attributable operatingexpense which the lessee can document.(ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the transportationsystem; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and other directlyallocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the lessee can document.(iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation andmaintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. Stateand Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, includingroyalties, are not allowable expenses.(iv) A lessee may use either depreciation or a return on depreciable capitalinvestment. After a lessee has elected to use either method for a transportationsystem, the lessee may not later elect to change to the other alternativewithout approval of the MMS.(A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a straight-linedepreciation method based on the life of equipment or on the life of thereserves which the transportation system services or on a unit-of-productionmethod. After an election is made, the lessee may not change methods withoutMMS approval. A change in ownership of a transportation system shall notalter the depreciation schedule established by the original transporter/lesseefor purposes of the allowance calculation. With or without a change inownership, a transportation system shall be depreciated only once. Equipmentshall not be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value.(B) The MMS shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the initial capitalinvestment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of returndetermined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No allowanceshall be provided for depreciation. This alternative shall apply only totransportation facilities first placed in service after March 1, 1988.(v) The rate of return shall be the industrial rate associated with Standardand Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return shall be the monthly averagerate as published in <T3>Standard and Poor's Bond Guide </T3>for the first month of the reportingperiod for which the allowance is applicable and shall be effective duringthe reporting period. The rate shall be redetermined at the beginning ofeach subsequent transportation allowance reporting period (which is determinedpursuant to paragraph (c) of this section).(3)(i) The deduction for transportation costs shall be determined on thebasis of the lessee's cost of transporting each product through each individualtransportation system. Where more than one liquid product is transported,allocation of costs to each of the liquid products transported shall bein the same proportion as the ratio of the volume of each liquid product(excluding waste products which have no value) to the volume of all liquidproducts (excluding waste products which have no value) and such allocationshall be made in a consistent and equitable manner. Except as providedin this paragraph, the lessee may not take an allowance for transportinglease production which is not royalty-bearing without MMS approval. (ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (i), the lessee maypropose to the MMS a cost allocation method on the basis of the valuesof the products transported. The MMS shall approve the method unless itdetermines that it is not consistent with the purposes of the regulationsin this part.(4) Where both gaseous and liquid products are transported through thesame transportation system, the lessee shall propose a cost allocationprocedure to MMS. The lessee may use the oil transportation allowance determinedin accordance with its proposed allocation procedure until MMS issues itsdetermination on the acceptability of the cost allocation. The lessee shallsubmit all available data to support its proposal. The initial proposalmust be submitted by June 30, 1988 or within 3 months after the last dayof the month for which the lessee requests a transportation allowance,whichever is later (unless MMS approves a longer period). The MMS shallthen determine the oil transportation allowance on the basis of the lessee'sproposal and any additional information MMS deems necessary. (5) A lessee may apply to the MMS for an exception from the requirementthat it compute actual costs in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) through(b)(4) of this section. The MMS will grant the exception only if the lesseehas a tariff for the transportation system approved by the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission (FERC) (for both Federal and Indian leases) or aState regulatory agency (for Federal leases). The MMS shall deny the exceptionrequest if it determines that the tariff is excessive as compared to arm's-lengthtransportation charges by pipelines, owned by the lessee or others, providingsimilar transportation services in that area. If there are no arm's-lengthtransportation charges, MMS shall deny the exception request if: (i) NoFERC or State regulatory agency cost analysis exists and the FERC or Stateregulatory agency, as applicable, has declined to investigate pursuantto MMS timely objections upon filing; and (ii) the tariff significantlyexceeds the lessee's actual costs for transportation as determined underthis section. (c) <T3>Reporting requirements.</T3> (1) Arm's-length contracts. (i) With theexception of those transportation allowances specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(v)and (c)(1)(vi) of this section, the lessee shall submit page one of theinitial Form MMS-4110 (and Schedule 1), Oil Transportation Allowance Report,prior to, or at the same time as, the transportation allowance determined,pursuant to an arm's-length contract, is reported on Form MMS-2014, Reportof Sales and Royalty Remittance. A Form MMS-4110 received by the end ofthe month that the Form MMS-2014 is due shall be considered to be timelyreceived.(ii) The initial Form MMS-4110 shall be effective for a reporting periodbeginning the month that the lessee is first authorized to deduct a transportationallowance and shall continue until the end of the calendar year, or untilthe applicable contract or rate terminates or is modified or amended, whicheveris earlier.(iii) After the initial reporting period and for succeeding reporting periods,lessees must submit page one of Form MMS-4110 (and Schedule 1) within 3months after the end of the calendar year, or after the applicable contractor rate terminates or is modified or amended, whichever is earlier, unlessMMS approves a longer period (during which period the lessee shall continueto use the allowance from the previous reporting period).(iv) The MMS may require that a lessee submit arm's-length transportationcontracts, production agreements, operating agreements, and related documents.Documents shall be submitted within a reasonable time, as determined byMMS.(v) Transportation allowances which are based on arm's-length contractsand which are in effect at the time these regulations become effectivewill be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. For the purposesof this section, only those allowances that have been approved by MMS inwriting shall qualify as being in effect at the time these regulationsbecome effective.(vi) The MMS may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting requirementswhich are different from the requirements of this section.(2) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (i) With the exception of those transportationallowances specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(v), (c)(2)(vii) and (c)(2)(viii)of this section, the lessee shall submit an initial Form MMS-4110 priorto, or at the same time as, the transportation allowance determined pursuantto a non-arm's-length contract or no-contract situation is reported onForm MMS-2014. A Form MMS-4110 received by the end of the month that theForm MMS-2014 is due shall be considered to be timely received. The initialreport may be based upon estimated costs.(ii) The initial Form MMS-4110 shall be effective for a reporting periodbeginning the month that the lessee first is authorized to deduct a transportationallowance and shall continue until the end of the calendar year, or untiltransportation under the non-arm's-length contract or the no-contract situationterminates, whichever is earlier.(iii) For calendar-year reporting periods succeeding the initial reportingperiod, the lessee shall submit a completed Form MMS-4110 containing theactual costs for the previous reporting period. If oil transportation iscontinuing, the lessee shall include on Form MMS-4110 its estimated costsfor the next calendar year. The estimated oil transportation allowanceshall be based on the actual costs for the previous reporting period plusor minus any adjustments which are based on the lessee's knowledge of decreasesor increases that will affect the allowance. MMS must receive the FormMMS-4110 within 3 months after the end of the previous reporting period,unless MMS approves a longer period (during which period the lessee shallcontinue to use the allowance from the previous reporting period).(iv) For new transportation facilities or arrangements, the lessee's initialForm MMS-4110 shall include estimates of the allowable oil transportationcosts for the applicable period. Cost estimates shall be based upon themost recently available operations data for the transportation system or,if such data are not available, the lessee shall use estimates based uponindustry data for similar transportation systems.(v) Non-arm's-length contract or no-contract transportation allowanceswhich are in effect at the time these regulations become effective willbe allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. For the purposesof this section, only those allowances that have been approved by MMS inwriting shall qualify as being in effect at the time these regulationsbecome effective.(vi) Upon request by MMS, the lessee shall submit all data used to prepareits Form MMS-4110. The data shall be provided within a reasonable periodof time, as determined by MMS.(vii) The MMS may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting requirementswhich are different from the requirements of this section.(viii) If the lessee is authorized to use its FERC-approved tariff as itstransportation cost in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section,it shall follow the reporting requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of thissection.(3) The MMS may establish reporting dates for individual lessees differentfrom those specified in this subpart in order to provide more effectiveadministration. Lessees will be notified of any change in their reportingperiod.(4) Transportation allowances must be reported as a separate line itemon Form MMS-2014, unless MMS approves a different reporting procedure.(d) <T3>Interest assessments for incorrect or late reports and for failureto report. </T3>(1) If a lessee deducts a transportation allowance on itsForm MMS-2014 without complying with the requirements of this section,the lessee shall pay interest only on the amount of such deduction untilthe requirements of this section are complied with. The lessee also shallrepay the amount of any allowance which is disallowed by this section.(2) If a lessee erroneously reports a transportation allowance which resultsin an underpayment of royalties, interest shall be paid on the amount ofthat underpayment.(3) Interest required to be paid by this section shall be determined inaccordance with 30 CFR 218.54.(e) <T3>Adjustments. </T3>(1) If the actual transportation allowance is lessthan the amount the lessee has estimated and taken during the reportingperiod, the lessee shall be required to pay additional royalties due plusinterest computed pursuant to 30 CFR 218.54, retroactive to the first monththe lessee is authorized to deduct a transportation allowance. If the actualtransportation allowance is greater than the amount the lessee has estimatedand taken during the reporting period, the lessee shall be entitled toa credit without interest.(2) For lessees transporting production from onshore Federal and Indianleases, the lessee must submit a corrected Form MMS-2014 to reflect actualcosts, together with any payment, in accordance with instructions providedby MMS. (3) For lessees transporting production from Federal OCS leases, if thelessee's estimated costs were more than the actual costs, the lessee mustsubmit a corrected Form MMS2014 to reflect actual costs together with itspayment, in accordance with instructions provided by MMS. If the lessee'sestimated costs were less than its actual costs, the refund procedure willbe specified by MMS. (f) <T3>Actual or theoretical losses. </T3>Notwithstanding any other provisionsof this subpart, for other than arm's-length contracts, no cost shall beallowed for oil transportation which results from payments (either volumetricor for value) for actual or theoretical losses. This section does not applywhen the transportation allowance is based upon a FERC or State regulatoryagency approved tariff.(g) <T3>Other transportation cost determinations. </T3>The provisions of thissection shall apply to determine transportation costs when establishingvalue using a netback valuation procedure or any other procedure that requiresdeduction of transportation costs.30 CFR Part 207 is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 207_SALES AGREEMENTS OR CONTRACTS GOVERNING THE DISPOSAL OF LEASEPRODUCTS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_General Provisions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">207.1 Required recordkeeping.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">207.2 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">207.3 Contracts made pursuant to new form leases.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">207.4 Contracts made pursuant to old form leases.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">207.5 Contract and sales agreement retention.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Oil, Gas and OCS Sulfur, General [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_Federal and Indian Oil [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart D_Federal and Indian Gas [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart E_Solid Minerals, General [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart F_Coal [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart G_Other Solid Minerals [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart H_Geothermal Resources [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart I_OCS Sulfur [Reserved]</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2/><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>25 U.S.C. 396 et seq.; 25 U.S.C. 396a et seq.; 25 U.S.C.2101 et seq.; 30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.; 30 U.S.C. 351 et seq.; 30 U.S.C. 1001et seq.; 30 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.; 43 U.S.C. 1301 et seq.; 43 U.S.C. 1331et seq.; and 43 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_General Provisions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 207.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Required recordkeeping.</ITAG>The recordkeeping requirements contained in this part have been approvedby the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.and assigned OMB Clearance Number 1010-0061.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 207.2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>The definitions in Part 206 of this title are applicable to this part.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 207.3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Contracts made pursuant to new form leases.</ITAG>On November 29, 1950 (15 FR 8585), a new lease form was adopted (Form 4-1158,15 FR 8585) containing provisions whereby the lessee agrees that nothingin any contract or other arrangement made for the sale or disposal of oil,gas, natural gasoline, and other products of the leased land, shall beconstrued as modifying any of the provisions of the lease, including, butnot limited to, provisions relating to gas waste, taking royalty-in-kind,and the method of computing royalties due as based on a minimum valuationand in accordance with the oil and gas valuation regulations.

The average daily production per well for a lease is computedon the basis of a 28-, 29-, 30-, or 31-day month (as the case may be),the number of wells on the leasehold counted as producing, and the grossproduction from the leasehold. The BLM authorized officer will determinewhich commercially productive wells shall be considered each month as producingwells for the purpose of computing royalty in accordance with the followingrules, and in the authorized officer's discretion may count as producingany commercially productive well shut in for conservation purposes.(a) For a previously producing leasehold, count as producing for everyday of the month each previously producing well that produced 15 days ormore during the month, and disregard wells that produced less than 15 daysduring the month.(b) Wells approved by the BLM authorized officer as input wells shall becounted as producing wells for the entire month if so used 15 days or moreduring the month and shall be disregarded if so used less than 15 daysduring the month.(c) When the initial production of a leasehold is made during the calendarmonth, compute royalty on the basis of producing well days.(d) When a new well is completed for production on a previously producingleasehold and produces for 10 days or more during the calendar month inwhich it is brought in, count such new wells as producing every day ofthe month in arriving at the number of producing well days. Do not countany new well that produces for less than 10 days during the calendar month.(e) Consider ``head wells'' that make their best production by intermittentpumping or flowing as producing every day of the month, provided they areregularly operated in this manner with approval of the BLM authorized officer.(f) For previously producing leaseholds on which no wells produced for15 days or more, compute royalty on the basis of actual producing welldays.(g) For previously producing leaseholds on which no wells were productiveduring the calendar month but from which oil was shipped, compute royaltyat the same royalty percentage as that of the last preceding calendar monthin which production and shipments were normal.(h) Rules for special cases not subject to definition, such as those arisingfrom averaging the production from two distinct sands or horizons whenthe production of one sand or horizon is relatively insignificant comparedto that of the other, shall be made by the BLM authorized officer as needarises.(i)(1) In the following summary of operations on a typical leasehold forthe month of June, the wells considered for the purpose of computing royaltyon the entire production of the property for the months are indicated.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,xs36</C> <H1>Well No. and record</H1><H1>Count (marked X)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1.
