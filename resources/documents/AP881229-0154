A report on the rebels' Radio Venceremos gave no breakdown ofdead and wounded. Nor did it say how many guerrillas were killed.   It claimed the guerrillas, from the Farabundo Marti NationalLiberation Front, caused $3 million in property damage throughsabotage attacks, including those on numerous military installations.   The independent Human Rights Commission of El Salvador said 1,747civilians were killed in violent conflicts this year and 231civilians were reported missing.   Commission spokesman Celia Medrano told a news conference thenumbers were up from last year, when the group reported 1,415civilians killed and 204 missing.   The head of the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, Col. ReneEmilio Ponce, recently said the army killed 914 guerrillas andwounded 702 in 1988.   Like the rebels, the military did not mention its own casualties.However, the military said it suffered a combined total of 2,039deaths and injuries between June 1987 and May 1988.   President Jose Napoleon Duarte condemned violence from both theleft and right late Wednesday after returning from Washington, wherehe underwent an evaluation of chemotherapy he is receiving forterminal liver cancer.   His successor, to be chosen in presidential elections in March,must seek an end to the 9-year conflict, he said.   ``If not, we are going to bring the country to a moment ofgigantic confrontations,'' Duarte said. ``We must seek the path oftolerance and comprehension.''   About 65,500 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in thewar between rebels and U.S.-backed governments since 1979.</TEXT></DOC>
