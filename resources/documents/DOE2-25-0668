Combustion air is blown from underneath throughthe fuel bed. The floor of the combustion chamber is made up by a numberof mainly parallel U-beams which cover the entire width of the chamberand are held together like a chain and are movable by means of a jointdriving device. The purpose for this is to get a continuous outfeed ofresidues from the combustion. The width of and pitch for the beams enablesthe primary air to be evenly distributed over the chamber floor.
