Sadler, 48, whose ``Ballad of the Green Berets'' was a No. 1 hitin 1966, is at the center of a battle between his mother and hisson, who both want to become his legal guardian.   Cuyahoga County Probate Judge John Donnelly on Friday filed atemporary restraining order preventing Sadler from being movedagainst his will from Cleveland. Donnelly said psychiatrist KurtBertschinger will evaluate Sadler by Jan. 20 to determine whether heis competent to make his own decisions.   ``He will remain at Southwest General Hospital until he wants toleave,'' Donnelly said.   The judge said he will decide after the evaluation whether thecourt has jurisdiction to appoint Sadler's mother as guardian.   ``If he is competent, maybe we don't need a guardian,'' saidDonnelly, adding that Sadler's 24-year-old son, Thor, would beallowed to visit his father.   Davidson County Probate Judge James Everett of Nashville, Tenn.,on Tuesday appointed the younger Sadler as temporary guardian, butDonnelly said Everett agreed Friday to the psychiatric evaluation.   Sadler, who was shot in the head in Guatemala City in September,checked out of Cleveland's Veterans Administration hospital Sundayagainst medical advice.   He left after learning that hospital officials planned to sendhim back to a Nashville VA hospital, said his attorney, JosephMeissner.   Thor Sadler said 30 percent of his father's brain was damaged bythe bullet.   Meissner said Friday that Sadler is mentally competent and wantshis mother, Blanche Bebe Sadler, appointed guardian to help himconduct his affairs.   A hearing is set in Nashville on Wednesday on a petition filedJan. 10 by Sadler's wife, Lavona Ruth, and children, Thor, Baron andBrooke, asking the court to appoint one of them guardian and returnSadler to Nashville.   Guatemala City police reports indicate Sadler was shot byaccident when a gun fell out of his pocket and went off while he wasriding in a taxi, his son said.   Sadler also is the author of more than 20 books, featuring Casca,a mercenary condemned to everlasting life until the Second Coming ofJesus Christ.</TEXT></DOC>
