The 5.6% rise in the deficit, from $35.67 billion in the second quarter, reflected an increase of about $2 billion, or 30%, in the trade deficit with Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore. The deficit narrowed by 2.2% in the second quarter.    The latest deficit exceeds the previous record of a revised $37.35 billion for the fourth quarter of 1985.    The new figures point up a serious problem for the Reagan administration, which is hoping to see the deficit narrow next year. Administration officials are expecting the sharp drop in the dollar's value against other major currencies over the past two years to help reduce the trade deficit next year, by making imports more expensive and U.S. exports more competitive overseas.    But the latest numbers point up a weakness in that analysis: all four of the newly industrialized countries in Asia have currencies that are kept closely tied to the dollar. As a result, the changes in the dollar aren't likely to make imports from those countries rise in price, and they may continue to increase in volume. For instance, the value of cars imported from South Korea, where Hyundais are produced, jumped 79% in the third quarter, while the average price of those cars fell slightly.    &quot;It's a very tough policy problem for the administration,&quot; said James Cochrane, chief economist at Texas Commerce Bancshares in Houston. &quot;The numbers suggest that the U.S. economy and the East Asian economies continue to be out of balance with each other.&quot;    The trade deficit with Japan also increased $1.7 billion in the third quarter, but that was principally due to a decline in U.S. exports of gold from an unusually high level in the second quarter, when Japan was importing gold for minting commemorative coins.    Total imports in the third quarter rose 2.4% to $92.99 billion after rising 0.8% in the second quarter to $90.82 billion. Exports rose a weak 0.3% in the third quarter to $55.32 billion after increasing 2.8% to $55.15 billion in the second quarter.    Petroleum imports in the third quarter rose 2.1% to $7.99 billion after dropping 21.8% in the second quarter to $7.83 billion. Agricultural exports rose 5.1% in the third quarter after dropping 13.4% in the previous period.    The latest overall deficit was up from $31.68 billion in the third quarter of 1985.    Unlike the department's monthly merchandise trade figures, the quarterly balance-of-payments merchandise trade measure doesn't include the cost of insurance and freight in import totals. The balance-of-payments figures also make adjustments for certain exports to Canada that aren't recorded with the Customs Service, and exclude military transactions. In addition, the quarterly figures are adjusted for seasonal variations, while the monthly figures aren't. </TEXT></DOC>
