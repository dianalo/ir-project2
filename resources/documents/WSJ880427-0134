That's especially true for local TV news, as his drives in the big Eastern primaries this month have shown.    Take, for instance, primary eve in New York, when the local stations covered the tearful funeral of a black patrolman who lost his life in yet another drug-related killing. The black cop's sobbing mother, in a fine broad Sunday hat, looked like women in the crowd at the Jackson community rally, which was shown later in the broadcast. And the street where Mr. Jackson demanded an assault on drugs looked like the background clips on the cop shooting.    It was as though Mr. Jackson had been there. No wonder the polls say that even people who don't like him think he'd be the best man to deal with the &quot;drug issue.&quot;    Jesse Jackson's ability to manipulate the media may well be judged historic. But the press, especially television, cannot help itself from using him too. Even though most media don't treat his candidacy as valid, the notepads and the cameras, like heat-seeking missiles, swing toward his incandescent character.    The image swirl happens, too, when local broadcasts pick up the network &quot;feed&quot; on Third World stories. When the hijacked Kuwaiti jet sat on a North African runway earlier this month, a New York station showed the PLO negotiators, with their trademark scarves, shuttling back and forth. Later that night, there was a library clip of Mr. Jackson hugging a man wearing the same scarf. And suddenly there was Mr. Jackson answering the &quot;tough question&quot; of the day.    For months the press called politicians &quot;soft on Jesse.&quot; After his Michigan victory the pols dared the media to crack down first. So reporters dutifully ask about &quot;Hymietown&quot; and Yasser Arafat, though the questions are almost always rhetorical and the answers fittingly evasive. On TV, however, it's Mr. Jackson near the heart of a story that is happening now -- even though the clip may have been intended to illustrate a Jackson &quot;negative.&quot;    Did a South Africa story slip through that country's press barricade? For the viewers most concerned about it, he owns that issue. If the Russians had rolled over West Germany last week, it might have made Messrs. Gore and Dukakis's tiff over whom to nuke newsworthy. Don't bet on that happening soon, but you can be sure that next week will bring more drug murders in California, more Palestinians killed on the West Bank and fresh atrocities in South Africa.    Mr. Jackson has absorbed whatever the press will give him, the useful along with the condescending. Television offers more of the former; print, the latter. In many newspapers his story is simply subtitled &quot;the black preacher,&quot; though he has rarely had a church of his own. But television news, tawdry as it is, has to let its pictures do the talking -- and you rarely see Mr. Jackson in church on television.    Campaigning in the name of &quot;we the people,&quot; Mr. Jackson can find fresh grievances daily, and link them to his platform, in every city and town. Last weekend in Pennsylvania he could be seen standing with long-striking workers at a Rust Belt plant, and later floating down the Monongahela River inspecting miles and miles of industrial ghost towns. The week before in New York City, a vital suspension bridge that happens to serve some of Mr. Jackson's most vocal detractors in the Jewish community was shut due to rusting beams. There was Mr. Jackson on the bridge, including it in his call to rebuild America.    Mayor Ed Koch, normally the highest-wattage political figure in New York's local media market, ripped into Mr. Jackson daily. Mr. Jackson, on the bridge, blithely responded, singing &quot;Koch's Bridge Is Falling Down.&quot; The mayor even waved Martin Luther King's blood at Mr. Jackson and called him a liar, but there was no video to back him up. Mr. Jackson looked better stonewalling on the King-shirt legend than Mr. Koch did raising the question. You don't have to answer on television when there are no clips -- them's the rules.    Newspapers will continue to outdo themselves with dismissals of Mr. Jackson's comments as sing-along-without-substance. They reserve the rights to the metaphors in their stories, and they picked them long before he won Michigan. In print, Mr. Jackson is a &quot;factor&quot; in the Democratic quest for the White House, a factor that has grown into a &quot;problem&quot; for the fractious party. But that story doesn't make it on local TV. Television is about living and dying and getting to work everyday. It's about who's up, but mostly who's down. It's better than a pulpit for Jesse Jackson.    ---   Mr. Wynter is a Journal copy editor in New York. </TEXT></DOC>
