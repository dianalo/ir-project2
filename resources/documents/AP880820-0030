Similarly, U.S. Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said he wasconcerned such long-term commitments from the government might meantaxpayers eventually will have to bail out the Federal Savings andLoan Insurance Corp.   ``Resolving hopelessly insolvent thrifts like these once and forall takes real money, no funny money notes and asset guarantees,''Schumer said.   He called the deal a ``temporary Band-Aid'' that only serves asa delay to a taxpayer bailout.   The FSLIC estimated Friday it will spend at least $5.5 billionover the next decade to create the new institution and combine thethrifts, which include three of the largest institutions in Dallas.   The merger, announced by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, isthe biggest under the government's Southwest Plan, which wasdeveloped to consolidate or close 120 ailing savings and loanassociations of the 279 operating in the state as of Jan.1.   The thrifts involved include Dallas-based Sunbelt SavingsAssociation of Texas, whose first-quarter loss of $1.2 billionranked it No. 1 for quarterly losses among the nation's savings andloans this year.   Also part of the consolidation are Western Federal Savings andamp;Loan Association of Dallas, which ranked 12th in losses for thefirst quarter, and Independent American Savings Association ofIrving, ranked 20th in first-quarter losses.   The other institutions are: First City Savings Association ofIrving; Federated Savings andamp; Loan of Brady; Multibanc SavingsAssociation of Alice; Texana Savings andamp; Loan Association, Texarkana;and Summit Savings Association of Dallas.   ``The eight thrifts have the most complex and troubled assetsportfolios in the state,'' said Mary Creedon of the Dallas officeof the FSLIC.   Sunbelt Savings F.S.B., as the consolidated institution will becalled, will be headed by Thomas J. Wageman, now director ofSunbelt Savings Association. Each of the eight merged thrifts willbe operated as branches and depositors will be covered, bank boardofficials said.   In the early 1980s, Sunbelt Savings Association thrived on realestate lending, and according to federal regulators, loose lendingpractices. Sunbelt and the seven other institutions hadinterlocking loans and investments, often lending money for thesame projects.   But as the Texas property boom went bust in 1985, primarilybecause of an overbuilt market, the fortunes of the eightinstitutions slid.   Friday's announcement was the second in as many days offederally sponsored consolidations of troubled Texas thrifts aspart of the government plan to rid the state of mismanaged andpoorly operating savings and loans. Thursday, the FSLIC announcedthe consolidation of 12 troubled thrifts.   In Utah, a settlement was reached that would return $100 millionto depositors in five failed thrifts.   The agreement, announced Friday night by Gov. Norm Bangerter,would pay $100 million of the $106 million that was on deposit whenthe savings and loans collapsed in 1986. It also contained aprovision to repay the remaining $6 million if and when the moneyis collected.   The five failed thrifts covered by the agreement, which issubject to legislative approval, were Western Heritage, Interlake,Copper State, Commerce Financial, and Charter Thrift and Loan.</TEXT></DOC>
