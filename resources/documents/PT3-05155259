The      compounds of formula (I) and salts thereof according to the invention      exhibit a superior aldose reductase inhibiting activity with simultaneous      high stability, so that they are useful for the prevention and therapy of      diabetic complications. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  FIELD OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention relates to an aldose reductase inhibitor. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Among biphenyl derivatives having an inhibiting activity for aldose      reductase, there have been known aldostatin (as disclosed in Japanese      patent application Kokai No. 205095/1987) and FR 900280 (as disclosed in      Japanese patent application Kokai No. 72144/1990), which are now under      examination for their application to the prevention of therapy of diabetic      complications, such as cataracts, retinal disease, neuropathy, nephropathy      and so on. </PAR><PAR>  Nevertheless, there is still a need to develop substances having a higher      aldose reductase inhibiting activity than those of the prior art. </PAR><PAR>  The inventors have studied the pharmacodynamics of various compounds to      find new aldose reductase inhibitors exhibiting superior inhibiting      activity and have discovered that a series of new biphenyl derivatives of      the formula (I)      ##STR2##      in which R denotes lower alkyl or cyclohexylmethyl and e,uns/n/  is 2 or      3, have greater activity for inhibiting aldose reductase than those known      heretofore. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Thus, the present invention provides new aldose reductase inhibitors      containing, as the effective component, a compound or a pharmaceutically      acceptable salt thereof represented by the formula (I)      ##STR3##      in which R and e,uns/n/  have the meanings given above. </PAR><PAR>  Among the compounds of formula (I), especially those in which R denotes an      alkyl group having 1-5 carbon atoms or a cyclohexylmethyl group are      preferred. </PAR><PAR>  Of these compounds of formula (I), the compound in which R denotes methyl      and e,uns/n/  is 3 is known (Indian Chem. Soc. 42, 86 (1965)), but its      pharmacological utility has not yet been reported. All the others are      novel compounds. While these novel compounds can be produced by a      production process similar to that of the known compound mentioned above,      it is also possible to synthesize them pursuant to the reaction scheme      given below. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, they are produced in accordance with the following reaction scheme:      ##STR4##      in which R and n have the meanings as given above, R.sub.1 represents a      radical removable by hydrolysis and X denotes a halogen atom, by      alkylating the phenolic hydroxyl groups of an esterified biphenyl      dicarboxylic compound of formula (III) using an alkyl halide of formula      (V) into the compound of formula (II) and then splitting the ester group      of formula (II) into a free acid of formula (I). </PAR><PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  As the alkyl halide of formula (V) used for alkylating the esterified      compound of formula (III), there may be exemplified alkyl iodides and      alkyl bromides of 1-5 carbon atoms, cyclohexylmethyl bromide and so on. </PAR><PAR>  The alkylation can be performed in an organic solvent which will not      participate in the reaction, such as DMF, acetone, dioxane,      tetrahydrofuran, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethyl acetate, methanol,      ethanol or so on, by introducing therein the esterified compound (III) and      the alkyl halide (V) and conducting the reaction in the presence of an      inorganic or organic base, for example, an alkali metal carbonate such as      anhydrous potassium carbonate or anhydrous sodium carbonate; an alkali      metal hydroxide such as sodium or potassium hydroxide; a tertiary      alkylamine such as trimethylamine or triethylamine; pyridine, or a      pyridine derivative such as picoline, lutidine or 4-dimethylaminopyridine;      a diazabicyclo compound such as 1,5-diazabicyclo (4.3.0)-nonene-5,      1,4-diazabicyclo (2.2.2)-octane, 1,8-diazabicyclo (5.4.0)-undecene-7; or a      metal alkoxide such as sodium methoxide or sodium ethoxide, together with,      if necessary, a small amount of copper powder as catalyst. </PAR><PAR>  The reaction is carried out in general at room temperature, or under      heating to 60.degree.-100.degree. C. for poorly reactive compounds, for      2-6 days with stirring. The amount of the reagents and catalyst may      preferably be in the range from 5 to 40 moles of the halide, from 2 to 7      of the base and from 0.5 to 1.5 times by weight of the catalyst per mole      of the starting compound. </PAR><PAR>  Among the starting compounds, namely, the esterified biphenyl compounds of      formula (III), the compound in which n is 2 is known ((J. Org. Chem. 46.      1991 (1981)) and the compound in which e,uns/n/  is 3 (IIIb) can be      prepared easily as shown in the following reaction scheme:      ##STR5##      by reacting pyridine-hydrochloric acid with a known compound of formula      (VI) at about 180.degree. C. to convert the methoxy group into hydroxide,      and then esterifying the carboxyl groups of the resulting product of      formula (VII) with a lower alcohol or the like. </PAR><PAR>  The ester splitting, namely, hydrolysis of the ester groups of the      resulting compound of formula (II), can be effected by reacting the ester      in an organic solvent such as ethanol, methanol, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran      or acetonitrile, with a base such as sodium hydroxide or potassium      hydroxide for 1-4 days at room temperature with stirring. The      concentration of the base to be employed may in general be in the range      from 1 to 3 N and it is preferably to use it in an amount of about 8 moles      per mole of the compound of formula (II). </PAR><PAR>  A compound of formula (I) according to the present invention obtained as      above can further be purified as required using any known purifying means      such as column chromatography on silica gel, recrystallization and so on. </PAR><PAR>  A compound of formula (I) according to the present invention can be      converted into a corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salt of an      inorganic cation of, for example, an alkali metal such as sodium or      potassium; an alkaline earth metal such as calcium or magnesium; and      ammonium, or an organic cation of, for example, a non-toxic organic amine. </PAR><PAR>  For preparing an inorganic salt, the compound of formula (I) according to      the present invention is preferably dissolved first in an aqueous solution      containing at least an equivalent amount of hydroxide, carbonate or of a      metal corresponding to the contemplated inorganic salt. For such salt      formation by reaction with a metal compound, a water-miscible organic      solvent inert to the reaction, such as methanol, ethanol, acetone or      dioxane may be admixed with the reaction mixture. If sodium hydroxide,      sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate is employed, a solution of the      corresponding sodium salt will be obtained. </PAR><PAR>  A solid salt can be obtained by evaporating off the solvent of such      solution or by adding to the solution a water-soluble organic solvent      having some polarity, such as butanol, ethyl methyl ketone or so on, to      cause deposition of the solid salt. </PAR><PAR>  The compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention or the      pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be administered to humans as      an aldose reductase inhibitor as such or in the form of a preparation with      a known carrier substance. </PAR><PAR>  The aldose reductase inhibitor according to the present invention can be      administered to human patients or to experimental animals, for example,      orally, rectally or parenterally, such as, by intravenous, intramuscular,      subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration and by eye wash. The      preparation of the compound according to the present invention may be      formulated so as to adapt to each of the above administration techniques. </PAR><PAR>  The preparation may be in any conventional form for human administration,      such as pellets, pills, powders, granules, capsules, suppositories,      injectables, eye drops and eye wash. For formulating such preparations for      oral administration, such as tablets, granules and capsules, the compound      according to the present invention may be mixed with, for example, an      excipient serving as a carrier substance, such as starch, lactose,      sucrose, mannite, carboxymethyl cellulose, corn starch and various      inorganic salts; binders such as starch, dextrin, gum arabic, gelatin,      hydroxypropyl starch, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose,      hydroxypropyl cellulose, crystalline cellulose, ethyl cellulose, polyvinyl      pyrrolidone and macrogol; disintegrators such as starch, hydroxypropyl      starch, carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and      hydroxypropyl cellulose; surface active agents, such as sodium lauryl      sulfate, soybean lecithin, fatty acid esters of sucrose and polysorbate      80; lubricating agents, such as talc, wax, hydrogenated vegetable oil,      fatty acid esters of sucrose, magnesium stearate and calcium stearate;      fluidizing agents; coloring agents and flavors and so on. </PAR><PAR>  The compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention or      pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be administered in the form      of suspensions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs. </PAR><PAR>  For parenteral preparations, there may be used distilled water for use for      injection, physiological saline solutions, aqueous solutions of glucose,      vegetable oils for injection, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and so      on as the diluent. It is permissible to further incorporate as required      sterilizers, antiseptics, stabilizers and so on. It is possible to prepare      such parenteral preparations, in consideration of their low stability as      freeze-dried products by subjecting the preparation placed in a suitable      vessel, such as a glass vial, to freeze drying, so as to permit      reproducing the preparation directly before its use by diluting with an      appropriate diluent. It is also possible to incorporate into the      preparation as required isotonating agents, stabilizers, aseptics,      analgesics and so on. </PAR><PAR>  The administration rate of the compound of formula (I) or the      pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof according to the present      invention may vary in accordance with each selected administration course      and with the condition of the acceptor to be administered, such as age,      body weight, disease condition and so on. It may be in general in the      range from 5 milligrams to 1 gram, preferably in the range from about 25      milligrams to 1 gram, preferably in the range from about 25 milligrams to      about 300 milligrams, calculated as the compound of formula (I), as the      total amount per day for an adult human, by administration once a day or      in two or three daily aliquots. </PAR><PAR>  Various compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention have      been examined for their pharmacodynamic behavior and for their acute      toxicity, of which the results are given below. </PAR><PAC>  METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE ENZYME REACTION INHIBITING ACTIVITY </PAC><PAR>  The preparation of aldose reductase and the determination of its enzyme      reaction inhibiting activity were carried out pursuant to the procedures      disclosed by Haymann et al. in Journal of Biological Chemistry, 240, 877      (1965). </PAR><PAR>  The sample solution to be examined for inhibiting activity was prepared by      dissolving an amount of a compound of formula (I) according to the present      invention in a small amount of methanol and increasing the volume of the      resulting methanol solution by diluting it with distilled water up to      tenfold volume. As the enzyme, i.e. aldose reductase, originating from the      lens of cattle, was employed after being subjected to a partial      purification. </PAR><PAR>  To 2.4 ml of 5.times.10.sup.-5 M NADPH solution dissolved in a 2/15 M      phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.0), 0.4 ml of the enzyme solution and 0.1      ml of the sample solution to be examined were added and the mixture was      charged in a quartz cell in a photoelectric photometer and was subjected      to preincubation at 37.degree. C. for 4 mins. Then, 0.1 ml of a 0.015 M      D,L-glyceraldehyde solution was added thereto for initiating the enzyme      reaction and the decrease in the photoabsorbance at 340 nm was measured at      37.degree. C. for 4 mins. The aldose reductase inhibiting activity      calculated by      ##EQU1##      in which A represents the enzyme reaction rate with addition of the      inhibitor and B denotes the enzyme reaction rate without addition of the      inhibitor. </PAR><PAC>  2) ACTIVITY FOR SUPPRESSING ACCUMULATION OF SORBITOL </PAC><PAC>  (A) Tissue Culture </PAC><PAR>  Lenses and sciatic nerves excised from 7 weeks-old male Wistar rats were      washed twice with an aseptic buffer solution consisting of 0.3%      trisaminomethane, 0.8% NaCl, 0.038% KCl, 0.025% Na.sub.2      HPO.sub.4.12H.sub.2 O, 0.1% glucose and 1.85 ml/1 of concentrated HCl. </PAR><PAR>  The lenses and the sciatic nerves were then treated by a 30 mins.      preculture in a culture medium prepared by adding 2 ml of 7.5% conc.      aseptic NaHCO.sub.3 solution and 5.5 ml of aseptic calf fetus serum to 100      ml of an aseptic culture medium of 0.98% TC Medium 199 (supplied from the      firm NISSUI) containing 0.01% of dihydrostreptomycin and 0.01% of      benzyl-penicillin. Thereafter, the intrinsic culture was effected in a      culture medium prepared by adding each sample solution to be examined and      0.09% of glucose to the above-mentioned culture medium and permitting      culturing to proceed for 20 hours. The culturing was effected at      37.degree. C. in an atmosphere composed of 95% air and 5% CO.sub.2. </PAR><PAR>  After culturing, the cultured samples of lens and sciatic nerve were      removed from the culture medium to filter paper and the weight of each of      them was measured after the adherent culture solution had been blown off.      Then, each of the cultured samples was homogenized with the addition of 1      ml of a cold 8% HClO.sub.4 solution and the homogenized mixture was      subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 G for 10 mins., whereby a      supernatant was obtained. The resulting precipitate was then homogenized      again with addition thereto of 0.5 ml of cold 8% HClO.sub.4 solution and      the homogenized mixture was again subjected to centrifugation in a similar      way as above to obtain a further supernatant. This was combined with the      previously obtained supernatant and the resulting solution was neutralized      with 2 N KOH aq. solution and was diluted with distilled water to a volume      of 5 ml. The precipitate formed by neutralization was separated by      centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 mins. and the resulting supernatant was      employed as the sample for determining the sorbitol content. </PAR><PAC>  (B) Determination of Sorbitol Content </PAC><PAR>  The determination of the sorbitol content in the lens and in the sciatic      nerve was carried out in accordance with the technique of Bergmeyer in      &quot;Methods of Enzymatic Analysis&quot; edited by H.U. Bergmeyer, pp 1323-1326,      Academic Press, New York, 1974 and in accordance with the technique      proposed by Malaon et al. in &quot;Diabetes&quot; 29, 861-864 (1980). </PAR><PAR>  To 0.5 ml of the sample solution for determination of sorbitol content      obtained as above, 0.9 ml of 0.1 M glycine-KOH buffer solution (pH 9.4)      containing 1 mM of NAD.sup.andplus; and 0.1 ml of a solution of sorbitol      dehydrogenase of 20 units/ml were added and the resulting mixture was      subjected to incubation at 37.degree. C. for 1 hour. </PAR><PAR>  The content of sorbitol in each tissue was estimated by assuming the      increment of the photoabsorbance at 340 nm to be proportional to the      amount of NADH produced by the reaction for the lens and by detecting the      fluorescence with an excitation wavelength of 366 nm and a fluorescence      wavelength of 425 nm for the sciatic nerve. </PAR><PAR>  The activity for suppressing accumulation of sorbitol, i.e. the aldose      reductase inhibiting activity, was calculated from the determined sorbitol      content by the calculation formula      ##EQU2##      in which A denotes the content of sorbitol per unit weight of the tissue      after cultivation with addition of the inhibitor, B denotes the sorbitol      content per unit weight of the tissue after cultivation without addition      of the inhibitor and C represents the sorbitol content per unit weight of      the tissue after cultivation in the medium without addition of glucose and      inhibitor. </PAR><PAR>  The results of the tests according to 1) and 2) above are summarized in      Table 1 below. Here, it is to be pointed out that the diester intermediate      of formula (II) in the production of the compound of formula (I) according      to the present invention and the products obtained in Reference Examples      1-8 hereinafter as well as the compound 2,2'-dimethoxy-5,      5'-bis(3-carboxypropyl) biphenyl diester, in themselves did not exhibit      any aldose reductase inhibiting activity, i.e. exhibited no activity for      suppressing accumulation of sorbitol. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE 1                                                          ______________________________________                                          ##STR6##                     (I')                                                            Enzyme   Inhibition Inhibition                                                 Reaction of Sorbite of Sorbite                                  Compound of    Inhibiting                                                                              Accumulat.
