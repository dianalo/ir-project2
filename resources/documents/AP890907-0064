The Economic Daily said the officials admitted their guilt andare awaiting sentencing. It said they were expelled from the party.   The officials, three from the northeast province of Heilongjiangand one from Inner Mongolia, have been members of the party for atleast 40 years.   Also today, China welcomed its first foreign head of state to thecountry since the June 3-4 military attack on pro-democracyprotesters. President Blaise Compaore of the western Africa countryof Burkina Faso was welcomed in Tiananmen Square with a 21-gunsalute.   ``You are the first head of state since we quelled thecounterrevolutionary rebellion,'' President Yang Shangkun said toCompaore after the ceremony.   The Economic Daily said Wang Lizhong, former head of thePetrochemical Industry and Environmental Protection bureaus inHeilongjiang; and Guan Wenbin, former vice-director of the DaqingPetrochemical factory, purchased 200 tons of benzene and 1,000 tonsof petroleum coke at lower state-set prices and then sold thematerials on the open market.   Wang made $5,135 on the deals and Guan received $5,400, the papersaid.   The newspaper quoted Guan as saying after his arrest: ``My wifeand children work, my family's living conditions are pretty good. Iused to not pay much attention to money, but now I'm old andselfish, I was thinking too much of myself ... It's a bitterlesson.''   Yao Zhiwu, an engineer and party official in Inner Mongolia, wasconvicted of accepting bribes totaling $5,400 from two constructioncompanies.   ``I was so stupid,'' the newspaper quoted Yao as saying. ``I haveenough money _ I just thought that if I had a little more, thingswould be more convenient.''   Yao conceded he committed the crime because his ``capitalisticworld vision had not been completely reformed.''   Li Kexiang, former vice-director of the Daqing PetrochemicalFactory in Heilongjiang, also accepted bribes of $2,700. ``My willpower is too weak,'' the Economic Daily quoted him as saying.   The newspaper said they are awaiting sentencing.   Corruption was a key issue raised by students during thenationwide pro-democracy movement this spring.   After the crackdown of the movement, China announced a majoranti-corruption campaign that would include top government officialsand party members.   Most of the cases involved officials who obtain large supplies ofscarce raw materials at low government-set prices and then sell themfor large profits on the free market.   The visit by Compaore was the first by a head of state sincePresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited in mid-May, when thestudent-led protests that began April 15 reached their peak.   Up to 1 million people crowded Tiananmen Square, forcinghumiliated officials to cancel ceremonies planned for Gorbachev inthe vast plaza.   Compaore was welcomed by Yang, one of the key figures behind thegovernment's decision to send troops to crush the studentdemonstrators. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, were believed killed inthe crackdown.   ``Your excellency and other African leaders have fully understoodand supported the quelling of the counter-revolutionary rebellion inBeijing. That's why we have to thank you,'' Yang told Compaore.   High-level diplomatic contacts with the West have been largelyfrozen since the crackdown, with the United States and other Westerncountries condemning the Chinese leadership for its violentsuppression of the student movement.</TEXT></DOC>
