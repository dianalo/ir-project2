(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>If ever there was a market ripe for the personal computer, it's thearchitectural and engineering services market known in the governmentalvernacular as SIC code 891X.andP;  Of the roughly 40,000 firms in the market, lessthan a hundred employ over 500 people, and three quarters employ less than20.andP;  Fragmented market That's about as fragmented as a market can get.andO;According to the Architect Institute of America (AIA) 85% of allarchitectural firms employ less than six people: this is not a mainframemarket.andP;  TFS'own Market Information Division reports there were less than1,000 mainframes installed in this market sector last year and less than10,000 multi-user minicomputers.andP;  AEC (architectural, engineering, andconstruction) is part of a CAD market which also includes mechanical,electronic, and mapping segment.andP;  Of the four, AEC is expected to have thehighest penetration of personal computers in the installed base by the end ofthis year  over 60% of total CAD seats,&quot; versus 42% for mechanical CAD and55% for electronic/electrical CAD, according to numbers published by SalomonBrothers.andP;  High growth sector And while AEC CAD garnered 14% of total CADmarket revenues for 1988, according to Dataquest, it obtained more than twicethat of total PC-based CAD revenues, according to TFS.andP;  What's more,Dataquest predicts that between 1988 and 1992 AEC CAD will show faster growththan any of the other three sectors  12% average annual revenue growth versus9% for the CAD industry as a whole.andP;  Reasons for robust market There may besome good reasons for this market robustness: * The market is still largelyuntapped.andP;  Many firms have yet toandM;acquire their first CAD package, and few firms have maxed out onandM;the number of &quot;seats&quot; they can support.andP;  * The functions most desirable tofacilities designers and  architectsandM;are now available on personal computers at reasonable prices  -andM;thanks to 386-based PCs and the Apple Macintosh II.andP;  * The market for add-onequipment and software will grow even asandM;the base market matures.andP;  * Smaller firms find the use of CAD can give themthe capability toandM;compete with larger firms.andP;  This last point is corroborated by data oncomputerization of architectural firms collected in a survey of 116 localfirms by Curt J.andP;  Cunningham, president of IHI, a Cambridge MA-based finnthat specializes in consulting with architects in CAD, and co-chair of theBoston Society of Architects (BSA) Committee on Computerization.andP;  &quot;We foundthat 85% of the firms with 36 employees had some CAD, versus only 20% of thefirms with under 10 employees, yet overall employees at small firms had moreaccess to CAD.andP;  In other words, the big firms had CAD but not enough to goaround.&quot; In small firms, CAD a necessity  &quot;We also found that many of thosesmall firms that did have CAD were into it in a big way.andP;  In many cases itwas their lifeblood.andP;  I see this in a personal way every day in my ownarchitectural business.andP;  And in this area, where there are a lot of high techcustomers, simply having a CAD system can be a marketing plus, even if youdon't use it.&quot; Cunningham's consulting experience also convinces him that CADis actually more successful in smaller firms.andP;  &quot;One of the keys to making CADwork in this business is management of the function, and in the smaller firmsthe principals tend to take a more active approach to using CAD.andP;  They learnhow to push the systems to their limits.&quot; One of the ironies of the AEC CADmarket - which is still a first time user market  - is that what motivates apotential user to buy is often not what he ends up using the system for onceit's installed.andP;  Database.- the  dominant need  According to data from an IBMsurvey published in ARCHITECTURE, the magazine of the AIA, at the time ofpurchase users are most concerned with the system's 3D capabilities.andP;  Database capabilities and detail design are of less interest and networking andprogramming capabilities are of practically no interest.andP;  Within a month,though, most users become much more concerned about data base issues anddetail design issues, and after they've had the system for three years whatthey worry about most are data base and integration issues.andP;  This can be fortwo reasons, notes Cunningham: (1) 3-D has become old hat and not an &quot;issue&quot;any more, or (2) the 3-D capability was never really used.andP;  CAD side effectsOnce CAD does penetrate the AEC community more fully, it's likely to havesome interesting side effects: *  It will go from being a nice-to-havecapability to a must-have one.andP;  *  The spectrum of CAD sophistication willelongate: adventurousandM;firms will be using the advanced features, like 3D modeling andandM;ray traced renderings, while slower firms will still be drafting.andP;  *  Theaftermarket for CAD peripherals, software, and add-ons willandM;start to take shape.andP;  *  The market will become less patient withinaccurately targetedandM;packages or inattentive vendors.andP;  *  The importance of graphics to AEC CADwill begin to give way toandM;data base functions.andP;  Database source of time saving Cunningham agrees withthis last point.andP;  &quot;Architects like to think they spend most of their timedesigning and drawing, but in fact they spend a lot of time with contractorsand customers on the phone and lots of time reviewing paperwork.andP;  It's thedata base functions of these CAD systems that allow architects to shorten thetime it takes to perform nonartistic functions like checking hardwareschedules against drawings.andP;  &quot; As for the design software itself, once usersdo get into it they do not gradually learn to overlook clumsy interfaces orrequirements to cope with the operating system.andP;  Their reasonable resentmentsurfaced in an evaluation review by Oliver R. Witte, in the February issue ofARCHITECTURE in an article entitled &quot;The &quot;Best of CADD Software.&quot; Witteconcluded: Architects want to do architecture, not computing &quot;If there wasone overriding lesson this evaluation made obvious it's that most vendorsstill cling to the fantasy that architects want to learn computing.andP;  Theydon't.andP;  Installing the software is as difficult in 1988 as it was in 1984.andO;In the past evaluators were understanding, allowing for the infancy of theCADD industry.andP;  But they are becoming impatient with systems that present ahostile environment.&quot; The evaluation included Arris (Sigma Design), AutoCAD(AutoDesk), Cadvance (Isicad), Datacad (Microtecture), Drawbase (SkokSystems), Point Line (Robi Graphiks), and VersaCAD (VersaCAD).andP;  A toughmarket The number of packages indicates the fragmentation of the market.andP;  Theresults of the evaluation demonstrate the tendency of users to become lockedinto whatever package they learn first.andP;  Each package received at least onevote for the best, but none received more than three (out of 14 reviewers),and every program except Datacad was also rated worst at least once.andP;  Onlytwo reviewers didn't vote for the package they themselves used as best.andP;  Suchloyalty is commendable, but it doesn't do much for vendors trying to figureout how to increase market share in this 40,000 company universe.andP;  If thesesophisticated evaluators can't agree on which package is best, how is avendor supposed to craft tomorrow's whiz bang offering? And there's anotherproblem looming on the low-end horizon  - the sudden availability ofMacintosh AEC CAD packages.andP;  As of this writing, AutoCAD was in beta testing,Schlumberger (Applicon) had agreed to port its Bravo!3 software to the Mac,and Apple had just announced it would be increasing the number of CADresellers in its distribution channel from 120 to over 200.andP;  New Mac packagescomplicate market &quot;Eighteen months ago there were only a handful of CADprograms to choose from on the MAC,&quot; notes Stephen Dill, chairman of theBSA's Macintosh user group, &quot;but now there are close to a dozen.andP;  Andalthough these are complex programs with plenty of hidden commands  -something Mac users aren't used to  - the Mac's graphical user interfacedrastically shortens learning time.&quot; Put that comment together with the onemade by Witte, and you can see the dilemma for both CAD suppliers and users.andO;Should one put the application on the PC first and then port it to the Mac,or does the Mac's user interface make it a better machine to start with? Macpresence up A year ago, in the survey conducted by Cunningham, there were 252PCs (including 386s) in the 116 firms queried, and only 74 Macintoshes  - aratio of 3.4 to one.andP;  But the ratio of 386 machines to Macintosh IIs was onlytwo to one.andP;  One would expect this year's survey to show an even higherproportion of Macs if Dill is right.andP;  So we have not only a fragmentedmarket, but a hotly contested one, with both workstation and PC productsissuing forth from former host-based vendors, like Intergraph, at a steadyclip, and with the CAD software package options increasing.andP;  It's enough tomake one relatively certain that any market forecast under 15% growth a yearis conservative.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
