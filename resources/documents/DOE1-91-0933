Heroin and cocaine each produced a distinctivepattern of activity increases and suppression throughout the rat brain.Similar regional changes induced by both drugs were found in limbic brainregions implicated in drug reinforcement. Labeled octanoate autoradiographywas used to measure the cerebral functional response to a tone that hadpreviously been paired to heroin injections. Rats were trained in groupsof three consisting of one heroin self-administration animal, and twoanimals receiving yoked infusion of heroin or saline. A tone was pairedwith each infusion during training. Behavioral experiments in similarlytrained rats demonstrated that these training conditions impart secondaryreinforcing properties to the tone in animals previously self-administeringheroin, while the tone remains behaviorally neutral in yoked-infusionrats. Cerebral functional activity was measured during presentation ofthe tone without drug infusion. Octanoate labeling density changed infifteen brain areas in response to the tone previously paired to heroinwithout response contingency. Labeling density was significantly modifiedin sixteen regions as a result of previously pairing the tone to response-contingentheroin infusions.</TEXT></DOC>
