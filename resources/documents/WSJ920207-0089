Repayment to the airline's unsecured creditors probablywon't exceed 25 cents on the dollar, according to peoplefamiliar with the plan. Continental said repayment may be aslittle as five cents on the dollar, depending on theresolution of claims by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. Atlast count, Continental Holdings said, 56,000 proofs of claimhad been filed, totaling about $4.3 billion of unsecuredclaims.</LP><TEXT>   Under the proposal, submitted to the U.S. Bankruptcy Courtin Wilmington, Del., yesterday, Continental would lower itslong-term debt to $1.7 billion from $5.8 billion currentlyand slash $270 million in annualized interest and expensecosts. The plan calls for a &quot;substantive consolidation&quot; ofthe claims against Continental Holdings and the 52 othersubsidiaries that filed for Chapter 11 protection in December1990.   The proposed reorganization plan is a consensual one,meaning that it has received the approval of the seven-membercommittee representing the company's unsecured creditors. Itstill must be approved by a majority of those creditors, inan equation that also requires the approval of holders oftwo-thirds of the dollar amount of all unsecured claims. Theplan also faces opposition from other creditors, includingholders of the company's senior debt and the federal pensionagency, one of Continental's largest creditors.   Continental Holdings, parent to Continental Airlines, hadwarned in filings to the Securities and Exchange Commissionas much as a year ago that it might seek to wipe outshareholders' equity in its attempt to emerge from Chapter11. Trading of the shares on the American Stock Exchange hadreached around $1, down from its 52-week high of $5. Intrading yesterday, the stock was down 62.5 cents to 37.5cents a share.   The company's stock will be delisted if the bankruptcycourt approves its reorganization plan. New stock is to beissued in a consolidated company made up of ContinentalAirlines and two subsidiaries, commuter line ContinentalExpress Inc., and System One Acquisition Corp., its computerreservation system. Continental will issue 50 million sharesof common stock to a trust for the benefit of creditors, whocan trade the shares. Creditors will almost certainly gainseveral seats on Continental boards. It's unclear how many,or indeed any, of the company's current board members willremain. A Continental spokesman declined to comment.   While the corporate makeup of Continetal may change, itsoperations are expected to remain essentially the same. Thecompany anticipates no furloughs or cutbacks, and it said itwill assume the leases on assets at its major hubs in Newark,Houston, Cleveland and Los Angeles. In its Denver hub, thecompany agreed to lease up to 30 gates at the as-yet unbuiltairport, and the city agreed to issue up to $100 million inbonds, but there are escape clauses in the contract.Continental said it may still acquire the Boeing Co. andAirbus Industrie jets it has on order &quot;if the manufacturerersagree to certain modifications&quot; of the contract.   Bennett Murphy, an attorney with the New York firm ofLatham andamp; Watkins who represents the creditors committee, saidthe airline that emerges from Chapter 11 &quot;will not bedramatically different from the airline of today, except withfar less leveraged balance sheet and a far greater likelihoodof success.&quot;   The amount the creditors ultimately will recover dependson many factors, but whatever the amount it will come in theform of stock, not cash. The company estimated the midrangefor unsecured creditors' recovery to be 12 to 18 cents on thedollar, depending on the outcome of its long-running disputewith the the federal pension agency.   The pension agency immediately labeled the planunacceptable. The agency claims Continental owes it $752million from underfunded pension plans at Eastern Airlines,which it once owned. In the reorganization plan, Continentalsays the pension agency is an unsecured creditor and shouldbe treated the same as all other claims; the agency contendsit's an administrative claim that should be put ahead ofothers.   Similarly, holders of senior debt at the airline are alsoopposed so far. &quot;We're definitely not on board, no way,&quot; saidJay Lustig, of Drake Capital Securities Inc. in Santa Monica.His firm holds about $40 million of Continental Holdingsbonds. Benjamin Waisbren, attorney for the official equityholders committee, said his group was still pushing for arights offering to shareholders and holders of subordinateddebt.   Since early 1989, six major carriers have sought courtprotection and three, Eastern, Pan Am Corp. and MidwayAirlines, shut down last year. Continental said it plans toemerge from Chapter 11 in July.</TEXT></DOC>
