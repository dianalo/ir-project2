There was no immediate response from the Salvadoran government,but it did announce a 48-hour cease-fire to begin Sept. 14 andcoincide with the celebration of Central America's independence fromSpain in 1821.   If the Salvadoran government agrees to peace talks, it would bethe first meeting between representatives of the belligerents sincePresident Alfredo Cristiani took office June 1 and called for peacetalks.   The guerrillas agreed at the time but the effort stalled becauseof a failure to agree on the details.   In a significant softening of previous rebel conditions, Ms.Martinez said the rebels would bargain with any committee thegovernment names.   Before, they had insisted that an army representative andhigh-level officials be at the negotiating table. They rejected onedelegation the government considered on grounds its members wouldnot have the power to negotiate.   The rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front representsfive left-wing guerrilla groups that have been fighting a successionof U.S.-backed Salvadoran governments since 1979.   In announcing the cease-fire Tuesday in El Salvador, Col.Inocente Montano, the vice minister of defense, did not mention therebel proposal for peace talks. But he but told reporters thecease-fire ``is a positive initiative ... as long as it isrespected'' by the rebels.   A cease-fire for the independence festivities had been suggestedMonday by the Permanent Committee of the National Debate for Peace,an organization representing more than 70 church, union,humanitarian and civic groups.   The government and rebel announcements followed a battle innortheastern El Salvador Tuesday in which at least 16 soldiers werekilled. Salvadoran armed forces spokesmen reported the deaths andsaid the rebels also suffered ``numerous casualties.''   The rebels suggested the period of Sept. 10-14 as dates andMexico as a site for talks in a proposal sent to Cristiani on Fridaythrough Monsignor Arturo Rivera Damas, the Roman Catholic archbishopof San Salvador, Ms. Martinez said.   She added the front has not received a reply from the governmentand said, ``We think with this block of measures there has to be ananswer before long.''   But she said the rebels had received an unacceptable response toa proposal that the government release all wounded rebels it isholding as prisoners.   Ms. Martinez said the proposal was made through Rivera Damas andthe government replied that it would release the wounded prisonersif the rebels stopped sabotaging electrical installations and liftedtheir bans on transportatrion.   ``That point was not negotiable,'' she said.   Mario Lopez, another rebel commander, told reporters new stepswould be announced on Thursday. ``Commanders will make public aseries of measures to create an atmosphere of confidence for thenegotiations,'' he said.   He did not elaborate, but there was speculation the steps mightinclude a cease-fire. In the past, the guerrillas have opposed aunilateral cease-fire, saying a truce would have be to be negotiatedat the bargaining table.   The rebels, in their proposal for talks next week, held to theircondition that Rivera Damas be present. Cristiani has said thearchbishop should not be involved.   The rebels have also insisted that delegates from theOrganization of American States and United Nations be present.   No agenda is being proposed for the talks, Ms. Martinez said,``because there has never been dialogue'' when topics have beenfixed in advance.   Three rounds of talks with the government of former PresidentJose Napoleon Duarte between 1984 and 1987 failed to make anyprogress toward ending the nearly 10-year-old war. Duarte headed acentrist Christian Democrat government.   An estimated 70,000 people, the majority of them civilians, havebeen killed in the fighting.</TEXT></DOC>
