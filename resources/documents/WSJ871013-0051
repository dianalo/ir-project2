He eschewed what he called &quot;radical new directions&quot; and urged Republicans instead to seek &quot;strong, steady and experienced leadership.&quot;    His remarks in a downtown hotel filled with balloons and bunting indicated that Mr. Bush intends to demonstrate broad appeal along with his loyalty to the president.    To Reagan loyalists, he said he was &quot;following a great presidency.&quot; To economic conservatives within his own party, he pledged: &quot;I am not going to raise your taxes -- period.&quot; To new-age Republicans hoping to make the GOP into a majority party, he said Republicans have a tradition of &quot;protecting those who needed our protection and making this a kinder nation.&quot; And to Hispanics he said: &quot;Estamos todos en familia,&quot; Spanish for &quot;We are all family.&quot;    When Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas formally announces his bid in early November, the field of Republican candidates will total six.    Mr. Bush enters the race as the Republican front-runner, possessed of the advantages of office -- he flew here on Air Force 2 and traveled through the downtown streets in a dozen-car motorcade -- and the largest campaign treasury in the Republican Party. He still needs, however, to project a clear, independent image beyond his caricature as an Eastern, Ivy League patrician with a breath of west Texas sand.    He was introduced at the rally by former Sen. John Tower of Texas, who headed the Iran-Contra commission that reported the vice president hadn't played a major role in the episode.    Mr. Bush is attempting to become the first vice president elected directly to the presidency since Martin Van Buren succeeded Andrew Jackson 150 years ago. More recently, Hubert Humphrey and Richard Nixon won their parties' nominations after serving as vice president, but neither was able to win the general election. Mr. Nixon didn't ascend to the presidency until eight years after his first try.    Mr. Bush's speech here was clearly an effort to burnish his image as he faces the prospect of an embarrassment in early 1988 political tests in Michigan, where Pat Robertson and New York Rep. Jack Kemp have teamed up against him, and in Iowa, where Sen. Dole is mounting a strong challenge.    A principal theme of his first campaign day was his experience, not only as vice president but as businessman, lawmaker, party chairman, China envoy, intelligence agency chieftan and tested political figure. &quot;I am not a mystic, and I do not yearn to lead a crusade,&quot; he said. &quot;My ambitions are perhaps less dramatic, but they are no less profound.&quot;    Mr. Bush offered few initiatives yesterday beyond a &quot;taxpayer's Bill of Rights&quot; that &quot;spells out explicitly what the limits of IRS power are.&quot; Instead, he sketched broad outlines that included a campaign to protect the environment and the use of the White House as a pulpit to win better race relations.    &quot;We need a new harmony . . . among races in our country,&quot; he said. &quot;The sadness of racial tensions in America should have ended completely by now. We are on a journey to a new century and we must, finally, leave the old baggage of bigotry behind us.&quot;    Mr. Bush called for a &quot;prudent skepticism&quot; toward the Soviet Union but sought to identify himself with the arms-control treaty expected to be completed by American and Soviet negotiators this autumn. And he took a hard-line stance on struggles between American and Soviet surrogates.    &quot;I intend to help the freedom fighters of the world fight for freedom,&quot; he said. &quot;In the hills of Afghanistan -- we will help them. In the plains of Africa -- we are on their side. And in a place called Nicaragua, we will help the Contras win democracy. This doctrine -- this doctrine of democracy -- must thunder on.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
