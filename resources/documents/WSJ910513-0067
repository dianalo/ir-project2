The purchase will approximately double Signet's operationsin the District of Columbia, giving it new business thatisn't encumbered by the bad real estate loans that broughtdown Madison.</LP><TEXT>   The Comptroller of the Currency, the supervisor ofnational banks, closed Madison Friday, and Signet reopenedsome of Madison's branches Saturday morning.   Madison concentrated on real estate loans and lent heavilyto local developers -- some of whom were on its board -- whohave been hurt by a deep real estate slump in the Washingtonarea. The comptroller's office said that &quot;poor underwritingstandards -- including making unsecured real estate loans,providing 100% financing of real estate projects, and lendingbased on character rather than cash flow-were major causes&quot;of the failure.   Signet paid the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. a premiumof $18 million for the franchises of Madison National Bank ofWashington and Madison National Bank of Virginia. Inaddition, Signet agreed to purchase at least $168.4 millionof assets from the two failed banks, which had total assetsof $706.8 million.   The FDIC also advanced Signet $480.9 million and took over$544.3 million of Madison's bad loans and other sour assets,which the FDIC will sell. In the end, the FDIC estimates thatthe failure will cost the Bank Insurance Fund $160 million.   The transaction protected all of Madison's depositors,even those with accounts over the federal insurance limit of$100,000, and allowed a quick resumption of banking servicesfor holders of Madison's 64,100 accounts containing depositsof $528.2 million.   The comptroller had been pressing the bank to address itsproblems since 1988. In recent months, the bank lost depositsas fears of its condition spread. As a result, the FederalReserve Board had lent Madison money to help it meetliquidity needs.   The technique the FDIC used to resolve the closure of thebanks is called a purchase and assumption because thepurchaser of the franchise also assumed all the deposits.This is the method the FDIC generally uses when it can find abuyer for the failed bank. Because all accounts aretransferred, depositors suffer no loss.   When the FDIC can't find a buyer for a failed bank, iteither closes the bank down and pays off depositors up to$100,000 or transfers all insured deposits to another bank.In both cases, large depositors lose at least a portion oftheir deposits over $100,000. This happened to depositors ofWashington Bank (of Maryland) based in Baltimore, astate-chartered bank the FDIC also closed Friday. Insureddeposits and fully secured liabilities were transferred toFirst National Bank of Maryland, also in Baltimore.   At the time the bank was closed, it had deposits of $35.4million in 2,100 accounts, including $338,000 in 38 accountsthat was in excess of the federal insurance ceiling of$100,000. These depositors will receive most of their moneyabove $100,000 after the FDIC sells the failed bank's assets.</TEXT></DOC>
