He grasps the pistol with both hands,points it at his abdomen and stares ahead grimly. He fires; hisbody jerks with the impact.   A grin spreads across his ruddy, weather-beaten face. ``Nothingto it, folks,'' he says with the satisfaction of a man who has shothimself more than 130 times as a sales pitch for the bulletproofvests his company manufactures.   But despite Davis' confidence in his product, the federalgovernment is pushing national standards for body armor that he andother producers consider unreasonable. The feud has become sobitter that some law enforcement groups, for whom vest quality is alife-or-death matter, are asking Congress to intervene.   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said he expects to introduce abill to establish mandatory standards this month. Sen. Carl Levin,D-Mich., has written Attorney General Dick Thornburgh urging him tomediate a compromise. ``The increasing uncertainty can only hurtlaw enforcement officers,'' Levin wrote.   The highly technical debate boils down to four issues: how thevests should be designed, particularly the amount of stuffingneeded to stop bullets; how they should be tested foreffectiveness; who should set the standards; and whether theyshould be voluntary or mandatory.   The National Institute of Justice, a branch of the JusticeDepartment, has set voluntary standards for vests and tested themfor quality since the early 1970s.   During testing, vests are mounted on clay blocks and bullets arefired into them from varying distances and angles. To meet NIJstandards, a vest must not only stop bullets; it must also preventthem from making an excessively large dent in the clay. That'sbecause a bullet can strike with enough force to damage internalorgans even if it doesn't penetrate the vest.   The government toughened its standards in 1987 to keep pace withchanges in weapons and ammunition, said Lester Shubin, science andtechnology director for the NIJ.   Suddenly, more than 50 percent of the vests were flunking thetests.   Manufacturers _ including Davis' Second Chance Body Armor ofCentral Lake, Mich., _ cried foul, saying the only way to ensurethat their vests consistently passed was to make them so thick andbulky that police wouldn't wear them.   ``Police officers don't really want to wear the stuff, anyway.Give them any excuse to take it off and they will,'' said EdBachner, ballistics manager for E.I. Du Pont de Nemours andamp; Co. Hiscompany manufactures Kevlar, the synthetic fiber used in mostbulletproof armor the past 20 years.   ``Police are dying because they aren't wearing vests, notbecause the vests are bad,'' Bachner said.   Surveys show that only about 30 percent of police wear vests,even though many law enforcement agencies require it, said GeorgeAustin Jr., national executive officer of the Fraternal Order ofPolice. Manufacturers say the number may be lower.   Du Pont has documented more than 1,000 ``saves,'' or incidentsin which wearing Kevlar body armor prevented death or seriousinjury, Bachner said. Most are shootings, but many saves haveinvolved stabbings, auto accidents and even a couple of bullgorings.   A single vest retails for about $350, Davis says, although herecently sold 4,000 to the Detroit Police Department for $175apiece.   Larry Gates, executive director of the Personal Protective ArmorAssociation, an industry group, says no vest has ever failed toprotect a wearer from bullets it was designed to stop.   ``They've performed flawlessly in the field, where it counts,''he said. ``But in the laboratory tests under the NIJ standards,over half the vests fail. The test is flawed ... but the NIJ won'tbudge.''   Shubin counters that vests have a good field record because hisagency's tests have kept duds off the market.   ``We believe a lot of their armor is marginal,'' he said. ``Butwe believe if it passes our standard it's going to work 100 percenton the street, and it has. We're being faulted for beingsuccessful.''   Last year, Du Pont and the Personal Protective Armor Associationestablished their own standards, which they say produce moreconsistent test results while meeting wearers' comfort requirements.   Shubin and many police leaders aren't convinced.   ``I could put up with a little discomfort in exchange for extraprotection,'' said Austin, the FOP officer and a Poquoson, Va.,beat cop. ``And I'm the one out there on the street getting shotat.''   Police generally have sided with the government in the dispute,although not unanimously.   New York City Police Commissioner Lee Brown, who favors the NIJstandards, calls the debate over vest design and testing proceduresa ``smoke screen.''   ``The issue is who's going to develop the standards,'' Brownsaid. ``I want them developed by someone who has no vested interestin selling a product.''   The Fraternal Order of Police wants Congress to designate anon-industry body such as the NIJ to set national standards, andthe International Association of Chiefs of Police has taken asimilar position.   But the State Association of Chiefs of Police, a division ofIACP, voted last month to oppose congressional intervention and toask the manufacturers and the NIJ to accept binding arbitration.   One vest manufacturer that supports the government standards isPoint Blank Body Armor of Amityville, N.Y. Company presidentRichard Stone says the industry's primary motive is to protectKevlar's dominance of the bulletproof vest market.   ``This is basically a commercial situation,'' Stone said. ``DuPont's had a virtual monopoly on body armor for 20 years and theywant to keep it that way.''   Du Pont's Bachner disagrees, saying the controversy arose beforethe recent emergence of competing synthetic fibers. ``I tell policeif they can find a better product they ought to buy it,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday PMs, May 14</NOTE></DOC>
