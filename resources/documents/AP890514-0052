(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The oldest mother who's a regular at theInternational Mother's Day Shrine is easy to shop for this time ofyear.   ``Usually they send flowers, but I told them if I couldn't eatit or wear it, don't send it,'' said Carrie Marshall, who at 98 wasthe oldest mother attending Sunday's services at the church whereMother's Day began in 1908.   Mrs. Marshall's 71-year-old son, Charles Jr., is a member of theGrafton Mother's Day committee.   The committee's roots go back 81 years, to the time when AnnaJarvis of Grafton wanted to set aside a day to honor her mother,also named Anna Jarvis, who had organized a Mothers Friendship Dayafter the Civil War to unite families who had split because of theconflict.   When Mrs. Jarvis died on May 9, 1905, Anna became determined toestablish Mother's Day.   On May 10, 1908, the first Mother's Day service was held inAndrews Methodist Church, which has since become the InternationalMother's Day Shrine and is used only for Mother's Day services andan occasional wedding.   This year, the Sunday services attracted about 200 visitors, notquite enough to fill up the church, said Betty Hayhurst, thedirector of the shrine for six years.   This year marks the 75th anniversary of federal recognition forMother's Day. And if the holiday seems overly commercialized today,it's interesting to note that its founder was concerned about thatdecades ago.   Like Mrs. Marshall, the younger Anna Jarvis didn't want to seeflowers deliverered on Mother's Day.   ``They're commercializing my Mother's Day,'' she once wrote tonewspapers. ``I wanted it to be a day of sentiment, not of profit.   ``Flowers are about half-dead by the time they're delivered. Youought to give your mother something useful, something permanent.   ``A maudlin and insincere printed card or a ready-made telegrammeans nothing except that you're too lazy to write to the woman whohas done more for you than anyone else in the world.''</TEXT></DOC>
