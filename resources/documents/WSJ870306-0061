The Mine Safety and Health Administration indicated that, if the citations are upheld by an agency review committee, it will revoke the prestigious Sentinels of Safety award held by the mine, Osage No. 3 in West Virginia, as the nation's safest underground coal mine. The award is given to the U.S. coal mine that operates the most hours during a year without an injury involving lost workdays.    In addition, the agency, citing the severity of the violations, said it is studying the possibility of a special fine against Consolidation of up to $40,000, or $10,000 for each citation. Ordinarily, such &quot;technical violations&quot; draw fines no higher than $20, but the paltry penalties have drawn criticism from some congressmen.    The agency's actions follow a report in The Wall Street Journal in December that Pittsburgh-based Consolidation, a Du Pont Co. unit, covered up accidents at Osage No. 3 to preserve the illusion of a spotless safety record. Several workers at the mine said they agreed to help cover up their accidents -- which ranged from torn shoulder tendons to bruised ribs -- by recording missed workdays as vacations or by recuperating at work.    The citations are the latest moves in the Labor Department's campaign against companies that don't properly report industrial accidents. The department has recently pursued fines against several big companies, including Union Carbide Corp. and Chrysler Corp., for allegedly failing to report hundreds of accidents at their plants.    Employers sometimes fudge corporate accident records in an effort to avoid federal inspections and reduce insurance and workers compensation costs.    Consolidation's Osage mine was cited for &quot;reckless disregard&quot; for failing to report lost-workday injuries involving three workers between June 1985 and September 1985, including one miner who missed three weeks of work after tearing shoulder tendons and was persuaded by the company to record it as a vacation. The safety agency also cited the company's Buchanan No. 1 mine in Virginia -- judged the nation's second-safest -- for &quot;high negligence&quot; in filing an &quot;inaccurate form&quot; that said a worker whose arm was nearly severed in a mining accident missed no workdays.    A Consolidation spokesman said the company &quot;strongly disagrees&quot; with the citations and will appeal them. He pointed out that federal inspectors conducted &quot;an intensive and complete . . . audit&quot; at both Buchanan and Osage in late 1985 before naming the mines the nation's two safest. &quot;For reasons unknown to us, the Department of Labor in Washington now has rejected the audits,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
