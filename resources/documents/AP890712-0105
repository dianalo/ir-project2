The latest casualties brought the overall toll to 405 peoplekilled and 1,593 wounded since the confrontation began March 8.   The leftist daily paper As-Safir, which has close ties to Syria,said the Christian army commander, Gen. Michel Aoun, was planning``a major escalation of the confrontation in the next few days withthe aim of achieving a meeting of the U.N. Security Council onLebanon.''   The conservative daily paper Ad-Diyar quoted an unidentified``senior source'' in Christian east Beirut as predicting a ``majorescalation of hostilities'' by the weekend if a three-member ArabLeague committee failed to persuade Syria to lift its naval blockadeof Christian ports.   As-Safir, quoting unidentified Western sources, said France andIraq support Aoun's plan to seek a settlement to theSyrian-Christian confrontation at the United Nations.   Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival, has declared support for Aoun's``war of liberation'' against Syria's 40,000 troops deployed inLebanon.   Aoun and other Christian leaders have accused the Syrians offailing to achieve a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the 22-nationArab League by siding with Moslems against the Christians in the14-year civil war.   Syria and its local Moslem and leftist militia allies haveaccused Aoun of blocking Arab League peace efforts. An aide to Aoun,speaking on condition of anonymity, denied that.   Syrian gunboats have blockaded the 28-mile Christian-controlledstretch of Lebanon's 130-mile Mediterranean coast.</TEXT></DOC>
