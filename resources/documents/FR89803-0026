Box 231,Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, has submitted pesticide petition(PP) 7E3493 to EPA on behalf of Dr. Robert H. Kupelian, National Director,IR-4 Project, and the Agricultural Experiment Station of Hawaii. This petition requested that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e)of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, propose the establishmentof a tolerance for residues of the insecticide fluvalinate in or on theraw agricultural commodity coffee at 0.01 part per million (ppm). This petition was later amended to propose that this use of the pesticidebe limited to Hawaii based on the geographical representation of the residuedata submitted. Additional residue data will be required to expand thearea of usage. Persons seeking geographically broader registration shouldcontact the Agency's Registration Division at the address provided above.The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have beenevaluated. The pesticide is considered useful for the purpose for whichthe tolerance is sought. The toxicological data considered in support of the proposed toleranceinclude: 1. Ninety-day feeding studies in rats and mice with a no-observed-effectlevel (NOEL) of 3.0 milligrams(mg)/kilogram(kg)/day in both species. 2. A 6-month feeding study in dogs with a NOEL of 5.0 mg/kg/day. 3. A 2-year feeding/oncogenicity study in rats with a systemic NOEL of1.0 mg/kg/day and no observed oncogenic effects under the conditions ofthe study. 4. A 2-year feeding/oncogenicity study in mice with a NOEL for systemiceffects at 10 mg/kg/day and no oncogenic effects under the conditions ofthe study at dosage levels of 2, 10, and 20 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 14,70, and 140 ppm). 5. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits with a NOEL of 50 mg/kg (highestdose tested) for teratogenic effects in rats and 125 mg/kg in rabbits.6. A two-generation rat reproduction study with a NOEL of 20 ppm (equivalentto 1.0 mg/kg/day). 7. The following mutagenicity studies: Ames' <T3>Salmonella </T3>microsome tests, sister chromatid exchange assay, mouselymphoma, unscheduled DNA synthesis, cell transformation (all negativeexcept the mouse lymphoma, which was positive with metabolic activation).The acceptable daily intake (ADI), based on the 2-year rat feeding study(NOEL of 1.0 mg/kg/day) and using a 100-fold safety factor, is calculatedto be 0.01 mg/kg of body weight/ day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution(TMRC) from existing tolerances for a 1.5-kg daily diet is calculated tobe 0.000159 mg/kg of body weight/day; the current action will increasethe TMRC by 0.000001 mg/kg of body weight/day (0.005 percent). The nature of the residues is adequately understood and an adequate analyticalmethod, gas chromatography, is available for enforcement purposes from:By mail, Information Services Section (H7506C), Program Management SupportDivision, Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency,401 M St. SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number:Rm. 246, CM-2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington VA 222022, (703)-557-3262.There are currently no actions pending against the continued registrationof this chemical. No secondary residues in meat, milk, or eggs are expectedsince the commodity is not considered a livestock feed commodity. Based on the above information considered by the Agency, the toleranceestablished by amending 40 CFR 180.427 would protect the public health.Therefore, it is proposed that the tolerance be established as set forthbelow. Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registrationof a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and RodenticideAct (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein,may request within 30 days after publication of this document in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>that this rulemaking proposal be referred toan Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FederalFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposedregulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document controlnumber, [PP 7E3493/P482]. All written comments filed in response to thispetition will be available in the Public Information Branch, at the addressgiven above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legalholidays. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Pursuant to the requirements ofthe Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C.601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishingnew tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions fromtolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. A certification statement to this effect waspublished in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180  </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticidesand pests, Recording and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 20, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Anne E.
