(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Grease-gobbling germs that eat themselvesto death while cleaning drains are the secret weapons of a fledglingfranchise business that bills itself as an ``HMO for restaurants.''   Bio-Care Inc., which has more than 200 clients in California, isgearing up for a nationwide grease-busting attack with the backingof a venture capital arm of W.R. Grace andamp; Co., the New York-basedchemical and natural resources company.   Bud McMahon, Bio-Care's founder and chairman, has big plans forthe little bugs his company uses, which he claims are safer tohandle than harsh chemical remedies.   ``Every sink and toilet in the country is a potential client,''he said. ``In our conservative projections, we figure we willservice about 10 percent of the 500,000 food service outlets in 60months, and the company at that time will have a value well over$200 million,'' he said.   The only way to get that many clients that fast, he said, isthrough a franchise organization. ``We have to open up the floodgates to the entrepreneur in the areas who want to do this kind ofbusiness.''   Bio-Care is like an HMO, or health maintenance organization,because it offers regular maintenance at a fixed price and willcorrect any problems at no additional cost, McMahon said.   ``It seems to be working fairly well,'' said Norman Fairchild,kitchen manager at the TGI Friday's chain restaurant in San Mateo.``We had enough problems before that we needed a service like this.They come out once a week for 15 or 20 minutes and spray into thedrains in the restaurants and outside. They guarantee their work, soit seems a good deal.''   The bugs that eat the grease are a blend of naturally occurringbacilli and pseudomonas bacteria that have been selectively adaptedfor Bio-Care by Sybron Chemicals Inc.   Sybron, a private company based in Birmingham, N.J., is thenation's largest supplier of specialized bacterial cultures for thepollution control industry. The company has sales of about $120million a year.   No genetic engineering was involved in creating the Bio-Careformula. Instead, the bacteria were chosen and cultivated for theirability to work together as they break down the types of foods thatusually clog drains.   Several kinds of the bacteria were developed and patented morethan a decade ago. Others were mixed in to suit Bio-Care's focus oncleaning up the gunk most often found in restaurant kitchen drains.It took nearly three years to come up with a formula, test it,refine it and produce a final product.   The bacteria break down animal fats and food products, liquifyingand digesting them and turning them into carbon dioxide, water andbacterial cells, the same way waste is normally disposed of innature. The Bio-Care bacteria keep eating and multiplying untiltheir food source is gone. Then they die off.   ``They grow very rapidly as long as there's a lot of food around,and can double as fast as every 20 minutes,'' said Mike Krupka,marketing manager for Sybron's biochemical division. ``But then thebeauty of it is, once whatever is clogging the drain goes away or istotally consumed, the bacteria run out of food and die off. They eatthemselves to death.''   About 5 billion bacteria are in each gram in the teabag-like``Bio-Sock'' packets used by Bio-Care to eliminate grease trapoverflow and reduce toxic odors associated with hydrogen sulfideaccumulation.   ``These are all certified non-pathogenic bacteria, meaning theydon't cause disease,'' Krupka said. ``They are not used primarily toget rid of clogs but rather for preventive maintenance. It keeps thegrease from accumulating in the pipes and it's not harsh ordangerous to handle the way strong chemicals can be.''   Clogged drains are more quickly cleared through a mechanicalprocess. Then the bacteria are used regularly to keep them clear, hesaid.   By April 1, Bio-Care plans to have franchise applications filedin all 50 states. By the end of the year it expects to have 15franchises in operation.   ``We're going to grow it very slow so everybody has theopportunity to never make mistakes; we're trying to make all themistakes now,'' McMahon said.</TEXT></DOC>
