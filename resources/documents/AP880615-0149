Albert Gore Jr. will endorse MichaelDukakis for president at a news conference in Nashville, Tenn., onThursday, an aide says.   The Tennessee senator, who ended his bid for the Democraticpresidential nomination after the New York primary in April, wasthe only former Dukakis rival who had not yet backed theMassachusetts governor.   Mike Kopp, Gore's press secretary, said Tuesday the senatorwould fly to Boston today and accompany Dukakis to Tennessee onWednesday.   Before going to Boston, Gore was meeting in his Senate officewith Jesse Jackson. While Jackson remains technically in the race,Dukakis has more than the 2,081 delegates needed for a majority atthe Democratic National Convention in July.   Kopp said Gore would urge his delegates to back Dukakis. TheAssociated Press delegate survey has shown a large number of Goredelegates already making that choice. In recent weeks, 114delegates elected as Gore supporters have switched to Dukakis.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   State officials were trying to assess theimpact of a judge's ruling that an independent presidentialcandidate deserves a place on the Michigan ballot without having tosubmit petition signatures.   U.S. District Judge Robert Demascio ruled Monday in Detroit thatLenora Fulani should have a place on the November ballot withouthaving to submit 24,000 petition signatures.   The judge ruled it was unconstitutional to apply to Fulani a newlaw requiring independent candidates to gather the signatures. Thelaw says the signatures have to be collected no more than 180 daysbefore the filing deadline. But the law didn't take effect until 81days before this year's deadline of July 21.   ``We maintain that's enough time for a bona fide candidate tocollect 24,000 signatures,'' said Elections Director ChristopherThomas.   Since Fulani was the only party to the lawsuit, it's unclearwhether the judge's ruling will apply to other would-be independentcandidates, he said.   Fulani, 38, of New York, was an unsuccessful gubernatorialcandidate in 1986 and mayoral candidate in 1985.

The party's convention committee is working out the bugs in anelectronic voting system that will allow delegations, using smallcomputers on the floor, to vote on the party platform andconvention rules. Votes would be displayed on a big overhead screenbehind the podium. ``But we will still do the roll call for thepresident and vice president in the traditional manner,'' said RuthBerry, a spokeswoman for the committee that is planning the July18-21 convention in Atlanta.   The state-by-state roll call, in which the head of eachdelegation takes the floor to announce the state's votes, ``is along-standing tradition,'' she said. ``It's something people expectand it adds excitement to the convention.''   Several other high-tech features are being explored by theconvention committee, including the electronics to allow delegatesto send messages to other delegates on the floor, computer tocomputer, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
