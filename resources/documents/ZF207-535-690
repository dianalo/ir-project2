 HellGraphics Systems, for example, wasn't even there.andP;  But DS America and Scitexhad new products, and the firstever ANPA meeting of the Mac Newspaper Users'Group led to the introduction of a few key products from Barco that shouldhelp establish the Mac II as a viable platform for newspaper color.andM;Among those that appeared at the show with products we've seen before wereCrosfield, Kodak and Royal Zenith (Diadem).andP;  Barneyscan and SeeColor haveupdated their software seen we'd seen it last, which prompted our coverage ofthem here.andM;News summary.andP;  The introduction of the Barco Calibrator for die Mac may nothave drawn too much attention among old-timers, but this device wiU make itposssible in the future to do quality retouching and separations with colorfidelity on a Macintosh.andP;  The device is independent of the applicationprogram, which might be from Barneyscan, Pre-Press Technologies, Avalon orsomeone else.andM;Codd-Barrett has improved its tint-laying system and showed how it might beput to good use in colorizing ads.andM;DS America introduced an innovative color scanner in which multiple laserdiodes are the light source.andP;  It also beefed up its scanning supportproducts.andM;Eklund showed the digital version of its inexpensive, small scanner.andM;Howtek became the first of the PC color-separation vendors to establishitself at the high end by winning a multimillion-dollar order from PPI, adeal that overshadowed the developments in the product itselfandM;Sakata Inx made its ANPA debut with a video-based color manipulation systemdesigned for enhancing still-video images going into print.andM;Scitex launched the Prisma in the U.S.andP;  Prisma is its new Whisper-basedworkstation roughly comparable to die Imager III in functionality.andP;  It waslauched a month earlier in Europe.andM;Barco supports MacandM;Barco gave the first public showing of its Calibrator monitor running on aMac.andP;  Barco claims that the monitor can be driven from any of the newgeneration of 32-bit cards from Radius, SuperMac or RasterOps.andP;  What it wasshowing, however, was the old 24-bit RasterOps card with its painfully slowscreen refresh.andP;  Nevertheless, it did demonstrate the viability of itshardware on a Mac II.andM;The Calibrator monitor is designed to provide the means to ensure consistentcolor display over a period of time using its calibration techniques.andP;  Whenit was introduced last year at IPEX, Barco was offering the product solely onan OEM basis.andP;  Now, with its Mac version, Barco will be offering thc productto the retail market.andM;The Calibrator consists of a color monitor, software and OptiSense, a devicethat attaches to the front of thc screen.andP;  OptiSense reads the amount oflight being output in terms of color values and color temperature, and it canadjust the monitor controls to ensure that it conforms to the definedstandards.andP;  There is also a closed loop system built into the monitor thatcontrols color drift automatically.andM;The software that comes with the system provides accurate setup of themonitor.andP;  There are three main controls.andP;  The first covers settings forcontrast and brightness by specific digital values, allowing for storedpresets by the user.andP;  This facility allows every monitor to be set up toidentical standards.andP;  There is also a degauss facility to demagnetize themonitor if it is moved.andP;  (Barco says the earth's magnetic field affects diesettings if the monitor is moved.)andM;The second control sets up the specific color temperature.andP;  Barco is alsoworking on a sensor control to compensate for color output based upon ambientlight in a room.andP;  Ibis new facility will be for OEMs and should be availablewithin twelve months.andM;The third control is the screen geometry, through which one controls theexact width, height, skew, etc.andP;  of the image on the screen.andP;  Thesemeasurements would be checked against a ruler held on the outside of diescreen.andM;All this extra control, which is going to become more important as morequality color moves to the Mac, will not be cheap.andP;  The Barco Calibratorcosts $6,700, and OptiSense costs $1,960.andM;Barneyscan's separatorandM;Barneyscan announced a method of doing non-PostScript color separations onthe Autologic APS-6 typesetter.andP;  It claims to bc able to convert a 35mm slideinto four film color separations in less than 16 minutes.andP;  The separations onthe Mac are translated into the format for the Autologic graphic interfacecard (AGI).andP;  The file is downloaded on Ethernet, and the APS6 with the AGIsets the separations and rotates the screens, then prints out the four filmsfor later stripping.andP;  The samples shown looked acceptable in quality fornewspaper work, but no customers were announced.andM;CoddBarrett lays down tints.,andM;We reported on thc CoddBarrett tint laying system for the first time atAmerica East, but there were two new facilities shown at ANPA that wouldappeal to many newspaper publishers.andP;  The first new facility was the linkingof the large-format 18&quot;wide ImagiTex scanner to the system for scanningbroadsheetsized line art.andP;  This connection is available through a PCinterface for the ImagiTex product.andP;  The system can also link up with theXerox 7650 scanner for tabloid-sized ads.andM;The second new facility was the ability to color type.andP;  The area to becolored is outlined, and the system changes all black areas to the designatedcolor.andM;CoddBarrett showed examples of the type of work that the system can handle.andO;Interestingly, up to now most tint systems have becn used primarily for comicsections, but CoddBarrett showed its system being used to colorize largeretail lads.andP;  This system appears to offer many, if not most, of thecolorizing facilities of the high-end display ad systems, and it appearssuitable for situations where outside artwork is sent in by the advertiser.andM;DS surprises with innovative scannerandM;DS America showed one of the few totally new products to be seen at ANPA: itslow-end color scanner, the SG 2010/2020.andP;  This is a smell format scanner witha maximum input of 10&quot;x 10.9&quot; and a maximum output of 13.5&quot;x 18.9&quot;.andO;Depending on the size of the required output, the unit can generate one, twoor four separations at a time.andM;Size, however, is not the key aspect of this new unit.andP;  Price is.andP;  At between$130,000 and $150,000, the SG 2910/2020 is the lowest-priced scanner yet fromDS.andP;  Its price compares weU with that of the DS 608, which seUs for around$195,000.andP;  (The higher-priced unit has an integral scanning preview monitor,the SK-2010 Image Checker, and a simpler user interface than the even moreexpensive, larger 608.)andM;The 2010/2020 is a two-unit scanner with separate analyze and exposure units.andO;The exposure unit is the first color scanner to utilize laser diodetechnology, with 10 laser diodes focused through optical fibers to a10-element recording head.andP;  In its use of multiple light sources, it followsthe lead set by Itek Colour Graphics, whose new scanners use multiple LEDs asthe exposure medium.andP;  Itek was the first vendor to make an electronicscreening scanner that did not use a single laser split into multiple beams.andM;The SG-2010/2020 is scheduled for first deliveries in the first quarter of1990.andM;Eklund goes digitalandM;Eklund was showing its new digital scanner, the 7920 DG.andP;  This unit is thesame size as the earlier analog scanner.andP;  The 7920 DG, which Eklund claimshas more definition in shadow and midtone areas, costs $13,000, which is$1,600 more than the analog unit.andP;  Its output recorder uses the sametechnology as before, a unique way of vaporizing away the material to createa negative with Eklund's scatter effect screen.andP;  Material cost is around$1.80 per separation.andM;The new unit only works from reflection copy and reproduces images only atthe same size.andP;  Eklund supplies an off-line unit that converts transparenciesto reflection copy and enlarges originals.andP;  Eklund is also working on anonline interface for the 7920 DG that will generate a series of bitmaps andwill enable it to be connected to a system.andM;We were advised that there are now more than 350 Eklund scanners in usearound the world.andP;  Howtek looking upandM;The big news at Howtek was its agreement with PPI, by which Howtck will bepart of a color system PPI will offer to its customers for page make-up.andP;  Upto now Howtek had only a limited number of installations in the U.S., Europeand South America.andP;  The PPI agreement is a multimillion-dollar deal thatshould firmly establish Howtek in the color-separation business.andP;  See TheLatest Word in this issue for full details.andM;The Howtek system has changed little since we last saw it apart fromcontinuing improvements in its functionality and quality.andP;  Improvements havebeen in many areas, but we particularly noticed how it is now enhancing thedata that is input from the Howtek scanners to improve color accuracy.andP;  Thisfunction includes an automatic lookup table on the preview scan and a coloreditor to remove superfluous color generated during the scan (which allhigh-end color scanners do).andP;  The system now offers image retouching using atiling approach for large images using the Truevision TIPS retouchingsoftware.andP;  Color page output can be to PostScript using Adobe screening, orvia Howtek's own RIP to ECRM Pelboxes, Monotype imagesetters and BidcoFrontPage 80C units.andM;Sakata Inx's first showingandM;Sakata Inx is a Japanese company that is just entering the color market.andP;  Itsfirst installation will be at the Asahi Shimbun newspaper in Tokyo in August.andM;Sakata's system is used to capture TV or still-video images and produceenhanced color-separated output for publication.andP;  It works from either videoor scanned images, and it has a maximum resolution of 2K x 2K pixels.andM;Single frames of a video image are grabbed on a PC and converted into an RGBsignal for display on the system's 24bit color monitor.andP;  The image isenhanced to remove frame-toframe interference.andP;  It is then piped from a PCinto a Sun-3/260 computer via Ethernet.andP;  Sakata is investigating theincorporation of TIFF or EPSF image formats.andM;in the Sun, tonal enhancement, color correction and image sharpening arecarried out as batch processes; changes are not seen on the screen.andP;  Sakata'sSun software also carries out RGB-to-CMYK conversion, undercolor removal andgray component replacement.andM;The Sun is linked to a Sakata output laser imager, a 5&quot;-perminute, 12&quot;-widedevice made in Japan by Tritech.andP;  The output unit can also be used as aninput scanner for monochrome images.andM;Scitex shows Prisma in U.S.andM;Scitex's major attraction at the show was die first showing of the new Prismaworkstation for the Whisper range.andP;  We covered this workstation recently inour coverage of the French Graphitec show, where the product was introduced(see Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  18) .andM;It is interesting to note the differences-between the European and U.S.andO;reactions to the product.andP;  In terms of raw functionality, the Prisma iscomparable to, or in some cases better than, the Scitex top-of-the-lineproduct, the Imager III, which runs on the older Fyrox hardware.andP;  There are alimited number of functions, primarily in the area of interfacing to otherperipherals, that the Imager III can handle that Prisma as yet cannot.andP;  InEurope, Scitex and its customers now view the Prisma as the replacement forthe Imager III; as such, the Imager will only be sold to an existing Fyroxcomputer customer.andP;  In the U.andP;  S., die market still perceives the Imager asthe top-of-the-line product, and Scitex America will continue selling theImager III as a mainline product.andM;The one Scitex product we had not had a chance to see before was its new VIPPostScript interpreter.andP;  This software product runs on the Macintosh II (withat least 8 MB of RAM) under the Mac operating system.andP;  It is a jointdevelopment between Adobe and Scitex.andP;  VIP, sold as an $8,000 option toScitex Visionary Gateway users, is a means of reading PostScript files into aScitex system as Scitex line art unages.andP;  It uses both Adobe and Bitstreamfonts in either Type I or Type 3 Adobe format.andP;  The system rasterizes thedata to the screen to act as a page preview in QuickView mode.andP;  It alsohandles RGB-to-YMCK conversion, although this can also be done by AdobeSeparator.andP;  VIP will start shipping on July 14th.andP;  Currently there are 70Visionary Gateway users and 300 Visionary end users in North America.andM;A further Visionary feature being developed, largely specified for Europe, isthe use of the Still layout description language.andP;  This enables Visionary togenerate page geometry and pass it back to a text editing front-end system sodie composition of that system can be used instead of the Visionarycomposition.andM;One further difference that was seen between the U.S.andP;  and Europe is aproduct marketed in die U.S.andP;  called Publisher.andP;  Scitex takes the SmartScanner plus the software for the Assembler running on a single-track Whispercomputer and seUs diem as a package to link with the Raystar imagesetter.andO;This is die same package as the starter system, but die Raystar issubstituted for the Dolev plotter.andM;SeeColor looking for lightandM;SeeColor is one the new companies in the PC-based color business hoping tocash in on the current interest in lower-cost color systems that usePostScript for output.andP;  We first saw die company's product a year ago, whenit introduced its color system for newspapers.andP;  Like other vendors in thisgame, SeeColor has been wrestling with the issues of performance, screeningand color quality.andM;Last year SeeColor talked of doing color separations on plain paper from a300- or 600-dpi laser printer.andP;  This year it dropped that part of its system,showing color separations generated from input from a number of desktop colorwanners, with screened output separations from various output devices at avery respectable speed.andP;  The system is not targeted at the highest-qualitycolor operations, but more at the newspaper quality of color with printing onnewsprint.andP;  At ANPA, SeeColor was also running on the Monotype standoutputting to anExpress imagesetter.andM;The SeeColor ColorSystem 2000 runs on a PC with a Targa 24 graphics card andits own image processing board, which handles color processing and screening.andO;The software covers a range of options, including a product called ColorArchitect, which supposedly compensates for the known deficiencies of theCCDs used in some of the input scanners it supports.andM;The image processing card and its screening software also allow manualadjustment for dot gain on die press and provide automatic gray componentreplacement and undercolor removal.andP;  The software also handles ink trappingconditions in chokes and spreads.andM;SeeColor is now using PageExpress from Networked Picture Systems for pageassembly and retouching.andM;Output speeds, from input through to completed output of an 8&quot; x 10&quot; scan atan 8 5 -line screen, are claimed to be in thc neighborhood of 25 minutes.andM;The system can also lirk up with PostScript and work with Quark Xpress viathe Quark Xtensions.andP;  In this scenario, a low-resolution image is put intoXpress, which passes back position, crop and scale information that is thenapplied to the high-resolution file.andP;  This file is then output via aPostScript interpreter running as a software RJP in the SeeColor computer tothe output unit with screening via the SeeColor Professional Image board.andM;SeeColor currendy has one user.andP;  The price of a system comprising an HPVectra 386 PC, Targa-24 graphics card, NEC Multisync monitor, SeeColorProfessional Image board (which is the Rip with its own '286 controlprocessor), plus a Nikon scanner and a 72-pica UltreSetter, is $89,990.andP;  TheNPS software is additional to this.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
