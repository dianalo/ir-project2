Synopsis </ITAG>On October 1, 1987, CHAMPUS adopted a DRG-based payment system for inpatientcare. Under this system, which Congress had adopted for Medicare severalyears earlier, payments for the costs of most inpatient hospital servicesare made on the basis of prospectively determined rates, applied on a per-dischargebasis. This payment system created needed incentives for efficiency inhospital services, but also surfaced concerns that a system that pays hospitalsa fixed amount per admission, regardless of length of stay, might compromisethe delivery of appropriate services or result in premature hospital discharges.When the Medicare prospective payment system was implemented, these concernsprompted Congress to establish Peer Review Organizations (PROs) to assurethe continuing provision of adequate and appropriate care to Medicare beneficiaries.Recognizing the need for a similar mechanism to protect CHAMPUS beneficiaries,the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Health and HumanServices, Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), entered into anInteragency Agreement to include CHAMPUS review in the Medicare PRO contracts.A joint collaborative effort between these two agencies is a sound, fiscallyresponsible approach to providing peer review of CHAMPUS inpatient care.This final rule supplements the existing regulation applicable to servicescovered by the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system with a series of additionsand clarifications that essentially fall into three broad categories. Thefirst is a set of rules, very similar to those applicable to Medicare,allowing payment or limiting financial liability under certain circumstancesfor services determined by the PRO to be potentially excludable. Thosecircumstances relate to cases in which the provider and/or beneficiarydid not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know that theservices were excludable by the PRO. The second category also addresses the matter of limiting beneficiary responsibilityfor charges, this time in the context of proposed discharges of patientsstill hospitalized. In cases in which the patient believes the dischargewould be premature, the rule establishes a procedure to assure a reasonableopportunity for PRO review. This is an important quality of care protectionfor beneficiaries. The third broad category of provisions included in this final rule is aset of procedures that are necessary and appropriate to augment the existingrequirements and facilitate successful implementation of the PRO program.These procedures are generally modeled after those applicable to the MedicarePRO program. A general theme underlying most of our existing PRO program rule, our proposedrule and this final rule is that successful and smooth implementation ofthe CHAMPUS PRO program, from the perspectives of beneficiaries, hospitals,the PROs, and the Government, will be facilitated to the extent we followthe path already established by the Medicare program.DoD believes the PRO program is a vitally important effort in assuringthat CHAMPUS beneficiaries receive medically necessary, quality care. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background </ITAG>We published a proposed rule for public comment on December 28, 1988, 53FR 52433, <T3>et seq.</T3> Under 10 U.S.C. 1079(j)(2)(A) CHAMPUS is authorized touse a diagnosis-related group (DRG) based payment system, similar to thatused for Medicare, for institutional providers. The Comprehensive OmnibusBudget Reconciliation Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99-272, established the ``Medicarelink'' that requires hospitals participating in the Medicare program toalso participate in the CHAMPUS program. Consistent with Congressionalintent, the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, implemented October l, 1987,is modeled after the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS).The CHAMPUS peer review program is established as a collateral programto the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. As the CHAMPUS DRG-based paymentsystem is modeled after the Medicare PPS, the CHAMPUS PRO program is modeledafter the Medicare PRO program. Through an Interagency Agreement betweenthe Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Health and HumanServices (DHHS), the CHAMPUS PRO program quality assurance and utilizationreview are being conducted by the same Peer Review Organizations (PROs)that also conduct review for Medicare. The Medicare PRO program is theFederal Government's primary program of medical peer review, operatingunder the careful oversight of Congress. Under the CHAMPUS PRO program, the PROs are reviewing care provided inhospitals for which payment is made under the CHAMPUS DRG-based paymentsystem. PROs are conducting both quality assurance and utilization review,specifically focusing on determining if the care met professionally recognizedstandards of care, if the admission was medically necessary, if the serviceswere appropriate, and if the care was provided in the most appropriatesetting. Cases reimbursed under the DRG system are subject to varied reviews,including generic quality screen reviews, admission and discharge reviews,and DRG validation. A major objective of these multiple types of reviewis to guard against premature discharge or inappropriate admission. Thepeer review system uses criteria which have been developed on both nationaland local levels to determine the adequacy and appropriateness of careand are specific to the CHAMPUS population. While review is currently being conducted only in acute care facilitiesfor services initially covered under the CHAMPUS DRG program, we expect,where appropriate, that other institutions and services later reimbursedunder the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system will be brought under PRO reviewin the future. On December 28, 1988, we published for public comment the proposed ruleon which this final rule is based. In the preamble to that rule, we explainedthat the existing CHAMPUS regulation, specifically 32 CFR 199.14(a)(1)(iv),prescribes the basic rules and procedures applicable to what is referredto in the regulation as ``quality of care reviews,'' which we now referto as the PRO program. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. General Comments on Proposed Rule</ITAG>A. Number and Types of Public Comment We received a total of 13 individual written comments addressing a varietyof issues. The types and volume of commenters were as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s50,3</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Hospital Associations <D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Medical Associations <D>4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Health Care Groups <D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hospitals<D>3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Peer Review Organizations <D>2</D></ITAG></ITAG> In general, we view the public reaction as generally positive. In accordancewith our usual procedures, we also obtained the concurrence of the Departmentof Health and Human Services, Department of Transportation, the militaryservices and several DoD offices. Based on comments, we have made a fewclarifying revisions to the rule, which are described below. In addition,by way of discussion in this preamble, we hope to clarify some other issuesthat arose. B. General Comments <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Photocopying costs </ITAG>One commenter stated that the HCFA reimbursement amount for photocopyingmedical records is insufficient. Although the photocopying cost reimbursement amount is not a subject addressedin this rule, DoD's position is that we will follow the Medicare programin so far as it appears reasonable and appropriate to the CHAMPUS PRO Program.We have adopted the Medicare reimbursement amount for copying costs andwill follow this policy. We are aware that the issue of photocopy costsis very controversial among hospital associations and is currently thesubject of litigation. Although DoD is not presently a party to this litigation,it is our intent to continue to follow the lead of the Medicare program,including any revisions that might be made to Medicare's policy as a resultof the litigation. In the meantime, we believe that the Medicare photocopyingcost reimbursement amount is reasonable and that any independent recalculationby DoD would be inappropriate.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Legal Authority</ITAG>In the preamble to the proposed rule, we included a note about legal authority,in which we attempted to explain the absence of legislative specificityunderlying the CHAMPUS PRO Program to those accustomed to the Medicaremodel of very detailed Congressional management of many aspects of thatprogram. We indicated that this is the norm for CHAMPUS, which has foryears operated with very detailed regulations covering the whole rangeof program operations, promulgated under the authority of very broad andgeneral statutory provisions. We also pointed out that included in ourgeneral legislative authorities are provisions, including 10 U.S.C. 1079(a)(13),prohibiting payment for services not medically necessary.One commenter took issue with the adequacy of our legal authority absentthe same kind of statutory specificity that controls the Medicare PRO program.This commenter called our proposed rule ``an illegal circumvention'' ofthe Administrative Procedure Act's  requirement, in 5 U.S.C. 553(b), thatnotices of proposed rulemaking include ``reference to the legal authorityunder which the rule is proposed.'' The commenter further argued that ourreferences to several statutory provisions we believe clearly authorizeour PRO program activities were not sufficient because these provisionsmerely allow ``claims auditing'' and ``simple review procedures,'' anddo not ``authorize DoD to implement a sanctioning mechanism, limit beneficiaryliability, or saddle providers with'' photocopying costs.In response to this comment, we have re-reviewed our legal authority forthe PRO program and this regulation and have reaffirmed its adequacy. Recognizingthat CHAMPUS is different from Medicare in this regard, the fact is thatmost of some 125 pages of CHAMPUS rules in the<T3> Code of Federal Regulations,</T3> as well as many other program procedures,have been promulgated under the authority of very general statutory provisions,including our basic legislative charge, at 10 U.S.C. 1079(a), that theSecretary of Defense shall establish CHAMPUS ``under such insurance, medicalservice or health plans as he considers appropriate.'' The Secretary hasconsidered it necessary and appropriate to establish numerous rules andprocedures to assure that the medical care provided under the authorityof that statute meets reasonable standards of quality and medical necessity.Examples include many provider certification standards, under 32 CFR 199.6,to assure that only qualified providers are allowed to participate andscores of benefit restrictions, under 32 CFR 199.4, many of which are designedto assure that only medically necessary care is provided. The PRO programand this regulation supplement previously operating practices with morerefined and efficacious review methods, rights, responsibilities and complianceprocedures necessary to help meet those reasonable standards of qualityand medical necessity.Guided by this long-standing construction of the statute, it is our conclusionthat our legal authority to administer CHAMPUS is not limited to some narrowdefinition of ``claims auditing'' or ``simple review procedures.'' Rather,we believe it supports all provisions of this final rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Coordination between DoD and the Health Care Financing Administration</ITAG>One commenter emphasized the need for close coordination of CHAMPUS PROprogram policy with the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), whichadministers Medicare. We strongly agree. An Interagency Agreement betweenthe Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Health and HumanServices (DHHS), delineates a close working relationship between the DoDCHAMPUS PRO Program Office and HCFA. Consistent with this policy, thisfinal rule follows Medicare procedures very closely.Related to this issue of following Medicare's PRO procedures, some commentersreported that they had difficulty understanding exactly what the proposedrule was proposing due to its numerous incorporations by reference to Medicareregulations; to understand the proposed CHAMPUS rule, one had to have availablevarious parts of Medicare's rules. This point is well taken. All thingsconsidered, we see it as an advantage to hospitals and the PROs to incorporateby reference in our regulation whole parts of the Medicare rules with whichthey are already well familiar. However, we recognize that for other readers,this is not necessarily advantageous. Therefore, it is our intention inthe very near future to compile excerpts of the Medicare regulations weare incorporating by reference, and to make those available to any interestedparties, along with a reprint of the full CHAMPUS PRO program regulation(as amended by this final rule). This should alleviate the confusion.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Relationship to other programs</ITAG>Some commenters stated that the proposed rule failed to take into accountthe review process of the existing CHAMPUS Reform Initiative (CRI) andthat PRO review would duplicate the monitoring of care already providedto CHAMPUS beneficiaries under CRI. The proposed and final rule do notinclude any specific provisions regarding CRI. The Government's intent,as specified in the CRI contract, is for an <T3>external</T3> peer review program applicable to all hospitals treatingCHAMPUS patients. In the CRI States, the PRO program is an important supplementto any internal review; it will monitor, among other things, the impactof the internal review system on the quality of care. In order to maintainconsistency and comparability, the use of the CHAMPUS PRO program withinthe CRI States is most appropriate. Regarding the PRO program relationship to another recent CHAMPUS initiative,several comments addressed the timing for implementation of PRO reviewin children's hospitals and of neonatal services, which will begin to beincluded in the CHAMPUS DRG payment system effective April l, 1989. Theyalso expressed a need for sensitivity in the development of review criteriafor these areas of review. We agree with these comments. Following theinclusion of children's hospitals and neonatal services into the CHAMPUSDRG-based payment system, we anticipate beginning to phase in PRO reviewwithin approximately six months. We encourage affected providers to participatein the development of PRO criteria in their local areas.<ITAG tagnum="81"> 5. Administrative costs</ITAG> One commenter stated that providers should receive an increase in theirDRG-based payment rates to offset the administrative costs of these proposedregulations. In response, the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment rates were derivedby applying the Medicare cost-to-charge ratio to CHAMPUS charges. To theextent that Medicare <T3>costs</T3> include the administrative costs to hospitals of MedicarePRO review, the derived CHAMPUS costs would include them as well.<ITAG tagnum="84"> IV. Specific Provisions of Final Rule</ITAG> A. Payment and Liability for Certain Potentially Excludable Services (andSection;199.4(h)) The Conference Report on the Fiscal Year 1989 Department of Defense AppropriationsAct, H. Conf. Rept, No. 100-1002, 100th Cong., 2d. Session 34, called forthe Department to ``issue directives/ regulations governing cases in whichthe PRO determines that medically unnecessary or inappropriate care hasbeen provided.'' Specifically, the conferees said ``the Department shouldprovide a waiver of liability, especially for beneficiaries, similar tothat provided under the Medicare program.'' Our proposed rule included a provision to provide relief for both a providerand beneficiary providing or accepting services potentially excludableon the grounds of being not medically necessary or provided at an inappropriatelevel.<ITAG tagnum="81"> 1. Institutional responsibility</ITAG> We received several comments suggesting that institutional providers couldnot reasonably be expected to know that services provided could be consideredto be not medically necessary, since all services are ordered by a physician,and thus institutional providers should never be held liable. We disagree.Hospitals, through their utilization review and quality assurance committees,continually make decisions about medical necessity and appropriateness.The PRO criteria are developed by area physicians and are disseminatedto all hospitals and physicians prior to the start of review. The hospitalis, and always has been, held responsible for care provided in its facility.The PRO review is an adjunct to the responsible hospital committees andshould help to assure CHAMPUS beneficiaries receive the most appropriateand highest quality of medical care. In addition, hospital liability asdefined here, is similar to that under the Medicare program.<ITAG tagnum="81"> 2. Presumptive status</ITAG>Another comment expressed concern regarding our lack of a favorable presumptivestatus for hospitals under the CHAMPUS limitation of liability provision.Although the Medicare PRO program originally contained a favorable presumptivestatus for hospitals, Medicare found it to be ineffective and has discontinuedit. We will follow the current Medicare policy and make decisions as towhether a beneficiary or provider had reason to know services were excludableby reason of not being medically necessary on a case-by-case basis. Againthis consistency with the established and experienced Medicare peer reviewsystem results in minimal disruptive impact on providers and peer revieworganizations.Consistent with the proposed rule, under the final rule, where both theprovider and the beneficiary did not know, and had no reason to know, thatthe services would be considered to be not medically necessary, CHAMPUSpayment would be made. However, in making such a payment the provider andpatient will be put on notice that the type of service under those circumstancesis excludable. In subsequent cases involving similar situations, no paymentwill be made. In cases in which the provider, but not the beneficiary, knew or couldreasonably have been expected to know that the services were excludable,CHAMPUS will not pay and the provider may not require the beneficiary topay either the amount CHAMPUS disallowed or the usual beneficiary costshare amount. In such cases, the provider would be told that the providercould seek reconsideration of the PRO's decision both as to the medicalnecessity of the services and the provider's knowledge. <ITAG tagnum="81"> 3. Criteria for determining knowledge</ITAG> The final rule is consistent with the proposed rule in adopting a setof criteria for determining whether beneficiaries and providers know orshould have known that services were excludable. These criteria are substantiallythe same as those applicable to Medicare under 42 CFR 405.334 and 405.336,and are intended to establish the same substantive standards as are followedunder Medicare. The limitation of liability only applies to cases in which the hospitalservices portion is covered by the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system (althoughthe payment and liability rules apply to both  institutional and individualproviders involved in care) and in which a determination was made by thePRO that the care rendered was not medically necessary. B. Limitation on Charges to Beneficiaries for Continued Hospital Stays(andSection;199.14 (a)(1)(iv)(B)(4)) Consistent with the proposed rule, the final rule establishes a limitationon charges (other than the normal cost sharing amount) to beneficiariesfor continued hospital stays. These provisions are part of a process toassure that patients are not prematurely discharged and that providersare making appropriate discharge decisions.Under this process, if the hospital determines that a patient no longerneeds inpatient hospital care, the hospital will seek the agreement ofthe patient's attending physician. If the attending physician does notagree, the hospital may request immediate review by the PRO. If the hospitalobtains the agreement of either the attending physician or the PRO, thehospital will then give the beneficiary written notice of the hospital'sintention to proceed with the discharge and that if the patient prefersto remain in the hospital, the patient will be responsible for the chargesfor continued care beyond the second day following the date of the notice.This two-day period is intended to give the beneficiary the opportunityto request immediate PRO review without risk of financial responsibilityfor those two days of care. If the PRO review determines that continuedinpatient services are needed, the beneficiary will not be charged forthose additional services. It is only in cases in which the PRO agreeswith the hospital determination that the further hospitalization is notnecessary that the beneficiary can be charged for the continued services,and then only beginning the third day after the required notice.One commenter stated that the two-day period would not provide the PROenough time to complete the review requested by the beneficiary, thus placingthe beneficiary at financial risk. In response to this, we have added aprovision to the final rule to clarify the hospital's responsibility tofacilitate very prompt PRO review in cases in which a beneficiary who isstill an inpatient requests a review. If the patient's request is madeprior to noon of the first working day after the date of receipt of thenotice, the hospital is required to provide the records necessary for thePRO review by the close of business that day. If the hospital fails todo this, then that day, and any subsequent days in which the hospital continuesto fail to provide the records, will not count against the patient's two-dayperiod. This clarification in our final rule is to make our proceduressimilar to those of the Medicare PRO program, including the requirementsof 42 U.S.C. 1320C-3(e).C. Pro ProceduresConsistent with the proposed rule, the final rule includes a set of proceduresfor the PRO program and a number of clarifications to our existing regulations.These are summarized below.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. ``Peer Review Organization program'' (andSection; 199.14(a)(1)(iv))</ITAG>The ``Peer Review Organization program'' is adopted as the title for theprogram.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Beneficiary information (andSection; 199.14(a)(1)(iv)(B)(</ITAG><T3>1</T3>))This clarifies that Medicare's documentation requirements regarding thePRO program information that hospitals must provide to beneficiaries alsoapplies to CHAMPUS. The information hospitals must give beneficiaries informsthem of their rights in connection with the PRO program, including theprocedure to seek PRO review of any quality problems.One commenter suggested that the proposed rule was unclear regarding thehospital's administrative process for the ``Important Message from CHAMPUS.''In response, we will follow the Medicare requirements related to the hospital'sresponsibility to assure that each CHAMPUS beneficiary receives the ``Message''at or shortly after admission. PROs will review for compliance with thisrequirement based on Medicare's review procedure.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Physician attestation and acknowledgement (andSection; 199.14(a)(1)(iv)(B)(</ITAG><T3>2</T3>))The final rule clarifies that the attestation and acknowledgment statementrequirements for Medicare also apply to CHAMPUS and that the same statementsmay be used. This provision clarifies the reference to these statementsin the current CHAMPUS regulation at andSection; 199.14(a)(1)(iv)(C)(<T3>2</T3>)(<T3>iii</T3>).One commenter suggested that providers must be given ample time to obtainCHAMPUS specific physician attestation and acknowledgement forms. The requirementsfor attestation and acknowledgement statements were implemented as partof the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system effective with publication of thefinal rule September l, 1987. As a follow-up, we are systematically distributingfurther instructions to providers regarding this requirement.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. M.O.U. required (andSection; 199.14(a)(1)(iv)(B)(</ITAG><T3>3</T3>))This clarifies that, as under Medicare, hospitals must execute a memorandumof understanding with the PRO providing appropriate procedures for thePRO program.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Authority to deny payment (andSection; 199.14(a)(1)(iv)(D)(</ITAG><T3>1</T3>)(<T3>i</T3>))This clarifies the authority to deny payment for unnecessary services.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. DRG validation (andSection; 199.14(a)(1)(iv)(D)(</ITAG><T3>3</T3>))This clarifies authority to correct coding errors and make appropriatepayment adjustments in connection with DRG validation activities of thePRO.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Procedures for initial determinations and reconsiderations (andSection;199.14(a)(1)(iv) (E) and (F))</ITAG>Consistent with the proposed rule, the final rule adopts procedures forinitial determinations and reconsiderations by PROs identical to thosethat apply under Medicare. These procedures provide fair process for bothbeneficiaries and providers and are most appropriate for the CHAMPUS PROprogram. Also following the Medicare example, PRO reconsidered determinationsare final for providers but generally appealable for beneficiaries.One commenter stated that providers should be able to appeal PRO denialdeterminations to OCHAMPUS.We believe it more appropriate to follow the model Congress establishedfor Medicare regarding the finality of PRO reconsidered determinationsfor providers. As under the Medicare PRO program, the procedures give providersample opportunity to participate in the decisionmaking process and confidencein the accuracy of the fact finding. These procedures include an opportunityto discuss the matter with the PRO physician advisor prior to the initialdetermination and a full reconsideration. <ITAG tagnum="81">8. Appeals and hearings (andSection; 199.14(a)(1)(iv)(G)) </ITAG>This provision clarifies that beneficiary appeals and hearings when a PROupholds an adverse determination on reconsideration is handled in the samemanner beneficiary appeals and hearings are generally handled under existingCHAMPUS procedures, which are at andSection; 199.10 of the CHAMPUS regulation.It further clarifies that PRO reconsiderations will be treated as the proceduralequivalent to a formal review determination under the normal CHAMPUS appealsand hearings procedures. <ITAG tagnum="81">9. Acquisition, protection and disclosure of peer review information(andSection; 199.14(a)(1)(iv)(H)) </ITAG>Consistent with the proposed rule, the final rule adopts for the CHAMPUSPRO program the same rules and procedures for acquisition, protection anddisclosure of peer review information as the PROs are currently followingfor Medicare. The only exception is the Medicare PRO provision for penalties,which is dependent upon a Medicare specific statutory provision that cannotbe adopted for CHAMPUS without a specific statutory basis. We believe inthis regard that our existing contractual authority over the PROs providesa sufficient deterrent to abuses. One commenter felt it would be a ``gross error'' to adopt Medicare policyon the disclosure to institutional providers of quality problems and potentialquality problems involving individual providers. The Medicare proceduresfor disclosing individual practitioners' quality problems to an institutionalprovider are based on the general notion that hospitals have a keen responsibilityregarding the quality of care provided in their facilities. If an individualpractitioner provides inadequate care, the hospital should be aware ofthat and should take appropriate corrective steps. <ITAG tagnum="81">10. Additional provisions regarding confidentiality of records andlimitations on liability of participants (andSection; 199.14(a)(1)(iv)(I))</ITAG>Consistent with the proposed rule, the final rule sets forth our interpretationthat 10 U.S.C. 1102 applies to the CHAMPUS PRO program as it does to theexternal peer review activity that reviews medical care provided in militaryhospitals. This section of law, enacted as part of the National DefenseAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987, Pub. L. 99-661, section 705(a),assures the confidentiality of medical quality assurance records createdby or for the Department of Defense for the purpose of assessing the qualityof medical care and limits the civil liability of participants in qualityassurance activities. Although CHAMPUS had not, at the time this provisionwas enacted, yet announced plans to implement an external civilian peerreview program, the external civilian peer review program for militaryhospitals was then being developed. It is DoD's interpretation that 10U.S.C. 1102 applies to both external civilian PRO programs (in additionto its application to internal quality assurance programs of military hospitals).Some commenters expressed a bit of confusion regarding the interactionof these section 1102 provisions and the confidentiality requirements of42 CFR Part 476, which we are also adopting. Although the two sets of provisionsare extremely similar in purpose, thrust and underlying policy, there aresome differences that make a degree of confusion understandable. Therefore,we have revised the final rule to characterize the statement of section1102 applicability to the CHAMPUS PRO program, as it appeared in the proposedrule, as the ``general rule''. We then added several ``specific applications''we hope will clarify the interaction. The first specific application focuses on the PRO deliberative processwhich is the core thesis of both sets of confidentiality protections. Itstates that PRO deliberations are generally nondisclosable under section1102. The second specific application clarifies that with respect to administrativedeterminations by PROs regarding medical necessity, DRG validation, andsimilar utilization review functions, the section 1102 protections forquality assurance deliberations and related activities do not apply. Thus,providers or beneficiaries seeking reconsideration of these PRO determinationswill receive a full statement of reasons for the PRO action; this reconsideration/appealprocess is not affected by section 1102. Finally, the third specific applicationwe added to the final rule clarifies that section 1102 is not violatedby release of information that is the subject of mandatory PRO disclosureunder 42 CFR Part 476. Because the purposes and terms of section 1102 arefully compatable with those of 42 CFR Part 476, it is our interpretationthat the normal PRO disclosures, that have been carefully crafted to fitthe specific day-to day operations of the PRO program for civilian hospitals,are all authorized by section 1102. <ITAG tagnum="81">11. Obligations, sanctions and procedures (andSection; 199.14(a)(1)(iv)(J))</ITAG>Consistent with the proposed rule, the final rule establishes a processfor making sanction recommendations to OCHAMPUS for cases identified underthe CHAMPUS PRO program. This sanction process adopts the substantive standardsand PRO procedures applicable to Medicare. Thus, the final rule incorporatesby reference obligations of providers to provide and document medicallynecessary, quality care as required under Medicare. Further, it adoptsthe same substantive grounds for sanctions as Congress has adopted forMedicare. Additionally, PROs will, as they do for Medicare, give providersthe opportunity for discussions and make sanctions recommendations. However,whereas under Medicare such recommendations are made to the HHS InspectorGeneral, Sanctions recommendations under CHAMPUS will be made to OCHAMPUSand will be handled in accordance with normally applicable sanction casehearings procedures under the CHAMPUS program. In considering our sanctionprocess, we are mindful of the much more limited size of our PRO program,the likely low number of sanctions cases and the current expansive roleof HHS in identifying providers that should be excluded from Federal reimbursementprograms. We expect to confer with HHS, as appropriate, to avoid duplicationof effort in connection with potentially sanctionable matters of interestto both Medicare and CHAMPUS. D. Effective DateWe included in the proposed rule a special provision regarding the effectivedate of the final rule. We said we intended for the final rule to takeeffect April 1, 1989, insofar as it established any new requirements onproviders, beneficiaries or the public. We noted, however, that becausethe PRO program was already operational (under our September 1, 1987 finalrule), we should reassure all interested parties that insofar as the proposedrule set forth practices of the Department or our PROs, these practiceswere in effect since the program became operational. Some commenters indicated confusion about the effective date of the finalrule and requested clarification. For example, the proposed rule confusedsome commenters on whether the rules on limiting liability for certainpotentially excludable services were to apply to care provided prior toApril 1 if the PRO review takes place after April 1. The suggestions for clarification are well taken. We are revising the finalrule to establish a simple effective date: The final rule becomes effectivefor hospital admissions that occur on or after April 8, 1989. To clarifythe application of this effective date, PROs will not make any formal initialdeterminations that services provided prior to April 8 were not medicallynecessary. Regarding such services provided prior to April 8, PROs willissue notices that are purely advisory. These advisory notices will alerthospitals that the services provided in that case, were they provided afterApril 8, would be subject to exclusion. In addition, PRO sanctions willnot be based on services provided prior to April 8.It should be understood, however, that pre-existing PRO procedures arenot affected by the new rule's effective date. For example, although thisrule includes provisions protecting the confidentiality of records, PROswill protect the confidentiality of records regarding all reviews, includingthose which took place prior to April 8. This is because the PROs wereobliged under their  contractual relationship (prior to April 8) with DoDto assure confidentiality. As another example, PRO authorities, such asperforming DRG validations, that were established by the final rule ofSeptember 1, 1987, continue in effect. Thus, the April 8 effective dateis only with respect to new authorities and requirements. We think this should clear up the confusion regarding the effective dateof this final rule. To recap, the requirements of this rule apply onlyto activities that occur after April 8. Activities that occurred priorto April 8, 1989, are governed by the rules, procedures and authoritieswhich were in effect prior to April 8.One final clarification regarding this issue is necessary. We indicatedin the proposed rule that, pending a final rule that would limit beneficiaries'liability when they did not know or have reason to know that a servicewould be found by the PROs to be not medically necessary, we wanted toassure that beneficiaries not be held liable for any services determinedby the PRO prior to April 1 to have been not medically necessary. In orderto have this assurance, we proposed to deem all such services as qualifyingfor payment during an interim period. We stated that ``this is similarto the approach initially taken by PROs under Medicare.'' This statementwas not correct. In fact, under the Medicare program, PROs were able toapply the Medicare limitation of liability provisions at the start of theprogram. Therefore, Medicare beneficiaries and providers were protectedif they did not know or have reason to know that services would be foundto be not medically necessary.<ITAG tagnum="84"> V. Regulatory Procedures</ITAG> A. Paperwork Reduction Act This notice does not impose new information collection requirements. Therefore,it does not need to be reviewed pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Actof 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3511). B. E.O. 12291 and the Regulation Flexibility Act This final rule is not a major rule for the purposes of Executive Order12291. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is hereby certifiedthat this final rule will not have a significant impact on small businessentities. In the proposed rule, we indicated that this rule will not have a significantimpact on small business entities since it does not establish new coveragerules or payment methods, but merely establishes procedures for effectuatingbasic requirements of quality care and medical necessity. Further, theprocedures are very similar to procedures providers are currently followingunder Medicare. We, therefore concluded that the rule does not involvesignificant impact on providers. One commenter suggested that for some small hospitals, the disallowanceof a single hospital claim can produce a major impact, and thus our RegulatoryFlexibility Act conclusions should be revised. In response, the RegulatoryFlexibility Act does not address itself to every regulatory effect on everysmall entity. In any event, because these requirements already apply tothe Medicare program, which is much larger than CHAMPUS, and because thesereasonable requirements establish no significant burdens, we continue tobelieve we are imposing no substantial impacts. In an effort to roughly quantify the potential impact on providers ofour PRO program, of which this proposed rule is a part, we took note ofthe Medicare experience regarding the number of cases for which the PROsdenied payment. On the basis of these denial rates and the projected percentageof CHAMPUS claims the PROs will review, we anticipate a CHAMPUS revenueimpact arising from the PRO program to be well under $10 million per year.Thus, we conclude that this final rule does not involve significant impactson providers.<ITAG tagnum="84"> VI. Conclusions</ITAG> This final rule, refined as a result of a number of valuable comments,establishes what we believe are reasonable and appropriate requirementsand procedures for assuring the quality and appropriateness of health careservices under CHAMPUS. These requirements and procedures, modeled closelyafter those applicable to Medicare, supplement the established rules forthe CHAMPUS PRO program, promulgated in 1987. By ``piggy-backing'' on Medicare,we believe we are maximizing effectiveness and minimizing disruption andburden on hospitals. The CHAMPUS PRO program, as invigorated by this finalrule, is a critically important component of DoD's strong commitment toimprove CHAMPUS.<ITAG tagnum="84"> List of Subjects in 32 CFR Part 199</ITAG> Claims, Handicapped, Health insurance, Military personnel.<ITAG tagnum="52"> PART 199_[AMENDED]</ITAG> Accordingly, 32 CFR Part 199 is amended as follows: The authority citation continues to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4> Authority:</T4> 10 U.S.C. 1079, 1086, 1102, 5 U.S.C. 301.</ITAG> 1.
