Peres, emerging from an hour-long meeting with Shultz prior to acall on President Reagan, said U.S. officials told him the Sovietshad increased to 1,400 the monthly exit permits given to Jewswishing to emigrate.   ``There is no doubt'' that one can learn from that about``increased Soviet liberalism'' toward the U.S.-orchestrated peaceplan for Arab-Israeli talks, Peres told reporters.   The Soviet role in the peace plan will be a topic at thesuperpower summit in Moscow later this month, Peres said, addingthat he and Shultz had devoted their entire talk to the Kremlin'sposition.   Peres said he had told the Soviets at meetings last week inSpain and in Hungary that ``they have to do more and in a moredetermined fashion'' to boost the flagging peace initiative.   ``I told them that their fear of the Arab reaction isexaggerated because the Arabs need peace talks no less than wedo,'' he said. The Soviets have expressed concern privately thattheir radical Arab allies might be angry if they joined the peaceprocess.   Syria, a close ally of Moscow's, rejects the Shultz plan but themore moderate Jordan has said it welcomes Soviet participation.   Peres said he had been told in his talks here that the Sovietshave expressed concern about the proliferation ofsurface-to-surface missiles in the Mideast in the wake ofrevelations that Saudi Arabia had bought such rockets from China.The United States and Israel have criticized the clandestine Saudipurchase of the intermediate-range CSS-2 missiles.   Reagan is expected to try and infuse the Shultz plan with newlife after the mid-April deadline for its implementation passedwith neither Israel nor Jordan making up their minds whether toreject or accept it.   Reagan, who has warned Israel and Jordan against rejecting thepeace plan, is expected to stress his view that the U.S. blueprintis the only solution to the five-month rebellion in which 180Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops.   But neither side held out much hope that Reagan would be able tobudge the plan initiated earlier this year by Secretary of StateGeorge Shultz.   ``There are several new ideas, but they're minor and we don'texpect great progress,'' said a senior Israeli official, who spokeon condition of anonymity. He declined to discuss the ideas, sayingthey were not meaningful in the short run ``but incremental in thebig plan.''   Peres explored these ideas with Shultz at a meeting Monday andwas to continue discussions with him at two sessions today. Shultzwill bring Peres' ideas to Jordan and Egypt when he visits theregion on his fourth peace shuttle of the year starting June 3.   Peres supports the Shultz plan, which calls for Arab-Israelipeace talks to be held under the auspices of the five permanentmembers of the U.N. Security Council _ the United States, SovietUnion, China, England and France.   But his rival in Israel's fractious governing coalition, PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir, has rejected the formula out of concernthat the five powers would pressure Israel into relinquishing landsit captured from the Arabs in the 1967 Mideast war.   General elections scheduled in Israel for November are expectedto serve as a referendum on the plan.   Underscoring support for his stand, leading administrationofficials attended a luncheon in Peres' honor hosted by IsraeliAmbassador Moshe Arad. The guest list included Shultz _ who toastedPeres' ``creativity'' in searching for peace formulas _ as well asDefense Secretary Frank Carlucci, White House chief of staff HowardBaker and Senate leaders.</TEXT></DOC>
