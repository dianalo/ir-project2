The strong meson-nucleon form factors which determinethe nucleon-nucleon potential are obtained as functions of the squareof the momentum transfer of the meson. A comparison is made with thephenomenological form factors used to describe the phase shifts for NNscattering in models of single-boson exchange.</TEXT></DOC>
