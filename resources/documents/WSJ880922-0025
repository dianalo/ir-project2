Meanwhile, talks between the bank and New York City regarding an alternative site in the city intensified. Edward Koch, New York's mayor, met with Willard C. Butcher, Chase's chairman, on Tuesday, laying out details of a site in Brooklyn. Further talks are expected.    As previously reported, Chase is weighing moving its operations and technical employees to Newport, a Jersey City real estate development. The move, which would save Chase millions of dollars in rent and related costs, would be the biggest corporate defection in New York in years. However, New York City is making a feverish attempt to persuade Chase to keep the 5,000 employees within city limits.    New York offers savings on taxes and energy to companies who move to boroughs outside Manhattan. The city is trying to persuade Chase to move to Metrotech, a city-sponsored office development in Brooklyn that is part of an effort to rejuvenate the borough's downtown.    Costs in Brooklyn are said to be roughly competitive with those in New Jersey, but the bank is worried about security in Brooklyn. The Chase employees to be moved work in three shifts and include many employees who must travel in the predawn hours.    New York is supplying Chase with details of security in the area. &quot;The security plan is solid,&quot; a city spokesman said.    Newport is the largest of several real estate projects rising on the New Jersey shore of the Hudson with the aim of luring businesses from Manhattan.    Lawyers for the Lefrak Organization, which is building Newport, and lawyers for Chase have been negotiating terms for Chase to build a 1.5 million square feet building there. </TEXT></DOC>
