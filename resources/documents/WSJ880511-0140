Bulldozing such a site in Parkersburg, W.Va., years ago, construction workers heard the ground begin to crackle and pop. Earth-moving machinery, seemingly spontaneously, burst into flame.    It was radioactive waste that did it. Buried there -- and in thousands of other industrial graveyards -- is the deadly detritus of America's past manufacturing might: ordinary metals, isotopes, acids, organic compounds and solvents that can destroy men as well as machines. Among the wastes are substances that can cause leukemia, other cancers and diseases of the heart, liver and nervous systems.    This is real estate you won't see pictured in the annual report. Nor are you likely to find on the balance sheet the liability it now represents.    Federal law says to clean up the dumps. Companies are trying, and some smaller and weaker ones are going broke in the process. The cost? By several estimates, perhaps $100 billion or more, an amount greater than the combined 1987 profits of the Fortune 500.    Manufacturers are trying to stick their insurance men with the bill, and they cite the uncertainty of their liability for their failure to account for it in their financial statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission and independent accountants, however, are beginning to have misgivings. To auditors wrestling with the question of withholding or qualifying their opinions of corporate financial statements, says a partner at Ernst andamp; Whinney, &quot;It's a matter of great concern.&quot;    SEC staffers have just begun examining corporate cleanup disclosures. Although no SEC crackdown seems imminent, the staffers are unhappy with what they see -- and what they don't see. At the least, says Howard Hodges, chief accountant for the agency's corporate-finance division, the companies should disclose the minimum cost of cleanup. Few if any are doing so.    Westinghouse Electric Corp. seems typical. A lawyer for insurance companies Westinghouse is suing says the company faces hundreds of millions of dollars in potential cleanup costs. But a Westinghouse spokesman says an estimate would be &quot;premature.&quot; In its most recent &quot;10-K&quot; filing with the SEC, the company expresses its belief that the cost will have, in accounting boilerplate, no &quot;material adverse effect.&quot; It does observe that &quot;there can be no assurance that, by reason of future developments, the company will not hereafter incur material costs and liabilities.&quot; No figures are mentioned.    Allied-Signal Inc. is even less explicit. Its most recent annual report acknowledges &quot;environmental&quot; claims. In its 10-K, the company says it expects actual environmental outlays of $30 million to $40 million in each of the next two years. It makes no mention of 100 sites that give rise to unstated liabilities. The company &quot;wouldn't know the extent of its liabilities until further down the road,&quot; a spokesman says.    The EPA figures it might cost an average of $25 million each to clean up polluted sites, but for the most troublesome, the agency says, the cost could reach $100 million each. The EPA has identified 27,000 sites -- suggesting a total cleanup bill in the hundreds of billions. But EPA assistant administrator J. Winston Porter observes that &quot;society won't be willing to spend that kind of money.&quot; He puts the ultimate cost of neutralizing the most hazardous sites at $50 billion to $100 billion.    After 30 years of manufacturing paint pigments, Bofors Nobel Inc., though profitable to the end, last year was forced to liquidate by the cost of cleaning up a single site, the 68 wooded acres behind its plant in Muskegon, Mich. The company, formerly known as Lakeway Chemical Co., was controlled by Swedish Nobel Industries. A government-ordered cleanup would have cost Bofors $60 million, more than twice its annual sales. Dozens of other small companies, in similar straits, also folded last year.    The source of the grief is the 1980 environmental &quot;Superfund&quot; law, tightened in 1986. Because toxic wastes from many sites are seeping into ground water, the EPA is vigorously pressing the owners to clean up. The law permits the EPA to sue to compel a cleanup, or do the job itself and force the owners to pay. &quot;The law gives the EPA a lot of leverage, and we want to use it,&quot; says Mr. Porter.    Wall Street has yet to confront the potential damage. Few securities analysts have closely examined it. &quot;The companies don't give the impression that the problems are insurmountable,&quot; says Robert Reitzes, who follows the chemical industry for Mabon, Nugent andamp; Co. Leonard Bogner, of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., says more ominously: &quot;Companies aren't ready to share that kind of information, but I think the potential liabilities will become critical one day.&quot;    Mr. Hodges says that if he were a shareholder, &quot;I would be peeved if I didn't know that my company had so many sites to clean up.&quot; Even disclosing the number, he says, might be inadequate, because &quot;that wouldn't tell me how much money would be taken out of my company.&quot;    SEC staffers say it is hard to determine whether companies have knowingly withheld material information about their liabilities. &quot;We don't go out and inspect sites,&quot; says Howard Morin, whose staff reviews management analyses in corporate annual reports. &quot;We rely considerably on the companies' independent auditors.&quot; The SEC's current disclosure study, he says, is mainly intended to develop disclosure guidelines, but &quot;flagrant violations&quot; of existing disclosure rules &quot;will be referred for enforcement action.&quot;    The site owners are spending millions of dollars in a legal effort to lay off the cost on their insurers. If they succeed, &quot;Crum andamp; Forster will disappear,&quot; says Leslie Cheek, senior vice president of the casualty underwriter, a subsidiary of Xerox Corp. Crum andamp; Forster, with premiums of $4.5 billion a year, is the country's 13th largest property-casualty insurer. &quot;Most {insurance} companies view this exposure as the most serious economic problem in the 1990s,&quot; Mr. Cheek says.    &quot;If the insurance industry gets stuck with even a quarter of the estimated cleanup costs,&quot; says Andre Maisonpierre, president of the Reinsurance Association of America, it will cause &quot;major insolvencies.&quot;    Shell Oil Co. and its insurers spent $40 million fighting the EPA before Shell agreed early this year to clean up the site of a Denver pesticide plant. Though Shell hasn't estimated the total cost, the Royal Dutch Petroleum unit now is obliged to pay $320 million of the first $700 million and 20% of the cost above that. The Army, which once made chemical weaponry on the site, will pay the rest.    Shell is seeking an out. It has sued its 300 insurers to pay the cost. Westinghouse has sued about 150 current and former insurers to force them to accept the liability for cleaning up 80 sites. United Technologies Corp. and 250 insurance companies are also in court over 150 sites. So are Allied-Signal, with its 100-plus sites, and Monsanto Co., with 40.    The insurance companies say their comprehensive liability policies now at issue cover only &quot;sudden and accidental&quot; events, such as the lethal gas leak from Union Carbide's plant in Bhopal, India, in 1984. If the insurers have their way, new policies will specifically exclude liability from pollution. In seven states, however, civil antitrust charges have been filed against insurers attempting to impose this exclusion.    Because of the big money at stake, and the number of insurers involved, the Shell Oil suit alone has created a small industry. Trial is taking place in the converted auditorium of an old high-school building near San Francisco. The county court was too small for lawyers from 30 firms, their support staffs and equipment. &quot;The cost of litigation itself, I'm confident, will exceed $50 million,&quot; says Thorn Rosenthal, a Shell attorney.    Bankers have inherited a number of sites -- with liabilities attached -- from improvident borrowers. Some are already getting stuck with cleanup bills, a matter of concern at the office of the Comptroller of the Currency. John Noonan, director of commercial activities for the office, has assigned bank examiners to assess the problem.    Mellon National Bank in Pittsburgh says it faced cleanup costs in 1985 in an undisclosed amount when it began to manage the affairs of a borrower in default, Turco Coatings Inc., of Phoenixville, Pa. Midlantic National Bank of New Jersey, Landmark Bank of St. Louis and Maryland Bank andamp; Trust Co. report similar misadventures. Mellon says it now takes an &quot;environmental audit&quot; of loan customers and forecloseable property.    National Bank of Fredericksburg, Va., last year chose to forfeit $200,000 it had lent a small firm; the company, in bankruptcy, faced a $2.2 million cleanup bill. &quot;We don't intend to foreclose such properties,&quot; says Nancy Embrey, a senior loan officer.    Manufacturers driven into bankruptcy court denounce enforcement as uneconomic and brutal.    &quot;The EPA doesn't care; it's the least of their worries,&quot; says Donald Wilson, whose Denver-based Protex Industries declared bankruptcy last December after 67 years in business. The company, founded by his father, began as a purveyor of lubricating oil and grease. After World War II, it supplied chemicals to increase the durability of concrete that built the Grand Coulee Dam and many highways and airport runways.    The company packaged its products in reconditioned used drums, which often arrived at the plant containing half an inch of oil or weed killer. Protex workers would dump the contents on a five-acre site behind the plant. &quot;That was long before paved streets came into town, and before the EPA,&quot; says the 62-year-old Mr. Wilson. After the EPA came into existence in 1970, he says, his company built a holding tank for the residue in the backyard.    On March 10, 1986, EPA agents, who had taken samples from the site, raided the company headquarters. Accompanied by six police cars, FBI agents and fire trucks -- in all, 72 law-enforcement officials -- they cordoned off the plant, Mr. Wilson says. Last December, after a lengthy trial in which he and his firm were convicted of willfully polluting the land, Protex closed its doors. The company, which had $11 million in annual sales, must still pay $7.1 million to clean up the site.    &quot;I felt I was in Nazi Germany or communist Russia,&quot; says Mr. Wilson.    &quot;I very strongly disagree with that kind of characterization,&quot; says Robert Duprey, EPA's director of hazardous-waste management in Denver. He adds: &quot;The area is very heavily contaminated, and we found the company had been lying to our inspectors&quot; -- a charge Mr. Wilson denies. </TEXT></DOC>
