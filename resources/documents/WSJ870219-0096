CarrollStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/19/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> NSC U PIETENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)AIRLINES (AIR)TRANSPORTATION, TRUCK AND SHIP LINES, RAILROADS (TRA) </IN><TEXT>   Even as Norfolk Southern Corp. is taking the bold step of trying to swallow Piedmont Aviation Inc., the big railroad company is juggling chief executives.    At the same time that Norfolk Southern is seeking to make the recently proposed acquisition, valued at a minimum of $981 million, its chairman and chief executive officer, Robert B. Claytor, is getting ready to retire Feb. 28. He will be succeeded by Arnold B. McKinnon, whose scheduled move into the top jobs Dec. 31 was delayed by his heart bypass surgery in early January.    Though USAir Group Inc. weighed in yesterday with a higher bid for Piedmont that might develop into an extended fight for the parent of Piedmont Airlines, those who know Messrs. Claytor and McKinnon and Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern say they should be able to minimize the confusion as well as anyone could. They note that Mr. Claytor, who will remain a director, and Mr. McKinnon both come from the same long tradition of railroading and that it has been Norfolk Southern's policy for some years to seek diversification and to find a way to spend a cash hoard that totaled $724 million at the end of 1986.    Mr. Claytor, who will turn 65 years old at the end of the month, has been in railroads since 1951. He is a certified and practicing train engineer -- meaning he occasionally drives a train -- and his brother Graham runs Amtrak. Mr. McKinnon, 59, also has been in railroads since 1951. He had a grandfather who founded a railroad, and his father ran the line. Both executives are lawyers and rose through the legal ranks at the company.    Messrs. Claytor and McKinnon both fit in with Norfolk Southern's reputation as a well-managed but sleepy company that seemed to run by gravity -- it sent empty rail cars up the Appalachian hills to the coal mines and then let full ones roll back down.    &quot;I guess the company can be legitimately described as the best-run railroad in the U.S., very tough, very lean,&quot; says John Sweeney, a senior vice president at CSX Inc., a major competitor. &quot;They've done a marvelous job of controlling costs while at the same time maintaining what I would consider an admirable revenue base.&quot;    The problem has been figuring out how to spend the cash the railroad generates. Last year, Norfolk Southern acquired North American Van Lines Inc., a trucking company, and it fought for three years to buy Conrail. But the Conrail plan fell through, and Norfolk Southern itself became the subject of occasional takeover rumors because of its cash holdings. At the same time, other railroads and transportation companies have been making acquisitions to expand the range of their transportation services, trying to provide a sort of one-stop shopping.    &quot;The global village concept creates pressure for fast and efficient transportation world-wide (and) market forces favor consolidation of modes under one management for improved efficiency and service,&quot; Mr. McKinnon said in a speech in November.    Analysts say the benefits of combining an airline and a railroad are less certain than the benefits of combining railroads with shipping companies or trucking lines, as some railroads have done. And they say it remains to be seen whether the people who have managed a railroad so well can learn to manage a conglomerate.    &quot;From conversations I've had with folks who've approached them with ideas, I don't think they have a strategic plan on where they're going,&quot; says Tucker Lamkin, a vice president at Credit Agricole.    Some on Wall Street have speculated that Norfolk Southern is just trying to put Piedmont into play, to get a good price for the almost 20% stake Norfolk Southern has in Piedmont, but many analysts say that wouldn't fit the company's personality.    &quot;This company,&quot; says James Voytko, a transportation analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc., &quot;has always struck me as one where if they say they're going to do something, they do it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
