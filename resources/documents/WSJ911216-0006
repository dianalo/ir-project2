But, in their first nationally televised debate, theypulled out all the stops in attacking President Bush.   Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, the unrepentant liberal among thecandidates, compared &quot;an isolated&quot; George Bush, who &quot;doesn'tunderstand ordinary hard-working Americans,&quot; to the imperiousKing George III of England &quot;and his government of theprivileged few.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, fresh from an easy victoryin a Florida straw poll, called Mr. Bush another Scrooge.But, emphasizing his role as the designated moderate in thelineup, he warned that Democrats can't allow themselves to be&quot;the ghosts of Christmas past. We need to change, too.&quot;   Despite warnings from NBC News' Tom Brokaw, moderator ofthe discursive 90-minute session, not to solicit campaigncontributions, former California Gov. Jerry Brown managed toread out twice a toll-free number that listeners could callto make donations to his campaign.   High drama and memorable one-liners were scarce, but Sen.Bob Kerrey of Nebraska came as close as anyone when he tookumbrage at Mr. Brown's suggestions that he and other membersof Congress are creatures of special interests and politicalaction committee money.   &quot;I resent all this,&quot; Mr. Kerrey, a highly decoratedVietnam veteran, said as he turned to face Mr. Brown. &quot;Areyou saying I'm bought and paid for?&quot; Mr. Brown seemed to backdown. &quot;I'm saying you're part of the system,&quot; he responded.   The other two candidates, former Sen. Paul Tsongas ofMassachusetts and Gov. Doug Wilder of Virginia, tried to stayabove the fray. Mr. Wilder at one point called on everyone tostop talking and listen once again to Mr. Brokaw's questions.   Though the possible candidacy of Gov. Mario Cuomo of NewYork is on the minds of all these Democrats, no one mentionedhis name once during the debate. Mr. Cuomo, still consideringa candidacy, faces a Friday deadline to file for NewHampshire's Feb. 18 primary, the first in the nation.   The debate was staged without an audience, and Mr. Brokawasked all the questions. The discussion covered both domesticand foreign-policy questions, and most of the time no morethan two candidates had an opportunity to answer anyparticular question.   But even in that wide-ranging context, some of thecandidates managed to fashion distinctive appeals.   Mr. Clinton praised President Bush for waging war againstIraq's Saddam Hussein. &quot;We ought to admit that the presidentwas right to kick Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait,&quot; he said.Sen. Kerrey, who managed to note his service in Vietnam on atleast three occasions, took exception. &quot;Governor, I disagreewith you strongly. I'm not prepared to admit that.&quot;   The candidates generally took a hard line against Japan'strade policies. Sen. Harkin said if he were president, hewould tell the Japanese, &quot;we are going to reduce that tradedeficit {with Japan} to zero.&quot;   On helping people in what used to be the Soviet Unionsurvive what promises to be a harsh winter, most of thecandidates opted for humanitarian aid. Sen. Harkin took thetoughest line, opposing large sums in foreign aid. &quot;We oughtto go about developing markets over there,&quot; he said, &quot;so thatwe can start to trade with them in the future.&quot;   On domestic policy, the candidates agreed on the need fora national health-care program and hit hard on backingeconomic policies to help distressed working-class andmiddle-class American taxpayers. But they disagreed on waysto go about it.   Govs. Clinton and Wilder called for a tax cut for themiddle class to give a short-term boost to the saggingeconomy. With the cash, Gov. Clinton said, consumers wouldstart spending again, helping the economy &quot;in places like NewHampshire.&quot;   Sen. Harkin opposed such a tax cut. He pulled a dollarbill out of his pocket and held it before the cameras. All itwould amount to, he said, &quot;is one dollar a day for a family.&quot;His remedy is government-funded public-works projects.   Earlier yesterday, Gov. Clinton recorded a decisivevictory in the Florida straw poll, a result that hisopponents derided as insignificant and that history shows maybe misleading.   Meaningful or not, the Clinton win kicked off a surge ofpolitical activity that culminated with last night's debate.Gov. Clinton garnered 54% of the votes from the activists andparty leaders assembled in Lake Buena Vista across a grassymeadow from Walt Disney World. Sen. Harkin finished second,with 31%, while Sen. Kerrey was a distant third, with 10%.   Such straw votes -- or &quot;beauty contests,&quot; in the parlanceof politics -- are extremely unpredictable indicators ofcandidate strength. This nonbinding poll provided a catapultfor Jimmy Carter a year before the 1976 election. But asimilar event in Wisconsin a year before the 1984 electionwas captured by California Sen. Alan Cranston, whoseperformance in New Hampshire was so weak that more of thestate's Democrats voted for Ronald Reagan than for Mr.Cranston, who vanished from the field soon after.   Because of the unpredictability, campaign staffs conductedstealth drives here, denying they were putting much effortinto the balloting but quietly working for a strong turnout.Mr. Clinton's effort was conducted closest to the delegates'line of vision. Using the convention as a dry run for theFlorida primary on March 10, Mr. Clinton's staff conducted atelephone canvass, hand-delivered 1,000 campaign videos todelegates and mailed 1,300 more to other delegates, anextraordinary commitment for an event that provides nothingbut a symbolic boost.   The Clinton staff assigned one whip for every 10delegates, continually called uncommitted delegates, anddeployed a high-tech crew -- equipped with walkie-talkies,beepers and earphones -- to distribute hundreds of T-shirts,hats and signs. Then Sen. Harkin delivered an emotionalspeech that centered on the struggles of his deaf brother,fired during a union struggle from his job in a jet assemblyplant. Immediately, the Clinton forces set out to scotch amovement of uncommitted delegates, who made up about a thirdof the delegates, to the Iowa senator.   &quot;This caps the first stage of this campaign, showing thatClinton's the class of the field and proving that he can notonly give a good speech but get votes,&quot; said GeorgeStephanopoulos, the deputy campaign manager.   At the same time, Alan Greer, Sen. Harkin's Florida statechairman, said he took comfort from the results, adding:&quot;This shows that Tom Harkin can run in the South.&quot;   Insignificant or not, the three-day session here providedever more reminders that the campaign can't take final shapeuntil Gov. Cuomo decides whether to run.   Though not on the ballot, Mr. Cuomo was on the minds ofdelegates and candidates alike. In a speech Saturday morning,Sen. Kerrey made a mischievous aside about &quot;the governor upnorth,&quot; and no one mistook his reference to mean Gov. HowardDean of Vermont or Gov. Robert Casey of Pennsylvania. WhenFlorida Gov. Lawton Chiles listed the Democratic contenders,he tantalized the delegates by leaving room for Mr. Cuomo.And Bradley McElroy, a 10-month-old baby, was paraded aroundthe convention hall with a &quot;Cuomo for president&quot; sign pinnedto his shirt.   &quot;I've heard Kerrey, Clinton and Harkin,&quot; said delegateJames Clark of Miami, &quot;and I'll wait for Cuomo.&quot; But whenHillsborough County (Tampa) reported that two of itsdelegates wrote in Mr. Cuomo's name, the room swelled withboos.   For all their exertions, the campaigns' strongest effortswere their attempt to play down the significance of the strawpoll.   &quot;I'm a victim of the lessons of 1984 -- that there'sutterly no relation between this and the election,&quot; saidWilliam Shore, a senior counselor to Sen. Kerrey. &quot;For us,the purpose is to take the opportunity to present ourmessage.&quot;   ---                        Straw Poll                                                                                                          Balloting in yesterdays' straw poll of delegates to theFlorida Democratic convention.                                                                                                                                      # OF VOTES     % OF VOTES                                                                                                              Bill Clinton               950             54       Tom Harkin                 549             31       Bob Kerrey                 131             10       Paul Tsongas                32              2       Douglas Wilder              24              1       Mario Cuomo*                21              1       Jerry Brown                  4              0                                                                                                          *Write-in votes   Note: Gov.
