The only non-fossil energy sources which are availablein relevant quantities, are nuclear energy, solar energy and hydropower.The potential of H/sub 2/ for the extensive utilization of solar energyis of particular importance. Status, progress and development potentialof the electrolytic H/sub 2/ production with photovoltaic generators,solar-thermal power plants and nuclear power plants are studied and discussed.The joint German-Saudi Arabian Research, Development and DemonstrationProgram HYSOLAR for the solar hydrogen production and utilization issummarized.
