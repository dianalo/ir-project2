The world's poorest countries are likely to be hit hardest, theexperts said, as higher temperatures destroy traditional crops andspread tropical diseases.   Specialists at a three-day conference on the world's environment,sponsored by the Japanese government, said low-lying countries likeBangladesh could lose up to 20 percent of their land area as sealevels rise. Thousands of Pacific islands could disappear as aresult of melting polar icecaps, they said.   Scientists have predicted the Earth will warm gradually overcoming decades because of an increase of man-made gases in theatmosphere that prevent heat from escaping. The phenomenon is knownas the ``greenhouse effect.''   Dennis Tirpak, director of the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency's Global Climate Change Division, said temperatures arelikely to increase by 3 to 5 degrees and ocean levels could rise upto 6{ feet if current emissions of the gases continue through thenext century.   The gases, primarily carbon dioxide, methane andchlorofluorocarbons, are created by the burning of fossil fuels andindustrial and agricultural processes.   ``The limited financial resources of developing countries in Asiaand the greater dependency of many of these countries on naturalresource production make them especially vulnerable to the impactsof global warming,'' Tirpak said.   In addition, the environment in many developing countries may beparticularly sensitive to climatic changes because of previousdamage from rapid population growth and deforestation, he said.   If current trends continue, global warming will be ``more extremethan anything which has occurred during the period of writtenhistory,'' said Irving Mintzer of the University of Maryland'sCenter for Global Change.   ``The stresses which would result from such a rapid climatechange threaten to undermine the stability of modern civilization,''he said.   Tirpak said rising temperatures could endanger food productionand economic growth in developing Asian nations, where agriculturecontributes up to 80 percent of income and employment.   The sensitivity of rice, Asia's staple food, to hightemperatures, and widespread farming of marginal lands make theregion particularly vulnerable to soaring temperatures, he said.   Rising temperatures also could worsen droughts in India and othernations and cover portions of India's western coast, Bangladesh,Egypt, Indonesia and the Maldives with sea water, officials said.   ``The homes and lives of millions of people living in the deltasof the Ganges, the Nile, the Mekong, the Yangtze and the Mississippicould be at risk,'' Mintzer said.   The 60 officials and specialists participating in the conference,part of a new Japanese environmental initiative, are expected torelease a set of recommendations Wednesday to combat global warmingand protect the environment.</TEXT></DOC>
