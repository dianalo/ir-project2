<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-56-0960 </DOCNO><TEXT>We report a numerical analysis for the combined action of multi-photon(MPHI) and Cascade ionization (CI) processes in producing ionizationand breakdown of molecular oxygen. The calculations were carried outat two different laser pulses of wavelengths 0.6943{mu}m and 0.53{mu}mwith pulse durations 18ps and 25ps respectively, over a pressure rangeof 10/sup 2/-5x10/sup 4/ Torr. A reasonably good agreement has been obtainedbetween the computed threshold intensities and the measured ones. Computationsfor nitrogen irradiated with 0.53{mu}m are also given. This analysisshows that the model is capable to interpret gas breakdown experimentswith short flashes of laser radiation. (author). 6 refs, 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
