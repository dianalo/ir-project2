 We review here some of the mostsuccessful and government-specific microcomputers that made big standard buysan accepted, desirable practice.andM;We set out to spotlight machines that were disproportionately government.andP;  Ineach case outlined here, the government bought an unusually high proportionof the production of the model, and the company made its mark in the computerbusiness by becoming a major supplier of micros to the government.andM;With these criteria in mind, some micro lines with vast numbers in thegovernment, such as IBM PCs, XTs and ATs, and Apple Macintoshes, were notincluded in this discussion of classic government micros.andM;Zenith Z-120andM;The Air Force's contract with Zenith Data Systems to supply Z-120 micros in1983 was an early indication of the extent of interest in micros in thegovernment.andM;At the time, the Air Force estimated that fewer than 10,000 micros might comein under the contract.andP;  When all was said and done, it bought more than40,000.andM;In its era, the Z-120 was an impressive machine.andP;  Equipped with twomicroprocessors, it runs MS-DOS and several versions of CP/M, an 8-bitoperating system popular before MS-DOS dominated the personal computermarket.andM;The Z-120 has a 16-bit Intel Corp. 8088, running at either 5 MHz or 8 MHz,and an 8-bit 8085.andP;  The system has a range of memory configurations: 64K to192K in 64K increments (128K or 192K standard), or 256K to 768K in 256Kincrements, with 256K standard.andP;  A Z-120 GCN examined for this article had768K RAM on the system board.andM;The standard address space of 1M allows 768K RAM for user memory.andP;  Althoughthe Z-120 runs MS-DOS and many popular programs, they must be Z-100 versions.andO;It is not very PC-compatible.andM;It uses a different ROM BIOS and video scheme than standard PCs.andP;  This is whya PC has 640K of user RAM while a Z-120 has 768K.andM;The keyboard has 95 keys, including some keys you will not find today on mostPC keyboards.andM;A total of 13 function keys across the top of the keyboard included F0.andM;Other unusual keys included a Del Line/Ins Line key, and a lighted Reset key,which, when used in combination with the Ctrl key, functioned somewhat likethe Ctrl, Alt, Del key combination on PCs and reset the system.andM;The systems's WD1797 floppy-disk controller from Western Digital Corp. inIrvine, Calif., supports up to four drives, including single- anddouble-sided, single- and double-density 5-1/4- or 8-inch floppy-disk drives.andM;It also supports 5-1/4- or 8-inch internal hard-disk drives.andP;  The unit GCNreceived has a 10M hard drive.andM;The Z-120 has shown some staying power.andP;  The Command and Control SystemsCenter at Tinker Air Force Base, Okla., for example, bought about 50 of theunits when the contract first was awarded.andP;  Betty Wills, a computer analystthere, said the center still uses Z-120s, mostly running WordStar underMS-DOS.andM;The Z-100 series came in two configurations.andP;  The Air Force procured theAll-in-One model, the Z-120, which included an integral 12-inch display, andthe Low-Profile model, the Z-100, which had a separate display.andM;The All-in-One model has a 12-inch diagonal green screen with 25 rows of 80characters.andP;  With a graphics resolution of 640 by 225 pixels, it was notquite EGA but was better than CGA.andM;The Z-120 has two serial ports -- one for connection to a serial printer andthe other for a modem -- a parallel printer port, and a telephone-type jackfor a light pen.andM;Based on dates inside the GCN evaluation unit, we had a 1985 version of theZ-120.andP;  It ran MS-DOS 3.10.andM;Norton Utilities Version 4.0 Sysinfo gave it a 1.8 speed rating compared withan IBM Corp. XT's 1.0.andP;  Norton rated the Zenith Z-248 80286 machine at 8.6compared with an XT.andM;A spreadsheet test that includes recalculation and copying and moving columnsrunning under Lotus Development Corp. 1-2-3 Version 1A, took about 2 minutesand 40 seconds to run on the Z-120 compared with 38.3 seconds on a Z-248running Lotus 1-2-3 Version 2.01.andM;ConvergentandM;WorkstationandM;Back when PCs were still young and before MS-DOS became nearly a householdword, the microcomputer market was wide open and federal agencies bought manykinds of micros.andM;Although many of the early non-MS-DOS micros have faded away, Convergentworkstations have become standard at several federal agencies.andM;Convergent workstations still are used at the Coast Guard and the GeneralServices Administration, surviving the sale of their parent company,Convergent Technologies Inc. of San Jose, Calif., to Unisys Corp. and wideacceptance of MS-DOS.andM;The Army's standard battlefield computer began as a Burroughs Inc. version ofa Convergent workstation before Burroughs merged with Sperry Inc. and becameUnisys Corp.andM;The Coast Guard bought 6,000 Convergent workstations under a 1981requirements contract with C3 Inc. of Herndon, Va.andM;Out of those original workstations, the Coast Guard estimates that 1,500still are used, mostly for word processing and other office-automationfunctions.andM;They run CTOS, a Convergent multi-tasking, multiuser operating system.andM;The original workstation, now called OGEN for older generation, came in theIWS, MWS and AWS series.andP;  The IWS and MWS series had 768K RAM standard andIntel Corp. 8086 processors.andP;  They commonly worked as servers or multiuserhosts.andP;  The AWS series had 512K RAM and either an 8088 or an 8086 processor.andO;These were often user stations.andM;In 1984, the Coast Guard began buying an 80186-based Convergent workstationcalled the NGEN, for new generation.andM;&quot;That 186 is a funny animal, it was really sort of a bridge&quot; between theOGENs and the soon to follow 80286 and 80386 workstations, said Lt.andP;  Cmdr.andO;Scott D. Bair, chief of the Coast Guard Headquarters Systems IntegrationSection.andM;The Coast Guard designated the 186 workstation as its standard terminal.andP;  InJuly 1988, under a new contract with Unisys Corp., which had acquiredConvergent, the Coast Guard began getting the first machines with 286 and 386processors.andP;  These have since been designated the Coast Guard standardworkstation, Bair said.andM;The Coast Guard will use the new Unisys B28 and B38 NGEN workstations ascluster controllers and cluster workstations, some with local hard-diskdrives.andM;Currently running the BTOS II operating system, Version 1.01, the agency isupgrading to Version 2.0.andP;  The upgrade is being hampered somewhat by thearchitecture of the older 186 workstations, which Version 2.0 will notsupport.andM;Because the Convergent workstations were nearly a Coast Guard standard fromday one, MS-DOS compatibility has not been a major issue within the agency.andO;With more than 10,000 standard Convergent workstations in use, nearly one forevery three Coast Guard employees, there are only about 400 Apple/Macintoshor IBM-compatible micros, Bair said.andM;The Coast Guard has had MS-DOS emulators since the days of the IWS series,although they had &quot;very limited capabilities and were at bestCGA-compatible,&quot; Bair said.andM;A new emulator in the works will provide VGA compatibility, extended memorysupport and will run on the Unisys workstations with a performance of a16-MHz 386 running MS-DOS 4.0, he said.andM;Although there is not a &quot;mandated standard&quot; for Convergent workstations atthe General Services Administrator, a contract with C3 Inc. of Herndon, Va.,andO;in July 1984 set the stage for a de facto CT standard, GSA's Mark Millersaid.andP;  Out of 9,000 micros at the agency, 7,300 are CT workstations and 1,700are IBM Corp. PCs or compatibles.andM;Miller is chief of GSA's technical and contracts branch in Washington.andM;The majority of these workstations -- more than 6,200 -- are NGEN systemswith the 80186 processor.andP;  GSA also has nearly 2,000 286 workstations andabout 150 386s, Miller said.andM;As for the original OGEN AWS/IWS series of CT workstations, what Millerdescribed as a &quot;big screen next to a toaster,&quot; GSA still may have somescattered throughout the agency, but most have long since been replaced.andM;The Army has fielded 8,500 modified Unisys B26 workstations in its TacticalArmy Command and Control System.andM;The computers in this program have run BTOS from the start.andM;The units are in a box with handles that weighs 120 pounds.andP;  With keyboard,monitor and other peripherals, it weighs more than 300 pounds.andM;The system originally was envisioned as something one person could carry, butit has put on weight.andM;Grid CompassandM;The Grid Compass is a sleek, 10-pound black box and a computing status symbolof the early 1980s.andM;Status symbols do not come cheap.andP;  These pint-sized machines cost $8,000 ormore when the company introduced them.andP;  You had to be pretty high up to rateone.andM;The Compass was the laptop of choice for many civilian and military agencies.andO;The Navy sent them out on ships to coordinate radar pictures.andM;&quot;We were hesitant to use commercial computers in an environment as hostile asthe one found on Navy ships.andP;  Nevertheless, the computers have performed veryreliably,&quot; John Zouch, a project engineer, said at the time.andM;A tempest version went to Grenada with the Army during the 1983 engagement,establishing a secure link to Fort Bragg in North Carolina.andP;  The President'sCouncil on Integrity and Efficiency used Compasses for field audits of 17federal agencies.andM;It gained notoriety as it became the computer of choice for offices ofinspectors general in many agencies.andP;  Good word-of-mouth among the financialbloodhounds sold a lot of Grids.andM;But the Compass is best known as the first laptop in space.andM;The computer, code-named SPOC for Shuttle Portable On-Board Computer, went upwith the space shuttle on Nov. 28, 1983.andP;  Astronauts used it to calculate andgraphically display their position in space between updates from MissionControl.andM;The Compass was a government computer standout.andP;  A diskless, AC-only machine,it was also one of the few successes for micro bubble memory.andM;Bubble memory faded with smaller, inexpensive hard-disk drives, but in theearly 80s many thought it the storage solution for portable computers.andP;  Whenthe Compass came out, its 384K of non-volatile bubble storage was more thanenough for any application, combined with a maximum RAM of 512K and, later,up to 128K ROM.andM;The Compass was small enough to fit in a briefcase and built like a miniaturetank.andP;  A salesman said he used to drop the machine on the floor at least onceduring his pitch to show its strength.andM;The Compass used a power-hungry, 25-line, electroluminescent display, laterexchange for gas plasma.andM;Grid OS, the Compass operating system built around the Intel Corp. 8086 chip,was non-MS-DOS although the Microsoft system was rapidly becoming a standard.andM;As one Grid employee said, &quot;DOS really took over the marketplace, but ouroperating system was simply easier to use.andP;  We only went to DOS when we hadto.&quot;andM;Grid OS was menu- and command-code driven with an Lotus-like interface.andM;Users paged through lists of selections, pressing confirm keys to makechoices.andP;  Selecting a file automatically started its application.andM;Applications were straightforward and simple to operate.andP;  GridWrite, the wordprocessor, allowed find, substitute, jump-by-paragraph and rudimentary wordwrap, but little else.andM;Zenith Z-248andM;The Zenith Z-248, an 8-MHz 286 desktop micro with its motherboard on a cardhas been by far the most common computer in the government.andM;The Air Force awarded Zenith Data Systems the 3-year Z-248 contract, nowcalled Desktop II, in February 1986, with the expectation the governmentmight buy up to 90,000 micros through the deal.andM;At the time, no one predicted how popular the Z-248 would become.andM;To say that the Z-248 contract was wildly successful is no overstatement.andP;  Infact, less than two years into the contract, the government had bought225,000 for the computers for $661 million, Air Force estimates at the timeshowed.andM;The Air Force decided to halt procurements temporarily until it could tallyup the numbers and determine if it had exceeded the contracths procurementauthority.andP;  After consulting with the General Services Administration, theAir Force lifted the moratorium and estimated that another 150,000 micros,worth about $443 million, might be bought in the contract's final year.andM;By the end of the contract, which expired in February, the government hadbought 399,000 Z-248s, 80 percent of all Zeniths sold to the federalgovernment and about one-third of all federal micros.andM;The machine came in two flavors.andP;  The more common computer had 1M RAM, a 20Mhard drive and one 360K floppy drive.andP;  A cheaper model had two 360K floppydrives and 512K RAM.andM;Zenith designed the Z-248 with expansion in mind.andP;  The machine features abackplane bus -- most components including the system processor, diskcontroller and system memory reside on separate expansion boards.andM;Norton Utilities 4.0 Sysinfo rates a Z-248 8.6 compared with an IBM Corp. PCXT's 1.0.andM;A spreadsheet test that includes calculation and copying and moving columnsrunning under Lotus Corp. 1-2-3 2.01 Government Edition took about 38 secondson a Z-248 compared with about 8 seconds for a Compaq Computer Corp. Deskpro386/25.andP;  Retrieving and storing a 200K WordPerfect document took 6.5 secondsand 11 seconds on the Z-248 compared with 3.5 and 5.5 seconds on the Compaq386/25.andP;  Norton Sysinfo rated the Compaq at 29.9.andM;On a recent GCN Product Preference Survey (see Page 26), the Zenith finishedsixth of 11 286 machines in satisfaction of their regular users amonggovernment buyers.andM;The Z-248 model wins the prize as the computer most identifiably government.andM;Zenith Z-184andM;The Zenith Data Systems Z-184 laptop was a government-only model for aboutthe first year of its life.andM;It was smaller, lighter and boasted a stronger battery than its commercialcousin the Z-181.andM;After a substantial number of 184s went to the Defense Department, theSupersPort, a Z-184 look-alike, hit the commercial shelves.andM;Zenith introduced the Z-184 Standard Lap-Held, a Joint Services requirementscontract awarded in August 1987.andM;&quot;We took a look at the [request for proposals] and decided we could cut costsand be more competitive if we took a few things off,&quot; said Thomas Buchsbaum,vice president of Zenith Data Systems' Federal Systems.andM;Among other small changes, Zenith removed two ports, the external keypadconnector and the expansion bus capabilities from the SupersPort and namedthe resulting machine the Z-184.andM;That award of Standard Lap-Held to Zenith moved about 90,000 Zenith laptops,including the Z-184, into DOD offices.andP;  Zenith also has placed Z-184s incivilian federal organizations, such as the General Services Administration,the House of Representatives and the Agriculture Department.andM;By today's standards the Z-184 is not exactly a notebook computer; withbattery pack it comes to about 13 pounds.andM;The computer uses a speed-selectable Intel Corp. 8-MHz 80C88 processor,running MS-DOS.andM;In GCN tests the Z-184 returned a 1.6 on the Norton Utilities 4.0 Sysinfotest, compared with 1.0 for an IBM Corp. PC XT and 8.6 for a Zenith Z-248 286desktop.andP;  The 20M hard drive tested out at 99-millisecond average random-readaccess time.andM;Unlike the Grid Compass, replaced by MS-DOS models, Zenith still makes theZ-184.andP;  However, Zenith officials are studying a proposal to eliminate thecomputer.andM;Sales of its SupersPort have increased to the point that Zenith may simplyuse it, with its added ports and memory capabilities, to fulfill futuregovernment contract needs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
