 Networks of PCs can share a singleprinter, displace, replace, or complement minicomputers, and link you tomainframes or huge databases.andM;With all these benefits and more, it's no wonder that an extensive survey ofPC Magazine readers shows that nearly 50 percent of all PCs have somecommunications capability and over 20 percent are on networks.andP;  Over 63percent of the surveyed readers report that their organizations have LANsinstalled.andM;The pieces and parts of PC-based LAN can cost between $250 and $800 per node,not counting the price of each PC; in addition, the network cabling can rangefrom a few dollars to a thousand dollars per node.andP;  Yet companies havecommitted themselves to networks because they know that LANs improve personaland workgroup productivity and provide shared access to expensive resources.andO;This helps to recapture their installation costs quickly.andM;Two articles in this issue of PC Magazine focus on the products at the coreof this market: LAN operating systems.andP;  As a class, these systems havemetamorphosed from ugly caterpillars into lovely butterflies in the pastyear.andP;  Products that previously needed the experienced hand of a specialistare now easily mastered by anyone with a working knowledge of DOS.andM;In addition to operating systems themselves, we take an in-depth look athigh-powered network servers.andP;  Executive editor John Dickinson spent weeks atPC LAN Labs in Florida, up and down Silicon Valley, and across the Texasplains capturing and taming these &quot;super servers.&quot;andP;  He reports on thetechnological breakthroughs in new 386- and 486-based machines with multipleprocessors and other performance enhancements.andM;We also measure the ability of PC-based networks to beat minicomputers attheir own game.andP;  Seniro editor Lee The.andP;  experts from the accounting firm ofPrice Waterhouse, and several companies specializing in accounting softwareall subjected many different kinds of PC-based LANs and a minicomputer to anextensive set of real-world multiuser accounting benchmark tests.andM;Articles on 32-bit network adapters and handy ways to enhance networkprinting round out our coverage.andM;NETWORKS = SHARINGandM;You install and manage networks so that people working at PCs can shareprinters, mainframe connections, data and program files, CD-ROM infobases,modems, fax boards, and other devices.andP;  In a network, a computer acting as aserver hosts a resource and makes it available to other linked PCs.andP;  Networkscan include three general types of servers: file, print, and communications.andM;Sometimes file, print, and communications services reside in one computer,and sometimes the tasks are spread among many PCs.andP;  In networks designed bycompanies such as ATandamp;T, Banyan, and DEC, one PC makes lots of servicesavailable to others.andP;  One Banyan server can provide shared file access,communication links to a mainframe, and long-distance links between serversusing X.25 technology.andM;Companies like Microsoft and Novell design their network operating systems sothat many PCs can act as servers of various types, even while people use themto run standard applications.andP;  In a Novell network, the file and printerservices typically reside on one computer while others act as communicationsservers.andM;Database servers, a subset of the file server category, include those serversthat make expensive hardware such as CD-ROM or optical drives available, aswell as &quot;back-end&quot; database processors.andP;  The latter machines process specialcommands, often in IBM's Structured Query Language (SQL), from databasesrunning on networked PCs.andP;  They receive simple requests for reports from theclient stations and execute the complex code needed to extract and compilethem from the raw database.andP;  This reduces the communications load on thenetwork and puts the heavy I/O processing activity close to the technicalstorage devices doing the retrieval.andM;The term communications server includes a variety of types: PCs that let allnetworked stations share a rack of expensive high-speed modems, those thatact as a shared gateway to mainframe communications, and those that routeappropriate network packets over public data networks to distant locations.andO;Fax servers, providing everyone with the ability to share the hardware forincoming and outgoing facsimile transmissions, make up another category.andM;All these servers make possible the applications that provide the functionaland economic rationale for installing a network; the ability to shareinformation and the efficiencies provided by electronic-mail orworkgroup-scheduling programs all justify a LAN.andP;  Of course, servers needspecial software--the LAN operating system--to handle the many tasks involvedin sharing resources.andM;SOFTWARE HOLDS THE KEYandM;A LAN operating system really is a system of separate, interacting parts.andO;These include the software modules working in every networked clientworkstation and the modules found in each server.andM;Operating-system modules in the client stations include the redirector andthe software elements that carry the redirector's output through the network.andO;The redirector modifies DOS in the client stations so that certain requestsfrom applications go out the network adapter for action instead of going tolocal disk drives or I/O ports.andP;  You program the redirector through a menu ora command-line prompt to route all requests addressed to a specific driveletter or I/O port to a selected network resource.andM;The other network software in the client moves the application's request forservice from the redirector onto the network cable.andP;  This software has threeparts: an application program interface (API), a network communicationssection that follows a specific protocol, and drivers customized for the LANadapter.andM;The standard API provides the redirector (and certain classes of applicationsthat make direct calls to the API) with a way to send and receive requests toand from the network.andP;  Some operating systems provide only one API for thetransport-layer software, typically the NetBIOS API using software interrupt5C hex.andP;  Novell has a unique API for its IPX (Internetwork Protocol Exchange)transport-layer software, but an optional module accepts calls fromapplication programs using the NetBIOS 5C hex interrupts and translates themto IPX.andP;  Microsoft LAN Manager networks can use another API called NamedPipes for special node-to-node applications, and particularly for access tocommunications servers.andM;The communications portion of the transport-layer software follows standardprotocols--perhaps NetBIOS, TCP, or Novell's IPX--to move information fromone network node to the other.andP;  Some products, like LAN Manager, can loadinstructions for different protocols on demand, so that the transport-layersoftware can communicate using one of two or three protocols depending on thesource or destination of the particular packet of information.andM;Because the driver software is unique to each hardware card, adaptermanufacturers usually provide the transport-layer software or include codethat you compile into a complete module.andP;  Western Digital, for example,includes with its Ethernet adapter a floppy disk that contains driversoftware compatible with dozens of communications-protocol-and-APIcombinations.andM;The client stations' redirector and transport-layer software could take asmuch as 50K to 70K RAM, as it does in Novell NetWare stations.andP;  Otheroperating systems, like those from Artisoft and D-Link Systems, load part ofthe code in memory outside of the 640K used by DOS, taking only 4K to 10Kaway from it.andP;  Optional operating-system pieces that might also reside in theclient PCinclude a menu to program the services, electronic mail, andstation-to-station chatting.andM;OUR CONTRIBUTORSandM;Ray August, CPA, is a consulting manager at the accounting firm of PriceWaterhouse.andM;Mike Byrd, a fighter pilot for the U.S.andP;

 The server software typically includes some kindof security protection based on either a password attached to each resourceor a table of rights assigned to each named user.andM;HOW SOFTWARE IS SHAREDandM;The sharing software in file, print, and communications servers comes in manydifferent modules.andP;  Communications servers run software that translatesbetween the network and whatever communications speeds, data alphabets, andprotocols the external connections use.andP;  File-server software includessophisticated queues for requests and usually some kind of disk cache.andP;  Diskcaching loads large segments of the data from the hard disk into RAM tosatisfy requests from fast memory instead of from the slower hard disk.andM;File servers might use DOS to access their files, but only of the sake ofsimplicity and economy.andP;  DOS is not a multitasking operating system, and itdoesn't provide the fastest access to files.andP;  High-performance LANfile-server operating systems, like those from ATandamp;T, Banyan, DEC, DSCCommunications, Microsoft, and Novell, handle multiple tasks at once and havevery efficient hard-disk file formats that are capable of handling gigabytesof storage.andM;The choice of DOS or a multitasking operating system as the underprinting ofthe file server marks a significant difference between two kinds of LANoperating-system products.andP;  PCs running file-server operating system based onDOS keep their ability to run standard applications at the same time.andP;  Sinceit is possible to share files or printers with the network and still runlocal applications, all PCs on the network can act as combinationserver/workstation &quot;peers.&quot;andP;  We call these peer-to-peer networks.andO;Multitasking file servers typically are not also used as workstations,although some--particularly LAN Manager servers--can technically run bothfile-server software and normal applications.andM;File-server software in peer-to-peer networks resides in the individual PC'smemory and divides or &quot;slices&quot; the time of the processor between fileservices and the standard applications.andP;  The RAM left for applications istypically about 400K, and the programs run more slowly than normal, but manypeople happily share drives and printers on multiple networked PCs usingpeer-to-peer systems (see &quot;Making Do with DOS&quot; in this issue).andM;Network operating systems have many component modules, but today's softwareisn't difficult to install, and the default installation parameters usuallyprovide excellent operation.andP;  LANs based on multitasking operatin systemsoften have more features and options, so configuring the software is moredifficult.andP;  Yet with careful attention to the manuals, anyone comfortablewith DOS can install and manage these systems.andM;THE SECURITY QUESTIONandM;Security is an important consideration for most organizations: no one wantsan unauthorized employee reading payroll records.andP;  You often need to limitthe activity of network users to certain files to prevent both mischief andinadvertent damage.andP;  Physical security of the server is another importantconsideration: if someone can access all its files from the keyboard, thepotential for catastrophe is high.andP;  Transmission security deserves equalconsideration, as even relatively inexpensive networking analyzers cancapture and decode passwords as they fly across the network.andM;A LAN software package typically uses one of two types of file security plans(LAN Manager makes both techniques available).andP;  The first plan gives eachshared resource on the network a &quot;network name&quot;; a single name can designatea whole shared drive, a subdirectory, or even a file.andP;  You can associate apassword with a network name and limit the real/write/create capabilitiesaffiliated with that password.andP;  This scheme, used by DOS-based networks,makes it easy to shift the shared resources, but one user might have to keeptrack of several passwords.andP;  Security is easily compromised when passwordmanagement is a constant headache.andM;The other security architecture uses the concept of groups: each personbelongs to one or more groups and each group has specific access rights.andO;This architecture, used by NetWare and VINES, makes each person responsibleonly for his or her password and lets the LAN administrator easily movepeople into different groups as they change jobs or leave the organization.andM;DOS-based networks have uniformly poor physical security for the server.andO;Anyone who can get at the server's keyboard can access files on its harddisk.andP;  This problem is shared by early releases of LAN Manager but dealt within Version 2.0.andP;  Servers using multitasking operating systems--AdvancedNetWare 286, NetWare 386, Nexos, and VINES--don't allow access to files fromthe server.andP;  You must go through the network's security system to get them.andM;Encrypting passwords, both when stored on-disk and during transmission, is animportant feature in high-security applications.andP;  Where previously atechnician could easily attach a LAN analyzer to the cable and capturepasswords and data files as they cross the network, NetWare 386 now includesencrypted passwords to thwart such a scheme.andM;DEMYSTIFYING LAN HARDWAREandM;The mystery has gone out of LAN hardware.andP;  Thanks to the efforts of the IEEEand the availability of economical chip sets, a number of standards existthat improve the ability of adapters from different companies to interact onthe same network.andM;Last year (&quot;Low-Cost LANs,&quot; March 28, 1989), we evaluated LANs whose networkadapters used wiring and signaling that did not meet IEEE or other industrystandards, but we now believe the time for accepting proprietary signalingand cabling schemes is over.andM;There are enough varieties of the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard to meet anyorganization's need for noise-resistant fiber-optic cable, reliable coaxialcable, or inexpensive twisted-pair wiring.andP;  The IEEE 802.5 Token-Ringstandard suports IBM's sophisticated LAN-to-mainframe architectures.andP;  An oldaccepted industry standard, ARCnet, is not anointed by the IEEE, but it workswell and is economical.andM;The only justification for accepting a nonstandard LAN wiring scheme is cost.andO;Some nonstandard LAN adapters cost less than $200 per station, but modernArcnet and Ethernet adapters now approach that low price, and the small extrainvestment buys you a reusable and expandable network that doesn't depend onthe future survival of one company.andM;Remember that the support you will receive is a vital consideration.andP;  Eventhough LANs have evolved and average PC users can install and manage them,things can go wrong.andP;  The adapters stretch to the limit the capabilities ofmany PCs to handle I/O jobs.andP;  You will sometimes find it difficult to installand configure applications because of incorrect paths, complicated userrights, buffers, and other problems.andP;  When you need help, it is worth a lotto know that a friendly voice is only a phone call away.andM;UNSTOPPABLE BANDWAGONandM;Dataquest, a Silicon Valley market research firm, has predicted that 60percent of all PCs will be networked in some fashion by the end of 1992.andP;  Theevaluations, benchmark tests, and features tables that follow will help youmake intelligent choices as you take part in this headlong rush towardworkgroup computing.andP;  In the past, the question was whether or not tonetwork.andP;  Today, the question is when to network.andP;  The answer is now.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
