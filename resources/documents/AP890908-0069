Pozsgay is a member of the four-man leadership named in June torun the Communist Party and the country until the October congress.   He is at the center of a fierce debate over whether Hungary'sCommunist Party is to become the first in the Soviet bloc toformally split into factions. Reformists, centrists and hard-linerswill be vying for control of the party's 700,000 members and assetsat the four-day congress opening Oct. 6.   Pozsgay's failure to win election as a congress delegate from thenortheastern town of Debrecen earlier this week prompted a stream ofprotest calls to party president Rezso Nyers.   Secretary-general Karoly Grosz, also in the four-man leadership,faced a stormy meeting of Budapest congress delegates objecting toPozsgay's exclusion.   The official daily Magyar Nemzet reported that Pozsgay wonelection Thursday as a congress delegate in Kecskemet, 40 milesoutside Budapest.   Central Committee official Andras Toth said today thatthree-quarters of the 1,200 delegates already have been chosen.   The congress is supposed to chart the party's course formultiparty elections to be held by June. Nyers has estimated theparty can win at most 30 percent of votes in the East bloc's firstwholly free elections.   Last weekend, a meeting of party reformers, including Pozsgay,Nyers and Premier Miklos Nemeth, indicated some liberals will seek aformal break with the party if the congress does not shift to beinga democratic body.   At the time, hard-liners critical of Pozsgay held a separatemeeting, and received a telegram of greetings from Karoly Grosz, theonly member of the four-man party leadership who was not at thereformists' gathering.</TEXT></DOC>
