The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said it was lending themoney for six months to subsidiaries of First RepublicBank Corp. asan interim step toward restoring the Dallas-based company's health.   Ultimately the aid could rival the largest-ever governmentrescue of a bank, the $4.5 billion bailout in 1984 of ContinentalIllinois National Bank andamp; Trust Co. of Chicago.   And in a move intended to stem any ripple effect on the bankingsystem as a whole, FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman pledged hisagency to fully protect all depositors of the banks as well asgeneral creditors.   That goes beyond the minimum the agency would normally beexpected to insure, which is deposits of $100,000 and less.   The promise covers money borrowed overnight from other banks byFirst RepublicBank to meet the cash rules of the Federal ReserveBoard. However, it does not apply to the holding company and itsbond and note holders.   Seidman said the FDIC was working on a long-term solution to theholding company's problems and was talking to private investorsabout participating in a restructuring.   But he declined to offer specifics and said he could notestimate the size of any eventual rescue package. Private analysts,however, say a rescue of First RepublicBank could ultimately costthe government as much as $2 billion to $4 billion.   The FDIC expects to recoup much of its initial outlay in theContinental bailout, ultimately spending about $1.7 billion.   Seidman, however, stressed the differences between Continentaland First RepublicBank. The Chicago bank's problems were attributedto management misjudgment and wrongdoing.   ``It's very clear the primary reason for (the First Republic)problem is the economy of Texas,'' Seidman told a news conference.   He said the FDIC will assume some control of the subsidiarybank's operations, although not day to day. The current bank'smanagement will remain in place for now, but changes could bediscussed later, he said. The Office of the Comptroller of theCurrency hopes to finish an examination of the company's bookswithin the next several weeks.   First RepublicBank, the largest bank company in Texas and the13th largest in the nation, acknowledged Tuesday it had been forcedto seek federal aid because of a deteriorating loan portfolio,particularly loans tied to commercial real estate, and difficultyin stemming a runoff of deposits.   The holding company, with $33.2 billion in assets and 73subsidiary banks, reported a loss of $656 million last year.   The company has no connection with the San Francisco-based FirstRepublic Bancorp Inc.   Meanwhile, Rep. Fernand G. St Germain, D-R.I., chairman of theHouse Banking Committee, said he planned to hold hearings on theFirst RepublicBank package and on $970 million offered lastSeptember to First City Bancorp. of Houston. That transaction isstill pending because First City bondholders have been balking atplans to pay them 35 cents to 45 cents on the dollar.   St Germain said in a statement that the committee would seek``to determine whether better regulation and greater vigilancecould have kept any of these institutions off the assistancerolls.''   Twenty-nine of RepublicBank's 73 subsidiaries, representingabout 80 percent of the holding company's assets, are pledgingtheir stock as collateral for the FDIC loan, and the parent companyis guaranteeing it.   Federal Reserve Board member Manuel Johnson, who joined Seidmanat the news conference, said First Republic has been borrowing atthe Federal Reserve's discount window for the past several days. Herefused to say how much the bank had borrowed, but did say the bankhad pledged its loans and other assets to back up the borrowings.   The FDIC reported a post-Depression record of 184 bank failureslast year, 50 in Texas, which has been hard hit by the depressedenergy market and the consequent bust in real estate prices.   So far this year, 38 commercial banks have failed nationally, 15of them in Texas.   Seidman said the First RepublicBank aid would not have asignificant impact on the FDIC's insurance fund, which finished1987 with $18.3 billion, up slightly from the end of 1986 despitethe failures.   Analysts, however, say that cutting FDIC losses by attractingprivate investors to First RepublicaBank will be difficult.   ``I think it's going to be tough. This is a monster of aturnaround,'' said Paul Getman, senior financial analyst of TheWefa Group, a Philadelphia-area consulting firm.</TEXT></DOC>
