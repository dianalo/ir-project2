Access will be provided at two points on WestParr, in addition to the one access point on Dardanelli Lane.  </MEMO><TEXT>     64-unit project;  The Los Gatos Town Council late Monday night approved azone change for the 3 1/2 acres on West Parr Avenue at the border of the twocities. The change allows a 64-unit project, which will be the town's firstlow-income housing for families. Officials expect construction to begin inFebruary, with occupancy by tenants in early 1993.;    The Campbell residentssay Los Gatos is &quot;dumping&quot; the low- income project in their neighborhood,which already has two large complexes for the elderly as well as Los GatosCommunity Hospital and Los Gatos Municipal Court. And within the next twoyears, Highway 85 will be built less than a mile away.;    Traffic, parkingcomplaints;  All this, they say, adds to the traffic and parking problems thathave long plagued the area.;    The apartment complex originally was proposedto be 68 units, but the town council pared it to 64 to appease neighbors.;   It will be developed by the non-profit Mid-Peninsula Housing Coalition.;   The council, which had looked into several access points to the projectbecause of traffic concerns, ended up designating one on West Parr Avenue andanother on Dardanelli Lane.;    Los Gatos and Campbell officials say surveysshow the proposed project would generate very little traffic. But Campbellofficials last week decided to take further vehicle counts.;    They reportedback that their data could not be used because they observed area residentsdriving back and forth over the vehicle counter, pumping up the count.;   Town council members said they felt the traffic issue was important enough tourge the Housing Coalition to contribute up to $20,000 for traffic safeguardsin the vicinity. Housing Coalition officials said they would be glad to pay.;   The project would serve families who earn less than 60 percent of thecounty's median income of $57,700 -- or about $15,000 to $38,000 a yeardepending on family size.;    The Housing Coalition chose the site at LosGatos' northern border because land is cheaper there, away from the costliercenter of town. But the residents say it doesn't fit in the area, surroundedlargely by single-family homes. They also say the project threatens to destroyproperty values, and that low- income housing should be spread around LosGatos.; Low-income project; The traffic issues; (box) Campbell residents sayarea has too many high-density developments, generating too much traffic onParr Avenue.; (box) Parents say their children must cross already busy Parr toattend Capri Elementary School.; (box) Los Gatos plans access to the projectfrom Parr Avenue and Dardanelli Lane.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CONNIE SKIPITARES, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910626  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  MAP  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  585  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, June 26, 199100178092,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
