The current violence in the Occupied Territories is aclear sign that the status quo is not sustainable. An earlynegotiated settlement to the underlying Arab-Israeli dispute isessential.   We declare our support for the convening of a properlystructured international conference as the appropriate frameworkfor the necessary negotiations between the parties directlyconcerned. In this perspective, we salute current efforts aimed atachieving a settlement, particularly the initiative pursued by Mr.Shultz since February. We urge the parties to cooperate fully inthe search for a solution.   We have pursued our consultations about the continuing warbetween Iran and Iraq, which remains a source of profound concernto us. We reaffirm our support for Security Council Resolution 598,which was adopted unanimously. We express our warm appreciation forthe efforts of the Secretary General to work for a settlement onthis basis, and reiterate our firm determination to ensureimplementation of this mandatory resolution by a follow-upresolution.   We condemn the use of chemical weapons by either party, deploreproliferation of ballistic missiles in the region, and renew ourcommitment to uphold the principle of freedom of navigation in theGulf.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>SOUTH AFRICA:</HEAD><TEXT>   We declare our abhorrence of apartheid, which must be replacedthrough a process of genuine national negotiations by a non-racialdemocracy.   We expressed our urgent opinion on three particular matters:   1 _ All legal options available in South Africa should be usedto secure clemency for the Sharpeville Six.   2 _ The enactment of legislation designed to depriveanti-apartheid organizations of overseas aid would place severestrain on the relations each of us has with South Africa.   3 _ We strongly support the current negotiations seekingnational reconciliation within Angola, an end to the Angola-Namibiaconflict, and early implementation of UN Security CouncilResolution 435.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>CAMBODIA:</HEAD><TEXT>   As the recent message from Prince Sihanouk has reminded us, thecontinuing Cambodian conflict and the suffering of the Cambodianpeople is of deep concern. We join the vast majority of the nationsof the world in calling for the prompt withdrawal of all Vietnamesetroops.
