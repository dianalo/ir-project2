Corporations plan to award merit salary raises averaging 5.5% to all executives in 1988, down from this year's 6% average, according to a survey by consultant Sibson andamp; Co. But top performers could still end up way ahead, as companies increasingly dangle incentive compensation, bonuses and other &quot;gain-sharing&quot; payments to motivate executives to make that extra push.    &quot;Companies appear, on average, to be granting lower salary increases and higher bonuses,&quot; says Jill Kanin-Lovers of Towers Perrin. It's a trend applauded by Lance Berger of Hay Group. &quot;With greater portions of pay 'at risk,' managers are encouraged to perform better,&quot; he says. By Hay's count, such bonus payments now account for nearly half the total compensation paid top executives. Back in 1983, bonuses represented barely a third of total pay.    But base salaries could resume their upswing in 1989, suggests Mercer-Meidinger-Hansen, another consultant.    FLEXIBLE BENEFITS are offered by more firms, spurred by Tax Reform Act.    Consultant Wyatt Co. says 22% of the corporations it surveyed now have cafeteria benefit plans, which permit employees to pick from a broad menu of fringe benefits. Of the rest, says Wyatt, a third are thinking of adopting flexible plans by 1988. Last year's tax act removed doubts about the legality of the programs, explains Wyatt's Lance Tane. The act, moreover, imposes nondiscrimination rules that require employers to reconsider what they offer now.    Hershey Foods Corp. will join the trend in January; the old rigid plans, it says, are no longer suitable for today's employee population. Scott Paper Co. also will open the year with a full flexible program for salaried employees. But Dana Corp. goes slow because of what an official calls &quot;the front-end expense in offering the choices.&quot; And Taco Viva Inc., a chain of 63 fast-food outlets, thinks it's &quot;too small.&quot;    WE AREN'T ARROGANT, young executives insist, it just looks that way.    In survey after survey, senior managers often have accused junior colleagues of being haughty, disloyal, unethical, even boorish. But it isn't so, asserts Bruce Judson, a 29-year-old project leader at Boston Consulting Group. &quot;Some people are energetic and enthusiastic,&quot; he says. &quot;That becomes mistaken for brashness and arrogance, especially by people who are comfortable with the existing system.&quot;    Charles Oppenheimer, a 29-year-old manager at Apple Computer Inc., denies young executives are &quot;opportunistic&quot; when they switch jobs to get ahead. The complaint, he suggests, comes from managers taught to &quot;wait your turn.&quot; As for ethics, &quot;I don't see a big difference&quot; among age groups, responds Beth Smithers, also 29, an accounting supervisor at Hewlett-Packard Co.    The next crop of executives will be more idealistic, predicts a 30-year-old at American General Corp.    CAN A PARTNER file an age discrimination complaint if he's forced out? He can if he wasn't &quot;a central corporate decision maker or owner.&quot; So rules federal judge John Walker in New York on a pretrial motion in Conrad Caruso's action against accountants Peat, Marwick, Mitchell andamp; Co.    WOMEN MUST SUCCEED faster than men, says Bernadette Kenny, a consultant with Lee Hecht Harrison. Because of self-imposed deadlines tied, in part, to family planning, &quot;age 35 to 40 is now the critical threshold when females must be considered for senior-level positions, or lose the opportunity for good,&quot; she says. Men, by contrast, have until 45 to 50.    DON'T ACCEPT a temporary office from your ex-employer after you've been fired, advises outplacement consultant James Challenger. &quot;The away-from-home office is probably the worst deterrent to a job search that exists,&quot; he contends; it only &quot;fosters the illusion&quot; that you're still employed.    BELIEVE IT! Fully 80% of the gossip you hear around the water cooler is accurate, says recruiter Robert Half of Robert Half Inc. Managers should consider the company grapevine &quot;as much a communication vehicle as the company house organ or employee meetings,&quot; he writes in Management Accounting magazine.    DIRECTORS DON'T KNOW how liable they are, a consultant contends.    Despite concern that they can be sued for their corporate decisions, many directors still aren't aware of how exposed they can be, says Risk Management Corp. The consultant says directors generally think they are adequately covered, but most display &quot;an extremely low awareness&quot; of the specific insurance their companies provide.    Many directors, for instance, don't realize they could be liable for past actions if their companies later drop coverage or even change insurance carriers. Protection often stops one to six months after the policy runs out, even for acts that occurred while the insurance was in force, says Peter Daenzer, Risk Management's chairman.    Directors are especially vulnerable after hostile takeovers, when coverage is likely to change, he says.    THE CHECKOFF: Only 17% of the executives questioned by consultant Goodrich andamp; Sherwood Co. take time out for their full vacations. . . . What do secretaries do for their bosses? Responded one to a survey by Mita Copystar America Inc., the copier company: &quot;Everything except breathe for him and go to the men's room (except I do have to point him in the right direction).&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
