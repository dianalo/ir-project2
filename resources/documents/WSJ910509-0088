But directors continue to support Shawmut's chairman, JoelB. Alvord, and its president, Gunnar S. Overstrom Jr., eventhough the bank -- New England's third-largest, with assetsof $22.9 billion -- has posted steep losses for the pastcouple of quarters.</LP><TEXT>   Although regulators haven't formally sought a managementchange, two directors who didn't want to be identified saidthat regulators recently have intensified their questioningabout the ability of current management to solve the bank'sproblems. Such regulatory pressure is uncommon at largebanks.   &quot;The regulators would love to have them out,&quot; said a boardmember about Mr. Alvord and Mr. Overstrom. &quot;It's not theirdecision, though. It's the board's call, and we remain behindthem.&quot; It isn't clear what regulators, who wouldn't comment,will do if the board continues to support top management.   &quot;It's inappropriate for us to comment on the regulators ortheir actions,&quot; said a spokesman for the bank. &quot;However, withrespect to our performance, the board, management, employeesand regulators are all seeking improved performance, which weall believe is forthcoming.&quot;   Along with general concerns about the bank's condition,regulators are unhappy about the slowness of the bank torecognize its problems. The bank posted $82.7 million inearnings for the first nine months of 1990 -- with threeprofitable quarters -- only to have those gains overwhelmedby the large fourth-quarter loss, resulting in a $133 millionloss for the year.   The first-quarter loss was $116.7 million, even with aone-time gain of $71.5 million from the sale of itscredit-card division, following a $215.7 million loss in the1990 fourth quarter. The bank announced in January it wouldcut its work force 10%, or about 1,200 employees.   Regulators who didn't want to be named emphasized that thebank still can recover from its difficulties. While Shawmuthas the highest concentration of regional real-estate loansof New England's large banks -- the major cause of itsproblem loans -- it still has shareholders' equity of $1.1billion, or 4.7% of total assets, which is consideredadequate by regulators.   The bank, based in Hartford, Conn., has been operating forthe past year under a supervisory agreement with the Officeof the Comptroller of the Currency, which obligates the bankto strengthen lending practices, credit review, liquidityplanning and management information systems. Regulators alsoare carefully watching the bank's level of nonperformingassets, which rose $55 million in the first quarter to $1.74billion, or 7.6% of total assets, in addition to charge-offsof $140 million.   The comptroller's office is &quot;clearly not pleased with thepace of change,&quot; said one federal regulator. &quot;Things are notgetting better.&quot; Several other banks in New England also areoperating under a supervisory agreement.   Mr. Alvord, 52 years old, had been chairman of HartfordNational Corp. and helped engineer a merger of that bank withShawmut Corp. in 1988. He became chairman of the combinedbanks a few months after the merger. Mr. Overstrom, 48, waschief financial officer and executive vice president atHartford National, and became president of the combined banksin 1988.   At a contentious annual meeting on April 23, shareholderscited the large fourth-quarter loss, after three profitablequarters, as an indication that the bank hasn't reckoned withits loan problems. Shareholders also criticized compensationof executives, even though Mr. Alvord's pay was cut to$650,000 last year from $1 million in 1989.   At some point after the shareholder meeting, the board metwith nearly a dozen regulators from the comptroller's office,the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal ReserveBank of Boston. The comptroller's office, which is in themiddle of a review &quot;focused on the bank's risk-ratingsystems&quot; that assess the quality of loans, gave an interimreport on its findings to the board, according to oneregulator. &quot;They expressed their concern about the bank'scondition. There's a perception that senior management hasnot recognized the severity of the problem.&quot;   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Shawmut closed at $6.50 a share, unchanged.</TEXT></DOC>
