In an electronically disguised voice, Mermelstein said he hadsmuggled up to 55 tons of cocaine into the United States as anemployee of ``the boys from Colombia'' before his arrest in 1985.   His testimony came at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committeethat its chairman, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said was designed toprovide background for the comprehensive drug-fighting blueprint duefrom the Bush administration next month.   Mermelstein told the committee the United States has beenhampered in its effort to fight drug cartels in part ``because wedeal directly with the police and local governments and in SouthAmerica that's a direct line to the cartel.''   Police and public officials except for high-ranking army officersare brought under control by the cocaine cartel through bribe moneyand the threat of murder, Mermelstein said.   ``They own them,'' Mermelstein said. ``... Either they take themoney or they die.''   He said such corruption is widespread and, ``in the Bahamas, itgoes all the way to the top.''   He testified that he was once ``offered a deal by a Bahamianofficial of so much per kilo for any cocaine confiscated by theBahamian government for distribution in the United States.'' Thecommittee did not ask the official's name.   He portrayed cartel leaders as using billions of dollars fromcocaine sales in the United States to pursue a globe-hoppinglifestyle, including frequent visits to the bullfights in Mexico andSpain. ``Fabio Ochoa considers himself an afficienado and afirst-class bullfighter,'' he said.   He said members of the Ochoa family, top leaders of one cartel,were on hand for the last summer's Olympics in South Korea. He saidanother cartel kingpin, Pablo Escobar, has easily slipped in and outof the United States using fake documents.   A former assistant U.S. attorney in Miami, Richard Gregorie, toldthe committee the Customs Service and the Marshals Service developeda plan to arrest Jorge Ochoa last fall during a trip to Caracas,Venezuela and fly him to the United States for trial, but the planwas dropped because of State Department opposition.   Ochoa has been indicted by U.S. grand juries several times, butthe Colombian Supreme Court abrogated that country's extraditiontreaty with the United States two years ago and cannot be arrestedby his country's authorities on a U.S. warrant.   Mermelstein told the panel how he witnessed a murder in the early1970s and was ``allowed to live'' on condition that he would workfor the cartel and subsequently imported up to 56 tons of cocaineinto the United States. He was arrested in 1985, served two years inprison and is now in the government's witness protection program.   He said cartel leaders have put a seven-figure price on his head.   In other testimony, Robert W. Merkle, a former U.S. attorney inTampa, told the committee that Colombia has ``a government that isin many respects a hostage of the criminal element in its midst.''   ``This is not surprising given the fact that the narco-terroristsare responsible for the assassination of scores of judges,journalists, police officers and innocent civilians in a campaign oftotal intimidation,'' he said. He said the Peruvian government hasbeen hobbled by leftist rebels who obtained an estimated $500million last year through drug trafficking.   He also said Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega ``maintains hispower and his control through alliance with narcotics.''</TEXT></DOC>
