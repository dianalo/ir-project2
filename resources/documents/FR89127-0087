The methodology for derivingthe PSAF has evolved since 1980 partly as a result of several extensivereviews including two public comment processes, two GAO reviews, and areview by a public accounting firm.The current PSAF methodology uses the 25 largest privately owned bank holdingcompanies (``BHCs'') in a model to compute an average interest rate onshort-term debt that is then applied to the value of Federal Reserve short-termpriced service assets requiring financing. The BHC model also is used tocalculate a three-year average long-term debt rate and a three-year averagepretax rate of return on stockholders' equity that are applied to long-termdepreciable priced services assets in proportion to the ratio of debt andequity, also computed from the BHC model. The methodology calls for theBHCs with the highest and lowest return on equity in the sample each yearto be excluded to prevent distortions. Additional costs are then imputed,including estimates of sales taxes that would be paid on planned purchasesand FDIC insurance that would be paid on clearing balances and other depositsheld with the Federal Reserve. Finally, the expenses of the Board of Governorsdirectly related to the development of priced services are estimated. Allof these costs comprise the PSAF.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>Since June 1988, the Board has performed a thorough review of the System'smethod for calculating the PSAF. This review was initiated because theapproved methodology, which uses a three-year average that includes thelow 1987 average earnings for the 25 largest BHCs, would have produceda 1989 PSAF that was dramatically lower than that approved for 1988 (seeTable 1). The Board believes that unusually low, or high, average earningsrates for any one year should not greatly affect estimates of the longerterm, or normal, earnings rates for comprable private sector business firmsfor purposes of establishing prices.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ As a result, in October 1988, the Board approved an interimPSAF using five-year average data to be applied to the prices of electronicand securities services as of January 1, 1989 (53 FR 44661, November 4,1988). The 1988 PSAF was used for check services, which were repriced asof September 1, 1988 (53 FR 24148, June 27, 1988) (see Table 1).In addition to focusing on variability, the review addressed other areasof the PSAF where questions have been raised in recent years. These areasincluded the assets reported on the consolidated pro forma priced servicesbalance sheet, the imputed capital structure, and the imputed FDIC assessment.In addition, the Board concluded that the BHC model is still the most appropriatebasis for calculating components of the PSAF because BHCs offer servicesmost comparable to those offered by the Federal Reserve Banks and viewthemselves as competitors of the Federal Reserve.As a result of the review, the Board is proposing the following revisionsto the methodology for calculating the PSAF:<ITAG tagnum="84">Expanded Sample Size and Extended Sample Period</ITAG>The Board proposes to expand the sample of bank holding companies usedin the PSAF calculation from the 25 to the 50 largest privately-owned bankholding companies in each year \2\<NOTE/> and to average the most recent five years of bank holdingcompany data to determine the pretax return on equity, the long-term debtrate, and the ratio of long-term debt and equity used to compute the PSAF.The Board believes that this change will substantially reduce the volatilityof the PSAF because each BHC will have a smaller impact on the overallaverage, and a longer time period smoothes aberrant results of any oneyear. It is anticipated that use of a larger sample and a longer sampleperiod will decrease the frequency of ad hoc adjustments and eliminatethe routine exclusion of the BHCs with the highest and lowest average returnon equity each year. The larger sample size also allows for the inclusionof a number of regional correspondent banks and increases the geographicaldiversity of the group. Data analysis indicates that the impact of expandingthe sample size and lengthening the time period does not introduce a systematicbias toward either a higher or lower PSAF over time (see Table 2).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The sample size was changed once before, in 1984, followingrequest for public comment (49 FR 11251, March 26, 1984). At that time,the sample was increased from the largest 12 BHCs to the largest 25 BHCs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Capital Adequacy</ITAG>The Board proposes that the Federal Reserve meet the risk-based capitalguideline of 8 percent capital to risk-weighted assets as approved by theBoard for state member banks and bank holding companies, including in assetsa computation of cash items in the process of collection (``CIPC'') ona basis comparable to a commercial bank. Under the Board's proposal, however,net CIPC will continue to be included on the consolidated pro forma pricedservices balance sheet because the purpose of this balance sheet is toshow only assets that need to be financed. Net CIPC represents float (thedifference between total CIPC and deferred-availability cash items), whichneeds to be financed through priced services operations.The Board believes that the current method for imputing equity capital,using the BHC sample data, also continues to be appropriate because sufficientequity capital is derived to finance long-term assets. The Federal Reserveimputes equity for priced services by assuming that long-term assets arefinanced by long-term debt and equity in the proportion of long-term debtand equity of the BHCs in the model. Using the proposed sample size andsample period, this imputation will result in over 70 percent of depreciablepriced services assets being financed by equity. Given, however, the recentBoard approval of a risk-based capital standard for state member banksand bank holding companies, the Board believes that the PSAF methodologyshould ensure that this derived amount of capital is sufficient to meetthe risk-based capital guideline imposed on state member banks and bankholding companies. Using the equity amount imputed in the 1989 PSAF, theFederal Reserve has nearly three times the level of equity needed to meetthe risk-based guideline. This is shown in Table 3 and reflects the calculationof CIPC similar to a commercial bank's CIPC.In the past, some groups have suggested that the Federal Reserve shouldimpute a level of equity on its pro forma priced services balance sheetsufficient to meet the current regulatory capital guideline of 6 percentcapital, including equity, to total assets when CIPC is included, on abasis similar to that reported by BHCs. Under the Board's proposed methodologyfor imputing capital, Federal Reserve priced services equity capital wouldamount to 4.4 percent of total priced services assets (see Table 3). Becauseof the high percentage of depreciable assets that will be financed withequity and because of the strong risk-based capital computation noted above,the Board believes that the current methodology for imputing equity capitalis appropriate and results in a level of equity capital that is sufficientto support priced services operations.<ITAG tagnum="84">FDIC Insurance Assessment </ITAG>The Board proposes to calculate the imputed FDIC insurance assessment onthe basis required by the FDIC of a commercial bank. Currently, the FederalReserve computes an imputed amount of FDIC insurance by applying the FDICassessment rate to the projected level of clearing balances plus net CIPC.The proposed computation revision would apply the required FDIC assessmentrate to projected clearing balances held with the Federal Reserve plusa projection of deferred credits on a basis similar to a commercial bank.Accordingly, the following deferred credits would be excluded: intra-Systemdeferred credits that would otherwise be double-counted on a consolidatedFederal Reserve balance sheet; deferred credits associated with nonpriceditems, such as deferred credits to government agencies; and deferred creditsassociated with providing fixed availability or credit prior to receiptand processing of items.\3\<NOTE/> The H.4.1 weekly statement of condition of the Reserve Banksreflects only the consolidation of Reserve Bank data. Accordingly, creditsor fixed availability posted prior to receipt and processing of items,as well as nonpriced collection items, must be deducted from the H.4.1data to derive deferred credits comparable to those reported by a commercialbank. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ A financial institution provides credit for a cash letterto its customer when the cash letter is received and processed. In contrast,on direct and consolidated shipments, Reserve Banks provide credit to customersbased on an advice from the customer that a cash letter has been forwardedfor collection; accounting for the credit sometimes predates receipt andprocessing of the cash letter. This change in methodology for computing the FDIC insurance and calculationof a consolidated priced CIPC amount, would result in an increase to thePSAF amount to be recovered. In 1989, the FDIC insurance amount would increasefrom $1.9 million to $4.1 million, an increase of $2.2 million (see Table4).<ITAG tagnum="21">By order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,January 23, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William W.
