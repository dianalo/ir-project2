Sells Its Department Stores To Unit's Managers </HL><SO> </SO><CO> TOY </CO><IN> TNM </IN><DATELINE> PARAMUS, N.J.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Inc. said it sold its department-store division in a leveraged buy-out to a group including the division's management. Terms weren't disclosed.    The toy retailer said it expects to record a pretax gain on the sale of $2 million in the third quarter ending Oct. 30. In the year-earlier quarter, the company earned $18.4 million, or 14 cents a share, on sales of $600.2 million.    The department-store division consists of the Boston Store in Albany and Schenectady, N.Y., and the Fair in Flint, Mich. A spokesman said the division is profitable, but doesn't fit in with the company's main operations. The two department stores remain from the days when Toys &quot;R&quot; Us emerged from Interstate Department Stores Inc.'s bankruptcy proceedings 11 years ago. </TEXT></DOC>
