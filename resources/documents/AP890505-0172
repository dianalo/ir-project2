Details of their hour-long discussion were not revealed. Quaylealso spent some time in his office and left at mid-afternoon forhis residence.   Earlier, Quayle said what he had learned on his 12-day trip toAustralia and Southeast Asia will help him influence policy in theBush administration.   Quayle's first stop after traveling 41 hours was the WhiteHouse, where he had lunch with President Bush.   Among the topics sure to be discussed were the oil spill inAlaska's Prince William Sound, which Quayle visited Thursday. Thevice president toured an oil-drenched pebble beach on Smith Island,talking with workers hired to wash stones.   He told reporters at a midnight news conference at Elmendorf AirForce Base near Anchorage that Bush has no plan to visit thedevastated area but is keenly interested in the situation.   The administration's view is that ``those who are responsiblefor it clean it up, and clean it up quickly,'' Quayle said. He wasaccompanied on his tour by Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinnerand Adm. Paul Yost, commandant of the Coast Guard.   Exxon Corp., owner of the Exxon Valdez, the tanker that ranaground on March 24, dumping 11 million gallons of crude into thesound, has been criticized by Alaskan officials, who say thecompany has failed to devote enough resources to the cleanup.   The officials are also upset the Bush administration did notrespond fast enough to help in the crisis. The federal governmentis now coordinating the cleanup effort, which is being paid for byExxon.   But Quayle called Bush ``an environmentalist'' and added, ``Thispresident is not going to let anyone off the hook.''   Asked if Exxon had done enough, Quayle said, ``Exxon is clearlygoing to have to do more.''   Quayle said that his trip to Australia, Indonesia, Thailand andSingapore, his second foreign excursion since he became vicepresident, was worthwhile because it gave him a feel for a numberof issues, including the situation in Cambodia, and allowed him tomake personal contact with leaders in those countries.   He said he learned valuable information that will help him haveinput into policy decisions in the Bush administration. ``Iguarantee you what I learned on the trip ... will help makepolicy,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
