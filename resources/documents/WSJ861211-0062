All eyes were on Hisham Nazer as he arrived here for today's OPEC meeting, his first since replacing Ahmed Zaki Yamani last month as Saudi oil minister. But Mr. Nazer wasn't telling anyone, publicly or privately, how Saudi Arabia wants OPEC to boost prices from the current $15 a barrel.    &quot;We are waiting to see how (the Saudis) propose to push the price up,&quot; said a senior OPEC minister. &quot;They haven't given any indication yet.&quot; In private conversations with other ministers, Mr. Nazer coupled his advocacy of an $18 price with assurances that Saudi Arabia wouldn't act as a swing producer, one that unilaterally lowers its oil production to boost prices.    Ministerial sources said, however, they thought Saudi Arabia might agree to lower production collectively with OPEC's 12 other members, although Mr. Nazer hasn't said so expressly.    Whatever solution OPEC chooses must be reached quickly, oil-industry executives said. &quot;Every day that passes with them fumbling around weakens confidence in any agreement they reach,&quot; said the president of an oil-trading firm based here.    At worst, ministers said, OPEC will simply extend its production-restraint accord, which limits total output to about 17.3 million barrels a day. The agreement is scheduled to end this year. </TEXT></DOC>
