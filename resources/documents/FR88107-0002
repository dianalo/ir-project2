The minimum net weight of limes which must be packedin a currently authorized master container is being reduced from 38 to35 pounds when that container is used for bagged limes and the containeris marked ``Master Container.'' The current minimum of 38 pounds requiresmore limes to be packed in the container than it can comfortably hold,resulting in damaged fruit and deformed containers. The lower minimum netweight is expected to correct this problem. The rule also adds a containerto the list of containers currently authorized for shipment of Floridalimes. Such action will make available to handlers an additional containerwhich they need to ship limes to market. This action was recommended bythe Florida Lime Administrative Committee, which works with the Departmentin administering the Florida lime marketing order.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>This interim final rule becomes effective January 7, 1988.Comments which are received by February 8, 1988 will be considered priorto issuance of the final rule.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Interested persons are invited to submit written commentsconcerning this interim rule.

Cioffi, Chief, MarketingOrder Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P.O.Box 96456, Room 2525-S, Washington, DC 20090-6456; telephone (202) 447-2491.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>This rule is issued under MarketingOrder No. 911, as amended (7 CFR Part 911), regulating the handling oflimes grown in Florida. This order is effective under the AgriculturalMarketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafterreferred to as the Act.This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 and DepartmentalRegulation 1512-1 and has been determined to be a ``non-major'' rule undercriteria contained therein.Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has consideredthe economic impact of this action on small entities.The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesssubject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be undulyor disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to theAct and rules issued thereunder are unique in that they are brought aboutthrough group action of essentially small entities acting on their ownbehalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.There are approximately 26 handlers of Florida limes subject to regulationunder the Florida lime marketing order, and approximately 263 lime producersin Florida. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the SmallBusiness Administration (13 CFR 121.2) as those having annual gross revenuesfor the last three years of less than $100,000, and small agriculturalservice firms are defined as those whose gross annual receipts are lessthan $3,500,000. The majority of the handlers and producers may be classifiedas small entities.This action temporarily relaxes through March 31, 1988, container requirementsfor Florida limes by reducing the net weight contents of a shipping containerused for bagged limes. The rule also permanently adds a container to thelist of containers currently authorized for shipment of Florida limes.Container requirements for Florida limes are prescribed in andSection; 911.329in terms of inside dimensions and net weight capacity which handlers mustmeet when they ship limes grown within the production area outside thatarea. Paragraph (a)(2)(v) of that section prescribes the specificationsof one of the containers handlers may use for such shipments. That containerhas inside dimensions of 12\3/4\ x 15\3/4\ x 10\3/4\ inches and is requiredto contain not less than 38 pounds nor more than 42 pounds net weight oflimes.The committee reported that handlers have been using this container asa master shipping container for bagged limes, but that the container istoo small to comfortably hold the 38 pound minimum net weight. This hasresulted in damaged fruit. Reducing the minimum net weight of the contentsof this container to 35 pounds when it is used for bagged limes is expectedto ensure that limes free from damage due to packing reach the consumer.Requiring such containers to be marked ``Master Container'' when they containbagged limes is designed to differentiate such containers from containerscontaining loose limes for which the minimum weight will continue to be38 pounds. A conforming change is made to andSection; 911.311. This shouldhelp foster better sales and have a positive effect on the industry.The committee indicated that if the reduced net weight proved successful,it would consider making the 35 pound minimum net weight a permanent partof the lime container requirements.The committee also recommended adding a container with inside dimensionsof 11 x 16\3/4\ x 10 inches, containing between 38 and 42 pounds net weightof limes, to the list of currently authorized containers. This containerwas removed from the list of authorized containers effective August 1,1986 (51 FR 27517). A survey of handlers conducted by the committee priorto the removal of the container from the list indicated that the containerwas no longer used. However, recent information indicates that some handlersdesire to use this large capacity container.Therefore, the Department's view is that the impact of the relaxed containerrequirements upon producers and handlers will be beneficial and have apositive effect on industry operations. The application of a less restrictiveminimum weight for the specified container will help ensure that limesfree from packing damage reach the consumer. The addition of a new containerwill benefit handlers by providing them with a container needed to shipfresh Florida limes to market.Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that thisaction will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities.After consideration of the information and recommendations submitted bythe committee, and other available information, it is found that the ruleas hereinafter set forth will tend to effectuate the declared policy ofthe Act.Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that it is impracticable,unnecessary and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary noticeprior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause exists fornot postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publicationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> because: (1) The 1987-88 shipping season is inprogress, and to maximize benefits to the industry this action should applyto as many shipments as possible; (2) this action is based upon the unanimousrecommendation of the committee considered at public meetings; and (3)handlers are prepared to conduct their operations in accordance with thisrule and do not require any additional time for preparation.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 911 </ITAG>Marketing agreements and orders, Limes, Florida.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 911_LIMES GROWN IN FLORIDA</ITAG>1.
