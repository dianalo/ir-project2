Philips Optical-Disk UnitIs Running Up Against Tough Hurdles---By Laurie HaysStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> DD PHGELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE) </IN><TEXT>   Du Pont Co.'s much touted venture with N.V. Philips into the optical-disk industry has been disappointing so far and still faces difficult challenges.    The joint venture, Philips/Du Pont Optical, was formed in early 1986. It aimed to generate sales of $1 billion by 1990 by capturing 25% of a fast-growing world market for compact audio, video and computer-data storage disks. The company publicized its high hopes in slick publications and news releases.    Instead, Philips/Du Pont has run up against stiff competition, excessive capacity, aggressive price cutting and languishing market growth. Wilmington, Del.-based Du Pont won't provide any sales figures, but the venture hasn't shown any profit yet, according to Alfred Bok, chairman and chief executive officer of Philips/Du Pont. He predicts it will break even this year.    For Du Pont, the experience shows the difficulty of shifting from traditional commodity-based fibers and plastics businesses into such higher-margin areas as electronic products, agricultural chemicals and biomedical products. The technologies advance quickly and competition is everywhere.    Edgar S. Woolard, Du Pont's president and chief operating officer, nurtured the establishment of the venture. He says Du Pont is still &quot;very optimistic&quot; about its prospects, but he acknowledges hurdles that must be overcome. &quot;The real challenge,&quot; he says, is whether Philips/Du Pont Optical &quot;can get there and stay ahead.&quot;    Philips/Du Pont also demonstrates the challenges that arise when two large companies like Philips and Du Pont combine operations. Philips/Du Pont is the largest non-energy joint venture Du Pont has ever tried. So far, each parent has invested about $150 million, and each plans to spend an additional $100 million in the near future.    Netherlands-based Philips, one of the largest electronics concerns in the world, has been a leader in optical-disk technology. Du Pont, the world's largest chemicals concern, has contributed the strength of its plastics know-how to the venture.    Officials from both companies say they have encountered &quot;cultural differences.&quot; Some industry analysts speculate that those differences may have slowed the venture, causing it to lose ground to stiff competition from Japanese concerns.    &quot;Du Pont is very conservative and very prestigious,&quot; Mr. Bok says. &quot;Philips is prestigious, too, but has a different way of doing business. Different cultures slow you down, but it makes other things go very fast.&quot; He declined to be more specific.    The venture took its biggest blow in the compact-audio-disk market. Only one year ago, Philips/Du Pont had captured the biggest share of this fast-growing industry. Consumers were snapping up disks so fast that suppliers couldn't keep up with demand. Philips was out in front with a commanding lead over Sony Corp. and other Japanese companies that hadn't yet come up with the technology.    The growth potential, however, looked so attractive that producers, particularly the Japanese, quickly popped up everywhere. Announced capacity grew to 450 million units in 1987 from 120 million in 1986. In one year, the Philips/Du Pont market share dropped to 20% from 35%, according to Mr. Bok.    Meanwhile, the consumer buying spree turned out to be short-lived. According to some analysts, the disks have appealed to serious music buffs and college students, but middle-of-the-road Americans have been slow to convert their record collections. The biggest obstacle is the disks' high cost -- about $15 apiece compared to about $8 for a black vinyl record.    Then, as a result of even greater manufacturing overcapacity, drastic price cutting occurred much more quickly than expected. Disks that were selling to the music company from the manufacturer at $3 to $4 each dropped to $1 each. Philips/Du Pont's profits before tax dropped to between 5% and 10% of sales from 25% of sales, according to Mr. Bok. While analysts hope the price cutting may revive the market, it will also reduce revenue and profit margins.    Philips/Du Pont doesn't expect consumer sales to improve in the near future, though supply and demand should even out eventually. &quot;CD audio profits are very meager,&quot; says Mr. Bok. &quot;Next year will be difficult. It won't be a rich year.&quot;    So Philips/Du Pont now looks to the professional market. It plans to spend a major part of the $200 million capital budget for technology and plants on storage and video disks, Mr. Bok says. But even there, some markets for product lines are growing more slowly than expected.    Despite the troubles that have developed, neither Du Pont nor Philips suggests having any plans to abandon the venture. &quot;If you have two big companies like Philips and Du Pont, it's not something you do overnight,&quot; explains Mr. Bok. &quot;It's a big investment over time.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
