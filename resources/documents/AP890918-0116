The promise and request from top aides to Housing and UrbanDevelopment Secretary Jack Kemp came at a Senate Banking Committeehearing that also included testimony from a former Florida housingofficial who said he despised the way some rental subsidies wereawarded through political connections but didn't complain because itwas the only way to get needed assistance.   And the panel's chairman, Sen. Donald Riegle, said he planned tocall before the committee all of the major figures mentioned inallegations of abuses at HUD, including former Secretary SamuelPierce and his top aides. His decision was seen as an indicationthat the Senate would expand its review of HUD during the Reaganadministration to rival a House investigation of favoritism andabuse at the department during Pierce's tenure.   The hearing focused on HUD's Section 8 Moderate RehabilitationProgram, the subject of a scathing report earlier this year in whichHUD's inspector general said that lucrative subsidies were awardedto former HUD officials or other developers who retained prominentRepublican consultants.   Much of the influence peddling was blamed on a 1984 decision torepeal a ``fair share'' formula through which the subsidies wereawarded to local housing authorities that demonstrated a need forthe low-income housing and the ability to administer the program.   After Congress repealed the formula, HUD headquarters assumedmost of the funding authority and had wide latitude in awardingsubsidies, creating a climate the inspector general said allowedpolitical favoritism to flourish.   Kemp, however, voluntarily decided to revert to using the ``fairshare'' approach and his deputies said the department would continueto do so if the program is funded next year, which is still inquestion.   ``There's no question about that,'' James Logue, HUD's deputyassistant secretary for multifamily housing, said when asked whetherKemp was committed to the fair-share formula.   The inspector general also found that many ``Mod-Rehab'' projectswere approved at excessive rents, costing the government hundreds ofmillions of dollars over the 15-year subsidy contracts.   Logue said about 300 of the projects will be audited in the firstquarter of the new fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, and that HUDwould move to lower the rent subsidies if they were inappropriatelycalculated.   Kemp, at a prior hearing, agreed with a congressman's``ballpark'' estimate that abuses at the agency during Pierce'stenure likely would cost taxpayers about $2 billion.   Logue on Monday said a recent court decision rejecting HUD'sformula for granting rent increases to Section 8 projects could costthe government as much as $2.5 billion over the next decade andasked the committee to take legislative steps to reverse the court'saction.   In the ruling, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected HUD'suse of market comparability studies to determine the annual rentincreases granted for subsidized rental housing.   Logue said the ruling would cost HUD about $150 million in the9th Circuit's jurisdiction, which includes nine Western states, andif applied nationwide could cost the government between $600 millionand $1 billion in retroactive payments and up to an additional $1.5billion over the next decade.   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., who presided over most of the hearing,said the committee would consider the request.   Graham and other committee members spent more than an hourquestioning Melvin J. Adams, the former director of the housingdepartment in Dade County, Fla., who said political contacts werethe key to winning Mod Rehab subsidies and that Dade County got morethan its fair share of the awards.   ``I thought it was not right but it was benefiting people Iwanted to provide housing for,'' Adams said. ``Had I just blown thewhistle, that's what I would have gotten _ nothing.''</TEXT></DOC>
