Both published literature andinformation obtained from Agency program office files were evaluatedas they pertained to potential human health, aquatic life, and environmentaleffects of hazardous waste constituents. Quantitative estimates are presentedprovided sufficient data are available. Carbon disulfide has been determinedto be a systemic toxicant. An Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for carbondisulfide is 0.1 mg/kg/day for oral exposure. The Reportable Quantity(RQ) value for carbon disulfide is 1000.</TEXT></DOC>
