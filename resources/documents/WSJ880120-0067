The tabloid daily, known as the Montreal Daily News, is scheduled to begin publication late next month or early in March. Terms of the investment by Mr. Maxwell weren't disclosed by Mr. Peladeau, and neither Mr. Maxwell nor spokesmen for him could be reached last night in London.    Montreal-based Quebecor, which is controlled by Mr. Peladeau, is a publishing and printing concern that already publishes Le Journal de Montreal, the city's largest French-language daily.    Last year, Quebecor and Mr. Maxwell's British Printing andamp; Communication Corp. jointly purchased a 55.3% stake in Donohue Inc., a Quebec City-based forest products concern, for 320 million Canadian dollars ($248.7 million).    Mr. Peladeau said that Mr. Maxwell will bring his &quot;technical skills and worthwhile knowledge&quot; to the venture. Among Mr. Maxwell's holdings is the Daily Mirror, a large-circulation British tabloid.    Mr. Peladeau said that Quebecor has budgeted an investment of 25 million dollars over five years for the new daily.    The Montreal Daily News will compete with the Gazette, currently Montreal's sole English-language daily. The Gazette is owned by Southam Inc., a Toronto-based publisher. </TEXT></DOC>
