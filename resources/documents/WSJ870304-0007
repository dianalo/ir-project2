Now the question is, do they really want it?    After a decade arguing that they were deploying U.S. missiles only to force the Soviet Union to trade away its medium-range nuclear weapons on the European continent, many European leaders reacted positively when Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev proposed just that idea on Saturday. But as the dust settles, Western European thinking about the so-called zero option appears to be more reserved than it initially appeared.    Government officials and defense analysts throughout Europe say that dismantling the mid-range weapons would bring substantial military risks for the Western alliance. But their fears aren't likely to translate into a vocal European opposition to a U.S.-Soviet pact. In the face of overwhelming public support for a missiles deal in most of Western Europe, government officials aren't in a position to appear obstructive on arms control.    &quot;The zero option was only proposed by the West in the first place because we believed that the Soviets would never go along with it,&quot; says David Bolton of London's Royal United Services Institute, a think tank partly funded by the government. &quot;Now they've accepted, and it looks like we're going to be bloody stuck with it.&quot;    West European reservations about dismantling the missiles stem from Soviet near-monopoly on short-range nuclear weapons, and East bloc conventional and chemical-weapons capabilities that aren't matched by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Some government officials also say Mr. Gorbachev is trying to divide the alliance by offering the U.S. a missiles deal on terms that West Europe dislikes.    As one top French official notes, &quot;Gorbachev has already succeeded in dividing us.&quot; NATO Secretary-General Lord Carrington, West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and leaders of Britain, Canada and Italy all responded favorably to Mr. Gorbachev's proposal within 48 hours of his speech. But NATO military commander Gen. Bernard Rogers said it would be &quot;disastrous&quot; to accept the proposal by itself. France also weighed in against, and officials in other corners of the West German government aren't echoing the Foreign Office stance.    &quot;We aren't afraid of the eagerness of President Reagan to get an agreement. We welcome that,&quot; says one security adviser to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. &quot;What we're afraid of is the kind of agreement (the U.S. and Soviets) will produce.&quot; Any pact that removes medium-range missiles without a separate accord on short-range missiles could leave Germany &quot;less secure,&quot; he adds.    As part of his proposals, Mr. Gorbachev offered to withdraw short-range Soviet missiles with a range of as much as 600 miles from East Germany and Czechoslovakia. NATO has nothing like these weapons, which were moved into their more-threatening forward positions after NATO's 1979 decision to deploy U.S. midrange missiles in Western Europe.    But even redeployed to Soviet territory, the short-range missiles &quot;can still hit West Germany&quot; and other NATO countries, notes a British government defense adviser. &quot;Moving them isn't enough.&quot;    British and French officials say they will be pressing the U.S. in the weeks ahead to try to get a better deal on the short-range missiles. They may have a better idea of what they are up against when the U.S. begins presenting its counterproposals today to Soviet negotiators at Geneva, Switzerland. President Reagan yesterday welcomed the Gorbachev proposal and said he had directed U.S. negotiators to begin talks on eliminating both sides' medium-range missiles from Europe.    Despite being the most directly threatened, the Germans say they aren't making a separate agreement on short-range missiles a condition for their acceptance of a Euromissiles pact. Bonn officials say only that they want a &quot;promise&quot; built into any agreement that the U.S. and Soviets would later negotiate the short-range question. Denmark also says it will look for such a guarantee.    In France, both the Socialist and conservative arms of government see other dangers in the huge Soviet conventional-arms and troop advantage in Europe, which would loom larger after a missiles deal. Government officials say they'd be pleased if the new proposals were just talked to death.    But most defense pundits in Europe don't think that's likely. They believe that President Reagan's battered presidency is eager for the popularity boost that an arms pact would give. And European public opinion may be so in favor of an accord as to make it difficult for governments to resist. A recent poll in Britain's Guardian newspaper showed that an average of 65% of those surveyed in Britain, France, Italy and West Germany disapproved of European basing of U.S. missiles.    &quot;It will be politically difficult for Britain and West Germany to be seen as opposing a pullout on any grounds,&quot; says John Roper of London's Royal Institute for International Affairs, a foreign-policy research concern. &quot;The public will say, `You told us that this is what you wanted all along, and now that the Soviets are ready to give it, you won't take it.'&quot;    One British government official says the allies are counting on the U.S. not to portray European objections as an impediment to an accord. With Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher facing a national election sometime this year, says this official, &quot;I don't think Washington would put us in that position.&quot;    There's also a powerful European sense that despite possible military disadvantages, the West should accept what it perceives as a breakthrough move by Mr. Gorbachev as a stepping stone to more-important arms control in the future. His dropping an earlier condition tying a medium-range pact to U.S. abandonment of Star Wars research is viewed as a major concession.    &quot;The government, the Parliament and most of the people think we're at the beginning of a broader process of gradual reduction of arms, both nuclear and conventional, and they think that's a good thing,&quot; says Enrico Jacchia, director of the Center for Strategic Studies in Rome. The Italians realize the Russians have ulterior motives, says Mr. Jacchia, but &quot;the reaction here is `this is good, this is new, let's rejoice. It will be a complicated negotiation, but it's a good thing.'&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
