(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A pastor appealed Sunday for spiritualunderstanding of the terrorists holding nine Americans hostage inthe Middle East as an interdenominational service pondered news fromLebanon.   ``Oh, God of all people, teach us how to pray now for those weidentify as enemies in our lives,'' said the Rev. Thomas Kojis, whowas aboard a jetliner in Greece that was damaged by a terrorist bombin 1986.   Kojis, pastor of the Wauwatosa Avenue United Methodist Church,was among seven clergy of several denominations participating in aprayer service for the hostages at the Underwood Memorial BaptistChurch in Wauwatosa, a Milwaukee suburb.   Kojis said he wanted to discuss the captors as well and whatmight have motivated them to take Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He was captured March 16,1985, and is the longest-held U.S. hostage.   A videotape in which Anderson says President Reagan and VicePresident George Bush have not done enough to secure his releasesurfaced last Monday. Sunday's event was planned for several monthsand was not intended as a political message, said the Rev. ReidTrulson, pastor at the host church. About 50 people attended.   They spoke about Anderson and the other hostages, the hostages'families and those negotiating for their release with shadowycaptors.   ``Part of us wants to destroy our enemies, terminate them, wipethem off the face of the earth. Part of us is blinded in the darkabout who the captors really are,'' Kojis said. ``Some of us herehave neatly divided the situation into two camps: us and them.''   ``Deeper than those things that divide us from the captors, thereis that which unites us. We are all brothers and sisters,'' he said.   Kojis said he and his family have had time to recover since abomb exploded across the aisle from them in a TWA jetliner April 2,1986, killing four occupants.   When he heard what the other pastors planned to say during thememorial service, he said, he chose to concentrate on the captorsbecause ``it was going involve a lot of reflection.''   ``To try to walk in your enemies' shoes, to empathize, whichseems so difficult,'' he said. ``How do you walk in the shoes ofyour captor? I think those are all the challenges that await us infaith.''   Anderson was a particular focus of the service because of theattention surrounding his recent birthday, the videotape, and newphotographs of him distributed last month.   One photo was delivered to a Western news agency Friday alongwith a statement from the Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, sayingWashington would not take ``realistic steps'' to end the ordeal of14 captives held in Lebanon, nine of whom are American.   In the most recent photograph Anderson is pictured before abirthday cake. Oct. 27 was his 41st birthday.</TEXT></DOC>
