Levine, the former investment bankerwhose squealings led to Wall Street's biggest insider tradingscandal, was freed from prison Tuesday and transferred to awork-furlough program.   Kenneth Treon, a counselor at the Lewisburg federal prison campin Lewisburg, Pa., where Levine had been confined since April 1987,said by telephone that a relative of Levine's picked him up Tuesdaymorning for the drive to New York, about 150 miles to the east.   ``He had a clear conduct record,'' Treon said. ``He had noviolations of institution rules or records. He did what he wastold.''   Treon said Levine, who is in the midst of a two-year prisonterm, was released under a halfway-house program for inmates withinsix months of their parole date. He said the program ``enables aman to enter back into society by assisting them with possible jobopportunities.''   Unescorted by guards, Levine left to go to a halfway house forfederal inmates in the New York area, said Kathryn Morse, a Bureauof Prisons spokeswoman in Washington. She declined to identify thefacility until Wednesday after Levine had reported there, inaccordance with federal rules.   Levine's attorney, Martin Flumenbaum, also declined to identifythe facility except to say it was in New York. He also declined tospeculate on what type of work Levine hoped to do.   Formerly a mergers specialist at the investment firm DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc., Levine was arrested in May 1986 after theSecurities and Exchange Commission accused him of making $12.6million in profits through illegal trading on inside information.   Levine was sentenced to two years in prison on charges ofsecurities fraud, tax evasion and perjury. He is eligible forparole beginning this September.   Whatever work Levine does, it will not be related to WallStreet. Under an SEC order against him, spokesman Chiles Larsonsaid, Levine ``is barred from any participation in any form of thesecurities business, in any capacity.''   It was Levine's cooperation with federal authorities that ledthem to Wall Street speculator Ivan F. Boesky, who used sensitiveinformation provided by Levine to profit on insider trading himself.   Boesky paid the SEC a record $100 million in illicit insidertrading profits and penalties in November 1986. He is now serving athree-year federal prison term for conspiracy to lie to the SEC.   Both men provided extensive information to prosecutors andimplicated other securities professionals in a widespread insidertrading scandal that jolted Wall Street and raised a clamor aboutethics in the financial world.   Last month, Boesky was temporarily transferred from a prisoncamp in Lompoc, Calif., to a New York correctional facility. JohnVeltri, Lompoc's assistant superintendent, said Boesky had beenreturned to Lompoc last Friday.   Boesky's presence in New York raised speculation he wastestifying before a federal grand jury about John Mulheren, a stocktrader arrested in February on charges he intended to kill Boeskyfor implicating him in the scandal.   Under federal speedy-trial rules, Mulheren had a right to anindictment by Tuesday, unless he granted prosecutor requests formore time. Thomas Puccio, Mulheren's attorney, said he agreed onTuesday to a three-week extension.</TEXT></DOC>
