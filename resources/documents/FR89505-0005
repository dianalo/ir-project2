Joseph, Senior StaffVeterinarian, Veterinary Biologics, Biotechnology, Biologics, and EnvironmentalProtection, APHIS, USDA, Room 838, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road,Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436-6332.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The moisture content of a desiccated biological product is related to thestability of that product during its dating period. In order to providea uniform method of determining moisture content in desiccated products,a test procedure was published in andSection; 113.29 of the regulations in1973. This test procedure was considered the most accurate and reproducibletest method available at that time. All manufacturers of such productsare currently required to determine moisture content of desiccated productsusing this procedure. The procedure takes 2 days to complete and requiresspecial laboratory equipment not normally used in other tests. The veterinarybiologics industry and APHIS have gained much knowledge and experiencetesting products during the past 15 years. Other means of determining moisturecontent during the production process have been developed which are morerapid and less expensive than the test method specified in the regulations.Lyophilizers installed in some manufacturing facilities are equipped withhighly sophisticated sensors and modules that monitor temperature, air,time, and vacuum pressure at shelf level. Some are equipped to measuretemperature of selected vials during the drying process. Most are equippedto stopper and seal vials before internal vacuum is broken thus preventingthe introduction of external moisture. Each product is unique and an acceptablerange for moisture has been established by manufacturers for each of theirproducts. The desiccating cycles can be adjusted to the criteria establishedfor each product.Other assurances are also employed by the manufacturer and APHIS to determinethe stability of biological products. Eligibility for release of a serialrequires that the product have predetermined titers at release and throughoutthe dating period. These titers are confirmed by the manufacturer and theNational Veterinary Services Laboratories. Section 114.13 of the regulationsrequires the expiration period to be confirmed by satisfactory potencytests on a significant number of serials at the end of the expected datingperiod. In few instances when the moisture content exceeds the stated requirement,serials can be released provided that the potency is shown to be satisfactoryat mid-dating and at the end of the dating period. Under this amendment,procedures employed by manufacturers to determine moisture content willbe specified on a product-by-product basis in the Outline of Productionas an in-process test in accordance with andSection; 114.9(d).<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments Received</ITAG>On August 19, 1988, we published a proposal in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (49 FR 31704-31705, Docket No. 88-084) discussingthis revision and soliciting comments.We solicited comments concerning the proposal for 60 days ending October18, 1988, and received eight comments. Comments were received from fivelicensed manufacturers, one unlicensed manufacturer, a consultant to biologicmanufacturers, and the National Trade Association for the major U.S. manufacturersof animal health products, including biological products. None opposedadoption of the proposed amendment.Several commenters requested a clarification of the in-process test(s)which must be specified in the Outline of Production approved for filingby APHIS for each product. The amendment will allow each manufacturer toselect an alternative method that has been shown to be at least as accurateas the current test procedure in measuring residual moisture content indesiccated biological products. A description of the test method alongwith supporting data must be submitted to APHIS for approval. The commentersalso observed that the wording in the proposed amendment refers to a ``minimum''moisture content. The concern should be for the maximum residual moisturecontent established for each product. The wording in andSection; 113.29 hasbeen corrected in that respect. In addition, the second sentence of theproposed amendment has been revised to more accurately reflect the intentof the proposal and to clarify the wording of the regulation. The amendatorylanguage in action No. 3 has been changed to ensure that the paragraphsin andSection; 113.64 are properly designated.These changes are editorial and do not substantively change the proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>This action has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 and DepartmentalRegulation 1512-1 and has been classified as not a ``Major Rule.'' Thefinal rule will have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million;will not result in a major increase in costs or prices to consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State, or local Government agencies, or geographicregions; and will not cause a significant adverse effect on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability ofUnited States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprisesin domestic markets. This action will provide for flexibility in methodsused to monitor moisture content of desiccated veterinary biological productsby not requiring a specific test procedure.The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service hasdetermined that this action will not result in adverse economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. Its purpose is to update theStandard Requirements for the production of veterinary biological products.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372</ITAG>The program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372,which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.(See 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V).<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This final rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirementsunder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 113</ITAG>Animal biologics.Accordingly, we are amending 9 CFR Part 113 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 113_STANDARD REQUIREMENTS</ITAG>1.
