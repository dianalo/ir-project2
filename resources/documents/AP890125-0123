Hector Aguililla Saladrigas, 35, broke with the revolution lastOctober when he was granted political asylum by U.S. officials, buthis defection was not publicly disclosed until the State Departmentmade him available for an interview Tuesday with The AssociatedPress.   Aguililla criticized the corruption that he said Cuban officialsengaged in while he was posted in Syria and Iran and added he wastroubled by the lack of freedom and the ``total militarization'' ofCuban society.   The Cuban diplomatic mission here was apprised of Aguililla'sallegations on Wednesday but spokesman Angel Pino refused comment.   President Fidel Castro has acknowledged that corruption in Cubais a problem but he nonetheless contends that the revolution hasproduced hundreds of thousands of selfless individuals who volunteerfor social welfare projects at home and in numerous Third Worldcountries.   Aguililla, whose diplomatic career spanned 14 years, offered arare glimpse into the role Cuba has played in cooperation withPalestinian radicals in the shadowy international arms traffickingbusiness.   Aguililla said that with Palestinian help, Cuba has arranged forthe transport of large quantities of Western-made weaponry toguerrilla groups in El Salvador, Guatemala and Chile and alsoprovides training in Cuba for leftist African groups.   He said that between 1980 and 1983 while he served as the secondranking official at the Cuban Embassy in Damascus, he routinely madetrips to Lebanon's Bekka Valley where the trunk of his car wasloaded with rifles, pistols, revolvers and smoke bombs.   He said Palestinian groups, particularly two pro-Marxistfactions, were the principal source of weaponry, which he was ableto transport back to Syria without a customs check because of thediplomatic plates on his car.   On occasion, he said, a top Cuban intelligence officer flew toDamascus for larger-scale arms transfers.   Weapons of U.S., Israeli or Italian manufacture were favoredbecause ``socialist involvement'' in the arms trafficking schemecould thus be concealed, he said.   ``The Palestinians were a good source of Western arms becausethey had a lot of contacts to get them,'' he added.   ``The policy of Cuba has always been to export the revolution,''Aguililla said as he recounted his experiences in the 75-minuteinterview.   Speaking in Spanish while chain-smoking cigarettes, Aguilillasaid he does not know if the arms smuggling operation by way ofSyria continued beyond 1983 because he left the country in early1984.   He said Cuba assists the Palestinian movement in a number ofways, including the provision of ``training of a terrorist nature.''   Palestinians, he said, are trained by Cubans as frogmen and inthe use of ``all types of weaponry'' as well. Non-lethal skills alsoare taught, such as how to falsify passports and to engage inclandestine correspondence through an invisible writing technique.   Aguililla was assigned last September to be the second rankingofficial at the Cuban Embassy in Madagascar. He departed Cuba onOctober 10 but at a transit point en route, which he refused todisclose, he asked for political asylum for his wife and twochildren, aged 13 and 10.   He described Castro as ``paranoid'' and ``capricious'' and saidhe was disturbed by widespread evidence of corruption in Cubansociety, sometimes at high levels of government.   Wilma Espin, a member of the Politburo and head of the Federationof Cuban Women, once helped herself during a visit to Damascus to afund that embassy women had contributed to for parties and toys forchildren, he said, adding that she used the money for shopping.   Orlando Fundora, formerly the chief ideologue of the revolution,stopped once in Damascus, Aguililla said, and asked him to exchangemoney on the black market.   ``He was supposed to be the model of socialist morality butnonethless he violated the law of that country,'' Aguililla added.   The wife of a former Cuban ambassador to Syria, Arturo BarberOrosco, used to finance shopping expeditions by drawing thousands ofdollars from an embassy fund and saying the money was being used for``cleaning materials'' for the ambassador's residence, Aguilillasaid.</TEXT></DOC>
