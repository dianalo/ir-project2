The action came one day after the Bush administration announced aban on imports of several foreign-made semiautomatic weapons thatpolice say have contributed to a nationwide wave of drug-relatedkillings. Calls for controls also increased after an assault riflewas used in the California schoolyard attack that killed fivechildren earlier this year.   Administration officials said the move may just be temporary, butthat with import applications skyrocketing, they wanted to head offan imminent surge of the deadly firearms entering the country.   Colt's voluntary move to halt AR15 sales was lauded by William J.Bennett, the nation's drug control director, as ``an act of civicresponsibility.''   Dick Pedersen of the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco and Firearms added, ``It's amazing how this thing is justtaking off.''   Bennett on Tuesday announced the suspension of pending importpermits for more than 110,000 semiautomatic rifles until the ATF canreview if their intended use fits the requirement that they be sportweapons.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked Wednesday if thepresident would expand the review to domestic models, said, ``Thereare no plans of that kind anticipated.''   But Dunn said Colt will permanently halt sales of the AR15 tocivilians ``if it is determined by the government review thatsemiautomatic rifles are not appropriate for the commercialmarket.'' He would not reveal how many of the rifles Colt makes.   Gregg Risch of Handgun Control, one of the country's leading guncontrol advocates, called the move by Colt ``unprecedented.''   But when asked about the possible impact on crime, Risch said,``Zero.''   ``There are a couple of million of them already out on thestreets, gun stores already have large stocks of ones alreadyimported and domestically made ones, and yesterday's action doesn'tdo anything to stop them from selling those,'' Risch said.   Gwynne Peirson, retired professor of criminology at HowardUniversity and a police officer for 23 years in Oakland, Calif.,said the ban on imports will have no immediate impact, butultimately could if it is made permanent.   ``It will have to trickle down and we may not even see the impactnext year,'' he said. ``The only thing the ban will do in the shortrun is to increase the price of the available weapons.''   The National Rifle Association said halting imports will havelittle impact on crime. It said the government is targetinglaw-abiding citizens and their guns, not criminals who will ignoregun-control laws anyway.   ``If we leave this guy out on the street, he operates outside ofall of our laws and he sneers at society and he's going to be amajor problem,'' said Wayne LaPierre, executive director of the NRAInstitute for Legislative Action.   The Colt AR15 is the most similar U.S.-made weapon to thosecovered by the import ban, such as semiautomatic versions of AK-47sand Uzi carbines, Pedersen said.   The suspension on imports does not affect thousands of othersemiautomatic rifles awaiting import permits, he said. ``The onesthat don't look like automatic weapons are still coming in,'' hesaid.   The NRA maintains that only cosmetic differences exist betweenthe different weapons.   Pedersen agreed with the NRA that it is extremely difficult toconvert such weapons into fully automatic guns, as members ofCongress and gun control advocates elsewhere have contended.   According to estimates by the NRA and gun control activists,there are 60 million to 70 million firearms in private hands in theUnited States, including 20 million to 30 million semiautomaticweapons ranging from pistols to the assault-style rifles.   But it is unclear exactly how many semiautomatic rifles areproduced in the United States, as manufacturers are not required toreport their output with such detail, Pedersen said.   In 1987, the United States produced a total of 1.76 millionhandguns and 1.01 million rifles, including regular bolt and pumpaction armaments as well as semiautomatics, Pedersen said. That wasa 300,000 jump in both categories _ handguns and rifles _ from theprevious year, and officials believe the number probably increasedin 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
