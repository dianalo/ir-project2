Continued speculation that the Federal Reserve is easing credit and predictions by Reagan administration officials that the U.S. trade deficit will decline this year helped bolster bond prices, several traders said. Some actively traded issues rose by half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount.    &quot;The market smells Fed ease,&quot; said David C. Matthews, a vice president at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank in Chicago.    The Federal Reserve's policy committee met yesterday and Tuesday to outline strategy. A Fed spokesman declined to comment, as usual. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is scheduled to give his mid-year economic report at a House Banking Committee hearing on Feb. 23.    Trading volume was lethargic yesterday. Many investment managers are apprehensive about a government report to be released tomorrow morning showing the nation's merchandise trade deficit for December. Some also are nervous about a Commerce Department report to be released this morning on retail sales for January.    Tomorrow's trade report is expected by most analysts in several recent surveys to show the December deficit was about the same as November's $13.2 billion gap. But few forecasters have much faith in their own forecasts. Previous trade reports frequently have astonished both traders and investors, sending bond and stock markets into a tizzy.    Some traders were encouraged by Secretary of State George Shultz's prediction yesterday that the trade deficit eventually &quot;will come down.&quot; Speaking in Washington, Mr. Shultz didn't say when, but he contended that the deficit eventually could come down more rapidly than many economists predict.    Estimates for the trade report vary enormously. Some analysts say the deficit could be low as $11.5 billion, while others say it was $15 billion or higher.    If the trade deficit comes in close to what is generally expected, that will greatly increase the chances that the Federal Reserve will cut its discount rate soon, said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. The discount rate, which is 6%, is the rate the Fed charges on loans to banks and savings institutions.    &quot;There is a lot of concern about the economy,&quot; Mr. Brusca said. Also, the dollar's recent strength gives the Fed more leeway to reduce short-term rates, he said. Then there are political considerations: &quot;Chairman Greenspan would find his testimony before the House and Senate Banking committees would go a lot easier if he had taken back the discount rate increase he engineered early last September, particularly given subsequent events.&quot;    The Fed &quot;will cut the discount rate before Feb. 23 -- and it could even cut it as soon as this Friday,&quot; Mr. Brusca predicted. Several traders cited this forecast, which was carried on the Dow Jones Capital Markets Report yesterday, as one factor in yesterday's bond rally.    For today's retail sales report, most forecasters expect little or no change. According to the average estimate of a dozen analysts polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, retail sales fell 0.1% last month, reflecting weakness in auto sales. Excluding autos, a 0.3% rise is expected.    &quot;The prevalent belief is that rates will be lower a month or two down the road,&quot; said William M. Brachfeld, executive vice president of Daiwa Securities America Inc.    Long-term Treasury bonds now yield about 8.3%, the lowest in more than nine months. That is down from 8.34% Tuesday and as much as 10 1/2% last October when the stock market collapsed. Since Jan. 12, prices of 30-year Treasury issues have jumped nearly 10 points, or almost $100 for each $1,000 face amount.    The Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due in 2017 rose yesterday to a price of 106 10/32 from 105 28/32 Tuesday. The Treasury's 8 1/8% notes due 1998 rose to 100 6/32 from 99 28/ 32, and the yield declined to 8.10% from 8.14%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 5.22 points to 1329.29. It hovered between 1330.68 and 1323.28.    The federal funds rate, as expected, declined again. The rate on funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged 5.80%, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. That was down from 6.04% Tuesday and 6.58% Monday.    Traders attributed yesterday's unusually large drop in the funds rate mainly to technical factors that have caused the banking system to be flush with funds temporarily. Yesterday was the end of a two-week bank reserve accounting period; the funds rate often is exceptionally volatile on the final day of such periods. The funds rate fell despite a move by the Federal Reserve to drain reserves from the banking system. At the time, funds were trading at 5 3/4%.    Earlier this year, federal funds were trading around 6 3/4%. Lately, though, the Fed appears to be easing credit conditions very slightly, according to many analysts. As a result, they expect the funds rate to hover close to 6 1/2%.    Rates on short-term Treasury bills were little changed yesterday. The rate on six-month bills dipped to 5.83% bid from 5.84% Tuesday. The latest three-month bills were quoted late yesterday at 5.59% bid, unchanged from Tuesday. </TEXT></DOC>
