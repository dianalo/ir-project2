In this study, we present the first direct in vivo analysisof the interaction of a DNA repair enzyme, T4 endonuclease V, and itssubstrate, pyrimidine dimer-containing plasmid DNA, within UV-irradiatedE. coli. A pyrimidine dimer represents a small target site within largedomains of DNA. There are two possible paradigms by which endonucleaseV could locate these small target sites: a processive mechanism in whichthe enzyme scans DNA for dimer sites or a distributive process in whichdimers are located by random three-dimensional diffusion. In order todiscriminate between these two possibilities in E. coli, an in vivo DNArepair assay was developed to study the kinetics of plasmid DNA repairand the dimer frequency (i.e. the number of dimer sites on a given plasmidmolecule) in plasmid DNA as a function of time during repair. Our resultsdemonstrate that the overall process of plasmid DNA repair initiatedby T4 endonuclease V (expressed from a recombinant plasmid within repair-deficientE. coli) occurs by a processive mechanism. Furthermore, by reducing thetemperature of the repair incubation, the endonuclease V-catalyzed incisionstep has been effectively decoupled from the subsequent steps includingrepair patch synthesis, ligation, and supercoiling. By this manipulation,it was determined that the overall processive mechanism is composed oftwo phases: a rapid processive endonuclease V-catalyzed incision reaction,followed by a slower processive mechanism, the ultimate product of whichis the dimer-free supercoiled plasmid molecule.</TEXT></DOC>
