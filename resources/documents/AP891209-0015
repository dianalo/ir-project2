Mason met with Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., in a very public lunchFriday that Mason said was aimed at creating a higher profile forSpecter, though his re-election campaign isn't until 1992.   Specter said he and Mason had met last year in Washington forlunch _ ``I still have the receipt in my pocket,'' the senatorcracked _ and they have stayed in touch since then.   ``All my life I heard there was no such thing as a free lunch.But whenever I see a senator eating, he's eating for free,'' Masonsaid.   The two men posed for photographs after lunch at Elaine's andSpecter said he was unworried about any fallout. Mason createdproblems for GOP mayoral hopeful Rudolph Giuliani earlier in theyear with a perceived slur against blacks.   ``Jackie's speaking for himself. I'll deny everything Jackiesays,'' Specter joked.   Though Mason was apologetic after his remarks during thecampaign, he was back to his nose-thumbing self on Friday.   ``It's the same jokes I told on Broadway for two years. I got aTony Award for those jokes,'' said Mason.</TEXT></DOC>
