They recall that less than two years ago, he was parading captured &quot;illegales&quot; before television cameras at the border and warning about &quot;invasions&quot; from the south.    But times have changed, and so, for the moment, has Mr. Ezell. After building his public image on purging the U.S. of the undocumented, Mr. Ezell has become a champion of amnesty. The critics still don't like him, but most of them concede that for now at least he has switched from being the immigration service's top Western cop to tutoring immigrants and employers about the ins and outs of the new immigration law.    This particular afternoon, in an appearance at a storefront legalization office, Mr. Ezell is fielding questions for a live Spanish-language radio broadcast, clucking over babies and autographing 8-by-10 glossies of himself. His performance is part of a campaign to persuade undocumented workers to apply for immigration amnesty before the May 4 deadline.    &quot;Our borders are out of control,&quot; the 51-year-old Mr. Ezell says. &quot;Congress and the American people have said they want them back. That's what IRCA {the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986} is all about, and that's my job.&quot;    When Mr. Ezell joined the INS in 1983, he lacked a college degree, background in government, foreign-language skills and law-enforcement experience. But he was a former executive with the Wienerschnitzel hot-dog chain and a cohort of Attorney General Edwin Meese III, who befriended him in the late 1960s, when Ronald Reagan was the governor of California. He quickly became a friend and political ally of INS Commissioner Alan C. Nelson as well.    Five years later, Mr. Ezell's influence on immigration policy far outstrips his title. Blunt, enthusiastic and a born marketer, he has become the most visible immigration official in years. By using the media to spread his message, he is helping to reshape national policy as the U.S. struggles to recast a 212-year-old relationship with its immigrants.    But Mr. Ezell has a lot to live down. Early in his tenure, the drownings of some field workers in California's central valley stirred considerable public concern. The workers had panicked and jumped into irrigation ditches to elude border-patrol agents. In the face of press criticism, Mr. Ezell initially refused to equip his agents with lifesaving gear because, he said, it &quot;would only encourage&quot; others to flee. But he eventually capitulated. &quot;That just shows we're flexible,&quot; he says now.    A couple of years ago, Democratic Sen. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona sent a sharp letter to Commissioner Nelson criticizing Mr. Ezell for referring -- in the senator's presence -- to undocumented immigrants as &quot;wets,&quot; short for the slur &quot;wetback.&quot; (Mr. Ezell says that he doesn't remember the incident and that the term &quot;isn't in my vocabulary.&quot;)    And, in a now-famous 1986 interview, Mr. Ezell gave this advice about the best way to prosecute aliens who use or sell fraudulent entry documents: &quot;If you catch 'em, you ought to clean 'em and fry 'em yourself.&quot;    Mr. Ezell received reprimands from Washington, but he kept his job. &quot;He couldn't have survived his hate-filled and racist statements unless they considered him a success,&quot; says Father Luis Olivares, a powerful immigrant-rights advocate who presides over the largest Catholic congregation in Los Angeles.    Mr. Ezell calls charges that he is racist &quot;cheap shots.&quot; As for Commissioner Nelson, he praises Mr. Ezell's aggressiveness. &quot;Clearly, Hal Ezell is an important part of the immigration service,&quot; he says. He concedes that some of Mr. Ezell's comments have been &quot;dumb&quot; or &quot;inappropriate,&quot; but he says that &quot;it's a heck of a lot better to have to pull the reins in rather than hit the mule to get him running.&quot; (He quickly adds: &quot;I'm not comparing Hal to a mule, though.&quot;)    Many people believe that Mr. Ezell acts as a lightning rod for the commissioner and other senior Reagan administration officials. But by publicly challenging the agency's opponents, pushing hard-line policies and wooing the press, Mr. Ezell promotes the INS in a way that the more reserved and courtly Mr. Nelson would find impossible.    Mr. Ezell doesn't limit his crusade to federal policy. When the Los Angeles city council approved a resolution declaring the city a sanctuary for Central American refugees, Mr. Ezell threatened to find ways to cut off some of the city's federal funds. His well-publicized attack, followed by a flood of protests from Angelenos, forced the council to back down.    &quot;To Hal, it's a black-and-white world,&quot; says John Galardi, a longtime friend and the founder of the Wienerschnitzel chain. &quot;There are very few guys running around with gray hats.&quot;    Among Mr. Ezell's personal heroes is Abraham Lincoln, with whom he shares a birthday. But above all, Mr. Ezell admires his late father, who was a minister with a Pentecostal Assemblies of God church in Wilmington, Calif. &quot;My dad taught me to respect the law,&quot; he says. &quot;God says to obey laws, and it's as simple as that.&quot;    Mr. Ezell's tenure at the INS has spawned a large and determined group of opponents. Two Democrats, Sen. Alan Cranston of California and Rep. John J. Moakley of Massachusetts, as well as many immigrant-rights advocates, have demanded Mr. Ezell's resignation at several points. Now that Mr. Ezell portrays himself as the ally of immigrants and employers, those demands come less frequently. But critics still charge him with gross insensitivity and wonder aloud how long the current chummy phase will last.    &quot;Ezell isn't a man of reason,&quot; says Linda Wong, the associate counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. &quot;He appeals to people's emotions, and that's the danger he presents. It's difficult to forge any comprehensive policy on immigration with people who react on stereotypes.&quot;    Some minority-group leaders concede that Mr. Ezell's continuing influence may point to underlying problems in their own efforts. &quot;In many ways, Harold Ezell is a good example of what's wrong with us,&quot; says Arnold Torres, a longtime activist and policy consultant. Mr. Torres calls Mr. Ezell's sombrero-assisted amnesty pitches and other controversial gestures &quot;unacceptable,&quot; and says flatly, &quot;The only reason that these things happen is because we let them.&quot;    But most activists say that they have to choose their battles carefully. For the moment, they are putting their campaigns to oust Mr. Ezell on hold because of the demands of the amnesty program. They add that public sentiment toward immigrants has worsened in recent years, making it more difficult to take Mr. Ezell to task.    Indisputably, Mr. Ezell's public-relations efforts have revitalized the INS's Western region, which includes Guam, California, Hawaii, Arizona and Nevada. His background as a businessman helped him reduce a paper-work backlog and improve indifferent service to the public. He also recruited veteran INS managers from retirement and districts outside Los Angeles to provide him with everything from enforcement know-how to Spanish translation skills for publicity swings.    More important, Mr. Ezell's business savvy and cheerleading skills have injected a new team spirit in the region's 6,000 employees. His openness and go-get-'em attitude are a radical change for the INS, which has suffered for years as the stepchild of the federal government.    His recent push for amnesty, though, has led to grumbling. Some lower-level employees charge that Mr. Ezell is a &quot;vendido,&quot; or sellout. And according to his wife, Lee, &quot;Even some old friends don't understand why Hal is supporting the immigrants for amnesty.&quot; Mr. Ezell just responds that &quot;the law is the law. I didn't sell out to anyone.&quot;    Some of the sniping probably stems from rivalry. While a large proportion of the country's undocumented workers are concentrated in the Western region, Mr. Ezell and his troops have clearly done a lot to publicize the yearlong amnesty program. The region has contributed about 60% of the 1.4 million amnesty applications submitted since last May. At the same time, the national publicity efforts of the INS in general have been widely criticized.    Mr. Ezell ackowledges that being in the limelight has its pitfalls. Protesters have picketed the Ezells' house in Laguna Niguel. Mr. Ezell also claims that he has sometimes been misrepresented in the press.    Mrs. Ezell, a Christian author and lecturer, says that some people have withdrawn speaking invitations to her when they discovered that she was married to &quot;the&quot; Harold Ezell of the INS. She explains her husband's perseverance by saying, &quot;He's really a caring person, and it's a challenge to him.&quot;    Over the years, Mr. Ezell has suffered several personal tragedies. His first wife, the mother of his two adult daughters, died from a brain tumor, and his second wife died of lupus, a chronic degenerative disease. (He has been married to his third wife for 14 years.)    Mr. Ezell knows that his tenure at the INS could end with a shift in the political wind. Will he be able to give up the glare of the television lights when the time comes?    Mr. Ezell glances out his office window at Old Glory and the INS flag snapping in the ocean breeze. &quot;I guess I'd like to go back into the private sector and maybe rescue a troubled company,&quot; Mr. Ezell says. &quot;Like Lee Iacocca. He's another one of my heroes.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
