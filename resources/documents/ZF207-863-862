(President's Letter)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Kocher, Bryan; Strimpel, Oliver.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><NOTE>Only Text is presented here; see printed issues for graphics.andO;</NOTE><TEXT>Computers Belong in a MuseumandM;A unique piece of computer history was displayed at the Computer ScienceConference in February 1989.andP;  Just across the aisle from the latest advancesby Sun, Hewlett-Packard, and NeXT sat a reminder of the immense progress thatcomputing has achieved in just 40 years.andP;  The Computer Science Conference(CSC) attendees in Louisville, Kentucky were privileged to inspect a recentlyrenovated UNIVAC I. This sentinel from the dawn of the computer age waslocated, restored, and exhibited at CSC through the efforts of ACMvolunteers.andM;The UNIVAC I was manufactured circa 1950 and marked the beginning ofcommercial computing.andP;  Only 48 UNIVAC Is were built, at a cost of $1 millioneach by the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Company.andP;  ACM's second President, JohnMauchly, was a founder of Eckert-Mauchley, which became part of what is nowthe UNISYS Corporation.andP;  Although a contemporary of the ERA 1101 in the U.S.andO;and the LEO I in the United Kingdom, the UNIVAC I was the first computerwidely recognized by the public.andP;  Its fame came, in part, from correctlypredicting the 1952 landslide election victory by Eisenhower.andM;The UNIVAC I was located in the garage of Mrs. Sarah Lawson ofGoodlettsville, Tennessee, nearly a year before the Computer ScienceConference.andP;  Mrs. Lawson contacted Gwen Bell, President of the ComputerMuseum in Boston, Massachusetts, who enlisted CSC Chairman Arthur Riehl, aprofessor at the University of Louisville, and Program Chairman JohnMcGregor, a professor at Murray State University, to renovate the machine.andO;Art and John arranged for shipment to Louisville and assembled a team torefurbish the equipment for display.andP;  Major parts of the restoration workwere handled by ACM student members Jennifer and David Blackwell.andP;  After CSC,the UNIVAC I was shipped to Boston to become part of the Computer Museum'spermanent collection.andM;Saving a major piece of computing history is just one of the ways ACM and theComputer Museum work together.andP;  Over the last 12 months ACM and the ComputerMuseum collaborated on three other projects of significance to both computingpractitioners and the general public.andM;In January, this magazine's cover story was the Computer Museum's ComputerBowl.andP;  The Computer Bowl is a TV-game-show style fund-raising event for theComputer Museum.andP;  It tests the computer trivia knowledge of two teams ofcomputer industry celebrities representing the East and West coasts.andP;  Lastyear's contestants included Esther Dyson, Casey Powell, Mitch Kapor, BillJoy, Allen Michels, and Bill Poduska.andP;  Not only was this the most popularrecent issue of Communications, but it was also one of the most popularprograms of the PBS &quot;Computer Chronicles&quot; series.andP;  It showed a light andhuman side to the serious business of computing.andP;  Coverage of this contestspread to the popular press, including Fortune, the Wall Street Journal,Business Week, and USA Today.andP;  (ACM will be a major sponsor of the 1990Computer Bowl.)andM;Last fall, ACM's SIGGRAPH awarded the Museum a grant to bring to the Museumsix hands-on interactive exhibits on computer graphics.andP;  This SIGGRAPHdonation became &quot;The Interactive Image&quot; exhibit, which features computeranimation, symmetry, image-processing, fractals, graftals, and art.andP;  &quot;TheInteractive Image&quot; was developed by the Electronics Visualization Lab at theUniversity of Chicago under the direction of Tom DeFanti.andP;  The exhibit isextremely popular with Museum visitors because of its well-designed contentand easy-to-use video game interface.andM;This summer, ACM's SIGGRAPH brought another exhibition to the ComputerMuseum's galleries.andP;  The 1989 ACM SIGGRAPH Art Show is on display untilJanuary 5, 1990.andP;  During its six-month sojourn, more than 50,000 people willsee the show.andP;  The Art Show is bringing a new audience to the Museum.andP;  Oncewithin the museum's doors, many are stimulated to discover the technologybehind graphics and computer art in Museum galleries such as &quot;The Computerand the Image&quot; and &quot;Smart Machines.&quot;andM;The Computer Museum is providing important support to an ACM-sponsoredproject, a six-part series on PBS about the history of computing.andP;  The seriesof six one-hour programs, entitled &quot;The Information Age,&quot; will air in thefall of 1991.andP;  You may have seen the full-page advertisement in the September11, 1989 issue of the Wall Street Journal, announcing the series that publictelevision station WGBH has in production and our sponsorship of &quot;TheInformation Age.&quot;andP;  The WGBH producers will be using the Computer Museum as aprimary resource on the history of computing and are intrigued with the ideaof using a planned exhibit of the world's only &quot;walk-through computer&quot; in theshow.andP;  This one-of-a-kind exhibit, showing how computers work, potentiallyprovides a dramatic set for part of this television special.andM;The public outreach of the Computer Museum helps the computing professionaddress the crisis in computing education.andP;  It helps to attract the best andbrightest young minds into software engineering and computer science.andP;  Italso helps to educate the computer-phobic public, who can infect young peoplewith the terrible virus of dislike and distrust.andP;  ACM's work with theComputer Museum helps us celebrate our past, provides education andentertainment in the present, and offers a glimpse of the future of computingthat will help attract the best young people into our profession.andM;You can help preserve the history of the computing profession and extend itshorizons by:andM;* Making a generous contribution to ACM's sponsorship of &quot;The InformationAge&quot; with our next membership renewalandM;* Becoming a member of the Computer MuseumandM;* Devising questions for the next Computer BowlandM;* Letting the Museum know about historically significant hardware, softwareand documentation before discarding itandM;For more information on the Computer Museum and its programs contact: OliverStrimpel, Curator The Computer Museum 300 Congress Street Boston, MA 02210</TEXT></DOC>
