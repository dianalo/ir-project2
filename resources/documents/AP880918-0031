But his mind, of late, has been back inWashington, reliving past battles on the Potomac.   What he remembers isn't at all flattering to those who servedwith him, and what he sees for the future isn't always reassuring.Barry Goldwater, as always, is still speaking bluntly.   At age 79, Goldwater has written another book, reflecting on his30-year career as a United States senator, his 1964 Republicanpresidential bid, and the people and events he encountered alongthe way. ``Goldwater,'' written with Jack Casserly, will bepublished by Doubleday on Oct. 12.   ``Nostalgia for the old days and other times rises like the sunmost of my mornings,'' Goldwater says. ``But in the evening, whenthe cool desert air refreshes my spirit, my blood flows faster andI shake my fist at the present.''   Considering his outspoken words, Goldwater must have writtenmost of his book in the evening, with his blood flowing. NeitherDemocrats nor Republicans are spared:   PRESIDENT REAGAN: ``I believe Reagan did know of the diversionof Iranian funds to the Contras. He had to know. The White Houseexplanation makes him out to be either a liar or incompetent.''   SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADER BOB DOLE: ``Dole doesn't have theleadership qualities that his job as minority leader requires. Hetries to make everybody happy. That can't be done. I and otherRepublicans were unable to harden his hide. The Kansas senator mustbecome tough if he is ever to become a leader.''   SENATE DEMOCRATIC LEADER ROBERT BYRD: ``One day I see Bob Byrdon the Senate floor and didn't recognize him. His face was coveredwith pancake makeup that ran down his starched collar. His hair wasstylishly fluffed. He looked like he was about to step on stage insome nightclub act. I took one look, walked back to my seat, satdown and waited for him to pull out his fiddle.''   PRESIDENT NIXON: ``Richard Nixon was the most dishonestindividual I have ever met in my life. He lied to his wife, hisfamily, his friends, his colleagues in the Congress, lifetimemembers of his own political party, the American people, and theworld.''   Election junkies will be disappointed if they expect similarobservations on the candidates in this year's presidentialelection. Fellow senators Lloyd Bentson and Dan Quayle, theDemocratic and Republican vice presidential nominees, are notdiscussed at all. The name George Bush appears one, fleeting time,Michael Dukakis not at all.   Goldwater, however, has something to say about the Democraticand Republican parties as they head into the November elections.   _DEMOCRATS are ``rethinking the fundamental meaning ofliberalism and simply have no new direction or programs to use inredirecting their energies.'' Looking beyond 1988, ``the Democratswill come back strong about the year 2000 or shortly thereafter.But it will be a new Democratic Party largely because of Reagan.''   _REPUBLICANS ``don't have to become more centrist, but it'scertain the GOP has to accommodate and balance a wider variety ofopinions and political options. We must become more a party ofinclusion.''   Referring to the New Right and its moral agenda, Goldwater said,``We began walking separate roads, however, when the New Rightbegan pushing special social agendas involving legitimate legal,religious and other differences. I support much of what they say,but not at the risk of compromising constitutional rights.''   Despite criticism of the Iran-Contra scandal and Reagan'schoices of Adm. John Poindexter as national security adviser andDonald Regan to be his White House chief of staff, Goldwater callsReagan ``the most inspirational president I have seen,'' edging outJohn F. Kennedy, who ``inspired the nation.''   Goldwater is less inspired by the growing federal andcongressional bureaucracies. ``The colossus we continue toconstruct in Washington is now being threatened from within,'' hesays. ``The large staffs created to help Congress are now beginningto control it. I've long asked the question: Who the hell isrunning Congress, we or the staffs?''   While Goldwater is optimistic that the world will solve problemsof population, hunger and disease, he says communism ``is theworld's greatest danger'' and ``the seeds of future global conflicthave unmistakably already been sown. A Third World War is notunthinkable.''   For 51 of his nearly 80 years, Barry Goldwater drew support fromhis wife, Peggy, who died in 1985, and he remembers her with painand poignancy in the book dedicated, simply, ``To Peggy.''   After her death, ``I phoned her four or five times every day formonths after returning to Washington. The phone would ring andring. Then her memory would fall away and my face would collapseinto my hands. The healing process has been slow and painful.''   If the title hadn't already been taken for a book about HarryTruman, Goldwater could have called his book ``Plain Speaking.'' Ashe says at the beginning, ``these recollections are straight fromthe shoulder _ a last salute before the flag is lowered and thefinal notes of taps fade into memory. A man stands up, says hispiece, then sits down. Others must judge his deeds.''</TEXT></DOC>
