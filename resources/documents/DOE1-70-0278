<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-70-0278 </DOCNO><TEXT>Recent biological testing [1] of sparked SF{sub 6} has yielded resultsthat implicate the existence of S{sub 2}F{sub 10} in the sparked gasand suggest that S{sub 2}F{sub 10} may play an important role in theover-all toxicity of sparked SF{sub 6}. Additionally, experiments onheated sparked SF{sub 6} and direct biological testing of S{sub 2}F{sub10} have strengthened the above claims. We report on the gas chromatographic(GC) analyses of sparked SF{sub 6} and the comparison with the analysesof 0.5% S{sub 2}F{sub 10}/SF{sub 6} mixtures. Under the GC conditionswhich were employed, a peak is observed at elution times identical (towithin 0.8%) to the S{sub 2}F{sub 10} peak in the S{sub 2}F{sub 10}/SF{sub6} samples. Measurements made on SO{sub 2}/SOF{sub 2}/SF{sub 6} mixturesindicate that SO{sub 2} elutes from the column at times extremely closeto but slightly longer than (by 10%) what we believe to be the S{sub2}F{sub 10} peak. Although complete confirmation of the identificationof S{sub 2}F{sub 10} in our sparked SF{sub 6} samples awaits furthermeasurements by mass spectrometry of the GC effluent, our conclusionbased on these analyses indicates that S{sub 2}F{sub 10} is formed inamounts (on the order of hundreds of ppM) consistent with concentrationsnecessary for producing the toxic effects which we have previously observed.13 refs., 3 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
