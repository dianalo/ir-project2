Some children missed entire school days because their busesnever picked them up. But Johnson said no one apparently missedschool Thursday because of bus problems.   Johnson said a new, tougher federal commercial drivers'licensing law caused ``tremendous difficulty'' for bus companies.``But they knew what our needs were going to be,'' he said.   ``There's no doubt that when contract renewal comes up, thosecompanies that have not performed satisfactorily will feel theeffects,'' Johnson said.   Mark Schmidt of the secretary of state's office said the buscompanies were able to recruit enough potential drivers but morethan usual failed the tests because of the tougher law.   Drivers were so sparse early this year that more buses thanusual had to make double runs, causing some students to miss theirfirst hour of school - and important classes often taught in themorning, like reading. Some children also had to wait longer thanusual for afternoon buses.   The delays were particularly hard on disabled pupils who mustreceive medicine and physical therapy on schedule, said Sue Stoll,assistant principal at Hanson Park School.</TEXT></DOC>
