(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nutri-System Inc. filed a lawsuit Tuesdayaccusing a former vice president of stealing a $30 million marketingplan when she went to work for a competitor, Weight WatchersInternational.   The suit asks Montgomery County Common Pleas Court to bar WeightWatchers from competing with Nutri-System, based in Willow Grove, inthe weight-loss market.   The suit also asks the court to order Weight Watchers, which isbased in Jericho, N.Y., to pay Nutri-System all profits derived fromthe information provided by Jean Bakken.   Bakken was promoted to the new position of vice president forcompetitive marketing on Aug. 18 and resigned Sept. 5 to work in asimilar position for Weight Watchers, according to the suit.   Weight Watchers also tried to lure other Nutri-System managementpersonnel, the suit says.   At Nutri-System, Bakken was working on an 18-month marketing planand participated in meetings with Don McCulloch and Al DiMarco,senior officers and owners of the company, involving confidentialinformtion, the suit says.   When company officials searched Bakken's office after herresignation, they found that ``virtually all of the company'sdocuments, including confidential and proprietary materialspreviously supplied to or requested by Bakken, were missing,''according to the suit.   The company charges that ``she is unlawfully using or unlawfullyintends to use such information for the benefit of Weight Watchers.''   The suit, saying Bakken abused the confidential nature of herrelationship with Nutri-System, asks the court to bar her fromworking for Weight Watchers.   No one answered the phone Tuesday afternoon at the Pittsburghoffices of H.J. Heinz Co., the parent company of Weight Watchers. Aphone number for Bakken could not be located.   ``When a $5.2 billion company like Heinz obtains valuable,proprietary information from a $433 million company, it is not onlyunlawful and unethical, but could also cause Nutri-Systemirreparable harm,'' McCulloch said in a news release.</TEXT></DOC>
