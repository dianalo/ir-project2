A means for convertingthe various organic resources to fuel is gasification. The feedstockfor gasification includes carbide, heavy distillate, methanol, oil shaleand biomass. Coal gasification will be described elsewhere. The productionof natural gas in Japan in 1986 was 2,105 million m{sup 3} showing a5.4% decrease from that in the previous year. The sales amount of gasin 1986 was 12.3 billion m{sup 3} showing the rate of growth of 6.2%to that in the previous year. The consumption of ammonia in 1985 wentdown to 1.9 million tons showing a 8.6% decrease from that in the previousyear. Although the supply of imported LPG was stable in 1986, the priceof it fluctuated violently in this year. (16 tabs, 118 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
