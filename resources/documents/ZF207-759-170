(technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Seraji, Homayoun.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>A simple and computationally efficient solution is developed forthe control of the configuration of redundant manipulators.andO;'Redundancy', when a robot arm has more degrees of freedom (DOF)than necessary for a specific task, enables the position of therobot arm to be reconfigured without moving the hand (endmanipulator) position.andP;  The new method enables end-effectortrajectory tracking directly in Cartesian space, while alsoeffecting additional kinematic constraints on the balance of thearm to resolve any potential variations due to redundancy and toachieve any additional tasks.andP;  Controller gains are updatedcontinuously and simple to compensate for changing manipulatordynamics.andP;  Details of the development and experimentalimplementation of the control scheme are described.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Robot ArmsManipulatorsControl TheoryControl SystemsSystem DesignMethods.andO;Feature:   illustrationchart.andO;Caption:   Self-motion of planar 3-DOF arm.
