Just ask one of the leading lights of the environmental movement -- the National Wildlife Federation.    The retired Virginia doctor is suing to keep 357 acres of Virginia land he donated to the federation for use as a bird sanctuary. The National Wildlife Federation is turning it into a housing development. Dr. Moore says the federation has become a bureaucracy that is more interested in pursuing a political agenda than preserving nature.    In 1975, Dr. Moore, the honorary president of the Wildlife Federation, donated some land near Washington, D.C., to the group for use as a conservation center. He received a letter from the federation's board explicitly restricting the preserve's use in perpetuity. Since then it has served as a home for 185 species of birds and been called &quot;a gem of a wildlife area&quot; by a Smithsonian guidebook.    But like many environmental groups, the federation began to change in the 1980s as highly paid careerists replaced the old leadership and the focus shifted from conservation to lobbying. The group's annual budget is now $63 million and it has 17 staff lawyers. A new seven-story, $40 million office building is going up in downtown Washington. In 1986, the federation sold the Moore sanctuary for $8.5 million to a developer who plans to put up 1,350 housing units. Only 53 acres, the minimum required by law, would remain open space.    &quot;They broke a contract in order to pay for an office building,&quot; Dr. Moore says. &quot;The board thought I'd be dead or crazy by now. Well, I'm not.&quot; He has filed a lawsuit demanding that the federation reverse the sale or build a new nature preserve elsewhere.    Federation officials insist the Moore land wasn't &quot;good wildlife habitat&quot; and that the proceeds from the sale will go to an endangered-species program. Furthermore, they claim the preserve duplicates a nearby federation center even though more than half of its 40 acres are covered with buildings and parking lots.    To Dr. Moore the federation's new leaders are a bureaucracy that has made a practice of selling donated land when benefactors thought it would be preserved. A former federation staffer told Outside magazine that &quot;proceeds from the Moore sale are simply going to pay for more lobbying.&quot;    Indeed, Claude Moore's farm isn't the only land the Wildlife Federation has unloaded for cash in recent years. Writer Alston Chase reported in Outside that the federation's entire Land Heritage Program has been terminated. &quot;We discontinued it because we found it was a poor way to raise money,&quot; says Charles Miller, NWF director of media relations. Lava Lakes, a 2,700-acre bird sanctuary in northern California, was sold to a rancher last year. The federation also asked an Indiana court to remove deed restrictions from some Maryland land that had been willed to the federation on the firm condition that it become a wildlife refuge. The court removed the covenant, though the federation no longer contemplates selling to private interests.    Certainly there's nothing inherently wrong with environmental groups treating land as a capital asset. Some have used such income to finance other environmental programs. The Audubon Society derives valuable income from permitting oil drilling in a Louisiana wildlife preserve it owns. But the federation and other groups are less and less interested in conservation and increasingly committed to lobbying Uncle Sam to spend money on programs the groups either used to do themselves or on issues that never were part of their charters.    Ray Arnett, a former Wildlife Federation president, says he &quot;fully supports what Moore is doing&quot; and is &quot;shocked&quot; at the federation's actions. &quot;NWF was known as the largest conservation education association in the world. Now they have moved more to advocacy, lobbying.&quot; Federation brochures, for example, now advocate population control as a means of ensuring more land for wildlife.    The Wildlife Federation has finally cut away the moralistic shrubbery to reveal what many critics have long tried to point out about the extreme wing of the environmental movement -- namely, that it is exploiting environmentalism's instinctively attractive goals to underwrite an explicitly political agenda. We sympathize with Dr. Moore and Ray Arnett in their bitterness at this betrayal. We just wonder why it has taken this long for the scales to fall from their eyes.    Regardless of the outcome of his lawsuit, Dr. Moore is optimistic. Local officials have declared their intention to buy the sanctuary for a public park. &quot;But that still won't put the federation back on the right track,&quot; he says. &quot;Somebody else is going to have to do that.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
