A magistrate previously ruled thatBatinic violated the conditions of his release after chemical tests showedthat he used methamphetamine and cocaine in 1988.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SECRETS-THEFT PLOTTER TO SERVE SIX MONTHSIN HALFWAY HOUSE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Batinic was one of four men indicted four years ago in a highly publicizedcase of international intrigue. One defendant, exporter Charles McVey, isstill fighting extradition from Canada. The others -- Batinic's brother,Stevan, and programming whiz Kevin Anderson -- have been convicted andsentenced.;    The case centered on a plot to steal powerful computertechnology from the now-defunct Saxpy Computer Corp. of Sunnyvale, where IvanBatinic worked. The two brothers and Anderson carried some computer disks intoCanada, where they were to meet McVey. But federal investigators broke up thering before any technology could be transferred to the Soviets.;    IvanBatinic pleaded guilty last fall to one count of conspiring to exportcontrolled technical data to the Soviet Union and one count of conspiring totransport stolen property across state lines.;    When the four were arrestedin 1987, authorities described the conspiracy as a potential threat tonational security because the stolen material included designs for asupercomputer that could be used in anti-submarine or anti-missile warfare.;   Officials have since acknowledged that the designs were for a powerfulmicroprocessor, not a supercomputer. During a hearing last week, AssistantU.S. Attorney Leland Altschuler said the device was not classified as militaryequipment. But he argued that it could be used for anti-submarine warfare andthat such an application would be classified as secret.;    Batinic hasmaintained that he developed second thoughts about the conspiracy even beforehe was caught. In a tearful statement to Judge William Ingram last week,Batinic said he held back some critical information and deceived hisco-conspirators to minimize the damage.;    Altschuler disputed that claim,citing experts who testified that Batinic had stolen enough information toenable the Soviets to reconstruct the entire device.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BRANDON BAILEY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910315  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  391  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday March 15, 199100075236,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
