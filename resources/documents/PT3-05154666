The system comprises a plurality of main      distribution ducts each adapted to be located in the space defined between      the finished ceiling of a lower story and the finished floor of an upper      story lying immediately above the lower story. The main ducts are located      on alternate floors and adapted to supply sufficient air for the two      adjacent floors. Each of the main ducts are provided with at least one      upper duct which communicates with an upper story through the base floor      and at least one lower duct which communicates with a lower story through      the rough ceiling thereof. A variable air volume control unit is connected      to each upper and lower duct controlling the volume of conditioned air      entering a story of the building in order to control the temperature      within the user space therein. A fire separator element is provided in the      variable air volume control for the upper story to close the variable air      volume valve to prevent fire, smoke and debris in one floor from entering      an adjacent floor. </PAL></ABST><PARN> <PAR>  This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 07/583,908, filed Sep. 17,      1990, now abandoned. </PAR></PARN><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to an air exchange system for use in      multi-story buildings which, in particular, reduces the average floor to      floor height required in multi-story buildings. </PAR><PAR>  A typical steel frame multi-story office or residential or mixed use)      building is built with a 12'6&quot; to 13' floor to floor height. This allows      for an 8'6&quot; to 9' ceiling height measured from ceiling to finished floor      (not the top of the access floor.) Approximately 4' is reserved for      ceiling space and included therein, for example, are concrete/metal decks,      steel framing, fireproofing, air distribution systems, lighting, sprinkler      systems, and other ceiling construction. A large portion of this 4' space      is needed for accommodating the air distribution system for air      conditioning and/or heating the occupied space. </PAR><PAR>  In addition to the ceiling space required between floors, many office      buildings that are built today also require access flooring to be built      throughout the occupied space in order to facilitate the installation and      replacement of wiring which is required to operate and interact with      computers, telephones, communication systems, typewriters, etc. A typical      access floor for normal office use is 6&quot;. Many special applications such      as computer rooms, trading floors, etc. require floors as high as 24&quot;. </PAR><PAR>  When a 6&quot; access flooring is included as a tenant amenity, the available      ceiling height decreases to approximately 8' to 8'6&quot;. In order to achieve      a 8'6&quot; ceiling with a raised floor and a 12'6&quot; floor to floor height, more      design and construction effort is required to make the ceiling less deep.      Consequently, the construction is more costly due to the increase in      materials, such as increased curtainwall, increased material for longer      elevator travel and more structural steel. The curtainwall, for example,      of a new building could be as high as $75.00/sq. ft. or $38.00 a foot of      perimeter per floor of building to raise the floor-to-floor height by 6&quot;. </PAR><PAR>  In a typical 50 story office building, this cost would normally fall in the      range of $1,500,000 or approximately $1.00/sq.ft. of floor area. In      addition to the increased cost, many zoning laws restrict building height      such that if the floor to floor height is increased the developer will      lose available floor area. </PAR><PAR>  In one attempted solution to this problem, an access floor manufacturer has      developed a system which distributes air under the floor. In this system,      air is pumped under low pressure under the floor using a typical air      conditioning ducts. The air in the ducts enters the office areas through      grilles cut in the access floor. These grilles are spaced according to the      tenant's individual space plan. Since the air is under low pressure, a fan      located in the grill is used to suck the air out of the floor space and      into the office space. The fan is thermostatically controlled to control      the space temperature. The air conditioning unit is located within the      core of the building near the elevators. Air from the unit must then cross      under the corridors usually placed around the core by space planners.      However, the corridor area is also used to run the wiring systems and is      therefore most likely to require service. Servicing this area requires      removal of the panels located along the floor and usually near the source      of the incoming air. Removal of the panels causes the remaining floor to      be deprived of air conditioning or heating for extended periods of time.      Furthermore, improper replacement of the panels will result in an air      leak. For these reasons, this system has had limited success. </PAR><PAR>  As noted by the foregoing, the prior art has failed to provide an air      conditioning and distributing system for use in a multi-story building      which minimizes the floor to floor height needed to construct the building      while providing available ceiling height of at least 8', for example, in      the occupied user space. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an air      conditioning and distribution system for use in a multi-story building      which minimizes the average floor to floor height needed to construct a      building while providing available ceiling height of 8' or more, for      example, in the occupied space. </PAR><PAR>  According to one form of the present invention, an air exchange system is      provided for a building having a plurality of stories each having a base      floor, finished floor, finished ceiling and rough ceiling, thereby      defining user space between the finished floor and finished ceiling. The      air exchange system comprises a plurality of air distribution duct means      each located between the finished ceiling of one lower story and the      finished floor of another upper story lying immediately above the one      lower story. The air distribution means are located on alternate floors      and adapted to supply sufficient conditioned air for the user space in two      adjacent floors. Each of the air distribution duct means comprises means      for delivering conditioned air into the one lower story through the      finished ceiling and another upper story through the finished floor. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a side cross-sectional view of an air exchange system according      to the present invention located between two adjacent floors; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a side view showing, in closer detail, a variable air volume      control including a fire separator device which can be used in the air      exchange system according to the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3A is a top plan view of a room divider partition for use in an upper      story for delivering and distributing conditioned air; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3B is a side elevational view of the room divider partition o FIG. 3A;      and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3C is a side elevational view in cross-section, of the partition and      cap base of the partition. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the      drawings. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown a cross sectional view of the air      exchange system 10 according to the present invention. The system includes      a generally horizontal main distribution duct 12 through which conditioned      air is brought to the floors. Conditioned air may be supplied to the main      distribution duct 12 by an air exchange unit (not shown) through the      building core (not shown). An upper duct 14 and a lower duct 16 are tapped      off and in communication with the main distribution duct 12. </PAR><PAR>  The upper duct 14 passes through an opening in the cement deck 22 and the      access flooring 24 located below the upper story office space 26 so that      conditioned air can enter the office space 26 of the upper story through a      floor grill 28 in finished floor 24. Likewise, conditioned air from the      main distribution duct 12 can enter the lower story office space 32 of the      lower adjacent floor by passing through the lower duct 16 and the ceiling      grill 34. The floor grill 28 and ceiling grill 34 can, of course, be      located elsewhere, such as on the walls of the respective office spaces.      If distribution grill 28 is located on a wall of adjacent space, the      configuration may be that shown in FIG. 3 to be described below. </PAR><PAR>  The upper and lower ducts 14 and 18 include variable air volume controls 36      and 38, respectively, to control the temperature in the office spaces 26      and 32. The variable air volume controls 36 and 38 are controlled by      thermostats 40 and 42, respectively. </PAR><PAR>  In the preferred embodiment, the main distribution duct is built larger      than a conventionally sized duct for a single floor in order to supply      sufficient air to two adjacent floors. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 1, the access floor 44 located below the office space 32      is not as high above its respective base floor (not shown) as the access      floor 24 is above base floor 22 because it need not contain any ducts for      air distribution. Similarly, the access ceiling space 46 above office      space 26 between finished ceiling 48 and rough ceiling 50 need not be as      high as the access ceiling space 52 because it need not contain any main      ducts for air distribution. However, ducts may be provided in access      ceiling space 46 for collecting return air, as shown. The distance between      the finished ceiling upward to the finished floor for the alternate floors      which do not contain the air ducts can be much less than the distance      between the finished ceiling upward to the finished floor for the other      alternate floors which do contain the main air and other ducts. The      overall average floor-to-floor height of a multi-story building can      thereby be significantly reduced, because air conditioning units need be      located only on alternate floors. </PAR><PAR>  Turning now to FIG. 2, the variable air volume control 36 will be described      in greater detail. The variable air volume control 36 comprises a valve      box 60, which defines, in its upper region, a valve seat 62, annular in      configuration. Valve piston member 64, having a frusto-conical shape, is      configured and sized to fit snugly in valve seat 62 to thereby close the      valve. A shaft 66 is mounted at its upper end to the underside of valve      piston member 64, and at its lower end to pneumatic motor 68. Motor 68 is      connected to and responsive to the thermostat 40 located in the upper      story user space 26. Depending on the sensed temperature, the motor 68      will raise or lower valve piston member 64 to thereby control the volume      of conditioned air delivered to the user space 26. A fusible heat      responsive link 70 is provided in shaft 66, which melts in response to an      abnormal level of heat indicating a fire or the like, to thereby      disconnect the shaft 66 from motor 58 and allow the piston member 64 to      drop into valve seat 62 by force of gravity and thereby serve as a fire      separator element. A similar arrangement can be provided for the variable      air volume control 38, except for the fusible link 70. </PAR><PAR>  The valve seat 62, valve piston member 64 and shaft 66 are of course made      of non-combustible and fire proof or fire resistant material. </PAR><PAR>  The variable air volume control 34, particularly the annular seat 62      portion, fits into an opening in the base floor 22 which is annular in      shape. The annular opening in the base floor 22 can be achieved by either      locating preset inserts 79 in the slab at predetermined locations either      in a grid or according to a space plan before the cement floor is poured,      or by cutting holes in the floor 22 after the cement is poured. </PAR><PAR>  A partition arrangement for distributing conditioned air in an upper story      is shown in FIGS. 3A, 3B and 3C. The partition 80 comprises two walls 82      and 84 which are about 3'0 to 7' in height and intersect about midway      along their length to divide part of the user space into four quadrants.      The partitions can define quadrants for a four person work station in an      office space environment. The walls of the partition can be partially or      totally hollow and the hollow portion communicates at its lower end with      duct 14. A top cap 90 is provided which covers the entire partition      structure and defines therein a horizontal channel in communication with      the hollow portion. Perforations are formed along the underside of the top      cap 90, as shown in FIG. 3C, to provide conditioned air to the four      quadrant areas. </PAR><PAR>  In the preferred embodiment, the air exchange system is used to provide      cool conditioned air for an office building. However, the disclosed and      other particular embodiments can be constructed and used for providing      heated air. </PAR><PAR>  While the preferred embodiment has been described in conjunction with an      office building, it of course may be used for a residential or mixed use      multi-story building. </PAR><PAR>  It has now been shown that conditioned air is provided and distributed to      the floors of an office building in a less expensive and more efficient      manner than provided in the prior art. </PAR><PAR>  While one preferred embodiment of the present invention has been shown and      described, it will be apparent that many modifications and variations      could be effected by one skilled in the art without departing from the      spirit or scope of the novel concept of the invention, which should be      determined by the appended claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
