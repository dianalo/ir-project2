Northrop, plagued by more troubled programs than most defense contractors of its size, will instead issue intermediateterm notes in a private placement managed by First Boston Corp. Northrop disclosed its intention to make the private placement in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing, but it didn't give a reason.    In the past year and a half, the company's total debt outstanding virtually -- all of it on a short-term, floating-rate basis -- has climbed 62%. Since early this year, Northrop executives have been talking with investment banking firms about converting part of the $905 million in bank debt to fixed-rate notes, which would be less vulnerable to a rise in interest rates. Kent Kresa, Northrop president, announced the debt-conversion plan several months ago in a speech to Wall Street investment analysts.    But plans to go to the public markets bogged down last month, after a grand jury began investigating whether Northrop and its chairman, Thomas V. Jones, violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in making about $7.8 million in payments to entities controlled by an individual close to high officials in the South Korean government. The executive committee of Northrop's board also has been looking into the payments made in 1984 and 1986, which Northrop officials claim were intended to build a hotel in Seoul. The hotel, however, was never built.    &quot;They decided to go private based on what they believed would be a difficulty in getting their registration statement (for public debt) through&quot; the Securities and Exchange Commission, said an investment banker who participated in meetings with Northrop officials on the subject. The investment banker said Northrop executives told him the company's statement could be held up for several months if the SEC decided to review the South Korean matter.    Individuals in the investment banking community who linked the grand jury inquiry to Northrop's decision to seek financing through a private placement &quot;certainly didn't get that from me,&quot; said John C. Campbell, the company's chief financial officer.    Securities placed privately -- often to insurance companies, other institutions and wealthy individuals -- are exempt from registration with the SEC and aren't quoted on public exchanges. They are attractive to investors because they offer higher yields than conventional bonds, but they also carry higher risks and market illiquidity.    Northrop expects to complete the private placement, which is expected to include three-year, five-year and seven-year notes, by the middle of next month, Mr. Campbell said in a telephone interview. The company's remaining debt would be financed through commercial paper and existing bank short-term credit lines, he added.    It will cost Northrop &quot;slightly&quot; more to issue its debt privately than publicly but the cost would be offset by the speed of the private transaction, Mr. Campbell said. &quot;It will take less time than if we file a registration statement on the shelf and then have to activate it.&quot; He estimated the higher cost at about 10 basis points, or one-tenth of 1% of the debt issue's value.    He added that the company's large number of classified military programs would make it difficult &quot;to communicate what the future of your company looks like&quot; in an offering circular that would accompany a public offering. He also cited Northrop's lack of &quot;name recognition&quot; with public investors as an argument against the public offering. He acknowledged, however, that &quot;we're not known in the private placement market either.&quot;    However, investment bankers familiar with Northrop's deliberations said company executives were concerned about negative publicity surrounding the Korean investigation occurring on top of other problems at the company. A negative image with the investment public would be especially troublesome for Northrop, which hasn't raised debt in the public markets in about 20 years.    &quot;If the underwriters said, you have something coming up that may affect the fortunes of the company or make it look a little seedy at the moment, Northrop was wise to avoid the public markets. The public markets are wary of that sort of thing,&quot; said Joseph Bartlett, an attorney with the New York law firm, Gaston andamp; Snow, which specializes in private placements.    Executives in the corporate finance department at First Boston couldn't be reached for comment.    Negative publicity about problems at Northrop has mounted since frustrated employees in 1986 appeared in congressional hearings to level charges that the company's production of guidance systems for MX nuclear-tipped missiles was shoddy.    In June, a Northrop division was searched as part of the continuing massive probe of influence-peddling on government contracts, and the company's $46 billion B2 Stealth bomber program is rumored to be way over budget and could be vulnerable to budget cuts in a new presidential administration. The Stealth program and two missile programs are the subject of civil suits brought by current and former employees, and the Justice Department's criminal division is looking into possible fraud in related areas.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Northrop closed unchanged at $29.625 a share.
