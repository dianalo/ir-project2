U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Charles Matheson late Wednesday issued acourt order approving the sale to Maxtor Corp. of San Jose, Calif.,following his receipt of Maxtor's outline of the financial andmanagement details for MiniScribe.   Richard Rifenburgh, president of the Longmont, Colo.-basedMiniScribe, said Maxtor's operations provided the best complementto MiniScribe of all the companies that expressed interest.   ``It's the best possible situation for MiniScribe employees,''he said.   Maxtor's bid to buy the firm included a commitment to retainMiniScribe's operations in Longmont, which was one reason itsproposal was favored over an estimated $51 million bid from WearnesTechnology Ltd., which is based in Singapore.   MiniScribe filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S.Bankruptcy Code Jan. 1 after failing to settle numerous lawsuitsthat alleged the company's past management committed fraud. Itsdebts total about $110 million.   Last month, company officials told Matheson they were runningout of money to keep plants operating and asked for the stepped-upcourt-ordered auction.   Attorneys worked through the night on negotiations with Maxtor,Wearnes and Standard Chartered Bank of Hong Kong, MiniScribe's leadlender.   Before a courtroom packed with more than two dozen MiniScribeemployees and numerous lawyers, attorney Patrick A. Murphy detailedMaxtor's original $40 million bid, consisting of $20 million incash and $20 million in common stock.   The proposal covers substantially all of the assets ofMiniScribe, including its subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Singapore.Maxtor also planned to send managers to Longmont's MiniScribe'soffice and put up $30 million in working capital between now andthe proposed closing date July 1.   But Murphy asked for a recess after hearing the terms ofWearnes' bid, which included $46.5 million in cash, plus about $4.5million in accounts receivable and cash in the two Far Eastsubsidiaries. Wearnes' proposed a closing date in May.   Maxtor returned with a $41.5 million offer, plus the accountsreceivables and cash in the Far East subsidiaries.   Gerald Munitz, attorney for Standard Chartered Bank, said thecreditor supported Maxtor's bid because there was a greatercertainty for employment in the Longmont area.   George Scalise, Maxtor's president and chief executive officer,said the proposal was based on the premise that MiniScribe wouldremain open for business.   No decision has been made yet on whether there would be layoffsat the firm, or whether Maxtor would change MiniScribe's name, hesaid. In the interim, MiniScribe would be operated as a subsidiary.   ``For the most part, it will remain a stand-alone operation,''he said. ``This is such a tough task to take on. If the doors hadbeen closed, we would have had to reassess it.''   Attorney Glen Keller said MiniScribe received at least 111inquiries from companies interested in purchasing the disk drivemanufacturer.   Commenting on the unusual court-ordered auction process,Matheson said he approved the step because it was clear thatMiniScribe would not have been able to continue operations withoutan infusion of cash.   Richard Yen, president of Wearnes' operations in the UnitedStates, said he was disappointed with the outcome, but wouldn'tchallenge the court's decision.</TEXT></DOC>
