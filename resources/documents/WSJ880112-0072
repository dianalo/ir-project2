Yang (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> CNG EXE </G><DATELINE> DES MOINES, Iowa  </DATELINE><TEXT>   As the campaign for the Iowa caucuses enters the final phase, the presidential candidates' television commercials reflect the nature of the battles in the two parties.    Playing both to national concerns and the Farm Belt's particular worries, the Democrats are emphasizing the economy. Some paint a hopeful picture of the nation's future if they are elected, while others are warning of the dangers if they aren't. &quot;The Democrats are trying to grab hold of an issue they think they can win on,&quot; says Robert Squier, a Democratic media consultant who isn't working for any of the presidential candidates this year.    The leading Republicans, on the other hand, are playing down issues and playing up themselves. In previous ads, Vice President George Bush -- who isn't on the air with commercials right now -- has stressed his lengthy resume of government service. Sen. Robert Dole plays on the cultural divide between himself and the vice president. The GOP also-runs, meanwhile, are looking for any way they can to take shots at the two leaders.    &quot;The difference is in the nature of the races,&quot; says Mr. Squier. &quot;The Republicans have natural front-runners.&quot;    Even in a state like Iowa, which puts a premium on &quot;retail,&quot; in-person politicking, television is the name of the game. On a good day, a candidate might hope to be seen in the flesh by several hundred, maybe even a thousand voters. But more than 100,000 are expected to participate in each party's caucuses next month, making TV commercials essential in acquainting voters with the candidate and conveying his message.    Commercials can also, of course, be a vehicle for questionable charges. That is going on here too.    Democrats are focusing on the future in their ads largely because the party's recent past is something they'd like to forget: the Carter administration, the landslide defeat of Walter Mondale four years ago and President Reagan's firm grasp on the national political agenda for much of his two terms.    Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon take the positive approach, painting a bright picture of where they want to lead the country. Their TV spots seek to evoke a confident mood with broad platitudes rather than specific policy positions. So viewers see smiling children at play and hear Gov. Dukakis declaring, &quot;We have a golden moment to define that dream that our children will call America.&quot; And Sen. Simon, seated in a homey living room, talks of restoring &quot;values and priorities&quot; to the federal government.    Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt takes the opposite tack, darkly warning of the consequences of losing family farms or losing manufacturing jobs to overseas competitors. His commercials try to rally viewers into action, ending with the slogan: &quot;It's your fight, too.&quot;    The approach a candidate chooses says less about the way he views the world than it does about what he and his advisers think will spur Iowans to go to caucuses on the night of Feb. 8 -- &quot;what he thinks can really get people going,&quot; says Michael Hawthorne, a political scientist at Iowa's Grinnell College.    Sen. Dole hopes to score by appealing to a shared cultural identity with his audience. His commercial chronicles his Depression-era roots in nearby Kansas and his recovery from wounds suffered in World War II. The commercial begins with an announcer asking, &quot;What's the difference&quot; among the GOP rivals and ends with the answer: &quot;Only one is one of us.&quot; The obvious, but unspoken, comparison is with Mr. Bush's patrician New England upbringing.    Scripts are being prepared for new Bush commericals, which are expected to be on the air in Iowa soon, continuing the themes of experience and leadership he has used previously.    The other GOP candidates have basically declared open season on those two. Rep. Jack Kemp is the boldest: A commercial that began running last week assails Messrs. Bush and Dole for opposing his 1980 tax-cut proposals in a way that implies that they opposed the 1981 tax cut that was the keystone of Mr. Reagan's economics plan. The ad doesn't mention that by 1981 Mr. Bush was a fervent supporter of Mr. Reagan's program, that the tax-cutting legislation was produced by the Senate Finance Committee when Mr. Dole was its chairman, and that Mr. Dole voted for the bill.    Meanwhile, Gov. Dukakis, in his spots, leaves the impression that the federal budget deficit-reduction plan enacted last month cuts Medicare benefits for the elderly and disabled. In fact, physicians, hospitals and other Medicare providers bear the brunt of the program's $2.1 billion cut.    Because many of the Democratic candidates are relatively unknown on the national scene, they hope their commercials will provide a personal introduction to the state's voters. But former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, who has had his problems with the medium, is barely visible in a new ad, which quotes recent favorable newspaper and magazine articles. His only appearance in the ad: a postage-stamp-size still photograph that appears momentarily at the end screen. </TEXT></DOC>
