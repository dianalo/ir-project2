<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-34-0435 </DOCNO><TEXT>The process of two-electron capture has been studied for the collisionsystems Ar/sup +5/+D{sub 2} at 500 and 1000 eV (v = 0.022 and 0.032 a.u.).The total laboratory energies of the deuterons emitted in the Coulombexplosion of the target following double capture were measured in coincidencewith the charge-changed projectiles detected at selected scattering angles.Using a computer simulation of the kinematics of these reactions, wewere able to deduce the effective two-electron binding energies for D{sub2} as a function of collision energy. The results indicate that at theselow energies the Franck-Condon principle is not applicable.</TEXT></DOC>
