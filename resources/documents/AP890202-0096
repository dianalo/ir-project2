Egypt, meanwhile, would get 150 Hawk missiles and Israel 200shoulder-fired Stingers, while Jordan again would receive noAmerican weapons this year, said the sources, who spoke on conditionof anonymity.   The potential Arab purchases could touch off another row withIsrael's supporters in Congress, who were successful during theCarter and Reagan administrations in blocking U.S. sales that wereconsidered threating to the Jewish state.   But the skilfull management of James A. Baker III, then the WhiteHouse chief of staff and now secretary of state, and other Reaganadministration operatives overcame stubborn resistance to the saleof Awacs radar planes to Saudi Arabia which the Senate approved52-48.   The Abrams tank is considered the best in the world. Recently,U.S. and Egyptian officials completed arrangements for co-productionin Egypt with the aim of providing the Egyptian army with them.   The weapons list sent to Congress last Thursday is classified.Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House Foreign Affairssubcommittee that deals with the Middle East, is understood to havecautioned other members of Congress and staff aides not to leak anyof the items.   Meanwhile, the White House, in a cover letter, informed Congressthe Saudis were in the process of deciding whether to request U.S.or European fighter planes to replace their F-5s in the next decade,the sources said.   The letter said the Saudis were considering jet fighters to bejointly produced by Britain and West Germany and the French Mirage4000, as well as U.S.-built F-16s and F-18s.   On the list for the Saudis were seven multiple-launch artilleryrocket systems, for battlefield use, and seven of the box-typerockets for Kuwait along with 1,500 Tow anti-tank missiles.   Egypt was listed to receive 150 Hawk anti-aircraft missiles andIsrael four helicopters along with the Stinger missiles.
