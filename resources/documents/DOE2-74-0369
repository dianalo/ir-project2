<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-74-0369 </DOCNO><TEXT>High resolution electronic spectroscopy is demonstrated in the study ofthe electronic structure of para-alkyl substituted phenols (p-cresol,p-ethylphenol, p-isopropylphenol, p-propylphenol, p-sec-butylphenol,p-tert-butylphenol, and p-pentylphenol) and 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl cyclobutane-1,3-dione(TMCBD). The study on p-alkyl substituted phenols performed by laserinduced fluorescence in a supersonic jet provided rich information ofthe electronic and vibrational structures of p-alkyl substituted phenolsin the excited state as well as in the ground state. This study alsoprovided a convenient method for the identification of conformationalisomers of molecules in the excited state by observing fluorescence excitationspectra of the molecules to be studied. The study of TMCBD performedby fluorescence and low temperature polarized absorption spectroscopiesprovided an alternative technique for the study of electronic structuresof molecules which cannot be studied in the gas phase under high resolutionconditions due to the low fluorescence quantum yields or low vapor pressuresof the molecules to be studied. Additionally, a complete vibrationalanalysis in the excited state (S{sub 1}) as well as in the ground statewas performed. 43 refs., 16 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
