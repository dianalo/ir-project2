Furthermore, oil requiresless specialized infrastructure and lower investment costs than gas,in order to be used by the final consumer. These issues, combined withthe somewhat slow response of the countries of the region to the highoil prices of the 70's, in terms of conservation and alternate energysources, have resulted in that most of South America's gas reserves,as well as in the other developing areas of the world, have been discoveredas a by-product of oil exploration. In spite of the above, the main consumingnations of South America are currently determined to develop their naturalgas local markets, regardless of crude oil price fluctuations, as partof their strategy in energy consumption. Meanwhile, countries of thearea with very limited oil-gas resources are forced to satisfy a greatpart of their energy needs with imported oil.</TEXT></DOC>
