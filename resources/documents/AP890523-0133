But a lawyer for an Alabama gun shop owner argued that thegovernment had already issued permits and should release 1,250semiautomatic rifles that were impounded at the Birmingham, Ala.,airport by the U.S. Customs Service.   The three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,based in Atlanta, sat in Miami for an expedited hearing on whetherto release the rifles to Don Wood, owner of Gun South Inc. inTrussville, Ala. The judges took the case under advisement afterthe one-hour session.   On April 26, U.S. District Judge William Acker Jr. had ruledthat Wood was entitled to delivery of Steyr AUG-SA Austrian-maderifles, which sell for $900 to $1,000 each.   But the government appealed the decision, and Stern arguedMonday that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms needs moretime to re-examine the permits it gave Gun South and other armsimporters.   The court's decision could affect the fate of about 640,000similar weapons already held up this year by the presidential baninstituted after a man with an assault rifle killed five childrenat a school in Stockton, Calif.   Wood's attorney, James C. Barton, dismissed the confiscation ofhis client's rifles as hysteria against a weapon already approvedby ATF as a sports rifle.   Stern ``has used the term `assault weapon' 95 times in the faceof testimony of his own experts,'' Barton said. ``This is a libelon my client's product, and we now have Congress using the sameterm in the Assault Weapon Control Act of 1989.''   Barton said the confiscation threatened his client's livelihoodand Gun South's 700 employees. The company has a total of 4,700imported semiautomatic rifles on order.</TEXT></DOC>
