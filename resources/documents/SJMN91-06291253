He knows I'm here if he needs me.&quot; Walsh works as an analyst for NBCSports.;   Young ran for two touchdowns, one of them a 7-yard dive into theend zone in the fourth quarter, and passed for two more. But his threeinterceptions -- two of them by former 49ers cornerback Tim McKyer -- cast apall on his 22-of-38, 348-yard passing performance.;   It was Walsh whoengineered the 1987 trade that brought Young to the 49ers from Tampa Bay, andhis support has never wavered.;   &quot;He's a favorite of mine,&quot; Walsh said. &quot;So Ireminded him that he was a gifted athlete, and that he played a great game. Itold him not to apologize for anything.&quot;; MORE HARRIS WOES: Green Bay Packersofficials knew about a drug investigation involving linebacker Tim Harrisbefore trading him to the 49ers on Sept. 29, a Green Bay, Wis., newspaperreported Wednesday.;   The investigation, which was reported to have begunshortly after Harris ran his boat aground in Green Bay in September 1990, wasdropped and involved no charges, Brown County Sheriff Leon Pieschek saidWednesday.;   The 49ers would not comment on the story.; JONES ON HOLD: Tightend Brent Jones, on injured reserve with torn knee ligaments, is eligible toreturn but hasn't practiced this week. &quot;It's a sore subject,&quot; Jones said. &quot;I'mout there running and catching the ball. I'm doing everything I'm supposed todo.&quot; Coach George Seifert said the earliest he expects Jones back is thePhiladelphia game Oct. 27 -- which would be on the unforgiving artificial turfat Veterans Stadium.; ETC.: Defensive end Kevin Fagan (right Achilles' tendon)is improving but is not expected to play this week against Detroit, Seifertsaid. . . . Strong safety Dave Waymer has recovered enough from his kneeinjury to possibly start again in the base defense. Johnnie Jackson startedlast week -- a token start, as the 49ers went into the nickel package afteronly one series. . . . Rookie cornerback Merton Hanks has been impressive, butfree-agent signee Mark Lee will remain the starter at left cornerback in thebase defense, Seifert said. Hanks will see action in the nickel package.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  NANCY GAY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911017  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  485  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, October 17, 199100291253,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
