The contract to work out the assets -- mostly bad realestate loans -- should bring an estimated $30 million in feesover the next five years to Banc One Management andamp; ConsultingCorp., a unit of Banc One, which is based in Columbus, Ohio.</LP><TEXT>   The choice of Banc One signals a change in FDIC policythat allows problem assets inherited by the agency to bemanaged by companies not involved in a bank's rescue.   Banc One Management, however, has long experience makingcollections for the FDIC. Its subsidiary, Bonnet ResourcesCorp., is about halfway through collecting FDIC-held assetsfrom MCorp., a 20-bank chain in Texas that failed in 1989.   Awarding of the contract, due to be publicly announcedthis morning, marks a final chapter of the New Hampshirebanking crisis, in which the state's five largest independentbanks collapsed. Last fall, the FDIC sold Dartmouth Bancorp,Numerica Financial Corp. and New Hampshire Savings Bank, withcombined assets of $2.19 billion, to an investor group thatnow runs them as a combined entity, New Dartmouth Bank. Theother two failed banks, Amoskeag Bank Shares Inc. andBankEast Corp., with combined assets of $1.8 billion, weresold by the FDIC to Bank of Ireland's First New HampshireBank unit.</TEXT></DOC>
