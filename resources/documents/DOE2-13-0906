(Japan).The reason for the cogeneration introduction lies in inhibition of increasein the contract electric power, preparation for increase in the steamdemand, and energy conservation. The gas turbine uses A heavy oil asa fuel, and generates a power of 1000 kW. The exhaust from the gas turbineof 500{sup 0}C in temperature is introduced in the waste heat boilerto produce steam of 3.3 tons/hrs. in max. flow rate and 7 kg/cm{sup 2}in pressure. The cogeneration started to be operated in 1985. The paralleloperation of the cogeneration with electric power utilities was not approvedby the office. Accordingly, the cogeneration was operated with the powergeneration system separated from commercial power sources. The contractpower could be reduced from 1400 kW to 700 kW. The generation unit andthe waste heat boiler were mounted outdoors to lower the temperatureof intake air. This served for prevention of the output from being reducedin summer. The operation of the cogeneration separated from electricutilities, having a limitation on the controlled power, is not efficient.Hourly-variations in the electric demand laid a large charge on the operators.For the purpose of improving these faults, the official approval to theparallel operation was obtained in January, 1988. the cogeneration couldbe ultimately operated by the automatic power control without instataneousinterruption at changing of the electric sources. The generation efficiencyof 18% and the waste heat recovery of 30% (target: 40%) were attained.The waste heat recovery should be further improved. (8 figs, 4 tabs,2 photos)</TEXT></DOC>
