JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Bush administration says it plans to cometo the rescue of the African elephant, whose numbers are beingthreatened by ivory hunters.   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan said Wednesday he has told U.S.representatives to an international conference next October to pushfor increased protection of the elephant.   The United States at the meeting will urge that the Africanelephant be placed in a more protected classification under theinternational endangered species treaty, thereby prohibiting any ofthe 101 treaty nations from engaging in the commercial trading ofivory.   The U.S. decision met immediate praise from several conservationand animal protection organizations which have for some time wantedthe United States to take a more direct interest in protecting theAfrican elephant.   ``The United States is by far the most influential member tocome out in favor of the proposal. This should carry a lot ofweight,'' said Priscilla Feral, president of Friends of Animals,which earlier this year petitioned the Interior Department to takeaction to protect the elephant.   Susan Lieberman, associate director of wildlife and environmentfor the Humane Society of America, said U.S. leadership in endingthe worldwide ivory trade ``is critical'' to protecting the Africanelephant.   ``No trinket is worth the death of an elephant and theextinction of a species,'' she said.   Since 1978, the number of African elephants found in 34countries has declined from 1.5 million to as few as 400,000,according to the government and private groups. The numbercontinues to decline at a rate of 8 percent a year, largely at thehands of ivory-seeking poachers, they say.   Last year the United States imported $32 million worth of ivory,most of which originated with the African elephant.   ``I am deeply concerned about the future of the Africanelephant,'' said Lujan in a statement announcing that thedepartment also is considering changing the African elephant'sclassification from ``threatened'' to ``endangered'' under the U.S.endangered species law. He told department officials to come upwith a recommendation.   Conservationists believe the action by the 101 nations thatbelong to the Convention on International Trade in EndangeredSpecies to place the African elephant on a more restrictive listwould severely cut into the international ivory trade.   Lujan said officials of the Fish and Wildlife Service will urgeaction by the 101 nations at the October meeting. A two-thirds voteis needed for the elephant to be reclassified.</TEXT></DOC>
