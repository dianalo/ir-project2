(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>EasyLinkandM;FACT FILE EasyLink Western Union Telegraph Corp., 1 Lake St., Upper SaddleRiver, NJ 07458; (201) 818-5000.andM;List Price: Minimum monthly charge, $25.andM;Per-Message Charges: First 500 characters, $.35; 501-1,000 characters, $.45;1,001-2,000 characters, $.60; each additional 1,000 characters, $.075.andM;Requires: Modem-equipped IBM-compatible computer with communicationssoftware.andM;In Short: EasyLink from Western Union offers a large subscriber base, avariety of delivery options, extensive database services, and new lowerprices.andP;  But the actual experience of creating, storing, or editing messageson-line can be frustrating for the average PC user.andM;Strictly on the basis of numbers, Western Union Telegraph Corp.'s EasyLinkprovides tough competition for MCI Mail and ATandamp;T Mail.andP;  EasyLink offers agreater number of delivery methods: in addition to electronic delivery, youcan opt for U.S.andP;  Mail service (2-day delivery), mailgram, telegram,cablegram, telex, and fax transmissions.andP;  Subscriber numbers are impressive,too--EasyLink surpasses MCI Mail's subscriber base with approximately 175,000active mailboxes.andP;  But the real news about EasyLink concerns the numbers thatappear on the bills.andM;In May of this year, Western Union announced a new pricing structure forbasic EasyLink service.andP;  Users will no longer be billed for time spenton-line, nor will they have to pay a surcharge for using high-speed phonelines.andP;  Like MCI Mail and ATandamp;T, EasyLink now bills according to the numberand length of the messages sent.andM;Under the old rate structure, our sample report and memo (see the chart&quot;Public E-Mail: Comparison of Costs&quot; in the sidebar &quot;Trimming The E-MailTab&quot;) would have cost $3.08 and $1.20 to transmit electronically.andP;  Providingyou are transmitting at 1,200 bits per second or faster (anyone transmittingat 300 bps will incur a surcharge), those figures drop to $2.23 and $.35,giving EasyLink the appearance of being the cheapest of the three servicesincluded in the survey.andM;Appearances can be deceiving, though: niggling holdovers from the old pricingstructure--like a $25 minimum monthly charge and surcharges for the use of800 numbers--add to the real-life cost of using EasyLink.andM;A new full-service offering does roll some additional functions into thebasic subscription price.andP;  You can now scan your mailbox, read mail, andcheck the status of outgoing messages without incurring any additionalcharges.andM;FACING FRUSTRATIONSandM;The EasyLink default on-line user interface is frustrating.andP;  Nonmnemonic orarbitrary commands like PTS (proceed to select), GA (go ahead), and LLLL(signalling the end of a message), make EasyLink anything but easy fornovices.andP;  Fortunately, you can bring up a menu system with common Englishterms like scan or read.andM;Except for the ability to write over a character (provided you are still onthe same line),  EasyLink offers no on-line editing.andP;  Worse, if you areon-line and don't wish to send a messge immediately, be prepared to lose yourdraft because EasyLink cannot store it on-line.andP;  The only workaround (otherthan creating messages off-line) is to send the message to yourself.andP;  Once itis delivered to you as mail, you can store it for 5 days.andM;EasyLink also requires that you know the addressee's exact mailbox number inorder to send a message.andP;  The on-line user directory doesn't do much tolessen this inconvenience.andP;  To look someone up in the database--which isaccessible only if you pay an additional annual $12 Fee--you must exit themail service.andP;  The database doesn't make it particularly easy to findindividuals because it is organized around company names and mailbox numbers.andM;One way to get around the &quot;no name&quot; addressing convention is to use theRediList feature.andP;  RediLists are mailing lists; they can be named and cancontain from 1 to 999 mailbox numbers.andP;  While RediLists fulfill thetraditional role of mailing lists--sending the same message to a number ofpeople--anyone desperate to address messages by name can establish mailinglists for individual mailboxes and title each with a person's name.andP;  It'sawkward, but it works.andP;  EasyLink also allows users to assign a two-digitnumerical code to frequently used destinations, such as EasyLink mailboxes,telex terminals, or fax machines.andP;  RediLists and abbreviated address codescan be created only by sending a message with your specifications to WesternUnion's service department.andM;INSTANT COMPENSATIONandM;Western Union's Instant Mail Manager ($150) is a proprietary communicationsprogram that compensates for EasyLink's nonexistent on-line editingfacilities with a word processing module that includes features likecut-and-paste and margin settings.andP;  An address list allows you to forget allabout mailbox numbers and use people's names instead.andP;  A one-keystrokecommand initiates communications and sends messges automatically.andM;While unattended operation is possible with IMM, the program must run in theforeground, and you must capture the entire session to a file.andP;  (The log fileis the only way you know that your messages have been successfullytransmitted.)andP;  Unattended operation allows you to start transmission afteryou've left the office--a 20 percent discount is offered on all messages sentduring off-peak hours.andM;Western Union recently began shipping Office Access for the PC, a $295upgrade to the IMM package; the software addresses some of IMM'sshortcomings.andP;  Pop-up windows allow you to respond to various promptsregarding addressing options or adding a name to your address list.andP;  You cancompress and encrypt files, create electronic forms, and even shell out to amajor word processor (like WordPerfect) to create a message.andP;  Best of all,the program allows background operation.andP;  You must still rely on log files ofthe session, however, to make sure that your file was transmitted correctly.andM;HIGH-END ABILITIESandM;The EasyLink service does provide some useful high-end features.andP;  While itdoes not support such simple features as the creation or storage of on-lineforms, it does support eDI.andP;  (If you don't buy Office Access, you can get the$100 Instant Forms Plus to create forms off-line Office Access includes thefunctionality of both Instant Forms Plus and IMM.)andP;  You also get the abilityto directly transmit binary files.andM;Currently, Western Union's commitment to the X.400 protocol is reflected byconnections to several European PTTs and by EasyLink's participation in theAIA's (Aerospace Industry Association) pilot program for X.400 connectivity.andM;Bulletin board capabilities and extensive database offerings round outEasyLink's services.andP;  For only $.15 per minute, InfoMaster gives you low-costaccess to over 800 independent databases.andP;  FYI News offers briefs on topicsas diverse as foreign finance, flight schedules, and local sports.andM;EasyLink provides a host of features, including many of those found in MCIMail and ATandamp;T Mail.andP;  The clumsy user interface, however, makes it difficultto access those capabilities.andP;  Instant Mail Manager mitigates some ofEasyLink's annoying flaws, and Office Access for the PC goes even further inthis respect.andP;  If you opt for EasyLink, you'll find that one of theproprietary programs is a must.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
