So six years ago, they became systematic investors, putting $50 a month into the San Diego County Employees Investment Club. The club picks stocks to invest in, and members receive shares just as they do in a mutual fund.    The Campbells are delighted with the results. &quot;We averaged a return of more than 20% a year on our money,&quot; says Mrs. Campbell. &quot;This is the only way for average folks like us to get into the stock market.&quot;    But Yale Goldman, 62, of Newton, Mass., a recently retired owner of an insurance company, isn't impressed. &quot;Systematic investing is strictly a sales gimmick by mutual funds and other companies to put people at ease and get them to invest in a product each month,&quot; he says.    Thus a debate continues on the value of systematic investing as a way to buy stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other investment vehicles. Mutual fund executives, investment association officials and some financial planners laud it as the least expensive way, over time, to buy into a stock or mutual fund. They say it also enables millions of people like the Campbells to invest on the installment plan.    Yet a surprisingly large number of investors and financial planners disagree with this approach, which sounds as though it ought to rank with God, motherhood and apple pie as part of the American way. &quot;Too many people blindly systematically invest over a long period in one mutual fund or stock and forget about it,&quot; says John T. Blankinship Jr., a Del Mar, Calif., certified financial planner.    &quot;It's promulgated as an immutable law of financial physics that if you systematically invest, you will be a winner,&quot; Mr. Blankinship says. &quot;That's not necessarily true. You can lose your pants with this approach.&quot;    Mr. Goldman says he was once a systematic investor, putting a set amount each month into mutual funds regardless of the market's direction. &quot;In the end, the mutual funds didn't perform very well,&quot; he says. So he has turned to market timing -- investing a lump sum when he thinks the market is low and selling when, in his opinion, the market is high.    &quot;I'm not infallible,&quot; he says. &quot;But I've done considerably better than the Treasury bond rate down through the years. Thanks to my investments, I retired at 62.&quot;    Even proponents of systematic investing agree that it won't prevent someone from picking a dog. Leeland Beach, a 45-year-old New Orleans classical musician, says he regularly invested $25 a month in a mutual fund for 12 years throughout the 1950s and '60s as &quot;the average man's way to play the market.&quot; The mutual fund took a dive and never came back, he says.    &quot;The technique is strictly for Joe Lunchbucket,&quot; says Jack McCord, president of Vari Investors Services Inc., a La Jolla, Calif., investment adviser. Mr. McCord says he believes there are times to invest and times to be out of the market. &quot;The stock market goes through four and five-year bull and bear markets,&quot; he says. &quot;Sticking your money religiously into the same investment year after year isn't a way to preserve your capital. You must recognize your mistake early if the market is going down and do something about it.&quot;    Advocates of systematic investing say it's impossible to time the market and that most individual investors get killed trying. &quot;It's like trying to pick the fastest line at the bank,&quot; says Bryan Mattes, assistant vice president of the Vanguard group of mutual funds in Valley Forge, Pa. &quot;It's a black art.&quot;    A central concept in systematic investing is dollar-cost averaging. The investor commits a specific amount of money each month to buy a mutual fund or stock, regardless of price levels. When the price is down, he will automatically buy more shares. When it's up, he purchases fewer.    The system levels off the peaks and valleys of share prices but works best if practiced over a full business cycle -- at least five years. &quot;In volatile markets that are trending up over the long term, systematic investing gives you a lower average cost of your stocks over time,&quot; says John D. Markese, director of research for the Chicago-based American Association of Individual Investors. &quot;It's a low-risk technique that fits in well with the individual investor's comfort zone.&quot;    With this approach, the individual investor doesn't have to worry about trying to beat the professionals at market timing. &quot;I gave up on doing that a long time ago,&quot; says Dorwin Robinson, 71, a retired San Francisco investor. Mr. Robinson used systematic investing to purchase the stock of his former employer, Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co., and to buy mutual funds and stocks. He bought the company's stock on a payroll-deduction plan and purchased other stocks through monthly investments in five clubs.    &quot;If you do it on a regular basis, at the end you'll have a nest egg,&quot; he says. Mr. Robinson says he and his wife now have a comfortable retirement because of his systematic investing.    Mr. Markese says the method &quot;gets people thinking about building wealth and committing funds over time.&quot; He adds: &quot;Usually people plunk down a sum after the market's done well. They're too late by that time.&quot;    &quot;Our 100,000 members have been doing systematic investing for 36 years, and we know it produces superior results,&quot; says Thomas G. O'Hara, chairman of National Association of Investors Corp., a Royal Oak, Mich.-based association of investment clubs. Using fundamental analysis, the association helps member clubs pick long-term growth stocks to invest in.    In 16 of the past 26 years, the average association member has outperformed the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index, Mr. O'Hara says. &quot;We've done it by systematic investing, reinvesting the dividends and investing in companies that will be substantially worth more in the future -- not by going in and out,&quot; he says.    Mutual funds, the U.S. government and corporations make it easy for people to systematically invest in their funds, certificates, bonds and stocks by automatically transferring money from bank accounts or paychecks. Investors can also switch funds in a large fund family.    One mutual fund, Fidelity Destiny Fund, operates totally on the systematic approach. Shareholders sign a contract to pay a regular amount into the fund over 15 years. About one-third of Fidelity Destiny's holders are in the U.S. military. &quot;They understand about waiting a long time for the payoff,&quot; one mutual fund official says.    ---   Mr. Gottschalk reports on personal finance from The Wall Street Journal's Los Angeles bureau.                  How Dollar Cost Averaging Works   Shareholders invest equal sums at regular intervals --monthly, quarterly or annually. The result: They acquire moreshares when prices are low, and fewer when prices are high.So, the average cost of acquiring all the shares is less thanthe average of the prices at which the shares were bought.    A sample investment:                                Share    Systematic                  Price            Number    Investment                  Acquired         of Shares    $1,000                      $12.50              80     1,000                       11.50              87     1,000                       10.00             100     1,000                        9.50             105     1,000                        7.50             133     1,000                       10.00             100     1,000                       12.50              80     1,000                       15.00              67   $10,000                     $101.00           1,085    Average cost per share: $9.22    ($10,000 divided by 1,085)    Average price per share: $10;10    ($101.00 divided by 10)   Source: Hopewell Rembert Advisors Inc., 1986</TEXT></DOC>
