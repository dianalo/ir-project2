Syrian President Hafez Assad, an ally of Iran, and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein were brought together Monday night by King Hussein of Jordan, who long has been trying to heal Arab rifts in an effort to unite the Arab world against Iran. This week's Arab summit here is simply his latest attempt. A spokesman for the summit said &quot;good news&quot; would emerge from the &quot;brotherly meeting&quot; in the form of concrete resolutions to be announced when the summit ends today.    But knowledgeable Arab watchers said it will take time to see if Syria and Iraq really have healed the long-running personal feud between Presidents Assad and Hussein. The two met for 13 hours earlier this year with no thaw.    In recent weeks, however, Saudi Arabia, which bankrolls impoverished Syria, has leaned harder on Syria to get in line with other Arabs to put pressure on Iran for an end to the Iraq-Iran war, now in its eighth year.    Still, the guessing here is that Syria hasn't agreed to abandon Iran but will mute its strident support for Iran in return for big payments from Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich sheikdoms on the Persian Gulf. Syria, whose economy is in dire straits, receives oil from Iran in exchange for its friendship. Syria also uses those contacts with Iran to extract payments from Saudi Arabia and other gulf Arabs for interceding on their behalf with Iran.    &quot;Syria came to the summit for one purpose,&quot; said an Arab diplomat. &quot;Money.&quot;    Syria, Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization all have received substantial payments over the past nine years from oil-rich Arabs under a formula worked out at the 1978 Arab summit in Baghdad. Those payments expire this year. Thus, one purpose of this summit is to arrange a new payment schedule for those poorer members of the Arab League.    Iraq, which once contributed to those payments, has been unable to do so in recent years because of the costs of its war with Iran. Iraq has drafted a strongly worded resolution of condemnation of Iran that it hopes will win summit support. An Arab diplomat here said it isn't yet clear whether Syria will agree to Iraq's proposed wording. This diplomat said the thaw in relations between Syria and Iraq is only a start, &quot;and every start is very delicate.&quot;    News of the thaw came amid unconfirmed reports that Saudi Arabia had agreed to make a substantial payment to Syria. A Saudi official confirmed that &quot;a financial matter is under discussion&quot; but said it was incorrect to characterize it as a payoff to Syria for backing away from strident support of Iran.    Western sources said that one reason Saudi King Fahd stayed away from the summit is that he controls the Saudi purse. Thus, his presence would put him on the spot to promise money to Syria before seeing the results of Syria's behavior. Crown Prince Abdullah, who is here, has long been the Saudi connection to Syria and thus, one source said, Prince Abdullah is demanding more Syrian cooperation against Iran, leaving King Fahd free to ante up money only after Syria demonstrates its sincerity.    &quot;Syria has been so skillful at playing the Iranians and the gulf Arabs off against each other for oil and money by threatening each with the other that I'd be cautious about assuming Syria has changed its position,&quot; said a Western official.    While there are at least signs Syria is expressing willingness to tolerate some kind of joint resolution on the gulf war, Syrian President Assad remains implacably opposed to the other major issue at this summit -- readmitting Egypt to the Arab fold.    The Syrian delegation released a statement saying nothing had changed since the Arab League suspended Egypt for making peace with Israel eight years ago.    &quot;The statement is a sign that Syria knows it can't control this issue,&quot; a Western diplomat said.    Indeed, the summit is widely expected to sanction bilateral restoration of full diplomatic relations with Egypt. And Arab diplomats predicted the next few weeks and months will be marked by a widespread resumption of diplomatic relations with Egypt by numerous Arab states, including Iraq and, most importantly, Saudi Arabia.    In a private briefing for Saudi journalists, Crown Prince Abdullah sent a strong signal that Saudi Arabia will be among them. &quot;The Arab world can't live without Egypt and Egypt can't live without the Arab world,&quot; he said, quoting a saying of the late Saudi King Abdul Aziz, founder of Saudi Arabia.    However, Tunisia and Syria already have ruled out such a step, and other states, such as Libya, are likely to.    In another apparent reconciliation, Yasser Arafat, the PLO chairman, had what was described as an amiable meeting with King Hussein, signaling a mend in the rift between these two. The king hasn't worked with Mr. Arafat on the issue of an Israeli-Arab peace conference since early 1986.    A reconciliation would allow the summit to pass a resolution in support of the international peace conference that King Hussein has struggled to convene. However, hardly anyone in the Arab world or the West believes such a conference will be convened during the final year of the Reagan administration because the U.S. is preoccupied with superpower relations this fall, and election-year politics will dominate American thinking in 1988. </TEXT></DOC>
