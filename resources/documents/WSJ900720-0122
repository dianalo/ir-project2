Mr. McEnroe went on to win the match, but his tantrum hadunexpected consequences: The fan filed a suit in NassauCounty, N.Y., claiming $6 million in damages. It was, saysthe judge assigned to the case, &quot;a really good example of alawsuit that should never have been brought.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   But was it frivolous?   More and more, judges are asking that question aboutlawsuits and pleadings. The reason is a growing movement instate and federal courts to punish litigants who makefrivolous arguments by slapping them with fines and othersanctions.   In June, the U.S. Supreme Court gave added impetus to thetrend by upholding a $21,000 fine against a Washington, D.C.,law firm that withdrew an antitrust suit against a clothingmaker only five months after filing it. The allegationsturned out to be groundless. Such penalties are needed, thecourt ruled, as a means &quot;of curbing abuses of the judicialsystem.&quot;   But the trend, welcomed by some as a way to help judgesweed through mounting caseloads, is fueling one of thehottest legal debates today. Judges, lawyers and legalacademics are split over what constitutes frivolouslitigation and under what circumstances fines should beordered.   In the McEnroe case, Nassau County Supreme Court JudgeFrancis X. Becker had no trouble finding the lawsuitfrivolous and throwing it out. But he says he is reluctant todefine frivolous litigation or to impose sanctions.   Lawyers complain that there is little uniformity fromcourt to court on the subject and that judges are arbitraryin their decisions. Fear of being fined for raisinginnovative arguments or bringing unusual suits, critics say,will make lawyers overly cautious, chill imaginative advocacyand constrain access to the courts. Experts agree the problemis particularly acute in areas of the law that are constantlydeveloping, particularly civil rights.   &quot;Today's frivolity may be tomorrow's precedent,&quot; says SolWachtler, chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals.&quot;There has to be a great deal of care paid to {avoid}stifling a lawsuit before it has had time to develop.&quot;   New York is among 28 states where judges can order lawyersto pay fines or legal fees to defendants named in frivoloussuits or court pleadings. The standard most often used issimilar to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,which provides for disciplinary sanctions against lawyers andlitigants in federal court. The rule was toughened in 1983and now requires lawyers to certify before they file a suitthat they have conducted a reasonable inquiry to make sure itis well grounded, both in fact and in legal theory.   Before 1983, judges issued only a handful of sanctionsbecause the rule permitted them only if it could be shownthat lawyers had made arguments in bad faith. Since the rulewas broadened, federal judges have issued 688 publishedopinions on motions by attorneys requesting sanctions againstopposing counsel, says Fordham Law School Prof. Georgene M.Vairo. The requests were granted or strong warnings given innearly 60% of the cases.   Even so, federal judges remain divided on when they shouldcrack down on litigants, and do so with varying frequency.New York and Chicago account for nearly one-third of thereported cases, says Ms. Vairo.   State judges are equally uncertain about how to handlesuits that could be considered frivolous. Take the case ofJudith R. Haimes, a professional psychic in Philadelphia whounderwent a CAT scan of her brain in 1976. The procedure, sheclaimed in a lawsuit, left her with blinding headaches andunable &quot;to read auras.&quot;   Sound dubious? Philadelphia Common Pleas Judge Leon Katzthought so, but he says he still wouldn't have sanctioned thelawyer who brought the case. &quot;Who are we -- the judges -- todetermine in retrospect whether a lawyer should take a case?&quot;asks Judge Katz.   Last month, two Nassau County men went to trial beforeJudge Becker over a fight that took place five years ago whenboth were in high school. The plaintiff claimed he was&quot;sucker punched&quot; in the nose by the defendant. He named hisold nemesis for throwing the punch and the school for notproviding adequate supervision.   &quot;I thought it was frivolous,&quot; says the judge. Not thejury. It awarded the plaintiff $25,000, of which $5,000 mustbe paid by the school.   &quot;At the early stage, it's difficult to tell cases that arejust idiosyncratic from those that may take awhile but willsink in on people as truly having merit,&quot; says Marc Galanter,director of the Institute for Legal Studies at the Universityof Wisconsin, in Madison. Claims such as intentionalinfliction of emotional distress, theories of productliability and numerous civil rights arguments that are nowwoven tightly into law could easily have been dismissed ageneration ago, Mr. Galanter says.   &quot;If we could go back 40 years, the thought of a blackperson at a lunch counter suing because he was refused a mealwould have appeared frivolous,&quot; adds James A. Henderson Jr.,a professor at Cornell University Law School.   Critics of Rule 11 say they are most concerned that thesanctions are being used disproportionately againstplaintiffs in civil rights cases. A year-long study of 121motions seeking Rule 11 sanctions filed in the Third U.S.Circuit concluded that plaintiffs and lawyers in civil rightscases were sanctioned five times as often as theircounterparts in other cases.   The cases ranged from a husband seeking to set aside astate-court divorce settlement to a former federal employeeclaiming wrongful discharge. None involved allegations ofrace, sex or age discrimination, and in all of them, thesanctions appeared appropriate under the rule, says StephenB. Burbank, a University of Pennsylvania Law School professorwho drafted the study report.   Nevertheless, the study warned of the chilling effect therule might have on imaginative civil rights suits.&quot;When youhave a Rule 11 sanction staring at your throat, it gets veryscary when you bring these suits,&quot; says Jon Green, a lawyerat Smith, Mullin andamp; Kiernan in West Orange, N.J., whichspecializes in civil rights.   Most often, sanctions are applied in cases without majorpolicy implications where the abuses appear extreme. Theyfrequently involve individuals who are acting as their ownattorneys. A case in point is James L. Cheek, a pilot forAmerican Airlines who filed a lawsuit in 1985 claiming thatthe withholding of federal income and Social Security taxesamounted to the unconstitutional taking of property.   Mr. Cheek was no stranger to representing himself. In 1983he sued the IRS claiming invasion of privacy. Three yearslater he sued Cook County, Ill., for payment &quot;in gold orsilver&quot; for serving on a jury. A federal judge finallylowered the boom on Mr. Cheek in 1986 for his tax suit andslapped him with an $11,500 fine. (The amount was laterdeemed excessive by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals inChicago and reduced by $5,000.)   Another extreme case involved Bruce A. Coane, a Houstonlawyer who was ordered to pay more than $16,000 in fees andcosts last month by the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsin New Orleans. Mr. Coane alleged that he broke a tooth whenhe bit into a cookie from a Houston bakery. Seeking to settleout of court, Mr. Coane used various tactics to drag the caseout for three years in federal court, then withdrew the suitand refiled it in state court, according to the appeals courtopinion.   Ordered by the federal judge in the case to pay $9,184,Mr. Coane appealed. But the appeal judges were equallyoutraged. Citing &quot;unprofessional and improper motives,&quot; theyslapped Mr. Coane with $6,921 in additional sanctions forarguing a frivolous appeal. &quot;Mr. Coane's efforts to justifyhis misconduct taxes our credulity,&quot; they wrote.   Lawyers who don't adequately investigate whether they havea valid complaint also don't get much sympathy from judges.In the case recently before the U.S. Supreme Court, theWashington, D.C., firm of Cooter andamp; Gell filed an antitrustsuit against Hartmarx Corp., a men's clothing manufacturer.The suit alleged a nationwide conspiracy to fix prices andeliminate competition. The problem was the law firm surveyedonly four Eastern cities before making the allegation.   &quot;{Sanctions} are a useful instrument to make sure lawyersthink more about their obligation to their work,&quot; saysWilliam W. Schwarzer, director of the Federal JudicialCenter, the research arm of the federal court system'sadministrative office.   But critics argue that judges faced with frivolouspleadings have always had the power to dismiss a case or sendmore creative signals.   When a divorcing Long Island couple sued over who wouldget custody of tickets to the New York Islander play-offgames, New York Appeals Judge Anthony DiPaolo was incensed.But even now he's not sure he would have fined the couple. Abetter solution, he says, would have been to keep the ticketsand delay a decision until after the hockey play-offs.&quot;That,&quot; says the judge, &quot;would have been poetic justice.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
