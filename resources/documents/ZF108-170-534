Mac II with 5M bytes of memory.andM;Overall, the autotracing functions of these packages are best-suited toconverting only the basic outlines of simple images.andP;  Even then, users shouldbe prepared to touch up the resulting trace by hand.andP;  Any additional detailis also best done by hand, and most of the programs recommended streamliningthe image at the pixel level.andP;  Particularly for professional graphics shopsthat need to process many complex images, the autotracing function iswoefully inadequate--in both speed and quality.andM;Users who are not required to convert large numbers of bit maps daily intotheir illustration software will find the autotracing functions of thesepackages adequate for their needs.andP;  Also, for users who lack drawing skills,this function provides an easy way to get a head start on a drawing byconverting scanned line art.andM;However, graphics professionals need not despair.andP;  Stand-alone softwarededicated to speedy autotracing of bit maps has filled many gaps in the basictools reviewed here--Adobe's Streamline was introduced last year and isavailable for both the Mac and the PC (see story, Page 86).andP;  And CorelSystems has announced a similar utility that company officials say will bebundled with Corel Draw in March.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
