The judge, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said yesterday that the warrant charges Archbishop Marcinkus, of Cicero, Ill., as &quot;an accessory to fraudulent bankruptcy&quot; in Italy's biggest bank failure.    The judge said police are currently unable to serve the warrant on the 65-year-old archbishop because he resides in the Vatican, which has the status of a foreign state.    Italy has no extradition treaty with the Vatican, and court sources said there is unlikely to be an official announcement about the warrant until there is an arrest.    Archbishop Marcinkus, reached at the Vatican last night by Italian journalists, responded to the reports by saying, &quot;Up to this moment, I have not received anything,&quot; according to the ANSA news agency and state-run RAI television.    Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said he had heard the reports but knew &quot;nothing about it.&quot;    Milan judges Antonio Pizzi and Renato Bricchetti, who have long been investigating the banking scandal, declined to comment publicly on the case.    Yesterday, the Naples daily newspaper Il Mattino quoted unidentifed court sources as saying an arrest warrant had been issued for Archbishop Marcinkus.    Archbishop Marcinkus -- who heads the Istituto per le Opere di Religione, or IOR -- was charged along with two other senior Vatican bank officials, Luigi Mennini and Pellegrino De Strobel, sources said.    Mr. Mennini, a managing director of the IOR, and Mr. De Strobel, chief accountant, are Italian citizens, but also live at the Vatican. Both men also are charged as accessories to fraudulent bankruptcy, the sources said.    Any judicial notices, including arrest warrants, must be formally transmitted to the Vatican through the Italian Embassy to the Holy See.    Italian Foreign Ministry officials said they hadn't received any official notice about the warrants as of last night. They added that it is unlikely anything would be made public because of &quot;the delicate nature of the case.&quot;    The U.S. archbishop, who has served as bodyguard and advance man during the many foreign trips of Pope John Paul II, has long been investigated in connection with $1.3 billion in loans made by Banco Ambrosiano to 10 overseas &quot;dummy&quot; companies controlled by the IOR.    The missing $1.3 billion led to the collapse and bankruptcy of the Milan private bank, headed the time by secretive banker Roberto Calvi. Mr. Calvi was later found hanging from a bridge in London.    IOR, which originally held a significant stake in Banco Ambrosiano, in 1984 agreed to a payment of $250 million as part of the final settlement of the long-running affair. However the Vatican refused to acknowledge that its payment was an admission of responsibility for the bank's bankruptcy.    The episode apparently brought Archbishop Marcinkus's rapid rise in the church hierarchy to an end. Although he remained chairman of IOR, he was passed over for what had been a widely expected promotion to cardinal. Also, his position as acting head of the Vatican City state administration was downgraded.    A group of Italian banks, which took over assets of the collapsed bank, later founded Nuovo Banco Ambrosiano S.p.A.    During the past few years, investigating judges have dispatched notices to Archbishop Marcinkus and the two other IOR officials, telling them that they were being investigated in connection with the Banco Ambrosiano case.    The Vatican, however, rejected the notices, saying they hadn't been transmitted through appropriate diplomatic channels.    &quot;They have always refused to be questioned in the case,&quot; Mr. Pizzi said.    The collapse of Banco Ambrosiano was one of the major postwar financial scandals in Italy and also triggered the bankruptcy of the Rizzoli publishing group, which had received substantial loans from the bank. </TEXT></DOC>
