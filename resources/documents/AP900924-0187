As world leaders prepared for this weekend's World Summit forChildren, the London-based human rights organization describedviolations in 19 countries including Iraq, Israel, South Africa andthe United States.   ``Of all the victims of human rights violations, children areamong the least able to stand up for their rights. Governments musttherefore be particularly vigilant in protecting those rights,''Amnesty said in an appeal.   UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, is organizing thesummit that will discuss ways of improving the lot of millions ofchildren whose lives are threatened by poverty, disease ormalnutrition.   At least 60 heads of state, including President Bush and BritishPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher, will meet Sept. 29-30 at theUnited Nations headquarters in New York.   Amnesty said children are used as pawns to get their parents toturn themselves in or to make confessions, and often are victims ofpolitical and military unrest.   ``All too often children are victimized simply because of wherethey live or who their parents are. Sometimes their age alone makesthem targets for abuse,'' it said.   In Iraq, it said, hundreds of children had disappeared or beentortured. ``In Iraq, too, hundreds more children have died inchemical weapons attacks on Kurdish communities, which claimed thelives of thousands of people,'' Amnesty said.   In Israel, it said, Palestinian children have been victims ofrights violations ``virtually daily since the beginning of theintefadeh,'' the Palestinian uprising.   Of the more than 600 people shot dead by security forces, 153have been children, Amnesty said. ``In an alarmingly high number ofincidents, the children did not appear to have been involved in anylife-threatening activity,'' it added.   In Liberia, Amnesty said children have been among the thousandsof civilians arbitrarily killed or mutilated by government forcesand their armed opponents.   During the states of emergency in South Africa from 1985-87, itsaid, an estimated 10,000 children were detained without charge ortrial, some for more than a year.   Amnesty said children are often deliberately targeted for rightsviolations because they are seen as a social or political threat.   ``In Brazil and Guatemala, where the number of street childrenhas grown dramatically in recent years ... they are tortured andextrajudicially executed by police ... often in the name of`cleaning up the streets','' Amnesty said.   In China, it said, children were among more than 1,000 peoplekilled when troops fired on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijingin June 1989.   The international rights group said the United States was one ofseven countries that has reportedly executed minors the past 10years.   The United States ``has 35 prisoners on death row who were under18 when they committed their crime. One such prisoner, DaltonPrejean, was executed this year,'' Amnesty said.   Amnesty also gave examples of violations in Albania, Argentina,Bolivia, Chad, El Salvador, Mauritania, Burma, Nigeria, Peru,Philippines, Sri Lanka and Turkey.</TEXT></DOC>
