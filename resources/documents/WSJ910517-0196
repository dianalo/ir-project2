Several areas of this research have been submitted tometa-analysis, the preferred scientific procedure for drawingdefinitive conclusions about large bodies of research. Ameta-analysis of 146 independent outcomes on TM and otherforms of meditation and relaxation found the effect of TM ontrait-anxiety reduction (an indicator of chronic stress) wastwice as large as that of other techniques. This studycontrolled for such possible confounding variables asexperimenter attitude, type of publication and attrition. Infact, TM was found to be three times as effective as otherrelaxation and meditation techniques when only publishedstudies with the strongest experimental design (randomassignment with low attrition) were included. The strongestresults for TM were found by researchers who were neutral ornegative toward TM, not by &quot;devotees.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   In the past 20 years, TM has been taught to more than2,000 inmates in 18 U.S. correctional institutions, and toseveral hundred juveniles in eight U.S. facilities. A studyof recidivism published in the Journal of Criminal Justicefound that 259 inmates of Folsom and San Quentin prisons andDeuel Vocational Institute in California who learned TM hadsignificantly more favorable parole outcomes each year fromone to five years after release compared with controlsmatched for parole year, offense, prior commitment record,institution, race, age and drug-abuse history. There was aproportional reduction of more than 40% in new prison termsfor the TM group, compared with the matched controls. Thestudy also showed that none of the other educational andcounseling programs had any effect on recidivism. TM alonesaved the state of California more than a million dollars.   The expense of all of these prison programs has been borneby the TM organization. It's time the various state andnational corrections agencies bear the expense of a programthat actually works.   You conclude that it would cost $1 billion to provide TMfor the entire U.S. correctional system. This should beconsidered in the context that we spend more than $18 billiona year on corrections. If we save only 40% by using TM, asthe research conservatively indicates, that would be a $6.2billion cost benefit per year.   David Orme-Johnson   Chairman, Psychology Program   Maharishi International University   Fairfield, Iowa   ---   Transcendental Meditation is a religion. If a Christianpreacher proposed to convert inmates for a $1,500 fee, suchas TM proponents seek, he would be laughed to scorn. Thechants used in this &quot;mind-opening technique,&quot; as your articleterms it, are merely names of Hindu gods, assigned to eachfollower according to his age. Religion of any sort has noplace as a paid mental-health methodology in the prisons orin any institution our taxes pay for.   Jeanette S. Anderson   Indianapolis   ---   Our &quot;get-tough&quot; approach on crime has created overflowingjails, more hardened criminals, cost the taxpayers billions,and caused endless human suffering, with about 1.1 millionpeople behind bars and more than 2% of the adult populationin prison, on probation or parole.   The idea that throwing an individual in with a bunch ofhardened criminals somehow will reform him is ludicrous. Inprisons where it has been applied, the TM program has beenshown to save at least $3 to $4 for every dollar investedthrough reduced recidivism and health-care costs. Isn't ithigh time we all started taking seriously the alternatives tothe current madness?   Craig Edwards   President   Maharishi Consultants International   Fairfield, Iowa</TEXT></DOC>
