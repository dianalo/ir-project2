In the area ofsolar energy, these include photovoltaically-powered houses, factories,automobiles, and remote power systems, as well as parabolic collectorsfor concentrating solar energy and solar ponds for energy storage. Othersignificant developments include solar production of hydrogen from waterand industrial scale solar water heating systems in Ontario. The possibilitiesof using wind energy have been shown in Californian and European windturbine installations, and in new sail designs for large ships. Biomassenergy innovations include development of certain kinds of hitherto-neglectedplants as sources for conversion to fuels, burning of wood or wood pellets,producing methane from manures and waste biomass, and use of ammoniaand alcohol fuels. Other renewable energy projects described in thisreport include small hydroelectric power plants, wave energy converters,ocean thermal energy converters, fuel cells, and geothermal power plants.Developments in energy conservation and efficiency are also outlined,including the use of dirigibles in air transport, use of ice blocks formedduring winter for air conditioning, flywheel energy storage, improvedelectric batteries, passive solar heating, energy conserving buildings,heat exchangers and heat pumps, and energy efficient appliances. 35 figs.,1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
