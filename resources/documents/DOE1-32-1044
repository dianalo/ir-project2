Per MAP3S protocolall samples were shipped to the analytical laboratories at Pacific NorthwestLaboratories for more detailed analysis. Data from the precipitationsamples and raingage have been logged on a routine basis according tostandard procedure. A data-base management program is being set up onan IBM-PC class computer to record site-specific data. Comparisons betweenthe precipitation pH values measured in our own laboratory and thosemeasured in the primary laboratory at PNL have been made. This is partlyan effort to assess the effects of sample storage and shipping and partlyfor the purpose of tracking the quality of our sample-handling procedures.While the correlation coefficient is relatively high, 0.98, suggestingoverall good preservation of sample quality, several marked departuresfrom agreement occur in specific instances. 1 fig., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
