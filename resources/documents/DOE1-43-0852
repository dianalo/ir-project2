Both DTS and SShad a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 90.6% for HCC. There werethree false positive cases (9.4%), two of which were occult abscesses.The predictive value of a positive test was 89% and that of a negativetest was 97%. The smallest tumor detected measured 2 cm in diameter andwas only visualized with the SS. In the clinical setting, when HCC issuspected (a situation in which tumors are usually larger than 2 cm andthe pretest probability of disease is between 20% and 60%) the DTS andSS is an excellent test for the diagnosis or exclusion of HCC. It doesnot appear to have a role in screening programs.</TEXT></DOC>
