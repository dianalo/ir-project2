Justification</ITAG>1. <T3>Background.</T3> Section 24(a) of the Occupational Safety and HealthAct of 1970 (29 USC 651) requires the Secretary of Labor_in consultationwith the Secretary of Health and Human Services_to develop and maintainan effective program of collection, compilation, and analysis of statisticson occupational injuries and illnesses. Section 24 also encourages theFederal government to enlist the aid of States in developing and conductingstatistical programs to meet the data needs of the States as well as itsown. Sections 8(c)(1), (2), 8(g)(2), 24(a), and 24(e) of the Act specificallyrequire the Secretary of Labor to design and implement a system requiringemployers covered by the Act to maintain records of occupational injuriesand illnesses and to submit periodic reports to the Secretary of Laborupon request.In Secretary's Order No. 12-71, the Secretary of Labor delegated to theCommissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) the responsibilityfor ``Furthering the purpose of the Occupational Safety and Health Actby developing and maintaining an effective program of collection, compilation,analysis and publication of occupational safety and health statistics.''The Secretary further directed the Commissioner to coordinate the abovefunctions with the Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration (OSHA). The regulations concerning recordkeeping, reportingand access to records, developed in cooperation with OSHA, are containedin 29 CFR Part 1904.Copies of the appropriate sections of the OSH Act, 29 CFR Part 1904, andthe annual survey form, OSHA No. 200-S, are included in appendices to thispackage. Recordkeeping forms and recordkeeping guidelines promulgated under29 CFR Part 1904 are currently awaiting OMB approval (1220-0029) with anexpected expiration date of December 31, 1990. Recordkeeping burden foremployers prenotified for the annual survey is included in the OMB No.1220-0029 inventory.2. <T3>Reasons for survey.</T3> The purpose of the Act, as stated in Section2(b), is to assure, as far as possible, every working man and woman inthe Nation safe and healthful working conditions. The primary nationalmeasure of the progress toward achieving this purpose is the change inthe overall rate of occurrence of work injuries and illnesses (by industry),i.e., the Total Recorded Cases (TRC) rate. To determine the change in therate, it is necessary to annually determine the number of work injury andillness cases and the level of workers' exposure. Additionally, the Actplaces special emphasis on serious and disabling cases, work illnessesand work fatalities. To measure the progress in these areas, it is necessaryfor the survey to provide accurate statistics on the appropriate subclassificationsof work injury and illness cases.The annual OSH survey, conducted by BLS and cooperating State agencies,provides data which not only meet all the requirements of the Act but alsoare used in virtually every area of OSHA's program. Data from the surveyare used to prioritize OSHA's scarce resources. Data are essential to targetindustries for inspection and in evaluating the effectiveness of Federaland State programs in improving workplace safety and health of workers.For these reasons, it is necessary to provide estimates separately fornon-18(b) States and for 18(b) States. To evaluate the effectiveness ofthe Federal and State programs over time, the industry detail producedby the survey must be at the same industry level and with the same reliabilityas in previous surveys.Further, the data also play an important part in the administrative proceduresmandated by the Supreme Court that allow OSHA to obtain search warrants.Others using the survey data include NIOSH, local government agencies,academia, various corporations in the private sector and the general public.Efforts to fulfill the Congressional mandate that the Federal governmentprotect employees from safety and health dangers on the job would be severelyhampered by incomplete, inconsistent, and inaccurate data. Therefore, theannual OSH survey should be maintained at its current level due to thewidespread use of the information it produces and the absence of superiorsubstitute sources of such information.3. <T3>Use of technology to reduce employer burden.</T3> During 1978 and 1979,the recordkeeping survey collection form was modified which resulted inan estimated 75 percent reduction in time spent by employers to completethe survey form. The changes initiated resulted from modification of thebasic records employers are required to maintain.Basic records are also permitted to be maintained in facsimile on dataprocessing equipment, subject to restrictions in 29 CFR Part 1904.2. Useof such technology, including the advantages of centralization, has reducedemployers' burden.BLS has also implemented a special subsampling procedure for large multi-establishmentcompanies. Some companies felt overly burdened by survey requests coveringa number of establishments normally clustered in the Unemployment Insurance(U.I.) sampling frame. Lists of individual establishments of multi-establishmentcompanies are not normally available for use by BLS for sampling for thesurvey. If mutual benefits may result from the procedure, the company wasasked to voluntarily supply BLS with establishment detail including address,employment, identifying information (company store number, etc.), StandardIndustrial Classification (SIC) code or equivalent information, and StateU.I. account number. This information was then coded by the Bureau andthe resulting file used for sampling for the annual OSH survey. Approximately5,700 of the 280,000 respondents to the annual survey are selected fromthis file.Currently 230 companies with 58,258 establishments are included in thisspecial subsampling procedure. As a result the vast majority of their burdencomplaints regarding the mandatory OSH survey have been satisfactorilyresolved.By using improved statistical and sampling techniques, the BLS has beenable to reduce the survey sample size from 650,000 in 1972 to 240,000 privatesector establishments and 40,000 government agencies in 1988 (AppendixD). Recordkeeping exemptions have reduced the number of establishmentsregularly keeping records from over 3 million in 1972 to about 975,000in 1988.4. <T3>Efforts to identify duplication.</T3> As nearly all employers are coveredby the Act, the survey is able by itself to produce statistics for almostall industries. However, to provide comprehensive, private sector estimates,it is necessary to secure data from other Federal agencies having statutoryauthority affecting the safety and health of employees in coal, metal,and other nonmetal mining; on railroads; and in nuclear energy facilities.Since passage of the Act in 1970, BLS has explored with agencies whichhad safety and health mandates the feasibility of adopting the OSHA recordkeepingdefinitions. In this way, all employers would be maintaining equivalentrecords and thus would facilitate the collection of uniform statisticsfor compilation of national private sector estimates.Data conforming to OSHA recordkeeping definitions are provided by the MineSafety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for miningemployers and by the Federal Railroad Administration, U.S. Department ofTransportation, for railroad employers. Participation in the BLS annualsurvey by contractors who operate nuclear energy facilities became a requirementof the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) in 1971. Tosatisfy ERDA requirements, these contractors furnish ERDA with a duplicatecopy of the completed survey form.In addition, sampling files are checked manually and mechanically by BLSand State staff for duplication.5. <T3>Availability of data from existing sources.</T3> The work injury andillness data to be collected in the survey are not available from any othersource. The only existing large body of work injury and illness informationis located in workers' compensation programs; however, many States do notinclude all the specific kinds of work-related cases which the Act requiresemployers to record and report.Additionally, coverage and reporting differences among States and lackof uniformly complete records prevent the workers' compensation programsfrom providing statistically accurate data for national estimates. Therefore,data from State workers' compensation programs cannot serve as a replacementfor the annual survey.6. <T3>Minimizing small employer burden. </T3>Since the small employers havelesser impact on the estimates than the larger employers, BLS minimizesthe burden upon small employers by using a highly efficient stratifiedrandom sampling plan. Under this sampling plan, the larger employment unitswithin an industry have a higher probability of selection than the smalleremployment units. As can be determined from the attached tables (AppendixE), on average small employers (1-10 employees) are sampled successfullyat the rate of 1.9 percent, while the large employers (500 employees andabove) are sampled at the rate of 64.5 percent. Thus, chances of sampleselection for small employers is fairly minimal.The recordkeeping regulations in 29 CFR Part 1904 exempt small employers(those with less than 11 employees) in all industries from routinely keepingOSHA records. Their participation is only required if they are prenotifiedin advance that they are required to participate in the survey for a givenyear.In addition, the Labor-HHS appropriation limits OSHA's activities concerningsmall farm employers. In essence, farm employers with 10 or fewer employeesare totally exempt from any OSHA regulation or activity involving Federalfunds and are, therefore, omitted from the survey sample. Pending any permanentchange in the regulations, OSHA will continue to exempt this group of farmemployers.7. <T3>Consequence of less frequent collection. </T3>Operational and budgetaryissues make collecting survey data annually essential. The annual surveyis a cooperative program with State agencies which are partially fundedby the Federal government to collect and process the survey data, and sharethe data with the BLS for generating national estimates. Since the Stategrant agencies must finance half the costs by appropriation requests totheir own State legislatures, many of which convene and appropriate fundsover a cycle which may be different from the Federal budget cycle, it islikely that many States would drop out of the program rather than participatein a program of less frequent scheduling. If States do drop out, the Federalgovernment would need to assume the collection of the data at an increasedcost.At a joint meeting of the Occupational Safety and Health Statistics Committeeof the Labor Research Advisory Council and the Business Research AdvisoryCouncil on August 4, 1977, a resolution was adopted opposing a change inthe frequency of the annual survey. The resolution asserted that a lessfrequent survey would be ``less responsive to the needs and considerationsof the profession, Congress, and the public if carried out at less frequentperiods.''8. <T3>Inconsistencies with 5 CFR Part 1320.6 guidelines. </T3>The forms andguidelines are in accordance with 5 CFR 1320.6.9. <T3>Consultations. </T3>Semiannually, BLS meets with program committeesof the Business Research Advisary Council and the Labor Research AdvisoryCouncil to review programs and to solicit advice and recommendations forprogram enhancement. Following are the names of the committee chairmen:<ITAG tagnum="15">Committee on Occupational Safety and Health, Business Research AdvisoryCouncil, Chairman, Raymond C. Ellis, Jr., American Hotel and Motel Association,202-289-3100;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Committee on Occupational Safety and Health, Labor Research AdvisoryCouncil, Chairman, Eric Frumin, Amalgamated Clothing and Textile WorkersUnion, 212-242-0700.</ITAG>Annually, BLS holds a conference with the State agencies which receivegrants or contracts to conduct the annual survey, and meets periodicallywith OSHA and NIOSH representatives. A list of State agency representativesis available on request.

Periodically BLS consults with OMB and receivesOMB approval of the annual survey package. The current OMB contact is MiloSunderhauf.10. <T3>Confidentiality. </T3>Commissioner's Order No. 2-80 outlines BLS policyregarding the confidentiality of records. The State agencies are boundto this policy. The policy states: ``In conformance with existing law andDepartment regulations, it is the policy of the Bureau of Labor Statisticsthat data collected or maintained by, or under the auspices of the Bureauunder a pledge of confidentiality shall be treated in a manner that willassure that individually identifiable data will be accessible only to authorizedpersons and will be used only for statistical purposes or for other purposesmade known in advance to the respondent.''The reporting form, OSHA No. 200-S, carries the statement: ``The informationcollected on this form will be used for statistical purposes only by theBLS, OSHA and the cooperating State agencies.''11. <T3>Sensitive questions. </T3>None are asked.12. <T3>Cost to the Federal government. </T3>The total cost for collectingand processing the annual survey data will be approximately $5.3 million.Further information will be furnished on request. Respondent cost is estimatedat $760,000 based on a wage of $10 an hour plus postage.13. <T3>Estimation of respondent burden. </T3>Based on experience with thecurrent survey form which has been used since the 1978 survey, each ofthe 280,000 sample units will spend an average of 15 minutes to completethe form. The total burden is therefore 70,000 hours. A reporting burdenstatement is included in the instructions for completion of the OSHA No.200-S.All employers in the sample are required by 29 CFR Parts 1904.2(a), (b),1904.15(b), and 1904.16(a) (by prenotification) to have maintained a Logand Summary of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses (OSHA No. 200). Completionof the injury and illness summary (section VI) of form OSHA No. 200-S requirescopying the data from the TOTAL line of Form OSHA No. 200. For the questionon the description of the cause of the fatality, from previous surveysit is estimated that less than 1 percent of the survey respondents willneed to provide this information. Data for the questions on average employmentand hours worked are directly available or easily estimated from recordsrequired by other State or Federal government programs.Estimation of recordkeeping burden for the prenotified employers coveredunder 29 CFR 1904.15(b) and 16(a) is incorporated in OMB No. 1220-0029.14. <T3>Change in burden hours.</T3> Total burden hours have been reduced by2,500, from 72,500 to 70,000 hours. The change is due to the eliminationof the burden, on companies which are selected from the sampling frameof large multi-establishment companies, to update their company files.The multi-establishment sampling procedure will be dropped in calendaryear 1991 due to the planned improvements to the U.I. sampling frame.15. <T3>Tabulation/publication timetable. </T3>Results from the survey arepublished in a press release and in a bulletin. Data are also publishedin the President's Report on Occupational Safety and Health, an annualreport to the U.S. Congress.Listed below is a summary timetable which identifies the major collectionphases and tentative dates for publishing the data.<ITAG tagnum="15">December_Prenotification mailing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">January_Initial mailing of OSHA No. 200-S forms to sample units.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">February_Second request mailing to nonrespondents.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">May_Key nonrespondents identified and follow-up initiated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">May_Certified mailing to key nonrespondents completed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">July_Active collection of data closed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">November_Results issued in news release.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">May_Detailed results issued in a bulletin.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">B. Collection of information employing statistical methods</ITAG>1. Description of universe and sample<T3>Universe.</T3> The potential number of respondents (establishments)covered by the scope of the survey is 5 million, although less than 1 millionemployers keep records on a routine basis due to recordkeeping exemptionsfor employers in low hazard industries and employers with less than 11employees, or having no recordable cases. The occupational injury and illnessdata reported through the annual survey are based on records which employersin the following industries maintain under the Occupational Safety andHealth Act: Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, SIC 01-09; oil and gasextraction, SIC 13; construction, SIC 15-17; manufacturing, SIC 20-39;transportation and public utilities, SIC 41-42 and 44-49; wholesale trade,SIC 50-51; and selected prenotified units in retail trade, SIC 52-59; finance,insurance, and real estate, SIC 60-67; and services, SIC 70-87 and 89.Excluded from the national survey collection are self-employed individuals;farmers with fewer than 11 employees; employers regulated by other Federalsafety and health laws; and Federal, State, and local government agencies.Some participating States collect data from State and local governmentagencies for use in their State estimates.<T3>Sample. </T3>A stratified probability sampling design is used for thesurvey, and the sample is selected by using a systematic sampling procedurewith a random start for each strata. Based on the survey's design criteria,a sample of 280,000 private and government respondents from a potentialuniverse of 5 million establishments is required. The units on the frameare stratified based on geography, industry, and employment. Since thesurvey is a Federal-State cooperative effort, the first characteristicused to stratify the units is the State; this is to enable all the Stategrantees participating in the survey to produce estimates at the Statelevel. The units are further stratified by SIC code and employment sizeclass. Hence, the total number of possible stratification cells is approximately234,000 (i.e., STandmultiply;SICandmultiply;SZC = 52andmultiply;500andmultiply;9).A condensed summary of the sampling frame and the sample at the nationallevel by major industry divisions is provided in the attached table (AppendixE). Additional detailed tables are available upon request.<T3>Response rate. </T3>The survey is a mandatory survey with an overalluseable response rate of about 94 percent based on the 1987 survey data(latest survey for which data are tabulated). The response rate for futuresurveys is expected to be about the same.2. Statistical methodology.<T3>Survey design. </T3>The annual survey is fully based on probabilitysurvey design theory and methodology at both the national and State designlevels. This methodology provides:andbullet; A statistical foundation for drawing inference to the full universebeing studied.andbullet; A basis for developing a required sample size to satisfy surveyreliability requirements.While there were many characteristics upon which the national design couldhave been based, BLS elected to use the TRC rate. This was considered byBLS to be one of the most important characteristics and, importantly, theleast variable therefore requiring the smallest sample size.Additionally, to fulfill the needs of users of the survey statistics, thesample is to provide industry estimates. A list of the industries for whichestimates are required is compiled by BLS after consultation with the principalFederal users. The sample is designed to generate data at the 2-digit SICindustry level in agriculture, forestry, and fishing; the 3-digit levelin oil and gas extraction, construction, and transportation and publicutilities; the 4-digit level in manufacturing; and the 2-digit level inSIC's 50-89, except for some 3- and 4-digit estimates for high rate industriesin this range of SIC's as required by OSHA.<T3>Sample procedure. </T3>The principal features of the OSH probabilitysample design are its use of stratified random sampling with a Neyman allocation.The characteristics used to stratify the units are the State, SIC code,and employment size class. Since these characteristics are highly correlatedwith the characteristics that the survey is to measure, stratified samplingprovides a gain in precision and thus results in a smaller sample size.The Neyman allocation procedure produces the minimum sample size requiredto achieve the desired level of reliability for an estimate. For largeremployment size classes, the allocation procedures place virtually allof the establishments of the frame in the sample; as employment decreases,smaller and smaller proportions of establishments are included in the sample.As mentioned before, a probability sample is selected by using a systematicsampling procedure with a random start for each strata.The survey will be conducted by mail questionnarie through BLS-Washingtonand the State statistical grant agencies and State contract agencies receivingFederal funds to participate in the survey.<T3>Estimation procedure. </T3>The survey's estimates of the populationtotal are first based on the Horvitz-Thompson estimator which is an unbiasedestimator. The precision of the estimates is further improved, hence areduction in sample size, by using the ratio estimator which utilizes availableauxiliary information that is correlated with the characteristics whichare to be measured. The estimates of the incidence rates are calculatedas: N/EH andmultiply; 200,000, where:<ITAG tagnum="26">N = number of injuries and illnesses or lost workdays</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">EH = total hours worked by all employees during a calendar year </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">200,000 = base for 100 full-time equivalent workers (working 40 hoursper week, 50 weeks per year).</ITAG><T3>Required accuracy. </T3>For the national all industry estimate of theTRC rate, the sample size is set to insure that a year-to-year differenceof .10 or more will be statistically significant at the 95 percent confidencelevel. A target relative sampling error for year-to-year changes in theTRC rate is also set for each industry estimate requried by OSHA. Thesetargets vary from 8 percent to 37 percent at the 95 percent confidencelevel with the average being 15 percent.All State statistical grant agencies participating in the survey produceindustry estimates at the State level. To enable these States to producereliable estimates, their samples are supplemented with additional units.In the recent annual surveys (1978-87), these supplemental units have alsobeen used in the national estimates.<T3>Unusual problems.</T3> The primary sampling source for the annual OSHsurvey is each State's Unemployment Insurance Account address file. Dependingon the State, address records may be at the establishment level, a country-widelevel, or even a State-wide level. In the case of large multiple-establishmentcompanies, a record may cover a large number of establishments requiringthe consolidation of each establishment's OSHA records into a single surveyreport. Some companies have perceived these survey reports as overly burdensome.In response, the Bureau devised a special subsampling procedure based onestablishment lists <T3>voluntarily </T3>provided by companies in past years. Currently 230companies with 58,258 establishments have provided establishment lists.Sample units are selected from this file using the same statistical methodologyas the regular sample. Duplication of reports between files is eliminatedusing a mechanical method utilizing Unemployment Insurance Account numbersand manually reviewing sample units.3. Statistical reliability <T3>Response rates and nonresponse adjustment.</T3> The survey is a mandatorysurvey which achieves an overall usable response rate of about 94 percent.The following techniques are employed to help maximize survey response:andbullet; A follow-up mailing to nonrespondents in February. andbullet; A certified mailing/or telephone follow-up of key nonrespondentsin May. This high level of response greatly aids in protecting the survey estimatesfrom nonresponse bias. The data for the remaining 6 percent, that is thenonrespondents, are imputed from the respondent data using a weightingcell adjustment technique. <T3>Survey sampling errors.</T3> The survey utilizes a full probabilitysurvey design which makes it possible to determine the required samplesize needed to satisfy the specified level of reliability for survey estimates.In addition, it permits the calculation of the <T3>achieved</T3> level of reliability (i.e., the sampling error) for eachsurvey estimate. The survey in its design and implementation controls on the required levelof reliability for the survey estimates and produces the required surveyestimates along with the corresponding estimates of sampling error at thenational level. Based on past surveys (1972-87), the estimates of the samplingerrors obtained from the survey are very close to the required (target)levels. As in the past, it is expected that the OSH survey data will yieldthe required level of reliability for the national TRC rate, for the industryand State detail required by OSHA, and for the industry detail requiredby the States. 4. <T3>Testing procedures.</T3> the survey was first undertaken in 1972 witha sample size of approximately 650,000. Since then BLS has made significantprogress toward reducing respondent burden by employing various statisticalsurvey design techniques; the present sample size is about 280,000. BLSis continually researching for methods that will reduce the respondentburden without jeopardizing the reliability of the estimates. At the presenttime, BLS has underway several pilot surveys to test alternative data collectionforms and procedures. Present plans anticipate implementation of a revisedrecordkeeping system in calendar year 1991. Currently, BLS also utilizesquality control techniques to maintain the current system's high levelof reliability. 5. <T3>Statistical responsibility.</T3> The Statistical Methods Group, Chief,Phil Gilliland is responsible for the sample design which includes selectionand estimation.
