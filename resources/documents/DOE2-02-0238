Differential centrifugation and separation techniques havedemonstrated that, at the subcellular level, technetium in the pyloriccaeca was largely associated with the lysosomes. /sup 95m/Tc (IV) wasdistributed between the lysosomes and the soluble fraction to roughlythe same degree, whereas pertechnetate was more strongly associated withthe lysosomal fraction. Chromatography of the cytosol by gel filtrationindicated the presence of two distinct protein compounds which were responsiblefor binding virtually all of the technetium in the soluble fraction.Technetium had a greater relative affinity for the low molecular weightcompound, more so for Tc (VII) than for Tc (IV). This anionic proteinhad an apparent molecular weight of approximately 10 000, and thus mayplay a role in metal detoxification mechanisms at the cellular level.</TEXT></DOC>
