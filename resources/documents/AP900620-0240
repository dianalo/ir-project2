The Court of Chancery in New Castle County, Delaware, ruled infavor of a group of minority shareholders, who had sued over theterms of the buyout.   Tuesday's ruling did not determine how much the former owners of15 million shares of Shell stock should be awarded, said Houstonattorney Ken McNeil, who represented the plaintiffs.   The judge asked both sides to submit recommendations on theaward but did not set a date for a hearing on the matter.   The violation occurred ``because the defendant failed todisclose the existence of oil and gas reserves having a value ofapproximately $1 billion,'' the court ruling said.   The class action lawsuit was filed by the former Shell minorityshareholders against Shell Petroleum Inc., the Royal Dutch-Shellsubsidiary that bought out Shell Oil's minority shareholders inJune 1985.   The Anglo-Dutch oil giant had owned 69.4 percent of Shell Oil.It initially offered $55 a share for the remainder, raised the bidto $58 and finally agreed to pay an extra $2 a share to settle alawsuit by some minority shareholders.   The Delaware trial was limited to the issue of whether adequatedisclosure was made in materials sent to the former Shellstockholders advising them of their option to accept the RoyalDutch-Shell offer or seek an appraisal of the fair value of theirshares, McNeil said.   H.R. Hutchins, a spokesman for Houston-based Shell, said thecompany was disappointed with the court's decision.   ``The court based it's decision on an inadvertent error whichleft out about 8 percent of the discounted future net cash flowfrom estimated oil and gas reserves,'' Hutchins said.   ``The discounted cash flow analysis is `soft' data because it isbased on numerous assumptions and estimates. In view of thevoluminous information that was furnished to the shareholders, webelieve they could readily have made an informed decision withrespect to the 1985 merger proposal.''   In a separate proceeding, the same Delaware court is determiningthe appraisal value of the Shell Oil stock for former owners of 1million shares, who rejected the $60-a-share offer. These formerowners have claimed the shares were worth up to $110 each.</TEXT></DOC>
