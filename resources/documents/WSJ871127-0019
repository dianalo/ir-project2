A spokesman for McDonnell Douglas of Canada Ltd. said large numbers of employees, since Nov. 18, have spent their shifts in company cafeterias instead of at work stations, including 1,500 of 2,600 employees on yesterday's day shift.    Under the agreement, members of the Canadian Auto Workers union will gradually return to work until 85% of the plant's 3,500 employees have returned by Dec. 11.    The work stoppage followed the release earlier this month of an Ontario government report citing McDonnell Douglas for a variety of health and safety violations in the 49-year-old plant.    The company has resolved most of them and is awaiting verification by union and government inspectors, the spokesman said. In compliance with Ontario law, employees will be paid for all time off the job from Nov. 18 until the required changes are made, the spokesman added. Employees who aren't back to work by Dec. 11 will be given additional time to learn proper safety procedures.    A government official said McDonnell Douglas must submit by Jan. 10 a report on its plans to upgrade the plant's ventilation system, which was cited by union officials as a main cause of the work stoppage. The plant uses several hundred industrial chemicals to make tail sections, wings and other parts for McDonnell Douglas's commercial and military aircraft.    The McDonnell spokesman said the production slowdown is expected to cause some delays in McDonnell Douglas assembly operations at St. Louis and Long Beach, Calif. He didn't elaborate. </TEXT></DOC>
