Employing standard perturbation techniques, the wave scatteringfrom a Gaussian spectrum of density fluctuations and the self-modulationresulting from the ponderomotive force nonlinearity are investigated.The results for the typical parameters of the PLT tokamak [Phys. Rev.Lett. 54, 2339 (1985)] and the ALCATOR-C tokamak [Phys. Rev. Lett. 59,1201 (1987)] indicate that the scattering effect becomes important inthe edge region as the fluctuation level is increased from 1% to 30%.Also, it is found that at the power levels currently being used in theexperiments, large ponderomotive modifications in the plasma densityare produced in the near zone of the launcher. In the weak nonlinearitylimit, the ion-Bernstein wave is found to be modulationally unstable,thus implying the possibility of localized heating.</TEXT></DOC>
