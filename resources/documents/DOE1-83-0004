A silica saturated liquid silicate-sulfatesolution is formed from Illinois No. 6 coal under oxidizing conditionsand, under some nonequilibrium conditions, is table to temperatures lowerthan at equilibrium. The liquid phase is an important factor in ash agglomeration,and the nonequilibrium aspects of its formation will require carefulexamination in coupled experimental-calculational studies in order tofully define the chemistry, the tendency to agglomerate, and the corrosivityof combustion products.</TEXT></DOC>
