The Palestinian youngster, the second reportedly shot bysettlers in the last three days, was hospitalized in fair condition.   In the West Bank town of El Bireh, the Israeli-appointed mayorsaid he was withdrawing his resignation after being asked to do soby the military government.   Hassan Tawil, 72, resigned Saturday after arsonists set the doorof his house on fire. He also had been stabbed and wounded in thechest by a Palestinian on June 7.   Pro-PLO leaders of the 14-month-old Palestinian uprising haverepeatedly urged Israeli-appointed officials to resign. At least 40Palestinians alleged to have collaborated with Israel are among theArab victims of the uprising.   The violence, which began in Dec. 1987, has killed 456Palestinians and 18 Israelis.   The increasing tensions between Palestinians and settlers in theoccupied territories was debated Sunday by the Cabinet. DefenseMinister Yitzhak Rabin rejected calls that settlers be allowedfreer use of firearms.   But Rabin also warned the army may have to take harsher measuresagainst Palestinians unless they accept Prime Minister YitzhakShamir's offer of elections in the occupied territories as a steptoward ending the uprising.   ``Whoever will oppose the idea of elections ... will force us torealize that there's no chance to sit around the negotiating table.Therefore we will have to use more force to put down the violencein the territories,'' Rabin told reporters.   Avner Shaki of the National Religious Party, a Cabinet ministerwithout portfolio, and Transport Minister Moshe Katzav of Shamir'sright-wing Likud bloc demanded that settlers be allowed to fireweapons whenever they are the target of stonings.   ``A rock should be seen as a weapon, like a firebomb, a knife, abullet or a bomb. The people of the uprising see rocks as a way ofclearing us out,'' of the occupied territories, Shaki told Israeltelevision. He proposed that Israel create a ``settler police.''   But Rabin and other ministers rejected changing self-defenserules, which allow settlers to fire at stone-throwers only inlife-threatening situations.   ``They have all the right to defend themselves ... but theydon't have and will not have responsibility for imposing law andorder in the territories,'' Rabin said.   The Cabinet debate followed the arrest Saturday of a 52-year-oldJewish settler from Kiryat Arba in the West Bank in the fatalshooting of a 14-year-old Palestinian boy in nearby Hebron.   The settler, Chaim Ben-Lulu, said he fired into the air Fridayto free himself from several dozen Arab youths who ambushed his carwith stones, Israeli news reports said.   Ben-Lulu, brought to Hebron Sunday to re-enact the shooting, wasstoned again, along with police and troops, Israel radio said. Itsaid soldiers fired in the air to disperse the Palestinians.   Also in Hebron, a settler whose car was being stoned shot10-year-old Arij Adnan Natshe in the head, Arab reports said. Thearmy said it was checking the report.   The girl was in fair condition at Hebron's Ahli Hospital, anofficial there said, adding that the girl appeared to have beenshot from a distance of 200 yards.   During the night, settlers demonstrated in front of militarygovernment headquarters in Hebron to protest increased stoningattacks.   About 70,000 Jewish settlers live among the 1.7 millionPalestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Also Sunday, an Arab Israeli doctor reportedly involved in talkswith Palestinians said Israel may free some Palestinian prisonersin exchange for an Israeli soldier's body.   Dr. Ahmed Tibi said in a telephone interview, ``From thePalestinian side, there is one body. Israel has to exchangesomething for this body and will do so, I think.''   He declined to give details, but the Israeli newspaper YediotAhronot said the body was that of Samir Assad, a Druse sergeantcaptured in April 1983 in south Lebanon.   Rabin denied the report, and an army spokesman refused comment.</TEXT></DOC>
