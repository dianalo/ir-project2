(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker says his faith willpull him through the hard times, including the $52 million lawsuitfiled against him by the ministry he left in disgrace afteradmitting to a sexual encounter.   ``After two years of what I've been going through, nothing ishumbling. My faith is in God. I believe God will bring me throughall of these things,'' Bakker said today as he left U.S. BankruptcyCourt.   PTL's lawsuit claims Bakker, his wife, Tammy, and former topaide David Taggart mismanaged the ministry and used PTL funds fortheir personal gain. The ministry entered bankruptcy protection in1987.   PTL attorneys presented their side of the argument during thefirst week of the trial before Judge Rufus Reynolds in September.The trial resumed Monday with the defense and ended today.   Reynolds did not issue an immediate verdict. The attorneys haveuntil Oct. 27 to submit further information or pleas. He then willpresent his draft findings within 10 days.   The attorneys will have another 10 days to submit theirresponses, after which Reynolds will issue a verdict.   In testimony Wednesday, Bakker said he wants his PTL documentsand a chance to prove he didn't abuse the TV ministry's funds.   ``I'm pleading for my documents,'' he said. ``I just want a fairshot. We're doing it piece by piece, but we're doing it.''   Bakker said many records are scattered among a federal grandjury in Charlotte, N.C., PTL offices and bankruptcy court.   For more than a year, the grand jury has been investigatingwhether the ministry raised money for one purpose and used it foranother.   During cross-examination today, PTL attorney Brad Leggett askedBakker if expenditures such as $900 for a shirt and trousers for amusic director and cash tips of as much as $600 were customary atPTL.   ``I have no idea. I simply don't know,'' Bakker replied.   Leggett also cross-examined Bakker on how much time he actuallyspent on his duties at PTL and the Heritage USA theme park nearFort Mill.   ``I spent my entire day working for the ministry of HeritageVillage Church. I spent whatever time was necessary,'' Bakker said.   The defense was preparing to rest its case later today.   On Wednesday, Bakker's attorney, Ryan Hovis, presented minutesfrom PTL board meetings and other documents showing Bakkerreimbursed the ministry for thousands of dollars in cash advances.   ``I have always ordered that any cash advance for me personallywas always paid back 100 percent,'' Bakker testified.   Hovis presented minutes from a September 1981 meeting showingthat the board had then granted Bakker a salary of $102,000; thatthe church was to be responsible for the upkeep of the parsonageand for utilities; and that the parsonage was to be turned over toBakker upon his retirement.   In other testimony, independent financial analyst James Wilsonretook the stand Wednesday, suggesting that Bakker was underpaidfor the number of responsibilities he held at the Heritage USAChristian retreat near Fort Mill.   The ministry entered bankruptcy protection three months afterBakker left in March 1987 when he admitted to a sexual encounterwith former church secretary Jessica Hahn.   When asked by Hovis whether he authorized any payment to Ms.Hahn, Bakker replied, ``I did not.'' He added, ``But I knew we werebeing blackmailed and I take full responsibility.''   Under cross-examination Wednesday by Leggett, Bakker said healso ``did not instruct any member of my staff not to make apayment'' to Ms. Hahn.   An IRS report lists a number of objects that Bakker had receivedthrough PTL for his personal benefit beyond reasonable compensation.   But Bakker said he bought a houseboat, an unfinished, 300-footwater slide and two Rolls Royces out of his own money. He said hedonated those and other items to PTL.   ``I had in regular practice given back to the ministry. Part ofChristianity is giving,'' he said. ``The Heritage Village Churchhas never, ever purchased a Rolls Royce for me or my family.''   The ministry presented testimony and evidence in the first weekof the trial in September that the Bakkers received about $9.5million in bonuses, salaries and other compensation from 1983 to1987.</TEXT></DOC>
