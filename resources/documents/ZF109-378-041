Afteracquiring Computervision Corp. and fighting a hostile takeover attempt by MAIBasic Four Inc., Prime has celebrated its first year as a subsidiary of DRHoldings Inc., a company formed by New York City-based J.H.andP;  Whitney andamp; Co. tomanage its leveraged buyout of Prime.andM;The company doesn't have much to celebrate.andP;  In its first year under newownership, Prime announced few new products and shows little sign of speedingproduct introductions anytime soon.andP;  And its onerous financial problemshaven't abated.andM;Users of the 23,000 Prime 50 series minicomputer systems currently installedworldwide show lingering uncertainty about the future of their principalvendor.andP;  Says john Finegan, MIS manager for CBIS Federal, a subsidiary ofCincinnati Bell Information Systems, &quot;I still think it [Prime] is on the waydown.andP;  I don't think it's hit bottom yet.&quot;andM;Users and analysts alike base their confidence in a company partially on itsability to develop and ship new products on a consistent schedule.andP;  That'sbeen a problem for Prime, which introduced only one new system for the 50series, the 2850 low-end supermini, in 1989.andP;  Early this year it rolled outtwo high-end machines, the 6450 and 6650.andP;  Nothing new has appeared since.andM;In an effort to prove to skittish customers that the company is indeeddeveloping new products, Prime unveiled the prototype of a new machine at theNational Prime User Group (NPUG) annual meeting in Orlando early this summer.andO;The new model is based on complementary metal oxide semiconductor  Cmos)technology.andM;Prime hasn't made a major change in underlying technology since 1984, whenthe company shifted from transistor-transistor logic (TTL) circuits toemitter-coupled logic (ECL) circuits.andP;  The prototype promises 50 series userssome attractive improvements.andP;  The box is quieter, smaller, more powerful andcheaper to run than the firm's existing ECL-based products.andP;  Plans call foreventually converting the entire 50 series line to the newer technology.andM;In introducing the prototype, Prime broke with its long-standing policy ofnot announcing new products until they are ready to ship.andP;  Richard Snyder,head of Prime's Computer Systems Business Unit, is candid about the reasonsfor the decision to display the new 50 series midrange computer so early inits development cycle.andP;  &quot;People are skeptical by nature,&quot; he says, addingthat action, not rhetoric will convert skeptics into believers.andM;Unfortunately for Prime, users like Finegan don't view the prototypeunveiling-or Prime's announcement of eventual plans-as anything more thanrhetoric.andP;  Mimicking Snyder's statement, Finengan sys, &quot;It really takesaction more than words for me.&quot;andM;Finegan and the rest of Prime's 14,000 50 series customers may have to waituntil next winter for real action on the new product front.andP;  Prime won'tformally release the new CMOS-based computer until the third quarter of 1990.andO;Traditionally, Prime has taken up to one quarter to ship new products afterannouncing them.andM;One reason behind the slow pace of development is Prime's shaky financialfooting.andP;  In 1989, the firm's losses totaled $276 million, making Prime thefourth largest loser among the world's biggest information technologycompanies.andP;  A year ago, when J.H.andP;  Whitney acquired 79% of Prime's commonstock-about 49.5 million shares-it paid $20 per share.andP;  The buyout washeavily leveraged.andP;  Prime's capital structure includes about $1 billion indebts.andP;  Interest on outstanding loans runs $32 million each quarter.andP;  Thosefigures worry users like jeff Koch, manager of project support engineering atNEC America Inc. &quot;My upper management is concerned about where Prime isgoing,&quot; he says.andP;  The Melville, N.Y., telecommunications firm uses systemsfrom its parent company NEC Corp. and from Digital Equipment Corp., Prime andSun Microsystems Inc. &quot; Prime is the most apt to get targeted for goingaway,&quot; Koch says.andM;Prime needs to turn such thinking around in a hurry.andP;  Anxiety among the userbase translates into delayed purchase decisions.andP;  &quot;We can continue for thenext couple of years with our existing systems,&quot; Koch says.andP;  &quot;We'll observePrime.andP;  In the meantime, we'll slowly change a couple of areas where we'redependent on Prime.&quot;andM;The problem of course is that Prime needs cash now, not somewhere down theroad.andP;  The company needs funds not only to retire its debt but to pay for theresearch and development that will ease the minds of users like Koch.andP;  Overthe next three years, Prime plans to spend $460 million on Randamp;D, about 16% ofits estimated product revenues.andP;  The Prime RateandM;While users fret over the computer giant's health, Prime is playing down theseriousness of its financial problems.andP;  In his first formal address tocustomers, new president John J.(Jack) Shields maintained to NPUGparticipants that Prime is fiscally sound.andP;  The argument behind that simplestatement is complex, he maintains, and it may take a while to sell the ideathat Prime is financially secure.andM;Shields, who presented the NPUG keynote address, devoted most of his speechto explaining Prime's complicated capital structure.andP;  In anticipation of aneventual public stock offering, Shields reported, DR Holdings is writing downthe value of goodwill so that any shares traded would more closely reflecttangible assets.andP;  In a leveraged buyout, the seller tries to drive up thevalue of goodwill, i.e., the value of such intangibles as a company'sreputation.andP;  Shields chalks up Prime's losses to DR Holdings' efforts towrite down that value.andM;The upshot, Shields says, is that when the write-down of goodwill, interestand taxes is excluded from the tally sheet, the picture looks good.andP;  Whenexpenses and revenues from operations are considered separately, Prime isprofitable.andP;  Although Prime posted a $ 1 01 million loss for the finalquarter in 1989, operating earnings before depreciation and amortizationtotaled 49.3 million, or about 1.6 times the $32 million cash interest duethat quarter.andM;NPUG president John Steffen of Chicago-based John Steffen says the usergroup's management is reassured by Shield's explanation about the company'sfinancial status.andP;  &quot;I'm not concerned.andP;  As an operating company, PrimeComputer made a profit.andP;  The paper loss doesn't mean a lot to us,&quot; he says.andO;Years of ChaosandM;Prime's financial troubles date back to 1985, when then-president Joe M.andO;Henson announced a goal to reach $2 billion in revenues by 1990.andP;  Prime hadbeen * PRIME BROKE WITH ITS POLICY OF NOT ANNOUNCING PRODUCTS UNTIL THEY AREREADY.andP;  growing by acquisition since 1981, and it stepped up plans to acquirecompanies that could help it reach that $2 billion mark.andP;  Its hostiletakeover of Computervision, completed in February 1988, was traumatic butsuccessful, boosting the company to No.andP;  2 behind IBM in the computer-aideddesign and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) market.andP;  Years of acquisitions and growthbrought Prime revenues of $1.59 billion by 1988 but left the firm cash poor.andO;No longer could Prime acquire other companies without looking like a takeovercandidate itself.andP;  In March 1988, it became clear that MAI Basic Four ofTustin, Calif., would attempt its own hostile takeover of the then-vulnerablePrime.andM;Henson laid off 10% of the work force-about 1,200 people.andP;  He alsorestructured the firm into three independent geographic business units: theAmericas; Europe and the Middle East; and the Far East.andP;  Despite theseefforts, the company was unable to fight off the hostile takeover alone.andO;Early in 1989, Prime leaked its desire for a white knight that would investin the firm without selling off profitable business units, as MAI Basic Fourwas expected to do.andP;  In August 1989, J.H.andP;  Whitney pranced in.andP;  In October1988, while Prime was fighting the takeover attempt, Henson resigned; AnthonyL. Craig took over as president and chief executive officer.andP;  Craig servedonly until J.H.andP;  Whitney's leveraged buyout took place, when the companynamed James F. McDonald, former head of Gould Inc. of Rolling Meadows, Ill.,andO;as Prime's new CEO.andP;  McDonald quickly made changes.andP;  Two months after hisappointment, he announced a restructuring plan that again included layoffs.andO;This time, about 2,500 people, or 20% of the original work force were let go.andO;Then Prime once again restructured, breaking into five independent businessunits, each responsible for its own profit and loss.andP;  The result has beengreater accountability.andM;Unfortunately, fighting MAI Basic Four took its toll on the business in theform of the sluggish rate of product development.andP;  Prime executives devotedat least as much attention to the battle as they did to running the business.andO;&quot;It's incalculable how much time we spent on that,&quot; Snyder laments.andP;  &quot;We losta year.&quot; The Presidential ShieldandM;More change was to come.andP;  In january 1990, Prime installed its thirdpresident in two years when J. H. Whitney brought in Jack Shields as Prime'snew president.andP;  Shields, who spent 28 years at Digital, was instrumental inthe Maynard, Mass., computer maker's evolution from startup to its presentstatus as the world's second largest computer manufacturer.andM;Even users who are most concerned about Prime's future see Shields as asignificant addition to the company.andP;  Before leaving Digital in October f989,Shields had been vice president of worldwide sales and service, withresponsibility for 70,000 employees.andP;  Shields, who some say left Digital overa dispute with CEO Kenneth H. Olsen over how to run the company in the faceof declining profits, was at one time considered next in line for Olsen'spost.andP;  After a year at Prime, Shields will become Prime's CEO.andP;  On Shields'arrival, McDonald became vice chairman of Prime's board of directors.andM;At this year's NPUG meeting, Shields spent an evening circulating among the800 users who made the trek to Florida.andP;  For at least some users, Shieids'informal chats at the exhibition hall were as reassuring as his formalspeech.andP;  Users see him as a personable, accessible top executive.andP;  &quot;He seemsapproachable,&quot; says Kina Leitner, director of MIS for New York University LawSchool in Manhattan.andP;  Leitner, who heads the user organization's specialinterest group for Information, Prime's popular PICK-based relationaldatabase management system, believes Shields was a hit.andP;  Valiant StruggleRegardless of any popularity Shields might enjoy, Prime still faces aformidable public relations problem.andP;  The combination of Prime's reportedlosses and the negative attention leveraged buyouts and junk bond financinghave received over the last year has hurt the company's image more than topexecutives expected.andP;  The public's focus on the bottom Fine and theintricacies of the buyout caught Prime by surprise, Snyder says.andP;  &quot;Because wewent private, we thought no one would pay attention,&quot; he explains.andP;  Thepressures of a sizable debt are making an already difficult situation worse.andO;Like other minicomputer companies, Prime is struggling to adapt to changessweeping the industry-the trend toward open systems, powerful workstationsand local area networks.andP;  Like its Massachusetts neighbors Wang LaboratoriesInc. and Data General Corp., Prime is trying to redefine its business to meetchallenges those changes bring.andP;  &quot;It's the old proverb of trying to turn alarge boat around on a dime.andP;  You just * IN THE MIDRANGE, PRIME CAN'T AFFORDTo BE THE SAME INNOVATOR IT ONCE WAS.andP;  don't do it very easily,&quot; says WayneKernochan, senior analyst for distributed systems at The Yankee Group, aBoston-based consulting firm.andP;  Kernochan applauds Prime's efforts in the faceof its many challenges.andP;  &quot;I don't want to paint too bleak a picture,&quot; hesays.andP;  &quot;They've been under tough constraints, and they've done a good job inspite of it.&quot; Apparently, Prime considers its problems to be those of image,not substance.andP;  For instance, one thing Shield promises to bring to Prime isa new corporate culture, where the highest priority is placed on customersatisfaction and quality.andP;  &quot;That's the kind of stuff you hear from time totime,&quot; says CBIS Federal's Finegan.andP;  &quot;It reminds me of other companies, wheresomebody wants to be minister of culture instead of running their business.&quot;andM;Finegan is among the class of Prime's customers that is likely to feel themost anxiety.andP;  He uses 50 series systems exclusively to run his company'scommercial Is applications.andP;  Finegan, like other observers, sees Primefocusing on UNIX, the CAD/CAM market and its Information database managementsystem.andP;  For installed commercial systems like mine, I don't see the samelevel of concern,&quot; Finegan says.andP;  &quot;The service I receive has deterioratedsince the takeover.&quot; Seeing is BelievingandM;Shields is also promising the sort of enhancements to the 50 series thatshould please commercial users-improved delivery times and quicker crashrecovery, for example.andP;  Finegan remains unconvinced.andP;  'For example, they'veannounced a plan to speed delivery of parts.andP;  When I get my first disk driveon time, without someone going out and butchering another machine to get it,that will give me some confidence.&quot;andM;Despite continued assurances from Prime, concerns about support for itstraditional minicomputer line date back at least to 1988, when Prime acquiredComputervision.andP;  The importance of CAD/ CAM to Prime's future is growing.andO;Following the acquisition, CAD/CAM accounted for 19% of Prime's revenues.andO;Last year, it grew to 32% of total revenues.andP;  In the international arena,where Prime rakes in 60% of all its revenues, CAD/CAM is even more important,accounting for 42% of revenue.andM;Emphasis on computer-aided design is just good business, considering theproblems Prime has faced, says Yankee Group's Kernochan.andP;  &quot;In the midrange,they can't afford to be the same innovators they once were.andP;  On the CAD/CAMside, on the other hand, they look reasonably well fed,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;That's acoherent long-term strategy.&quot; Swimming Open Systems SeasandM;One of Prime's biggest challenges is finding a way to compete in the opensystems market, says Rich Schreiber, vice president of systems research atInternational Data Corp. of Framingham, Mass.andP;  It's going to be difficult forprime to differentiate itself from other UNIX vendors, Schreiber believes.andM;Prime has floundered in the UNIX market.andP;  Its EXL series of Intel 80386-basedUNIX-based computers has failed to gain significant market share.andP;  Prime'sSnyder agrees that EXL sales have been disappointing because the companyfailed to distinguish the machine.andP;  But a new strategy has emerged from thatdifficult lesson, he says.andM;Today Prime is pinning its hopes on what Snyder sees as an inevitablemigration of PICK users to UNIX, a charge Snyder believes Prime is wellpositioned to lead.andP;  Its Information package is one of Prime's mostsuccessful offerings; about 40% of all 50 series users run it.andP;  In june,Prime announced a version of the software that runs with ATandamp;T's UNIXoperating system.andP;  It meets some immediate needs of Prime customers,particularly in the CAD/CAM arena, where there's a need to link Informationapplications to UNIX workstations.andM;Prime is hoping to attract new customers with its UNIX strategy, which willinclude some new machines as well, Snyder says.andP;  Although Prime can't win the&quot;Best of Show&quot; prize, Snyder adds, &quot;we can be best of breed.andP;  &quot;andM;They are wisely putting their Randamp;D into UNIX and the UNIX environment,&quot; saysSchreiber.andP;  Now Prime needs to convince users, particularly those outside theCAD/CAM market, that the company's UNIX plans and other strategies will meettheir needs.andM;It's not that Prime lacks direction.andP;  As the company leaves the raidersbehind and returns to the business of supplying information technology, itappears to have a clear grasp of the obstacles it faces.andP;  &quot;They know whatthey need to do,&quot; says Schreiber.andM;The question remaining is whether it can implement new strategies fast enoughto satisfy existing customers and in ways innovative enough to attract newusers.andM;Prime TimeandM;Here is a snapshot of Prime'sandM;business in its first year as a DRandM;Holdings subsidiary.andM;1989 Revenue: $1.52 billionandM;1989 Losses: $276.8 millionandM;DATAMATION 100 Ranking: 39andM;Fortune 500 Ranking: 259andM;Employees: 10,670andM;Prime Gets on TrackandM;Prime's independent business unitsandM;power the company.andM;Computervision Business UnitandM;Responsibility: CAD/CAM product line,andM;including CADSS, MEDUSA and CalmaandM;software packagesandM;Percentage of U.S.andP;
