McCANN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Motorola Inc. has filed a lawsuit charging thatHitachi Ltd. has infringed on several of the U.S. company's patentsand is engaging in unfair competition in the sale of microprocessors.   In the lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court, Motorolaaccuses Tokyo-based Hitachi of engaging in unfair competition withits new H-8 microprocessor.   Also named in the lawsuit are Hitachi America Ltd. of Itasca,Ill., and Nissei Sangyo America Ltd. of Rolling Meadows, Ill., bothdistributors of Hitachi products.   ``Hitachi America is greatly surprised at this action byMotorola,'' spokesman Sam Nishikawa said. ``Until Hitachi Americahas had an opportunity to review the complaint, we are unable tocomment on this matter.''   A hearing was scheduled for today on Motorola's request for aninjunction halting sales of the microprocessor. The lawsuit alsoasks for monetary damages to be determined by the court.   Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., says the unfair competitionbegan shortly after Motorola granted a patent license to Hitachi forcertain Motorola microprocessors in May 1986.   The company says the Hitachi H-8 microprocessor series infringeson at least four Motorola patents.   The microprocessor is a digital electronic device that performsthe control and arithmetic functions of a computer.   Motorola says its patent license and related technologyagreements with Hitachi specifically limit the use of Motorola'sconfidential and proprietary information on the MC6800-68000families of microprocessors.   Despite the limits, Hitachi introduced its Zero Turn-Around Timemicroprocessors in 1986, using Motorola technology that was excludedfrom agreements between the companies, Motorola said.   Motorola spokesman Tim Kellogg said his company had been innegotiations with Hitachi since October in an effort to stop salesof the H-8 microprocessor.   ``We have had patent licenses with Hitachi for more than 10years,'' Kellogg said. ``This is the first time we have had to suethem.''   In 1983 Hitachi, one of Japan's largest makers of computers,electronic circuits and consumer electronic products, agreed to payInternational Business Machines Corp. between $2 million and $4million a month for eight years.   Hitachi agreed to the payments to settle an IBM lawsuit thatcharged Hitachi with using computer software that too closelyresembled software copyrighted by IBM. Hitachi did not admit to anyguilt in the agreement.   Also in 1983, Hitachi pleaded guilty to federal charges ofattempting to obtain and transport stolen IBM computer materials toJapan. It paid the maximum fine of $10,000.   The Motorola lawsuit claims that Hitachi used Motorola'sexclusive proprietary technology to coerce Motorola into extendingadditional patent license rights to Hitachi.</TEXT></DOC>
