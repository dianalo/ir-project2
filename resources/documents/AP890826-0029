The secretary-general of the Organization of American States,Joao Clemente Baena Soares of Brazil, and U.N. Secretary-GeneralJavier Perez de Cuellar announced Friday that work will begin Sept.6.   Perez de Cuellar met with Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Migueld'Escoto Brockmann to discuss resettling the estimated 11,000 to12,000 Nicaraguan rebels, now based in Honduras.   Upon learning that dates had been fixed for the demobilization ofthe Contras, d'Escoto said: ``That is very good news; we have wantedthat for a very long time.   ``I would imagine that the vast majority of the people would wantto come home. Even some of the Miami contras have returned,'' saidd'Escoto.   Under an agreement signed Aug. 7 by the presidents of Nicaragua,El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala, the U.S.-supportedContras are to repatriated or resettled in other countries.   The Tela Declaration calls for the rebels to be resettled by Dec.5.   Numerous Contra field commanders and guerrillas have said theywill not give up their fight.   However, a U.N. diplomat active in Central American affairs saidpreliminary talks with the rebels indicate they are quite willing togo home or be resettled, and that little resistance is expected.   Disarming and resettling the Contras will require a new U.N.peacekeeping force, said the diplomat, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   The world body's experts believe the size and cost of such aforce can be minimized if the Contras are disarmed over a period ofmonths in small groups, rather than rounded up and disarmed at once,he said.   The United States had lobbied the Central American nations toallow the Contras to stay in their border camps in Honduras untilnational elections are held in Nicaragua on Feb. 25, to maintainpressure on the Sandinistas to allow a fair campaign.   Even Honduras, however, which has received lavish military andforeign aid from Washington, agreed earlier this month that therewas no justification to allow the Contras to remain until then.   The United States gives the Contras $4.5 million a month innon-lethal aid, which may also be used for resettlement.   Congress cut off money for weapons last year. The Contras laternegotiated a truce with the Sandinistas and since then have launchedonly sporadic raids.   Perez de Cuellar also met Friday with El Salvador's foreignminister, Jose Manuel Pacas Castro.   El Salvador wants its Central American neighbors to turn theirattention on disbanding the leftist rebel force trying to topple itsgovernment, a goal the U.S. government shares.   The joint U.N.-OAS statement alluded to that aim by sayingefforts will be made to disband and resettle ``all those involved inarmed actions in the countries of the region when they voluntarilyseek it.''   The Salvadoran rebels are the Faribundo Marti Liberation Front,known by its Spanish acronym as the FMLN.</TEXT></DOC>
