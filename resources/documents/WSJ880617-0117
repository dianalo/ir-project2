They'll know better if President Reagan signs the catastrophic-health bill that the lobbying group just rammed through Congress. The bill is a massive tax increase on Americans over 65. The new tax will pay for extended medical care that 90% of them already get from private insurance, former employers or Medicaid.    This soak-the-elderly-rich expansion of Medicare will start big and get huge. The Treasury says the catastrophic program will cost $1.3 billion next year, $12 billion in 1992 and $17 billion in 1995. To pay for all this, there will be a &quot;supplemental premium&quot; -- a tax based on a beneficiary's wealth as measured by his income-tax liability. This will introduce direct redistribution of wealth into a welfare program.    The proposed new Medicare premiums are enough to cause fibrillations in the healthiest 65-year-olds. The new rates apply to those eligible for Medicare who pay at least $150 a year in income taxes, which is nearly half the people over 65. Beginning next year, this will hit those who make as little as $6,000.    For 1989, the additional Medicare payment will be $22.50 per $150 of taxes, with a cap of $800 per person. The couple who pay an extra $1,600 next year will pay an extra $2,100 a year by 1993. The Treasury estimates that by 2005, couples will pay closer to $8,000 a year.    Put another way, next year the elderly will pay a staggering 15% surcharge on their income taxes. By 1993, this rate will nearly double, to a 28% surcharge.    This income-based premium is supposed to pay for two-thirds of the cost of the catastrophic coverage. The other third will come from increases in a flat surcharge. Everyone eligible for Medicare will pay a flat premium increase of $4 a month next year in addition to the current $24.80 a month. The flat premium will rise to more than $10 a month by 1993.    What wonderful benefits will the elderly get for all this? Nothing that many don't already have. As to the rest, the price of federal coverage will exceed what it would cost for private insurance. The bill doesn't include long-term home care, which even the House just voted down despite the best efforts of Claude Pepper. Instead, the program expands coverage of long-term hospital stays, nursing-home and hospice care. There is also a prescription-drug program that essentially turns the pharmaceutical industry into a government subsidiary by funneling federal dollars toward unlimited drug prescriptions. Not coincidentally, AARP itself has a huge drug-dispensing operation, and comes out a big winner under the bill.    If you think these premiums bash the elderly, just wait. Removing the price mechanism from big-ticket health items will drive up demand to unknowable levels. The Congressional Budget Office assures that the higher premiums will cover the costs. But an internal report from the Office of Management and Budget casts doubt on this sanguine view. In 1992, OMB estimates, the program will cost $2.4 billion more than the premiums bring in. Premiums would have to skyrocket, or the program would require funding from the general budget. Past experience with federal entitlements suggests that OMB's prediction is closer to the mark.    HHS Secretary Otis Bowen's bright idea back in 1986 to become the driver of the liberals' catastrophic-health bandwagon puts the White House in a tough spot. Faced with signing this bill, President Reagan must soon choose between the elderly and the AARP. He should veto this catastrophic tax. </TEXT></DOC>
