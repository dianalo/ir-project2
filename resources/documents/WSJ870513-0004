The trade group said it will begin immediately to recruit members for the consortium and raise $125 million by assessing consortium members about 1% of their semiconductor sales. The group said it also plans to seek about $125 million from the U.S. government for the effort, which is intended to help the U.S. regain its edge in state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing techniques.    Charles E. Sporck, chairman and chief executive officer of National Semiconductor Corp. and chairman of the consortium's steering committee, said the consortium, called Sematech, probably will attract 20 to 30 companies, including many of the country's largest chip makers. But, he said, the project won't succeed unless the government agrees to pick up half the tab.    &quot;That's what this consortium needs to have the kind of impact it requires,&quot; he said. &quot;If the funding doesn't materialize, and we believe it will, then the plan will have to be substantially changed.&quot;    Currently, the plan calls for the government's financial commitment to last a maximum of six years. The group said it hopes to have company commitments by September.    In Washington, several officials and scientists involved with various government deliberations on the U.S. semiconductor industry said they aren't convinced that a federally funded consortium is the answer to the industry's competitiveness problems. These sources said the industry still hasn't proven that such a consortium would be more than a short-term government handout, or that the consortium would help the industry fend off long-term foreign competition.    One Pentagon official, for example, called a previously reported recommendation for a chip consortium issued by the Defense Science Board, an advisory committee to the secretary of defense, &quot;badly structured&quot; and irrelevant to the industry's main problems. The official said studies on the U.S. chip industry, including the Pentagon committee's report, have shown that the industry's most serious problems are its &quot;structural&quot; weaknesses compared with its competitors, especially Japan. Such weaknesses include the higher cost of capital in the U.S., less-patient shareholders and a less-stable work force.    &quot;The committee's report was disappointing because the conclusion to come to Uncle Sugar didn't measure up to the analysis inside the report,&quot; the official said.    Moreover, in January, when the Semiconductor Industry Association presented an early version of its consortium proposal to the White House Science Council, William R. Graham, the president's science adviser, grilled industry representatives on their data, according to a participant in the meeting. &quot;Those guys kept coming on strong for government help, and Graham kept asking, `Where's your data?' &quot; the participant said. &quot;The rest {of the council} listened skeptically.&quot;    Added Edward David, a consultant and chairman of the White House Science Council's working committee on semiconductors: &quot;The case hasn't yet been made that Sematech or something like it would prevent the U.S. from becoming more dependent on foreign chip suppliers. We've seen a lot of arm-waving, but nothing definite.&quot;    As previously reported, the Semiconductor Industry Association's board agreed in March to create a research consortium that would attempt to come up with better ways to make semiconductors, the tiny chips that make most electronic products work. As planned, the consortium would develop semiconductor technologies on a small scale before turning them over to member companies for large-scale production.    The semiconductor association's board, which represents companies such as Harris Corp., International Business Machines Corp., Texas Instruments Inc. and Intel Corp., have agreed to provide &quot;a few million&quot; dollars in funding to get the project going, Mr. Sporck said. Many of the 13 companies represented on the board are expected to join the consortium.    Mr. Sporck and other board members declined to say what kinds of semiconductors the consortium might produce, saying that the emphasis will be on manufacturing techniques rather than products.    The trade group also said it will soon begin a search for a chief executive officer, who will work with member companies and the government, and a chief operating officer. It also hopes to choose a site by September and begin producing semiconductors by late 1988. The consortium could eventually employ 700 to 800 people.    ---   Peter Waldman in San Francisco contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
