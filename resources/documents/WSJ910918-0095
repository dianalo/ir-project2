It signals that Swedish voters finally aretiring of something the world's left has long praised, the&quot;Swedish model&quot; of socialism.   Until Sunday, Swedish socialism had succeeded both on itsown terms -- as an experiment in massive incomeredistribution -- and at the ballot box. Swedish voters hadkept the socialists in power for 53 of the past 59 years. Thekey was the party's willingness to leave the private sectorlargely unmolested. The wealth it created was taxed away tofinance an elaborate welfare state.</LP><TEXT>   But by the mid-1980s, even the Swedish model had sprungleaks. A nanny government, looking after the every need ofeight million men, women and children, began to require morerevenues than the economy could supply. Public expendituresnow consume over 57% of the nation's total output (GDP),compared with 34% in the U.S. and 25% in Japan.   By the end of the 1980s it was evident that the Swedishmodel was in serious trouble. The symptoms were slow growth,inflation and capital flight. Swedish workers were tired oflosing nearly 70% of their pay to taxes and social-insurancedeductions and were agitating for wage increases that theirproductivity in no way justified. Maternal governmentgratified some demands. But because the economy wasn't strongenough to finance both welfare and wages, double-digitinflation, not improved living standards, was the result.   On Sunday, a populist New Democracy Party won a surprising25 seats in Parliament by asserting that Swedes should &quot;havemore fun.&quot; Taxes should be slashed, the party said, to leaveSwedes enough extra cash to dine out once in awhile.   Sweden's other problem arose from an effort to gain accessto foreign investment and foreign capital markets by removingforeign exchange controls. Capital flowed out, not in, asinvestors fled the country's tax burdens. By opening a windowfor fresh air, a needed move, the government exposed thecountry's fundamental weakness.   It was the combination of inflation, pinched paychecks andindustrial decline that sent the socialists and theirpartners, the formerly communist Left Party, to defeatSunday. (The radical environmentalist Green Party was alsothrown out of Parliament for failing to clear the 4%threshold for representation.) But the winning coalition ofnonsocialist parties fell four seats short of an absolutemajority. They could overcome this by bringing the feisty NewDemocrats into their coalition, but the New Democrats are tooradical for some members.   Moderate Party leader Carl Bildt, who now will try to forma new government, once called the New Democrats a &quot;joke.&quot; Buthe and his partners in the Liberal Party should reconsider. Aparty that wins 25 seats can hardly be treated as a joke,particularly when its wish to cut taxes complements theeconomic program that Mr. Bildt and his allies areprofessing.   One thing is certain. Sweden won't be able to refloat the&quot;Swedish model&quot; in its old form. It's more evident than everthat socialist experiments will be unable to survive therigors of a more open and competitive world economy.</TEXT></DOC>
