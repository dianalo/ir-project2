Prices that producers charged for finished goods rose 0.4% in April and 0.6% in March, the department said. In the first five months of 1988, producer prices rose at a 3.2% annual rate, compared with a 2.2% increase for all of 1987.    &quot;You're not seeing a dramatic surge in inflation; it's kind of a creeping increase,&quot; said Donald Ratajczak, a Georgia State University economist.    Much of the May increase reflects a 0.9% surge in food prices. Excluding food and energy prices, which often swing widely from month to month, producer prices rose 0.3% following increases of 0.1% in April and 0.4% in March.    The wholesale price of processed chickens was up 8.2% in May after climbing 4.7% in April. Egg prices were up 12.5%, reversing a 16.3% decline in April. Vegetable prices were up 3.3% on top of a 2.1% rise in April. All the producer-price figures are adjusted for usual seasonal fluctuations.    &quot;I think we'll see another month of big food price increases next month,&quot; said Kathryn Kobey, an economist with Joel Popkin andamp; Co., a Washington economics consulting firm. &quot;The drought scare has run prices up somewhat. Barring a total drought, I don't think we'll see such big increases in food prices (in later months).&quot;    Much of the May rise in food prices reflects conditions in the poultry industry rather than the weather. William Roenigk, economist for the National Broiler Council, said chicken producers expanded their output less rapidly this year because they had suffered losses, yet demand for chicken among households and fast-food chains continues to grow. The result is higher prices, he said.    One bright spot in the May report was a 1.7% fall in the price of raw materials other than food and energy. This sensitive measure of commodity prices -- which tracks such things as cotton, iron ore and logs -- hadn't declined since August 1986.    The Labor Department said prices of intermediate -- or partly processed -- materials, supplies and parts were up 0.6% in May after climbing 0.8% in April and 0.6% in March. Excluding foods, intermediate goods prices rose 0.6% in May.    Prices for some industrial materials that have been in short supply continued to climb last month -- but at a slower rate. Industrial chemical prices were up 0.5% after climbing 1.8% in April and 4.4% in March. Paperboard prices rose 0.9% after rising 4.3% in April and 3.1% in March.    The prices of crude goods, or raw materials, were up a strong 1.3% in May. But a 2.3% increase in food prices accounted for most of the increase. The price of live chickens was up 12.8% in May after rising 4.4% in April and 13.4% in March. Hog prices, which fell in the two previous months, were up 7.4%.    Excluding food, prices of crude goods were up 0.3% in May; that compared with a 1.7% jump in April and a 1.3% decline in March.    Prices of U.S.-built capital equipment rose 0.4% in May following a 0.2% climb in April and a 0.4% increase in March. The department said price increases accelerated for X-ray and electromedical equipment, industrial material-handling equipment, oil and gas field machinery and mining machinery.    The producer price report doesn't measure prices of services or imports.    Here are the Labor Department's producer price indexes (1982=100) for May, before seasonal adjustment, and the percentage changes from May, 1987.
