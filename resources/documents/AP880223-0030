Officials of the Reagan administration confirmed Monday that theCommerce Department and Customs Service were investigating thepossibility that the computer supposedly destined for Yugoslaviawound up in Soviet Union.   ``We're concerned by this apparent diversion and are workingwith Yugoslav authorities to determine exactly what happened in thespecific case,'' said State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley.   According to a report in Monday's editions of the WashingtonTimes, a Los Angeles Company, Essex Marketing Co., is underinvestigation for an alleged shipment last December 21 of acomputer capable of simulating nuclear explosions to an engineeringcollege in Zagreb, Yugoslovia.   The newspaper said the computer was shipped to Moscow by way ofBelgrade, the Yugoslav capital, and East Berlin.   Donald Creed, a spokesman for the Commerce Department, saidgovernment investigators had uncovered ``an elaborate scheme todivert a high-technology computer.'' He said it was the first``diversion that we are aware of concerning Yugoslavia.''   He declined to discuss details of the case.   U.S. law prohibits export of items with possible militaryapplication to Soviet bloc nations. Other high-technology goods mayonly be shipped to those nations with approval of the Paris-basedCoordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or COCOM.   Disclosures last year that Toshiba Machine company of Japan hadexported high-technology submarine technology to the Soviets inviolation of COCOM regulations led to the filing of criminalcharges against some company officials in Tokyo and strongdenunciations of the sale from U.S. lawmakers.   Though communist, Yugoslavia is not officially aligned with theSoviet Union. High-technology shipments there do not require COCOMapproval.   Another Commerce Department official, speaking on the conditionof anonymity, said that the complete computer system was notshipped to the Soviet Union. ``There were some things that wereready to go in warehouses that were stopped,'' the official said.   The Washington Times said the computer, made by Floating PointSystems of Beaverton, Ore., can be used by military planners togauge the impact of nuclear explosions and to help determineoptimal targets for nuclear missiles.   The newspaper said that Floating Point was not a target of theinvestigation.   Ana Marija Besker, press counselor for the Yugoslav Embassy,said ``we have asked for a clarification from Belgrade on thisreport.''   ``But in any case, we are responsible partners in technologydeals,'' she said. ``Our laws on these matters are very strict.''   In 1986, the administration investigated an alleged attempt todivert large shipments of computers and other sensitive equipmentto the Soviet bloc through Austria.</TEXT></DOC>
