A certificate on the office wall proclaims Dunbar ``safe andsmiling'' _ a contrast to the experience of many of its pupilsduring their day off Tuesday.   The Spanish-design, pastel-peach building on Miami's NW 20th St.in the heart of the Overtown neighborhood seems an oasis in themiddle of the housing projects, rundown apartments and overgrownlots in the heart of the city.   After the first night of violence sparked by the police shootingof an unarmed black motorcyclist Monday, six schools were closed. OnWednesday, Dade County reopened schools, including Dunbar.   Nine-year-old Tiffany Dukes said Wednesday she sat on her porchand watched as her neighborhood smoldered with anger during her dayat home.   ``They was shooting in the air and they had caught some stores onfire,'' she said. ``They was burning cars in the street.''   This part of Overtown didn't look like a riot scene Wednesday,but a few signs gave it away. Broken glass littered the roadway nearthe school, a torched grocery store smoldered and two barricadesmarked the police perimeter five blocks away. Two policemen sat infront of the school, talking quietly.   The damage in Overtown was far worse in the 1982 riot, wheninjured people sought refuge in the Dunbar cafeteria, said 4th gradeteacher Walter Allen.   The school has been untouched this time.   Tiffany said she was happy to be back at school. When asked whatwas causing problems, Tiffany quickly referred to the deadmotorcyclist.   ``The police shot him for nothing,'' she said.   Tamika Facey, 11, said the rioting ``was so disgusting. We werereally scared.''   Sherelle Poole, also 11, said she ``felt bad about what washappening, about the disturbance. I was sad. I was scared.''   Attendance was low Wednesday at Dunbar, but teachers said parentsmay not have known schools were open again.   Five hundred children showed up, instead of the usual 1,200.   ``Five hundred kids,'' Principal Maybelline Truesdell said,laughing. ``This is heaven! I could love this .... but not underthese circumstances.   ``On the morning announcements I told them how happy we were tosee them. Then I told them that if they had any questions orconcerns, their teachers would discuss it with them,'' she said.   But she said none of the children had come forward to talk aboutany difficulties.   ``The parents have done an excellent job of explaining thesituation _ as much as it can be explained,'' she said.   Fourth-grader Marcine Hill, didn't seem to be greatly affected.   He said he spent Tuesday playing, ``but when the riot started Iwent in the house.''   Marcine, 10, lives on NW Third Avenue, near the heart of thedisturbance and some of the strongest efforts to quell it.   ``They threw tear gas,'' he said. ``We put on the fan and putplastic up in our bedroom windows.''   After that, he and his family watched the action on television.   When asked if he understood the unrest, he said ``Nope.''   Marcine said he'd missed being at Dunbar on Tuesday.   The principal asked him how he knew the neighborhood was involvedin a riot. ``They said it was a riot,'' he said, noting the police``had on helmets and bullet-proof vests.''   Coming back to the beautifully manicured school behind the barbedwire was a welcome change for Marcine from life in the neighborhood.   ``I was ready to get away from all that,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
