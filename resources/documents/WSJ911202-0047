But when she met Chuckie, she fell head over heelsin love.   With those deep soulful eyes, white button nose and cuddlyfur coat, Chuckie, a red-tailed guenon monkey, was Ms.Karron's dream-pet come true.</LP><TEXT>   Ms. Karron, of Fort Smith, Ark., went bananas. She notonly paid $10,000 for the three-month-old African monkey, butthen prepared for his arrival by wallpapering his room withanimal pictures and installing his own color television,complete with cable reception.   But Chuckie went ape. Riding home from the pet store, heripped off every button and knob in Ms. Karron's Mazda 626.He bit holes in the upholstery and swung from the rearviewmirror. Later, at home, Chuckie unlocked his room's doorwhile Ms. Karron, 32, was at work. He tore out telephones,broke dishes, squirted toothpaste and methodically smashedeggs from the refrigerator all about. Little was saved exceptthe purple monkey vitamins he won't touch. The lesson for Ms.Karron: &quot;Do the whole house in purple or get rid of him.&quot;   Thousands of people who are snapping up exotic babyanimals are learning the same lesson the hard way: Littlebundles of joy from the jungle grow up to be perfectly awfulpets. Yet many people aren't learning fast enough. Animaldealers in the U.S. legally imported 3.1 million birds,mammals and reptiles in 1989, the most recent figuresavailable. That's about one import for every three dogs andcats sold.   &quot;More and more people are sick of common pets. They wantsomething different,&quot; says Gordon Gallup, a psychologist atthe State University of New York who studies human attitudestoward animals.   Animal dealers pander to a market they recognize asselfish and silly. &quot;Some guys buy monkeys thinking they'llhelp get girls,&quot; says Randy Davies, an exotic pet dealer inCincinnati. Yvonne Allison, who raises macaws in Queen City,Texas, tells of a woman who bought a blue and gold specimento match her new living room suite. &quot;The bird was strictlyfurniture,&quot; says Mrs. Allison. The woman later sold the birdwhen it proved messy.   The exotic pets often suffer more than their masters. Whenthey grow up, many imported animals are abandoned. Hugeparrots and macaws from Central America now fightmockingbirds for food in parts of South Texas. A nonprofitsanctuary for unwanted pet primates near San Antonio, Texas,receives a half-dozen inquiries a week from people wanting tounload. &quot;People who want to get close to these animals shouldjust buy some binoculars, and watch the Nature Channel,&quot; saysWallace Swett, manager of the nonprofit shelter.   Let's look at a rogues' gallery of exotic animals thatoften become pets on sales pitches that turn out to havequite a curve.   Kinkajou (potos flavus) -- Looks like a small, stuffedraccoon. Huge, adorable eyes and humanish ears that tilt inthe direction of your goo-goo talk. At night, this SouthAmerican mammal fondly wraps its long tail around lamps andvases -- then yanks with the strength of a longshoreman. Alsonoted for its appealingly enigmatic expression when biting.Priced at $1,400.   Capuchin (cebus capucinus) -- Barefaced little monkey witha cute crown of hair. The ones leashed to old-world organgrinders. Beware when the music stops: Capuchins haverazor-sharp teeth and attack without warning. &quot;I've beenbitten by all five of mine,&quot; says one owner in Santa Fe,N.M., who asked for anonymity while she's trying to sell partof her brood. A capuchin stars in horror-film maker GeorgeRomero's 1988 &quot;Monkey Shines: An Experiment In Fear.&quot; About$2,700.   Oscar fish (astronotus ocellatus) -- The tiny redArgentine is just about the cutest thing in a finned friend;they seem to recognize their owners. So why are they beingreturned by the dozen to pet stores? &quot;They grow up to be theSouth American equivalent of our largemouth bass,&quot; says LarryMcShafry, a pet store owner in Houston. At maturity, their14-inch length cramps turnaround ability in a typicalaquarium. They also devour any smaller brethren withingulping range. Only $2.95.   Wallaby (wallabia lagorchestes) -- When young, thisAustralian marsupial resembles a skinny bouncing mouse. Butlater, at 30 pounds or so, it takes the form of its kangaroorelatives. Adept at relieving themselves while boomerangingoff beds and sofas. Their urine is essentially a red dye withunique staining power. Adventuresome eaters who sample toiletpaper. Wallabies grow big enough to bound through picturewindows. $2,000.   Conure (aratinga mitrata) -- Beautiful yellow and blueSouth American birds that can be tamed to human touch andgrow to a modest height of about eight inches. Priced at $50to $500, far less than a macaw or parrot. So what's wrong?They screech at dawn -- every dawn -- and often in theevening. Most conures never learn words, as many exotic birdsdo. They just screech at daybreak their wholelives-frequently 50 years.   Vietnamese Potbellied Pig (sus scrofa) -- Trendy porkerswho supposedly stay small and friendly and learn to use akitty-litter box. But some owners report the potbellies bitewith their big bicuspids and terrorize any cats in thehousehold. Worse, pet stores in short supply are turning tocrossbreeds that don't live up to potbelly billing. AnimalJungle, a pet shop in Virginia Beach, Va., marked down twopart-potbellies to $700 apiece from $1,800; the store finallyraffled off one and gave the other to a zoo. &quot;I can tell youthey never learned to use a litter box,&quot; says Dawn Johnson,who cleans pens at the store.   Caiman (caiman crocodilus) -- The baby reptiles resemblesmall crocodiles. Grownups look like four-foot-long crocs.Reputedly enjoys dozing off with you stroking its stomach.Your penalty for doing this wrong? Here's a hint: Caimans usetheir jaws to crush the shells of clams and snails. One manreturned his baby caiman to a Houston pet store recentlyafter it nipped him the first night home. &quot;He was quiteupset. He said it was like being stuck with needles,&quot; recallsthe store owner. The caiman was traded for an aquarium.Without a first-aid kit: $130.   Spider monkey (ateles geoffroyi) -- Named for its longlimbs and tail that allow it to grab several breakablehousehold items at once. Sold as babies wearing diapers byU.S. dealers for about $2,000, they seem harmless. But Mr.Davies, the monkey marketer, says Bo Bo, his personal spider,now a cranky 18-pounder, recently picked up a 25-pound cinderblock and chased a neighbor.   Despite the mayhem of exotic pets, many people just can'tresist them. Although Ms. Karron has placed Chuckie in ananimal shelter, where he resides in a large cage, she visitsfrequently, donates money and sweeps up. Feeding Chuckie asnack through the bars, she says, &quot;He's still the cutestanimal I've ever seen.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
