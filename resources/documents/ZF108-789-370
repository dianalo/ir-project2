LTE/20 and a Toshiba AmericaInformation Systems Inc.andP;  T1000SE -- and the Ethernet T-connector wasattached.andM;Installing the NetWare driver support software for each adapter was not aseasy.andP;  An IPX.COM file had to be generated for each PPNA.andP;  IPX.COM is thedriver that manages communications between whatever network adapter is usedin a workstation and NetWare as it runs on a network.andP;  The NetWare SHGENprogram creates an IPX file for a given adapter, using special files suppliedby the adapter manufacturer.andP;  SHGEN is not easy to use, especially forsomeone not familiar with the system side of NetWare.andM;Each vendor attempts to offer some relief here.andP;  IQ Technologies and Xircominclude instructions for using SHGEN in their documentation.andP;  Of the two, IQTechnologies' SHGEN instructions are more complete.andM;Xircom also provides pre-generated IPX.COM files that most users should findadequate.andP;  D-Link furnishes a batch file to set up a disk for use with SHGEN.andO;However, D-Link's documentation provides no instructions on using SHGEN;instead, it refers users to the NetWare manual covering the program.andM;IQ Technologies' documentation for the pLAN adapter is the best of the three.andO;It includes excellent illustrations and detailed instructions for connectingthe company's PPNA to a thin-wire Ethernet network.andP;  Xircom's documentationtakes second place, lacking mainly in illustrations and complete SHGENinstructions.andP;  D-Link's are weakest, especially lacking information on usingSHGEN to generate an IPX.COM file.andM;As the chart indicates, performance as tested with PC Week Labs' LANPerfbenchmarks is not consistent across computers.andP;  The Xircom adapter wasfastest on the Compaq LTE/20 and the Toshiba T1000SE portables, delivering60K bytes and 52K bytes per second of LAN throughput, respectively.andM;A PC's parallel port is not the best channel for network communications.andP;  TheLANPerf throughput rates achieved with the adapters are quite modest whencompared with those of thin Ethernet adapters that plug directly into theexpansion bus on a PC.andP;  Using the latter adapters, PC Week Labs typicallyobtains LANPerf throughput rates of at least 250K bytes -- often much higher.andM;The IQ Technologies and Xircom manuals both suggest that network throughputmight improve if the PC's parallel port were set for 8-bit bidirectional I/O.andO;Not all computers offer this option, however.andP;  Although the Toshiba T1000SEdoes, PC Week Labs found no difference in performance using LANPerf with theToshiba set for standard unidirectional parallel-port output mode or for8-bit bidirectional mode.andM;All three PPNAs coexisted without a problem on PC Week Labs' Ethernetnetwork, which featured a mix of computers running a variety of NovellEthernet LAN adapters.andP;  Also, the three PPNAs were able to run the full rangeof test applications from the network with no difficulty.andM;With their small size and lighter weight, the D-Link and Xircom adapters arethe most portable.andM;These adapters add only a 6-inch extension to the parallel printer port, andadd little bulk and weight to a portable PC's carrying case.andP;  Given a longenough Ethernet cable, they also tend not to hinder movement of the portableonce it is attached to the network.andM;IQ Technologies' pLAN adapter is larger and heavier than D-Link's andXircom's.andP;  It is less portable and its heavy, 1.5-foot-long connecting cablemakes moving the portable more difficult.andM;On balance, Xircom's Pocket Ethernet Adapter offers the best combination ofperformance and portability.andP;  The IQ Technologies and D-Link PPNAs tie for aclose second, mainly due to their slower network throughput.andM;Also, IQ Technologies' entry receives lower marks for its large size, andD-Link's PPNA receives lower marks for its relatively poor documentation.andO;Due to its large size, the pLAN adapter is better suited to more permanentdesktop installations.andP;  D-Link's unit is the best for the traveling portable.andM;</TEXT></DOC>
