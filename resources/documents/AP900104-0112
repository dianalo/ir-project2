But thereisn't a lot of evidence that actions were taken as a result ofthat,'' Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams told reporters.   ``A bodyguard, during a debriefing interview, said that two U.S.soldiers had been overheard discussing their positions for H-hour.And that supposedly happened at 10 p.m., three hours before theattack was to begin,'' said Williams. ``I have no other details.''   Noriega is believed to have escaped from one of his residencesminutes before a U.S. commando unit arrived just after midnightDec. 20, and fled from house to house in Panama City in the daysthereafter, according to military officals. Noriega found refuge inthe Vatican Embassy on Dec. 24, and turned himself over to U.S.officials Wednesday.   Fighting has all but ceased in Panama, said Williams, andPentagon officials were withdrawing some troops and sending newones in their place.   The number of U.S. servicemen in Panama stood at about 25,000,the same as it was shortly after the invasion, as combat troopswere withdrawn and replaced by military police and civil affairsspecialists, said Williams.   The spokesman was unable to give a breakdown of the remainingtroops by unit and function, or to say whether or when the numberof troops in Panama would be reduced to the pre-invasion level ofabout 12,000.   The troops are stationed there to guard the Panama Canal underthe terms of bilateral treaty under which the United States is toturn the waterway over to Panama in the year 2000.   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, flewto Panama today to assess the withdrawal schedule.   Williams said that four Noriega associates remain inside theVatican embassy despite Noriega's decision to surrender.   He identified the four as: Lt. Col. Nivaldo Madrinan, directorof the Panamanian equivalent of the FBI and CIA; Capt. AsuncionGaitan, an escort to Noriega; Carlos Castillo, leader of apro-Noreiga political party, and Castillo's wife, Belgica Castillo,director of immigration.   In other developments, two U.S. servicemen had been killed andthree others injured in non-combat incidents, said Williams, but hedid not have details.   The number of American troops killed in action stood at 23, andthe nunmber wounded at 323. All of the combat casualties were men,he said. Three U.S. civilians were killed and one was injured.   Among Noreiga's Panama Defense Forces, said Williams, 314 werekilled and 124 were wounded in the fighting.   Williams also said that U.S. forces had collected 76,553 weaponsin Panama, including 7,743 under a cash-for-guns program that hascost the U.S. government $691,000.   Additionally, said Williams, U.S. forces had captured 39 armoredvehicles, 36 aircraft and seven vessels. He was unable to specifywhat would become of the armaments.</TEXT></DOC>
