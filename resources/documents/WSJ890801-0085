Yesterday's long-awaited reduction follows a similar cut Friday by San Francisco-based Bank of America. The banks took their time in following Chase Manhattan Bank, which often leads prime-rate changes and which reduced its own prime rate from 11% three weeks ago.    The prime rate is closely watched because bankers say they use it as a base to calculate more than one-third of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate consumer and business loans.    &quot;Some people who have variable-rate loans could benefit right away&quot; from yesterday's action, says Irwin Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., one big bank that cut its prime. Consumers should look for lower rates on home equity loans and personal lines of credit, he says. But credit card rates aren't expected to decline.    General Motors Acceptance Corp. said the lower prime rate will immediately affect the rate it charges automobile dealers for cars. However, it will take awhile before the prime rate cut &quot;follows through to the consumer&quot; in the way of lower auto financing costs, a spokesman said.    Consumer borrowing costs generally have been falling more slowly than rates in the financial marketplace. The prime rate changes periodically to reflect banks' own borrowing costs in the financial markets.    The prime rate has fallen from 11.5% in early June, mainly because the rates that banks pay on certificates of deposit, Eurodollars and savings accounts have declined. For example, interest rates on three-month Eurodollars, or U.S. currency held in foreign accounts, have declined to just above 8.5% from 10% in early May. And the rates on three-month CDs in the U.S. now are about 8.4%, off from 9.45%. The nation's largest corporations aren't directly affected by prime rate changes because many can borrow at rates well below the prime. Bankers are willing to offer these companies attractive rates to keep them from turning to alternative sources of credit, such as foreign markets or the short-term corporate IOUs known as commercial paper.    Many companies in recent weeks already have taken advantage of falling interest rates by rushing to borrow through the credit markets, where rates have fallen faster than at commercial banks.    Economists have been waiting for banks to cut the prime rates again after it became clear several weeks ago that the Federal Reserve was seeking an easier monetary policy.    At its meeting July 5 and 6, the Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee voted to supply enough additional credit to the economy to reduce the federal funds interest rate half a percentage point, to about 9%.    With that now accomplished, the Fed is unlikely to ease further before the committee meets Aug. 22 -- unless new signs of a sharp economic slowdown emerge before then. The federal funds rate, at which banks lend to one another overnight, is the market interest rate over which the Fed has the most direct control. It drifted as low as 8 7/8% yesterday, down from Friday's 8 15/16%.    Some bankers say they hesitated to follow Chase's move three weeks ago, in part, because they wanted more evidence that the Fed would continue to ease. Confirmation came last week when the Fed allowed its closely watched federal funds rates fall to 9%.    One economist said, however, that other banks &quot;lagged beyond what one would normally be expected, out of greed,&quot; deciding to hold on as long as possible before passing along their own lower borrowing costs to consumers.    Considering how long it took the others to follow, some people question whether Chase -- which has often led prime rate increases -- will take the lead again anytime soon. &quot;They were out on a limb for a long time,&quot; one banker said.    First National Bank of Chicago was the first big bank to cut the prime yesterday, doing so shortly before the opening of the stock market. Citibank, Continental Bank and Chemical Bank quickly followed suit. By the end of the day, all of the nation's 30 major banks cut their prime rate to 10.5%. </TEXT></DOC>
