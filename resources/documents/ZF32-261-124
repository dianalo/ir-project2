 The SQL Engine is designed to provide a complete,multi-user relational database management system (RDBMS) capable of handlingthe most challenging network database applications.andP;  The SQL Engine is saidto allow organizations to integrate their desktop systems with ahigh-performance database server to create powerful cooperative processingapplications--from decision support to on-line transaction processing (OLTP).andO;Database performance is said to be up 100 times that of other servers, makingthe SQL Engine suitable for multiple-user database applications wheretransaction volume and response time are critical.andP;  The SQL Engine'sfull-function relational database allows multiple users concurrent access todata.andM;Lessons from mainframe applications have shown that database performance isnot simply a result of CPU power; rather it is the result of several systemfunctions--effective disk I/O, bus speed, and CPU performance.andP;  Becausesingle-processor servers require large amounts of data to be transferredacross a standard data bus for the CPU to process, performance bottlenecksare likely.andP;  The SQL Engine is designed to eliminate these bottlenecks bymoving database functions to Relational Co-Processors, to accelerate thedata-transfer capability with multiple high-speed data buses.andP;  The SQLEngine's multi-processor, multi-bus architecture is optimized specificallyfor database performance.andM;SQL Engine Architecture, System OverviewandM;The SQL Engine extends the client-server model to resolve performanceproblems of database management systems.andP;  While client-server computing andSQL can increase the performance of network database systems, they do notaddress the performance associated with multi-user database products.andM;In the LAN environment, database management systems began with file servers.andO;File servers store database files in one central location.andP;  The PC thenprocesses the data and extracts the requested information.andP;  Because fileservers often transfer entire data files, the LAN can bog down and become aperformance bottleneck.andP;  With the emergence of the client-server model andsubsequent database servers, however, the performance bottleneck is movedfrom the LAN to the server.andP;  Most database servers reside on single-processorsystems--PCs, workstations, or minis.andP;  Clients, or end-user systems,communicate with the server over aandM;LAN.andP;   The client sends an SQL request to the server, and theandM;server replies with an answer.andP;  The network carries only the query and itsresponse rather than an entire file.andP;  This reduces LAN traffic and increasesperformance, but it does not eliminate the bottleneck:  rather it just movesit to the server (see Figure 1).andM;Now the bottleneck is located in the server, i.e., the server's backplanebus--the bus between the CPU and mass storage--is the bottleneck.andP;  Entirefiles move across this bus from the disk to be processed; the server's CPUthen extracts the relevant data and sends the answer to the client.andP;  Thisslows performance, because, in essence, the server's bus has become aminiature LAN bottleneck between the server's CPU and its mass storage.andM;The SQL Engine is designed to address these database performance problemswith multiple-processor technology.andP;  While other servers reduce LAN traffic,they often simply move the bottleneck to the server bus.andP;  The SQL Engineattempts to eliminate the bottleneck by reducing traffic on this bus.andM;Performance is improved and bottlenecks are eliminated by moving theclient-server concept inside the SQL Engine.andP;  The SQL Engine contains aclient and a server, referred to as the front-end and the backend,respectively.andP;  The front-end CPU manages tasks for multiple clients and sendstheir queries to the back-end, which is responsible for disk control, memorycontrol, and execution of key relational operations.andP;  The back-end gathersand reduces information and returns a succinct answer back, via the backplanebus, to the front-end.andP;  The front-end then prepares that answer forpresentation and sends it, via the backplane, to the client.andP;  A closer lookat the internal architecture of the SQL Engine serves to illustrate howExtended Systems is attempting to eliminate internal bottlenecks (refer toFigure 2).andP;  The key components are the bus expander and the high-speedrelational co-processor.andP;  The bus expander shifts the data transfer task fromthe backplane bus to the high-speed (HSX) bus in the back-end of the server.andO;The RISC relational co-processor reduces relational tables by performingprojects (reducing columns) and selects (reducing rows) on data moving frommass storage to cache memory.andP;  This reduces the data which must be sentacross the backplane bus to make more effective use of cache memory.andM;Standard Microprocessor SubsystemandM;The standard Intel microprocessor subsystem includes the processor unit (inwhich the multi-user relational database management system (RDBMS) runs),standard LAN cards used to communicate to and from the client, and the localIntel backplane bus.andP;  The RDBMS prepares data requests for the back-end ofthe server.andP;  The microprocessor creates primitive relational requests andsends them across the Intel bus to the bus expander.andP;  Once the data isreturned to the microprocessor, the microprocessor prepares and sends answersback to the client across standard network connections.andM;The industry-standard backplane allows the use of a standard modem card (forthe remote-support feature) and a variety of front-end communication options.andM;Bus ExpanderandM;The bus expander performs several functions.andP;  First, it is the physicalconnection between the server's back-end and front-end.andP;  It accelerates the200-Kbps transfer rate of the Intel bus to a 2-Mbps transfer rate of the HSXbus.andP;  Second, it can host four 4- Mbyte standard PC memory cards, for a totalof 16 Mbytes of cache.andP;  Since cache memory no longer resides on the Intelbackplane, the bus expander can load and unload memory without interferencefrom the microprocessor subsystem.andP;  In addition, the bus expander is the mainprocessor's control access path, via an SCSI bus, to the disks for directdisk I/O.andP;  The industry-standard SCSI bus allows multiple hard disks andtapes to be attached.andP;  Finally, the bus expander also provides a connectionfor the high-speed relational co-processor.andM;RISC Relational Co-ProcessorandM;The bus expander alone does not solve the bottleneck problem: without thehigh-speed relational co-processor, the bus expander would only push the datainto the existing bottleneck at a higher rate.andP;  By removing unnecessary rowsand columns from data tables before it is transferred back across the Intelbus, the high-speed relational co-processor reduces LAN traffic and theperformance bottlenecks.andM;Relational database management systems are based upon set theory andrelational algebra.andP;  Relational algebra is well defined and can be broken upinto basic operations, or primitives.andP;  These primitives are not subject tochange in a relational system.andP;  The SQL Engine moves the primitive relationaloperations into the RISC relational co-processor.andP;  RISC technology iswell-suited to relational operations, as there are only 12 major operationsthat are performed 90% of the time.andM;The high-speed relational co-processor performs key relational operations ondata as it comes off the disk into cache memory.andP;  Examples of primitiveoperations are the SELECT and WHERE clauses in an SQL query.andP;  To understandhow the RISC relational co-processor operates, by way of example consider acustomer database consisting of 50,000 records:  each record has 10 dataitems (i.e., name, title, address, orders...); the following query is thenentered:andM;SELECT name, ordersandM;FROM order_tableandM;WHERE orders andgt; 50000;andM;as the data is retrieved from the hard disk, the relational co-processorreduces the data to two columns: name and orders.andP;  It also handles the WHEREclause and strips out any rows where the orders field is not greater than$50,000.andP;  This reduces the data to what is needed for computation and storesit in cache memory for processing.andP;  In actual byte reduction, the relationalco-processor reduces the original table of 5,000,000 bytes to 920 bytes ofrequired data (based on 40 qualified customers).andP;  This reduction is done atthe same time and same speed as data is read from the disks.andM;The relational co-processor reduces the amount of data moving across theIntel bus, thereby allowing concurrent tasks to be performed faster andincreasing multi-user performance.andP;  This decreases the workload for the Intelmicroprocessor.andM;Other primitive operations--such as joins and sorts--are also handled by theRISC processor.andP;  As enhanced routines for the RISC relational co-processorbecome available, updating the SQL Engine is a relatively simple matter.andP;  Asoftware update loads new code into the system for use by the RISC chip.andM;Growth FlexibilityandM;The SQL Engine's open architecture enables multiple industry-- standard diskdrives to be installed as database storage requirements grow.andP;  Cache memorycan be expanded by adding multiple PC AT-compatible memory cards.andP;  The SQLEngine accommodates up to five mass storage devices and four cache memorycards.andP;  In addition, support of multiple network connection cards enables upto three network interfaces to be added as they become necessary.andM;Open System Architecture, CompatibilityandM;Standards are increasingly important in this rapidly changing and growingindustry.andP;  The open system architecture of the SQL Engine establisheslong-term compatibility by incorporating standard interfaces throughout thesystem, to ensure integration with existing systems and protect customers'investments.andP;  Some of the industry standards supported include:andM;-    ANSI SQLandM;-    IBM SAAandM;-    IBM's Extended Edition Database Manager APIandM;-    DOS, OS/2, UNIX ClientsandM;-    SCSI Storage MediaandM;Software Standards For InteroperabilityandM;The SQL Engine supports ANSI SQL and standard host languages such as C andCobol.andP;  Programmers can write database applications by embedding SQL in astandard programming language using one of the SQL Engine's precompilers.andP;  Inaddition, the SQL Engine supports IBM's OS/2 Extended Edition DatabaseManager Application Programming Interface.andP;  This SAA-compatible interfaceallows those development tools and applications which support OS/2 ExtendedEdition to take advantage of the performance benefits of the SQL Engineserver.andM;Network Support For System ConnectivityandM;The SQL Engine supports multiple, simultaneous LAN connections usingindustry-standard, intelligent network cards.andP;  The intelligent network cardsfree the main CPU from processing network communication and control,resulting in faster transaction processing and throughput.andP;  A variety ofnetwork environments are supported.andM;Database ReliabilityandM;Extended Systems offers a support program backed by support professionalsproviding on-line telephone support to on-site consulting and repair.andP;  Thestandard configuration for each system includes a modem for remotediagnostics and support.andP;  All systems include a tape drive and backup andrestore utilities to facilitate data protection.andP;  In the event of a powerfailure, non-volatile RAM expedites system restart by saving in-processtransactions.andM;ConclusionandM;Applications such as database servers are clearly amenable to hardwarespeed-up techniques.andP;  However, from an historical perspective, such productsalone do not seem to be enough to guarantee success:  software support seemsto be the key issue.andP;  So while the SQL Engine offers an array of hardwarefeatures to improve performance, the ultimate success of the product willdepend on its SQL and networking support, and on customers' perception ofthat support.andM;For further information, contact Tom Loutzenheiser at Extended Systems, 6123North Meeker Avenue, Boise, ID 83704;
