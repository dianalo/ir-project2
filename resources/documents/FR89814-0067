PGT's proposal also involves transporting gas forcustomers in the Pacific Northwest. Each customer to be served by the proposedpipelines would be responsible for securing gas supplies from producersin Canada which PGT or Altamont would then transport. Neither PGT nor Altamontwould own the gas transported through their respective systems. PGT would receive the gas at the United States/Canadian border at Kingsgate,British Columbia, from Alberta Natural Gas Company, Ltd. for transportationto points of interconnection with Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest)at Stanfield, Oregon and with Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PGandamp;E)at Malin, Oregon. Northwest would deliver the gas to customers in the PacificNorthwest and intermountain region, while PGandamp;E would deliver gas tocustomers within the State of California. Altamont would receive gas froman expanded NOVA Corporation of Alberta (NOVA) system at the border nearWild Horse, Alberta, for transportation to a point of interconnection withNorthwest and Kern River Gas Transmission Company (Kern River) at Opal,Wyoming. The proposed Kern River System would then deliver the gas to southernCalifornia.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The environmental impacts associated with the proposedKern River pipeline were analyzed in the Mojave/Kern River/El Dorado EnvironmentalImpact Statement issued by the FERC in December 1987. The Kern River pipelinewould extend 837 miles between Opal, Wyoming and Bakersfield, California,and involve the installation of 36,200 housepower of new compression facilities.<ITAG tagnum="84">PGT/PGandamp;E Expansion Project </ITAG>PGT proposes to construct seven 36- and 42-inch diameter pipeline loops,for a total of 430 miles, extending from Kingsgate through the States ofIdaho, Washington, and Oregon at a cost of $946 million.\2\<NOTE/> The expansion would enable PGT to transport up to an additional710 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of natural gas. PGandamp;E wouldconstruct 415 miles of 36-inch-diameter pipeline loop, in 5 segments, fromthe Oregon-California border to a point near Panoche Station, California,thereby increasing its system capacity by 600 MMcf/d. (See table 1 andfigure 1.) \3\<NOTE/> In addition to the pipeline facilities, PGT and PGandamp;Epropose to make minor modifications at 17 of their existing compressorstations. Additional compression (22,500 horsepower) would be requiredat the Brentwood Compressor Station. PGandamp;E filed an application withthe California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) on April 14, 1989, toconstruct its proposed facilities. Although PGandamp;E is not regulated bythe FERC, PGT's and PGandamp;E's proposals are being considered togetheras one project known as the PGT/PGandamp;E Expansion Project for the purposesof environmental review. The PGT/PGandamp;E Expansion Project is scheduledfor construction in early 1992, with an operational date of November 30,1993. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ A pipeline loop is a segment which is constructed paralleland adjacent to an existing pipeline. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Figures 1 and 2, and the appendix are not printed in the<T4>Federal Register, </T4>but are available from the FERC's Division ofProgram Management, Public Reference Section, telephone (202) 357-8118.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>PGT/PG</T4>andamp;<T4>E Expansion Project Facility Locations</T4><H1>Proposed facilities</H1><H1>Pipe diameter (inches)</H1><H1>Length (miles)</H1><H1>State</H1><H1>County</H1>PGT<ITAG tagnum="3">Loop 1 </ITAG><D>42 </D><D>20.5 </D><D>ID </D><D>Boundary.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Loop 2 </ITAG><D>42 </D><D>35.0 </D><D>ID </D><D>Bonner, Kootenai.</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D> </D><D> </D><D>WA </D><D>Spokane.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Loop 3 </ITAG><D>42 </D><D>18.2 </D><D>WA </D><D>Whitman.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Loop 4 </ITAG><D>42 </D><D>30.0 </D><D>WA </D><D>Walla Walla.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Loop 5 </ITAG><D>36 </D><D>134.3 </D><D>OR </D><D>Umatilla, Morrow, Gilliam, Sherman, Wasco, Jefferson.

The Altamont pipeline would receive naturalgas at the Alberta-Montana border from NOVA and transport it across Montanaand Wyoming for delivery to Kern River near Opal, Wyoming. The pipeline'sdaily design capacity would enable firm delivery service of approximately700 MMcfd of natural gas at Opal. To accomplish this, Altamont proposesto construct 620 miles of 30-inch-diameter pipeline, 6 compressor stations,1 meter station, and related appurtenant facilities including pipelinescraper launchers and receivers, mainline valves, and a microwave communicationssystem. (See table 2 and figure 2.) \4\ Overall, the proposed route parallelsexisting linear facilities (roads, railroads, existing pipelines) or utilitycorridors for about 50 percent of its length. Construction is proposedto commence in June 1993 and be completed for an in-service date of November1, 1993. The proposed facilities are estimated to cost $580 million. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,8,r36</C><T4>Table</T4> 2._Altamont Gas Transportation Project Geographical Distributionof Facilities<H1>State and County</H1><H1>Miles of Pipe \1\ (approximate)</H1><H1>Compressor Station (CS) Number and Horsepower (HP) \2\</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Montana<D>305</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Hill<D>49</D><D>CS 1_44,333 hp.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Chouteau<D>63</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Fergus<D>31</D><D>CS 2_10,743 hp.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Judith Basin<D>25</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Wheatland<D>38</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Golden Valley<D>8</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Stillwater<D>44</D><D>CS 3_10,622 hp.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Carbon<D>47</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Wyoming<D>315</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Big Horn<D>70</D><D>CS 4_10,323 hp.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Washakie<D>31</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Hot Springs<D>20</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Fremont<D>111</D><D>CS 5_9,819 hp.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Sublette<D>3</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Sweetwater <D>55</D><D>CS 6_9,224 hp.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Lincoln<D>25</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total</ITAG><D>620</D><D>95,064 hp.</D><F>\1\ All pipe to be 30-inch outside diameter.</F><F>\2\ All compressors to be centrifugal-type units with gas powered drivers.Horsepower listed is site-rated to account for anticipated elevations andambient temperatures.</F></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">General Construction Procedures</ITAG>The proposed facilities would be designed, constructed, and operated inaccordance with all applicable regulations, including: 49 CFR Part 192_Transportationof Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline, Minimum Federal Safety Standards;18 CFR Part 2.69_Guidline to be Followed by Natural Gas Pipeline Companiesin the Planning, Clearing, and Maintenance of Rights-of-Way; and otherapplicable Federal, state, and local regulations and permit requirements.\4\<NOTE/> \5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ See footnote 3.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Because PGandamp;E is not regulated by the FERC, 18 CFRPart 2.69 is not applicable to PGandamp;E's proposed facilities.Construction would begin with right-of-way (ROW) clearing and grading.Pipeline loops in or adjacent to existing ROWs, such as those proposedby PGT and PGandamp;E, would generally require less clearing and grading.Rotary-wheeled ditching machines, backhoes, or rippers, would be used toexcavate a sufficiently deep trench. For buried pipelines, the U.S. Departmentof Transportation (DOT) requires a minimum of 30 inches of cover in normalsoils and 18 inches in consolidated rock. In populated areas, this increaseto 36 and 24 inches of cover, respectively. Blasting would be requiredwhen areas of consolidated rock are encountered.After trenching, the pipe would be strung along the ROW, bent to conformwith the bottom of the trench, and welded and radiographically inspectedin compliance with the DOT's Minimum Federal Safety Standards. Before beingemplaced in the trench, the pipe would be coated to inhibit corrosion.The pipe would then be placed in the trench and the trench would be backfilledwith the excavated material. Select backfill would be used where the trenchwas excavated in rock. The ROW would be restored to near-original contours,and reseeded, limed, fertilized, and mulched in accordance with the company'serosion control and revegetation plan. In general, construction at anyone place along the pipelines would take 6 to 8 weeks between the initialland disturbance and the end of restoration. Construction at new or existingcompressor station locations would be concurrent with the pipeline construction.The methods of crossing streams and rivers would vary according to specificcharacteristics such as width, depth, flow, riverbed geology and environmentalsensitivity. As a general rule, stream and river crossings would be constructedby opening a trench in the river bottom with a backhoe or dragline. Impactscould be minimized by constructing during low flow periods. Special proceduresmay be warranted at crossing that are environmentally sensitive (e.g.,in scenic areas, upstream of public water intakes, in or near criticalwildlife of fishery habitat).<ITAG tagnum="84">Land Requirements</ITAG>PGT and PGandamp;E would construct their pipeline loops adjacent to theirexisting pipelines in most locations. On private land, ROW widths rangebetween 15 and 100 feet. Many of the existing easements contain a provisionfor the installation of a second pipeline. Where the existing ROW is 100feet wide, no new permanent ROW would be required. However, PGT and PGandamp;Eare requesting an additional 30 feet of temporary construction ROW. Southof milepost (MP) 923.8 (the beginning of Loop 12), PGandamp;E proposes toacquire between 20 and 50 feet of additional permanent easement and between15 and 40 feet of temporary construction ROW. The loops would be installedon or adjacent to the existing ROWs for all but approximately 96 miles.In the areas where the loops would deviate from the existing ROW, the widthof the construction ROW would very between 75 and 105 feet, while the newpermanent ROW would be maintained at between 50 and 75 feet, respectively.On Federal land, the existing easements do not have provisions for an additionalpipline. Existing ROW widths range between 50 feet and 100 feet. However,PGT and PGandamp;E propose to place the loops on the Federal ROW grantedas part of the Alaska Natural Gas Transmission System (ANGTS).\6\<NOTE/> The total width of the two ROWs generally varies between76 and 106 feet. In addition, the companies request between 40 and 75 feetof temporary ROW.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ In March 1976, the U.S. Dept of the Interior issued theFinal EIS for the ANGTS. ROW grants to cross Federal lands in Idaho, Washington,and Oregon were issued to PGT on July 22, 1985 and appear to remain operational.In addition to the pipeline ROW, PGT and PGandamp;E would require 4 acresfor the expansion of the Bend Compressor Station (MP 472.8) located inDeschutes National Forest in Oregon, and 22 acres for the additional compressorsat the Brentwood Compressor Station (MP 923.8) located in Contra CostaCounty, California.Altamont proposes to acquire a 100-foot-wide construction ROW, of whichapproximately 50 feet would be maintained as permanent easement. The sixnew compressor stations would require 8 to 10 acres each, while the meterstation would be sited on a 2-acre plot. Additional temporary work spacemay be required at major river, road or railroad crossing, or where similarobstacles are encountered. Overall, the proposal would directly affectan estimated 7,580 acres of Federal, state and private lands during constructionand 3,820 acres during operation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Notice of Intent</ITAG>On June 13, 1989, the FERC and the CPUC entered into a Memorandum of Understandingto combine their efforts to prepare an Environmental Impact Report/Statement(EIR/EIS) in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) for the proposed PGT/PGandamp;EExpansion Project. Recognizing then that the application for Altamont wasto be filed with the FERC in July 1989 (and is now in fact filed) the respectivestaffs of the FERC and the CPUC agreed to include the Altamount Projectinto a single EIR/EIS covering both projects. The rationale for this isthat the Altamount Project is an alternative to the PGT/PGandamp;E ExpansionProject.Notice is hereby given that the staff of the FERC has determined that approvalof either of these projects would be a major Federal action significantlyaffecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, pursuant toandSection; 380.6(a)(3) of the FERC's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18CFR 380.6(a)(3)), and EIS will be prepared. Similarly, the staff of theCPUC has determined that an EIR, as required by CEQA, will be prepared.This notice serves as the Notice of Intent required by NEPA. The FERC willbe the lead Federal agency and the CPUC will be the lead agency for theState of California for the preparation of the joint EIR/EIS. Other stateswith environmental laws similar to NEPA and CEQA may ultimately designatea lead state agency to coordinate their efforts directly with the FERCas a cooperating agency. The EIR/EIS will be prepared by an environmentalconsultant under contract to the CPUC and the joint supervision of boththe FERC and the CPUC. The contractor procurement process has begun withthe issuance of a Requst For Proposal (RFP) by the CPUC on July 10, 1989.It is expected that the contractor will be selected by late August or earlySeptember 1989 and scoping meetings will be conducted during the week ofSeptember 18, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Outline of Preliminary Environmental Issues</ITAG>The EIR/EIS will address significant environmental concerns that have beenand will be identified by the FERC and CPUC staffs, the environmental contractor,intervenors, other Federal and state agencies, and individuals who respondto this notice.
