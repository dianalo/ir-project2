TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israelis on Thursday reacted with variousdegrees of skepticism and coolness to the latest statements ofmoderation from PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was quoted by aides as dismissingArafat's acceptance of Israel as part of a ``campaign of deceit.''They said it was aimed at duping Western countries, particularly theUnited States.   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, head of the left-leaning LaborParty, said on Israel's armed forces radio that ``the PLO haslearned ... to say one thing and do another.''   Peres suggested there may be room for a dialogue if the PLO metthree conditions: recognition of Israel's right to live in peace, ahalt to terrorism inside and outside Israel, and unqualifiedacceptance of U.N. resolutions that guarantee Israel's right toexist in secure borders.   The most welcoming comments came from leftists like Ran Cohen, aParliament member of the Citizens Rights Movement who urged thegovernment to ``bless the process and ask how we can advance it.''   But answering Cohen in an Israel Radio debate, hawkish formerU.N. Ambassador Binyamin Netanyahu accused the PLO of ``usingdeclarations of peace as tactics of war.''   Most Israelis did not see either the Palestine National Councildeclaration in November or Arafat's elaboration in Sweden onWednesday as sincere or convincing recognition of Israel'slegitimacy.   ``If ever a mountain gave birth to a mouse, that was it,'' saidthe Jerusalem Post, a liberal English-language daily. ``Theambiguities ... have been compounded, not removed.''   Arafat's campaign of moderation has had an impact, however.Repeated public statements of a willingness to talk peace and acceptIsrael chip away at the skepticism and strengthen liberal argumentsthat the Arabs genuinely seek peace.   One sign of change is the recent endorsement of Israel-PLO talksby the Peace Now movement, a grassroots anti-war organization thatled the campaign for Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon.   Opinion polls have indicated the Israeli public is more flexiblethan the politicians about negotiating with the PLO. A Tel AvivUniversity survey of 1,180 Israeli adults conducted at the start ofthe Palestinian uprising found more than half ready for talks if thePLO changed its policies and recognized Israel.   Israelis remain hard to convince.   One reason is they have the precedent of the late EgyptianPresident Anwar Sadat, who underlined his sincerity by coming toJerusalem to address Israel's parliament in November 1977. He meltedpublic doubts even though Israelis had voted a right-wing governmentinto office only months before.   To many Israelis, Arafat's statements appeared directed more atwinning the recognition of the United States than at startingnegotiations with Israel.   ``He cannot achieve his aims as long as he cannot convince theIsraeli public that he really wants peace,'' said one official whodemanded anonymity.   ``He has real difficulty changing Israeli minds because they areless impressed by his words abroad than by the acts of terror inIsrael.''   Alon Liel, spokesman for Peres' Foreign Ministry said Arafat'sStockholm comments were ``moderate but very much different fromother PLO leaders'' who showed no willingness to accept Israel.   Hard-line Palestinian views appeared in graffiti on walls in theoccupied territories after Arafat's Stockholm statement, raisingquestions about the degree to which Arafat controlled the PLO.   ``No concessions, not even an inch of Palestine,'' said a leftistslogan spray-painted on a wall in the West Bank town of Nablus.   ``Yes to holy war against the enemy,'' declared a Moslemfundamentalist slogan on a wall in Bethlehem.</TEXT></DOC>
