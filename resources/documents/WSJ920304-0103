Coming are important regional votes in France on March22 and national elections in Britain, probably on April 9.They will indicate just how far left or right those nationswill lean during the years ahead, with policy implications onboth sides of the Atlantic.   But more telling than any of the others in terms ofdefining a nation's near future may well be parliamentaryvoting in Italy on April 5. Just who wins won't be theimportant news. More crucial will be what the outcome saysabout Italy's ability to get serious about governing itselfwell and remaining a key player as a united Europe seeks aglobal role.</LP><TEXT>   Calling any Italian election truly important may seemabsurd. This nation is now enduring, though certainly notenjoying, its 49th government since 1945, complete withGiulio Andreotti serving as prime minister for the seventhtime. Each new vote has brought in yet another weakcoalition, all with the Christian Democrats at the center anda seldom-changing cast of political characters geniallyswapping cabinet roles. (Mr. Andreotti, a superb tacticianwith no known political vision, is serving as a governmentminister for the 28th time.)   The country's political system has now become the issue.Few of these governments have accomplished much of note, andfew ever try. Now the belief is growing across Italy that itcan't afford this sort of thing anymore. State finances areabout the worst of any major world economy, governmentservices are costly and deteriorating, and the public is fedup. Though voting shifts in Italy are usually glacial, thistime polls show that an unprecedented 40% or more of allvoters claim to be undecided about whom to support.   In addition, the high price of government -- includingcostly goods and services sold by state-owned monopolies --is eroding the Italian private sector's competitive advantageat home and abroad. In earlier decades, Italian businesscould ignore much government bumbling and get on with thetask of creating jobs and making money. Now that's muchharder to do, especially as new European Community rules letin previously unknown competition. Rising costs at homehelped cause Italian exporters to lose global market sharelast year.   &quot;The last three years have been years of deepdeterioration,&quot; says Sergio de Nardis, an economist atConfindustria, the Italian industrial association.   Such issues fill the Italian press and dominate publicdebate. Yet the response of the political elite is vapid.Though each major party has a reform wing, many top leadersstill jockey for personal and party advantage. No big partyhas a serious plan for change, and none offers leadershipthat excites anyone.   As a result, all the parties stand to lose. The ChristianDemocrats are becoming &quot;Southernized,&quot; relying ever moreheavily on support bought by using taxes collected in therich north of Italy to subsidize the crime-ridden south. ItsSocialist partners are tainted by corruption talk. The formerCommunists, Italy's second largest party now renamed the LeftDemocratic Party, have no relevant political message and willsuffer accordingly.   The winners will be fringe groups and, above all,provincial &quot;leagues&quot; in the north that essentially areprotests against corruption and the costly subsidies for thesouth. They seem certain to gain many parliamentary seats.   All this promises greater fragmentation in the nextlegislature, and Italy &quot;could become ungovernable,&quot; saysPatrick McCarthy, a political scientist at the Bologna campusof Johns Hopkins University.   Yet that's where salvation may lie. Optimists such asGiorgio La Malfa, head of the small Republican Party, saysuch splintering will frighten the main parties into reform,if only to save themselves. Major changes could includemeasures to deny parliamentary seats to parties that fail toget, say, 5% of the total vote (as in Germany), leading tomore stable coalitions. Others could give the weak executivesome power over the budget process, curbing fiscalirresponsibility.   Failure to act carries enormous risks. Without bettermanagement, Italy could find itself with both a failingeconomy and disastrous state finances, unable to run with themain EC pack and unqualified to join its planned monetaryunion. The April 5 election won't suddenly provide thesolution. But it could start a process leading, perhaps byanother election soon after, to a political system in whichtoday's angry Italians finally could take pride.d</TEXT></DOC>
