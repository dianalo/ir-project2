Following the stellar performance of Vanguard Group'sindex funds, both Dreyfus Corp. and Fidelity Investments haveweighed in with index funds of their own. In recent weeks,both funds groups have come out with unmanaged portfolios ofthe stocks that make up the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stockindex; these funds are designed to closely track the Sandamp;P500's performance.</LP><TEXT>   Small investors are just waking up to the virtues of indexinvestments, which have already attracted about $250 billionfrom giant institutions. The oldest and largest of the indexmutual funds, Vanguard's Index Trust-500 Portfolio, notchedup an annualized total return of 17% in the 1980s, putting itin the top quarter of all stock mutual funds. At the sametime, the average stock fund returned just 15.5% a year.   As reported here earlier this year, the investment successof Vanguard's index funds was long ignored by Vanguard'scompetitors. Not any more. Both Dreyfus and Fidelity are nowrunning full page advertisements as they seek to wrestle ashare of the index-fund business away from Vanguard.   &quot;As far as a mutual-fund manager is concerned, an indexfund is a magical product,&quot; says one analyst. &quot;It already hasa performance record -- that of the index. I'm hard pressedto figure out why they didn't bring these funds out earlier.&quot;   Though it's still early, it seems that Dreyfus's andFidelity's index funds are proving a tough sell even thoughthey are holding down fees. So far, Dreyfus's Peoples IndexFund has assets of just $3.3 million (including $3 million ofthe company's own seed capital). And Fidelity's SpartanMarket Index Fund has $16 million (including $4 million inseed capital).   If Dreyfus and Fidelity thought that this year's indexfunds would match the popularity of last year's money-marketfunds, they have clearly been disappointed. Early in 1989,both Dreyfus and Fidelity brought out low-cost, money-marketfunds, jumping into an area previously dominated by Vanguard.Dreyfus's Worldwide Dollar Fund has since pulled in $7.3billion. Fidelity's Spartan Money Market Fund has snagged$8.3 billion.   &quot;They are jumping onto the index fund bandwagon, andthey're trying to get some attention by waiving the fees,&quot;says John Bogle, Vanguard's chairman. &quot;Fees are the onlything that distinguishes one money-market fund from another.When you get to an index fund, fees are just one of thethings that affect return. Only a moron would buy a stockfund to avoid a 0.5% expense ratio for two weeks or twomonths. Apparently the market place is smarter than the fundsponsors.&quot;   Dreyfus Chairman Howard Stein concedes that the PeoplesIndex Fund may not be the immediate success that theWorldwide Dollar Fund was. &quot;Yes, there is an educationproblem,&quot; he says. &quot;Yes, it will take time.&quot; A spokesman forDreyfus notes that while the fund group has been advertisingthe Peoples Index Fund for some time, prospectuses onlybecame available on May 4.   For years, Vanguard has had a virtual stranglehold on theindex-fund market. It offers index funds that track abond-market index, two international stock indexes and twosmall-company stock indexes. But its biggest winner has beenthe 500 Portfolio, which now has assets of $2.2 billion andso far this year has been the fund group's best selling stockfund.   As with its other funds, Vanguard's edge in the index-fundbusiness comes from its extremely low annual-expense ratios.The 500 Portfolio charges just 0.2% of assets annually, wellbelow the 1.5% typically charged by an actively managed stockfund.   To compete, both Dreyfus and Fidelity are holding downexpenses on their index funds. Dreyfus is absorbing allexpenses until the end of the year or until the fund hits$100 million in assets, whichever comes first. Fidelity haspromised to keep its expenses at 0.28% of assets until May 1,1991.   ---               Keeping Up With The Averages                                                                                                          After years of being ignored by the fund industry, indexfunds are starting to proliferate.
