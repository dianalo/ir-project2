Introduction</ITAG>a. AuthorityPart B of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Pub.L. 94-163, as amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA),Pub. L. 95-619, and by the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA),Pub. L. 100-12,\1\<NOTE/> created the Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Productsother than Automobiles. The consumer products subject to this program (oftenreferred to hereafter as ``covered products'') are: refrigerators, refrigerator-freezersand freezers; room air conditioners; central air conditioners and centralair conditioning heat pumps; water heaters; furnaces; dishwashers; clotheswashers; clothes dryers; direct heating equipment; kitchen ranges and ovens;pool heaters; and television sets; as well as any other consumer productclassified by the Secretary of Energy. See section 322. To date, the Secretaryhas not so classified any additional products. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Part B of Title III of EPCA as amended by NECPA and NAECA,is referred to in this notice as the ``Act.'' Part B of Title III is codifiedat 42 U.S.C. 6291 et seq. Part B of Title III of EPCA, as amended by NECPAonly, is referred to in this notice as NECPA.Under the Act, the program consists essentially of three parts: testing,labeling, and Federal energy conservation standards. The Department ofEnergy (DOE or Department), in consultation with the National Bureau ofStandards (NBS), is required to amend or establish new test proceduresas appropriate for each of the covered products. Section 323. The purposeof the test procedures is to provide for test results that reflect theenergy efficiency, energy use, or estimated annual operating costs of eachof the covered products. Section 323(b)(3). A test procedure is not requiredif DOE determines by rule that one cannot be developed. Section 323(d)(1).Beginning one hundred and eighty days after a test procedure for a productis adopted, no manufacturer may represent the energy consumption of, orthe cost of energy consumed by the product except as reflected in testsconducted according to the DOE procedure. Section 323(c)(2).The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is required by the Act to prescriberules governing the labeling of covered products for which test procedureshave been prescribed by DOE. Section 324(a). These rules are to requirethat each particular model of a covered product bears a label that indicatesits annual operating cost and the range of estimated annual operating costsfor other models of that product. Section 324(c)(1). Disclosure of estimatedoperating cost is not required under section 324 if the FTC determinesthat such disclosure is not likely to assist consumers in making purchasingdecisions or is not economically feasible. In such a case, FTC must requirea different useful measure of energy consumption. Section 324(c). At thepresent time there are FTC rules requiring labels under the Act for thefollowing products: room air conditioners, furnaces, clothes washers, dishwashers,water heaters, freezers, refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and centralair conditioners. 44 FR 66475, November 19, 1979, and 52 FR 46888, December10, 1987.For each of 11 of the covered products, the Act prescribes an initial Federalenergy conservation standard. Section 325(b)-(h). The Act establishes effectivedates for the standards in 1988, 1990, 1992 or 1993, depending on the product,and specifies that the standards are to be reviewed by the Department withinthree to ten years, also depending on the product. Section 325 (b) through(h). After the specified three- to ten-year period, DOE may promulgatenew standards for each product; however, such standards may not be lessstringent than those initially established by the Act. Section 325(1)(1).The Act also directs DOE to review, for possible amendment, the energyconservation standards on dishwashers, clothes washers, and clothes dryers,and to issue a final rule no later than January 1, 1990, for units manufacturedafter January 1, 1993. Section 325(g)(4)(A).The Act also permits the Department to prescribe standards for any othertype of consumer product that, using certain criteria, DOE may classifyas a covered product. Section 325 (i), (l) and (m). Any new or amendedstandard is required to be designed so as to achieve the maximum improvementin energy efficiency that is technologically feasible and economicallyjustified. Section 325(1)(2)(A).Section 325(1)(2)(B)(i) provides that before DOE determines whether a standardis economically justified, it must first solicit comments on a proposedstandard. After reviewing comments on the proposal, DOE must then determinethat the benefits of the standard exceed its burdens, based, to the greatestextent practicable, on a weighing of the following seven factors:(1) The economic impact of the standard on the manufacturers and on theconsumers of the products subject to such standard;(2) The savings in operating costs throughout the estimated average lifeof the covered product in this type (or class) compared to any increasein the price of, or in the initial charges for, or maintenance expensesof, the covered products which are likely to result from the impositionof the standard;(3) The total projected amount of energy savings likely to result directlyfrom the imposition of the standard;(4) Any lessening of the utility or the performance of the covered productslikely to result from the imposition of the standard;(5) The impact of any lessening of competition, determined in writing bythe Attorney General, that is likely to result from the imposition of thestandard;(6) The need for national energy conservation; and(7) Other factors the Secretary considers relevant. In addition, the Actspecifies criteria for petitions to DOE in regard to amendments to standards.Section 325(k). Under the Act, any person may petition the Department toamend a Federal energy conservation standard for any covered product. Section325(k)(1).b. BackgroundNECPA required the Secretary, by rule, to prescribe energy efficiency standardsfor each of 13 covered products.\2\<NOTE/> These standards were to be designed to achieve the maximumimprovement in energy efficiency that was technologically feasible andeconomically justified. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The consumer products covered by NECPA included: refrigeratorsand refrigerator-freezers; freezers; dishwashers; clothes dryers; waterheaters; room air conditioners; home heating equipment not including furnaces;television sets; kitchen ranges and ovens; clothes washers; humidifiersand dehumidifiers; central air conditioners; and furnaces.NECPA provided, however, that no standard for a product was to be establishedif there were no test procedure for the product, or if DOE determined byrule either that a standard would not result in significant conservationof energy, or that a standard was not technologically feasible or economicallyjustified. In determining whether a standard was economically justified,the Department was directed to determine whether the benefits of the standardexceeded its burdens by weighing the seven factors set forth above.NECPA specified the priorities and procedures to be followed in adoptingefficiency standards. Nine of the 13 covered products were given priority.These nine products were: refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers, freezers,clothes dryers, water heaters, room air conditioners, home heating equipmentnot including furnaces, kitchen ranges and ovens, and central air conditioners.The DOE published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking for the ninefirst priority products on January 2, 1979. 44 FR 20. On December 13, 1979,the DOE published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking for dishwashers,television sets, clothes washers, and humidifiers and dehumidifiers. 44FR 72276. An advance notice for central air conditioners (heat pumps) waspublished on January 23, 1980. 45 FR 5602.After receiving comments on the advance notices, on June 30, 1980, DOEpublished its first proposed rulemaking for the nine products. 45 FR 43976.(Hereafter referred to as the June 1980 proposal.) The June 1980 proposalset forth DOE's proposed energy efficiency standards for these coveredproducts. It also proposed comprehensive requirements for certificationand enforcement of the standards and procedures for processing petitionsby States that sought exemption for regulations subject to the generalpreemption requirements of NECPA.On April 2, 1982, DOE issued a further notice of proposed rulemaking withrespect to the nine priority products. 47 FR 14424. (Hereafter referredto as the April 1982 proposal). With respect to eight of the products,DOE proposed to make a determination that a standard would not result insignificant conservation of energy and would not be economically justified.\3\<NOTE/> The April 1982 proposal also proposed rules governing petitionsto DOE both by States to obtain exemption from preemption of State or localenergy efficiency standards, as well as by manufacturers to obtain preemptionof State or local standards.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The April 1982 proposal did not propose any rule withrespect to the product type ``home heating equipment, not including furnaces''or with respect to that class of the product water heaters made up of heatpump water heaters or with respect to those classes of the product centralair conditioners that are heat pumps.On December 22, 1982, DOE published a final rule in which DOE determinedthat efficiency standards were not warranted for clothes dryers and kitchenranges and ovens. 47 FR 57198. (Hereafter referred to as the December 1982final rule.) At that time, DOE also adopted final procedures by which Statesmight obtain exemption for State or local efficiency standards from Federalpreemption, and by which manufacturers might obtain preemption of a Stateor local standard not otherwise preempted.On August 30, 1983, DOE published a final rule with respect to the remainingsix covered products: refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers, freezers,water heaters, furnaces, room air conditioners and central air conditioners.48 FR 39376. (Hereafter referred to as the August 1983 final rule). Foreach of the six products covered by the August 1983 final rule, exceptcentral air conditioners, DOE determined that an energy efficiency standardwould not result in significant conservation of energy and would not beeconomically justified. With respect to central air conditioners, DOE foundthat an energy efficiency standard would result in significant conservationof energy, but would not be economically justified.On April 1, 1985, DOE published a proposed rule with respect to four coveredproducts: dishwashers, television sets, clothes washers and humidifiersand dehumidifiers. 50 FR 12966. (Hereafter referred to as the April 1985proposal). For each of the four products covered by the 1985 proposal,DOE proposed that an energy efficiency standard would not be economicallyjustified and would not result in a significant conservation of energy.During 1983, DOE's December 1982 and August 1983 final rules were challengedin a lawsuit brought by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) andothers against the Department. On July 16, 1985, the U.S. Court of Appealsset aside DOE's December 1982 and August 1983 final rules. <T3>NRDC </T3>v. <T3>Herrington, </T3>768 F.2d 1355 (D.C. Cir. 1985).Consequently, on March 5, 1986, DOE published notices in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>removing the December 1982 and August 1983 finalrules and withdrawing the April 1985 proposal. 51 FR 7549 and 51 FR 7582.The National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA), which became lawon March 17, 1987, amended EPCA in part by: redefining ``covered products''(specifically, refrigerators/refrigerator-freezers, and freezers were combinedinto one product type from two; humidifiers and dehumidifiers were deleted;and pool heaters were added); establishing Federal energy conservationstandards for 11 of the 12 covered products (with television sets beingthe exception); and creating a schedule for which these standard levelsare to be reviewed to determine if they should be amended. The effectivedate of NAECA's standards for the three products being addressed in thisANOPR was January 1, 1988.The Act directs DOE to publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking(ANOPR), with a 60-day comment period, in advance of the Department's considerationof prescribing a new or amended standard. Section 325(m)(1). On December7, 1987, DOE published such an ANOPR with respect to consideration of amendingthe NAECA-imposed standard levels on refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers,and freezers, of establishing a small gas furnace standard between 71 percentand 78 percent efficiency, and of considering energy conservation standardsfor television sets.Publication of the final rule in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>for which this document is an advance noticeis scheduled by January 1, 1990. The purpose of this rulemaking is to review,for possible amendment, the energy conservation standards for dishwashers,clothes washers, and clothes dryers, that have been established by theAct.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Methodology</ITAG>This section provides a brief description of the analysis of the impactsof standards. It offers an overview of the analytic methodology, and discussesthe major components of the analysis: the Engineering Analysis, the ManufacturerAnalysis, and the Impact Analysis which includes the Consumer Analysis.The section also discusses the interrelationships among the componentswhich ensure consistency throughout the analysis.A later discussion, Impact Models, Data and Assumptions, describes thecomputer models used in the analysis. The models predict the response ofconsumers, manufacturers, and utilities to future changes in the economy,including the imposition of energy conservation standards. Quantitativeestimates of the impacts of standards will be calculated from the outputsfrom the models. The models that will be utilized in the analysis are:andbullet; Engineering Performance Models. andbullet; Consumer Impact Models. andbullet; Manufacturer Impact Models. andbullet; Utility Impact Model.The function, data sources, assumptions and validity of the results foreach model are discussed below.The impact of appliance conservation standards will be determined by comparingprojections under the base case,\4\<NOTE/> with the projections under potential standards. These projectionswill first be made for a base case by use of the analytic models describedbelow. The calculations will then be repeated imposing the potential standardlevels.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The base case assumes implementation of the conservationstandards that were set by the Act.The differences between the projections of the energy consumption and economicvariables in the base and standards cases provide quantitative estimatesof the impacts of the standards. To evaluate the significance of the differences,a sensitivity analysis will be performed on the key parameters and assumptions.The economic analysis will be performed in the following areas: andbullet; An Engineering Analysis, which establishes the technical feasibilityand product attributes including costs of design options to improve applianceefficiency. andbullet; A Manufacturer Analysis, which provides an estimate of manufacturers'response to the proposed standards. Their response is quantified by changesin several financial performance measures. andbullet; A Consumer Analysis, which forecasts appliance sales, efficiencies,energy use, and consumer expenditures. andbullet; A separate Life-Cycle Cost Analysis to evaluate the savings inoperating expenses relative to increases in purchase price.andbullet; A Utility Analysis that measures the impacts of the altered energy-consumptionpatterns on electric utilities. andbullet; An Industry Impact Analysis that provides the financial and competitiveimpacts on the appliance industry. andbullet; A Cost-Benefit Analysis that collects the results of all the analysesinto the net benefits and costs from a national perspective. Each analysis area will be performed for each of the three products underconsideration. The results of the Engineering Analysis will be reviewedby DOE to determine whether standards for each product could yield measurableenergy savings. If standards would not yield energy savings, for example,if there is no combination of design options that would result in improvedproduct efficiency, the analysis will be terminated. If energy savingsare possible, then a detailed analysis is performed. For dishwashers, clotheswashers and clothes dryers, the analysis will be performed for a base caseplus three levels of standards. The levels to be analyzed will be selectedafter the Engineering Analysis is completed and reviewed. There is interaction among the Engineering, Consumer, Utility and ManufacturerAnalyses. The Engineering Analysis establishes appliance designs and relatedattributes such as efficiency and costs. Based on the relationships betweenthe prices and efficiencies of design options, the Consumer Analysis forecastssales and efficiencies of new and replacement appliances. These data areused as inputs to the Manufacturer Analysis, which uses them to determinethe financial impacts on prototypical firms within the industry. The ConsumerAnalysis also forecasts energy savings and consumer expenditures on thepurchase and operation of the appliances. Consumer expenditures (both purchaseand operation) are employed in the Life-Cycle Cost Analysis to determineconsumer impacts. Changes in sales, revenues, investments, and marginalcosts of utilities are calculated from the energy savings in the UtilityAnalysis. Three periods of time are considered by the analysis. First, the analysisextends over a time period that is consistent with the lifetimes of eachof the products. Second, the Manufacturer Analysis is performed for a typicalyear after the standards have been imposed. The typical year selected isthe fifth, by which time all major impacts of a standard would have occurred.Third, the Engineering Analysis examines the technical feasibility of improvingthe efficiency of the covered products before the standards are effective_withinthe next three to five years. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Models, Data and Assumptions </ITAG>a. Engineering Performance Models and Costing Analysis The Engineering Analysis addresses two statutory requirements. The firstrequirement is the Department's evaluation of the maximum improvementsin energy efficiency that are technologically feasible. The second relatesto the lessening of utility to the consumer of any of the covered productsdue to the imposition of standards. In addition, the Engineering Analysisprovides information on efficiencies, manufacturing costs, and applianceprices to other components of the overall analysis. The features of appliances that provide utility to the consumer are incorporatedinto the analysis through the creation of appliance classes. Classes area subset of appliance types. For example, clothes washers comprise an appliancetype, while front-loading washers comprise an appliance class. The EngineeringAnalysis develops cost and efficiency data for a set of design optionswithin each appliance class. These data are the output of the engineeringperformance models and costing analysis discussed in subsections 5-9, below.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Appliance Classes </ITAG>The first step in the Engineering Analysis is to segregate product typesinto separate classes to which different energy conservation standardsapply. Classes are differentiated by the type of energy use (oil, naturalgas or electricity), or capacity or performance-related features that provideutility to the consumer and affect efficiency. Classes are differentiatedin order to ensure that consumer products having different capacities orother performance-related features affecting efficiency and utility remainavailable to consumers. For each of the three appliances, the following are the classes that theDepartment plans to review. DOE welcomes comments, in response to today'snotice, on whether additional classes are needed.<T3>(i) Dishwashers. </T3>The following are the classes of dishwashersthat the Department is proposing to examine:<ITAG tagnum="25">Compact Dishwasher </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Standard Dishwasher </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Water Heating Dishwasher, Compact (115V) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Water Heating Dishwasher, Standard (115V) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Water Heating Dishwasher, Compact (230V) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Water Heating Dishwasher, Standard (230V)</ITAG>Compact dishwashers use less water and energy than standard size dishwashers.While standard size dishwashers have an exterior width greater than orequal to 22 inches, compacts have an exterior width less than 22 inches.4A<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>4A These definitions of ``standard'' and ``compact'' differfrom the definitions in the Federal Trade Commission's Appliance LabelingRegulations, where a ``standard'' size dishwasher is defined as one capableof cleaning 8 place-settings at a time. Therefore, some dishwashers thatthe FTC classifies as ``standard'' would be classified as ``compact'' bythese proposed classes. Water-heating dishwashers have the ability to heat incoming hot water.Water-heating dishwashers allow for a lower inlet water temperature sincethey can operate at that temperature by providing internal water heatingin at least one wash phase. <T3>(ii) Clothes Washers. </T3>Six classes of clothes washers are specifiedin this notice. These are:<ITAG tagnum="25">Front Loading </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Suds Savers </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Top Loading, Compact </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Top Loading, Standard </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Top Loading, Large </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Top Loading, Semi Automatic</ITAG>Front loading washing machines use less water than top loaders; since mostof the energy used by a clothes washer is for heating water, front loaders,by using less water, consume less energy. On the other hand, top loadersspin the clothes dryer. Suds savers can reuse suds and warm water froman earlier wash by pumping them back into the washer; therefore, less energyis used since less water is heated. The Department is planning to divide top loading washers into three classesby capacity: compact (1.6 cubic feet, or less), standard capacity (1.6to 2.59 cubic feet), and large capacity (2.6 cubic feet, or greater) sincethe size of the unit affects the amount of water used and, in turn, theamount of energy used. In addition, a separate class for semi-automaticclothes washers is specified, since the Department has estimated higherhot and warm water usage for semi-automatic than for fully automatic clotheswashers. <T3>(iii) Clothes Dryers. </T3>Five classes of clothes dryers are specifiedin this notice. These are:<ITAG tagnum="25">Electric, Standard </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Electric, Compact (120V) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Electric, Compact (240V) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Gas, Standard </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Gas, Compact</ITAG>These classes are distinguished by different energy sources and by performance-relatedfeatures. Gas and electricity are the energy sources. The performance-relatedfeatures include drum capacity and application voltage. Class distinctions were considered based on the type of control used toend the drying cycle but are not being proposed. The three types of controlsystems are: (1) a present time control, (2) an automatic temperature-sensingcontrol, and (3) an automatic moisture-sensing control. The energy efficiencyfor a dryer is related to these controls. However, product classes basedon these controls were not established because: (1) the test procedureaccounts for effects of controls with a field use factor, which gives efficiency``credits'' for automatic controls; and, (2) the Department does not believethat automatic controls provide utility to the consumer. Product classes were established for electric dryers based on drum capacityand application voltage. The test procedures specify two sizes of drumcapacity. These are: (1) compact, electric dryers with a drum capacityof less than 4.4 cubic feet and (2) standard electric dryers with a drumcapacity of 4.4 cubic feet or more. The compact dryers tend to be lessenergy-efficient than the standard dryers. Also, since compact dryers provideutility_they are suitable for small spaces_a separate class was establishedfor them. Separate product classes were established for compact electric dryers,based on appliance voltage. The 120-volt dryer tends to dry clothes atlower temperatures and for longer time periods than the 240-volt dryer.In general, the 240-volt dryer is less energy-efficient, because, by operatingat higher temperatures (even for shorter time periods), it consumes moreenergy per load. Many consumers feel that the 120-volt dryer has utilitybecause it can be installed anywhere, while the 240-volt dryer must benear a 240-volt outlet. Since the 240-volt compact electric dryer is lessenergy-efficient and provides utility to consumers, a separate productclass was established for it. A clothes dryer's efficiency is related to its drum capacity. Larger drumshave a higher thermal capacity and, therefore, require more energy to reacha desired temperature than do smaller drums. Since the test procedure usesa fixed load size, independent of drum size, larger capacity dryers usemore energy per pound of clothes, as measured by the test procedure. Inaddition, the air flow through the tumbling clothes is affected by theratio of the load size to the drum size. If small loads are used in largedrums, the air tends to bypass the clothes, increasing the energy requiredto dry the test loads. Using the same test load for all sizes of standarddryers means smaller capacity standard dryers have higher energy efficiency(as measured by the test procedure) than large capacity standard dryers.Relationships between efficiency and capacity were derived from data submittedby individual manufacturers. Testimony submitted by industry on the June1980 proposal indicated that gas units would have the same relationshipbetween efficiency and capacity as electric ones do. Data from these sourcesall indicated a distinct negative relationship between capacity and efficiencyfor standard size electric units; that is, the larger the drum size, thelower the efficiency. The same relationship was assumed for electric andgas units. For compact units, the available data were inconclusive aboutthe relationship between efficiency and capacity. In some cases, as capacityincreased, efficiency increased; in other cases, the opposite relationshipexisted. In any case, the extent of the relationship was small. Therefore,the standard for compact dryers was assumed to be independent of capacity.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Baseline Units </ITAG>For the purpose of generating a cost/efficiency relationship the EngineeringAnalysis needs to define a starting point or baseline. The EngineeringAnalysis uses information gathered from trade organizations, manufacturers,and consultants with expertise in specific product types to select a baselineunit. In past analyses a baseline unit represents a typical model withinan appliance class sold during the base year of the analysis. For thisanalysis, DOE intends to use the same baseline units as in the April 1982(for clothes dryers) and April 1985 (for dishwashers and clothes washers)proposals.\5\<NOTE/> Once identified, each baseline unit is characterized by itsefficiency-related design options.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ See Consumer Products Efficiency Standards EngineeringAnalysis Document, March 1982, DOE/CE-0030 and Technical Support DocumentEnergy Use Projections for Four Consumer Products, DOE/CS/20315-1, March1985. <ITAG tagnum="81">3.

LBL Residential Energy Model (LBL-REM) Early energy demand modeling focused on engineering estimates or on therelationship between energy consumption and economic growth. In the 1970's,Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) developed the first model to integratethese two important aspects, the Engineering-Economic Model of ResidentialEnergy Use (ORNL Model). That model was brought to Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory(LBL) in 1979, and adapted to the analysis of Federal appliance efficiencystandards. The ORNL Model used in the earlier rulemakings has been documentedin the Consumer Products Efficiency Standards Economic Analysis Document,DOE/CE-029, March 1982. The ORNL Model has been updated by LBL, resultingin the LBL Residential Energy Model (LBL-REM) which is summarized below.The LBL-REM forecasts the appliance purchase choices that households make,as well as their subsequent appliance usage behavior and energy consumption.The model uses engineering estimates of the characteristics of particulardesigns of appliances, and calculates the national impacts of a technology-specificpolicy on the populations of appliances used in the households. The engineeringdata provide alternative designs, characterized by purchase price and efficiency,that are available for purchase. The output from the LBL-REM satisfiesthe legislative requirements regarding energy savings and consumer economicimpacts (operating expenses and life-cycle costs).Engineering, economic, and demographic data are used in the LBL-REM. Theengineering data for appliances are described above. Additional data includeengineering data regarding alternative building shell construction measuresand costs, unit energy consumption and efficiency of existing appliances,age distribution of existing appliance stock, and retirement functions.Economic data includes projected energy price \8\<NOTE/> and household income, and models of energy investment, appliancepurchase and usage behavior, including fuel and technology choice for eachend-use. Demographic data includes number of households by type, projectedhousing starts and demolitions, and initial appliance holdings.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The projections of energy prices will be taken from themost recent <T3>Annual Energy Outlook, </T3>a publication of the Department's EnergyInformation Administration. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Structure </ITAG>The LBL-REM segments annual energy consumption into house types, end-uses,and fuel types. The house types are single family, multifamily, and mobilehomes. Calculations are performed separately for existing and new housingconstruction each year over the period, 1980-2015. The end-uses are spaceheating (including room and central), air conditioning, water heating,refrigeration, freezing, cooking, clothes drying, lighting, and miscellaneous.Up to four fuels are considered, as appropriate to each end-use: electricity,natural gas, heating oil, and LPG. The model exists in two versions: national(one region), and regional (10 Federal regions). Since usage of these appliancesis not likely to differ by geographic location, the national version willbe utilized in this analysis. The model projects five types of activities: technology/fuel choice; buildingshell thermal integrity choice; appliance efficiency choice; usage behavior;and turnover of buildings and appliances. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Housing Stock Submodel </ITAG>This submodel prepares data about housing stock projections for the LBL-REM.The number of occupied households, by type, is taken from the 1980 Censusesof Population and Housing. An exogenous projection of housing starts isobtained and estimates of projected demolition rates by house type arecalculated, assuming an exponential function. The housing submodel determinesthe projected housing stock each year, 1981-2015, by subtracting demolitionsfrom existing stock, then adding starts. The annual demolition rates byhouse type will be calculated for single family, multifamily, and mobilehomes, respectively. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Efficiency Choice Algorithm </ITAG>For dishwashers, clothes washers, and clothes dryers, historical efficiencydata are available for selected years for each class of appliance through1985. The Federal energy conservation standards for new units of theseappliances were met in 1988. After 1988, future efficiency improvementsare assumed to be a function of designs available (according to the engineeringanalysis) and of relevant energy prices. DOE believes the forecasting algorithmis designed to allow annual shipment-weighted efficiency factors (SWEFs)to increase if either more efficient designs become available at lowerprices, or energy prices increase. Conversely, if energy prices decrease,the SWEF may decline, but would have a lower bound at the 1988 Federalstandard level. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Thermal Integrity </ITAG>The projection of the level of investment in thermal integrity measuresin new houses is based on a life-cycle cost calculation, analogous to thatdone for equipment efficiencies.\9\<NOTE/> Estimates of the incremental costs of thermal integrity measuresare used in conjunction with current fuel prices and a discount rate.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The equipment efficiency and thermal integrity decisionsare not solved simultaneously, but recursively. The previous year's thermalintegrity is assumed in projecting this year's equipment efficiency; thenthis year's equipment efficiency is used to calculate this year's thermalintegrity. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Modeling Efficiency Standards </ITAG>The LBL-REM projects the average efficiency of new products, for example,dishwashers, purchased each year, in the absence of additional Federalregulations. A distribution of efficiencies is constructed around the average,based on efficiency distributions observed in the marketplace. This informationincludes information from industry sources, published data from the industrytrade associations and industry-wide data obtained from Form CS-179.\10\<NOTE/> A new Federal standard level would eliminate part of thedistribution; therefore, a new distribution is constructed. The new shipment-weightedaverage efficiency then characterizes the efficiency of new units in thatyear. The same process is applied to all years after implementation ofthe standard. The model is then run again, for the standards case, withthe adjusted average efficiencies, to calculate any changes in market shares,usage behavior, or investment in building shell thermal improvements thatmay occur due to standards, and to calculate the net energy savings. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Survey of Consumer Product Manufacturers through TradeAssociations in 1979. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Turnover of Appliance Stocks </ITAG>The initial age distribution of appliances in stock is characterized basedon industry data about historical annual shipments. The fraction of eachproduct that retires each year is based on the number of years since purchaseof the product. For each year's purchase the model associates an averageefficiency, so that when older appliances are retired, they are also recognizedas less efficient.\11\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ See Consumer Products Efficiency Standards Economic AnalysisDocument, DOE/CE-0029, March 1982, pp. 412-13. The number of potential purchasers of an appliance in new homes is equalto the number of new homes constructed each year. The number of potentialpurchasers of appliances in existing houses is equal to the number of retiringappliances, plus some fraction of those households that did not previouslyown the product.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Calculation of Market Shares </ITAG>Potential purchasers may purchase any competing technology within an end-use,or none. For example, for dishwashers, the decision to purchase or notis modeled, and the fraction of the total that chooses each class, e.g.,compact, is specified exogenously. For dishwashers, long-term market shareelasticities have been estimated with respect to equipment price, operatingexpense, and income respectively. The effect of standards is expected tobe lower operating expense and increased equipment price. The percentagechanges in these quantities are used, together with market share elasticities,to determine changes in market share resulting from standards. The modelassumes that higher equipment cost will decrease market shares, while loweroperating expense will increase market shares. The net result (predictedmarket share) depends on the standard level selected, and associated equipmentprice and operating expense. <ITAG tagnum="81">8. Usage Behavior </ITAG>For some products, changing the operating expense results in changes inusage behavior. These changes are modeled using usage elasticities in operatingexpense and income. For dishwashers, clothes washers, and clothes dryers,we expect these elasticities to be at or near zero; usage behavior is notinfluenced by the cost of operating the appliance. The Department willappreciate any comments on this assumption. <ITAG tagnum="81">9. Energy Consumption Calculations </ITAG>The total energy consumption per house for each end-use and fuel by housetype and vintage (existing or new) is the product of the unit energy consumption(accounting for efficiency and capacity changes), and usage factor, e.g.,relative hours of full-load use for dishwashing. The corresponding energyconsumption for all households is the consumption per house times the numberof households of that type and vintage, times the fraction of those householdsowning that appliance. Aggregate energy consumption is obtained by summing intermediate results.For example, national electricity consumption for residential dishwashingin a particular year is the sum of house types and vintages of standardelectric dishwashers, compact ones, and the various classes of water-heatingdishwashers. National residential electricity consumption in that yearis the sum of all end-uses of electricity consumption in the residentialsector. <ITAG tagnum="81">10. Model Outputs </ITAG>The principal outputs from the LBL-REM for each year are: andbullet; Energy consumption by end-use and fuel. andbullet; Per unit equipment price and operating expense by product. andbullet; Total residential energy consumption by fuel. andbullet; Projected annual shipments of residential appliances. andbullet; Differences in these quantities between a base and a standardscase. These outputs are provided annually (or for selected years) and cumulativelyover a period of time, e.g., 1990-2015. Energy savings are provided annuallyfrom implementation of standards to the end of the period. Net presentvalue of standards is evaluated for each regulated product, and for theend-use(s) comprising the regulated and competing products. Energy savings are calculated as the difference in energy consumption betweenthe base case and standards case. Energy consumption in both the base caseand standards case includes building shell improvements, changes in fuelchoice, or changes in usage behavior. Therefore, the energy savings capturethe net energy savings due to regulation, including the effects inducedby shifts in market share or changes in usage behavior. Net present value, on the other hand, excludes these types of effects.\12\<NOTE/> Net present value is calculated from per unit changes inequipment and operating costs, multiplied by base case shipments. If thenet present value were calculated without normalizing to base case shipments,erroneous results would be obtained: if standards caused decreased purchasesof a product, this would appear an economic benefit, namely less moneyspent on purchasing and using appliances; \13\<NOTE/> and if standards resulted in increased purchases, this wouldbe incorrectly counted as a cost, when it reflects consumers' preferencefor the post-standards product. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Present value is the discounted total value of energyconsumption during the appliances' lifetimes, plus the discounted equipmentcosts for those appliances that are purchased during those periods, atalternative standards levels. The difference between each of the two casesis the net present value (NPV) attributable to standards (or amended standards).A positive NPV for an appliance at a given standard level indicates that,if that standard were adopted, consumers of that appliance as a whole wouldsave that much more money in fuel costs, discounted to the present, thanthey would pay in increased first cost for a more efficient appliance,discounted to the present, compared to the base case.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ Without normalization, the greatest economic benefitwould be obtained by a standard level that resulted in no future purchasesof the product. Then no money would be spent on purchasing the product,or on operating expenses, and the value of the savings would equal theamount of money that would have been spent without the standard. This wouldclearly be a misrepresentation of the net present value of standards. Base case usage is assumed in calculating the net present value, sinceany ``rebound effect'' \14\<NOTE/> reflects the consumer's judgment that increased usage isworth more than the direct energy savings associated with keeping usageconstant. Therefore, deduction of any foregone energy savings resultingfrom a possible ``rebound effect'' prior to calculating the net presentvalue, would result in an underestimate of the true net present value associatedwith a given efficiency improvement. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ The ``rebound effect'' is the projected energy savings(from an efficiency improvement) that does not occur. This results whenpurchasers of more energy efficient appliances use them more intensively,thereby saving less energy than the engineering estimates would have indicated.Empirical studies indicate that approximately 15 percent of the potentialenergy savings is thus not achieved. Therefore, in calculating energy savings,the LBL-REM assumes that only 85 percent of the savings that are indicatedby engineering estimates will actually be achieved.<ITAG tagnum="81">11. Other Consumer Impacts </ITAG>One measure of the effect of standards on consumers is the change in operatingcost as compared to the change in purchase price. This is quantified bythe difference in life-cycle cost between the base and standards case forthe appliance classes analyzed. The LCC is the sum of the purchase priceand the operating cost discounted over the lifetime of the appliance. Itwill be calculated at the average efficiency for each class in the yearstandards are imposed using consumer discount rates of five, seven, andten percent. The purchase cost is based on the factory costs in the EngineeringAnalysis and includes a factory markup plus a distributor and retailermarkup. The operating cost is calculated from the unit energy consumptionderived in the Engineering Analysis adjusted for differences in usage,i.e., operating load hours, between the test procedure and the LBL ResidentialEnergy Model. Projected energy efficiencies and usages are taken from theresults of LBL-REM. Two other measures of economic impact are useful in evaluating the impactson consumers. The payback period measures the amount of time it takes torecover, through lower operating costs, the additional expenditure on increasedefficiency. Numerically, it is the ratio of the increase in first costbetween the base and standards cases to the decrease in annual operatingcosts. Both the numerator and denominator of this expression are evaluatedat the average efficiency in the year standards come into effect and atthe energy prices in that year. The cost of conserved energy is the increasein first cost amortized over the lifetime of the appliance at the consumerdiscount rate divided by the annual energy savings. The consumer will benefitwhenever the cost of conserved energy is less than the price of energyfor that end use. c. Manufacturer Impact Models <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Conceptual Approach </ITAG>The Manufacturer Impact Analysis estimates both the overall impact of newor amended standards on manufacturers as well as the distribution of effectsamong different manufacturers. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Measures of Impact </ITAG>The analysis examines three types of long-run impact: profitability; growth;and, competitiveness. To do this, three measures of impact are trackedfor the industry as a whole and for any segments that may exist. The threeimpact variables are: return-on-equity (ROE); assets; and labor. ROE provides the primary measure of profitability, although gross margin,return-on-assets (ROA), and return-on-sales (ROS) are also reported. Assetsand labor provide the measures of growth (positive or negative). The impacton competitiveness is analyzed by looking at the relative changes in growthand profitability for large and small firm segments. Two short-run impacts are also analyzed. First, the ability for the industryas a whole and for specific segments of the industry to provide the one-timeinvestments required to meet the new standard is examined. These expendituresare compared to available cash and to their historical variation. Second,if standards result in decreased sales for the particular industry beinganalyzed, the possibility of a price war in the time period when the industryis adjusting to a lower sales volume is examined. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. LBL Manufacturer Impact Model (LBL-MIM) </ITAG>In order to estimate the impacts of energy efficiency standards a computerspreadsheet model, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Manufacturer ImpactModel (LBL-MIM), was developed. The LBL-MIM uses a ``typical year'' approach rather than a dynamic approach.This approach models a ``typical year'' for the industry both in the modifiedstandards case and in the existing-standards case. The typical year chosenfor the model is the fifth year after the imposition of standards. Fiveyears is considered long enough to capture any major impacts from the standard,such as profitability changes or firm entry into or exit from the industry.Ideally, a manufacturer analysis should look at the impact of a proposedregulation on every firm that does business in the industry under question.However, because the industries being analyzed have many manufacturersmaking a particular product, a firm-by-firm analysis would be a very expensiveundertaking. In addition, the engineering and financial data for most manufacturingfirms are proprietary and are not routinely available for public analysis.Because of these limitations on data and resources, the analysis estimatesthe impact of the standards by using prototypical firms. A prototypical firm is a hypothetical firm representative of a particularportion of an industry. The goal of defining the prototypical firms isto characterize firm-to-firm variations in the industry as best as possible.Prototypical firms are defined in terms of parameters that have importancein determining the level of impact and are consistent with industry datafor that particular portion of the industry. Important parameters usedin the model include the cost and marketing strategies. An important simplifying assumption of the LBL-MIM is that each prototypicalfirm offers products to several different markets. The product offeringsare generally differentiated by using the product classes established bythe Act. Different markets are defined in terms of the technological characteristicsof the products, e.g., standard size or compact dishwashers. At times,this market segmentation plays an important role in determining a firm'sprofits. Generally, appliance manufacturers are thought to be able to chargedifferent markups for different products. Firms are able to charge highermarkups on products that have desirable characteristics. Products on thelow end of this spectrum are generally bought in larger quantities at lowerprices by consumers who are more highly price conscious, and thus the markupsfor these products are lower. The per unit profits made by manufacturersfor these different products may differ significantly. The model incorporatesthis market reality by allowing firms to charge different markups on differentproducts. The model sets product prices in the modified standards case in two stages.In the first stage the price is computed by assuming that the industry'sgross margin remains unchanged under the new standards. This is the pricingrule most often referred to by the industry. Stage two drops the assumption of a constant gross margin, and insteadassumes that firms face a downward sloping demand curve and set price tomaximize profit. Economic theory states that this is done by setting priceequal to the long-run marginal cost (LMC) times a markup that depends onlyon the elasticity of the demand curve. Stage two begins by dividing costsinto long-run fixed costs and LMC, and then estimating the firm's markup.Before using the markup, a new LMC is computed which includes any additionalunit variable costs and the variable part of levelized capital and engineeringcosts. Once the new LMC is computed, this figure is multiplied by the markupfactor to determine the new price.A change in standard level affects the analysis in three distinct ways.Increased levels of standards will require additional investment, willraise production costs, and will affect revenue both through price anddemand. The most obvious investment induced by standards is the purchase of newplant and equipment. This cost first is evaluated from engineering data,and then averaged by taking into account the life of the investment, thedate on which it is made, tax laws, and the appropriate cost of funds.An additional and sometimes larger investment takes place as the old inventoryis replaced with more expensive new units. The model assumes previous inventoryratios are maintained. A third form of investment tracked by the modelis the change in the transactions demand for cash that accompanies a changein revenues. Increased costs of production are modeled by coupling engineering dataon changes in unit costs caused by standards with data from LBL-REM onthe marketplace demand of the product. Revenue is affected by both price and shipments. Price is computed fromcosts in two stages. First, a constant gross margin pricing rule is used.Then a markup over long-term marginal costs is computed and used to determinean optimal price. Demand is determined by measured price and operatingcost elasticities, coupled with the changes in price and operating costsresulting from the standards. The LBL-MIM produces several outputs used in analyzing the impact of standardson manufacturers. A simplified pro forma income statement is prepared foreach prototypical firm. In addition to the income statement, the outputspresent four measures of performance: gross margin, return on sales, returnon total assets, and return on equity. The results are presented for thewithout-standards case and the with-standards case, and the relative differencebetween the two is also given. Another output table analyzes the sourceof changes in income, expenses, and assets from an economic point of view,while a third output table analyzes price and profitability changes underthe two pricing scenarios mentioned above. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Data Sources </ITAG>The LBL-MIM needs data that characterize both a particular industry andprototypical firms within that industry. Estimates of data are based oninformation from five general sources: LBL business consultation groups;the Engineering Analysis; the Consumer Analysis, public financial data;and industry profiles. <ITAG tagnum="81">d. Utility Impact Model </ITAG>The Utility Analysis serves several purposes within the overall assessmentof the impact of the proposed standards. It contributes to quantifyingthe energy savings by determining the reduction in fossil fuels used forelectricity generation. The reduction in fossil fuel consumption is alsoan input to the Environmental Assessment. By calculating utility avoidedcosts, this area of the analysis provides marginal electricity costs tobe used in evaluating the societal benefits of standards. Finally, it examinesthe impacts on the electric utility industry in terms of changes in investment,revenue requirements, the need for new generating capacity, and residentialload factors. The Utility Analysis adopts the standard convention that the value of electricitysavings can be broken down into energy (or marginal cost) savings and capacity(or reliability) savings. The energy impact measures the production costsavoided by reduced electrical demands, valued at the marginal energy costsof the utility. The capacity impact measures the reliability value of reducedloads during system peak periods, which is, by convention, valued at thecost of a combustion turbine that would have been needed to meet the load.The analysis characterizes these avoided costs per kWh of heating, cooling,and baseload energy saved.\15\<NOTE/> These values are used to calculate societal benefits fromreduced electricity consumption.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ For the purposes of calculating utility avoided costs,electric heating appliances are defined as electric heat pumps and electricresistance heat, cooling appliances are defined as room and central airconditioners plus heat pumps, and baseload appliances are defined as allother appliances. The utility impact model calculates avoided energy costs based on a disaggregationof the generation fuel mix to the National Electric Reliability Council(NERC) regions and a simplified load duration curve for each region. First,the model allocates national electricity savings that are forecasted bythe LBL-REM to NERC regions in proportion to their current consumptionof heating, cooling, and baseload energy. The regional proportions arederived from data on regional appliance saturations, efficiencies, andhours of use. The fraction of the electricity that would have to be generatedat the margin from oil and gas is calculated from the total regional oiland gas fraction and the simplified load duration curve. Projected utilitynatural gas and coal prices, weighted by the oil and gas fraction and thenon-oil and gas fraction respectively, are used to calculate utility marginalcosts over the forecast period. The marginal costs are adjusted to accountfor seasonal differences. The avoided capacity cost calculation in the model is based on conservationload factors (CLFs) for the energy savings attributable to the standards,as well as the capacity value of a combustion turbine. A conservation loadfactor is defined as the average hourly energy savings of a conservationmeasure divided by its peak load savings. The CLFs are a way of characterizingthe peak demand savings of a conservation measure. They are used to convertthe capacity value of the standards into the per kWh values described above.The NERC forecasts of capacity requirements for each region are used toaccount for regional variations in reserve margin. If NERC forecasts anadequate reserve margin in a region for a given year, no reliability valueis given to the capacity savings in the region.The inputs needed for the utility impact model are conservation load factors,state-level utility fuel prices, appliance saturations, efficiencies, andhours of use, as well as electricity generation by fuel type and capacityneed by NERC region. The outputs of the analysis are the fuel savings,the reduction in the need for new generating capacity, and the avoidedenergy and capacity costs for heating, cooling, and baseload appliancesper million Btu of resource energy. These marginal costs are used to calculatesocietal costs and benefits of standards. <ITAG tagnum="81">e. Sensitivity Analyses </ITAG>Sensitivity studies are performed to determine how changes in technicaland operational parameters affect key engineering and economic indicatorsused in evaluation of appliance standards. This makes it possible to placelimits on the overall results of the analysis and to gain an understandingof which variables are most important in producing these results. Sensitivityanalyses are developed in a series of distinct steps. For each componentanalysis in the overall analysis, critical input parameters are identifiedand reasonable ranges of variation determined. The sensitivity of the modelto changes in the value of each important parameter is then estimated byrunning the model for both the base case and the standards cases. The resultsof the sensitivity analyses are examined to determine the sensitivity ofthe forecasts to exogenous variables and assumptions and the sensitivityof the differences between the base and standards cases (impacts of alternativestandards). <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Comments </ITAG>a. Questions for Public Comment DOE is interested in receiving comments and data concerning the accuracyand workability of this methodology. Also, DOE welcomes discussion on improvementsor alternatives to this approach. In particular, DOE is interested in gatheringdata on the incremental costs of improving the energy efficiency of dishwashers,clothes washers, and clothes dryers. The design options listed above canbe used as a starting point; however, data for additional design optionswould be welcome. While the Department has been unable to identify any small manufacturers,nevertheless, for purposes of this analysis, small manufacturers' costsare assumed to equal those of medium manufacturers. The Department is especiallyinterested in learning of the existence of such manufacturers, and in obtainingcosting data from small manufacturers of the products under consideration.For the LBL Residential Energy Model, DOL requests interested parties toprovide historical data on shipments and average efficiencies by classfor the products subject to the proposed rulemaking. Data on consumer prices,and on the installation and maintenance costs of these appliances are alsorequested. The manufacturer analysis needs the financial data from the product divisionlevel, i.e., dishwashers, clothes washers, and clothes dryers. All of thesedata are available at the firm level, but firms are typically much largerthan the relevant division, and thus firm data may give a misleading indicationof the division's finances. An income statement and balance sheet at the division level would be mosthelpful. If this is not available, then data on the following variablesare considered most essential: net income, revenue, selling and generaland administrative expenses, engineering expenses, cost of goods sold,interest, taxes, debt-to-equity ratio, net depreciable assets, net assets,capital investment, and long-term debt. The Department also would welcome current data on unit sales and revenuefor the industries as a whole. b. Comment Procedure Interested persons are invited to submit written comments to DOE.
