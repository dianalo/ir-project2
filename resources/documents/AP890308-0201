The state network bowed to a furious campaign by residents insoutheast London and picturesque Kent, who said demolition along the68-mile route and the noise of trains would devastate their lives.   The changes will increase the cost of the rail link project from$2 billion to $2.9 billion, British Rail said.   The route won't be ready until the late 1990s, so existingrailway tracks and lower speeds on the England side will have to beused when the Channel Tunnel now being built to link England andFrance opens in 1993.</TEXT></DOC>
