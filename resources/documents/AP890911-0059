A congressional investigation has found numerous irregularitiesat the Department of Housing and Urban Development under Pierce,including political favoritism in awarding of contracts andembezzlement by real estate agents.   The former HUD secretary said in this week's Time magazine: ``Norequest was to be given any special advantage because it wassubmitted by a Republican. ... My decisions were based on facts, lawand logic, not on political party.''   During his tenure, Pierce was known as ``Silent Sam,'' theinvisible man of the Reagan Cabinet who preferred to sit in hisoffice and watch television.   But Pierce said, ``Such characterizations are lopsided. Theydisregard the assignment President Reagan gave me _ to reduce thesize and the cost of government while helping the most needy _ andthey bypass my achievements.''   Among other things, Congress has found that GOP consultants werepaid hundreds of thousands of dollars to win contracts forwell-connected developers.   While Pierce said he never intervened in the awarding oflucrative contracts, he acknowledged writing memos to his stafftelling them to give ``careful consideration'' to certain projects,Time reported.   In a related matter, The New York Times reported today thatPierce ordered broad financial concessions for a luxury apartmentcomplex in Chicago despite the objections of a senior federalhousing official.   The official, the newspaper reported, became so concerned aboutthe $23 million deal that he refused to sign mortgage documents.   Documents indicate that Pierce issued the 1987 order after theintervention on the project's behalf by a White House official, twomembers of Congress, a former secretary of defense and theUniversity of Chicago, the Times said.   Thomas T. Demery, former assistant secretary of housing, told theTimes that he felt the concession provided to the owner of theRegents Park apartments ``were unfair to the taxpayer.''   The apartment complex was built in the 1970s with nearly $26million in federally insured mortgages, the Times reported. When theoriginal owners had financial problems, the title was transferred toBruce E. Clinton, who made extensive repairs under an agreement thatreduced the mortgage payments due to HUD, the paper said.   Demery told the Times that he didn't think the concessions werenecessary.</TEXT></DOC>
