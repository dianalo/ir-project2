(b) Financial institutions shall be established on DoD installations onlyafter approval by the appropriate regulatory agency and the DoD Componentconcerned. (1) Independent or branch banks, full-service credit unions, and savingsassociations are the preferred sources of on-base service at domestic installations.(2) Banking facilities shall be established on DoD installations only whena demonstrated and justified need cannot be met through other means. Normally,banking facilities shall be used only at overseas locations and in Statesthat prohibit branch banking. In times of mobilization, it may become necessaryto designate additional banking facilities as an emergency measure. Uponrecommendation by a DoD Component, banking facilities are designated bythe Treasury Department under 12 U.S.C. 265.

(1) Each on-base financial institution is encouraged to offer ATM servicewith network connectivity. Proposals to install ATMs from on-base financialinstitutions shall be considered under provisions stated in DoD Instructions1000.10 and 1000.12.

If the existing ATM(s) does not provide network connectivity,the on-base financial institution shall be given up to 6 months to providesuch connectivity. (iii) If ATM service is unavailable or if existing on-base ATM servicedoes not provide network connectivity within the 6-month period, the installationcommander may seek ATM service with network connectivity from another financialinstitution.

(g) The termination of operations by an on-base financial institution shallbe initiated by a DoD Component only under one of the following conditions:(1) The mission of the installation has changed, or is scheduled to bechanged, thereby eliminating or substantially reducing the requirementfor financial services.(2) Active military operations prevent continuation of on-base financialservices.(3) The performance of the financial institution in providing servicesis not satisfactory according to standards ordinarily associated with thefinancial services industry or is inconsistent with the procedures prescribedin DoD Instructions 1000.10 and 1000.12. Termination actions begun on thebasis of inadequate performance shall be substantiated by sufficient evidence.Such actions shall be coordinated with the appropriate regulatory agencyand the Comptroller of the Department of Defense before being carried out.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 231.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Responsibilities. </ITAG>(a) The <T3>Comptroller of the Department of Defense</T3> (C, DoD) shall: (1) Develop and monitor policies and procedures governing establishment,operation, and termination of financial institutions on DoD installations.(2) Monitor industry trends, conduct studies and surveys, and facilitateappropriate dialogues on banking and credit union arrangements and cost-benefitrelationships, coordinating as necessary with DoD Components, financialinstitutions, and trade associations.

The following guidelines govern application of DoD Directive 5400.11to those financial institutions that operate under this part: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Financial institutions and their branches and facilities operatingon DoD military installations do not fall within the purview of 5 U.S.C.552 et seq. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. These financial institutions do not fit the definition of ``agency''to which the Privacy Act applies: ``* * * any executive department, MilitaryDepartment, Government corporation, Government-controlled corporation,or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (includingthe Executive Office of the President), or an independent regulatory agency''(5 U.S.C. 552(e) and 552a(a)(1)). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Nor are they ``government contractors'' within the meaning of section552a(m) of reference (h), as they do not operate a system of records onbehalf of an agency ``* * * to accomplish an agency function.'' Accordingto the Office of Management and Budget Privacy Act Guidelines, the provisionrelating to Government contractors applies only to systems of records ``** * actually taking the place of a Federal system which, but for the contract,would have been performed by an agency and covered by the Privacy Act.''Clearly, the subject institutions do not meet these criteria. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Since the Act does not apply to them, these financial institutionsare not required to comply with section 552a(e)(3) of Title 5, United StatesCode, in obtaining and making use of personal information in their relationshipswith personnel authorized to use such institutions. Thus, these institutionsare not required to inform individuals from whom information is requestedof the authority for its solicitation, the principal purpose for whichit is intended to be used, the routine uses that may be made of it, orthe effects of not providing the information. There also is no requirementto post information of this nature within on-base banking and credit unionoffices. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The financial institutions concerned hold the same position andrelationship to their account holders, members, and to the Government asthey did before enactment under OMB Circular A-108. Within their usualbusiness relationships, they still are responsible for safeguarding theinformation provided by their account holders or members and for obtainingonly such information as is reasonable and necessary to conduct business.This includes credit information and proper identification, which may includesocial security number, as a precondition for the cashing of checks. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Financial institutions may incorporate the following conditionsof disclosure of personal identification in all contracts, including loanagreements, account signature cards, certificates of deposit agreements,and any other agreements signed by their account holders or members:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">I hereby authorize the Department of Defense and its various Componentsto verify my social security number or other identifier and disclose myhome address to authorized (name of financial institution) officials sothat they may contact me in connection with my business with (name of financialinstitution). All information furnished will be used solely in connectionwith my financial relationship with (name of financial institution).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">When the financial institution presents such signed authorizations,the Military Commands or installations shall provide the appropriate information.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Even though the agreement described in subsection A.3., above,has not been obtained, the Department of Defense may provide these financialinstitutions with salary information and, when pertinent, the length ortype of civilian or military appointment, consistent with DoD Directives5400.11 and 5400.7. Some examples of personal information pertaining toDoD personnel that can normally be released without creating an unwarrantedinvasion of personal privacy are name, rank, date of rank, salary, presentand past duty assignments, future assignments that have been finalized,office phone number, source of commission, and promotion sequence number.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. When DoD personnel with financial obligations are reassigned andfail to inform the financial institution of their whereabouts, they shouldbe located by contacting the individual's last known commander or supervisorat the official position or duty station within that particular DoD Component.That commander or supervisor shall either furnish the individual's newofficial duty location address to the financial institution, or shall forward,through official channels, any correspondence received pertaining theretoto the individual's new commander or supervisor for appropriate assistanceand response. Correspondence addressed to the individual conccrned at hisor her last official place of business or duty station shall be forwardedas provided by postal regulations to the new location, but the individualmay choose not to respond. However, once an individual's affiliation withthe Department of Defense is terminated through separation or retirement,the locator assistance the Department may render in the disclosure of homeaddress is severely curtailed unless the public interest dictates disclosureof the last known home address. The Department of Defense may, at its discretion,forward correspondence to the individual's last known home address. Theindividual may choose not to respond; and the Department may not act asan intermediary for private matters concerning former DoD personnel whoare no longer affiliated with it. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B.
