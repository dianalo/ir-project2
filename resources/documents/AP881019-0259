Saudi Arabia and other nations have been producing above theirquotas, jockeying for position in advance of the Thursday meetingin Madrid, Spain, and a gathering Nov. 21 in Vienna, Austria, ofall 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   The pickup in production has added to already plentiful worldsupplies and kept prices weak on the volatile oil market. Priceshave been seesawing in recent weeks between $12 and $16 a barrel,which is still well below OPEC's target of $18.   Over the weekend, Saudi Arabia and three other Arab members ofOPEC called on the cartel's members to restrain production but alsorecommended that OPEC boost its official output ceiling, excludingIraq, from about 15 million barrels a day to a minimum of 17.4million barrels.   The ceiling proposed by these Arab nations, members of the GulfCooperation Council, would include Iraq but would be well underOPEC's current total production of an estimated 21 million to 22million barrels a day.   Gignoux called the suggested cap ``not a workable number.''   Nick Antill, an oil analyst at the London brokerage CountyNatWest, described the outcome of the council talks as ``quitedepressing'' because no new production formula was offered.   As a result, he said, the Madrid meeting could end with the oilofficials sticking to the current production accord as part oftheir ``constant attempt to patch another hole in the dike.''   The council's proposal would make room for Iraq in the quotasystem, allotting it the same share of 2.4 million barrels a daynow held by former enemy Iran. Iraq in the past has refused tohonor its quota of 1.5 million barrels a day because it wantedparity with Iran.   Oil prices rose after the council's statement but retreated whenIran rejected any suggestion of parity with Iraq. Tehran radio saidsuch an idea was ``totally unprincipled.''   The Gulf Cooperation Council is comprised of six nations on thePersian Gulf. Four members, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,Kuwait and Qatar, also belong to OPEC. The other two nations, Omanand Bahrain, do not.   The council's discussions were considered important because ofthe influene wielded by Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oilexporter.   The Madrid talks, called as a joint meeting of two OPECcommittees, will bring officials of Iran and Iraq to their firstcartel meeting since an August cease-fire in their 8-year-old war.   Both Iran and Iraq want to export more oil to pay the hefty tabsof rebuilding their war-damaged economies.   Analysts estimate Iraq has been pumping at least 2.6 millionbarrels of crude a day, an amount that could soar to 3.7 millionbarrels in mid-1989 with completion of a new pipeline through SaudiArabia to the Red Sea.   Iran has been producing an estimated 2.5 million barrels dailyanalysts say.   Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia warned other nations it wouldcontinue producing more than its OPEC share unless other cartelmembers stuck to their limits. Analysts said the oil giant recentlyboosted production to as much as 5.6 million barrels a day, toppingits official quota of 4.3 million barrels.   The pricing committee, one of the two panels meeting in Madrid,is made up of Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Indonesia andVenezuela. The other panel, the long-term strategy committee,includes Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.   The remaining OPEC members are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar andthe United Arab Emirates.</TEXT></DOC>
