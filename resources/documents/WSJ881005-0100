Stewart and Bryan Burrough (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><G> SEC JUS </G><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a breakthrough for the government in its massive investigation of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., James Dahl, an important aide to Michael Milken, head of Drexel's high-yield bond operation, has agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors and recently testified before a federal grand jury.    Mr. Dahl, who received a target letter in September from the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office notifying him that he might be indicted in the Drexel case, has been granted immunity in return for his testimony. He thus becomes the first Drexel official to break ranks since the Securities and Exchange Commission filed its massive civil securities-fraud case against Drexel, Mr. Milken and others on Sept. 7.    Mr. Dahl, who wasn't named in the civil case, is also cooperating with the SEC in its continuing investigation of Drexel.    His cooperation could increase the pressure on other potential witnesses to cooperate, because, as the government's case is strengthened by additional witnesses, the opportunities diminish for others to get favorable treatment from the government.    Mr. Dahl's lawyer, Peter Fishbein, a partner at New York-based Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays andamp; Handler, confirmed that his client appeared before the grand jury hearing evidence in the Drexel case. He said that Mr. Dahl received a form of immunity guaranteeing that anything he tells the government won't be used against him.    Mr. Fishbein emphasized that Mr. Dahl didn't agree to plead guilty to any crime in return for immunity. That is in contrast to some others who have cooperated in the government's case, such as imprisoned takeover speculator Ivan F. Boesky. The government &quot;hasn't indicated in any way that (Mr. Dahl) committed any crime or violated any laws,&quot; Mr. Fishbein said.    A Drexel spokesman said, &quot;Counsel has advised us that immunity grants are not unusual in investigations of this sort.&quot; The spokesman said that Mr. Dahl was still employed by Drexel.    Working under Mr. Milken in Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., office, Mr. Dahl sells high-yield bonds, and is considered by some in the industry to be the firm's top &quot;junk bond&quot; salesman.    It isn't known what information Mr. Dahl has disclosed to the government. He is understood to have invoked the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when he was first called to testify before the grand jury. A person familiar with Drexel's Beverly Hills office, however, said that Mr. Dahl possesses a wealth of information about Mr. Milken; Mr. Milken's brother Lowell, also a Drexel official; and others who are targets of the grand jury probe. &quot;He sat three feet away from Mike for years,&quot; this person said.    According to people familiar with the investigation, the government used unusual-and tough-procedures to obtain Mr. Dahl's cooperation. After serving him with the target letter, it allowed Mr. Dahl to argue that he shouldn't be indicted, an effort that seemed to make headway with the U.S. attorney's office, the people said.    Then the U.S. attorney served Mr. Dahl with what is known as a compulsion order. Such an order requires a witness to testify before a grand jury. It deprives him of the right to invoke the Fifth Amendment, but also guarantees that the testimony can't be used to prosecute him.    A spokesman for the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office declined comment.    Defense lawyers say the rarely used procedure is a powerful incentive to obtain cooperation from a reluctant witness. If the witness refuses to testify, he can be jailed. If he lies, he can be prosecuted for perjury. On the other hand, the more the witness reveals, the broader is the grant of immunity.    As previously reported, target letters, which formally indicate prosecutors' intention to seek an indictment, were also sent to Michael and Lowell Milken; Cary Maultasch, a Drexel trader based in New York; and Bruce Newberg, a former Drexel trader. The letters gave the men a final opportunity to convince the government that charges shouldn't be filed.    In breaking ranks with other recipients of the target letters, Mr. Dahl also broke ranks with Williams andamp; Connolly, the Washington law firm that has played a key role in coordinating Drexel's defense. Mr. Dahl had been represented by Williams andamp; Connolly, one of the firms representing Mr. Milken. After he was first subpoenaed in the criminal investigation, Mr. Dahl also retained Kaye Scholer. Now Mr. Dahl has dropped Williams andamp; Connolly and is using only Kaye Scholer.    A Williams andamp; Connolly partner declined comment.    Last year Mr. Dahl figured in civil allegations by Staley Continental Inc. that Drexel attempted to &quot;extort&quot; the big food company into a takeover and manipulate its stock to thwart a stock offering. In a lawsuit filed in a Chicago federal court, Staley claimed that Mr. Dahl proposed a buy-out and then said &quot;it is very important for us to sit down and talk before you do something that hurts me and before I do something that hurts you.&quot; Drexel said the suit was &quot;totally without merit.&quot;    The suit was dropped last August after Drexel agreed to buy a commodities trading unit from Staley.    Staley was recently added by the SEC to the list of stocks being scrutinized in its investigation of Drexel. </TEXT></DOC>
