The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods _ itemsexpected to last three or more years _ dipped 0.6 percent to aseasonally adjusted $124.59 billion last month after a 1.1 percentdrop in September.   Analysts, who had been looking for an October decline, weresuprised by the sharp downward revision in September, a month whenthe government had earlier reported that orders posted a small 0.2percent increase.   The back-to-back monthly declines, coming on the heels of evenbigger decreases in July and May, were viewed as ominous for thehealth of the manufacturing sector.   ``The U.S. manufacturing sector is in a recession. Very fewindustries are hiring and most are laying off employees,'' saidJohn Hagens, chief economist for the WEFA Group, an economicforecasting company in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.   The open question, economists said, was whether the sluggishnessin manufacturing would spill over into the rest of the economy andspell an end to the economic recovery, which has already lasted apeacetime record of seven years.   Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, predicted thateconomic growth would dip below an annual rate of 1 percent in thefinal three months of this year and she said economic activitywould remain lackluster through the first half of 1990.   ``We are not forecasting a recession but we are forecastingmiserable growth. It is so close to the edge that the economy couldslip into negative growth,'' she said.   The last time the economy faced such an extended period ofweakness was in mid-1986 when U.S. manufacturers were battlingmassive imports and weak foreign sales. However, manufacturingrebounded in 1987 and 1988 as a declining dollar helped spur a boomin export sales.   Analysts said they were not looking for that to recur this time,in part because overseas growth in many countries is slowing.   ``There is very little on the horizon to revive manufacturingover the next six to nine months,'' said Allen Sinai, chiefeconomist of the Boston Co.   He said a slump in manufacturing, which accounts for 18 percentof U.S. jobs, would not be enough by itself to trigger a recession.But he said he was forecasting a mild slump next year because of abelief that services industries will see weak sales as well.   Much of the industrial slowdown so far has been in the autoindustry, where slumping sales have already prompted layoffs andproduction cutbacks.   For October, transportation orders rose by 3 percent to $33.54billion, recouping some of a giant 10.8 percent drop in September.But the strength was concentrated in increased demand for militaryships and civilian aircraft. Orders to automakers were down again.   Military orders fell by 12.4 percent to $9.33 billion. However,that followed a huge 33.9 percent military increase in September.   Excluding the volatile defense category, orders would have risen0.5 percent in October after posting a 3.5 percent decline inSeptember.   Orders in the key category of non-defense capital goods rose 3.2percent in October to $36.5 billion, but that was concentrated indemand for civilian aircraft and did nothing to dispell concernsthat this sector will weaken as businesses, facing a profitssqueeze, cut back on expansion plans.   Orders for the machinery category that includes computersdropped 4.6 percent to $21.53 billion, while the non-computermachinery category fell 3.8 percent to $20.16 billion.   Shipments of durable goods fell 1.7 percent to $122.4 billionafter a 3 percent decline in September.</TEXT></DOC>
