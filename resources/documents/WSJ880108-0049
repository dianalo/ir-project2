The company said it still could decide to aggressively expand the units, but a sale seemed more likely.    The announcement signals a coming consolidation in the specialty retailing industry, whose sales growth started slowing last summer. &quot;This would really be the first major announcement of a turnover in the ownership of a specialty retailer&quot; since then, said Carl Steidtmann, chief economist at the Management Horizons consulting unit of Price Waterhouse. &quot;I'm sure there will be more.&quot;    The move also marks the latest effort by Minneapolis-based General Mills to concentrate on its food operations. In 1985, the company shed a number of its non-food businesses. It spun off its toy businesses to create Kenner Parker Toys Inc. and its Izod and Ship 'n Shore fashion lines and Monet jewelry unit into Crystal Brands Inc. It also disposed of a crafts business, a wallpaper retailer and a chain of sportswear stores.    However, the decision to entertain buyers for Talbots and Eddie Bauer represents a turnabout for General Mills. At the September annual meeting, chairman H. Brewster Atwater Jr. outlined ambitious growth plans, including 15 to 20 new outlets and introduction of a children's line for Eddie Bauer, and a $190 million expansion for Talbot's retailing and direct-marketing operations.    In recent weeks, General Mills executives started voicing concern about the cost of competing for catalog customers over the Christmas season. Analysts also grew skeptical about prospects for the units. John M. McMillin of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., for instance, estimated the company's specialty retailing earnings will decline 13% in the second half of the fiscal year, ending this May.    Mr. McMillin said the two retailing units could fetch between $350 million and $400 million. But speculation in retailing circles put the potential price tag at about $200 million to $250 million. &quot;It's the worst time to sell a retailer,&quot; said one industry executive. &quot;They missed the high&quot; in August, when publicly traded specialty retailers were selling at multiples as high as 35 times earnings. Now they're trading at 10 to 12 times earnings.    Nevertheless, Wall Street viewed the news positively. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, General Mills closed at $52.25, up $1.875.    The outlook for specialty retailers started souring last summer. Then came the October stock market crash, which dragged down consumer confidence and triggered a wave of discounting that made the Christmas season one of the most promotional in recent memory. Specialty apparel retailers were hardest hit.    General Mills said its holiday sales at stores open at least a year rose 4% at Talbots and 6% at Eddie Bauer. A spokesman acknowledged that Talbots was &quot;highly promotional.&quot;    One potential bidder for the stores might be a management group led by David R. Waters, president of General Mills' specialty retailing group, according to retailing industry sources. Mr. Waters wasn't available for comment. Other prospective buyers include such major retailers as J.C. Penney Co., Federated Department Stores Inc. and Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co.    Talbots, based in Hingham, Mass., sells classic women's apparel and accessories at 119 stores and through catalogs. Eddie Bauer, based in Redmond, Wash., sells men's and women's sportswear, accessories and gifts at 49 retail stores and through catalogs.    Though both units have grown rapidly in recent years, General Mills said their operating profits declined 10% for the first half of the current fiscal year. General Mills blamed discounting at Talbots and higher costs related to winning new catalog customers for both companies.    For fiscal 1987, the two specialty retailing units accounted for about 9% of General Mills' $5.19 billion in sales and 6% of its operating profit.    General Mills said proceeds from any sales would help finance &quot;aggressive internal investment plans, with a significant portion allocated to increase the company's stock buy-back program.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
