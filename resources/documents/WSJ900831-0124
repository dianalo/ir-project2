Gordon Crovitz asserted that the U.S. government's&quot;executive order against assassinations is not even a law&quot;(&quot;What if We Had a War and No One Invited the Lawyers?&quot; Ruleof Law, op-ed page, Aug. 8). Nothing could be further fromthe truth. The rule to that effect found in PresidentReagan's Executive Order 12333 of 1981 is based upon article23(b) of the regulations annexed to Hague Convention No. IV:&quot;It is especially forbidden . . . to kill or woundtreacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation orarmy.&quot; Paragraph 31 of U.S. Department of the Army FieldManual 27-10, &quot;The Law of Land Warfare&quot; (1956),authoritatively defines this provision to mean: &quot;This articleis construed as prohibiting assassination, proscription oroutlawry of an enemy. . . .&quot;   Beyond Executive Order 12333, Hague Convention No. IV is a&quot;treaty&quot; that has received the advice and consent of the U.S.Senate and is therefore &quot;the supreme Law of the Land&quot;according to Article 6 of the U.S. Constitution. And even ifCongress were to enact a statute that expressly repealed therule found in Hague Regulation article 23(b) that still wouldnot help. This is because the Nuremberg Tribunal of 1945expressly ruled that the rules found in the Hague Regulationshad entered into customary international law as of 1939. Evenmore recently, the U.S. District Court for the District ofColumbia held in 1980 that Chile's assassination of OrlandoLetelier on the streets of Washington was &quot;clearly contraryto the precepts of humanity as recognized in both nationaland international law.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Hence, it is the longstanding position of the U.S.government that the assassination of anyone -- let alone ahead of state or head of government -- is a violation of thelaws and customs of warfare and therefore an internationaland domestic crime. Any government officials who orderassassinations would be subject to prosecution in any stateof the world that obtained jurisdiction over them. The repealof Executive Order 12333 would not change this.   Francis A. Boyle   Professor of International Law   University of Illinois   Champaign, Ill.   ---   In the context of implying that the U.S. shouldassassinate or abet the assassination of Saddam Hussein, Mr.Crovitz states, &quot;President Bush should be free to choose hismilitary strategy without having to worry about legalities.&quot;If Mr. Bush is so free, so is Mr. Hussein, who has alreadyused chemical weapons on his own people and threatens to doso again on Israel's people; so, in retrospect, was Hitler;so, in the future, will be any head of state. The inhibitionsthat have been reinforced by the accumulated body ofinternational treaties and law would be simply swept away.   Mr. Crovitz also declares: &quot;It demeans the law to try toforce the circle of the rule of law into the square of aninternational battlefield.&quot; Without that circle there isnothing, in our era of nuclear and chemical weapons, toprevent that square from becoming our vast common grave.   The mass murderer Saddam Hussein should be overthrown, andif he dies in the event so be it. But as to waging warwithout &quot;worry about legalities,&quot; Mr. Crovitz should be morecareful. President Bush -- or Mr. Hussein -- might bereading.   Ronnie Dugger   Publisher   The Texas Observer   Wellfleet, Mass.</TEXT></DOC>
