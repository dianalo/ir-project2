From a police helicopter flying over the valley, thousands ofbright green fields of coca, the raw material of cocaine, arevisible through the haze. The plots, the labor of tens of thousandsof peasants who have burned off the hillsides, stand out clearlyagainst the dark mat of surrounding tropical foliage.   Also visible from the air are dozens of illegal landing stripscut into the jungle to accommodate the small planes that daily pickup shipments of semi-refined cocaine for final processing inneighboring Colombia.   The Upper Huallaga Valley stretches 150 miles north of thisramshackle town, located on the jungle-draped eastern slopes of theAndes Mountains, 230 miles northeast of Lima.   The valley is the world's largest single source of coca leaf. Assuch it is the focus of the latest strategy in the United States'faltering war against the cocaine trade.   The U.S. government is testing Tebuthiuron, an herbicide knowncommercially as Spike, against coca bushes in a one-acre plot on asteep valley slope. Preliminary results show the chemical to bedeadly against the tough coca plant. Aerial application is to betried next.   If that proves effective and if the U.S. government can resolvea dispute with the herbicide's producer, Eli Lilly and Co. ofIndianapolis, about the safety of the chemical, the first programof large-scale eradication of coca plants could follow.   ``Ten years ago I wouldn't have said this, but interdictionalone will not stop the flow of cocaine into the United States,''says Craig Chretien, head of the U.S. Drug EnforcementAdministration's operation in Peru.   American officials have sought to reassure Peruvians of thesafety of Spike, citing studies that indicate the herbicide is lesstoxic to humans than aspirin.   But both Peruvian and foreign environmental advocates arewarning that the use of a strong herbicide in the fragile jungleeco-system is a dangerous gamble.   They fear its long-term consequences and some predict thedestruction of all plant life in a region of great agriculturalpotential already ravaged by the cocaine industry.   Critics also contend that the Spike project is politicallymotivated _ that the Reagan administration is seeking``spectacular'' results in the drive against cocaine during anelection year, with little regard for the ecological implications.   ``The questions raised by persons concerned about the impact onthe environment are perfectly legitimate. That's what we're tryingto determine with testing locally,'' U.S. Ambassador AlexanderWatson said in a recent meeting with American correspondents.   In neighboring Bolivia, which with Peru accounts for more than90 percent of the world's coca leaf production, Foreign MinisterGuillermo Bedregal has said his country will not be a ``guineapig'' for experimentation with toxic herbicides.   But the center-left government of President Alan Garcia, in direneed of U.S. economic aid, has indicated its willingness to attemptherbicide eradication in Peru if it is convinced the herbicide isnot harmful to other plants, animals and human beings.   ``The Peruvian government is willing to use herbicides and isgoing to use them. They are the only weapon we have left againstdrug traffickers,'' says a senior official in Peru's anti-drugeffort, speaking on condition he not be identified by name.   Cultivation of coca in Peru has soared dramatically from 40,000acres in 1974 to between 250,000 and 400,000 acres today.   The increase has come despite a 5-year-old American-financedmanual eradication program. U.S. officials say manual eradicationof plants is too slow and too dangerous because workers are exposedto attacks by the hired gunmen of the drug barons and by MaoistShining Path rebels who prowl the valley.   Thirty-four members of eradication teams have been killed inrecent years, and in 1987 the 460 workers in the program pulled uponly 876 acres of plants.   The 3-year-old Garcia administration has tried to disrupt themarketing network of Peruvian and Colombian drug organizations. ButAmerican drug officials, while praising Peru's commitment, say theefforts have been frustrated by the far greater resources of thecocaine lords.   Since 1985, a special anti-narcotics police force hasconfiscated nearly 100 tons of semi-refined cocaine paste, burned770 crude jungle labs for producing paste, and dynamited more than170 clandestine airstrips, according to Gen. Juan Zarate, head ofthe narcotics unit.   But the drug gangs have quickly repaired the dirt runways, oftenwithin 24 hours, using well-paid work crews of local villagers andsometimes even earth-moving tractors, Zarate said in an interview.   The campaign against cocaine ran into a new obstacle since thefanatical Shining Path guerrillas extended their presence in theUpper Huallaga Valley in early 1987.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
