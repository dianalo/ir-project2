After injection into athymic nude miceby four different routes, primary tumors and secondary lung metastaseswere isolated, adapted to in vitro growth, and analyzed for DNA levelsand mRNA expression of both genes for comparison with the originallyinjected transformed cells and untransformed 3T3 cells. For all tumors(primary or secondary), the v-Ki-ras gene was amplified and v-Ki-rasmRNA expression was highly elevated above that observed in the originaltransformed cell population. In two of five lung metastases from thei.v. and footpad injection routes, rearranged Ki-ras DNA sequences wereobserved. Micrometastases from the s.c. route of injection did not displaythese alterations. Injection of footpad lung tumor cells with rearrangementsinto a second group of animals led to multiple lung metastases with evenfurther rearrangements correlating with more effective lung colonization/growthability. However, reinjection of an i.v. lung tumor with rearranged Ki-rasled to no further rearrangements in the lung microfoci tumors isolatedandgt; 40 days after injection. These data suggest (i) the significance ofamplification and elevated expression of v-Ki-ras in tumor formation,(ii) correlation of this amplification with more effective tumor progression,and (iii) the selective advantage that cells with Ki-ras DNA sequenceadditions have in the formation of overt lung tumors.</TEXT></DOC>
