Rabin, on a visit to the West Bank, also said there were few ifany Israeli mercenaries.   He and other officials sought to stem the scandal aboutallegations that former army officers gave paramilitary training toassassination squads for the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia.   Israeli media said the issue also had divided governmentofficials and could affect lucrative arms exports to Colombia.   Police questioned two more employee of Hod Hahanit, or Spearhead,a security and arms trading company said to have provided trainingfor the cartel.   Yair Klein, a reserve lieutenant colonel who heads the company,confirmed Wednesday an Israeli official told him to leave Colombiabecause he might be arrested _ raising the possibility thegovernment knew more of his dealings than it has acknowledged.   Parliament's law committee rejected a proposal that lawscontrolling the export of arms and military expertise bestrengthened to allow prosecution of Israelis for offenses committedabroad.   Some lawmakers said even discussing the matter could influencethe current police investigation. Legislator Amnon Rubinstein of theleft-leaning Shinui party said the government was moving too slowly.   ``What bothers me is that, for a very long time, these thingshave been known,'' he said. ``In my opinion, there is no room forIsraelis to be military advisers to unsavory types.''   Rabin told journalists: ``I believe the media, especially inIsrael, are making unjustified statements based on rumors ratherthan on solid information.''   He said the government was investigating and would punish anyformer officers who broke Israeli law. ``We are not trying to hide,to conceal,'' the defense minister said.   Israel's controls on exports of military equipment and knowledgeare the most stringent in the world and companies must have DefenseMinistry permits for overseas deals, Rabin said.   ``I believe basically the number of people who have not obeyedthe law ... is very, very limited,'' he said. ``One or two Israelicompanies either worked without permission or went beyond thepermission. Allow me also to stress the point that Israelimercenaries are basically non-existent.''   News reports from Colombia said five Israelis were amongforeigners involved in training killers for the drug cartels.   A report in Haaretz, an Israeli papter, said defense officialsignored advice by the Foreign Ministry two years ago not to issuepermits for deals with private groups in Colombia because thecountry was unstable.   Al Hamishmar, another daily, said Rabin was angered by PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir's expression of doubt, after Rabin orderedan investigation, that any Israeli officers had behaved improperly.   Israel radio said the allegations were raising questions inColombia about whether to order more Kfir jet fighters from Israel.   Arms exports usually are secret in Israel, but the daily YediotAhronot said Tuesday that Colombia had bought more than $350 millionworth of aircraft, guns and other military hardware from thiscountry in the past several years.</TEXT></DOC>
