After a preliminary survey of the material this month, ``ourhistorians tell us they have seen documents that have not been seenby Western eyes for the past 40 years,'' said Miles Lerman,chairman of the Committee of International Relations for the UnitedStates Holocaust Memorial Council.   Lerman signed an agreement July 29 in Moscow which will allowU.S. historians to photograph the documents for storage in theholocaust museum Congress has authorized the council to build onthe Washington Mall by 1991.   The Soviets also will receive microfilm and microfiche copies ofthe documents, made at the expense of the U.S. council.   ``By microfilming and microfiching the documents we extend theirshelf life for by at least 300 years,'' said Lerman. ``That's oneof the things that turned them around.''   The Kremlin has long blocked Western and Soviet historians fromviewing archives, including those from the period of Nazioccupation, and U.S. historians attribute the shift to the reformpolicies of Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   ``This is a 180-degree turn around in the attitude of the Sovietauthorities,'' said Raul Hilberg, a University of Vermont historianwho accompanied Lerman on his trip to Moscow and reviewed documentsin the Soviet capital and other cities.   ``It's a humongous amount, oceans and oceans of material'' inthree dozen archives administered by Glav Archiv for the SovietCouncil of Ministers, said Lerman.   The archives will not be opened to Soviets, said Lerman andHilberg.   In the past, the Soviets have given the West piecemeal archivalmaterials, such as the identification card that was crucial in theconviction last April of John Demjanjuk. He was sentenced to deathin Israel for operating gas chambers at Treblinka, the Nazi camp inPoland where hundreds of thousands died.   Hilberg, who has been studying holocaust documents for 40 years,said the Soviet archives provide extraordinary detail of theday-to-day operation of Nazi death camps and the security forcesunder German occupation.   ``The collaboration was much greater in areas held by the SovietUnion for brief periods of time'' before the war, ``higher in thewest Ukraine than in the east, higher in the Baltic buffer statesand eastern Poland,'' said Hilberg.   Those areas were annexed by the Soviet Union under the secretprovisions of a Nazi-Soviet treaty signed the month before Germanyinvaded Poland in 1939, starting World War II.   Material in the archives ``shows the transformation of the humanpsyche during the Nazi occupation,'' said Hilberg. ``The drasticnature of the German occupation was such that the effect on thepopulation was dramatic. This was true not only of Jews who werekilled, but those who watched it.''   In one document Hilberg reviewed in the Soviet archives, ``aGerman officer wrote that anti-Semitism was decreasing amongLatvians in 1943'' after nearly all the Jews in that Balticrepublic had been killed and the Soviets started to drive the Nazisout, said Hilberg.   The Latvians, said Hilberg, ``saw they had thrown in their lotwith the Germans, they virtually exterminated the Jewish populationthere, and then they had second thoughts'' as the Soviets turnedthe tide of battle.   ``Altogether in this country we may have underestimated theextent to which people in the Soviet Union were subjected to theoccupation. We might have had a different relationship with theSoviet Union if we had known this.   ``But the Soviets were secretive, apparently trying to hide theweaknesses of communism, and in some cases the degree to whichpeople collaborated,'' he said.   Photographing the documents might take about a year, and cost $1million to $1.5 million, Hilberg said.   The microfilm will be housed in the holocaust museum, a 200,000square foot structure to be built adjacent to the Bureau ofPrinting and Engraving near the Washington Monument, for anestimated cost of $90 million raised from private donations.   The holocaust council, consisting of 55 members appointed by thepresident and five each from the House and Senate, plans to raisean additional $53 million as a permanent endowment for the museum,said spokesman Samuel Eshkenazi.</TEXT></DOC>
