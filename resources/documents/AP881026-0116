Since the United States and the Soviet Union signed a treaty inDecember to eliminate medium-range nuclear weapons, much attentionhas shifted to upgrading short-range nuclear artillery and missiles.   The talks of the Brussels-based North Atlantic TreatyOrganization, which begin at The Hague, Netherlands, will focus onwhether the Western alliance should modernize these forces.   A Dutch defense specialist, who spoke on condition of anonymity,told reporters in The Hague that the talks will ``make an inventoryof our options.'' The source said the discussions would provide Gen.John Galvin, commander of NATO forces in Europe, with guidelines formaking a decision in 1989 or 1990.   Most NATO nations want to extend the range of the short-rangetactical weapons to make up for the loss of weapons under theIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. That pact eliminated allU.S. and Soviet land-based missiles with ranges from 300 to 3,000miles.   The range of a new generation of weapons would likely be extendedup to the treaty limits of about 300 miles, analysts say.   A key candidate for upgrading is the Lance surface-to-surfacemissile, which was introduced in 1972 and which military analystssay will be obsolete by 1995. The Lance has a range of just over 62miles, but a new system might boost that above 248 miles.   The United States and United Kingdom have indicated support formodernizing the short-range weapons. But Germany and theNetherlands, which have strong anti-nuclear movements, have arguedthat such a decision is not yet needed.   The defense ministers, meeting as NATO's Nuclear Planning Group,gather twice a year.   Fourteen of NATO's 16 members will take part in the talks.Iceland attends only as an observer, and France operates outsideNATO's common military planning. U.S. Defense Secretary FrankCarlucci will represent the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
