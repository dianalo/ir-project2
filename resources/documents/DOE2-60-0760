<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-60-0760 </DOCNO><TEXT>Dry seeds of three soybean varieties were irradiated by /sup 60/Co {gamma}ray with dosage of 4.1C/kg. The varieties irradiated were Fengshou No.10, Donghong 74-403 and Heinong No. 26, and nonirradiated seeds of thecorresponding variety was used as a control. The following genetic parametersof the nine agronomic characters were estimated, including genotypiccoefficient of variation, genotypic variance, broad sense heritanilityand genetic advance expected through selection. Three types of plantin M/sub 2/ and M/sub 3/ were used for the estimation of these parameterswhich comprise semisterility (MS), fertility (MF) in M/sub 1/ and control(CK). The genetic advance expected through selection was compared withthe actual effect of selection for date of maturity, seed weigh per plantand 100 seed wight. The pattern of the genetic variation in the earlygenerations of the induced population was analysed. Problems of selectionfor main agronomic characters in the early generations, and significanceof fertility of M/sub 1/ plants for mutation breeding were discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
