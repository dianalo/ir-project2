(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Giving up cigarettes is more than just amatter of willpower and smokers need more help just saying no tonicotine once they try to quit, a federal health official said.   Noting that ``nicotine is an addictive drug,'' John Pierce, chiefof epidemiology in the federal Office of Smoking and Health inRockville, Md., said former smokers tend to relapse.   ``It is no longer an issue of getting people to quit, but how tohelp people stay off cigarettes,'' he said.   Although 17 million smokers attempt to quit each year, only 1.3million succeed, Pierce said. And though 60 percent of smokers neverlight up after quitting, the rest do, he said.   The first through fifth years after quitting is the period thatneeds most attention, he said Thursday.   Pierce, an Australian epidemiologist who was involved in hishomeland's anti-smoking program, spoke at the start of a two-dayconference of 130 health educators and practitioners who create,provide and finance services that help smokers quit.   The sponsor of the national Conference on Smoking Cessation wasthe Institute for the Study of Smoking Behavior and Policy atHarvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.   About 50 million Americans smoke. Despite a decline in thepopularity of smoking, it is estimated 40 million people still willbe puffing away in the year 2000.   ``Are there ways to get more people to use these programs? Thisissue needs to be treated more like a business,'' John Pinney,executive director of the smoking institute, said in an interview.   ``It's a mass marketing problem. We're trying to help peopleexamine this issue in a way it hasn't been examined before,'' saidPinney, head of the U.S. Office of Smoking and Health in the Carteradministration.   David Levinson, Delaware insurance commissioner and anotherconference speaker, said insurance companies need to be compelled tooffer discounts for non-smokers and reimbursements for the cost ofprograms smokers use to give up tobacco.   A national leader in pushing for such insurance coverage,Levinson charged that the industry resists such efforts.   ``The bottom line is that health insurance companies don't wantto have healthy citizens, because then they would make less money(from medical claims) ... What businessman in America is going to bein favor of that?'' Levinson said.   He called on government regulators of health insurance to compelinsurers to offer such coverage more widely.   Later, in a telephone interview from Washington, a spokesman forthe health insurance industry dismissed Levinson's charges.   ``The insurance industry stands second to no one in its effortsto reduce smoking,'' said Donald B. White, spokesman for the HealthInsurance Association of America.   White said health insurers have helped establish programs topromote health through the workplace and large health insurers offerdiscounts for individual policy holders who don't smoke.   ``It is to everyone's financial interest to reduce smoking asmuch as possible,'' said White, whose lobbying group represents 350insurers.</TEXT></DOC>
