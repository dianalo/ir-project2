These canisters, containingspecified amounts of {sup 137}Cs and {sup 90}Sr, will be sealed usinga gas tungsten arc welder (GTAW) and will be decontaminated to nonsmearablelimits using an electropolishing system. They are to be characterizedin a series of nondestructive tests: surface dose rate measurement, axialgamma scanning, canister mass determination, and canister surface temperaturemeasurement. The canisters will then be transported to the Asse SaltMine located in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) for a 5-yr repositorytesting program.</TEXT></DOC>
