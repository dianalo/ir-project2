Activists say theofficers brutally put down recent protests.   The Soviet media did not report on the measure issued Friday,but they carried extensive dispatches on a decree that requiresadvance permission for public demonstrations and meetings and setsstiff fines and jail terms for violators.   Demonstrations have become more frequent under Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or greater openness.   The decree involving the paramilitary police also empowers theofficers to enter homes and businesses in pursuit of suspects,seize autos and communications equipment and use a wide range ofweapons.   Crowd control previously was the responsibility of regularpolice, who along with the paramilitary police are governed by theInterior Ministry. The paramilitary police until now had beenassigned only to guard prisons and labor camps and protectgovernment property and special shipments.   The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet approved the new decree July28 and it was published in a legislative digest that reachedsubscribers Friday. The measure was signed by President AndreiGromyko.   Political activists say the paramilitary police turned up at ademonstration Sunday in Moscow and during this year's unrest inArmenia.   ``In peacetime, the army is taking on extraordinary powers,''said Yuri Mityunov, a leader of an unofficial opposition politicalgroup called the Democratic Union. ``What is happening here is whathappens in other countries only under martial law.''   Mityunov said the new measure gives paramilitary police _ notregular police _ jurisdiction for the first time over politicalmeetings and demonstrations.   Dissident journalist Sergei Grigoryants said alleged beatings atSunday's protest were unprecedented in recent times.   On Sunday, the paramilitary police helped regular police stop aDemocratic Union protest in Moscow's Pushkin Square against theSoviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia 20 years ago.   They wore khaki uniforms without insignias, black boots andberets with Interior Ministry markings. More than 100 protesterswere arrested and dissidents said the paramilitaries beat andkicked about 30 of them.   Mityunov said some members of the force told those arrested theyhad served in the Soviet army in Afghanistan.   Paramilitary police units were reported in Armenia as early asFebruary, months before the decree. They helped quelldemonstrations by Armenians demanding the annexation ofNagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian region attached to theneighboring republic of Azerbaijan.   Under the decree, paramilitary police need not obtain a searchwarrant from a prosecutor, as regular police are required to do.Mityunov said this violates a constitutional provision ofinviolability of the home.   Gorbachev told a special Communist Party conference June 28there should be ``strict observance of the rights of citizens tothe inviolability of their private life, home, the secrecy oftelephone communication, postal and telegraph correspondence.''   On Friday, Mityunov said: ``Gorbachev ... called for creation ofa state based on laws, but even in the times of (Soviet dictatorJosef) Stalin there weren't laws that openly violated theconstitution, such as this one does regarding inviolability.''   The decree says the paramilitary police will be used to stopviolations of public order that have a ``mass character,'' threatenpeople's lives and health, disrupt businesses and damage property.</TEXT></DOC>
