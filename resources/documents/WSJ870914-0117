Nor will Saudi Arabia use its influence to coerce Persian Gulf neighbors such as Iraq and the United Arab Emirates into holding oil output within OPEC production quotas.    But the kingdom will continue to cooperate with all 12 of the other members -- including Iran, despite tense relations between the two nations -- in new efforts to maintain OPEC's fixed-price structure and the production ceiling of 16.6 million barrels a day set last June for the 1987 second half. Saudi Arabia also is willing to take the lead in allowing field supervision of its production, providing that all the exporters agree to an onsite monitoring system to make sure that members stay within their quotas.    Those were the chief points made by Hisham M. Nazer of Saudi Arabia in an interview, his first since he succeeded Ahmed Zaki Yamani as oil minister last year. His remarks underscored the Saudi determination to no longer provide a &quot;quick fix&quot; when OPEC production levels get out of line.    Mr. Nazer was among the five oil ministers who met here late last week in an effort to protect OPEC's base price of $18 a barrel by determining how to trim the glut of oil pouring from OPEC and non-OPEC producers since Persian Gulf tension escalated this summer. The so-called Committee of Five downplayed as exaggerated industry reports that the 13 member countries were producing three million barrels a day above their ceiling.    But the committee members decided nonetheless on the need for renewed efforts by OPEC to &quot;strengthen the oil market and to reinforce the defense of the organization's fixed-pricing policy,&quot; according to the communique issued after the close of their meeting.    To this end, the ministers agreed to send a delegation of three to heads of state in all OPEC nations, to gain political support for whatever steps are necessary to ensure compliance with production quotas and official selling prices -- including the possibility of an on-site monitoring system.    Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, OPEC's president, will head the delegation, accompanied by Indonesian Oil Minister Subroto and Venezuela's Arturo Hernandez Grisanti. Their appeals to the heads of state will begin next month, with the first stop in Saudi Arabia.    In the interview, Mr. Nazer said he wanted to reaffirm that Saudi Arabia, currently producing at its quota of 4.3 million barrels a day, doesn't intend to return to its old role of tailoring output to changes in demand for all OPEC oil in order to prop up the price. There had been speculation inside and outside OPEC that to protect the $18 base price the kingdom would cut its own production, even if others didn't. But Mr. Nazer made clear that Saudi Arabia sees its role as the same as that expected of any OPEC member.    &quot;We will conscientiously support OPEC and support the work of the committee, but we will not appoint ourselves custodians of the policies of OPEC,&quot; Mr. Nazer said. &quot;Nor will we be willing to play the role of swing producer at all,&quot; he said.    Mr. Nazer also rejected another bit of speculation -- centered on expressions of hope from some other ministers here, as well as from an unexpected &quot;observer,&quot; the deputy oil minister of Iran -- that Saudi Arabia would use its &quot;good offices&quot; to bring its Persian Gulf neighbors into line on production quotas. These neighbors include Kuwait, but targeted more specifically are the UAE, which consistently overproduces, and Iraq, which refuses to accept an OPEC quota, much less abide by it.    &quot;I do not think that singling out any one country for overproduction is a fair thing to do,&quot; Mr. Nazer said, adding: &quot;What I want to say is that we will not take any personal individual action as (the) government of Saudi Arabia&quot; to influence the alleged quota violators.    While world oil markets may interpret these remarks as bearish for prices, Mr. Nazer issued a clearly bullish signal on another matter, regarding Iran.    There had been concern that previous collaboration between Saudi Arabia and Iran -- credited with ending last year's oil-price war -- would collapse in OPEC councils because of recent bitter recriminations over the Mecca riot, in which hundreds of Iranian pilgrims were killed. Iran, which wants to push up the OPEC base price to $20 a barrel for 1988, already had indicated its determination to continue to cooperate with Saudi Arabia, although its uninvited representative here wanted the kingdom to pressure other Arab producers to adhere to their production quotas.    Asked whether the recent rise in rhetoric will dissolve the Saudi-Iran axis at the OPEC conference table, Mr. Nazer replied: &quot;We will work with all the OPEC members for the benefit of the organization.&quot;    Although Saudi Arabia previously has indicated it would like to see the OPEC $18-a-barrel base price continued into next year, Mr. Nazer didn't discuss pricing levels except to cite the importance of stability -- to consuming nations as well as producing countries. &quot;We've all benefited by that stability,&quot; he said.    He also questioned whether OPEC production is as high as it is thought by many to be. &quot;There is a great deal of speculation as to what the actual level is,&quot; he said. But he added: &quot;I hope that this overproduction is an aberration, and not a trend.&quot;    Interviews with the three ministers who will carry the quota-compliance appeal to heads of state also revealed a consensus that production already is dropping, mainly because of market forces. &quot;This is sort of a transitional period,&quot; said Mr. Subroto of Indonesia.    Some OPEC sources estimated that production has declined by one million barrels a day in the past three weeks. &quot;This kind of thing is self-correcting -- up to a point,&quot; said Nigeria's Mr. Lukman.    But even though market forces are helping, &quot;we feel there are negative potential factors in the whole situation,&quot; said Mr. Hernandez Grisanti of Venezuela. However, he added, &quot;within the next two months, we should see some results from our efforts.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
