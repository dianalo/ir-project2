Keating Jr.'scriminal trial was disrupted when a 90-year-old woman grabbedthe former chairman of American Continental Corp. as he wasleaving the courtroom and shouted that he had stolen hersavings.   The woman was led away by bailiffs and released in thehallway, where a crowd began chanting, &quot;Mr. Cheating, where'sour money?&quot; and, &quot;Pay it back, Charlie]&quot; The episodesprompted defense lawyers to propose tightening courtroomsecurity for the duration of the fraud case, expected to lastat least six months.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Keating was charged with making misstatements andomissions during the sale of high-risk debt at branches ofthe company's former thrift, Lincoln Savings andamp; LoanAssociation.   A key issue in the case remains whether the jury will beinstructed that Mr. Keating can only be found guilty if heknew about or intended that fraud occur. Superior Court JudgeLance Ito has deferred a ruling on the jury instruction --saying that the case &quot;will rise or fall on the quality of it&quot;-- until today.   Mr. Keating maintains that he shouldn't be held criminallyresponsible for sales pitches that he didn't know about. Hehas also said that prospectuses supplied to bond buyers wereaccurate. He blames federal regulators for many of thetroubles at the Phoenix, Ariz., company, which filed forbankruptcy-law protection after Lincoln was seized in April1989.</TEXT></DOC>
