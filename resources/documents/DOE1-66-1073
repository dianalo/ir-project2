<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-66-1073 </DOCNO><TEXT>The pressure dependence of T/sub c/ is presented for YBa/sub 2/Cu/sub3/O/sub 7-x/ samples which belong to the second generation of superconductingoxides with T/sub c/ above 90 K and the orthorhombic (Pmm 2) crystalstructure. The superconducting transition of sintered samples (0.38 {le}x {le} 0.42) was indicated by resistivity measurements at pressures upto 0.8 GPa. The dependence of T/sub c/ on hydrostatic pressure is givenand discussed within a standard electron-phonon BCS theory.</TEXT></DOC>
