(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A woman who made headlines five years ago asthe nation's lowest-paid teacher has returned to reopen theone-room schoolhouse where she taught for 16 years.   Janice Herbranson, 54, left North Dakota to teach in Texas afterthe McLeod school closed in 1986. Only one student remained in thedistrict, and the school board decided it was not practical to keepthe building open.   However, Herbranson said Wednesday the McLeod school wouldreopen Aug. 29 with five pupils.   ``The whole community feels that something is back to life. It'sexciting for all of us,'' said Herbranson, who was the school'slone teacher for 16 years before it closed.   Two of the children will be in kindergarten, two will be infirst grade and one will be in sixth grade, she said.   The district in this community of 45 residents faced theprospect of being dissolved if it did not reopen this year,Herbranson said.   Herbranson taught prekindergarten children in Progreso, Texas,last year, and said she enjoyed the experience.   ``I just thoroughly thought it was a great place to be,'' shesaid. ``I love the Mexican-American people. I miss the kidsalready.''   Herbranson received national attention in 1983 when the NationalEducation Association identified her as the nation's lowest-paidteacher. Her annual salary was $6,300 at the time.   Herbranson was making $6,800 when the McLeod school closed. Shesaid she and the district have not settled on her pay for thecoming year, but it will likely be more than what she made at theschool two years ago.   Whatever her salary is in McLeod, it will be a substantial paycut from her Texas job, which paid her $25,000 annually, Herbransonsaid.   Herbranson said she took the job in Texas to experience adifferent culture. She was waiting for a teaching job in Alaskawhen the Progreso school district recruited her through MoorheadState University in Minnesota, where she had been taking classes.   She still maintains part ownership in the Sand Dune Saloon inthis southeastern North Dakota town.   Herbranson said she believes the McLeod school has a brightfuture. With several preschool children in the district, theenrollment is expected to grow, she said.   In addition, at least three families from outside the districthave contacted her about sending their children to McLeod thisyear, she said.   Herbranson said the school's reopening is a victory of sorts forrural one-room schoolhouses.   ``It's a good type of education, there's no doubt in my mind,''she said.</TEXT></DOC>
