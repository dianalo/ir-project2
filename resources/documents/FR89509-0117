Introduction</ITAG>On September 22, 1986, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'')submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or``SEC''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of1934 (``Act'')\1\<NOTE/> and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\<NOTE/> a proposed rule change designed to update certain of theRules of the Exchange's Board of Governors and eliminate outdated materialtherein. Amendment No. 1, submitted by the BSE on April 10, 1989, addsclarifying amendments to the original filing.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4.Notice of the proposed rule change was provided by the issuance of a Commissionrelease (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24563, June 5, 1987) and bypublication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 22869, June 16, 1987). The Commissionreceived no comments on the proposed rule change.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Description of the Proposal</ITAG>On July 24, 1986, the BSE Board of Governors approved revisions to certainof its Rules. The proposed amendments clarify and update several areasof the BSE rules, including the definitional section and rules pertainingto dealings on the exchange. The first category, ``Definitions'', includes<T3>inter alia</T3> proposed changes and clarifying amendments to the Exchange'sdefinition of the terms ``Board of Governors'', ``Floor Officials'', ``Member'',and ``Control''. The changes also set forth the power of Floor Officialsto supervise active openings and unusual situations. With respect to theproposed definition of ``control'', Amendment No. 1 clarifies that theExchange's definition of ``control'' is limited in its application to ExchangeRules and therefore will have no application outside the limited provinceof the BSE's Rules. Amendment No. 1 also adds a definition of ``person''to the Exchange's roster of defined entities.The proposed rule change would define certain bids and offers as specifiedorders, including, for example, ``All or None Orders'', ``Fill or KillOrders'', ``Market Orders'', and ``Not Held Orders''. Amendment No. 1 clarifiesthat the making of ``all or none'' bids or offers is prohibited in stocks.Amendment No. 1 also clarifies that a specialist may not accept ``not held''orders.The second category of revisions under the proposed rule change falls underthe rubric of ``Dealings on the Exchange''. The proposed rule change <T3>inter alia</T3> specifies that only BSE-approved securities may betraded on the Exchange. The rule change also sets the settlement datesfor contracts made on the Exchange, as well as makes clarifying amendmentsto the Exchange's rules of priority and precedence. Moreover, for easeof reference, the proposed rule change incoporates into the Exchange'srules Commission Rule 11Ac1-1, which governs the dissemination of quotationsfor reported securities. The proposed rule change also adds a variety ofinterpretations regarding the duties of specialists and members with respectto their order handling activities.The rule change would also establish a procedure to suspend and resumetrading in all securities as appropriate. Under this procedure the Chairman,Vice Chairman and Floor Governors by majority vote would have the powerto suspend trading in securities on the Exchange. Amendment No. 1 clarifiesthat the new authority to suspend trading extends to ``any and all'' BSE-listedsecurities, but only where appropriate ``in the public interest''. If thesuspension would continue for more than one day, a special meeting of theBoard of Governors would have to be called. Finally, the proposed rulechange would clarify the availability to members or member-organizationsof minutes or other records of the Board of Governors in connection witha disciplinary action taken against such a member of member-organization.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion and Conclusion</ITAG>The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent withsection 6(b) of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder applicableto a national securities exchange. More specifically, the Commission believesthat the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of theAct, which requires exchange rules to prevent fraudulent and manipulativeacts and practices, promote just and equitable principles of trade, andprotect investors and the public interest. The Commission agrees with theBSE that the proposed rule change eliminates outdated and duplicative material,thereby clarifying existing Exchange Rules. Moreover, the new provisionsshould similarly serve to clarify and establish existing BSE policies andprocedures, such as procedures for the suspension of trading, not previouslyset forth in the Exchange's published Rules. We note also that the Commissionreceived no comments from either BSE members and member organizations ofBSE-listed companies concerning these proposed rule changes. Accordingly,the Commision views as appropriate the Exchange's revisions to the Rulesof its Board of Governors.<T3>It is Therefore Ordered,</T3> pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,that the above mentioned rule change is hereby approved.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuantto delegated authority.\3\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ See 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(44).<ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
