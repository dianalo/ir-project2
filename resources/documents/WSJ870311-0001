Despite the dollar's nearly 1.5-pfennig jump Monday, &quot;the market's been dead in the water, looking for direction,&quot; said Carmine Rotondo, a vice president at Security Pacific International Bank. &quot;You can't make any money like this; it's been a horror.&quot;    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8565 West German marks, down from 1.8595 marks the day before, and at 153.73 yen, down from 153.92 yen. The British pound fell marginally to $1.5865 from $1.5883 on Monday.    During the New York trading day, the U.S. unit moved within very narrow ranges of 0.85 pfennigs and 0.30 yen. Meanwhile, sterling traded in a range of 0.5 U.S. cents, and the Canadian dollar in an even-narrower 0.02-cent range.    Traders said they hope that U.S. economic statistics on retail sales, producer prices and industrial production, to be released later this week, will help push the dollar out of the relatively narrow trading range it has occupied since Feb. 23. That was the first trading day after the six largest industrialized nations agreed in Paris that the currency had fallen enough and hinted they were prepared to intervene to stem any further declines.    U.S. retail sales for February, which are due out tomorrow, are expected to show between a 3% and 5% rise, compared with a 5.8% drop in January. Similarly, some analysts predict that U.S. industrial production figures for February, to be released Friday, will increase between 0.2% to a hefty 0.8%. In January, industrial production rose 0.4%.    Richard Witten, a vice president at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., also said that &quot;if the U.S. stats are good, we will see people trading the dollar on the long side,&quot; betting that the currency will strengthen. But, noting the reluctance of dealers to try to push the dollar lower after the Feb. 27 release of a large U.S. trade deficit for January, he warned: &quot;We may have hunkered in for a period of sideways trading.&quot;    Mr. Witten noted that for the past two weeks, most trading hasn't centered around the dollar. Instead, he said, dealers were playing so-called cross rates, particularly other currencies against the West German mark, which has been weakened by a slowing economy.    Moreover, &quot;as investors have become convinced that major currency relationships will be stable in the near term, they've been encouraged to search out higher-yielding investments,&quot; said John Lipsky, a vice president at Salomon Brothers Inc. The major beneficiaries, he noted, have been British government bonds as well as those denominated in Australian and Canadian dollars and, to some extent, New Zealand dollars.    &quot;We've seen definite buying out of Switzerland and Germany looking for higher yields,&quot; said Ian Lindston, a trader at Westpac Banking Corp. in New York. Analysts noted that while six-month Eurodeposit rates for marks, yen and dollars were 4%, 4.13% and 6.375%, respectively, the equivalents for the British, Australian and New Zealand currencies were 9.75%, 16.125% and 22.75%.    &quot;You can literally take a 12% interest-rate differential between the Australian dollar and the mark that leaves quite a lot of room for currency depreciation,&quot; said Mr. Lindston.    Mr. Lipsky of Salomon Brothers noted that since Feb. 20, the last trading day before the Feb. 22 pact on the dollar, the mark has fallen 5.5% against sterling, 3.8% against the Australian currency, 4.4% against that of New Zealand and 1.3% against the Canadian dollar. Japan's currency also has fallen against its British, Australian and New Zealand counterparts, but by lesser amounts.    Based on fundamental economic factors such as inflation rates, retail sales and trade, the high-yielding currencies ought &quot;to be less attractive,&quot; noted Mr. Lindston. &quot;There's no fundamental reason for it other than the interest rate.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for delivery this month settled at $406.80 an ounce, up $1.80. Estimated volume was a moderate 2.8 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $406.40 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.    ---                        CURRENCY RATES                          New York    Home Mkt.
