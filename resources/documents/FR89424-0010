For Illinois, see 43 FR 8962 (March 3, 1978) and 43 FR 45993(October 5, 1978). For these areas, Part D of the Act requires that theState revise its SIP to provide for attaining the primary NAAQS by December31, 1982, (in certain cases, by December 31, 1987, for ozone and/or CO).These SIP revisions must also provide for attaining the secondary NAAQSas soon as practicable. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 added a new Part D to Title I of theAct. Under Part D, the States had to revise their SIPs for all nonattainmentareas and submit the revisions to USEPA by January 1, 1979 (Sections 171-178of the Act; section 129(c) (uncodified) of Pub. L. 95-95). The revisedplan had to provide for attainment in nonattainment areas by December 31,1982, unless the State demonstrated that it could not attain either theozone or CO standard by that date, despite the implementation of all reasonablyavailable control technology (RACT) (Sections 172(a)(1), 172(a) of theAct). If USEPA approved this demonstration, the attainment date for ozone orCO could be extended up to December 31, 1987, and the State could defercertain of the Part D planning requirements but would have to meet additional,more stringent planning requirements at a later date. States receivingsuch extensions were to submit a second SIP revision that provided forattainment by December 31, 1987, and complied with all of the Part D requirements(Section 172(c)). These second SIP revisions had to be submitted by July 1, 1982 (Section129(c) (uncodified), Pub. L. 95-95). On January 22, 1981 (48 FR 7182),USEPA published final criteria for reviewing these revisions. These criteriasupplemented the ``General Preamble'' for SIP revisions for nonattainmentareas, which was published on April 4, 1979 (44 FR 20372).\1\<NOTE/> Other requirements for plan preparation and USEPA policyguidance were contained in a technical support memorandum dated November15, 1982. These documents are available for review at the Region V office,listed above. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ USEPA published four additional notices supplementingthe general preamble on July 2, 1979 (44 FR 38583); August 28, 1979 (44FR 50371); September 17, 1979 (44 FR 53761) and November 23, 1979 (44 FR67185). In April 1979, the State of Illinois submitted an initial SIP revisionfor CO and ozone in the Illinois portion of the Chicago metropolitan area,and for ozone in the Illinois portion of the St. Louis metropolitan area.In its submittal, the State requested that USEPA extend the attainmentdate for meeting the Ozone and CO standards in these areas until December31, 1987. USEPA approved this request and the initial SIP on February 21,1980 (45 FR 11572). On February 3, 1983 (48 FR 5110), USEPA proposed disapproval of and solicitedpublic comment on the 1982 Illinois SIP revision for CO and Ozone whichhad been submitted by IEPA in draft form on June 30, 1982. On December3, 1982, the State submitted responses to comments included in USEPA'sNovember 15, 1982, Technical Support Document. On May 4, 1983, November4, 1983, and January 20, 1984, the State submitted substantial revisionsto the draft SIP. On August 15, 1984 (49 FR 32601), USEPA again proposed rulemaking on theIllinois Ozone and CO SIP taking into account the submittals sent by theState designed to address the deficiencies identified in the February 3,1983 (48 FR 5110), proposed disapproval of the State's plan. In the August15, 1984, rulemaking, USEPA proposed to approve the State's Ozone and COplans, except for vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M). Today's proposedrulemaking concerns; (1) the transportation control measures, the FederalMotor Vehicle Control Program (FMVCP) and the I/M program, which are partof both the ozone and CO plans; and (2) the CO attainment demonstrationsfor downtown Chicago and the freeway corridors. Remaining portions of theozone SIP are the subject of separate <T4>Federal Register </T4>notices, including one published October 17,1988 (53 FR 40415), which disapproved the Chicago portion of the ozoneSIP. It should also be noted that on May 26, 1988, USEPA notified the Governorof Illinois that the ozone plan was substantially inadequate to attainand maintain the standard in the Chicago area and called for a revisionof the plan. On August 15, 1984 (49 FR 32601), USEPA proposed to approve the State'sattainment demonstrations for CO, including the FMVCP and the transportationcontrol measures in the Chicago area. USEPA has not revised its analysisof these plan elements since the proposed rulemaking at that time.To avoid confusion over changes in other portions of the plan since theAugust 15, 1984, proposed approval, USEPA will again present its analysisof the plan elements and again propose rulemaking on each. <ITAG tagnum="84">Attaintment Demonstration for Carbon Monoxide (CO) in the ChicagoArea </ITAG>The Illinois CO SIP includes separate attainment demonstrations for downtownChicago and for other nonattaintment areas in and near Chicago (i.e., thefreeway corridors). Illinois has submitted two basic attainment demonstrationsfor downtown Chicago. The first demonstration was submitted June 30, 1982,and the second demonstration was submitted May 4, 1983. (Illinois alsosubmitted responses to comments on the first demonstration on December3, 1982.) In its May 4, 1983, submittal, Illinois states that this analysisreflects IEPA's current best estimate of the anticipated emission reductionsfrom implementation of the FMVCP. The May 4 analysis for CO in downtown Chicago relies on the rollback model.This analysis assumed that the violations monitored downtown were predominantlythe result of motor vehicle emissions. Stationary source emissions wereconsidered by means of a 0.2 parts per million (ppm) constant backgroundconcentration. The rollback analysis relied on emission factors derivedfor the MOBILE 2.5 emission factor model. Illinois also used 1982 air qualitydata in its analysis in the belief that the use of these data provide amore stringent test of whether attainment will be achieved by 1987, thando the 1979 to 1981 air quality data. The rollback approach assumes that the nonbackground component of an observedconcentration will decrease by the same percentage as emissions. Illinoisprovided rollback calculations based on a variety of vehicle operatingconditions that might be applicable in the downtown area, as well as fortwo different ambient temperatures. In all cases, attainment was shownto occur by the end of 1987. USEPA made additional calculations based onslightly different assumptions of vehicle operating conditions. These calculationssupport Illinois' conclusion that attainment will be achieved by the endof 1987. Rollback calculations for 1979, 1980, and 1981 support Illinois'sttement that 1982 air quality data are the most stringent data. A final issue concerning the downtown attainment demonstration relatesto I/M. Illinois' attainment demonstration for CO in downtown Chicago doesnot reflect the impact of an I/M program. However, consideration of anI/M program would lead to the projection of an earlier attainment date.Thus, Illinois' attainment demonstration may be considered adequate evidencethat the CO standard will be achieved in downtown Chicago by the end of1987. USEPA, therefore, proposes approval of this portion of the IllinoisSIP. The CO attainment demonstration for the freeway corridors was submittedby Illinois on June 30, 1982. This attainment demonstration was based onhot-spot modeling using the CALINE 3 model. On August 23, 1982, USEPA sentcomments to Illinois on its June 30, 1982, submittal. The original February3, 1983, proposed disapproval did not specifically address the approvabilityof the attainment demonstration for the freeway corridors. Based on USEPA comments transmitted on August 23, 1982, the State submitteda corrected analysis on January 20, 1984. This analysis shows that attainmentdid not occur by 1982 at a few locations in the freeway corridors in theChicago area. However, these locations were predicted to have 1982 concentrationsonly slightly above the standard, and it was predicted likely that basedon reductions obtained from the FMVCP attainment would occur well before1987 at all locations in the Chicago area freeway corridors. USEPA, therefore,proposes to approve this portion of the Illinois SIP. <ITAG tagnum="84">Transportation Control Measures </ITAG>The Transportation Control Plan (TCP) for Northeastern Illinois describeseight TCMs to be implemented to obtain the hydrocarbon (HC) and CO reductiongoal. The TCP will implement the following Transportation Control Measures(TCMs): public transportion; ridesharing; traffic flow improvements; bicyclepromotion; long-range transit; park and ride lots; alternative work schedules;and exclusive bus/car pool lanes. The TCP for East St. Louis describes six TCMs to be implemented to providethe HC emission reduction target. The TCP will implement the followingTCM package: traffic flow improvements; electric vehicles use; increasein ridesharing; increase in van pooling; 30 percent increase in transitridership; and park and ride lots. USEPA finds these TCMs adequate, and USEPA proposes approval of these TCMs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) </ITAG>I. Introduction The Act, as amended in 1977, requires the States that receive an attainmentdate extensions to submit revised Ozone/CO SIPs that include commitmentsto implement I/M program on an expeditious schedule, with implementationcomplete no later than December 31, 1982. The 1982 Ozone/CO SIP approvalpolicy published on January 22, 1981 (46 FR 7182), discusses the 1982 Ozone/COSIP approval requirements. Illinois requested and received the 5-year extensionof the ozone/CO deadline. On August 3, 1983, USEPA proposed to disapprovethe Ozone/CO portion of the SIP (48 FR 35315), because Illinois lackedan I/M program. In accordance with the Act, the USEPA initiated sanctionproceedings against the State. On May 4, 1984, USEPA proposed Federal highwayand air quality funding restrictions, and a construction moratorium, becausethe State failed to submit, or to make reasonable efforts to submit, aSIP which considers each element in Section 172 of the Act (See 49 FR 19039),including an I/M program. Subsequently, State legislation was signed into law in September of 1984,creating the legal authority and funding mechanism for an I/M program tooperate in Cook, and parts of Lake, DuPage, Madison, and St. Clair Counties.This legislation is entitled the ``Vehicle Emission Inspection Law''. Itamended the Illinois Vehicle Code by the addition of ``Chapter 13A, EmissionInspection''. This piece of legislation established: 1. The geographic area subject to vehicle emissions inspection, 2. The general provisions of an inspection program, 3. The conditions for exemption from inspection program, 4. The program's financing mechanisms, 5. The program's enforcement mechanisms, 6. The responsibilities of the affected State government agencies for eachaspect of the program, 7. The conditions for entry into contracts by the State, and 8. Deadlines for implementation for an I/M program in Illinois. II. General Description of the Illinois I/M Program The State of Illinois contracted with Systems Control, Inc., to developand operate a centralized network of testing facilities, consisting of15 facilities, with a total of 78 lanes in Cook County and portions ofLake and DuPage Counties (Chicago area) and 3 facilities with 6 lanes inMadision and St. Clair Counties (the St. Louis area). Vehicles are testedfor hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO<T2>2</T2>) emissions. Illinois' plan states that the 2500 RPM/Idle andEngine Restart 2500 RPM/Idle tests are to be used, depending on the modeland year of the vehicle. In both tests, a probe is inserted into the vehicletailpipe; and the exhaust is analyzed for emission at 2500 RPM and at idle.If the vehicle passes the test, an annual sticker is issued that indicatescompliance with the law. If the vehicle fails to pass the test, the vehicleowner is required to make the necessary repairs and submit the vehiclefor a retest. If the vehicle is unable to pass a retest, a waiver is availableunder certain conditions. Enforcement of the program is accomplished through a vehicle inspectionsticker system. Penalties for failure to secure a sticker include drivers'license and vehicle registration suspensions. III. Evaluation of I/M Program Elements USEPA's Evaluation of the State's I/M program is summarized below. USEPA'sdetailed evaluation of the State's program is contained in technical supportdocuments dated June 6, 1986, February 18, 1987, and October 20, 1987.These documents are available from the Region V Office listed above. USEPA policy, as stated in the January 22, 1981, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(46 FR 7182), requires the inclusion of any rulesand regulations, and any other I/M elements that could affect the abilityof the I/M program to achieve the minimum emission reduction requirements,in any revisions for areas with an attainment date extension.The 1982 Ozone/CO SIP submittal must include the following:1. Inspection test procedures,2. Emission standards,3. Inspection station licensing requirements,4. Emission analyzer specification and maintenance calibration requirements,5. Record keeping and record submittal requirements,6. Quality control audit and surveillance procedures,7. Procedures to ensure that non-complying vehicles are not operated onthe public roads,8. Any other official program rules, regulations, and procedures,9. A public awareness plan, and10. A mechanic training program if additional emission credits are beingclaimed for mechanic training.Each of these SIP requirements are addressed in the Technical Support documentfor this rulemaking which is available from the Region V Office.The following support documents of the SIP address these requirements:1. The Illinois Vehicle Emission Inspection Law;2. The set of regulations amending 35 Illinois Administrative Code, Title35: Environmental Protection, Subtitle B: Air Pollution Control ChapterI: Pollution Control Board, Part 240 (henceforth referred to as the IPCBRules);3. The same set of regulations detailed immediately above, Chapter II:Environmental Protection Agency, Part 276 (referred to as IEPA Rules);4. The IEPA/SOS Joint Memorandum-Technical Procedures for Enforcement (Draft,December 1985) (referred to as the Enforcement Memorandum);5. The Memorandum of Understanding between the Illinois Secretary of Stateand the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency Concerning the Operationof a Vehicle Emission Inspection Program as Required by Public Act 83-1477(referred to as the Memorandum of Understanding);6. ``Strategies Plan for the Air Team Public Information Effort'', Officeof Public Information, IEPA; and7. Summary of I/M RACT Calculations for the Illinois Vehicle Inspectionand Maintenance Program, IEPA Division of Air Pollution Control, August1985 (referred to as I/M RACT Summary).USEPA has carefully reviewed the State's submittal and determined thatit satisfies USEPA's requirements for approval. USEPA, therefore, proposesto approve the State's I/M program as part of the Ozone and CO SIPs.However, during the first year of the program not all subject vehiclesreceived a test notification from the State and the seven month enforcementcycle, as specified by State procedures, was not met. While USEPA acknowledgesthat over the past few months significant enforcement activity has occurred,the State still has not met the seven month enforcement cycle. While timelinessimproved during the second year, the State still has not met this crucialdesign parameter. As a result, many subject vehicles are in non-compliancewith program requirements.While USEPA is proposing to approve the enforcement portion of the I/Mprogram, prior to USEPA making a final decision on approving the enforcementportion, the State must demonstrate that it has improved the timelinessto be within the design parameter and that all subject vehicles receivean annual test during the actual annual cycle.If the State is not able to make this demonstration, then the enforcementprogram will not meet USEPA requirements for routine and expeditious enforcementor for preventing noncomplying vehicles from operating on the road andUSEPA, therefore, will have to reconsider its position on the approvabilityof the enforcement portion of the I/M program.At this time, USEPA also proposes to approve the Transportation ControlMeasures as part of the Ozone and CO SIPs. The State's CO attainment demonstrationand the CO plan as a whole are also being proposed for approval.<ITAG tagnum="84">Solicitation of Public Comment</ITAG>Public comment is solicited on these proposed SIP revisions and on USEPA'sproposed rulemaking action approving their incorporation into the Ozoneand CO SIPs. Public comments received by the date indicated above willbe considered in the development of USEPA's final rulemaking action.USEPA has published several proposed rulemaking actions on the IllinoisOzone and CO SIPs, including February 3, 1983 (48 FR 5110), August 3, 1983(48 FR 35315), May 4, 1984 (49 FR 19039), August 15, 1984 (49 FR 32601)and July 14, 1987 (52 FR 26424). These plans have been revised substantiallysince each rulemaking was published. As a result, USEPA believes that publiccomments submitted in response to these earlier proposed rulemaking actionsare outdated. Consequently, USEPA does not intend to address public commentsreceived in response to earlier proposed rulemaking actions in the developmentof its final rule.Commentors who believe that all or a portion of the comments they submittedin response to earlier proposed rulemaking actions remain germaine to thisaction and should be answered, should resubmit their comments. The relevanceof any resubmitted comment to this proposed rulemaking should be explained.USEPA will then reconsider any earlier comment in relation to the State'scurrent Plan.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of the Executive Order 12291.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator has certified that SIP approvalsdo not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.
