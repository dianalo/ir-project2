The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said Japanese exports of cars, trucks and buses rose 6.8% in January from a year earlier, to 577,533 units, a record for the month. The increase was the first in seven months. &quot;It's very encouraging,&quot; an association official said. He added, however, that chances for continued rapid growth are slim because of the impact of the strong yen, which raises the cost of Japanese exports, and because of continued pressure from other nations for Japan to restrain exports.    Separately, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation said steel exports fell 9.5% in January from a year earlier, to 1.9 million metric tons. The decline marked the first time that monthly exports had fallen below the two million-ton level since January 1983. Last month was the fifth consecutive month in which exports fell.    In another report, the Japan Foreign Trade Council said that export contracts concluded by 13 major trading companies fell 25% in January from a year earlier, indicating that Japanese trade will remain stagnant in the short term. And the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said production at Japan's factories and mines, which has been faltering because of the yen's strength, rose 0.2% in January from the year before, the second consecutive monthly increase.    Despite the increase, officials said the January statistics indicated that the economy remained in the doldrums, but they predicted that industrial production will accelerate in coming months. </TEXT></DOC>
