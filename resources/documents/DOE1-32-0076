Results are shown for cleanliness monitoringon ground and in vacuum best by Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) andby analysis of witness mirror samples with Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry(SIMS) and X-ray reflection measurements. Some unexpected contaminationeffects have had considerable impacts onto contamination control measures,especially onto specification of contamination witness samples, and theyrequested intense efforts with respect to contamination analysis. Theseinvestigations showed that there are considerable impurities of hydrocarbonstrapped within the evaporated gold layers, caused by residual hydrocarbonsin the evaporation facility or resulting from an unusually high affinityto hydrocarbon contamination compared to bulk gold. The latter may bestimulated by structural properties of the evaporated gold layer.</TEXT></DOC>
