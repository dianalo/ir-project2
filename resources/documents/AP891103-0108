A crowd estimated by police at about 25,000 gathered to denouncePresident Corazon Aquino for blocking the return of Marcos' body.It was the largest show of support for the former president inyears and came on the eve of Mrs. Aquino's trip to Canada and theUnited States, where she hopes to convince business leaders thather country is stable for investment.   Among those participating were Vice President Salvador Laurel,opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile and other former officials of theMarcos administration.   Protesters defied police orders and marched to Camp Crame,headquarters of the Philippine Constabulary military police force,and nearby Camp Aguinaldo, the armed forces headquarters.   Police blocked the road about a mile from the camps, but theprotesters pushed through, and several thousand reached the gate ofCamp Crame.   Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, a senior military commander, agreedto let them rally at the gate because he said the crowd was too bigto disperse. Later, the military said the rally must end but itmade no move toward the protesters.   By late Friday the crowd estimated at 15,000 people refused todisperse by midnight (11 a.m. EST), but their leaders thennegotiated an agreement to leave at 5:30 a.m. Saturday (4:30 p.m.EST Friday).   Armed troops stood guard. Several firetrucks were brought intothe garrison, apparently to disperse protesters if they tried tostorm the camp.   Riot police on one truck flashed the ``V-for-Victory'' sign,associated here with the Marcos movement. Marcos supporters chanted``Thank you, Thank you!''   Marcos died Sept. 28 in Honolulu, where he had lived since beingousted in a 1986 civilian-military uprising that swept Mrs. Aquinoto power.   In a statement broadcast by pro-Marcos radio station DZEC, thelate president's son, Ferdinand Jr., said the demonstration was areaction to the ``arrogance'' of the Aquino administration.''   ``I congratulate the marchers for their steadfast and courageousactions,'' the statement said. ``You show to the world, although weare a moderate, patient people, we Filipinos will not compromiseprinciples.''   The rally in suburban Quezon City climaxed an 11-day march fromMarcos' home province, Ilocos Norte, to demand that Mrs. Aquinoallow Marcos' body to be buried here.   The crowd cheered wildly as Laurel asked: ``Do you agree thatMarcos' body must be allowed home?''   ``It is now very clear what the people want,'' Laurel said.``You are a very powerful force. The government must follow thepeoples' will. If not, you know what to do.''   He described the ban on the return of Marcos' body as ``theworst mistake'' Mrs. Aquino had made in office.   Although vice president, Laurel resigned as foreign secretary in1987 because of policy differences with Mrs. Aquino. Last May,Laurel and Enrile reorganized the Nacionalista party as the majorcenter-right opposition movement and have been seeking support fromMarcos' supporters.   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Gen. Renato de Villa orderedsoldiers not to join the protest. Marcos still enjoys support amongthe rank-and-file of the 160,000-member armed forces.   The crowd was the largest mustered in Manila by the loyalistssince rallies in 1986 shortly after Marcos was overthrown andforced into exile. In recent months, crowds at loyalist rallieshave numbered only a few hundred.   March organizers appealed to Filipinos to join the protest as agesture of dissatisfaction with the Aquino government.   Protesters distributed handbills warning that the nation wasfacing civil unrest by the Communists. It urged people to stock upon food, water and essentials as well as enough cash to buy tickets``to a safe haven for your family.''   On Oct. 27, the Supreme Court upheld Mrs. Aquino's ban, whichalso prevents Marcos' widow, Imelda, and their three children fromreturning. The court ruled 8-7 that the return of the family wouldendanger national security.   Last year, a federal grand jury in New York indicted Marcos andhis wife on racketeering charges in connection with the allegedlooting of the Philippine treasury during his 20-yearadministration.   Imelda Marcos was freed on $5 million bail and is to stand trialin March.</TEXT></DOC>
