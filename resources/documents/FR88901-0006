Thomas, </T3>838 F.2d 1224 (1988). In that case the U.S. Courtof Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that USEPA had not adequately explainedcertain provisions of its July 8, 1985, stack height regulations and remandedthese provisions to USEPA for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.If USEPA's response to the <T3>NRDC </T3>remand modifies the applicable July 8, 1985, provision(s),USEPA will notify the State of Indiana whether the emission limit for GeneralElectric_Mt. Vernon in Posey County, PSI_Wabash River in Vigo County, and/orHoosier Energy_Merom in Sullivan County must be reexamined for consistencywith the modified provision. USEPA's approval of these facilities' emissionlimits today is intended to avoid delay in the establishment of federallyenforceable emission limits for all sources in Posey, Vigo, and SullivanCounties, respectively, while awaiting resolution of the <T3>NRDC </T3>remand. This issue is discussed further in the Stack Heightsection of today's notice below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Response to Public Comments </ITAG>The Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM), the IndianapolisPower and Light Company (IPALCO), the Peabody Coal Company (Peabody), andthe Save the Dunes Council (SDC) submitted comments in response to theNotice of Proposed Rulemaking. A summary of the public comments, and USEPA'sresponses, are provided below. LaPorte County <T3>Comment: </T3>SDC objected to the proposed LaPorte County plan, especiallythe emission limit for Unit 12 at NIPSCO-Michigan City, for the followingreasons: (a) IDEM's air quality analysis did not consider lake effects, did notconsider the synergistic effects of plant emissions and the cooling toweremissions leading to the formation of acid rain or acid mist, and reliedon upper air data from Flint, Michigan. (b) IDEM did not consider the impact of the increased allowable emissionsfrom Unit 12 on the adjacent Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, an areawhere, according to the commentor, the effects of air pollution on vegetationhave been observed and the existing rainfall is already more acid thannormal. (c) The rule does not impose any restriction on annual hours of operationon Unit 12. <T3>Response: </T3>USEPA has reviewed the issues raised by the commentorand has concluded that the proposed plan is approvable. Each issue is addressedbelow: (a) IDEM followed USEPA's modeling guidelines pertaining to attainmentdemonstrations. The models and input data (including mixing height datafrom the closest National Weather Service Station, i.e., Flint, Michigan)were selected and applied consistent with USEPA's guidelines. AlthoughUSEPA's models are designed to predict concentrations under a wide varietyof conditions, USEPA does not have refined techniques to address the additionaleffects (e.g., lake-induced fumigation and cooling tower interactions)cited by the commentor. Because the commentor has provided no evidencethat these effects will result in ambient concentrations which violateany applicable requirements of the Act, USEPA accepts the State's attainmentdemonstration. (b) While the proposed emission limit for Unit 12 (i.e., 6.0 pounds ofsulfur dioxide per million British Thermal Units_lbs/MMBTU) does representan increase from the previous State rule (i.e., 5.3 lbs/MMBTU), it is notan increase from the plan which USEPA conditionally approved on March 12,1982, i.e., an emission limit of 6.0 lbs/MMBTU for Unit 12. On May 11,1984, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit set aside thisapproval, effectively revoking the federally enforceable emission limit.Thus, USEPA has proposed to establish a Federal limit where none now exists;not to increase a limit. In any case, the Act requires demonstration that this limit ensures attainmentand maintenance of the SO<T2>2 </T2> NAAQS. Under section 109 of the Act, USEPA set the NAAQS toprotect both the public health and welfare, e.g., vegetation. Thus, USEPAmust assume, based on its analyses in setting the standards, that a proposedset of emission limits that protect the NAAQS will also protect the publichealth and welfare. As noted above, IDEM has provided a modeled demonstrationof attainment of the primary and secondary SO<T2>2 </T2> NAAQS, which USEPA is accepting as sufficient technical supportfor the LaPorte County plan. (c) A restriction on hours of operation per year is required only if neededto demonstrate attainment of the NAAQS. The State's modeling analysis assumedall sources, including Unit 12, operating every hour of the year at fullload. This modeling showed attainment of the 3-hour, 24-hour and annualNAAQS at the proposed emission limits under these conditions. Therefore,there is no need to impose any restriction on annual operating hours onany source.Marion County <T3>Comment: </T3>In response to a discussion in USEPA's March 3, 1988,proposal on Indiana's Marion County dispersion modeling technique, IDEMemphasized that its ``hybrid'' modeling approach in Marion County is moreconservative than if urban and rural areas were modeled separately andthe monitored background concentrations were used. (For a description ofthis modeling approach, please see USEPA's proposal and technical supportdocuments.) <T3>Response: </T3>USEPA acknowledges and accepts the State's modelingapproach in Marion County. <T3>Comment: </T3>IPALCO objected to USEPA's proposed reliance on a February1, 1988, letter from the State in the SIP. This letter clarified how theState intends to enforce its rules for sources with variable operatinglimits. IPALCO claimed that the letter is without legal status becauseit was never the subject of any public notice or hearing, never includedin any administrative record or public hearing record, and does not reflectthe intentions of the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board. Consequently,it cannot be regarded as a part of the Indiana SIP. IPALCO requested thatUSEPA (1) approve the Mario County plan, and (2) make it clear in the noticeof final rulemaking that the February 1, 1988, letter is merely a statementof IDEM enforcement policy and that the primary method of compliance willbe a stack test. <T3>Response: </T3>USEPA agrees that the primary method of compliance willbe a stack test and that this is the sole methodology which assures thatthe Indiana SO<T2>2</T2> plan will assure the attainment and maintenance of the SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS.USEPA acknowledges that IDEM's February 1, 1988, letter, as clarified bythe State's June 24, 1988, letter, represents the State's enforcement policy.The policy explains how the 30-day averaging provisions of 325 IAC 7-1-3will be applied to sources with variable operating limits. Because theseletters reflect State policy and not State regulation, USEPA agrees thatit is not necessary to include them within the SIP. USEPA does, however,intend to enforce the 30-day averaging provisions in 325 IAC 7-1-3 forthe four affected sources consistent with the State's intent expressedin its February 1, 1988, and June 24, 1988, letters. USEPA notes that attainmentand maintenance of the NAAQS are not dependent upon the methodology bywhich Indiana (and USEPA) enforces the 30-day averaging provisions of Indiana'srule, but on the stack test compliance methodology.  IDEM intends to submit this methodology, as detailed in its February 1,1988, letter, to the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board for its considerationas a revision to Indiana rules. See IDEM's June 24, 1988, letter. USEPAwill rulemake on this addition to the Indiana SIP upon the State's submittalof it as a revision.  Finally, the variable nature of the emission limits for IPALCO-Perry K,IPALCO-Stout, and Allison Gas Turbine in Marion County and NIPSCO-MichiganCity in LaPorte County necessitates special recordkeeping and reportingrequirements. The recordkeeping and reporting requirements included inthe Marion and LaPorte County plans for these four sources are approvable. <T3>Vermillion County  </T3>Comment: Peabody supported the proposed rule for Vermillion County. TheCompany noted that the March 1, 1989, compliance date will allow Peabodyto continue to supply coal to the Public Service of Indiana Cayuga plantwhile it makes the changes to its mining operations necessary to meet theproposed emission limit in an economical manner.  <T3>Response: </T3>USEPA acknowledges this comment.  <T3>Vigo County  </T3><T3>Comment: </T3>On February 3, 1988, IDEM submitted a revised Vigo Countyplan for parallel processing. IDEM stated in its comments that it anticipatedthat the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board would adopt this revised VigoCounty rule in final on June 8, 1988. However, IDEM noted that the rulemay not be promulgated and effective at the State level until at leastAugust 1988. IDEM will attempt to expedite the State process.  <T3>Response: </T3>The Board did adopt the revised Vigo County plan onJune 8, 1988, and submitted it to USEPA on the date the plan was publishedin the <T3>Indiana Register, </T3>August 1, 1988. USEPA is currently under courtorder to take final rulemaking on Vigo County by July 29, 1988. However,USEPA delayed slightly its final rulemaking action on Indiana's Vigo Countyplan in order to accommodate Indiana's delayed rulemaking schedule.  <T3>Stack Height Issues  </T3>Comment: IDEM questioned USEPA's characterization of the potential impactof the reent court remand of portions of USEPA's stack height regulations.IDEM believes that, even if the regulations are subsequently revised, itis not certain that the emission limits for the sources identified in theNotice of Proposed Rulemaking would change. IDEM disagreed with USEPA'simplication that a change in limits is more likely than not.  <T3>Response: </T3>On January 22, 1988 the U.S. Court of Appeals for theDistrict of Columbia Circuit issued its decision in <T3>NRDC v. Thomas, </T3>838 F.2d 1224 (1988), regarding the stack heightregulations published on July 8, 1985 (50 FR 27892). Subsequent petitionsfor rehearing were denied. Although the court upheld most provisions ofthe rules, three portions were remanded to USEPA for review: (1) Grandfatheringpre-October 11, 1983, within formula stack height increases from demonstrationrequirements [40 CFR 51.100(kk)(2)]; (2) Dispersion credit for sourcesoriginally designed and constructed with merged or multiflue stacks [40CFR 51.100(hh)(2)(ii)(A)]; and (3) Grandfathering of pre-1979 use of therefined ``H + 1.5L formula height'' [40 CFR 51.100(ii)(2)]. If USEPA wereto change any of these provisions, then the emission limitations for somesources might need to be revised. At this time, USEPA has not determinedwhether or how the regulations would be changed. Consequently, it is prematureto speculate on the need for or degree of emission limit changes. USEPAmerely wishes to notify the State that the emission limits for some sourcesmay be affected by the <T3>NRDC </T3>remand and may require changes at a later date.  <T3>General (Non-Court Specific) Comments  </T3><T3>Comment: </T3>IDEM urged USEPA to approve the rules for these eightcounties in final form.  <T3>Response: </T3>USEPA acknowledges this comment.  <T3>Conclusion: </T3>USEPA is approving Indiana's rules and the plans forJefferson, Marion, LaPorte, Posey, Sullivan, Vermillion, Vigo, and WayneCounties. This approval for LaPorte, Marion, Vigo, and Wayne Counties includesUSEPA's approval of these counties as meeting, for SO<T2>2</T2>, all the requirements of Part D.  The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof Section 3 of Executive Order 12291.  Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by (60 days from today.). This action may not be challenged laterin proceedings to enforce its requirements.
