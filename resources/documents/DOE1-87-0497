Data on the behavior of multiphaseflow through MOV chokes have not been available in the past. This studyinvestigated high-pressure (400 to 800 psia [2.8 to 5.5 MPa]), two-phaseair/water flow through a 2-in. [5.1-cm] MOV choke. Single-phase air andwater data were obtained to determine the valve-sizing coefficient, C/subv/. A correlating parameter was determined with two-phase data to predictthe subcritical two-phase pressure drop. This parameter was found tobe a function of the gas/liquid ratio, upstream pressure, and choke opening.A mathematical model based on experimental observations was developedto predict the subcritical pressure drop across the choke for single-phaseliquid flow.</TEXT></DOC>
