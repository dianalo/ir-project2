Late Thursday, the investor Asher Edelman launched a $65-a-share bid for the Tulsa, Okla., maker of telecommunications gear and telephone systems, saying he and a related group hold a 7.8% stake in the company.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Telex shares closed at $70.375 a share, up $9.375, on volume of more than 3.3 million shares.    Some Wall Street traders said that the stock climbed on expectations that Mr. Edelman's offer was just a starting bid, and that the investor might sweeten the tender offer price.    &quot;Asher starts off cheap and then goes higher,&quot; said one trader. Indeed, Mr. Edelman sweetened tender offers for Fruehauf Corp., Ponderosa Inc. and Burlington Industries Inc.    Other traders said that they believed that based on other high-technology companies, some of which trade at as much as 20 times their earnings, Telex is sorely undervalued. Moreover, they said, the company has relatively few anti-takeover defenses and is a vulnerable target compared with many companies.    But some analysts were skeptical about whether Telex could be regarded as an undervalued company. &quot;We believe they're in a matured business,&quot; said Stephen Cohen, vice president of Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner Securities Corp., a brokerage that specializes in high-technology stocks. Telex, Mr. Cohen added, &quot;is probably past its peak.&quot;    A spokeswoman for Telex declined to comment, except to say the company will respond to the offer &quot;within several days.&quot;    Mr. Cohen said that the bulk of Telex's revenue in recent years has come from manufacturing, selling and servicing terminals that attach to International Business Machines Corp. mainframes. Many users of these terminals are beginning to replace them with personal computers, which can provide many more functions.    While Telex has been striving to diversify and has developed personal computer-type products, it is facing strong competition for its customer base from IBM, Apple Computer Inc., Compaq Computer Corp. and others, Mr. Cohen said. </TEXT></DOC>
