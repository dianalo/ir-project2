The former chairman, Govan Mbeki, who along with Mr. Mandela was convicted of sabotage and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964, was released from Robben Island prison in Table Bay near Cape Town and flown to Port Elizabeth to be reunited with his wife. Mr. Mbeki, who is 77 years old, is one of seven black ANC members who were convicted at the famous Rivonia sabotage trial, and is the first to be freed.    At a news conference in Port Elizabeth last night, the white-haired Mr. Mbeki, dressed in a suit, said, &quot;I was informed I was being released unconditionally.&quot;    He said, &quot;The ideas for which I went to jail and for which the ANC stands, I still embrace.&quot; The ANC is committed to the overthrow of South Africa's white minority government and includes terrorism as part of its strategy.    The government hasn't specified its reasons for yesterday's action, other than to say it was part of a &quot;continuous process.&quot; But over the past several weeks, government sources and political analysts have been speculating that the release of Mr. Mbeki might serve to test the waters for a possible release of Mr. Mandela, who is 69. Mr. Mandela is considered by a large portion of the black community to be their political leader, even though many in the community are too young to have ever seen him or heard him speak. In South Africa, it is illegal to quote Mr. Mandela or to publish a photo of him.    The reaction of the black community over the next several weeks will be watched closely by the government, which wants to gauge the impact of the release of Mr. Mbeki, who is also highly revered. Should his release inspire a new round of anti-government activity, the government may rethink any inclination it has to release Mr. Mandela. But should Mr. Mbeki's freedom and presence have a calming effect, the government might be emboldened to give Mr. Mandela his freedom, perhaps, some sources speculated, as soon as sometime next year.    Another factor behind yesterday's release is that the government didn't want Mr. Mbeki, who is said to be in poor health, to die in jail. Government sources said Pretoria also is wary of the certain outcry and unrest that would ensue should Mr. Mandela, who also has had health problems, die in his cell in Pollsmoor Prison, which is also near Cape Town.    An ANC spokesman in Lusaka, Zambia, the group's headquarters in exile, said Mr. Mbeki's release was greeted with &quot;joy and renewed determination.&quot; Thabo Mbeki, one of Mr. Mbeki's sons, is a member of the ANC's executive committee in Lusaka.    Inside South Africa, black activists welcomed Mr. Mbeki's release, but noted that many other black leaders remained in jail. &quot;He is welcomed home, but our demands for the release of all political prisoners remain,&quot; said Albertina Sisulu, a leader of the United Democratic Front anti-apartheid coalition and the wife of Walter Sisulu, who was jailed with Messrs. Mandela and Mbeki.    Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said: &quot;If the government wants to do something dramatic to influence an intractable situation, it should release all our leaders.&quot;    The release of Mr. Mbeki came as the government is trying to involve black leaders in discussions for a new constitution. So far, most blacks have rejected participation, saying that one of their conditions is the release of all political prisoners, including Mr. Mandela.    Many foreign governments, including the U.S., have said that one of the reasons for imposing economic sanctions on South Africa is the continued imprisonment of people like Messrs. Mandela and Mbeki. The government is hoping that Mr. Mbeki's release will soften some of this criticism.    In Washington, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker said the release was a &quot;positive step.&quot;    In past years, the government always has insisted that a renunciation of violence was a precondition for the release of any political prisoner. But earlier this year, State President P.W. Botha seemed to back away from that somewhat when he said that the cases of imprisoned black leaders would be periodically considered and that renunciation of violence would no longer be the sole determinant.    Mr. Mbeki said he plans to stay in South Africa, although he would like to visit his sons in exile. &quot;As far as I'm concerned personally, I don't have any major plans,&quot; he added. &quot;But probably one of the most important things is to apply oneself to the problems of the country, which are also my problems.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
