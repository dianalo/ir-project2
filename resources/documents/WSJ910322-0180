German Finance Minister Theo Waigel will travel toWashington next week, where war costs will be one item on hisagenda.</LP><TEXT>   The questioning from Bonn is certain to stir grumbling inthe U.S., particularly in Congress, where many politicianshave said some of the U.S.'s allies in the conflict with Iraqare failing to fulfill pledges of financial support. OnTuesday, the Senate passed a bill that would ban arms salesto allies, including Germany, until they come up with thepromised cash.   The dispute comes at a sensitive moment in Germany'srelations with the U.S. The Bonn government was blastedduring the early weeks of the January-February conflict forits lukewarm support of the U.S.-led military effort.However, Bonn eventually became one of the largest financialcontributors to the war, pledging $6.6 billion to the U.S.alone -- including $5.5 billion in direct cash paymentsannounced in February.   It is these payments, earmarked for the first part of whatwas expected to be a much longer conflict, which are now thefocus of attention. In a statement released in Bonnyesterday, the government said it intends to make all itsfinancial contributions, including the final payment due tothe U.S. at the end of this month.   &quot;But we also have to find out what the final cost will be,which is a legitimate question,&quot; says an aide to GermanChancellor Helmut Kohl. &quot;I'm sure other governments areequally interested in knowing.&quot;   That may be true, but the main motivation for Bonn'sinquiry is domestic politics.   Mr. Kohl's government recently unveiled a massive taxincrease that the German leader attributed to the unexpectedcosts of paying for the war and economic aid for EasternEurope. The opposition Social Democrats, however, say the taxboost is mainly for the spiraling costs of rebuilding easternGermany. The Social Democrats were beaten in last year'selections after they said tax increases would be inevitableto pay for German unification.   It isn't surprising, then, that the Social Democratsjumped on reports from the U.S. Congress that suggested thecosts of the war might be less than the total of alliedfinancial contributions. Some party leaders even accused theU.S. of trying to make a profit on the conflict. But the maintarget of their attacks was Mr. Kohl -- whom they now hope topressure into conceding that the new taxes are needed foreastern Germany.   &quot;The real source of this problem is the {U.S.} Congress,&quot;says one German government official. &quot;They toss aroundfigures that the opposition in our own Parliament can useagainst us.&quot;   Against this background, Bonn has little choice but toraise the question about war costs with Washington. Mr.Kohl's government is suffering a steep decline in popularity,with western Germans disgruntled about new taxes and easternGermans pouring onto the streets to protest the economicdepression spreading in the former Communist-ruled part ofthe country. If the government appeared to be giving awaymoney to Washington at a time like this, the backlash at homemight grow even stronger.   The bottom line, however, is unlikely to change. Germanofficials acknowledge that Washington has said the final warcosts are likely to be close to -- if not beyond -- theamount of allied contributions, which total $60 billion.There's also the question of paying for maintaining orwithdrawing the military forces now in the Gulf. Germanofficials say this is one of the issues Mr. Waigel is hopingto clarify in his talks Monday and Tuesday.   Even if some money does come back to Bonn, it's unlikelyto do much to help Mr. Waigel. The costs of salvaging easternGermany are skyrocketing, and Germans are likely to be askedto provide even more assistance to Eastern Europeangovernments as well as to help fund postwar reconstruction inthe Persian Gulf.</TEXT></DOC>
