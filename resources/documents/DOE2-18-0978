A model of the compact tokamak with ignition withthe following parameters: aspect ratio of plasma filament A-5; the largeradius of plasma filament 2.2 m; the small radius- 0.44 m; the diverter-poloidal,two-zero; stretch by the vertical 1.7; current in the plasma filament3.8 MA; plasma density in the burning regime, average 6-8x10/sup 14/cm/sup -3/, on the axis 1-5x10/sup 15/ cm/sup -3/; temperature on theaxis 10 keV; ignition margin 1-2; heating before ignition by means ofion cyclotron resonance at negligible He/sup 3/ addition addition, f=104mHz, P/sub HF/=12 MW; heating duration 3-5 s, is considered. Systemsof a poloidal field and HF-heating, a discharge chamber and a power supplysystem are described. Stress-deformed state as well as strength of theelectromagnetic system and discharge chamber are considered. 10 figs.;9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
