<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-50-0268 </DOCNO><TEXT>The permeation rate of deuterium through nickel exposed to a deuteriumion beam has been measured as a function of temperature (100-1000/sup0/C), incident ion flux (0.2-1.1x10/sup 15/ D-atom cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/),incident ion energy (1-2.5 keV/D-atom), and deuterium partial pressure.The results are analyzed with a model which is developed to describeion driven permeation when gas driven permeation coexists; the rate-limitingprocess of recycling during ion implantation is identified as surfacerecombination above 400/sup 0/C and as bulk diffusion below 300/sup 0/C,and the recombination coefficient is estimated. The model predicts thewhole parameter dependence observed. The permeation spike is also investigated.</TEXT></DOC>
