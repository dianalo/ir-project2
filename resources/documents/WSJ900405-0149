The Energy Department will provide $185 million of thecost for the unit, which burns coal more efficiently and withless polluting emissions than standard boilers. AmericanElectric will provide the remaining funds.</LP><TEXT>   The technology hasn't previously been employed infull-scale utility plants in North America, American Electricsaid. Fluidized bed plants burn pulverized coal in thepresence of limestone, which removes most of the sulphurdioxide, and lower operating temperatures reduce emissions ofnitrogen oxides. Those compounds are responsible for acidrain and other pollution problems.   Preliminary engineering design for the facility is underway, American Electric said. The study includes a detailedevaluation of repowering a unit at the utility's Philip Sporngenerating plant in New Haven, W.Va., with a 330,000-kilowattfluidized bed combustion unit, or building a completely newfacility, the company said.   A fluidized bed unit at the Sporn plant would startcommercial operation in 1996, American Electric said, butadditional environmental studies would delay start-up of acompletely new facility until 1998.   American Electric this year will begin operating a70,000-kilowatt unit employing the new technology at amothballed generating plant in Brilliant, Ohio. That unit isa joint project with the Energy Department and the Ohio CoalDevelopment Office, a state agency.</TEXT></DOC>
