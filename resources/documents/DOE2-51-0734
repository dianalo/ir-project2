The magnet is a conventional tape-woundquadrupole electromagnet, using iron pole- pieces, with the additionof permanent magnet material (neodymium iron) between the poles to reducethe effects of saturation. The iron is preloaded with magnetic flux generatedby the permanent magnet material, resulting in an asymmetrical saturationcurve. Since the polarity of the quadrupole magnets in a drift tube linacis not reversed we can take advantage of this asymmetrical saturationto provide greater focusing strength. The magnet configuration has beenoptimized and the vanadium permendur poles needed in a conventional quadrupolehave been replaced with iron poles. The use of permanent magnet materialhas allowed us to increase the focusing strength of the magnet by about20% over that of a conventional tape-wound quadrupole. Comparisons willbe made between this magnet and the conventional tape-wound quadrupole.3 refs., 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
