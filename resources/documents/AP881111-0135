The board stepped in at the request of Northwest Chairman StevenRothmeier.   Members of the Air Line Pilots Association voted overwhelminglyMonday through Thursday to set a midnight strike deadline. But awalkout is illegal under mediation, and the union will not strike,said spokesman Tim Barzen.   Contract talks between the carrier and pilots reached an impasseNov. 1 over wages, work rules and fringe benefits. Union spokesmanPete Quortrup said negotiators disagree on more than 100 issues.   With 85 percent of the union's pilots voting this week, nearly 97percent said they would support a strike, union spokesman AndyMurphy said today.   Under mediation, wages and work rules remain unchanged. Mediatorshandle negotiations until there is a settlement or an impasse, atwhich point the board will offer arbitration.   If either side rejects the offer, there would be a 30-day coolingoff period before Northwest could impose a contract or the unioncould strike.   ``We intend to schedule mediation sessions at an early date. Assoon as we get someone available,'' said Charles Barnes, executivedirector of the National Mediation Board in Washington.   Redmond Tyler, a Northwest spokesman, said the threat of a strikedid not appear to affect ticketing for flights over the weekend.   Pilots are flying under two contracts _ one covering 2,000 pilotswho flew for Republic Airlines before its 1986 merger withNorthwest, the other covering 2,800 pilots who flew for Northwest orhave been hired since the merger.</TEXT></DOC>
