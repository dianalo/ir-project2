From the Commonwealth summit meeting in distant Malaysia thisweek, Mrs. Thatcher consolidated her status as a dominant figure inSouth Africa's political disputes.   Her determined opposition to tougher economic sanctions againstSouth Africa was praised by conservative whites and denounced byanti-apartheid leaders.   ``Thank you, Maggie,'' said an editorial Tuesday in The Citizen,a pro-government Johannesburg daily. ``We South Africans appreciateyour brave, honest and lone battle against sanctions.''   President F.W. de Klerk, in a speech Monday night, lauded theleader of Britain's Conservative Party and said intensifiedsanctions would undermine his proposals for political reform.   Murphy Morobe, a senior spokesman for the anti-apartheidmovement, said with understatement that Mrs. Thatcher's position``does not coincide with ours.'' Moses Mayekiso, a black tradeunion leader, said Mrs. Thatcher went to the summit ``to defend theapartheid regime.''   The 49-nation Commonwealth, composed of Britain and its formercolonies, adopted a declaration Sunday calling for tougherfinancial measures against South Africa and giving the white-ledgovernment six months to fulfill promises to dismantle apartheid.   The declaration incorporated Mrs. Thatcher's objections but anhour later, to the dismay of other participants, she issued aseparate statement outlining her reasons for dissent.   She said tougher sanctions will hurt South Africa's blacks andincrease white resistance to de Klerk's reform program.   On Tuesday she told a news conference in Kuala Lumpur, ``I am instep with the people of South Africa.''   South Africa, a former British colony, withdrew from theCommonwealth in 1961 as other members increased their demands thatit end its policies of racial separation.   Business Day, a Johannesburg-based financial newspaper oftencritical of the government, said Mrs. Thatcher performed morehonorably at Kuala Lumpur than two pro-sanctions advocates, PrimeMinisters Robert Hawke of Australia and Brian Mulroney of Canada.   Hawke and Mulroney ``have found in South Africa a rareopportunity for moral posturing,'' Business Day said. ``They don'tknow or care what harm they do.''   Mrs. Thatcher has ``the good sense to recognize fundamentalchanges when they occur, sufficient faith in human nature to dareto hope for better times, and the courage to back her judgment,''the editorial said. ``That is why she towers over men like Hawkeand Mulroney; even if she turns out in the end to be wrong, atleast she is not a pygmy.''   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate residential districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
