KISSEL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 3-year-old Texas girl unable to digest foodwas discharged from the hospital Friday, nearly three months afterundergoing a liver and small intestine transplant.   On her return home, her first meal, of all things, was airplanefood.   Tracey Kay Gonzales, of Corpus Christi, received a new liver andsmall intestine in a 14-hour operation in July. Her doctors say hersuccess will clear the way for transplants on others withlife-threatening intestinal defects.   The toddler's quick recovery won her a trip home. She left thehospital early Friday and, after weeks of hospital food and anoccasional meal away from the medical center, she graduated toairline food.   ``She'll eat anything,'' said Tracey's mother, Pam. ``Most ofthe time, she's talking about food: `Take me here or take me thereto eat.'''   Bessie Peters, in the billing department of the airline'scaterer, said passengers aboard Tracey's plane were served omeletswith cheddar cheese or turkey, muffins or croissants and orangejuice and milk.   When she arrived at the Corpus Christi airport, Tracey rushed tosee her two brothers, Gary, 10 and Tommy, 8, whom she last saw inApril.   She told them the first thing she wanted to do was to playfootball. However, doctors have said Tracey will not be able toplay contact sports.   Before undergoing surgery, the girl suffered from short gutsyndrome, in which the small intestine was too short to processfood sufficiently. She sustained liver damage on a high-proteindiet fed intravenously.   ``Before the transplant, she was eating. She has taste buds. Herbody just couldn't do anything with it,'' Children's Hospitalspokeswoman Sue Cardillo said Friday.   Tracey will return to Pittsburgh on Oct. 21 to begin outpatienttreatment.   While she's home, doctors will watch for signs of infection orrejection. Tracey is taking the experimental drug FK-506, whichdoctors say is safer and more potent than the common anti-rejectiondrug cyclosporin.   The drug made Tracey's operation possible, and the survival oftwo other transplant patients on FK-506 will make surgery possiblefor others, said transplant pioneer Dr. Thomas Starzl.   ``The bottom line is that intestinal transplants are going to bepractical and are going to be widely used,'' Starzl said.   Small-intestine transplants have a poor success rate. Since1983, one adult and three children have died within a year of theirsurgeries at Pittsburgh hospitals. One adult and a teen-ager arestill alive.   The small intestine transplanted into Tracey works just like herown would have if it had been healthy, with muscles moving the fooddown the digestive tract.   ``It's a little bit surprising. There were studies thatsuggested that that might not be possible,'' Starzl said.   While she had her dysfunctional old liver, Tracey retained waterand looked chubby Thursday night at the hospital. Dr. Jorge Reyessaid doctors would gauge Tracey's recovery by the amount of waterloss and muscle gain.   ``Part of the assessment is to see how her swelling is comingdown and how her lean muscle mass is building up,'' said Reyes,another of the girl's surgeons.   Since the surgery is new, it's difficult to measure progress, hesaid.   ``Her postoperative time was relatively uneventful and sherecovered in good time, but there's really nothing for a base tocompare it to,'' Reyes said.</TEXT></DOC>
