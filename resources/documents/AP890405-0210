The bill went to the House on a 82-16 vote, as senators rejectedan argument that the rewards would encourage Americans to spy oneach other and avoid their duty to report crimes solely out ofpatriotism, without getting paid.   The attorney general would have sole discretion to grant therewards from Justice Department funds, but he could seekcourt-ordered reimbursement later from criminal fines leviedagainst convicted violators.   Federal employees who furnish information in the performance ofofficial duties could not receive a reward, nor could those whothemselves violated the 1988 Major Fraud Act, which imposed stiffpenalties for contract fraud.   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, chief sponsor of the bill,said $250,000 ``is not a large amount of money when you're talkingabout multimillion dollar fraud.''   ``We are dealing with a serious problem and have to doeverything we can ... before tax dollars are lost and people areinjured. With better information, we can nip contract fraud in thebud,'' he said.   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., in emotional arguments, said the billwould encourage the type of neighbor-against-neighbor spying thatoccurred in Nazi Germany and in communist countries. But hisamendment to wipe out the proposed rewards was tabled by a vote of55-43.   ``I find the provision so repugnant, so repulsive, so demeaningthat we're giving up on America'' by paying people to do theircivic duty, Bumpers argued before the vote.   ``Are we caving in and saying, `There aren't enough patriots inthis country to do their job so we have to pay them ...?''' heasked. ``How much do we have to bribe'' informants?   To be eligible for the money, the informant must give hisinformation to his employer before contacting authorities, unlessthere is a valid reason not to do so. The whistleblower also couldnot collect if the information was previously disclosed, unless theinformant was the original source of the information.</TEXT></DOC>
