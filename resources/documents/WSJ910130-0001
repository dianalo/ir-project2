Cautious lending practices, plus a few basic structuraladvantages, have helped Canada's six big banks steer clear ofmost of the problems pummeling the U.S. industry. Assetquality is high, exposure to commercial real estate loans islow and the Canadian banks have largely kept away fromfinancing highly leveraged transactions.</LP><TEXT>   Canadian bank stocks have outperformed the Toronto StockExchange 300 index so far this year, just as they did in1990, when their declines were much smaller than those seenin the U.S., Japanese and United Kingdom banking industries.   Analysts such as Steven Kressler of Midland Walwyn Capitalare forecasting stock-price gains of 10% to 20% forindividual Canadian banks this year. Last year's declineshave pushed up dividend yields to attractive levels again,currently 4.1% to 9%.   The stocks are priced at multiples of 5 1/2 to 10 timesreported earnings, hardly a fancy price-earnings ratio. Thesix banks trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange, where they canbe bought and sold by American investors through U.S.brokerage firms doing business in Canada.   Many analysts have their fingers crossed about the shortterm because of the Mideast war and the recession, but theyrecommend the Canadian banking sector as a long-termpurchase.   Canadian institutions are buying. One of the country'sbiggest pension fund managers, Stephen Jarislowsky, has morethan 15% of his portfolio in bank stocks. Michael Sprung ofLaurentian Investment is accumulating them. &quot;I'm not asheavily weighted as I would like to be,&quot; he said.   Investors are buying selectively, however, largelyavoiding the two &quot;problem banks&quot;: National Bank of Canada andBank of Nova Scotia, which are on many analysts' sell lists.&quot;Problem bank&quot; means something less scary in Canada than inthe U.S. Investors worry about sluggish earnings rather thana collapse. &quot;We couldn't have a Bank of New England here,&quot;says Deutsche Bank's Toronto bank analyst Alain Tuchmaier.   Canadian institutions find they almost have to hold bankshares, which account for a much larger part of Canada'soverall stock-market scene than bank stocks do in the U.S.American analysts don't follow the Canadian banks much, andsome who do are skeptical.   Henry de Vismes, head of international investing forCitibank's private banking unit in New York, says Canadianbanks &quot;are going to struggle to make the same earnings&quot; thisyear, in part because he expects loan losses to increase.&quot;P/E ratios might look appealing,&quot; he says, but he'd bereluctant to invest in the banks until he sees &quot;significantcost-cutting leading to bigger earnings in 1991 and 1992.&quot; Hesays U.S. investors would be better off with high-growthstocks.   Still, Hugh Brown of Burns Fry in Toronto, said he's&quot;getting a lot more calls from U.S. institutional investors&quot;who are &quot;starting to understand the differences between thetwo {banking} systems.&quot;   Unlike many U.S. banks, &quot;most Canadian banks saw therecession coming and tightened credit standards,&quot; said KersiDoodha of Maison Placements. The Canadians learned theirlesson in the early 1980s, when Dome Petroleum defaulted onbillions of dollars of debt.   Commercial real-estate loans account for only 8% to 12% ofCanadian banks' total loan portfolios, much less than U.S.banks. About 65% of the Canadians' Third World loans havebeen written off, against only about 35% by their U.S.cousins, analysts said. Mr. Doodha said Canadian bankers areso cautious about real estate they won't lend to a shoppingmall development until anchor tenants have been found and 65%of the retail space has been rented.   All of the big six banks were profitable in the fiscalyear that ended Oct. 31. Rapidly falling interest rates inCanada point to improved profit margins from lending and tolower carrying costs for nonperforming loans.   With assets of 518 billion Canadian dollars (US$446billion) the six major banks control about 90% of the bankingassets in the country. Unlike U.S. banks, they can operatefrom coast to coast. Canada has a national banking system,and that translates into widely diversified deposits andloans that spread the risk around.   The national system gives the Canadian banks a strongfunding base in the form of cheap, low-risk deposits fromindividuals. All the Canadian banks have more deposits thanloans. In the U.S., the situation is often reversed, forcingthe banks to borrow money from more expensive sources tofinance lending. Royal Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank ofCommerce are at the top of most analysts' ratings. They arehuge and widely diversified across the country.   Bank of Montreal and Toronto-Dominion Bank come next.Toronto-Dominion is widely seen as Canada's best-run bank,but it is more heavily concentrated than the others inOntario, where the current recession is biting the hardest.   Bank of Nova Scotia has the highest exposure among thebanks to U.S. commercial real estate, and highly leveragedtransactions and nonperforming loans account for a largerpercentage of total loans than at the preceding four banks.At National Bank of Canada, the percentage is even higher.And the bank is comparatively more concentratedgeographically, in Quebec, where there is new uncertaintyabout the province's status within Canada. Caution aboutthese two banks is reflected in their steep dividend yields,now 7.8% for Bank of Nova Scotia and 9% for National Bank ofCanada.</TEXT></DOC>
