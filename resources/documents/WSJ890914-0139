The claim, made in federal bankruptcy court in Houston, signals the latest round in the fight over the remains of the once-huge holding company, which lost 20 of its 25 banks to regulators in March. MCorp subsequently filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and is currently trying to work out a plan to pay its debts.    In its most recent filing in the bankruptcy court, MCorp and two subsidiaries listed net liabilities of $595 million, not counting the FDIC's claims. The companies listed total assets, after adjustments for double-counting and intercompany debt, of $564 million. Those assets include $70 million that MCorp claims the FDIC owes it for allegedly manufacturing the insolvency of 12 healthy banks. A federal judge in Dallas recently indicated that he is likely to support MCorp in a related lawsuit against the regulatory agency.    In its bankruptcy-court filing, the FDIC relies on an unusual interpretation of the U.S. tax laws to demand the return of $316.5 million from MCorp. In essence, the regulatory agency charges that healthy banks in the holding company reduced their tax bill by utilizing tax-loss carry-forwards generated by unprofitable affiliate banks that later failed. The FDIC is demanding the return of those and other benefits.    The FDIC further alleges that MCorp overcharged its member banks for data processing services and extracted excessive dividends from banks that subsequently failed. Regulators also fault the holding company for allegedly taking unfair advantage of the 20 banks when it bought their credit-card operations.    Notably absent from its claims was any reliance on the so-called source of strength doctrine, a controversial and little-used power asserted by regulators to force a holding company to shore up failing affiliate banks. Before the bank failures, MCorp officials had fiercely resisted pumping any holding company assets into unhealthy units. &quot;It's a strong positive development,&quot; said one bondholder. &quot;That was the single largest threat to MCorp creditors' claims.&quot;    An MCorp spokesman said the company is still studying the FDIC claims and couldn't comment on specifics. But he added that, &quot;based on a preliminary assessment, the company believes the claims filed by the FDIC far exceed amounts which can be justified or substantiated.&quot;    Separately, several former MCorp officials have embarked on a controversial quest to have the bankruptcy court forgive several million dollars in personal loans from the company. Citing a provision of the loan agreement that would allow forgiveness in the event of a change in control, the former officers hired a Phoenix, Ariz., attorney to press their case in bankruptcy court.    The former officials, including James Gardner, a former group chairman, now work for Banc One Corp., the Columbus, Ohio, banking concern that took over MCorp's failed banks. The amount owed by the former officers wasn't immediately available, although the holding company lent a total of $8.8 million to several top officials as part of an executive benefit program.    Some politicians complain that the former employees should be forced to repay the loans, particularly in light of the enormous $2 billion cost to the FDIC of bailing out the failed banks.    But several MCorp creditors said they don't plan to contest the effort. &quot;We think it's the FDIC that's trying to take advantage of creditors, not management,&quot; said James Potter, an analyst for Craig-Hallum Inc., Minneapolis, who is advising some MCorp bondholders. </TEXT></DOC>
