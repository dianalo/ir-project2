The dispute between the Bank Board and Mr. Broad centers on the company's purchase of 1,905,000 of its common shares from financier Marvin L. Warner in 1985. At the time, the thrift obtained permission from federal regulators to buy the stock from Mr. Warner with company funds instead of having Mr. Broad, chairman of the thrift's executive committee, purchase the shares himself.    Federal regulators said then that the thrift's capital would have to be replaced. American Savings said that it has done so through various means, but that the Bank Board disagrees, contending that the thrift hasn't completely replaced the capital.    In Washington, a Bank Board spokeswoman declined to comment.    American Savings said a letter it received from a Bank Board supervisory agent stated that such a failure is ground for initiating regulatory action.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, American Savings closed at $17.25 a share, down 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
