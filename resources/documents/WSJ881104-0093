The two thrifts have total assets of about $9.5 billion, or about 10% of the Sandamp;L assets in the state, and an acquisition of them will require a significant amount of assistance from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.    Officials and executives familiar with the bidding process said at least six bids had been submitted for First Texas-Gibraltar. Some of the executives were here attending the convention of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the thrift industry's biggest trade group.    The initial bid that seemed most attractive to the FSLIC was submitted by a private investor group, the officials said; they didn't identify its members.    Other bids were submitted by Columbia Savings andamp; Loan Association, Beverly Hills, Calif.; Golden West Financial Corp., Oakland, Calif.; parent of World Savings andamp; Loan Association; Ford Motor Co., through its First Nationwide Bank unit; a joint venture of Landmark Land Corp., Carmel, Calif., and Ranieri Wilson andamp; Co., New York; and Reliance Group Holdings Inc., New York, which already is a major investor in First Texas-Gibraltar, supporting the company's present management.    The initial bids submitted by those five called for more assistance than the FSLIC wants to provide, the officials said, but some were asked to revise their proposals, which are expected to be submitted within two weeks.    First Texas officials couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.    Earlier this summer, First Texas submitted a plan to regulators that offered more than $250 million to help recapitalize the ailing thrifts in return for at least $100 million in aid from the FSLIC and other forms of regulatory assistance. It's unclear where that offer stands.    Columbia, known for its large holdings of junk bonds, said earlier this year it is interested in acquiring failed thrifts in Texas and California. Golden West has acquired a small thrift in Washington. Neither institution returned phone calls.    Ford tried repeatedly but unsuccessfully to acquire the nation's largest insolvent thrift, American Savings andamp; Loan Association of Stockton, Calif. However, Ford is expected to acquire, as early as today Lincoln Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Westfield, N.J.    Ranieri Wilson is headed by Lewis Ranieri, a former Salomon Brothers Inc. top executive who was a major player in the mortgage-backed securities and thrift industries. Mr. Ranieri and officials at Ford wouldn't comment. Reliance, which is controlled by New York investor Saul Steinberg, holds about a 10% stake in First Texas Financial. The management group backed by Reliance is led by J. Livingston Kosberg, the company's former chairman, who stepped down this week to concentrate on the proposed recapitalization.    &quot;I'm delighted and pleased that (the) FSLIC has begun to focus on reaching some resolution,&quot; Mr. Kosberg said. &quot;I'm hopeful that it would be accomplished in the first quarter of 1989.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
