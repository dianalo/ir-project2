Police estimated25 people were killed in Caracas alone and more than 1,000 arrested.   The violence, triggered by bus fare increases, began Monday andspread to at least seven cities and towns. It continued for a secondday today in Caracas, where sirens wailed as authorities put outfires and battled looters in streets filled with shattered glass.   Independent reports estimated damage nationwide to be in themillions of dollars. On some Caracas streets, virtually every storewas looted. The rioting eased in the early morning hours, thenresumed later in the day as troops moved against thieves carryingappliances and furniture from stores.   ``It is a popular uprising. There are riots everywhere. They areall furious,'' said Metropolitan Police Inspector Jose LaraMontilla, who commanded a unit armed with shotguns.   ``All police forces are in a state of emergency ... I cannot giveyou exact figures, but around 25 people have died and no one knowshow many injured,'' another police official said this morning.   ``Hospitals can no longer cope ... people just keep coming andcoming,'' said the police official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   The figures were for Caracas and outlying areas, he said, addingthat information from other parts of the country was not availableimmediately.   Army trucks full of troops patrolled some streets in Caracas thismorning, while blocks away looters continued to remove goods fromstores. ``We're waiting for orders,'' said a national guardsman,when asked why they were taking little action.   Perhaps the worst violence occurred Monday in Guarenas, ashantytown about 12 miles from the capital where the disturbancesbegan. People there formed human chains and threw rocks at nationalguard troops in armored cars after the soldiers began firingbirdshot and tear gas at looters.   A 32-year-old pregnant woman who was not involved in the riotingwas shot to death and at least 126 people were wounded, saidjournalist Igor Camacho of the Voz de Guarenas newspaper.   Rioters in the shantytown emptied dozens of stores andsupermarkets and set at least 14 vehicles ablaze.   Officially, bus fares were to rise only about 30 percent _ onurban routes, for example, from the equivalent of about a nickel to7 cents.   But Transportation Minister Gustavo Rada said today someincreases have been as high as 50 percent, apparently because ofprice gouging by bus drivers.   The increases are part of an economic reform package announcedlast week by the government of President Carlos Andres Perez.   Weak oil prices have seriously hurt the economy of Venezuela,which for decades has been one of South America's most stabledemocracies. More than 40 percent of Venezuelans live in poverty.   Perez appealed for calm, and said the rioting was``unjustifiable.'' However, opposition leaders called for continuedprotests against the government's economic program.   A woman caught in the crossfire Monday as she tried to get homecomplained the looters were criminals taking advantage of whatstarted out as a protest.   ``They're just criminals, robbing, burning. I've never seenanything this bad,'' she said, crying.   Fires in poor neighborhoods in the hills on the outskirts of thecity burned through the evening.   Residents in San Agustin del Sur took over the Francisco Fajardohighway, the city's main artery, on Monday. They fought a battlewith police that began with rocks and tear gas and ended withgunfire from both sides.   Drivers panicked and abandoned their cars on the highway. Publictransportation was brought to a standstill.   Alex Martinez, a deputy police commissioner, said Monday that all6,000 officers on the Caracas police force were called out and thatat least 100,000 people were stranded at work. The city's populationis nearly 4 million.   Three guardsmen were hurt by rocks thrown by students in Merida,more than 300 miles southwest of Caracas.   ``It's an outright battle between students and the nationalguard,'' said Ramon Suarez, a reporter for the newspaper Frontera inMerida, home to the 10,000 students of the University of the Andes.Tanks patrolled the streets.   Students took the state governor, Orlando Guttierez, prisoner forabout an hour Monday when he tried to talk to the rioters.   Two weeks after Perez was inaugurated Feb. 2, he announced hiseconomic austerity package, which includes food and gas priceincreases.   The country's $33 billion foreign debt is the fourth-largest inLatin America. Later this week, Venezuela is to sign a $1.5 billioncredit with the International Monetary Fund.   The last nationwide riots occurred in 1958 when dictator MarcosPerez Jimenez was ousted.</TEXT></DOC>
