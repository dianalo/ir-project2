They are talking about a newspaper photo ofGen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.   The picture was taken Wednesday, the day after Noriega surviveda coup attempt. He stands at a window at Panamanian Defense Forcesheadquarters, waving to a crowd.   Behind the general is an image _ not a person _ and they can'tmake it out. Some Panamanians do not rule out supernaturalintervention on Noriega's behalf.   It is said the general has a Haitian spiritual advisor, that heworships African gods. Clearly they are powerful, for he has putdown two coup attempts in 18 months and fended off the UnitedStates, which wants him out of office.   Many rumors roam the streets of Panama, where people fear thegeneral so much they are afraid to let it show.   On Oct. 3, Noriega was captured and held for five hours byrebels. But he survived, retained his post as head of the DefenseForces and his grip on power in Panama.   Now it is said the general will stop at nothing and Panamaniansfear nothing will stop him.   ``Blows for the undecided,'' Noriega said two days after theuprising. ``Lead for the enemy and silver for the friend.''   Officially, ten rebels died in the uprising, eight of themofficers. But there are rumors of trucks loaded with the corpses offallen mutineers.   Some reports say Noriega personally shot the leader of lastweek's abortive coup. ``You are a dead man,'' he is supposed tohave told Maj. Moises Giroldi, who withered and dropped his gun.   A list is being made of the disloyal, the government employeeswho do not enthusiastically support the general.   ``The list, the list, the list,'' Noriega said when he announcedthe purge. ``Names, names.''   On the day of the coup attempt, people thought the militarystrongman had fallen. They waved handkerchiefs or honked horns tocelebrate, while some danced in the streets. A few church bellsrang.   But Noriega didn't fall. And now he's taking down names.   Two days after the coup attempt Noriega's gunmen dispersed acrowd around opposition leader Guillermo Endara's office and senthim running with blows.   ``I did not hear anything. It is not good for me to hearanything,'' said a street vendor plying his trade a few yards away.   A homeowner lets in a stranger who wants to borrow a telephone.When he realizes the stranger is a journalist, his finger comesdown on the button to cut off the call in mid-conversation. ``Nopolitics here,'' he says.   Some taxi drivers won't pick up journalists. It would be bad forbusiness to be seen with a reporter who may want to go to unsafeplaces such as the cemetery where Giroldi was buried Monday.   One fallen rebel was refused burial in his family parish. Thepriest, a Defense Forces chaplain, had a choice between God andNoriega. He chose the general.   Noriega has taken on God before. His troops tear-gassed churcheswhen dissent was still public.   People avoided Mass the Sunday after the coup. Just in case.   Giroldi's widow did not attend his burial Monday. She and herthreee children were hidden at a U.S. military base, Fort Claytonafter the coup. The Washington Post reported today they and 36others were flown to the United States over the weekend.   ``They murdered him,'' Giroldi's mother cried, throwing herselfon the casket. She said he had been shot once in the head and twicein the chest.   A wreath of red carnations lay at the foot of the altar. ``Fromyour old friends,'' it said. No names.   The opposition, which once rallied tens of thousands in streetsand won the May 7 elections Noriega later annulled, sat out theuprising.   ``We'd just have been supplying the bodies,'' Christian Democratleader Ricardo Arias Calderon said later.   ``The truth is, we are all afraid,'' another opposition leadersaid.   Even the unkind nickname Noriega earned because of hispockmarked skin _ Pineapple Face _ has taken on new meaning. Thepineapple, people say, is the toughest of tropical fruits. Itdoesn't fall. It has spines.   Panamanians made their feelings about Noriega clear in Mayballoting. The United States also insists he has to go.   ``You'll have to kill me first,'' he said, facing the mutineers.He has made that perfectly clear.   The United States says the rebels weren't prepared to take thatstep. Nor were they prepared to hand Noriega over to face U.S. drugtrafficking indictments.</TEXT></DOC>
