You characterize banks as taking postions in derivativesalmost solely for purposes of betting on future interest andexchange rates. Actually, banks act mostly as dealers,earning fee income by making two-way markets for corporationsand financial institutions that rely on derivatives to hedgedangerous financial exposures. As a result, the increasedparticipation of large banks over the past decade has, infact, made these markets less risky because it permits allparties to diversify their risks better.</LP><TEXT>   The implications that risks from these &quot;off-balance-sheetactivities&quot; are somehow hidden &quot;behind the scenes&quot; is simplynot true. Banks' derivatives positions are disclosed fully toregulators in periodic reports and to the general public inpublished financial statements. In fact, since mostderivatives positions are &quot;marked to market&quot; on a dailybasis, information on potential losses is very timely andaccurate.   Finally, the measurement of the size of the market ($1.5trillion in interest-rate swaps) is stated in nominal termsand, therefore, overstates the true exposure of thesecontracts by a multiple of at least 5 to 10 times,particularly in light of the recent FIRREA legislationpermitting netting. When this economic reality is taken intoaccount, it is well-known that the default exposure from aportfolio of derivative securities is considerably less thanthe risk of a comparable portfolio of &quot;on-balance-sheet&quot;assets. It is no surprise, then, that your article concludedwith the admission that even after all its difficulties, theBank of New England still earned more than $25 million fromits derivatives trading activity in 1990.
