(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Cornell University commission reportedMonday that a graduate student acted alone and with ``recklessdisregard'' when he unleashed a computer ``worm'' that cloggedthousands of computers around the country.   But a university official said that raising ethical awareness,not security barriers, is the best way to stop such problems.   The commission concluded in its report that Robert T. Morris Jr.did not intend for the worm launched into the Internet network lastNov. 2 to destroy data or files, but that he did want it to spreadwidely.   The commission said the program was not technically a ``virus''_ a program that inserts itself into a host program to propagate _but was a ``worm,'' an independent program that replicates itselfonce placed in a computer system.   Contrary to Morris' claim, release of the worm was not a``heroic event that pointed up the weaknesses of operatingsystems,'' the commission wrote. The commission also denied thatMorris was a genius for creating the worm, saying although it wastechnically sophisticated, it could have been created by manystudents.   In fact, Morris' ``juvenile act'' did little in the way ofproviding new insights into the already well-known security flawsof the Internet system, a national research network used byuniversities, industry and the government, said M. Stuart Lynn,Cornell's vice president of technologies.   Lynn and Cornell Provost Robert Barker said the incident'sgreatest impact was the breach of trust it caused among researcherswho use the network. However, both cautioned that employing drasticsecurity steps was not a solution to prevent similar incidents fromhappening in the future.   ``Violations of such a trust cannot be condoned,'' said Lynn.``A community of scholars shouldn't have to build sky-high walls inorder to protect a reasonable expectation of privacy, particularlywhen such walls would impede the free flow of information andideas.''   Although security has been improved, Lynn said it's unlikely anysteps could guarantee an impenetrable system ``in a community ofindividuals possessed of all the knowledge and skills required toscale the highest barriers.''   Instead, the Cornell officials stressed the need for improvedawareness of computer ethics.   ``The focus of our report is on heightening the ethicalconsiderations, rather than the security considerations,'' saidLynn.   Cornell has an express policy about computer abuse, which Morrishad been given a copy of, said Barker.   Morris, who is on a leave of absence from the school's doctoralprogram in computer science, declined to be interviewed by thecommission.   The commission made no recommendation about disciplinary action.Barker said Morris' case would be reviewed by a panel of graduatestudents and faculty members, which could bar him permanently fromthe university. Barker said the punishment would not be made public.   Morris, 23, of Arnold, Md., remains under investigation by afederal grand jury in Syracuse and the U.S. Justice Department.</TEXT></DOC>
