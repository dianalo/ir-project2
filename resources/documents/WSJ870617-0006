The measure was watered down to meet the objections of Reagan administration officials and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker, who argued it would curb foreign investment in the U.S.    The legislation would give the president new authority to stop any foreign takeover that &quot;threatens essential commerce which affects national security.&quot; Currently, the president can stop acquisitions on antitrust grounds or by declaring a national emergency.    The panel's measure will be added to the sweeping trade package that is likely to be taken to the Senate floor next week; the trade bill passed by the House contains a similar provision. The measure is designed to cover such situations as Japan's Fujitsu Corp.'s failed attempt to take over Fairchild Corp.'s semiconductor unit earlier this year.    President Reagan told Republican senators yesterday that he would oppose any protectionist measures. He indicated that he particularly disliked the House version of the trade legislation, which contains provisions limiting presidential discretion in handling trade problems.    &quot;This legislation could prevent future presidents from throwing up their hands and proclaiming that they have no power to act while national security industries and technologies fall under foriegn control,&quot; said Sen. Jim Exon (D., Neb.).    In a compromise, Sen. Exon agreed that licensing agreements and joint ventures by foreign companies wouldn't be subject to the presidential authority to ban foreign acquisitions if national security is threatened. Initially, they would have been covered.    Under the legislation, the Commerce Department could initiate an investigation into the national security implications of a proposed foreign takeover, and the president could halt the transaction until an investigation is complete. After the probe, the president could prohibit the transaction. If the takeover has been completed, the president would be authorized to seek divestiture or forfeiture in court. </TEXT></DOC>
