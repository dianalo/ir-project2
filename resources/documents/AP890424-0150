Observers in Nicagagua</HEAD><BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Contra rebels and Nicaraguan oppositionparties asked the United Nations on Monday to send monitors toensure that the presidential campaign is democratic.   The leftist Sandinista government made its own request on March16 that the international body send poll-watchers for the election,set for Feb. 25, 1990.   The government agreed to the elections and other democraticreforms last February in a pact among five Central Americanpresidents. In exchange, the leaders said they would arrive at aplan by mid-May to disband the Contras.   Spokesmen for the rebels and the political opposition, whichranges from conservative to communist, said they made their requestMonday during a 2{-hour meeting with Alvaro de Soto, an aide toU.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.   Joining the Contra envoys were officials from the SocialDemocratic Party, Conservative Party, Conservative Party ofNicaragua, Conservative Democratic Party, Socialist Party, SocialChristian Party, the Private Enterprise Council, and the CommunistParty, which is separate from the Sandinistas.   Contra leader Aristedes Sanchez said the rebels, who are armedand living in camps in neighboring Honduras, and the oppositiongroups would honor the results of ``a free election.''   However, the two groups said they still had misgivings about theattitude of the leftist Sandinista government in Managua.   The rebels and political opposition have been suspicious aboutwhether the Sandinistas will allow the national election commissionand the country's news media to function impartially.   The Sandinista Party controls both the government and the mediain Nicaragua.   However, the rebels and political leaders on Monday expressedtheir commitment to participate in the election.   ``This is an opportunity to rebuild the nation,'' said BoscoMatamoros, another Contra leader.   The Contra and Nicaraguan political leaders did not discussspecific proposals after their meeting with de Soto.   But they said they want the United Nations to verify that thecampaign is free and fair. Matamoros stressed what he called ``thenecessity of international support, guarantees and verification.''   Perez de Cuellar has said his aides are reviewing whether tosend observers to Nicaragua. He has notified the General Assemblyto be ready to approve funds if the mission is approved.   About 12,000 Contra fighters are believed to be in Honduranborder camps. U.S. military aid to the Contras ended 11 months ago,and they now receive only humanitarian aid.   In April, the Contras declared a truce until the Februaryelections.</TEXT></DOC>
