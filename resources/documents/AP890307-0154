On Monday, NATO and the Warsaw Pact outlined proposals for newtalks opening Thursday on reducing conventional arms and forces fromthe Atlantic to the Ural mountains in the Soviet Union.   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization focused on drasticnumerical reductions in Soviet tanks and artillery. Soviet ForeignMinister Eduard A. Shevardnadze proposed deep cuts in troops and allkinds of weaponry, including combat aircraft and battlefield nuclearrockets.   Shevardnadze also proposed new talks on the tactical nuclearweapons, which have a 300-mile range, preceded by moves to withdrawthem from large parts of West Germany, East Germany andCzechoslovakia.   Western officials said his proposals seemed aimed at WestGermany, where there is increasing reluctance to go along withAmerican demands for immediate modernization of aging U.S.battlefield nuclear rockets.   West Germany's foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, did notmention Shevardnadze's proposal in his speech Tuesday to a 35-nationforeign ministers' conference that precedes the formal opening ofthe new talks Thursday.   Genscher also failed to mention the need to keep a nucleardeterrence in the NATO arsenal, ranged against what the West saysare far larger Warsaw Pact land forces in Europe.   By contrast, French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas termed nuclearweapons an ``irreplaceable'' deterrent.   ``The maintenance of credible defenses, the modernization of thisor that weapon is necessary,'' Dumas said Tuesday.   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe also said a nucleardeterrent is needed when he laid out NATO's proposals on Monday.   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III held his first talksTuesday with Shevardnadze, agreeing to go to Moscow in early May tofix a possible summit and resumption of talks to reduce long-rangenuclear missiles.   Both men said later their meeting took place in a good atmosphere.   But Baker took issue with Shevardnadze's proposals for talks toeliminate battlefield nuclear missiles, noting that these werespecifically excluded from the mandate for the new talks.   A U.S. official suggested on Monday that Shevardnadze's proposalwas meant to see if Moscow could open up fissures in the alliance.   The United States made its own appeal to West German opinionMonday by announcing it will explore ways for speeding thewithdrawal of chemical weapons due out by 1992.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, who has irritated theAmericans by asking for a two-year delay on modernizing short-rangenuclear missiles, hailed the move and on Tuesday urged the SovietUnion to destroy its chemical arms in East Europe.   Genscher lined up behind the alliance proposals for the newtalks, but signaled he feels East and West should cooperate ondisarmament.   He said West Germany and Poland will act as joint hosts in Juneto a conference of military experts from NATO, the Warsaw Pact andneutral European nations to work on criteria for turning themilitary might massed in Europe into purely defensive forces.   After meeting Baker, Shevardnadze noted the differences betweenhis proposals and NATO's, but added:   ``Negotiation is negotiation. It is a complex process and Ibelieve that in this process we will be able to find mutuallyacceptable decisions.''   West European newspaper commentators welcomed the new efforts tostart dismantling military forces on the world's most heavily armedcontinent.   The liberal British newspaper, the Guardian, suggested, however,that NATO was upstaged by the Soviets and questioned whetheralliance nations had yet ``begun to leave behind the Cold Waratmosphere.''   ``If the dynamism of the Soviet side is not recognized and _critically but positively _ matched by the West, that is a truefailure of imagination,'' it said.   The Belgian newspaper, La Libre Belgique, said it sees littlecommon ground between NATO and Warsaw Pact positions and wonderedwhether the talks will fail as earlier negotiations to reduce tanksand troops in central Europe did.   But other commentators and Western officials expressed optimismbecause of new Soviet willingness to disarm.</TEXT></DOC>
