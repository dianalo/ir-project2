The Denver-based building products company said its firstquarter profit was $35.7 million, or $1.23 per share, down from$42.8 million, or $1.52 per share, in the first quarter of 1987.   First quarter 1987 results included $9 million in gains from thesale of two real estate ventures.   Sales in the quarter ended March 31 rose to $502.1 million from$475 million in the same period a year ago, the company said.   ``Despite severe competition in most construction segments,Manville's overall performance continues to be strong,'' said TomStephens, Manville's president and chief executive officer.   He attributed Manville's first quarter results to theperformance of the forest products division and the effects ofstronger international currencies.   ``Excluding the non-recurring gain on the sale of our realestate holdings, 1988's operating performance was higher than therecord first quarter of 1987,'' Stephens said.   Manville filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of thefederal bankruptcy act on Aug. 26, 1982, because it was faced withbillions of dollars worth of lawsuits claiming damage from exposureto asbestos made by Manville.   The federal bankruptcy court approved the company'sreorganization plan in December 1986, but the plan cannot beimplemented until all appeals by claimants are addressed.</TEXT></DOC>
