The company has been unwillingto meet very many times this year. We aren't against it, we are justsurprised by it,'' said Cindy Yeast, spokeswoman for the flightattendants union.   Chicago-based United requested the mediation in an applicationfiled with the National Mediation Board on Tuesday.   ``A mediator has to be selected and dates for new talks agreedupon. All this takes time,'' said Ms. Yeast.   United refused comment on the matter.   ``We never have any comment concerning contract negotiations,''said United spokeswoman Sara Dornacker.   United's 13,000 flight attendants rejected a tentative agreementalmost a year ago. New negotiations began in January and employeescontinued to work under their old labor pact.   ``There is no threat of a strike. Airlines are governed by theRailway Labor Act, which stipulates a number of cooling off periodsand contract extensions,'' Ms. Yeast said.   Since April, the carrier also has been involved in contract talkswith the Air Line Pilots Association.</TEXT></DOC>
