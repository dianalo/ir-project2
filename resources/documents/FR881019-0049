In accordance with section517(c) of the 1987 Act, the rule would eliminate the former three-pronged``special priority'' test for the selection of homesteaders and substitutea single priority selection criterion_that the prospective homesteaderbe a ``lower-income'' person or family. The rule also would implement section517(d) of the 1987 Act, which authorizes States and units of general localgovernment participating in the program to designate a ``qualified non-profitorganization'', or a public agency, to act as the local urban homesteadingagency responsible for selecting homesteaders and properties, and for acceptingtitle to and conveying the properties to homesteaders. Finally, the rulealso would make a number of specific changes in program procedures, suchas specifying certain additional documents that must be submitted witha locality's urban homesteading application, setting a guideline that alocal urban homesteading agency should generally anticipate homesteadinga minimum of five properties per year in order to participate effectivelyin the program, and raising the existing limit on the values of propertiesselected for homesteading from $20,000 to $25,000 for one-unit properties,and from $5,000 to $8,000 per additional unit in two- to four-unit properties.In addition, the program's fund reservation system is being changed froman annual reservation based on estimated annual needs to a system of first-come,first-served reservations for specific properties.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2><T3>Comments Due: </T3>December 19, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Interested persons are invited to submit comments regardingthis rule to the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Room 10276,Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 7th Street, SW., Washington,DC 20410.

However, the Department is not currentlyplanning to implement either of these demonstrations in FY 1989.Also, section 517(b) amends section 106(d)(3)(A) of the 1974 Act to allowState participants in the Urban Homesteading Program to use Community DevelopmentBlock Grant (CDBG) funds for urban homesteading administrative expenses,consistent with the authority available to CDBG grantees other than States.This provision will be implemented by an appropriate revision to the StateCDBG Regulations, rather than in this rule. However, this provision isself-executing, and, therefore, it does not require regulatory action tobe effective. States participating in the Urban Homesteading Program maycharge eligible administrative expenses incurred after February 5, 1988(the effective date of the 1987 Act) in operating their urban homesteadingprograms to their otherwise available State CDBG administrative funds,provided such administrative expenditures would satisfy other Title I requirements.Other changes to Part 590 in this rule are proposed at HUD's initiative.Generally, these changes stem from the need to update certain provisionsin keeping with comments received from Congressional committee reports,comments from local officials, and HUD's own experience in administeringthe program since the last revision of the regulations (see 50 FR 25941,June 24, 1985).The principal proposed amendments to Part 590 are discussed below in theorder that they appear in the proposed rule. Other technical amendmentsare proposed in the following sections of Part 590: andSection; 590.1(a)and (b); andSection; 590.5 (definitions of ``Act'' and ``LUHA'' are amended;new definitions of ``lower-income families'' and ``qualified communityorganization'' are added; and definition of ``locally owned property''is deleted); andSection; 590.7; andSection; 590.11(c) and (d); andSection; 590.13;andSection; 590.15; andSection; 590.17(a) and (b)(3); andSection; 590.19; andSection;590.23; andSection; 590.29; and 590.31. These technical amendments have notbeen separately discussed below, since they are either editorial in nature,or they are conforming changes to make the amended provision consistentwith one of the principal amendments in the proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Amendments to Part 590</ITAG>In andSection; 590.7, ``Program requirements,'' and andSection; 590.13(b),``Standards for HUD review and approval of a local urban homesteading program,''the proposed rule would add guidance that, in general, local agencies shallselect neighborhoods so as to be able to anticipate homesteading a minimumof five properties per year, in order for their programs to be cost-effectiveand have discernible neighborhood impact. These provisions are proposedin view of the high demand for scarce program funds in order to establisha reasonable threshold level necessary for continued program participation.Regional economic conditions dictate not only the availability of federally-ownedproperties but also their price range. These factors, in turn, influencethe feasibility of homesteading in the region. Over time, economic conditionsshift within regions of the country, so that homesteading may become infeasiblein a previously active area due to a lack of foreclosed single-family propertiesin the HUD, VA, and FmHA inventories, or the increased cost of such properties.Conversely, as more properties become available or their values decrease,homesteading may become very active in an area previously inactive. Withouta threshold program level, communities could continue indefinitely in theprogram, operating ineffective, expensive, low level programs, while otherareas with greater need for program resources find it difficult or impossibleto obtain funding.Under ``Program requirements'' at andSection; 590.7(b)(2), the homesteaderselection section would be modified to conform the regulations to section517(c) of the 1987 Act. The three existing priority selection criteriawould be deleted and one priority criterion set forth, which would givepriority to eligible ``lower-income families or individuals,'' as definedby 24 CFR Part 813. Since HUD has already advised local urban homesteadingagencies that this provision is considered self-executing, local agenciesshould already be selecting homesteaders in accordance with the new singlecriterion for priority. However, homesteaders notified of their selectionin accordance with the previous special priority criteria before February5, 1988 (the effective date of the 1987 Act) remain entitled to properties,if they have not received them yet. The proposed rule would make no changein the effect of the statutory priority from existing rules, apart fromthe simplification of the criterion for priority selection itself. Specifically,a local urban homesteading agency (LUHA) still may not select a homesteaderwho is not entitled to priority if there is an available priority homesteadingcandidate who has applied and is qualified for the particular propertyinvolved. LUHAs should document their homesteader selection files to showthat they are complying with this priority. In addition, LUHAs are requiredto ensure that homesteaders are matched to the bedroom size of the propertyso that homesteaders are not under- or over-housed.Section 590.7(b)(2) would also be amended to describe the extent to whichcertain homesteader selection criteria based on residency may be imposedby participating LUHAs if they so choose. However, this description shouldnot be construed to authorize participating LUHAs to use such criteriain a manner which would override the statutory priority for lower-incomepersons. That is, if there is a lower-income applicant otherwise qualifiedto participate in the program, who does not meet the locally imposed residencyor other criteria, then that applicant would still take precedence overany non-lower income candidate meeting such local criteria.Finally, a new provision, designated (iii), has been added to assure thatmembership in, or ties to, particular private organizations are not madea factor affecting homesteader selection. With the advent of non-profitcommunity organizations as LUHAs, HUD believes it is important to specifythat membership in any private organization doing business with such anorganization, and any other ties to a particular private organization,are not made criteria for homesteader selection.Also under ``Program requirements'' in andSection; 590.7, amendments to subparagraphs(b)(4) and (b)(6) are proposed in order to clarify the LUHA's responsibilityto assist in securing compliance with section 312 loan terms and to finda replacement homesteader where it appears that the initial applicant hasdefaulted on a section 312 loan during the homesteader's conditional titleperiod. During this period, foreclosure of the section 312 loan is generallynot a viable option, since it either results in undue loss to HUD, if HUDforecloses only on the homesteader's interest in the property, or it resultsin the property being lost to the homesteading program, if the LUHA givesup its reverter interest in the property and allows HUD to foreclose andthen to sell the property on the open market. The best option both to minimizeHUD's loss and to preserve the property for homesteading is for the localagency to identify a successor homesteader who will assume the section312 loan, or as much of the loan as the property's value at the time ofassumption will support. The proposed amendments are designed to give localagencies clearer regulatory notice of this policy, which is more fullydescribed in a notice on this subject issued under HUD's Unified IssuancesSystem. Also, the amendments to andSection; 590.7(b)(6) would allow HUD toshorten the homesteading period required of the successor homesteader underthat section, if that is necessary to attract a successor homesteader.Under ``Program requirements'' in andSection; 590.7, a new paragraph (c)would be added entitled ``Designation of LUHA.'' As at present, the applicantState or unit of general local government may act as its own local urbanhomesteading agency (LUHA), conducting the program, and accepting and conveyingtitle to federally owned properties in its own name, or it may designatea legally separate and independent public agency to do so. Similar to presentpractice, the designation is approved by HUD as part of the program applicationapproval process, and it remains in effect until a new LUHA is designatedby the applicant by a program amendment approved by HUD, or the local urbanhomesteading program is closed out. Finally, also as presently permitted(although not specified in the current regulation), the proposed rule specifiesthat the LUHA may carry out its program functions through a third partycontractor, consultant, or agent, except for the acceptance and conveyanceof title to properties. The proposed regulation makes clear that the thirdparty agreement must be in writing, and it may not relieve the LUHA orthe applicant of responsibility for the conduct of the program.However, based on section 517(d) of the 1987 Act, HUD also proposes toallow qualified community organizations to act as LUHAs. As provided bythe 1987 Act, qualified community organizations are nonprofit corporationswhose directors serve without pay and which qualify as IRS section 501(c)(3)tax exempt organizations. Consistent with present practice, any designatedLUHA (whether public or private) must have legal authority to accept andconvey title to properties for homesteading purposes. The proposed regulationspecifically provides that this key function may not be passed on to anotherentity by the LUHA, unless HUD approves a program amendment designatinga new LUHA. This is necessary because up to three Federal agencies mustknow on a day-to-day basis what local entity they are authorized to dealwith in conveying properties, and to assure that the LUHA remains properlyaccountable for the properties it obtains, both to HUD and to the homesteaderswho deal with the LUHA.Finally, the proposed regulation would require a written agreement betweenthe LUHA and the applicant, and it would specify certain provisions whichthe agreement must, at a minimum, contain. HUD believes that a writtenagreement detailing the responsibility of the LUHA is essential for non-profitsto act as LUHAs. HUD also believes that program responsibilities will beclarified and accountability strengthened if designated public agenciesare also required to enter into such agreements with the responsible Statesand units of general local government.Under ``Applications'' at andSection; 590.11, the proposed rule would requirelocal urban homesteading agencies applying for the first time to submitadditional information in their application package. HUD is now requestinga description of the applicant's proposed homesteader selection procedureswhich complies with the 1987 Act and andSection; 590.7(b)(2) of the regulations,copies of the applicant's proposed legal documents complying with andSection;590.7(b)(3), (5) and (7), an estimate of the number of properties to beacquired during the program year, and a copy of the applicant's writtenagreement designating any local urban homesteading agency in compliancewith andSection; 590.7(c). Receipt of these specific documents is necessaryto avoid serious flaws in program design which HUD has found more difficultto correct after the fact. The Department still wishes to offer maximumlatitude to local agencies administering the program, but several recentapplicants have commented that they prefer more detailed information onthese matters at program start up. Similarly, in andSection; 590.11(b) HUDis requiring previously approved applicants to submit this new informationfor the first program year following the effective date of the final rulecontaining this provision.Under ``Transfer of HUD-owned property'' at andSection; 590.17(b)(4) andunder ``Reimbursement to FmHA and VA'' at andSection; 590.18(c)(1), the administrativelyimposed maximum amount that may be charged to section 810 appropriationsfor acquisition of federally-owned single-dwelling unit properties wouldbe raised from $20,000 to $25,000, in keeping with suggestions from theHouse-Senate Conference Committee on H.J. Res. 395 (FY 1988 AppropriationsAct) in House of Representatives Report No. 100-498 at page 843. This willhelp keep pace with inflation in real estate market values being experiencedin some areas of the country. This cost cap has not been adjusted since1985. HUD does, however, propose to amend andSection; 590.17 and andSection;590.18 to delete field office authority to grant ``local program-wide''exceptions to this acquisition cost cap, because of the need of furthertarget the limited program funds to sections of the nation experiencingsofter real estate markets. Under the proposed rule, the price paid fora property would be the as-is fair market value, not to exceed $25,000,or a negotiated lesser amount, unless an exception for an individual propertyis granted by a HUD Field Office. An additional amount up to $8,000 perunit may also be charged to section 810 funds for properties with two tofour dwelling units. This is an increase from $5,000 per additional dwellingunit, a figure which had not been adjusted since the inception of the program.In addition, the 30 day time frame for which HUD/FHA has been obligatedto suspend its routine property disposition activity in urban homesteadingneighborhoods is shortened to 21 days to reflect actual program experienceand realize economies for the Department.At andSection; 590.21, ``Reservation and reduction of funds,'' the proposedrule would provide for reduction of funds when there are no affordable,federally-owned properties available due to a change in market conditionsfor the area and establishes a ``first come, first served`` policy forfund reservations. That is, funds would not be reserved for a LUHA onlywhen actual properties have been identified for acquisition. This is necessaryso that scarce resources will not be set aside for a LUHA whose housingmarket may have improved considerably, thereby reducing the inventory ofavailable, affordable properties, since submission of the Annual Requestfor Participation. Also, this policy change will minimize the need forfund re-allocations at the end of each fiscal year. Similarly, at andSection;590.23, ``Program close-out,'' the proposed rule gives HUD specific authorityto terminate a homesteading program if such market conditions have existedfor two fiscal years and are likely to persist for the next fiscal year.Section 590.23(c) is also revised to make the LUHA's obligation to continueto monitor, enforce, and implement existing agreements with homesteadersafter close-out.Finally, at andSection; 590.31(e), the proposed rule would clarify the remedialstandard under which HUD may direct the LUHA to repay HUD for homesteadproperties that the LUHA has mishandled. The former standard on its facedealt only with properties that the LUHA had ``converted to its own use.''This standard clearly covered properties that the LUHA had sold, rented,or used for its own purposes without HUD approval; it did not as clearlycover situations in which the LUHA's negligent failure to preserve andprotect the property permitted deterioration that made it infeasible tohomestead the property. The revised language of the proposed rule wouldcorrect this oversight.<ITAG tagnum="84">Findings and Certifications</ITAG>The collection of information requirements contained in this rule havebeen submitted to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980.
