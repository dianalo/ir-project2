The official Tass news agency said authorities imposed a 9 p.m.to 6 a.m. curfew and banned all rallies in Novy Uzen, in theKazakhstan republic, but ``clashes between warring groups ofhoodlums are continuing in the town.''   Hundreds of soldiers were sent to Novy Uzen over the weekend toquell the fighting in the city that is an isolated gas and oilrefining center in the harsh Caspian desert.   Interior Ministry spokesman Boris Mikhailov said the riotingbegan Friday night in Novy Uzen and was aimed at minoritiesoriginally from the Caucasus Mountain region on the other side ofthe Caspian Sea.   It was the third outbreak of violence in the past six weeks inSoviet Central Asia. The region has been buffeted by a soaringpopulation, pollution, a shortage of jobs and rising ethnic tensions.   About 100 people were killed earlier this month during 10 days ofarson and attacks directed against the Meskhi Turk minority inneighboring Uzbekistan where Uzbeks form the majority.   In Turkmenia, a republic south of Kazakhstan, mobs rampagedthrough the streets in early May demanding that cooperatives beclosed and Armenian traders be forced to leave the area.   Official reports said most of the violence in Novy Uzen wasagainst Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Lezgins who make up about 20,000of the city's population of 56,000 people, with Kazakhs in themajority.   Mikhailov said about 7,000 people gathered Monday in the city'smain square demanding that cooperative businesses be closed andpeople from the Caucasus republics be sent home.   ``Two battalions of Interior (Ministry) soldiers were brought into stop the unrest,'' he said. ``The crowd was dispersed, but itbroke into several large groups of youths armed with pipes andstones and other objects. They went along the streets, organizingbrawls, pogroms and arson.''   Mikhailov said three people were killed and 53 injured accordingto preliminary reports and there were 57 arrests. Tass said said twoKazakhs and one Lezgin were killed.   Official reports said the trouble began with a fight betweenethnic groups at a dance. Hundreds of young people roamed thestreets breaking windows and setting fire to cars and buildings.   Tass reported 59 shops were damaged, five cars burned and manywindows broken.   It said soldiers fired in the air and used cheremukha, a chemicalsubstance similar to tear gas, to break up the mobs. The militaryhas said cheremukha was used when troops crushed a pro-independenceprotest in Tbilisi, Georgia, on April 9. Twenty people were killedin the violence.   More than 700 people, mostly women and children, were evacuatedfrom Novy Uzen to a heavily guarded bus station 8{ miles from thecity, Mikhailov said.   The government newspaper Izvestia reported many returned homeafter the situation quieted down.   It said the native Kazakhs ``complained to the leadership aboutbad social conditions of life in the city and high prices foressential goods.''   They demanded that people from the Caucasus region be forced tomove and that gas and oil production plants stop bringing in workersfor work shifts of a week or longer, according to Izvesti. It saidthe protesters claimed the imported workers live better than thelocal population.   The protesters were particularly angry at cooperatives owned bythe Caucasus minorities, Mikhailov said. Cooperatives are small,privately owned businesses that have been permitted under PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms as an alternative to the state-runeconomy.   Many Soviets suspect cooperative owners of profiteering andserving as fronts for organized crime.</TEXT></DOC>
