Eastern took out ads in newspapers in 10 cities Sunday seekingmechanics to replace Machinists union members who have been onstrike since March 4.   The Miami-based carrier was almost grounded when pilots honoredpicket lines, and the airline filed for bankruptcy protection fourdays into the strike.   The airline started hiring new pilots in the strike's firstmonth and had added 264 as of Friday. Two pilots have alreadycompleted training; the rest are still being trained. The airlinealso has begin hiring and trining new flight attendants.   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said wages offered new mechanicswill range from $10 to $18 an hour. That is about what the companywas paying the Machinists when the union struck, refusing wage cutsof more than a third for some members.   The newspaper ads say: ``Understand that given the currentstrike ... your assignment at Eastern may require you to performservices or replace employees involved in a labor dispute. But alsounderstand that this is an unprecedented opportunity for growth andsuccess.''   Matell said the company expects many inquiries from experiencedmechanics.   Lewis said it's unlikely Eastern will be able to hire qualifiedmechanics because other major carriers who are hiring mechanicsoffer more stability and better wages.   ``They would get people who have been rejected by the othercarriers,'' he said.   Lewis said handfuls of strikers ``have dribbled across'' thepicket lines with the strike in its third month. He said he didn'texpect large numbers to go back because of Eastern's new offer.   He added that it takes up to two years to fully train a mechanicto work on jetliners. Eastern officials said they couldn't estimatehow long it will take to train their new mechanics without knowingtheir experience.   The company plans to hire 500 non-union mechanics in the nextfew months.   ``We've said we have to rebuild the airline and the unionsflat-out have said they will not come back for currentmanagement,'' Matell said. ``I don't think it should come as asurprise.''   Under its rebuilding plan, Eastern wants 2,500 mechanics. Thecompany had more than that when the Machinists union, which alsorepresents ramp agents, janitors and other ground workers, walkedout.   Eastern must have bankruptcy court approval of its plan. Thecourt set a Wednesday deadline for offers from interested buyers.</TEXT></DOC>
