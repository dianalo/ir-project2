Basically, what they're saying is you can fish there if youcan withstand the grief,'' lobsterman Jim Nadeau said Wednesdaynight after the Coast Guard announced lobster boats would beboarded and searched for bombs and terrorists before they can comewithin 500 yards of Bush's home.   ``If I don't fish in there, that one particular area willprobably cost me $500 or $600 or $700 a week,'' said Nadeau, whowill keep working around the Bush home at Walker's Point.   Bush has said in the past he does not want to disrupt thelobstering done around his home by about three dozen fishermen. Butlobstermen said the Bush entourage has caused problems since he wasvice president.   Lobstermen complain that Coast Guard cutters on security patrolshave slashed the buoy lines on their lobster pots, costing themhundreds of dollars as the traps and lobsters are lost.   Coast Guard Capt. R.W. ``Bud'' Breault Jr. acknowledged thatmore lobster traps will be destroyed with the new security zone,and it may be difficult for the lobstermen to prove who did it ifthey try to file a claim.   ``This will have an impact on you and probably your lobsterpots,'' Breault told the angry lobstermen in a special meeting.   Some lobstermen said they will refuse to work the waters offBush's property because they don't want government officialsboarding their boats.   ``None of us wants to be boarded on a regular basis,'' saidlobsterman Knoep Nieuwkerk, who plans to stay away. ``Nobody wantsto be boarded. Do you want police checking your car every day?''   Coast Guard boats have cut lobster pot buoy lines because theyare not equipped with ``cages'' that prevent propellers fromslashing the lines, the lobstermen said. The Coast Guard saidWednesday night it will install nozzles that wrap around thepropellers on some of its smaller boats, but not on the largecutters that will roam the safety zone and a larger area extendinganother 500 to 1,000 yards farther out to sea.</TEXT></DOC>
