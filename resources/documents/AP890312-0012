Armored police vans with multiple tear gas launchers firedvolleys of choking gas into the crowds around Yonsei University ineastern Seoul.   ``Oust Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Thrust a knife into the Roh regime!''protesters shouted as they charged police and pelted them with rocksand firebombs that spewed blazing gasoline.   About 2,000 troopers hurled rocks back as dense clouds of whitetear gas cloaked the campus.   Police said some officers were injured, but they had no figures.They did not report any arrests.   The violence erupted when protesters tried to march out of Yonseiafter about 10,000 workers, dissidents and students held a campusrally to denounce the Roh government and demand free labor unions.South Korean law restricts some trade union activity.   In speeches, dissident leaders bitterly attacked the Rohgovernment and big corporations that dominate the South Koreaneconomy. Speakers said the government and corporations weresubjecting people to lives of endless work and poverty.   ``Rise up and march forth to let out our anger at thesuppressors,'' dissident leader Paik Ki-wan said as thousandscheered and clapped.   Thousands of protesters then marched to the school's main gate,beating drums and jabbing their fists into the air.   Protesters burned an effigy of Chung Ju-yong, founder of HyundaiCorp., the nation's biggest company. Police broke up a protest atthe company's Seoul headquarters last week.   Some students armed with clubs and firebombs then surged out ofseveral gates and climbed over the school's walls to attack riotpolice blocking the way. Most protesters stayed on the campus anddid not attack police.   The clash, one of the biggest anti-government protests in SouthKorea in recent months, was confined to the main road in front ofthe school and lasted about one hour.   Riot police guarded government buildings and the Hyundaiheadquarters in central Seoul to prevent attacks. There were noreports of any incidents.   Dissidents and radical students claim Roh is a front for militaryrule and seek the overthrow of his government. Dissident leaders saythey want to end the domination of the government bureaucracy, themilitary and big industrial corporations.   Roh, a former general who took office in February 1988, hasintroduced broad democratic reforms. But many South Koreans opposehis government because of its ties to past authoritarian regimes.   The dissidents have little public support, but they have beenshowing new strength following the formation in January of a newanti-government alliance. The anti-government students back thealliance.</TEXT></DOC>
