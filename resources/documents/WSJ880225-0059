Someone in Congress ought to conduct an on-site inspection.    We hear that Air Force Intelligence has officially concluded the Soviets have rolled production lines to break out of the ABM treaty and deploy a nationwide anti-missile system, which possibly could be in place by next year. That Maj. Gen. Schuyler Bissell, head of Air Force Intelligence, briefed the CIA on this conclusion late last week. And that the finding is based on two new pieces of evidence:   First, the Soviets are &quot;internetting&quot; their early-warning radars with interceptor-guidance radars. They have conducted &quot;hand-off exercises&quot; in which the large phased-array radars like the controversial one at Krasnoyarsk pick up targets and alert the Flat Twin and Pawn Shop mobile radars that guide their SH-04 and SH-08 anti-missile interceptors. This is the key &quot;battle management&quot; function of an anti-missile system.    Second, the Soviets are mass producing the Flat Twin and Pawn Shop radars, though the ABM treaty limits them to two locations. Similarly, they are mass producing the SH-08, a relatively new supersonic missile that intercepts warheads within the atmosphere, with 500 such missiles already produced and 3,000 ultimately projected. The ABM treaty limits each side to only 100 interceptors of all types, and the Soviets also have the SH-04, which intercepts above the atmosphere, as well as other interceptors with both anti-aircraft and antimissile capability.    While rich in detail, our reports admittedly have not been from direct participants in these briefings. We now find that the New York Tribune, the Unification Church paper in New York, published substantially the same reports on Monday, quoting &quot;a senior military intelligence official.&quot;    An official conclusion that the Soviets are breaking out of the ABM treaty, to be sure, only would put an official stamp on what has been apparent all along. The Soviets have taken full advantage of treaty provisions allowing large radars at one ABM site, at missile test ranges and on the periphery of the nation. To finish the job, they simply ignored these restrictions to build at Krasnoyarsk.    The administration has cited the Krasnoyarsk radar as an outright violation, and both houses of Congress have voted their agreement. The administration also has protested the deployment of Flat Twin and Pawn Shop radars at Gomel, beyond the sites permitted at the Sary Shagan and Kamchatka test ranges. In his compliance report to Congress in December, President Reagan said: &quot;The absence of Soviet dismantlement of the Krasnoyarsk radar, the new violation in the deployment of the Flat Twin and Pawn Shop observed at Gomel, and the totality of Soviet ABM-related activities in 1987 and previous years, suggest that the USSR may be preparing an ABM defense of its national territory.&quot;    These are the words, of course, of the same administration that currently has a new INF treaty before the Senate, and has just had its Secretary of State in Moscow pushing a new strategic arms treaty in time for the impending Moscow summit. A breakout finding would be of monumental importance to these enterprises.    On arms control in general, the prospect of a Soviet ABM breakout raises once again the question of why we are negotiating new treaties with them when they are breaking the old ones. On the proposed 50% reduction in offensive arms in particular, the Soviet ABM technology is not Star Wars. It is ground-based, and many analysts think each interceptor carries a nuclear warhead so that highly accurate guidance is not needed. But with our offensive weapons limited by treaty and with no defense of our own against a Soviet first strike, our deterrent could be significantly degraded even by this 1970s technology.    Perhaps our reports, or for that matter the Air Force itself, may be overly alarmist. But Senators about to vote on another arms treaty should be warned to inquire for themselves. Certainly anyone as preoccupied with the exegesis of treaties as Senator Sam Nunn would want to know chapter and verse of the current Air Force assessment. </TEXT></DOC>
