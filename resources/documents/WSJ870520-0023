The amount marked a significant increase from February, when withdrawals exceeded new deposits by $1.1 billion. Withdrawals from accounts smaller than $100,000, called retail accounts, exceeded deposits by $4.5 billion in March, compared with $671 million the month before. Bank Board officials hadn't any explanation for the sharp rise, although one suggested that the strong stock market in March could have attracted money from thrift accounts.    Withdrawals from federally insured thrifts have exceeded new deposits for seven straight months, while congressional debate continues on a plan to recapitalize the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. But total deposits held by the institutions in March were higher than in the same month in 1986. Federally insured thrifts held a total of $893 billion in deposits in March, compared with $862 billion the year before.    Federally insured thrifts closed $21.7 billion in mortgages in March, up from February's level of $16.1 billion and 27.4% higher than in March 1986. Thrifts issued $23.1 billion in new mortgage commitments in March, up from February's level of $17.2 billion and 25.2% higher than the year before. March's increases in both closings and new commitments were larger than the normal increases that reflect seasonal patterns, and follow recent patterns of higher housing starts, mostly reflecting lower interest rates.    About 6.2% of thrifts' mortgage loans were delinquent in March, down slightly from 6.3% in February. </TEXT></DOC>
