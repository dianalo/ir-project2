Don't bother with theforecasters or the professional projectors. If you want a glimpse of what theCalifornia population will look like in the year 2000, check out the annualcounty reports on the ethnic and racial backgrounds of public schoolstudents.;    For Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, the reports show thatthe number of Hispanic students in public schools is increasing steadily --even in those suburban districts once populated exclusively by non-Hispanicwhite families.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Peninsula Extra  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HISPANICS INCREASING IN SCHOOLS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  School Scene  </MEMO><TEXT>     This is not news to educators, but it may come as a surprise to somepoliticians and their constituents -- especially those already grumbling aboutthe high cost of public education. Given those attitudes, will Californiaschools be prepared for teaching students who come from families who are lessaffluent, less educated and less fluent in English than ever before?;   Already, one disparity is obvious. The vast majority -- in some cases morethan 80 percent -- of California school teachers, classroom aides andadministrators are white, even while the percentage of white students inpublic schools is steadily dropping.;    Leaving aside the thorny issue ofethnic and racial parity in the classroom, a more practical question remains:Will there be enough educators capable of communicating withnon-English-speaking students?;    The shortage of bilingual teachers isalready desperate. Some districts in San Mateo County have been forced to goto Spain to hire teachers and teachers' aides because not enough bilingualeducators are coming out of American schools. What about 10 years from now?;   In San Mateo County, for instance, the figures for the 1990-91 school yearshow a continuation of the trend of the past few years of annual sharpincreases in the number of Hispanic -- mostly Mexican or Mexican-American butalso including many Central Americans -- students, especially in Redwood Cityand East Palo Alto schools.;    Overall in San Mateo County, 25 percent of thecounty's student population is Hispanic, up from 23 percent last year. Thepercentages of Filipino, Pacific Islander and American Indian or AlaskanNative students also are up slightly, though these groups together make upless than 10 percent of the total population. The percentage of Asian andblack students remained more or less stable, but the overall percentage ofwhite students dropped nearly 2 percent.;    The figures are even moredramatic in other districts. The Ravenswood School District in East Palo Altoonce had a largely black student population, but now the number of Hispanicstudents is 46 percent -- up from 40 percent last year -- while the percentageof black students is dropping -- down to 43 percent this year compared to 49percent last year.;    In the Redwood City School District, 49 percent of thestudents are Hispanic, up from 47 percent last year, while the percentage ofwhite students dropped from 42 percent to 41 percent.;    But the picture ischanging even for the districts with high percentages of white students.Portola Valley's went from 91 percent white students to 89 percent; Woodsidewent from 89 percent to 88 percent; Las Lomitas in Menlo Park went from 88percent to 85 percent; and Menlo Park went from 82 percent to 79 percent. Atthe same time, each of these districts experienced increases in the number ofHispanic, black and Asian students.;    The same trends are discernible aswell in Peninsula schools in Santa Clara County. The changes are especiallyevident in Mountain View Elementary and Whisman Elementary, where the numberof Hispanic students has increased sharply. But even Los Altos Elementary andPalo Alto Unified are becoming more diverse.;    Compared to other unifieddistricts or districts of similar size -- 7,500 students for Palo Alto and2,900 for Los Altos -- both districts traditionally have been largely whiteschool districts, in part due to the high cost of housing in the cities. Someethnic and racial diversity has been achieved, however, through varioustransfer programs and the large numbers of foreign students with schoolchildren at Stanford University.;    But the latest figures show that thepercentage of white students is dropping in both districts. For instance, thepercentage in Los Altos dropped from 81 percent to 78 percent, while thepercentage of Hispanic students nearly doubled -- to 4 percent.;    PaloAlto's white student population went from 77 percent to 75 percent in oneyear, but most -- 88 percent -- of the teachers, classroom aides andadministrators are white, according to a recent district report.; (hbox);   RECYCLING: The latest thing in the adopt-a-school movement is hooking upbusinesses and schools through recycling projects. The Mid-PeninsulaEnvironmental Education Alliance (a long name for a group of non-profitorganizations trying to promote environmental awareness) is working with theSanta Clara County Manufacturing Group to encourage businesses to nurtureon-site recycling projects in local schools. The idea is to help bring kidsand educators closer to the business world, improve the environmental image ofcorporations, and reduce the solid waste stream while increasing recycling.The first school-business partnership has been set up between Kennedy MiddleSchool in Redwood City and Kaiser Permanente, and others are in the worksbetween Graham Middle School in Mountain View and Raytheon Co., and RavenswoodMiddle School in East Palo Alto and Stanford Graduate School of Business.;(hbox);    SCHOOL BOARD: The San Mateo County Board of Education appointedLouise B. Ebeling-Geraci to fill a vacancy on the county Board of Education.She will represent the area comprising the Belmont, Redwood City and SanCarlos school districts, and will serve until November 1992, unless there is apetition filed calling for a special election. Ebeling-Geraci, a formerteacher at Sequoia Union High and former principal in the San Mateo HighSchool District, was selected from a field of four candidates on Feb. 7. Herappointment was something of a disappointment to Hispanic residents of EastPalo Alto, who had packed the meeting to urge appointment of an Hispanic tothe board.; (hbox);    CALENDAR: The second installment of the third annualPalo Alto Committee for Better Schools forum will be Thursday at 7:30 p.m. atdistrict headquarters.
