The Senate still needs to nail down answers to questions aboutwhether the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty bansfuturistic weapons as well as existing missiles, Senate MajorityLeader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said Friday.   Assurances by the White House and a top Soviet official thatboth superpowers agree the treaty does ban future types of weaponsaren't enough, said Byrd and Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of theSenate Armed Services Committee.   ``We need to make sure, be absolutely clear,'' said Nunn,speaking of the issue of how the pact affects weapons such aslasers or particle beam weapons.   Byrd told his colleagues: ``I did not set the date of thesummit, I had nothing to do with it. This Senate is no president'srubber stamp and this senator is no president's man.''   Reagan had said Thursday that he hopes the pact is approved intime for him to take a ratification notice to Moscow for his May29-June 2 meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Reagan, asked whether failure to ratify the pact would affectthe summit, said, ``I think it would be very upsetting and it wouldput a strain on the summit.''   When the Senate finally does vote, ratification is likely, saidByrd. Ratification requires 67 votes, and Byrd and Republicanleaders have said they believe 90 of the 100 senators will supportthe pact.   Nunn said the futuristic weapons issues could be settled by anamendment to the pact.   The administration has urged ratification without any amendmentsand will likely portray Nunn's proposal as ``a killer amendment,''he said. But ``I don't see this as a killer amendment.''   A so-called killer amendment is one attached to a treaty thatcould make it unacceptable to the parties that negotiated theagreement, and thus ``kill'' the treaty.   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., ranking Republican on the ArmedServices Committee, said the questions should be answered, butnoted, ``there is an advantage to having this ratified'' before thesummit begins.   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Foreign RelationsCommittee, also said he supports speedy ratification so that ``wecan keep this momentum toward arms control.''   The treaty would ban nuclear missiles with a range of 300 to3,400 miles.</TEXT></DOC>
