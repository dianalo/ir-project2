The surprising victory of Democrat Harris Wofford in thePennsylvania Senate race over Dick Thornburgh, a formergovernor and member of the Reagan and Bush cabinets, sent Mr.Bush an unmistakable signal: He'd better produce ahealth-care plan and do whatever it takes, including cuttingtaxes for the middle class, to get the economy out of thedoldrums.</LP><TEXT>   Suddenly uneasy about the 1992 election, Mr. Bush -- wholeft for Rome yesterday, an irony that didn't go unnoticed inthe political rubble here -- has ordered his top-level aidesto develop antidotes to the two issues that transformed Mr.Wofford from an innocuous intellectual into a potentpopulist.   The administration, which for months resisted action onhealth care, now is likely to propose the outlines of acomprehensive health-insurance plan of its own, vastlyincreasing the chances of major changes in the system. Mr.Bush, who acknowledged yesterday that he was &quot;depressed&quot;about Mr. Thornburgh's defeat, is expected to try to counterDemocratic calls for sweeping national health insurance witha more market-oriented proposal. His aim would be to generatemore competition among health-care providers whileguaranteeing health coverage for uninsured Americans.   The president, who has been talking up an economicrecovery that seems illusory to most Americans, will have toheed the clamoring of GOP lawmakers and theoreticians to comeup with something to stimulate the economy. &quot;The Americanpeople are demanding action,&quot; the president said beforeleaving for Italy.   The result is a huge boost in the prospects for a tax cut,probably early next year. The White House is toying with taxincentives for savings and for first-time home buying, and aone-time break for the middle class.   The Democrats are eager to join the fight, and even toturn it into a bidding war. And they will strike hard if theWhite House makes a reduction of the capital-gains tax thecenterpiece of its economic plan.   &quot;That's perfect for us,&quot; said James Carville, theDemocratic consultant who helped Mr. Wofford -- who had been44 points behind in the polls when the campaign began -- tobecome the first Democrat elected to the Senate inPennsylvania in nearly three decades. &quot;If the RepublicanParty and George Bush think the way to beat this is to lowertaxes on people who make over $200,000, then they also thinkRip Van Winkle needs more sleep. It's lunacy.&quot;   Mr. Bush understands the political climate has changed.Even as the votes were being counted in Pennsylvania, hepostponed a 10-day trip to Asia he was scheduled to take latethis month. Instead, he'll concentrate on the domestic issueshis critics argue he has ignored.   The jolt to the White House from Pennsylvania was all themore potent because it was so unexpected. Mr. Thornburgh, awell-known and well-liked two-term governor, was an earlyfavorite over Mr. Wofford, a former Peace Corps official andcollege president who had been appointed to the seat afterthe death of Republican John Heinz.   Mr. Wofford had never won elective office, and early inthe campaign proved himself to be an awkward and discursivecampaigner. But by hitting hard on economic and healthissues, Mr. Wofford seized the initiative. Though he had beenin office for months, he managed to maneuver Mr. Thornburghinto the incumbent role, tarring him with the ills of thepolitical system and portraying the Republican as an elitist.   Across the country, voters expressed impatience,frustration and anger. While it was a sobering day for thepresident, the Democrats didn't savor it, either. ARepublican was elected governor of Mississippi for the firsttime since Reconstruction. And Republicans, riding a wave ofanger about Democratic tax increases, swept into control ofboth houses of the New Jersey Legislature.   The sentiments of New Jersey voters were much the same asthose of their neighbors in Pennsylvania. In New Jersey, asin Pennsylvania, voters were expressing resentment with apolitical establishment that seemed deaf to their concerns.   They tried to make the point a year ago, nearly defeatingpopular Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley after he refused tooppose tax increases. But while Democratic legislators triedto separate themselves from their governor, James Florio,they couldn't move far enough or fast enough. As a result,Republicans now will have veto-proof majorities in bothhouses of the Legislature.   In Washington, some politicians interpreted Tuesday'sresults as a warning signal to both parties. &quot;This needs toconcern incumbents generally, Democrats and Republicans,&quot;said Democratic Sen. Richard Bryan of Nevada. &quot;The messagefrom the heartland is that Washington isn't listening, thatwe are all out of touch.&quot;   Even so, that wake-up call rang loudest in the White Houseand among Republican political strategists who are draftingMr. Bush's re-election plan.   &quot;We have just seen the most enormous red flag in politicalhistory: The 1992 presidential campaign just turned from acakewalk into a 12-month version of World Wide Wrestling,&quot;said Thomas Rath, a former New Hampshire attorney general andRepublican political adviser. &quot;There is tremendous anger outthere, and Thornburgh just revalued the Democraticnomination.&quot;   Republicans, who noted that some GOP wards voted for Mr.Wofford in Pennsylvania, realized how dangerous it can be tobe perceived as Washington insiders. &quot;We now understand asnever before that the pocketbook issues are crucial,&quot; saidGOP Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois. &quot;We can't waft to victory onthings that are the frosting on the cake, like foreignpolicy. That stuff makes you a big hit with the Council onForeign Relations but doesn't do much for you at the RotaryClub.&quot;   In fashioning his new plans, Mr. Bush must keep a closeeye on these restive Republicans. &quot;Hill Republicans may startdrifting away from the president, and this may be a smallreason for it,&quot; said GOP Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi. &quot;Ithasn't happened in great numbers yet, but people here aregetting squirmy. This could be another nudge.&quot;   In this new political order, stimulating the economybecomes the top priority. Already, Republicans are thinkingabout attaching a tax-cutting plan to a bank bailout billthat could reach the House floor this month.   While Mr. Wofford's victory makes a middle-class tax cutmore likely, such a cut probably wouldn't take effect beforeJan. 1, 1993. If history is any guide, Congress will spendmuch of the next year debating tax proposals and won't takeaction until midyear at the earliest. That could provide amodest boost to the economy in future years, but wouldn't domuch to cure the economy's current problems.   Moreover, if forged in the hothouse climate of an electionyear, a tax cut would be likely to balloon the nation'sbudget deficit. Indeed, some economists worry that the meretalk of tax cuts could cause concerns in financial marketsand drive up long-term interest rates. But that won'tnecessarily stop the tax-cut bandwagon, which at this pointis being driven more by politics than economics.   Conservative activists yesterday called a press conferenceto promote their own tax plan. Its elements: a one-yearSocial Security tax cut, reduction of the capital-gains tax,strengthened spending restraints and a 20% investment taxcredit for productive equipment.   &quot;This administration is heading for very, very serioustrouble unless it adopts a clear agenda for the Americanpeople,&quot; said L. Brent Bozell, chairman of the ConservativeVictory Committee. &quot;Rhetoric will not suffice.&quot;   Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, chairman of theSenate Finance Committee and one of the authors of a plan toprovide a $300-per-child tax credit and to expand theavailability and use of individual retirement accounts, saidthe Pennsylvania election had sent a message &quot;that Washingtonis not showing enough concern about things that people areconcerned about, and one of those was the question of taxcuts and tax burdens.&quot;   On health care, the White House is likely to begintackling the issue early this winter. Its strategy istwo-pronged. One is to attack the Democrats, who both inCongress and on the presidential campaign trail are spinningout far-reaching and costly national health-insuranceprograms. The other is to promote its own approach, whichwould rely less on the government. The president is expectedto proffer some specific, narrow proposals on such elementsas changing malpractice statutes and helping small businessprovide coverage, perhaps in the form of tax incentives.   &quot;People want the government to fix this,&quot; said DeborahSteelman, a lobbyist and former Bush campaign aide who headsa government task force on health care. &quot;They want thegovernment to do some common-sense things. But they don'twant to lose choice, control and the private sector.&quot;   The White House is also leaning toward proposing taxcredits to all those below the poverty line -- and a slidingscale for some above it -- for use in paying for managed-careplans or insurance plans.   &quot;Wofford's win is a great victory for health-care reform,&quot;said Democratic Rep. Pete Stark of California, chairman of ahealth subcommittee. &quot;People are sick and tired of apresident, a Cabinet and a Congress who all have excellenttaxpayer-subsidized health plans, but who won't pass nationalhealth-care reform.&quot;   Apart from the specific policy issues that Pennsylvaniahas brought to the fore, GOP strategists see broaderpolitical lessons. &quot;Republicans have been lazyintellectually,&quot; said Republican pollster Linda DiVall.&quot;There was a message {Tuesday} of voters saying: `Don't takeme for granted, I don't want to hear a defense of the statusquo, things aren't going fine. And how are you going to makethings better?'&quot;   William McInturff, another GOP pollster, observed, &quot;Whentimes are hard, you want to have a hard-edged message aboutwhat you're going to do to help people.&quot; As a result, anumber of administration strategists believe the Pennsylvaniaresults strengthen the hand of policy hard-liners. Thesehard-liners have urged Mr. Bush to become moreconfrontational with the Democratic-controlled Congress evenif it means losing some legislative battles.   Among Democrats, one unanticipated result of Mr. Wofford'svictory is the elevation of his consultant, Mr. Carville, tonear-mythic proportions. The Louisianan, a tenaciouspolitical guerrilla, now is being regarded among Democrats asa prophetic figure with a vision to enable the party toreturn to the White House.   &quot;There's going to be real anger against the Republicans ifthe Democrats are smart and lay out what happened to the richand what happened to the middle class during the last 11years,&quot; he said. &quot;The Democrats have to talk about reversingthings, and they have to be very specific.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
