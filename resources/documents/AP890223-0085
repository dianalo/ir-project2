The killing late Wednesday was the fourth in the past two monthsthat has involved people connected directly or indirectly to Mrs.Mandela and her unofficial group of bodyguards known as the MandelaUnited soccer club.   Police said gunmen fired on the house with an AK-47 rifle and setthe dwelling ablaze with a firebomb. The name of the slain girl wasnot released.   A few hours before the attack, an occupant of the house wasdetained in connection with the killing last week of MaxwellMadondo, a member of Mandela United, police said. They declined torelease the name of the person detained.   ``The possibility that the attack on the house may have a bearingon the murder of Mr. Madondo and is possibly a revenge attack isbeing investigated,'' police headquarters said in a statement.   Madondo's body, with several stab wounds, was found last weekless than 30 yards from house that was attacked Wednesday. A formermember of Mandela United, Andrew Ekaneng, has been charged withMadondo's killing but has yet to enter a plea.   The attack Wednesday is the latest development in the controversythat centers on Mrs. Mandela and Mandela United members, who livedat her home in Soweto, the huge township outside Johannesburg.   Anti-apartheid leaders last week accused Mandela United of waginga ``reign of terror,'' renounced Mrs. Mandela and urged theirfollowers not to associate with her. Mrs. Mandela's husband, AfricanNational Congress leader Nelson Mandela, has been imprisoned for 27years but remains the country's best known black figure.   In addition to the deaths of the teen-age girl and Madondo, twoother people with links to Mrs. Mandela and her bodyguards have beenkilled in recent weeks.   Stompie Seipei, a 14-year-old activist was allegedly beaten atthe Mandela home by soccer club members. His decomposed body wasfound in January, and two members of the soccer club have beencharged with his murder, as well as with the abduction and assaultof three young men.   Dr. Abu Baker Asvat, a Soweto physician and political activist,was shot and killed at his clinic last month. Two men have beencharged with the murder, and police have said they believe themotive was robbery.   However, there have been unconfirmed reports that on the daybefore he died, Asvat examined Seipei, who allegedly had been badlybeaten.   Mrs. Mandela has suggested that Asvat may have been killedbecause he had examined Seipei and other youths who she said weresexually molested by a Methodist minister in Soweto. Churchofficials have denied the charges.</TEXT></DOC>
