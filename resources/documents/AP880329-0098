(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Surrogate mother Mary BethWhitehead-Gould testified today that Baby M has a right to see herand would benefit from spending time with her and her family.   ``It's her right more so than anybody's right for her to seeme,'' Mrs. Whitehead-Gould told Superior Court Judge Birger M.Sween on the second day of a hearing to determine how much time shecan spend with the child she bore under a $10,000 contract but thenrefused to give up.   Speaking calmly, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, 30, asked for immediatevisits at her home and eventual overnight stays with expansion ofher time with the child, now 2, to include half the summer and someholidays. Mother and child now visit once a week for two hours,supervised at a social services center.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould said she has much to offer the child, nowlegally Melissa Stern. She said the child could benefit by thesupport of Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's family, including her husband,accountant Dean Gould, and her children by a previous marriage,Ryan, 13, and Tuesday, 12.   She said the visitation schedule initially must be carefullyspelled out by the court to make it easier for both sides in thebitter dispute to get along.   On Monday, the child's father, William Stern, 42, in bittertestimony that ended in tears, said Mrs. Whitehead-Gould isuntrustworthy and could undermine the child's relationship with himand his wife.   In the final legal phase of the Baby M case, Stern asked thejudge to halt visitation for several years, perhaps until her 10thbirthday, saying contact with Mrs. Whitehead-Gould couldemotionally harm the child.   ``I'm afraid that she will never let Melissa be her ownperson,'' he said in 2{ hours of testimony. ``Mary Beth is a liar.... I can't trust her.''   In later testimony, Stern's wife, Elizabeth, said she and Mrs.Whitehead-Gould were ``poles apart.''   ``I don't have any respect for her. ... I'd never choose her asmy friend. And quite simply, too much has gone on,'' Mrs. Sternsaid.   Stern said he feared Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, who lost a highlypublicized custody battle, would exploit Melissa to promote herbook about the case.   The hearing was ordered by the New Jersey Supreme Court in itslandmark Feb. 3 decision that declared surrogacy-for-pay illegaland restored Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's parental rights, but awardedSterns custody.   The Sterns paid Mrs. Whitehead-Gould $10,000 to bear them achild because they feared 42-year-old Mrs. Stern, who suffers amild form of multiple sclerosis, would suffer complications duringpregnancy. Mrs. Whitehead-Gould was artificially inseminated withStern's sperm.   Under cross-examination, the Sterns acknowledged that Melissadoes not seem to have been harmed by her contact with Mrs.Whitehead-Gould.   When the judge asked him what kind of religion Melissa would beexposed to, Stern, who is Jewish and whose relatives other than hisparents all died in the Holocaust, wept. After composing himself,he said he expects to expose her to the Unitarian Church. Mrs.Stern is not Jewish.</TEXT></DOC>
