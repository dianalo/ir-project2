Revenue fell to $255.3 million from $285.6 million. NVRattributed the drop to downsizing of the partnership,consistent with a business plan implemented last year, and tomarket conditions that have led to a larger percentage of itsnew home sales coming from lower-priced homes.   Dwight C. Schar, chairman, said the partnership iscurrently encountering &quot;adverse fluctuations in thealready-down market. These market conditions will probablytranslate into a loss in our fourth quarter. Nevertheless, weare confident that losses of the magnitude that we incurredin recent times are behind us.&quot;   NVR reported a 1990 fourth-quarter net loss of $36.0million, or $1.29 a share, including a pretax charge of $21.1million related to restructuring.   Mr. Schar said the company's restructuring effortencompasses the partnership's principal borrowing facilitiesand its subordinated debt obligations.</TEXT></DOC>
