Thetechnique is useful for characterizing, at room temperature, differencesbetween {beta}-, {beta}'-, and {alpha}'-type structures vs. {alpha}-structures.The {beta}-,{beta}', and {alpha}'-type structure show a vibrational featuresat {similar_to}1280 cm{sup -1} which has been assigned as the -C-C-Hbending vibration and is absent in the spectrum of the {alpha}-type salts.This vibration shifts toward higher frequency in going from the PT tothe ET salts, and the results indicate stronger hydrogen bonding andharder lattices in the ET salts as opposed to the PT salts. This frequencyshift also appears to be a function of the electronegativity of the halogenin the anion moiety of the charge-transfer salt.</TEXT></DOC>
