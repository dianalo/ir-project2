Based on a review of 1987 U.S. farm census figures, only 19percent of the nation's cotton farm operators reported anotherprincipal occupation, compared with 45 percent for U.S. farmoperators in general.   However, only about half of the cotton farmers lived on thefarms they operated in 1987, compared with 71 percent for farmersin general.   The study by Leslie A. Meyer and Scott Sanford of thedepartment's Economic Research Service compared some of thecharacteristics of cotton farming with other types of agricultureand how those changed since 1982.   According to the census of agriculture, which is taken everyfive years, the typical cotton farm operator is male, white andapproximately 50 years old.   ``However, female, younger, and certain minority operators arebecoming more prevalent, and one would expect them to play anincreasing role in the future operations of cotton farms,'' thereport said.   Women increased their share of cotton farming to 3.5 percent in1987 from 3 percent in 1982, with the largest number of femaleoperators in Texas and Mississippi.   Despite the gain, women ``were still under-represented relativeto the 6.3 percent operating U.S. farms of all kinds,'' the reportsaid.   Although there is ``no definitive explanation'' for the gradualincrease in female-operated farms, the report speculated that thetrend may be attributed to several factors:   _The willingness of women to identify themselves as principalfarm operators.   _A possible increase in unwillingness among young widows to selltheir farms or leave farming upon the death of a spouse.   _A rise in the number of young women who feel the call and havethe confidence to run a farm.   Under a ``standard industrial classification'' definition usedby the Commerce Department, a cotton farm is one that derives atleast 50 percent of its total annual sales value from cottonproduction.   Although acknowledging ``there are many farms that producecotton,'' the study dealt only with those ``SIC farms'' defined byCommerce. Those totaled 27,673 farms in 1987, up 32 percent from21,041 counted in the 1982 farm census, reflecting further emphasison cotton among farm operators.   By comparison, U.S. farm numbers in general declined to fewerthan 2.2 million in 1987 from about 2.4 million in 1982.   Leading states for cotton farms were reported as Texas, 11,741farms in 1987 and 9,242 in 1982; Mississippi, 3,176 and 2,692; andLouisiana, 2,223 and 1,899.   The study showed that in 1987 about 69 percent of the so-calledSIC cotton farms contained 260 acres or more, compared with lessthan 65 percent in 1982.   States with the largest percentage of cotton farms 260 acres ormore were: South Carolina, 76 percent; Arizona, 74.1; Texas, 73.7;and Georgia, 64.5. In addition, 15.5 percent of South Carolina'scotton farms were 2,000 acres or more, compared with 12.5 percentin Mississippi and 9.8 percent in Arizona.   At the opposite end, small farms of fewer than 100 acresrepresented only 13.9 percent of the total SIC cotton farms in1987, compared with 17.5 percent of the total in the 1982 census.   States with the highest percentages of small cotton farmsincluded New Mexico, 33.8 percent; Tennessee, 29.7 percent; andNorth Carolina, 24.1 percent.   ``Both censuses demonstrate that the preponderance of U.S.cotton farmers are white,'' the report said. ``The proportion ofminorities decreased from 5 percent to 3 percent between 1982 and1987, with all states except New Mexico and North Carolina showingdeclines.''   However, the report added, ``The absolute number of minoritycotton farm operators increased in Arizona, New Mexico, NorthCarolina, Tennessee and Texas. Mississippi had the largest numberof minority operators in both 1982 and 1987.''   Minority cotton farm operators in both 1982 and 1987 ``were morelikely than white to own the land they operated and somewhat lesslikely to be tenants,'' the report said. ``However, by 1987minority operators as a group were more likely to be part owners ortenants and less likely to be full owners than they had been in1982.''   The report added: ``This shift toward more tenants and fewerfull owners was also apparent among white operators, althoughblacks and other (minority) operators exhibited adisproportionately large drop in their incidence of fullownership.''   In 1982 and 1987, the age group of 55 to 64 was the largest forcotton farmers, with an average age of 48.8 years in 1982 and 49.7in 1987, with the youngest in Georgia (45.9 in 1987) and the oldestin Oklahoma (51.9).   ``Thus, the average age of the U.S. cotton farm operatorincreased only slightly,'' the report said. ``The slim advance canbe attributed to the meager expansion of the average age range ofoperators in the producing states.''</TEXT></DOC>
