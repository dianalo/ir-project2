Crude-oil prices hit an 11-year low near $10 a barrel in July 1986, but have averaged at least $6 a barrel more in the third quarter this year than in the like period last year.    Companies heavily involved in refining and marketing generally showed smaller gains, as those &quot;downstream&quot; operations have had smaller profit margins lately. Chemical-producing subsidiaries showed strong earnings.    Earnings for the quarter more than tripled at the Shell Oil Co. unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group and at Atlantic Richfield Co., but there were more-modest gains at most big, integrated companies. Net income rose 1% at Exxon Corp., 18% at Occidental Petroleum Corp. and 33% at Unocal Corp. Mobil Corp.'s earnings were up 75%, but profit from its petroleum operations declined 12% for the quarter.    Atlantic Richfield Co.   Los Angeles-based Arco's third-quarter sales jumped 24% to $4.40 billion from $3.53 billion.    Arco's chairman, Lodwrick M. Cook, said the surge in earnings showed the impact of higher crude prices on oil and gas operations, a strong performance by the Arco Chemical Co. unit, and higher crude and natural gas liquids production. He said lower refining and marketing earnings, reflecting &quot;significantly lower&quot; margins for petroleum products, partly offset the increases.    Earnings from Arco's world-wide oil and gas exploration and production rose to $235 million from $41 million in the year-earlier three months. Arco produced more oil at its Alaskan North Slope operations, though production was lower in the rest of the U.S. The refining and marketing business reported earnings of $30 million, down from $94 million in the 1986 quarter.    In the first nine months this year, Arco's sales rose 7.7% to $12.24 billion from $11.37 billion.    Exxon Corp.   Exxon's scant 1% third-quarter earnings increase reflected a standoff that was characteristic of the whole industry: improved results in exploration and production counterbalanced by poor results in refining and marketing.    Revenue rose 27% to $21.93 billion from $17.19 billion in last year's third quarter. The company's profit margin for the quarter slipped to 4.9%, compared with 6.1% in the 1986 period.    L.G. Rawl, Exxon's chairman, said crude-oil prices averaged $6.50 a barrel more in this year's third period than in the year-earlier period. That helped earnings at the company's exploration and production divisions, which had profit of $933 million, up $391 million from the third quarter of 1986.    But the refining and marketing side posted only a $60 million profit, down from $463 million in the 1986 quarter. The New York-based company said margins were &quot;squeezed by a combination of higher crude prices and marketplace pressures.&quot; Mr. Rawl called the refining and marketing results &quot;below acceptable levels.&quot;    Of the $60 million in refining profit, only $7 million came from U.S. operations, down sharply from $106 million in the third quarter of 1986. Foreign refining and marketing operations chipped in $53 million of earnings for the quarter, down from $357 million in the 1986 quarter.    Chemical operations contributed earnings of $152 million, up $38 million, or 33%, from the like quarter last year.    The company stepped up capital and exploration spending to $1.98 billion in the quarter, a rise of $451 million from last year's third quarter, mainly because of increased activity in Australia.    The company declined to discuss possible steps to improve profitability in the refining and marketing operations. Brian Jacoboski, an oil analyst at Paine Webber Inc., said Exxon has been rumored to be discussing the sale of its European refining operations to Saudi Arabian interests, and he believes the rumor is true.    An Exxon spokeswoman yesterday declined to confirm or deny the report. She said the company doesn't comment on &quot;rumors of acquisitions, mergers, or divestments.&quot;    In the first nine months this year, revenue was $61.53 billion, up 7% from last year's figure of $57.41 billion.    Mobil Corp.   While New York-based Mobil reported a 75% earnings gain for the third quarter, year-earlier amounts are adjusted for a loss on the sale of its Container Corp. of America subsidiary. Before the adjustment, third-quarter earnings show a 4% decline.    In the 1986 third quarter, Mobil took a $150 million loss on the Container Corp. sale. Without that loss, third-quarter earnings in 1986 would have been $332 million.    Revenue was $14.44 billion, up 27% from $11.31 billion in the 1986 quarter.    Overall, Mobil's chairman, Allen E. Murray, said petroleum earnings declined 12% in the third quarter, to $397 million from $453 million a year earlier.    The exploration and production segments were strong, producing profit of $326 million world-wide, compared with $130 million in last year's third quarter.    But refining and marketing earnings plunged to $71 million from $323 million in the year-earlier period.    Mobil's chemical operations showed $92 million in profit for the quarter, a record and a 142% increase from the 1986 third quarter. Mobil's retailing unit, Montgomery Ward, reported profit for the September quarter of $21 million, up $8 million from the like period last year.    Capital expenditures, including oil-exploration outlays, rose 22% in the third quarter to $828 million from $681 million last year. But in the nine-month period, they were down 5% to $2.09 billion from $2.19 billion.    For the first nine months, Mobil reported revenue of $40.76 billion, up 9% from $37.37 billion in the 1986 period.    Occidental Petroleum Corp.   For Occidental, a redemption of preferred shares reduced preferred dividend requirements and accounted for the relatively sharp third-quarter per-share net rise. Sales were $4.22 billion, up 14% from $3.72 billion.    Armand Hammer, chairman, said Los Angeles-based Occidental's oil and gas division had $58 million of pretax earnings, compared with a loss of $3 million in the 1986 period. Higher crude prices accounted for the oil and gas rise in earnings, although declining natural gas prices offset some of that increase. He said higher domestic natural gas production and natural gas liquids sales also contributed to the increase.    The natural gas transmission business had pretax earnings of $17 million in the quarter, down from $68 million last year, reflecting Occidental's sale last June of United Gas Pipe Line Co., higher depreciation expense and lower sales volume.    Occidental's chemical business had income of $49 million, up from $26 million in the year-earlier quarter. It recorded higher sales for its electrochemicals, detergent and specialty products, and for polymers and plastics, and had higher margins for its olefins and agricultural products, Occidental said.    Occidental's 1986 quarter included a $106 million gain on the sale of stock. It said its tax rate in the latest quarter was lower, reflecting the reduction of its ownership of the IBP Inc. meatpacking unit to 51%.    In the nine months, sales rose 14% to $12.71 billion from $11.18 billion.    Shell Oil Co.   Houston-based Shell reported that third-quarter net more than tripled, largely because of the increase in crude-oil prices and a record profit from chemical earnings. Revenue rose 40% to $5.65 billion from $4.01 billion.    But like other major integrated oil companies, Shell's refining and marketing operations were hurt, as oil-product earnings declined 13% to $68 million. Refining and marketing operations for most major U.S. oil companies were hurt in the third quarter because competitive pricing didn't allow product prices to keep pace with the rise in crude prices.    That rise in crude prices, however, provided a big lift to exploration and production, or &quot;upstream,&quot; earnings. Shell's upstream profit in the quarter surged to $262 million from $25 million. Shell said domestic crude prices averaged nearly $17 a barrel in the quarter, up about $6 from a year earlier, which, combined with lower production costs, boosted profit. A 5% decline in natural gas prices somewhat impaired earnings.    Petrochemical operations were standouts for most major oil companies in the quarter because of strong demand and improved margins, and Shell was no exception. The company said chemical-product earnings rose nearly 150% to a record $131 million.    As oil prices recovered, Shell increased its capital spending on exploration and production for oil and gas to $449 million from $359 million.    Unocal Corp.   Los Angeles-based Unocal's third-quarter revenue rose 35% to $2.58 billion from $1.91 billion.    Unocal's chairman, Fred L. Hartley, said lower U.S. taxes on foreign operations helped the company, along with higher crude prices and increased natural gas sales volumes. Those gains, however, were substantially offset by sharply lower refining and marketing margins, lower natural gas and geothermal-energy prices, reduced crude production and lower chemical earnings.    In the first nine months, revenue rose 12% to $7.06 billion from $6.30 billion.    ---                         1987              1986                      in      per       in      per      %                   millions  share   millions  share    chg.
