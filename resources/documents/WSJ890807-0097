Saunders III, a managing director of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. and chairman of its leveraged buy-out fund, said he resigned to pursue other, unspecified interests.    Mr. Saunders, 53 years old, was responsible for raising $2.3 billion for Morgan's Leveraged Equity Fund II from U.S., Middle East and Asian investors. The LBO fund is considered the largest of its type by a securities firm, and it has backed numerous buy-outs and takeovers including Colt Industries Inc., Fort Howard Corp. and Cullum Companies Inc.    In a terse internal memorandum, Morgan Chairman S. Parker Gilbert said Morgan regretted Mr. Saunders's departure, which takes effect Thursday. Officials at several of Morgan Stanley's competitors said Mr. Saunders's departure may have been accelerated because of conflict among the investment-banking, merchant-banking and corporate-finance divisions at the firm. Mr. Saunders said in an interview that he &quot;feels very close to Morgan Stanley as an institution&quot; and that his resignation &quot;has nothing whatsoever&quot; to do with any professional rivalries within the firm.    For much of his 22 years at Morgan Stanley, Mr. Saunders was the public face of the firm, managing its syndicate department for 10 years and acting as the firm's senior representative in several major transactions, including American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s $3.8 billion stock offering in 1981, its $150 billion divestiture of its Bell system telephone companies in 1984 and the $4.8 billion privatization of British Telecom during the mid-1980s.    Mr. Saunders, like many senior officials at Morgan Stanley, became an instant multimillionaire after the firm sold its stock to the public earlier in the decade. He declined to discuss his net worth, which company documents and colleagues say totals tens of millions of dollars.    &quot;I just felt it was an appropriate time to pursue business ideas of my own,&quot; Mr. Saunders said. &quot;I'm not going to retire, but I'm unlikely to go to any large investment banking firm&quot; that rivals Morgan Stanley. &quot;I prefer not to say anything more than that.&quot;    He added: &quot;I felt the LBO activities at Morgan Stanley were in great shape, and I felt I could leave with a great feeling that we had just increased the size of the fund from $1.6 billion.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
