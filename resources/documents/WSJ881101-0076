Robert Davis of Michigan while he sat on the Armed Services Committee. Now his election opponent is running television commercials about the payments saying, &quot;What Bob Davis has done is not illegal, but does that make it right?&quot;    Military contractors also paid $27,000 last year to Rep. Marilyn Lloyd of Tennessee. Now her opponent is attacking such fees as &quot;corrupting&quot; and demanding that she return the money.    Just a few months ago, Rep. James Hansen of Utah skipped a House vote on a popular health-care bill and made a paid appearance in Las Vegas instead. Now his opponent is calling for such fees to be outlawed, and running radio ads saying the incumbent &quot;missed the vote by collecting money for himself.&quot;    For years, lawmakers have mostly shrugged off ethical and legal questions raised by personal-appearance fees received from lobbyists. But as they head home to run for re-election, some are starting to feel political heat, a matter they seem to treat more seriously.    In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, nearly two-thirds of those surveyed favored outlawing the lucrative and rapidly growing practice. The fees reached $10 million last year, up from $2 million in 1980. Congressional leaders are planning a serious attempt next year to ban such fees while granting a substantial pay increase to make up for the lost income. But the poll also found that eight in 10 of those surveyed disapproved of a pay increase, even if coupled with such a ban.    The fees, called honorariums or honoraria, are a relic of the days when they were paid largely by churches, civic groups, colleges or others who expected full-length speeches or articles in return. Now the payments are mostly a means for lobbyists to purchase access.    One lobby, the U.S. Telephone Association, nearly tripled its honorariums, making payments to more than one House or Senate member each week, on average. The lawmakers typically received $1,000 each, but often $2,000, for appearances at seminars and breakfast meetings attended by 20 to 25 telephone executives and lobbyists. &quot;You just want to get acquainted with the people,&quot; says Ward White, the association's vice president for government and public affairs. &quot;A lot of times we don't even talk to them about the issues. We may take it up with them later.&quot;    Paying fees is a highly cost-effective way to make a case. The telephone association's payments last year totaled just over $72,000, but it was lobbying strenuously on issues worth billions of dollars to its member companies.    One such measure was a House bill favored by consumer groups to accelerate the benefit to utility customers of lower corporate income-tax rates enacted in 1986. Mr. White estimated the proposal could have cost his industry $7 billion. Although the measure had 46 co-sponsors and advanced to public hearings, it later died in the Ways and Means Committee.    From a lobbyist's perspective, paying honorariums is an accepted and useful practice. They are paid regularly by Chicago commodity brokers and lobbyists for truckers, broadcasters, stockbrokers, cigarette makers and military contractors, among others. &quot;It just seems to be the typical way of doing business here in Washington,&quot; Mr. White observes.    To some others, the fees look like outright payoffs. When Boston's racket-busting federal prosecutor William Weld first came to Washington to head the Justice Department's criminal division in 1986, he was startled to read a news story that United Coal Co. paid several Democratic House members $2,000 each to take a trip by private jet to tour a Virginia coal mine and to discuss mine-safety legislation at a private dinner.    Mr. Weld's first instinct was to seek federal indictments of the congressmen, just as he had formerly prosecuted policemen, building inspectors and scores of other state and local officials for taking illegal payments.    &quot;This sounded to me, fresh from the hinterlands, like a prima facie criminal violation,&quot; Mr. Weld recalls. But for members of Congress, he was surprised to discover, honorariums are legal. (Mr. Weld resigned his post earlier this year, out of concern over then-Attorney General Edwin Meese's ethics problems.)    Honorariums are indeed illegal for other governmental officials. Moreover, some legal experts suggest that lobbyists and lawmakers have strayed so far from the original purpose of honorariums that another prosecutor might someday seek indictments.    &quot;Honoraria can only be accepted under the fiction that it's payment for services rendered,&quot; says Stanley Brand, former counsel to the House of Representatives. When used as a lobbying tool, he says, &quot;a prosecutor may decide that it's gone over the line from a payment to a gift or gratuity or bribe.&quot;    In any event, honorariums from lobbies are already starting to cause some intense political embarrassment. In June, Democratic congresswoman Lloyd of Tennessee gave back $2,000 she had taken from the Oshkosh Truck Corp. after news stories appeared linking the fee to a vote she had cast on an Armed Services subcommittee to force additional purchases of the company's trucks by the Army. Mrs. Lloyd accepted the money several days after the vote, for a dinner speech that she didn't even have to write herself. It was prepared by House aides, her spokeswoman says.    Mrs. Lloyd says she doesn't see anything wrong with the money she took. In fact, she says, the public benefits when lawmakers visit the companies that pay them. She was paid by 16 companies last year, all but one of them military suppliers. Besides Oshkosh, the list includes General Dynamics, LTV, Boeing, Rockwell, McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed and Northrop. Most of them also paid her way to tour weapons facilities in California, Texas and elsewhere. &quot;I really learned a lot,&quot; she says. &quot;I really grew as a member.&quot;    She says she returned the Oshkosh money -- 14 months after it was paid -- only because it looked bad when reported: &quot;I think that perception is reality; if you look fat on television, you're fat.&quot;    In the past, criticism of honorariums has come largely from newspaper editorialists and groups such as Common Cause, a 280,000-member organizaion that lobbies for tighter congressional ethics rules. Its president, Fred Wertheimer, has for years been proposing to banish honorariums. &quot;They are undermining the integrity of Congress,&quot; he says.    Now some candidates are starting to sound the same theme. &quot;It's corrupting the whole process,&quot; says Harold Coker, Mrs. Lloyd's GOP opponent. &quot;An honorarium is an extra payment to a member of Congress for doing something that they should have done anyway. At worst, it's a camouflage for vote-buying.&quot; He vows never to accept honorariums himself, and promises that if elected he would quickly sponsor legislation to banish them. Mr. Coker's campaign began running new television ads yesterday saying Mrs. Lloyd has &quot;taken thousands of dollars in special-interest money.&quot;    The honorarium issue is bipartisan. A Democratic candidate, Michigan state Sen. Mitch Irwin, is also criticizing the system in his campaign against Rep. Davis, a Republican.    Mr. Irwin says the incumbent voted against changes in Pentagon procurement practices while taking money from suppliers accused of overcharging. &quot;Our congressman got a 30% {salary} bonus from the contractors,&quot; he says. &quot;I think we ought to be sending watchdogs to Congress, not lapdogs for the Southern California defense contractors.&quot;    Rep. Davis accuses Mr. Irwin of being a bit of a hypocrite; the state senator himself took $1,500 in honorariums last year. Mr. Irwin responds that all his fees came from three Michigan groups, including a college, that didn't provide additional reimbursement for expenses. Anyway, Mr. Irwin says, the system needs reform. &quot;I would support a complete ban on speaking fees,&quot; he says.    Incumbents insist such attacks are desperation tactics that won't work. &quot;My constituency doesn't seem to care,&quot; says Rep. Lloyd. She says a recent poll shows her with a lead over Mr. Coker. But she won't make the poll public, and meanwhile has ceased taking any more fees this year.    Rep. Davis has also stopped taking additional fees, but only because he has already reached the legal maximum for this year, according to an aide. He declined to be interviewed for this article, but his spokeswoman, Denise Fee, says there is nothing wrong with taking fees. &quot;Obviously it's right, because it's legal,&quot; she says. &quot;The majority of the members of Congress do it.&quot;    That's true. Under current law, which of course is written by Congress itself, House and Senate members may accept as much as $2,000 per appearance, up to a yearly limit of 30% of salary for House members and 40% for senators. This year, the ceilings amount to $26,850 in the House and $35,800 in the Senate.    With lobbyists' money so easily available, more members are taking fees. Last year 84% of House members accepted fees averaging $14,070 each, exclusive of amounts donated to charity. And 79 senators last year received an average of $27,977 each, after deducting donations. Only a few members of Congress either refuse to take fees or give whatever honorariums they earn to charity.    The total amounts received as honorariums have grown enormously. Since 1980, senators have nearly tripled their total to more than $3 million, of which 27% went to charity. Meanwhile, House members have increased their total more than six-fold to $6.7 million, of which 22% was donated.    &quot;We're going to become a banana republic, the way it's going,&quot; laments former Rep. Gunn McKay of Utah. When he was in office in the 1970s, many senators commanded sizable totals, but few House members did. Mr. McKay himself listed only three payments totaling $1,100 on the last report he filed as a House member. But the man who defeated him in 1980, Republican Rep. Hansen, got $18,000 last year, mostly from Pentagon contractors.    Mr. McKay, a Democrat, now is trying to reclaim his old seat and is attacking Rep. Hansen's speaking fees, including a $500 payment the incumbent took last June 2 for addressing a conservative group on wilderness issues in Las Vegas. At the time, the House was overwhelmingly approving a bill to finance health care for victims of catastrophic illnesses. Mr. McKay's radio ads portray Rep. Hansen as more interested in lining his own pocket than in helping needy constituents.    Mr. McKay's latest TV commercial, which began running last week, says Rep. Hansen voted against measures to combat Pentagon fraud and abuse and then last year took $16,000 in speaking fees from defense contractors. &quot;Do you believe that's a coincidence?&quot; the narrator asks. &quot;It's time for Gunn McKay to put the strength of ethics back into our national defense.&quot;    The fee system has grown so large and visible, in fact, that some think it may collapse of its own weight. Some military contractors have scaled back or eliminated honorariums, at least for the time being, because of a Pentagon procurement scandal. Democratic House leaders have signaled to Common Cause that they intend to push next year for outlawing such payments as part of a package including a big pay raise for themselves.    Says California Democratic Rep. Vic Fazio, chairman of the subcommittee that handles appropriations for running Congress: &quot;I think it would improve public perception of the institution if we take straight salary instead of outside income.&quot;    ---                 Top Honoraria Payers, 1987                                                 Change                                      1987       From 1986                                    Payments   (in percent)   Chicago Board of   Trade/Chicago Merc.              $130,469       +66%   American Trucking   Associations                      117,500       +37   National Association   of Broadcasters                   114,300       +19   Securities Industry   Association                       110,000       +97   Tobacco Institute                 102,000       +36   PaineWebber                       100,000       -18   National Restaurant   Association                        89,450       +44   Connell Rice andamp; Sugar               84,000        +6   U.S. Telephone   Association                        72,250      +178   E.
