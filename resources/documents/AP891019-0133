The prospects for achieving further pay increases for women andminorities in the 1990s are bright, the study and its sponsorssaid, because of the attention focused on the issue and becausethose groups will represent the majority of new entrants in the jobmarket.   ``What the 1980s have done is establish pay equity as a viableway to end wage discrimination,'' said Claudia E. Wayne, executivedirector of the National Committee on Pay Equity. ``We have madeinroads and now in the 1990s we will move forward by focusing ongrass-roots education, legislation, litigation, collectivebargaining and other means of making additional progress.''   The committee's study, a compilation of the results of state andlocal pay-equity drives since 1979, found that all but five stateshave studied whether their pay scales are fair to women. Alsolaunching such studies were scores of city, county and localgovernments and nearly 200 public colleges and universities, thereport said.   As a result, 20 state governments have negotiated pay increasestotaling more than $382 million in the past 10 years and cities,counties and school districts have raised salaries more than $72million, according to the study.   ``A decade-long movement for pay equity has resulted in bankablejustice for tens of thousands of public workers,'' said Wayne. Inthe jurisdictions that made made pay adjustments, the costs haveaveraged between 2 percent and 5 percent of total payroll, she said.   Census Bureau data for both public and private sector workersshows that in 1988, the average annual pay of women was $17,606, or66 percent of the $26,656 average for men. In 1979, women made 59percent the amount made by men.   The Census statistics show black men averaged 74.8 percent ofthe wages paid white men last year while Hispanic men on averagewere paid 65.5 percent of what white men were paid.   White women were paid an average annual salary of $17,851 lastyear, 65.4 percent of the $27,228 paid white men, the Censusfigures showed. Black women and Hispanic women were paid 60.7percent and 54.5 percent, respectively, of the totals for white men.   The committee's study was most encouraging for women, showingthat every state except Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia andIdaho had studied or were studying how women in the state workforce are paid. But only three states have expanded those reviewsto study whether minorities receive comparable pay _ New York, NewJersey and Wisconsin.   ``The tackling of race-based wage discrimination problems hascome just recently,'' Wayne said. ``I think that more and more inthe future those who are tracking the issue will look at both raceand sex.''   Many states that have studied pay equity have yet to implement aplan to correct any discrimination, the report said, suggestingthat advocates of pay equity _ also often referred to as comparablepay _ still face a daunting task, particularly in states withfiscal problems.   To help overcome such obstacles, Wayne said unions, whichrepresent a majority of public-sector workers, are in most casesnot seeking back pay adjustments and are willing to receive payimprovements for women and minorities through incremental steps.   She said the committee had no solid data on pay equity inprivate businesses but said corporate leaders contacted by theorganization ``are of the opinion that pay equity makes goodbusiness sense.''</TEXT></DOC>
