On other markets, stock-index futures surged; precious metalsfutures fell; energy futures dropped sharply; grains and soybeansadvanced; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.   The Labor Department's report that the jobless rate rose to 5.6percent in August was good news to bond futures traders who hadbeen worried the economy was expanding too quickly.   But even more welcome was the news that the average hourlyearnings index, a measure of wages, rose just 0.1 percent lastmonth after gaining 0.4 percent in July, said Sam Kahan, aneconomist with Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. inChicago.   ``The market was saying to itself, `Hey, look, the unemploymentrate is going down, yet the economy is strong and the cost of laborhas not accelerated all that much,''' Kahan said. ``So they decided... inflation was not accelerating as much as was fearedheretofore.''   The contract for December delivery of the U. S. Treasury bondrose 2 3-32 points to 87 19-32. On cash markets, the yield on thebenchmark 30-year bond dropped to 9.14 percent from 9.30 percent.   Stock-index futures also soared in reaction to the jobless rate.On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the contract for Septemberdelivery of the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 index finished 6.80 pointshigher at 265.60.   Precious-metals futures initially plunged on the unemploymentnews, with platinum down nearly $19 a troy ounce at midday.   Precious metals, commonly seen as an investment hedge againstinflation, tend to rise and fall with inflationary expectations.Friday's sharply lower crude oil prices added to the bearish tonein the metals markets, analysts said.   But precious metals prices recovered late in the session toclose only modestly lower.   Peter Cardillo, commodities trading adviser with Josephthal andamp;Co. in New York, said the metals markets remained technically weakdespite the comeback.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum settled $7.90 to$8.20 lower with October at $523.50 a troy ounce. On New York'sCommodity Exchange, gold settled 90 cents to $2.70 lower withOctober at $431.80 a troy ounce; silver was 5.6 cents to 8 centslower with September at $6.518 a troy ounce.   Energy futures prices settled sharply lower on the New YorkMercantile Exchange, capping a bearish week brought on by reportsof more OPEC overproduction.   Crude oil for October delivery slid to a seven-week low,breaking a key support level of $15.10 a barrel and dragging othercontract months down. Contracts for refined petroleum products alsofinished down sharply.   Analysts linked the week's decline to reports that some membersof the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries werecontinuing to ignore production quotas, increasing the world's oilsupply and further weakening prices.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 29 cents to 33 centslower with October at $14.79 a barrel; heating oil was .40 cent to.58 cent lower with October at 42.88 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was .38 cent to .73 cent lower with October at 43.98 centsa gallon.   Grain and soybean futures finished mostly higher on the ChicagoBoard of Trade in a late surge fueled by technical factors in theabsence of new supply-and-demand developments.   After the close, the Agriculture Department announced sales of800,000 metric tons of U.S. corn to the Soviet Union. Rumors of alarge corn sale to the Soviets had boosted corn futures pricesearlier in the week.   Wheat settled } cent to 4 cents higher with September at $4.01 abushel; corn was unchanged to 1{ cents higher with September at$2.90{ a bushel; oats were } cent lower to { cent higher withSeptember at $2.59{ a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents lower to 7{cents higher with September at $8.73 a bushel.   Cattle futures posted strong gains in a late surge ofpre-weekend position squaring on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.Pork futures retreated on fears of slackening demand.
