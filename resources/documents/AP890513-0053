Students and Kwangju residents pushed and shoved riot policeguarding a square in front the provincial government building asspeakers denounced the government of President Roh Tae-woo.   Troopers rushed out with truncheons and shields, hitting andkicking the protesters, to stop them from reaching the governmentbuilding.   But police did not prevent about 10,000 people from holding arally in the square in front of the building in this provincialcapital 170 miles south of Seoul. There were no immediate reportsof injuries and arrests.   Protesters cheered and applauded as their leaders called for anationwide movement to topple Roh and expel U.S. troops from SouthKorea. Speakers accused Roh of attempting to impose authoritarianrule and the crowd responded with chants of ``Down with RohTae-woo!''   Earlier, demonstrators shoved riot troopers blocking the way asabout 15,000 people tried to march to the city center to denouncethe death of radical student Lee Chul-kyu, whose body was foundWednesday.   In Seoul, the government said today it has protested to the U.S.government for ``irresponsible remarks'' over Lee's death, which itsaid were made publicly Friday by a U.S. State Department officialin Washington.   Assistant Foreign Minister Lee Jung-bin said a U.S. officialtermed Lee's death a ``deplorable event and atrocious act'' andsaid ``we hope the murderers will be exposed and severly punished.''   The Foreign Ministry said it told the U.S. Embassy in Seoul thatthe remarks ``lack a sense of responsibility and could affect theinvestigation.'' The U.S. Embassy did not return telephone callsinquiring about the comments.   The crowd cheered as dissident leaders claimed policeinterrogators tortured Lee to death.   ``This barbarous act was committed by the suppressive securityforces to suppress the national democratic movement,'' claimeddissident leader Chang Ki-pyo.   Dissidents claiming a government probe is trying to cover up theincident are demanding a full and independent investigation intohis death and punishment of police officers allegedly involved.   Police have denied any official involvement in Lee's death.Doctors said an initial autopsy failed to determine the cause ofdeath.   Lee was being hunted by police for pro-North Korean articles andother political activities. He had spent almost two years in jailfor anti-government activities.   Lee's death could provoke widespread protests in Kwangju,especially since it came one week before the anniversary of a 1980anti-government uprising in the city in which at least 192 peopledied.   South Korea has been rocked by violent anti-government protestsand strikes in recent months, but radical groups have little publicsupport because of their violent tactics and extreme views. Roh hasordered a series of crackdowns to stop the dissident movement.</TEXT></DOC>
