Describing the frantic hours of Nov. 21, 1986, North testifiedWednesday that he witnessed his boss, national security adviserJohn Poindexter, rip a presidential finding in two. The findingretroactively legalized a CIA-assisted November 1985 weaponsshipment to Iran.   ``Did you ever think, `I'm in a den of thieves?''' prosecutorJohn Keker asked North, who was on the witness stand in hiscriminal trial for a fifth day.   ``No, Mr. Keker. ... I never regarded that I was working in aden of thieves,'' replied North. ``I honestly believed I wasworking for honorable men who were trying to do their level best... to make this country a better place.''   The same day that Poindexter tore up the finding, North'sex-boss, Robert McFarlane, reminded him to alter six memos to hideMcFarlane's and, North thought, Reagan's knowledge of North'ssecret assistance to the Contras. North made the alterations, ayear after McFarlane had first asked him to do so.   ``At any time on Nov. 21, 1986 did you think ... what you hadbeen asked to do might be wrong?'' said Keker.   ``No,'' North said, ``not for one fleeting moment.''   North said what McFarlane ``wanted removed from the documentswas language that would indicate his knowledge or the president'sknowledge about my activities in this time frame.''   The previous day, North, Poindexter, CIA director William Caseyand others went over proposed congressional testimony which deniedany U.S. knowledge of the November 1985 arms shipment to Iran until1986. North said nearly everyone at the meeting knew that to befalse.   A few days earlier, McFarlane had changed a chronology of theIran arms sales by omitting all references to the November 1985shipment, according to North.   North contended that the deception was necessary to protect thelives of U.S. hostages held in Iran. The Iranians were unhappy withthe Hawk missiles in the shipment sent through Israel anddisclosing the U.S. connection could result in retribution, Northtestified.   Told by Poindexter that the attorney general, at Reagan'srequest, was launching a fact-finding inquiry into the Iran armssales, North on Nov. 21, 1986, engaged in extensive documentshredding.   ``Did you begin destroying everything you could get your handson?'' Keker asked.   ``I left 80 boxes'' of documents behind, retorted North. ``I didnot try to destroy everything I could get my hands on.''   His former secretary, Fawn Hall, has testified that Northdestroyed more than a year's worth of computer messages that day.North testified that in the previous month, he started to ``cleanup'' at the request of CIA director William Casey.   North said he destroyed records tracking secret assistance tothe Contras and the diversion of funds to the rebels from the Iranarms sales. He also got rid of a ledger showing how he had spent$300,000 kept in his office safe. He now is accused of converting$4,300 of that money to his own use.   The finding Poindexter had torn up described the 1985 shipmentof Hawk missiles to Iran as a straight arms-for-hostages swap. TheDecember 1985 presidential finding authorizing it was a potentialpolitical disaster for a president who had vowed never to negotiatewith terrorists.   North said he had been placed in an impossible position.   Reagan's top advisers wouldn't allow the finding justifying the1985 Hawk shipment to become public because it ``was a politicalembarrassment,'' he said. ``They were leaving a heckuva pickle forthe people'' left behind to explain the arms transfer, whichwithout the finding was probably illegal.   North is accused of 12 criminal charges, including shredding andaltering documents in November 1986 and creating a false chronologyabout the November 1985 Hawk shipment.</TEXT></DOC>
