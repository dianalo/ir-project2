Under the plan, all creditors and health claimants would becomeshareholders in the Chicago-based steel-tubing maker, which stoppedmanufacturing asbestos pipe insulation in 1962.   The plan calls for business creditors to exchange their $112.7million in claims for 28 percent of the stock in the restructuredcompany, which will have equity in excess of $190 million,according to UNR attorney Malcolm Gaynor.   Personal-injury claimants would receive 64 percent of the commonstock of the restructured company and current shareholders wouldreceive 8 percent, Gaynor said.   Current shareholders also would receive the right to purchaseenough stock, at $5.15 per share, to double their holdings duringthe next six years, he said.   Asbestos, commonly used as an insulating material until theearly 1960s, can cause a range of respiratory ailments when itsfibers are inhaled.   Most of the health claims were filed by shipyard workers whosaid their contact with UNR's asbestos pipe insulation had causedthem to develop health problems, Gaynor said.   Stock earmarked for the claimants would be placed in a pool tobe divided among all current and future claimants, he said.   ``Out of that fund will come the cost of determining who it willgo to,'' Gaynor said. ``We're saying, `Here's a block of stock.It's your problem to divide it up at your expense.'''   He said the plan was endorsed by representatives of UNR'slargest creditors and the personal-injury claimants. Creditors andclaimants still must vote on the plan, although no date for thevote has been set, Gaynor said.   He said U.S. District Judge William J. Norton, thecourt-appointed examiner in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court case, alsohad endorsed the plan.   UNR filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. BankruptcyCode in 1982 after the cost of defending itself againstasbestos-related personal-injury claims contributed to asecond-quarter loss of $8.9 million.   UNR, a holding company consisting of Unarco Industries Inc., UNRInc. and UNR Products Inc., reported a profit of nearly $1.9million for the first quarter of 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
