The fine is the second largest OSHA has ever imposed against anindividual company. The only bigger fine _ $4.2 million _ waslevied against Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine, in November 1987,said OSHA spokesman Terry Mikelson.   Mikelson said inspectors and a specially hired expert inergonomics found a ``significant occurrence'' of repetitive motioninjuries among workers at the plant. The agency maintains that IBPcould have taken numerous steps to reduce the risk of suchinjuries, but did not.   OSHA Deputy Assistant Secretary Frank White said the injuriesare ``a major health hazard in one of the most dangerousoccupations in the country, and we want the meatpacking industry,in general, and IBP, in particular, to eliminate the problem.''   ``IBP has known about the high toll that these disorders havehad on its work force but has chosen not to deal with it,'' Whitesaid.   IBP, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Co., has 15 workingdays to contest the fine. The company already is contesting a $2.6million fine levied by OSHA last July for safety and recordviolations at the Dakota City plant.   In a statement issued late Wednesday, IBP officials said thecitation ``represents a misguided attempt by OSHA to force themeatpacking industry to blindly accept untested theories about theprevention of repetitive motion disorders.''   ``OSHA's goal is to intimidate companies by threatening enormouspenalties unless they accept Alice in Wonderland theories,'' thestatement said.   The company said that it has urged OSHA to develop a specialprogram for the meatpacking industry, but OSHA has not done that.   Al Zack, a spokesman for United Food and Commercial WorkersUnion, said he was pleased with OSHA's action and itsrecommendations for changes in working conditions at the plant.   ``There are very simple ways of preventing injuries,'' Zacksaid, ``and it's better to prevent the injuries than fining theemployer afterward. It would be far preferable if IBP would stopdenying there is a problem and start working on solutions.''   Mikelson of OSHA said the history of the latest fine dates backto November 1987, when safety inspectors from the agency ``noticeda pattern of repetitive motion injuries,'' a sometimes cripplinginjury caused by repeated hand, wrist and arm motion.   As a result of that finding, Mikelson said, OSHA expanded itsinspection to health-related issues and hired an expert inergonomics, David Cochran, of the University of Nebraska atLincoln, to do more extensive studies.   What the studies found, Mikelson said, was that 620 workers at45 work stations at the Dakota City plant were ``at grave risk'' ofdeveloping repetitive motion illnesses. Of those, 377 workersactually had developed the illness, Mikelson said. Some of thoserequired surgery to correct, some are on restricted work schedulesand some are on permanent disability leaves, he said.   The affected employees work on the production lines, doing suchwork as cutting, trimming, hide removal and lifting meat withhooks, Mikelson said.   OSHA maintains that IBP should have done such things as changingthe design of knives, educating workers about the need to changepositions periodically and slowing its production line.   ``Much of this particular situation is connected with a speedupof the production line,'' Mikelson said.   The $3.1 million fine represents a $5,000 penalty for each ofthe 620 workers. Mikelson estimated that a total of 3,000 peoplework at the Dakota City plant, one of 15 IBP plants.   OSHA began investigating IBP in the winter of 1986 afterreceiving a worker complaint about conditions at the Dakota Cityplant. A preliminary investigation showed that IBP's records showedan unusually low occurrence of worker injuries and illnesses,Mikelson said.   OSHA then launched a more extensive investigation, whichresulted in the $2.6 million fine for under-reporting injuries andillnesses at the plant.   At the time when OSHA was beginning its first investigation, IBPand workers at the plant were engaged in a bitter lockout thatturned into a strike. The seven-month strike by the United Food andCommercial Workers Union ended last July.</TEXT></DOC>
