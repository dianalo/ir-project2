<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-40-1127 </DOCNO><TEXT>Hyperthermia interacts with plasma membrane and it can be hypothesizedthat some of the effects of heat may be mediated through known intracellularmessengers such as the calcium ion. To test this hypothesis, MH-7777cells were incubated in medium containing various relative concentrationsof Ca/sup ++/ and EGTA and then subjected to hyperthermia. Incubationof the cells from 30-min before hyperthermia till 1-hr after in low-calciummedium or in medium containing equivalent zero or negative concentrationof Ca/sup ++/, had little effect on cell survival, suggesting that amassive entry of extracellular Ca/sup ++/ is not involved in thermalcell death. However a longer pre-incubation ( andgt;90 min) in medium containingEGTA in excess of Ca/sup ++/, a condition believed to cause intracellularCa/sup ++/ depletion, produced a dramatic inhibition of thermal celldeath yielding a level of resistance close to that observed in thermotolerantcells. Interestingly, the EGTA pretreatment did not by itself induceHSP and, on the contrary, inhibited subsequent heat-induction of HSP.Thermotolerance triggering, however, appeared not affected by EGTA pretreatments.It is suggested that intracellular Ca/sup ++/ plays a key role in thetriggering by heat of cell death and HSP, but may not be involved inthe triggering of thermotolerance.</TEXT></DOC>
