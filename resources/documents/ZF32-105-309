 Aging staffers are also likely to be affected bywork-environment problems from using a Macintosh all day includingvision problems, back and knee maladies, carpal tunnel syndromeand so on.andP;  Macintosh managers should begin training andorientation programs now for all of their Macintosh staffregardless of age that address problems with which aging employeesmust cope.andP;  This focus on the older employee is a recent issue andApple is leading the way with its development of hardware andsoftware that are easily used by workers who suffer from decreasedvision, shorter memories and other ailments.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Product:   Apple Macintosh (Microcomputer) (Usage).andO;Topic:     AgedPersonnel ManagementSoftware DesignUser NeedsErgonomicsHuman Factors.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Computing issues of the graying '90sandM;Don CrabbandM;And now for something completely different.andP;  That phrase from &quot;Monty Python'sFlying Circus&quot; always cued the audience to change its mental gears.andP;  I usethe line because it's time for Mac managers to explore a set of issues thatwill change computing in this decade, issues that have little to do withcomputing hardware and software but concern the people who use our systems.andM;Aging work force.andP;  Unless you manage an unusual group of folks, you may havenoticed that your twentysomething staffers seem to have aged overnight.andO;Instead of a group of kids fresh out of college, eager to embrace newtechnologies and work all hours to master it, you likely have a heterogeneousworkgroup that has become older, wiser and a lot pickier about the technologyit uses.andM;This graying of your staff probably shows itself in ways that you aren'talways aware of but could pose management problems down the line.andP;  Now is agood time to consider the ramifications of an aging staff and what you can doabout it.andM;The first consideration is the one that most of us completely ignore: our ownaging vs.andP;  the growing complexity of the software we use.andP;  Can you rememberthe operating details of all the Mac software you use today the way you couldin 1984?andP;  Your memory for detail starts to slip as the years pile on.andO;Apparently, though, Mac developers all must be 18 years old because today'ssoftware is orders of magnitude more complex and detailed than it was in1984.andP;  That complexity may be the natural outgrowth of a more capablemachine, but it can cause big problems for Mac managers.andM;Older knowledge workers.andP;  OK, I hate the knowledge-worker moniker too, but itdoes sum up the kind of staff I'm talking about here.andP;  The simple truth isthat if you are being affected by your own slightly slipping memory andability to handle computer complexities, so is your staff.andP;  And if you havestaffers who are past 60 years old, the problem can get serious.andM;Before I start getting a million letters here, let me be clear about what Iam suggesting.andP;  I am not suggesting that Mac managers discriminate againsttheir aging staffers.andP;  Far from it.andP;  I am arguing that Mac managers take intoaccount the potential problems that aging might cause for Mac users who relyon their machines to get their jobs done.andP;  And memory loss is just one of thepeopleware factors I'm talking about here.andM;When you couple your aging staffers with the possible work-environmentproblems caused by using a Mac all day (VDT emissions; back, knee and neckproblems; reduced visual acuity; carpal tunnel syndrome; and scores ofothers), you have a first-class recipe for major trouble, both in terms oflost productivity and in justifiable lawsuits by a staff permanently impairedby its computing work.andM;Training: What a concept!andP;  To take these aging and environmental problemsinto account, I'm arguing for Mac managers to launch comprehensiveorientation and training programs now for their Mac staffers, whether theyare 20, 30, 40 or older.andP;  These programs will have to be innovative andintensive.andP;  A few videotapes just won't cut it.andM;You may want to hire a personnel consultant who has specific experience withthe issue of aging employees coping with the increasing technologicalcomplexity of their tools.andP;  Don't expect to buy some kind of prepackaged&quot;aging staffer&quot; training materials; they don't exist.andM;This doesn't mean that you should despair.andP;  Many responsible computer vendorshave seen this problem coming.andP;  Apple, in fact, has taken the lead here withsome programs and is working on software and hardware that works better whenusers have shorter memories, decreased vision, reduced hearing or ailmentssuch as carpal tunnel syndrome.andM;But for any of this to work, Mac managers really have to get in touch withtheir Mac staffers now and remember that these people are their mostimportant asset.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
