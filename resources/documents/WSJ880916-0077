Schellhardt (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> HUF </CO><IN> TNM </IN><DATELINE> DAYTON, Ohio  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Huffy Corp.'s familiar Raleigh bicycle brand became a casualty of the industry's current sales slump.    The company agreed to sell its loss-ridden Raleigh Cycle Co. of America unit to Derby International Corp. S.A. of Luxembourg for an undisclosed amount of cash and notes. The bicycle and juvenile products maker said it will take an after-tax charge of about $2.9 million in the third quarter to reflect the sale, and that the softer-than-expected bicycle market will trigger a sharp drop in income from continuing operations in the quarter.    Huffy's decision to sell the Raleigh unit, with its venerable brand name, reflects a belief that the operation wouldn't meet the company's long-term profit goals for quite a while. Raleigh bike sales, in particular, have been hurt by the industry sales slump that hit unexpectedly in the spring.    The Huffy move is a painful one because company officials believe they had overcome most of the ailing unit's problems before the current sales slide hit. Huffy had narrowed the unit's losses, sparked in large part by startup costs for Raleigh's Technium bike with its aluminum-bonded frame, and had expanded its network of bicycle dealers.    Huffy acquired the exclusive license to sell Raleigh bikes in the U.S. in 1982, figuring it could boost its market share in small bike shops, where Raleigh bikes primarily are marketed. Huffy sells its Huffy-brand bikes principally to mass merchandisers.    In an interview, Barry Ryan, Huffy's vice president, finance, said bicycle sales have been picking up faster than the company had expected. &quot;It looks like retailers have sold through their inventories,&quot; he said. If the order trend continues, the company plans to increase the production rate at its major bike manufacturing plant in Celina, Ohio, currently operating at only 50% of capacity.    Huffy plans to spend $10 million in its Huffy Bicycle operation over the next three years, because the company continues &quot;to remain very positive on the U.S. bicycle market,&quot; said Harry A. Shaw III, chairman and chief executive officer.    For the quarter, excluding Raleigh's projected operating loss of $1.4 million and the one-time charge, Huffy said it expects income from continuing operations of about $1.8 million, or 21 cents a share. All but $25,000 of that would reflect a one-time gain from the effects of last year's trade bill. A year earlier, Huffy had income from continuing operations of $2.8 million, or 32 cents a share. Sales are expected to slide to about $67 million from $76.2 million.    For the nine months, Huffy said it expects a slight drop in income from continuing operations to $8.6 million, or $1.02 a share, from $9 million, or $1.04 a share. Sales are expected to rise to $246 million from $238.7 million. The company expects to report results in mid-October.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Huffy shares closed at $14.125, up 75 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
