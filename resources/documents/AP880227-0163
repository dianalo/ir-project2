In just the first two months of the year, the pot has keptbubbling with bids for the likes of Sterling Drug, FederatedDepartment Stores and Stop andamp; Shop.   Brokers like these stories because they have enlivened what hasotherwise been a very sluggish and scared stock market in theaftermath of the crash last fall.   When one company in a given industry _ for example,Addison-Wesley in publishing _ receives a bid, other stocks withsimilar businesses tend to attract speculative buying.   But beyond the windfalls takeovers can produce for holders of anindividual stock, analysts see these deals as positive for theoverall market outlook.   For one thing, they say, the activity suggests that a fair-sizednumber of presumably sophisticated people view American stocks asattractively priced.   Furthermore, takeovers can have a sort of echo effect. When theholders of a company that is acquired get paid off, they are likelyto reinvest the proceeds in other stocks.   ``The takeover game is going like gangbusters,'' observed JayDonnaruma, an analyst at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y.``Apparently everyone wants to `make a deal' before the environmentin Washington changes and becomes less friendly.   ``The takeovers do create more money to go into stocks, andthat's a positive for the near future.''   Joseph Feshback, technical analyst at Prudential-BacheSecurities, cites takeovers as one reason why he thinks a dramaticrise in the stock market ``could occur any week now.''   ``This is the final year of an administration that has been veryaccommodating to takeovers,'' he says. ``If takeovers proceed at avery rapid pace, they will put a huge supply of liquidity into thesystem.   ``By my rough calculations, as much as $20 billion could beinjected back into the system this year. Most of this shouldeventually find a home in the equity market.''   Stocks struggled to make much headway in the past week. The DowJones average of 30 industrials edged up 8.62 to 2,023.21.   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained .74 to147.70; the American Stock Exchange market value index rose 4.07 to284.23; and the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-countermarket increased 6.28 to 363.40.   Volume on the Big Board averaged 191.09 million shares a day,against 160.98 million the week before.   The merits and demerits of takeovers, of course, have been hotlydebated for years. One question many observers are asking thesedays: How many American assets do we want to sell to foreigninvestors to help finance our habit of consuming beyond our means?   Nevertheless, it appears to be a fact of life at the moment thatthe depressed dollar in foreign exchange is attracting foreignbuyers to U.S. businesses.   Some see buying by corporations, either domestic or foreign, aspreferable to the formerly fashionable leveraged buyout, in whichbig investors used huge amounts of debt to acquire businesses.   However they are conducted, mergers and acquisitions tend toreduce the supply of stock available in the marketplace.   And if you take the simple Economics 1 view that prices ofstocks are determined by supply and demand, a shrinking supplybecomes a force working in favor of higher prices.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions Feb. 27-28</NOTE></DOC>
