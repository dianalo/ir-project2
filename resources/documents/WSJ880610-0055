Terms weren't disclosed.    Caterpillar said it will purchase about 1.2 million of its common shares for use in the acquisition. This will be in addition to the plan it announced last October to buy as many as one million of its shares.    The maker of construction equipment said Carter Machinery will become its first company-owned dealership and will operate as a Caterpillar subsidiary.    Caterpillar said it wants to buy the dealership because a Virginia law that will take effect July 1 doesn't allow heavy-equipment makers to determine who sells and services their products.    Caterpillar, which has about 101.4 million shares outstanding, said the purchase is expected to be completed by the end of June. The transaction is subject to U.S. Justice Department approval. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Caterpillar closed yesterday at $64, down 75 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
