The Academy of Television Arts andamp; Sciences said it will produce an animated special that will air on a yet-to-be determined Saturday morning early next year. The three major broadcast networks, as well as such cable outlets as The Disney Channel, plan to simultaneously broadcast the special. In addition, it will be televised on more than 300 independent stations, as well as on the Canadian Broadcasting Co.    The academy estimates that an audience of over 20 million youngsters between the ages of five and 11 may view the special.    Major underwriter for the untitled special is McDonald's Corp., which is contributing &quot;in excess of $1 million,&quot; according to an academy spokesman. Roy E. Disney, vice chairman of Walt Disney Co., is executive producer. </TEXT></DOC>
