Grumman, of Bethpage, N.Y., has performed development workon the systems under a $245 million contract since 1987.Following the development work, scheduled for completion thisyear, Grumman expected China to execute a production optionto have the systems delivered for installation by the Chinesein their F-8 II jet fighters. The program would have been thebiggest U.S. military sale to China.</LP><TEXT>   The contract's future became clouded last year after theBush administration suspended military sales to China afterthe Beijing government crushed that country's pro-democracymovement. Production of the hardware could have proceededunder the suspension although delivery of the systems wouldhave been withheld until the measure was lifted, according toa Defense Department spokesman.   In Washington, spokesmen at the Chinese embassy didn'treturn calls to comment on the decision to forego productionof the Grumman equipment.   For Grumman, the decision was the latest in a series ofblows to its military-aircraft business as defense spendingin this country takes its toll on the company's programs. AGrumman spokeswoman said the Chinese decision will add to thepressure for more layoffs. The spokeswoman said Grumman hasabout 180 employees working on the development phase of theChinese contract.   Under the production phase of the contract, Grumman wouldhave produced electronics packages for 55 F-8 II aircraftconsisting of fire-control systems made up of radar,computers, display and other gear. The systems were to bedelivered to China for installation on new planes atShengyang Aircraft Co.   The F-8 II is a single-seat, twin-engined interceptorbased on the Soviet MiG-21, Grumman said.   Grumman received the Chinese contract under the Reaganadministration's generally liberal policies toward China.Although Grumman was to supply equipment and services to theChinese, the Air Force was to be the official vendor underthe terms of a foreign military-sales arrangement with China.   When the Bush administration suspended military sales toChina in June, the U.S. also expelled 40 Chinese working onthe Grumman development program in Bethpage. Theadministration allowed the Chinese to return in October andsince then there have been about 24 Chinese nationals workingat Grumman, the company said.   The F-8 II systems work is the second Chinese projectGrumman has lost during the past year. U.S. restrictions onsales to China last year put an end to a Grumman programannounced in 1988 in which the company was to conduct apreliminary study with China on upgrading the Chinese F-7Mfighter aircraft for sale in international markets. The studywas to determine the feasibility of an improved aircraft thatcould be sold for approximately $10 million each.</TEXT></DOC>
