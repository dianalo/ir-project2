SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The disease AIDS could claim 50 million livesthroughout the world in the 1990s, exceeding the toll of the BlackPlague in the Middle Ages, according to the World Future Society.   The AIDs prediction was the grimmest of scores of forecasts bythe society in the November-December edition of its magazine, TheFuturist. It said millions of Americans may become ill with AIDS,at an economic cost to the nation of $66 billion, even though thedisease, whose chief victims have been homosexual men andintravenous drug users, is not likely to spread rapidly within theheterosexual population.   The World Health Organization estimates that as many as 10million people worldwide may be infected with AIDS, with 1 millionnew cases possible by 1993. As of Oct. 10, AIDS had been diagnosedin 75,437 Americans, of whom more than half, or 42,432, have diedsince June 1, 1981, according to the Centers for Disease Control.No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.   On the positive side, the World Future Society foresees betterliving conditions both at home and on the job. Technology will helpmore Americans live in dream houses, with home theaters,housekeeping robots and backyard edens, it said. It predictedemployers will offer more family-oriented benefits, includingon-site child care, flexible working hours and time off to care forsick children.   The predictions summarize a wide range of reports publishedduring the past year by the society, a nonprofit educational groupbased in Bethesda, Md., which encourages research into issuesaffecting the future.   It predicted a continued rebirth of inner cities, with a trendtoward more greenery in downtown areas and an interspersing ofentertainment and cultural facilities, such as art museums andaquariums, within shopping areas.   The society said the AIDS epidemic could have some positiveeffects if it leads to national health insurance systems andpromotes a boom in medical research that could benefit all areas ofhealth care.

Japanesecontrol of the most advanced semiconductor technology by the 1990scould further erode U.S. economic strength.   _Computer networks and telecommunications facilities, includingthose operated by the military, will become popular targets forterrorists.   _Businesses will need to provide continuous employee training asthe automation and computer revolutions eliminate many low-literacyjobs.   _Fraud may become the crime of choice in the future as Americagrows older, replacing burglary, which requires the agility ofyouth.   _New discoveries in biotechnology and generic engineering couldlead to the replacement of nerve cells, arteries, hormone-producingcells and even brain cells. Artificial implants will become morecommon.   _If current trends continue, the United States will face ashortage of 1.2 million nurses by the year 2000.</TEXT></DOC>
