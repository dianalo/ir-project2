Paul Alcorn,co-pastor of the Bedford, N.Y., Presbyterian Church in which thecouple were married.   Alcorn says that most couples now want the wedding ceremony toreflect their personal histories. In this instance, the groom'sbrother _ an ordained minister _ officiated in the service withAlcorn, and the congregation was asked to consent verbally to theunion. Then anyone who wished to could speak about the couple, apart of the ceremony known as sharing time.   The wedding also was typical because one partner had beendivorced, says Alcorn. ``A significant proportion of couples comefrom a background of divorce.''   Some other trends noted by Alcorn and others: Premaritalcounseling is taken much more seriously. Alcorn says couples are``very interested in interpersonal dynamics,'' and ministers arelikely to initiate discussions on how relationships succeed andfail.   ``More couples are opting for a more traditional type of servicethan five to eight years ago, but with contemporary nonsexistlanguage. They avoid masculine-only gender pronouns and the theesand thous. It's not just the father of the bride giving daughtersaway. In 95 percent of the services, both families give theirblessing,'' says the pastor. He says he found the same thing truein prior pastorates in Neenah, Wis., and suburban Chicago.   Rabbi Daniel Syme, author of the book, ``The Jewish Home'' andvice president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations in NewYork, finds that Jewish couples in the Reform tradition ``are muchmore interested in knowing the meaning of the ceremony and thesymbols that will be part of that ceremony, as opposed to passiveparticipation in a ceremony which is not understood.''   Interest in restoring traditional ceremonies but updating themto reflect a more equal role for women also is an important trend,he said. In Jewish ceremonies, it's common for both sets of parentsto join the couple under the wedding canopy, or chupa.   Other ways in which tradition is returning include the use of aJewish marriage document in Hebrew and Arabic, known as a ketuba.However, the ketuba (the word comes from the Hebrew word meaning``written'') has been recast to reflect the equality of the sexesin the marriage covenant, says Syme.   Among a growing number of Reform Jewish couples, the groom wearsa yarmulke, or skullcap, and makes similar caps available to allmen in the temple. Reform Judaism eliminated the requirement forthe headgear many years ago.   Donning the skullcap signifies both the re-embracing oftradition and the fact that many of those now affiliated withReform congregations came from more traditional homes. ``For themthe yarmulke is an important symbol,'' says Syme.   ``It is customary now for the couples getting married in theCatholic faith to enter more into the planning of their wedding,''says Bishop Patrick V. Ahern, Vicar of Staten Island. N.Y., andpastor of the Church of the Blessed Sacrament there.   ``In the old days, it was a fully developed ceremony which theyaccepted and didn't modify,'' according to Ahern, who has been apriest for 45 years. The changes introduced by the Vatican Council15 years ago make it easier for couples to exercise some choices.   ``Couples are delighted to have that opportunity to participate.They get a pamphlet listing options and in most cases go over itvery carefully,'' says Ahern. ``Often they design very beautifulceremonies for themselves, selecting the readings from scriptureand using certain permissible options.'' He says a favored Biblicalreading is the section on love in First Corinthians. The Waiteschose this.   Many Catholic couples will opt for a candle-lighting ceremony.Each lights a taper and then together they light a third candle, tosymbolize the unifying sacrament of marriage and their equality asman and wife. They often turn to each other in exchanging consentvows, adds Ahern.   Rabbi Alex Goldman, author of the novel ``The Rabbi Is A Lady''and 12 other books and religious leader of Temple Beth El, aconservative temple in Stamford, Conn., reports that there has beena change in choices of ceremonial music of the wedding.   ``Gone almost completely are traditional military marches like`Here Comes The Bride.' Instead, music that has come out of Israeland is drawn from the Psalms or Solomon's Song of Songs ispreferred. This gives the ceremony a more romantic and more lovingcharacter.''</TEXT></DOC>
