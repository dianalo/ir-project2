Uranium in the ADU bearing material was cleared rapidly fromthe lungs, the retention kinetics being similar to a class D (highlytransportable) compound. Uranium in the U/sub 3/O/sub 8/ bearing materialwas removed from the lungs principally by mechanical processes, the retentionkinetics being similar to a class Y (poorly transportable) compound.For both materials the distribution of uranium amongst body tissues andthe fraction of the systemic content excreted in urine were similar tothose obtained after the injection of soluble hexavalent compounds. Forworkers potentially exposed to both these materials, urine monitoringand lung radioactivity counting measurements should be used in additionto air sampling procedures for assessing the intake of uranium. Intakesof the ADU bearing material should be restricted to those permitted forshort-term exposures on the basis of chemical toxicity, whereas thosefor the U/sub 3/O/sub 8/ bearing material should be governed by radiationdose.</TEXT></DOC>
