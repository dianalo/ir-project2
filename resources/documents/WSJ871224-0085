A significant number of industries -- including paper, textiles and plastics -- are operating at more than 85% of capacity. &quot;They slashed their capacity so much in order to reduce costs that the improvements in trade are now stretching their production capacity,&quot; says Jerry Jasinowski, National Association of Manufacturers economist. Many non-durable goods industries are operating at a higher capacity than the peaks of the 1970s, says Mickey Levy, chief economist at Fidelity Bank in Philadelphia.    If the trend continues, there is &quot;a good possibility&quot; that by the end of 1988 there will be inflationary bottlenecks and lengthening delivery dates, says Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. But others say it is too early to worry. Citing the impact of the Oct. 19 stock-market crash, economist Morris Cohen says the problem will be &quot;pretty much confined&quot; to export industries.    Capital spending should rise, but not for new plants, says Mr. Jasinowski. Companies could expand too much &quot;just as the economy is turning down.&quot;    TURKEYS AND HAMS still reign at the Christmas table.    But the holiday fixings this year reflect a trend toward more convenience. Some 65% of customers at Scotty's Grocery in Miami are buying oven-ready Christmas meals this year, up from under 40% five years ago. At Zabar's in New York, precooked foods are &quot;the biggest thing now.&quot; The roast goose with currant glaze is the yuletide best seller at Gelson's Markets in Encino, Calif., but side dishes like cornbread stuffing and scalloped yams also are in demand.    The trend toward health-conscious eating has some people buying low-salt hams, but most stores say such worries take a vacation at Christmas. &quot;Around the holidays you can forget about low salt and everything else,&quot; says Bill Colucci of Gristede Bros. in Manhattan. &quot;On the first of the year, they go back to dieting and low salt.&quot; But freshness remains a concern. At Vons Cos., Southern California's biggest grocery chain, people are buying fresh turkeys instead of frozen ones and opting for non-traditional fresh vegetables such as asparagus.    LIABILITY LAWSUITS affect U.S. competitiveness, companies say.    State-of-the-art products that would help the U.S. regain its competitive footing aren't going forward for fear of liability suits, say 57% of the 101 senior corporate executives surveyed by consultant Egon Zehnder International. &quot;I sense that reluctance,&quot; says Patrick McCartan, head of litigation at the Cleveland law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis andamp; Pogue. Technology &quot;is being frustrated to a certain extent by our tort system,&quot; he says.    Such a survey can't quantify the damage done, notes Marshall Shapo, a professor at Northwestern University School of Law. Still, some 20% of those surveyed could recall a product introduction that their company had forgone to avoid possible lawsuits. That may not be all bad. Over half of those surveyed said their company had increased research and development spending on product safety, and a similar number cited new safety features.    Who's to blame? Greedy lawyers, say 52% of those surveyed. An additional 47% blame consumer activists.    NEW YORK DINING costs more. The price of a single meal, one drink and tip averaged $63 at the 20 most expensive Big Apple restaurants, says the 1988 Zagat Survey. That compares with $45 in Los Angeles, $44 in Boston and $43 in Washington, D.C.    APPLICATION ANXIETY? Pennsylvania State University installs a new computer that allows students in 10 test high schools to check on the status of their applications. If deemed successful, the system may eventually allow students to apply from their home computer.    CORPORATE BOARD TURNOVER rose 77% this year, says management consultant Strategic Personnel Services Inc. Some 62% of the 1,924 companies studied lost at least one director, compared with only 35% in 1986. The firm calls this a &quot;delayed reaction&quot; to 1986's legal liability concerns.    COMPUTER PUBLICATIONS see good times after a big shakeout.    The advertising market for computer publications went up 17% this year, says Axel Leblois of IDG Communications Inc. in Framingham, Mass. The reason: Personal computers, which are more heavily advertised than larger models, are grabbing a bigger share of the market. IDG this year increased its publications world-wide to 92 from 70. Other computer publications also report being fat and happy.    That's quite a change from two years ago when computer publications were dying like flies. Some 86 defunct publications were listed in a recent Hill andamp; Knowlton Inc. internal memo designed to help staff members clean up their mailing lists. The survivors have taken a more corporate focus, targeting multi-unit buyers instead of the home user. Areas of computer-publication growth: networks, the Macintosh, desktop publishing and corporate computer buyers.    Flux remains so great that Cambridge Communications this year began tracking 60 trade publications as a service for public-relations firms.
