About halfof the patients showed blood levels of PB distributed in therapeuticrange, some of which were very cross to toxic range. None of the bloodsamples except one, however, was in therapeutic range in regard to DPH.There was some degree of correlation between blood levels of these twodrugs (r = 0.53). Absolute doses of PB and blood levels showed linearrelationship, while DPH was curvelinear in shape in regard to dosebloodlevel relation, suggestive of MichaelisMenten pharmacokinetics. Takingaccount of blood levels of these two drugs in the present study, phenobarbitalmust be responsible for untoward effects of HIDANTOL-F as well as anticonvulsiveeffect. Synergistic effect and mutual influences over pharmacokineticsof PB and DPH were discussed. Ratio of several drugs in case of combinationtherapy should be determined on the basis of study on pharmacokineticsand interaction of drugs.</TEXT></DOC>
