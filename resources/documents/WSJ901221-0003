Karr   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>12/21/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A7D</SO><CO>   X LABOR</CO><IN>OIL, SECONDARY (OIS)STEEL MANUFACTURERS (STL)PETROLEUM (PET)</IN><GV>LABOR DEPARTMENT (LBR)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- USX Corp. agreed to pay fines of $3.3million to settle charges of workplace health and safetyviolations at its Fairless Hills, Pa., steel mill and itsClairton, Pa., coke works.   The settlement was the largest in the history of the LaborDepartment's Occupational Safety and Health Administration,far exceeding the $1.6 million that Chrysler Corp. agreed topay in April 1988.</LP><TEXT>   But the USX amount was scaled down sharply from the $7.3million in fines OSHA had proposed in November 1989. Besidesagreeing to the fines, USX pledged to end violations relatedto hearing-impairment, electricity, communications withworkers about hazards, crane operation, and recordkeeping atthe Fairless and Clairton facilities. The company also agreedto undertake corporatewide programs for abating those healthand safety hazards.   USX agreed to the settlement without admitting guilt as tothe allegations.   &quot;There are other provisions of this settlement agreementfar more important to worker safety and health than thepenalties,&quot; said Gerard Scannell, assistant secretary oflabor for OSHA.   OSHA had said three workers have died at the Fairless andClairton plants in the previous two years and 17 have diedsince 1972. The agency charged that USX managers knew aboutmany safety deficiencies at the plants for years and failedto take action to counteract them. OSHA also said USX didn'tproperly record injuries at the Fairless plant despitepledging to do so in April 1987.   In addition to extending the safety effort to other plantsin Pennsylvania, Illinois and Alabama, USX's USS steelmakingdivision promised to meet with the Indiana state officials toseek a similar agreement covering the Gary, Ind., steelplant. Indiana runs its own OSHA-approved occupational safetyand health program.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,USX closed at $30.50 a share, unchanged.   The company agreed to the settlement partly to avoid longand costly litigation, said Thomas Sterling, vice president,employee relations, for USS. But he said the company has&quot;many areas of substantial disagreement over the OSHAallegations.&quot; He said the Fairless and Clairton works are&quot;safe plants,&quot; and the USS division has set &quot;a superb safetyrecord.&quot;   The settlement was backed by United Steelworkers ofAmerica Locals 1557 and 4889, which represent workers at thetwo plants. While applauding the fines, the union said theagreement confirms its contention that USX &quot;willfully allowedthe safety and health conditions in its facilities todeteriorate to such a point that workers were in seriousdanger.&quot;   The company continues to refuse to give the union reportsthat it sent to OSHA describing its plans for correcting theviolations, the Steelworkers said. That signals &quot;more battlesover safety and health at a time when other steel companieshave joined with the union in a variety of safety-relatedprograms,&quot; the union said.   Responding to the union allegation, the USS division saidit and the union have safety committees at various plants,which it said work together cooperatively and effectively.   The USX fines don't reflect new maximum penalties forworkplace health and safety violations. Set by Congress inthe recently enacted budget law, those fines can be as muchas seven times earlier maximums; they provide for penaltiesof as much as $70,000 for each &quot;willful&quot; violation.   The new schedule will be applied to violations occuring onor after Nov. 5, 1990, the effective date of the legislation,and involving OSHA inspections begun after March 1, 1991.   ---   Clare Ansberry in Pittsburgh contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
