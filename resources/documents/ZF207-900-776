 IBM estimates it will take three to five years toimplement the complete AD/Cycle program.andM;Prior to the announcement, IBM was able to sign more than 30 independentvendors to marketing and/or development agreements to ensure that myriadapplications will be available when the AD/Cycle products start trickling outnext year.andM;Three of those vendors, Bachman Information Systems Inc. and Index TechnologyCorp., both of Cambridge Mass., and KnowledgeWare Inc., Atlanta, garneredspecial status by selling technology incorporated in the initial AD/Cyclefamily.andM;Just before the unveiling, IBM acquired a 5% stake in each of the companies,which some observers say will force them to concentrate development resourcesmore on SAA-compatibility.andM;Index maintains that the IBM investment and agreement will not affectlong-term development plans.andP;  &quot;IBM has 5% of the company--that is a veryminor percentage of stock in the corporation,&quot; said Chris Grejtak, seniorvice president of sales and marketing.andP;  &quot;IBM is not deflecting us off ourcourse.&quot;andM;Grejtak maintains that Index will continue its joint marketing arrangementwith Digital Equipment Corp., which calls for supporting the DEC CDD Plusrepository product.andM;KnowledgeWare expects its agreement to give it a head start in sellingsoftware for AD/Cycle.andP;  &quot;We're doing a joint development that makes uscompatible to [AD/Cycle] faster than anybody,&quot; claims Executive VicePresident Donald Addington.andM;PRODUCTS OUT NEXT YEARandM;Though no products will be available until next year--the first version ofthe Repository is due in June 1990--the AD/Cycle introduction is described byInternational Data Corp., a market research firm based in Framingham, Mass.,andO;as &quot;among the most important software announcements ever&quot; made by IBM.andM;The key product, called Repository Manager, is described by Earl Wheeler,vice president and general manager of the IBM programming systems operation,as &quot;a foundation for integrating information and function.andP;  It is a singlepoint of control for sharing and exchanging information across the lifecycle.&quot;andM;The initial version of the Repository Manager will run under MVS/ESA andMVS/XA with future versions promised for VM and OS/400.andM;The AD/Cycle family also includes IBM-developed and third-party tools for usein the software development life cycle.andM;In addition, IBM is setting up onsite planning, project management, trainingand other service operations that are scheduled to be available from IBMpersonnel and subcontractors.andM;Many Case industry participants claim AD/Cycle represents an IBM endorsementfor Case.andP;  Participants believe this will open up a market that has grownmuch slower than predicted several years ago.andM;&quot;STATEMENT OF DIRECTION&quot;andM;&quot;The most significant thing is the statement of direction,&quot; said MichaelLyons, president of Asysts Technologies Inc., Naperville, Ill., which hassigned an agreement to port its Developer and Integrator Case tools to theRepository.andM;Lyons said the IBM offerings &quot;will force a de facto standard on the industry.andO;The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and theInternational Organization for Standards (ISO) have gone a long way towardsolving the standards issue, but AD/Cycle will become the standard.&quot;andM;He maintains that while the IBM offerings do not fully comply with thespecifications set by the standards group, &quot;IBM has drawn a line in the sandand NIST and ISO will have to adjust.&quot;andM;On-Line Software International Inc., Fort Lee, N.J., went so far as to dropits CasePac data dictionary product [Software Magazine, October] that wasunveiled with great fanfare after its acquisition last year from Fireman'sFund Insurance Co., San Rafael, Calif.andM;&quot;We want to position our company and product line to add value to AD/Cycle,&quot;said On-Line Senior Vice President Richard Ward.andP;  &quot;It wasn't a difficultdecision because if you look at the Case market, nobody has really made ityet.&quot;andM;On-line has installed that $200,000 CasePac offering at about eight sitesthat will continue to be supported, although the integrated product will beunbundled to support the IBM Repository product.andM;&quot;We don't feel we were successful in marketing CasePac because people wereanticipating the Repository,&quot; Ward said.andP;  &quot;But even beyond that, I don'tthink people know how to address Case.&quot;andM;On-Line is one of the few major Case vendors not to sign a formal agreementwith IBM, which is looking to get as many venors as possible to supportAD/Cycle.andP;  &quot;We would have loved to have been on the VIP list,&quot;  Ward said.andO;&quot;We believe we weren't there because we were seen as having a competitiveproduct.&quot;andM;According to IBM executives, having a competitive offering will not preventvendors from having joint marketing agreements for the AD/Cycle line.andM;&quot;IBM will offer seminars on AD/Cycle platform for all [Case vendors] who areinterested,&quot; said Wheeler.andP;  &quot;We expect many of those who attend will committheir products to this open platform.&quot;andM;FORCING CONFORMITYandM;Sam Albert, president of Sam Albert Associates, a White Plains, N.Y.,andO;consulting firm, and a former IBM executive, noted that &quot;IBM wants the entiresoftware industry to embrace what they are doing with AD/Cycle and SAA.andP;  IBMis trying to get the world of software developers to use SAA as a de factostandard.&quot;andM;Some vendors, including Computer Associates International Inc., Garden City,N.Y., do not see an advantage in signing an agreement with IBM to supportAD/Cycle.andP;  In fact, Wheeler acknowledged that CAI rejected an opportunity tosign an agreement to support the new Case product line.andM;&quot;The announcement is nothing new,&quot; contends Sanjay Kumar, executive vicepresident of CAI.andP;  &quot;You still have to buy DB2 to get all the benefits.andP;  Youhave to rewrite a lot of stuff and you have to retrain your people.&quot;andM;Kumar said CAI, as a vendor of mainframe database management systems, is notgoing to formally pledge support to an IBM strategy it sees as an attempt topush DB2.andP;  &quot;The strategy is clear, 'Buy DB2.'&quot;andM;However, he did say that by supporting SQL, the CAI CA-Datacon/DB DBMS willsupport the DBM Repository Manager product.andM;The Dylakor Division of Sterling Software Inc., Canoga Park, Calif., hassigned an agreement.andP;  But it does not expect to offer anything different thanthe bridge between its Presentation/Answer and Mark IX Case tools andproducts from CAI, Cincom Systems Inc., Cincinnati, and other vendors, saidCarole Morton, division president.andM;INDIRECT SUPPORTandM;&quot;Our intent is to support [the Repository] indirectly,&quot; Morton said.andP;  &quot;Wewon't develop a link, just a bridge to access information from it.andP;  Wealready have a bridge to DB2, now we'll have the same thing with theRepository.&quot;andM;McDonnell Douglas Systems Integration Co., St. Louis, has signed an agreementto support AD/Cycle, but it &quot;retains to ability to integrate with a varietyof repositories,&quot; said Karen Gedera, director and general manager of thecompany's information systems business unit.andM;She said that supporting AD/Cycle represents a long-term strategy, noting,&quot;Our own repository is much more comprehensive than IBM's.&quot;andM;IBM has even signed up application software vendors that don't develop Caseproducts.andM;&quot;This is a statement of direction, said Paul DiBono, marketing vice presidentat American Software Inc., an Atlanta-based developer of mainframe and AS/400financial and planning applications.andP;  &quot;Basically, what we're saying is thatwe're buying into this direction.&quot;andM;In addition, DiBono notes, American Software plans to utilize AD/Cycle toolsin its development operation.andM;In an overview of the announcement, IDC analyst Peter Burris notes that byclaiming the product line is open, IBM means that AD/Cycle is SAA-complaint.andO;The &quot;framework will likely not be implemented on powerful, low-costmicroprocessor-based repository servers.&quot;andM;The companies that have so far formally pledged support for AD/Cycle includethe major competition for IBM in the repository arena--KnowledgeWare andTexas Instruments Inc., Dallas.andM;TI WILL COMPETE WITH IBMandM;While TI officials say the Information Engineering Facility &quot;will comply withIBM's AD/Cycle framework,&quot; they acknowledge that the full life cycle offeringwill also be very competitive with the IBM offerings.andM;&quot;Obviously, everybody would like to be closer to IBM,&quot; said Eldon Patterson,director of IEF research and development.andP;  Patterson noted that under the TIpact with IBM, his engineers get to study the IBM Case offerings six to ninemonths before they are shipped to users.andM;However, Patterson admits, &quot;Make no mistake about it, we are competitors withIBM.&quot;andP;  Patterson notes that the TI repository first shipped in 1985, and that&quot;We know more about that area than anyone on earth.&quot;andM;The long list of vendors to sign agreements supporting AD/Cycle was describedas &quot;a masterful job&quot; by IBM, according to John Burton, COO of BusinessSoftware Technology Inc., Westborough, Mass.andP;  BST has signed an agreement tointegrate its Endevor products with AD/Cycle.andM;Burton maintains the agreements can benefit both IBM and independent vendors.andO;IBM benefits by getting applications, and the independents by gaining earlyaccess to technology.andP;  However, he notes, &quot;the differentiation&quot; of productsis up to the vendor.andM;Several second-tier vendors--those without the close relationship of Bachman,Index and KnowledgeWARE--fear that the IBM strategy may hurt them in the longrun.andM;In addition, executives of companies holding enabling agreements withIBM--joint development pacts that the companies cannot confirmexist--complain that IBM has lumped their companies with others that haveonly agreed to support the product line.andM;LIPS ARE SEALEDandM;An official at one of those second-tier vendors, who spoke on the conditionof anonymity, said that IBM may have signed 20 or so vendors tonon-disclosure joint development pacts to &quot;effectively neutralize [thosecompanies] in the marketplace.&quot;andM;Each of those firms must spend many development dollars on applications forAD/Cycle that cannot be disclosed according to the contract.andP;  Meanwhile, IBMis pushing products from companies like Index and KnowledgWare, which arealready market leaders.andP;  IBM's hardware competitors argue that AD/Cyclecapabilities have been available for years on their platforms.andM;&quot;With our Linc applications environment, we already offer a lot of thecapabilities of [AD/Cycle],&quot; said Eileen Berger, programming vice presidentin the Unisys Corp. office of technology.andP;  &quot;So IBM has endorsed a directionwe are already on.&quot;andM;Though the Linc Case products already include a repository, Unisys will addsupport for Repository Manager, Berger said.andM;Digital Equipment Corp., which markets the CDD Plus repository, promises tosupport AD/Cycle but won't elaborate until more details emerge from IBM.andM;&quot;We will support it, but we don't think it should drive our strategy,&quot; saidWilliam Keating, vice president of the software systems engineering group.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
