One reason given is that joint U.S.-Bolivian drug enforcement inthe field has become so effective that traffickers now are turningto bribing officials to win the release of those arrested.   Jorge Alderrete, Interior Ministry undersecretary for drugenforcement, and other Bolivian authorities said in interviews theysuspect drug traffickers might help finance some campaigns,including the one for president.   ``Drug related corruption has become endemic in certain lawenforcement circles, and drug traffickers will no doubt try toinfluence the elections,'' Alderrete said.   Congressman Fernando Salazar said, ``Drug traffickers offerfinancing, and this provides the base for political campaigns thatmust spend large sums on television advertising.''   Bolivians will vote for a successor to President Victor PazEstenssoro as well as a new Congress. With substantial U.S.assistance, Paz Estenssoro's 3-year-old conservative government haswaged a firm but uphill battle against a cocaine industry that reapsan estimated $500 million in yearly profits.   According to Bolivian officials, accounts of corruption abound ina web of complicity among traffickers, policemen, soldiers and courtofficials.   In September, police caught an alleged trafficker, Carmelo Nunezdel Prado, in a pickup truck they say was loaded with 1,125 poundsof coca paste in the Chapare region. U.S. Drug EnforcementAdministration agents working in Bolivia describe Nunez del Prado asone of the country's biggest dealers in paste, which is made frommashed coca leaves and is refined into cocaine.   After the arrest, Alderrete said, an associate of Nunez del Pradooffered the national police force's anti-drug commander, Col.Nicolas Anaya, $50,000 in return for the suspect's release. Anayarefused the bribe, the undersecretary added.   But after Nunez del Prado was jailed in city of Cochabamba, ittook police 20 days to pass the case to the district attorney whennormally it takes two to three days. The original police report wasaltered and after a 10-minute hearing District Attorney Nora Vasquezde Montoya released him for lack of evidence.   The suspected trafficker has vanished. Mrs. Vasquez de Montoyawas jailed but later released. Interior Minister Juan Carlos Duransaid she faces charges of receiving a bribe.   ``I have strong evidence that the $50,000 was paid to thedistrict attorney and a police adviser,'' Alderrete said.   Cochabamba, in the eastern foothills of the Andes, is consideredthe gateway to the Chapare, a jungle area the size of New Jerseywhere 80 percent of the country's coca is grown. Several police andmilitary officials assigned to the area are alleged to have providedprotection to traffickers in return for payments of $10,000 to$15,000 a week.   Gen. Gustavo Arrazola, chief of the army's biggest regiment, andfour other officers were dishonorably discharged in October. Theywere accused by the government of protecting a clandestine airstripfrom which 7,900 pounds of coca paste worth at least $10 million wassmuggled over a three-month period.   Authorities claim some poorly paid policemen seek assignments inthe Chapare, even though living conditions are difficult. Manyofficers leave the region as rich men after even a brief assignment,the officials say.   When a private loan institution collapsed in La Paz last year,among the list of people who lost their deposits were 17 Bolivianpolicemen, including a top drug-enforcement officer. Each had theequivalent of $100,000 to $150,000 in the bank, according togovernment records.   Alderrete said he often tries to change police assignments todiscourage corruption.   In addition, according to Interior Minister Duran, an increasedU.S. presence since 1986, including 30 U.S. drug enforcement andborder patrol agents who often work with local police, has madebribery of Bolivian officers more difficult.   The U.S. assistance is helping stem some of the drug productionand smuggling. In October, Bolivian anti-drug police and U.S. agentsraided and destroyed a record 12 major cocaine processinglaboratories in the jungle.   Duran said two men arrested at one of the labs, the biggest everto be discovered, testified that they worked for the fugitivetrafficker Jorge Roca Suarez.   The two workers were taken to the city of Trinidad, considered amajor international drug smuggling center, where authorities beganpreparing charges against Roca Suarez. There, according to Duran,five lawyers hired by the trafficker offered money and property to aTrinidad district attorney in return for her help. The districtattorney rejected the offer, but was told her refusal to cooperatewould jeopardize her children. She resigned from the case.   A new district attorney, Jorge Palma Sandoval, took over andthrew out the testimony of the two workers. He accepted thetestimony of a new witness who said the ranch were the lab was foundbelonged to him, and that chemicals at the site were used fortanning leather. The case against Roca Suarez was dropped.   Palma Sandoval is being removed from his post while authoritiesinvestigate his action in the case, Duran said.   Duran also said that as U.S.-backed raids have increased, thebribery of court officials is rising.   ``Since we have become much more effective at interdiction,traffickers are now corrupting the judicial system and making uswaste time arresting traffickers who later will be released by thecourts,'' Duran added in an interview.   In a bid to stifle the corruption, a tough anti-drug law passedin August calls for setting up special three-judge panels dedicatedexclusively to handling drug cases. The theory is three judges willbe tougher to suborn than one.   Despite the bleak picture, Duran said, the corruption problem canbe controlled.   ``Without a doubt, one of the evils of our time is corruption ofthe police, courts and elections,'' he said. ``It is not fair tosay, however, that everybody is corrupt, although few cases make itappear as if it were widespread.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wed PMs Nov. 30</NOTE></DOC>
