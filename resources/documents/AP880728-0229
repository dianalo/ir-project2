The agency, reporting the meeting between Sheik Zayed Bin SultanAl-Nahyan and cartel Secretary-General Subroto, quoted the U.A.E.president as saying his country ``has always been at the forefrontfor boosting OPEC decisions and supporting the stability of the oilmarket.''   The report did not specifically address the controversial issueof U.A.E. oil production, but it indicated the emirates would notundermine the 13-nation cartel by adopting unilateral decisions.   Sheik Zayed's statements were made after Subroto gave him amessage from OEPC President Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, according tothe WAM report. Details of the message were not disclosed.   The meeting was also attended by Mana Saeed Otaiba, the federalU.A.E. oil minister. Subroto and Otaiba met earlier as oil sourcessaid the OPEC secretary-general sought a compromise regarding theU.A.E. claim for a higher oil production quota.   WAM said only that Subroto discussed with Otaiba the ``latestdevelopments in the world oil market.''   The sources, who spoke on condition they not be named, saidSubroto's visit came in response to reports quoting U.A.E. oilofficials as saying the country would abandon its OPEC productionquota of 948,000 barrels of oil a day and produce about 1.5 millionbarrels a day.   They noted OPEC's price monitoring committee will meet Aug. 3 inLausanne, Switzerland, to discuss the oil market situation in lightof Iran's decision to accept a U.N. Security Council resolutioncalling for a cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war.   The war has been casting shadows on the cartel's efforts to curbproduction levels and maintain an $18 per barrel benchmark price.Both Iraq and Iran are prominent OPEC members and have beenflouting production and pricing policies, respectively, because ofthe conflict.   The U.A.E. demand for a higher quota is also a prominent issuefor the Lausanne meeting of the five-member pricing committee whichcomprises the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Algeria,Nigeria and Indonesia.   Otaiba has said the U.A.E.'s current quota was not fair and didnot synchronize with its production potential, claimed to be 4million barrels per day.</TEXT></DOC>
