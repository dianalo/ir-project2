Triangle Microwave is an East Hanover, N.J., maker of microwave parts.    The maker of swimming pools and electronic products said each Triangle share will be converted into the right to receive $6.50 in cash and a contingent payment unit issued by KDI. Triangle has about 5.5 million shares outstanding, about 30% of which are held by management.    KDI said holders of the contingent payment units will be entitled to all Triangle's pre-depreciation gross profits that exceed pre-determined levels between 1987 and 1991. Triangle estimated that its pre-depreciation profit in 1986 was about $6.7 million.    KDI said the merger requires government and Triangle shareholder approvals.    Triangle's shares closed at $6.25, unchanged, in national over-the-counter trading yesterday. KDI's stock rose 87.5 cents to $15.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
