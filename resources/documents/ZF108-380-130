 It practically guarantees that you'll get ugly-lookingtext on-screen.andP;  This is because the System grabs the bit-mapped font closestin size and scales it to suit.andP;  Adobe Type Manager (ATM) can save the day byproviding a smooth and accurate screen version of any properly installedfont, any time, any size -- if you treat it right.andM;The reasons for installing ATM vary from wanting screen WYSIWYG for a fewfonts, to printing smooth text on non-PostScript printers, to demanding anaccurate preview of fancy multifont typographic effects at immense pointsizes.andP;  This guide presumes that your needs fall somewhere between theseextremes.andP;  For almost any setup, my initial suggestions is to have at least 2megabytes of RAM, or you'll pay in speed, frustration, and even crashes --it's not ATM's fault that its task demands working space.andM;When you select a typeface, size, and style, ATM first tries to use anavailable bit-mapped version of the font.andP;  This works only if it can findexactly the size and style you've requested.andP;  If no such bit map exists, ATMbuilds the screen font from the mathematically defined outlines found inprinter fonts.andP;  These outline fonts are normally sent to (or reside in) aPostScript printer and enable it to do smooth scaling when it prints text.andO;Whenever ATM can't find the appropriate outline font, you get scaledbit-mapped text, as if ATM weren't there at all.andM;If you run into trouble with ATM, chances are that it's not installedproperly.andP;  In addition, many Macintosh users aren't accustomed to handlingoutline fonts, which are normally built in to their PostScript printers.andO;Figure 1 shows you which ATM elements to place where and illustrates yourchoices installing fonts so that ATM can find them.andP;  You should also heed thewell-written ATM manual.andM;Installing FontsandM;On the ATM disk, the Bitmapped Fonts folder contains the screen fonts.andP;  Ifyou install them into your System file, be sure to use version 3.8 or laterof Font/DA Mover.andP;  If you use Suitcase or MasterJuggler, put the screen fontsinto your usual font folder.andP;  Whatever your approach, you need to install atleast the 10- and 12-point sizes of each font.andP;  For optimum screenreadability of each style, install the plain, bold, italic, and bold-italicversions of each typeface.andP;  Even if you already have a Helvetica font, you'llwant to replace it with the version that comes with ATM -- it's much morereadable.andM;If you expect to work occasionally with ATM turned off and you still wantgood-looking large type, don't remove the larger size of screen fonts youalready have.andP;  If you frequently use type that's smaller than 10 points andyou have the appropriate font sizes, keep them installed also.andP;  They'll lookmuch better than those that ATM constructs, because it just doesn't do aswell with teensy screen type.andM;If you need to bypass ATM but still want good-looking screen text, check outFontSizer from Specialty Software Development (Austin, Texas).andP;  If you have aLaserWriter, this utility can build large screen fonts using the printer'sinternal processor.andP;  The resulting bit-mapped fonts can be installed in thesame way as any other screen font.andP;  With ATM off, however, you won't be ableto print high-resolution text on non-PostScript printers unless they employsome other font-scaling technology.andM;Now for the font outlines.andP;  You can put these in one of two places, dependingon where you've installed the corresponding screen fonts.andP;  If you usedFont/DA Mover to add the screen fonts to your System file, put the individualfont outlines into your System Folder.andP;  If you used Suitcase orMasterJuggler, put the outlines into the folder that contains the screenfonts.andM;Note that several outline files relate to each family -- for example, theTimes family includes TimesRom, TimesBol, TimesIta, and TimesBolIta.andP;  Theseoutlines represent the various weights and styles, such as bold, italic, andbold-italic.andP;  For the truest on-screen representation of what you'll get inprint, install all these outlines.andP;  If you leave out TimesIta, ATM may printthe true italic version (if it's built in to your printer), but it willdisplay a cheap imitation on-screen -- a slanted version of the plain font.andO;This pseudoitalic will also appear in print if that style isn't built in toyour printer.andP;  The difference isn't too glaring with Helvetica, but with mosttypefaces it's like night and day (see Figure 2).andM;If you install fonts from the Adobe Plus Pack, you'll see a folder labeledAFM Files.andP;  Ignore it -- the information that it contains is alreadyavailable from the bit-mapped font resource.andM;Finally, if you own fonts from other developers, make sure they're Type 1(Adobe-compatible) PostScript fonts.andP;  These are the only ones that ATM canrecognize properly.andP;  A few type vendors -- such as Bitstream, Monotype, andthe Font Company (URW typefaces) -- now supply their fonts  in Type 1 format.andO;Most other companies provide their typefaces in the more common Type 3format, and all fonts created with Fontographer are Type 3.andP;  Type 3 fontsprint just fine, but because ATM can't use their outlines for screen display,you'll get the usual jaggies and lumps from scaled bit maps.andP;  Chances are, ifyou've owned some non-Adobe type for a year or more, it's the wrong stuff forATM.andM;The Font CacheandM;If ATM seems to be slowing down operations such as popping into Word's pagepreview or zooming in a graphics program, you probably need to give it moreworking space.andP;  When ATM creates screen fonts, it temporarily stores thecharacters in a reserved area of RAM called the Font Cache.andP;  When the cacheoverflows, the currently undisplayed characters are deleted and replaced bynewly built ones.andP;  When you scroll to a part of your document that containsdeleted cached fonts.andP;  ATM patiently rebuilds them.andP;  This purge/rebuild cyclealways takes noticeable time, and you'll blame ATM for slowing you down.andO;Note that even if you simply zoom in or out, as with a page-layout or drawingprogram, ATM will create new font sizes to give you smoothly magnified orreduced characters in each view.andM;To give your system back its old zip, use the Control Panel DA to access theATM cdev and then set the Font Cache to 256K or more -- sometimes far more.andO;A large enough cache will pay off in zero waiting time whenever you scroll orzoom.andP;  You should pump up the cache appropriately whenever you use a largesizes or many different sizes or if you routinely zoom to several levels.andO;Keep in mind that the first time you zoom or use a new font/size/style, ATMwill need extra time to build the properly sized screen font.andP;  If you feelconsistent system sloth and have the RAM to spare, don't be stingy -- boostthe Font Cache until your working speed feels normal.andP;  To make more RAM spacefor ATM's Font Cache, you can turn off or reduce the size of your RAM Cachein the General cdev (see Figure 3), turn off some INITs, or temporarily forgorunning under MultiFinder.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
