SPARC processor anda Weitek Corp. 3171 floating point processor.andP;  Up to four processors can beinstalled within a single system cabinet.andM;The five-family series is available in a range of configurations.andP;  Users maypurchase the Series5/500 desktop workstations, the Series5/600 desksideworkstations, the Series5/530 work group servers, the Series5/670departmental servers and the Series5/800 Superservers.andM;The new systems incorporate 128 kilobytes of physical cache memory, animprovement over the Series4's 64KB of virtual cache memory.andP;  The physicalcache allows each processor to work with identical data addresses, whereaswith the virtual cache memory, data addresses could be different in differentprocessors.andM;An enhanced version of Solbourne's multiprocessing, SunOS-based 4.01operating system also plays a role in the systems' increased functionality,the company says.andP;  Solbourne's version 4.0A OS/MP operating systems adds aset of administration tools for easier system and network management andconfiguration, Solbourne says.andP;  Enhanced X Window capabilities enable usersto send messages via a new UNIX mail utility called Smail.andP;  In addition, anew Sproperty utility provides information regarding a window's size,position and attributes as it appears on display.andM;The 500 models have five slots for the company's proprietary Kbus expansioncards and can house up to two Cypress CPUs.andP;  The 600 and 800 models provideroom for up to four CPUs with both a seven-slot Kbus or seven-slot VMEbusdesign.andP;  Performance levels range from 22 to 65 million instructions persecond, and memory extends from 16 to 160 megabytes.andP;  Maximum storagecapacity extends from 2.6 to 13.3 gigabytes.andP;  Prices start at $33,400 for theone-CPU 5/531 server up to $172,600 for the four-CPU 5/804 server.andP;  The newmachines are available this month.andP;  SOLBOURNE COMPUTER INC., Longmonth, Colo.andM;ATpT Adds FourandM;386-Based PCsandM;ATandamp;T Computer Systems has unveiled four 386-based systems meant for use bysmall to large work groups in distributed networked environments.andM;The four new 16- to 33-megahertz 6386 Workgroup Systems (WGS) can beconfigured in a variety of ways to function as desktop systems, servers ormultiuser systems.andP;  The WGS models 6386/SX, 6386/25, 6386E/33 and the6386E/33 model S are all IBM PC AT-compatible computers.andP;  They will runeither the MS-DOS release 3.3, OS/2 release 1.1 or UNIX system V/386 release3.2.2 operating systems, with the exception of the 6386E/33 model S, whichruns only the UNIX system V/386 operating system.andP;  Memory capacities rangefrom 2 to 16 megabytes of random access memory on the low-end system up to atotal of 40MB of RAM on the 6386E/33 model S.andM;ATandamp;T says the systems are intended to be connected to a company's mainframes,minicomputers and personal computers over networks such as ATandamp;T's StarLAN,StarLAN 10 or Ethernet.andP;  The systems' video and floppy disk controllers,keyboard, mouse and hard disk interfaces are built into the motherboard,which leaves between four and 10 standard expansion slots so that users canadd boards for networking or enhanced communications.andM;Users can choose from an optional selection of peripherals, boards, operatingsystems and specific application software packages.andP;  The WorkGroup Systemsare available now in the United States; in Canada, they will be available inthe fourth quarter of 1989; and they are slated to be available in Europeearly in 1990.andM;Pricing starts at $2,995 for a 6386/SX model with a single floppy unit to$24,725 for a server version of the 6386E/33 model S.andP;  ATandamp;T COMPUTER SYSTEMS,Morristown, N.J.andM;NEC Upgrades ItsandM;PowerMate PCsandM;NEC Information Systems Inc. has upgraded its PowerMate personal computerfamily with three models.andM;The new machines--the PowerMate 286,286 Plus and SX Plus--are designed forbusiness users needing a variety of applications ranging from generalbusiness uses to computer-aided design (CAD) and graphics-oriented desktoppublishing.andP;  These PowerMates replace NEC's PowerMate 1, PowerMate 1 Plus andthe PowerMate SX versions.andM;The new PowerMate 286 is intended for use as a low-end desktop machine.andP;  Themachine processes date at 8 or 10 megahertz and comes with 512 kilobytes ofrandom access memory.andP;  At a suggested retail price of $1,299, the 286 comesstandard with a 1.2-megabyte floppy drive and the MS-DOS 3.3 operatingsystem.andP;  The $1,999 286 Plus steps up the power and features, running MS-DOS3.3 and the OS/2 operating system as standard, with processing speeds of 8 or12MHz; 1 MB of RAM; and a 1.2MB, 5-1/4-inch floppy disk drive.andP;  The SX Plusmodel, a 386-based system, includes 2MB of RAM and a 1.2MB, 5-1/4-inch floppydisk drive.andP;  This SX version operates at 8 or 16MHz and features MS-DOS 3.3and NEC's enhanced OS/2 operating systems, as well as GW BASIC 3.2programming language and Microsoft Windows/286 software.andP;
