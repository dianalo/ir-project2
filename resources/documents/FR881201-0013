Numericallycontrolled machine tools and dimensional inspection machines are controlledunder Export Control Commodity Number (ECCN) 1091A on the CCL.This document correctly amends paragraph (b) of ECCN 1091A to clarify codificationproblems arising from publication of ``Removal of Validated License Controlson Jig Grinders Exported to Country Groups QWY'' (53 FR 7733, Mar. 10,1988) and ``Amendments to the Commodity Control List Based on CoordinatingCommittee Review'' (53 FR 18271, May 23, 1988). The March 1988 regulationsredesignated paragraph (b)(ii) as paragraph (b)(iii), added a new paragraph(b)(ii), and revised the newly redesignated paragraph (b)(iii introductorytext. The May 1988 regulations incorrectly revised paragraph (b)(ii), whichhad been redesignated as (b)(iii), and incorrectly added a paragraph (b)(iii),which already existed. The May 1988 regulations should have revised paragraph(b)(iii) and added a new paragraph (b)(iv). This document, rather thancorrecting the amendatory language and codification of the May 1988 regulations,correctly revises paragraphs (b) (ii) and (iii) and adds paragraph (b)(iv)for the convenience of the reader.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>December 1, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Larry Hall, Office of Technologyand Policy Analysis, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, Telephone:(202) 377-8550.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements</ITAG>1. Because this rule concerns a foreign and military affairs function ofthe United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the meaning ofsection 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirementsof that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final Regulatory Impact Analysishas to be or will be prepared.2. This rule does not contain a collection of information subject to therequirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>).3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility has to be or will beprepared.5. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), as amended(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EAA does notrequire that this rule be published in proposed form because this ruledoes not impose a new control. Further, no other law requires that a noticeof proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given forthis rule.Accordingly, this rule is being issued in final form. However, as withother Department of Commerce rules, comments from the public are alwayswelcome. Comments should be submitted to: Joan Maguire, Office of Technologyand Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of Commerce,P.O.
