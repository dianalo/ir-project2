The ban against Kyokuto (Far East) Shokai, based in Tokyo, stemmed from the company's conviction last month in a district court and will begin Friday, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI, said.    MITI said the export ban on Kyokuto Shokai applies to all goods and to all countries with which the company does business.    The Tokyo District Court last month fined the company two million yen ($16,290) for exporting a total of 138 electronic-measuring machines and digital memory chips to China between September 1982 and June 1986 without obtaining government permission. Two company officials were sentenced to as long as one year's imprisonment for their involvement.    The equipment was among 178 strategic items restricted by the government under the rules of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, a Paris-based watchdog body on trade with communist bloc countries, including China. </TEXT></DOC>
