ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ronald H. Brown, telling Democrats ``you havemade history,'' was elected chairman of his party Friday, becomingthe first black to head a major political party. He immediatelyurged Americans to ``set labels aside.''   ``My chairmanship will not be about race; it will be about theraces we win over the next four years,'' he told cheering members ofthe Democratic National Committee.   The former aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and adviser to JesseJackson outdistanced four opponents in recent weeks and wasunopposed Friday as he won election to a four-year term at the helmof a party that is struggling to reverse a string of defeats inpresidential elections.   ``I couldn't be prouder,'' said outgoing chairman Paul G. KirkJr. as he handed the gavel to Brown.   Democratic Party officials, who had openly feared that Brown'sbid for the chairmanship would split the party along racial lines,stood and cheered.   ``He's his own man,'' said Florida Democratic chairman CharlesWhitehead, who nominated Brown for chairman.   When the campaign to succeed Kirk began, Whitehead and most otherSouthern party leaders were looking for an alternative to Brown.There also was opposition among some Jewish Democrats concernedabout his involvement with Jackson.   Six leaders of major Jewish organizations circulated a letterthey sent to Brown ``welcoming your election'' and saying ``we areconfident that you bring to this critical post the same commitmentand effectiveness in achieving unity that you demonstrated duringthe recent campaign.''   ``There is no need to dwell on, but we cannot ignore, the historyof this moment,'' Brown said after his election.   ``In choosing the first American of African descent to lead oneof America's major political parties, you have made history.''   Then, in a wry reference to the early opposition to hiscandidacy, Brown said, ``I know some people are wondering just whatkind of history we've made.''   ``Let me speak frankly,'' he went on ``I did not run on the basisof race, but I will not run away from it. I am proud of who I am andI am proud of this party, for we are truly America's last, best hopeto bridge the divisions of race and region and religion andethnicity.''   He recalled John F. Kennedy's need to overcome opposition toelecting a Catholic as president and said, ``I ask America to do asyou have done _ I ask America to set labels aside _ and I knowAmerica will do so.''   As the nation approaches the 1990 Census, which will require aredrawing of congressional and state legislative district lines toreflect population shifts, Brown said the goal was to win 600 morelegislative seats for the Democrats.   State legislatures have a key role in drawing the new districtlines and both major parties are devoting resources to legislativeelections between now and 1991.   But, said Brown, the political contest over the next four years``will not be one about tactics, but one about values. Given thatmatchup, I have nothing but confidence about the future.''   Democrats are painfully aware they have lost five of the last sixpresidential elections, four of them by landslide margins.   ``We need to chart a roadmap to the presidency,'' said Brown ``aroadmap that includes the South and the West.''   ``We need to say flat out: There is no one tougher than Democratswhen it comes to protecting our children from drugs, when it comesto protecting our cities against crime, and when it comes toprotecting our nation against terrorism and aggression,'' said thenew chairman.   The Democratic National Committee also elected Robert Farmer asparty treasurer.   Jack Otero, a vice president of the Transportation-CommunicationsInternational Union, was elected a vice chairman with responsibilityfor voter registration.   Other vice chairs elected were Lynn Cutler of the District ofColumbia, Carmen O. Perez of California and Mayor Lottie Shackelfordof Little Rock, Ark.</TEXT></DOC>
