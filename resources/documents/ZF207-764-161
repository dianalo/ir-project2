 400 on Reader Service CardandM;Like travelers trying to find their way without road maps, VMS users whoaren't familiar with DCL can have a hard time getting where they want to go.andO;If they've never used a computer before, or if they're more comfortable withmenu-driven, point-and-shoot systems, users can find the DCL promptintimidating.andM;Filemaster from Hancock Software is a file- and directory-management systemthat guides users through the DCL maze via menus and maps.andP;  With Filemaster,users can view their directory trees, examine file and directory attributesand statistics, and call up a comprehensive menu of commands with a singlekeystroke.andM;We reviewed version 1.0 of Filemaster, which can be used on all VAXes runningunder VMS version 4.4 or higher.andM;EASY GOINGandM;Filemaster places all of the information that users need to manage theirdirectories and files right at their disposal.andP;  When first invoked,Filemaster reads all of the user's files and directories.andP;  It then useswindows to organize the information visually; point-and-shoot menus giveusers a broad range of command options.andM;Like airport maps with their &quot;You Are Here&quot; markers.andP;  Filemaster presents amap of the user's directory tree in one of its windows and highlights thecurrent directory with its cursor.andP;  Another window lists the contents of thatdirectory, and a third offers information on the user's disk quota, thecurrent directory's size and the number of files the directory contains.andM;Users can press the slash key (/) for a complete list of command options.andP;  Ifan inappropriate response is entered at a menu prompt, Filemaster willrespond by providing examples of appropriate entries.andM;Because Filemaster is menu-based, users seldom need to consult its helpfacility.andP;  If they do get bogged down, however, they can press the PF2 key tocall up a context-sensitive help screen.andM;Although Filemaster is particularly helpful to new users, it can benefit evenexperienced users because it has features DCL doesn't offer.andP;  For example,users can get a listing of all their files--scattered across subdirectories,devices or even nodes--sorted by such criteria as file size or creation date.andM;The system also provides a kinder, gentler method for deleting files thandoes DCL's DELETE command.andP;  Its &quot;soft delete&quot; option moves files ordirectories into a holding directory, from which they can be easilyretrieved.andP;  System managers can schedule times for periodic purging of filesfrom those special directories.andP;  For more self-assured users, the &quot;harddelete&quot; option is just as final and irrevocable as DCL's DELETE.andM;Soft-deleted files ae renamed to a subdirectory specific to each user.andO;System managers must decide whether the subdirectories should all be togetheron one disk or be separated so each subdirectory is on the disk containingthat user's login directories.andM;If soft-deleted files are stored on a separate scratch disk, they will nolonger count against the user's allotted disk quota.andP;  However, if they arekept on the user's disk, they will take up space in the user's account untilthe files are permanently deleted.andM;System managers can customize Filemaster's command initialization file todefine special function keys and to disable menu items across the entiresystem.andP;  A systemwide environment file can define the layout of Filemaster'swindows, specify soft or hard delete as the default, specify the default texteditor and default print command, and determine how much directory and fileinformation Filemaster reads when it starts up or after it executes acommand.andM;Users can create their own command initialization and environment files tomodify any systemwide defaults.andM;WE DO WINDOWSandM;Users can start Filemaster by entering the command FLM at the DCL prompt, orthey can have the program start when they log in.andM;The first thing Filemaster does is read in the user's files and directories,Logical names can be used to exclude some directories from Filemaster'sdirectory tree or to define directory trees that span devices and nodes.andP;  (Toaccess a remote node, a Filemaster server program must be installed on thatnode.)andM;We tested Filemaster's multinode abilities by defining a logical name,TWONODES, that included the directory specifications of the two VAX nodes wewanted to access.andP;  By including the qualifier /ROOT=TWONODES with our FLMcommand, we caused FLM to read in our files and directories from both nodes.andM;After reading in this initial information, Filemaster presented us with itsfour-part opening screen (Fig.andP;  1).andM;At the top of the screen is the Control Panel, where Filemaster displays itscommand options menu.andP;  Below this on the left is the Main Window, displayingthe user's complete directory tree, and on the right is the Status Window,displaying statistics on that directory tree and on the user's currentdirectory.andP;  At the bottom of the screen is the Contents Window, whichdisplays a list of the files in the directory whose name is highlighted inthe Main Window's directory tree.andM;Filemaster displays its directory tree with the user's root directory at thetop of the Main Window and with subdirectories below and to the right oftheir parents.andM;Users can move through this tree using their terminal's arrow keys.andP;  With theUp-Arrow and Down-Arrow keys, users can move up and down through the entiretree; the Right-Arrow and Left-Arrow keys let users move between directorieson one level, bypassing intervening parent or children directories.andM;As users move through the tree, a cursor highlights the name of the directorybeing selected, and the Contents Window lists the files in that directory.andM;At the top of the Status Window, Filemaster lists the user's current diskquota and the number of blocks available.andM;Below that information are statistics relating to the user's entire directorytree, including the number of directories and files in the tree, the numberof files that the user has &quot;marked&quot; (selected for a file managementoperation) and the number of disk blocks occupied by each of those groups.andM;At the bottom are the same statistics--number of directories and files,selected files, marked files and the number of disk blocks used for each--forthe directory whose name is currently highlighted in the Main Window.andM;Users can switch the Status Window to a Listing Mode that displays VMSattributes for the currently highlighted directory, including protection andownership information, as well as the date and time the directory was createdand last modified, for example.andM;The information displayed in the Main Window, Contents Window and StatusWindow changes according to the mode that the user selects.andM;Filemaster starts up in Directory Mode, in which users can select menu itemsto perform operations on directories--creating, deleting, copying and soforth.andM;To switch to File Mode, the user press andless;Returnandgt; or selects the Files optionfrom the Windows Menu (Fig.andP;  2).andP;  the Main Window replaces its directory treewith a listing of all files in the currently highlighted directory; theStatus Window changes to display statistics or attributes for the currentdirectory and file; and the Contents Window displays the contents of the filewhose name is highlighted in the Main Window.andP;  In File Mode, users canperform menu operations on files.andM;Two other modes--Undelete and Allfiles--are accessed from Filemaster'sWindows Menu.andP;  In both modes, the Current Window displays the contents of thecurrently highlighted file.andM;In Undelete Mode, the Main Window displays all files that have been &quot;softdeleted,&quot; and the Status Window displays the user's quota, statistics on thesoft-deleted files and statistics on the currently highlighted file.andM;In Allfiles Mode, users can access files in any of their directories asthough they were all located in the same directory.andP;  The Main Window displaysa list of all of the files in the user's entire directory tree while theStatus Window displays the user's quota as well as statistics on all filesand on the currently highlighted file.andM;When users press the slash (/) to call up Filemaster's Main Menu, they arepresented with a list of command options and a submenu of options availablefrom the currently highlighted Main Menu item.andM;Users can move through this menu to a desired option by using the arrow keys,or they can move directly to that option by pressing the slash (/), followedby the first letter of each menu item's name leading down to that option.andO;Thus, to access the Delete option in the File menu, for example, users couldpress /FD.andP;  Pressing andless;Controlandgt; C allows users to back out of Filemaster'smenus one level at a time.andM;In Directory Mode, the Main Menu consists of Windows, Select, Order, Mark,Unmark, Directory, Execute, Customize and Quit.andP;  In Files Mode, Directory isreplaced by File.andM;From the File Menu, users can perform the full panoply of VMS fileoperations.andP;  By selecting the Edit option, users can edit the contents oftheir text files using either EDT or TPU.andM;All operations that can be performed on individual files can also beperformed on multiple &quot;marked&quot; files.andP;  For example, if users want to copy agroup of files from one directory to another, they can mark each file to bemoved by pressing the Enter key to put an asterisk next to its name.andP;  Oncemarked, the files can be moved with a single command.andM;UNDELETE FEATUREandM;Users can select Undelete Mode or Allfiles Mode from the Windows Menu.andP;  InUndelete Mode, users can review files that have been soft-deleted and recoverthem or choose a &quot;kill&quot; option to delete them permanently (Fig.andP;  3).andM;Users should note that undeleted files are returned to the currently selecteddirectory, not to their original directories.andP;  If a group of files has beensoft-deleted accidentially, the user must recover them individually in orderto return them to their original directories.andM;Filemaster's Select Menu lets users specify criteria for selecting files,such as filename, file type, creation date and owner.andP;  Files can be selectedfrom across all subdirectories, devices and multiple nodes (if the rootdirectory has been defined to include the directory trees from more than onenode).andM;The Order Menu allows users to sort their files according to a wide varietyof criteria: by alphabetical order, by type, by size (used or allocated) andby the dates of the files' creation, modification, last backup or expiration.andO;By default, files appear in Name Ascending (alphabetical) order.andM;This is more than DCL allows.andP;  No DCL command exists for displaying files bytheir size, for example.andP;  Nor is there a command to sort files by date,though users can display just those files created before or after a givendate.andM;Users can also combine Select and Order options in Filemaster, selecting allfiles created before a certain date and ordering them by size, for example.andM;Hancock Software officials said that system managers can utilize Filemaster'ssort options to manage disk usage.andP;  For instance, system managers can displayall files on the system by size in order to determine which files are eatingup the most disk space.andM;Filemaster also makes it easier for system managers to manage access controllists (ACLs) by using the /File Set ACL menu option for file ACLs and the/Directory Set ACL option for directory ACLs.andM;Users can customize Filemaster's defaults to their own liking--changing thenumber of columns in the Main and Contents windows, for instance--and savethose settings in an environment file.andP;  Filemaster uses that file toestablish the user's default parameters the next time it is invoked.andM;To customize a single Filemaster session, users can append command linequalifiers to the FLM command that initiates the Filemaster program.andM;Unfortunately, version 1.0 doesnht allow system managers or users to addoptions to Filemaster's menus.andP;  (Hancock said it plans to introduce thatcapability in a future release.)andP;  It would be nice to create an Applicationsmenu item from which users could access VMS Mail or their favoritespreadsheet, for example.andM;Filemaster does provide two Execute menu options.andP;  One allows users to issuea single DCL command; the other lets users spawn a subprocess.andP;  Both thenreturn users to their Filemaster session.andP;  Users can also create a functionkey to invoke the Execute option.andM;One minor flaw in Filemaster is that users are confined to their owndirectories.andP;  To view another user's directory, a user must invoke theExecute menu option to access the DCL prompt, then enter a DCL command fromthere.andM;Filemaster uses the numeric keypad and the newer VT terminals' editing keypadto provide function keys so users can move through files and directoriesquickly.andP;  But its use of these keys is inconsistent.andP;  For example, pressing 7on the numeric keypad while in the Main Window brings the user to the bottomof that window, but in the Contents Window that same operation isaccomplished by pressing 4.andM;Users can create their own function keys by pressing PF3, then enteringFilemaster's DEFINE command.andP;  The Filemaster Reference Manual includes anindex of Filemaster commands, the program's basic building blocks.andP;  Advancedusers may occasionally want to work with these commands directly instead ofworking with the corresponding menu items or standard function keys.andM;Filemaster version 1.0 comes with a user's guide, a system manager's guideand a reference manual.andP;  All three volumes are professionally produced,well-written and easy-to-use.andP;  The Reference Manual includes a map showingthe location of Filemaster's function keys.andP;  Hancock software also providesan on-line tutorial that takes users through all the basic Filemasterfunctions.andM;Prices for Filemaster range from $495 for use on VAXstations to $7,950 foruse on VAX 8900-series systems.andM;Filemaster should be particularly attractive to organizations that have manynovice VMS users.andP;  Although most of Filemaster's capabilities can beduplicated via DCL commands, its ease of use and visual presentation of fileand directory information can make the VAX a much less frightening place toroam.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
