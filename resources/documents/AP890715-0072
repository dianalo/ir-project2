The National Union of Mineworkers said it will seek to arrange aconference no later than October to bring together the ``core forcesof the mass democratic movement.''   ``It is important to win over all anti-apartheid forces to ourside,'' said the union, which has about 300,000 members.   Anti-apartheid groups have been urgently trying to formulateunified strategies since the July 5 meeting between President P.W.Botha and jailed black nationalist Nelson Mandela, leader of theAfrican National Congress.   Opposition groups initially dismissed the talks as governmentpropaganda that involved no shift in policy. But severalorganizations revised their assessment and called it a positivedevelopment after Mandela released a statement Wednesday indicatinghe welcomed the chance to talk with Botha.   The mineworkers union said the Congress of South African TradeUnions _ the country's largest labor federation _ and the UnitedDemocratic Front _ the largest anti-apartheid coalition _ would playleading roles in the coalition it sought to establish.   However, both groups are banned from participating in politicalactivities.   The mineworkers did not explain how these organizations couldbecome active in politics.   The outlawed ANC and other anti-apartheid groups have said therecan be no negotiations with the government until it meets severalbasic demands, such as freeing all political prisoners, legalizingbanned organizations and lifting the state of emergency.   The anti-apartheid movement has found it increasingly difficultto organize under the 3-year-old state of emergency, during whichmore than 30 opposition groups have been banned.   Mandela has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a lifesentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government.   His meeting with Botha suggests the ANC leader is willing to talkwith the government, though his demand for a non-racial democracy inSouth Africa is unchanged.   The white-led government also appears to have eased its policy ofhaving no contact with the ANC, which it labels a terroristorganization.   Under South Africa's apartheid policies, the 28 million blackshave no voice in national affairs. The 5 million whites control thegovernment and economy, while maintaining separate neighborhoods,schools and health facilities.</TEXT></DOC>
