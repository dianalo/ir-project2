In this experiment, a rhizobox systemwas developed and/or improved for studying availability of nutrientsincluding heavy metals. This rhizobox has several soil compartments ofdifferent thickness (1, 2, 5 mm --). These compartments are separatedby nylon cloth. Two soil types were used and the effect of sewage sludgeapplication has been investigated. Barley seedlings grew well for 5 weeksand roots developed with high density in the central compartment. Thesolubility of metals was evaluated by double acid (H{sub 2}SO{sub 4}+ HCl). The results indicated that the roots increased the pH as muchas 2 units in the vicinity of roots. In most cases, the solubility ofthe heavy metals (Cu and Zn) decreased with increase in soil pH. Conversely,soluble Mn and Fe increased though there was a raise in pH in the rhizospherein sand soil. The application of sewage sludge influenced the pH levelat rhizosphere by changing NO{sub 3} and Ca level across the rhizosphere.</TEXT></DOC>
