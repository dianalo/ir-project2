Ross Perot, General Motors Corp. and GM directors, seeking to stop the buyout of Mr. Perot's GM Class E shares and the departure of several associates from EDS.    Milledge A. Hart III, a wealthy Dallas businessman who was among investors joining Mr. Perot in founding EDS in 1962, is listed as plaintiff in the suit, which seeks class-action status, and a derivative lawsuit. The suit was filed in New York state Supreme Court.    Mr. Hart, who was EDS's second president, owns 140,000 Class E shares. He is being represented by the New York law firm of Milberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie andamp; Lerach.    EDS was acquired by GM in 1984 for $2.55 billion.    Last week, an Illinois shareholder filed suit in federal court in Detroit, seeking to rescind the $742.8 million buyout. Mr. Perot said he wouldn't accept GM's money outright and instead would put it in escrow until Dec. 15. Securities lawyers say they expect several lawsuits to be filed in the wake of GM's action.    As a result of the buyout, Mr. Perot and three top associates are leaving active management of EDS.    Mr. Hart's suit asks the court to order the buyout rescinded and that damages be paid to GM by directors for alleged waste of corporate assets and breach of fiduciary duty. The suit also requests that damages be paid holders by directors for alleged breach of fiduciary duty.    In a derivative action, shareholders sue directors on behalf of the corporation. Typically, the shareholders in such a lawsuit argue that directors took a course of action harmful to the corporation.    The suit argues that the buyout of Mr. Perot's stake violates New York's public policy contract law forbidding the sale of a directorship. Normally holder lawsuits of this kind are filed in the state where the defendant's company is incorporated, in this case Delaware, or in federal court.    &quot;The carrying out of the transaction in order to buy Mr. Perot's silence and facilitate the resignation of other top executive officers of EDS violated the public policy of this state by discouraging directors from fulfilling their obligations to speak objectively and frankly, which is necessary to fulfill their fiduciary duties of loyalty, care and attention,&quot; the lawsuit stated.    Melvyn I. Weiss, an attorney for the plaintiff, requested that the court order accelerated discovery and deposition proceedings in the case since &quot;a long interruption in the leadership of EDS may be irreparable and will cause harsh damages to holders of GM Class E common stock as well as to the EDS employees.&quot; Class E shares don't represent an ownership position of GM or EDS. They give holders a right to dividends based on EDS profits. GM owns 100% of EDS.    Justice Walter Schackman ordered a hearing for 9:30 a.m. Friday in New York. </TEXT></DOC>
