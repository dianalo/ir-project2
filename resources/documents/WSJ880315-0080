But volume was lighter than in the upturns of recent weeks, traders said, and investors were picky.    &quot;Today there is no frenzy,&quot; one trader observed. Volume on Nasdaq slipped to 108 million shares, after averaging around 145 million for the past two weeks. But 45 million of those shares were purchased at higher prices yesterday, and only 25 million declined.    The Nasdaq Industrial Index rose 2.16 points to 389.21, almost in line with the gains in larger stocks as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Nasdaq 100 index of the largest OTC issues rose 2.64 points to 358.42.    The mixed caution and optimism among buyers yesterday was clearest in the computer and electronics issues. Bad news hurt some of those stocks, but a number of others rose sharply.    On the downward slope were stocks of dozens of makers of mid-range computers, workstations and related hardware. They were continuing to react to the announcement last week by Wang Laboratories that &quot;some slowing has been seen in the closing cycle for new business.&quot; Wang is traded on the American Stock Exchange.    Analysts responded to that news by commenting that sales slowdowns were likely for many makers of expensive mid-range computers because buyers are moving toward more powerful personal computers.    Among the largest OTC issues yesterday, Sun Microsystems -- which has some $1.1 billion in market value and makes high-performance workstations that tie to mid-range computers -- slipped 1 to 32 1/2. Wyse Technology, a $400 million concern that makes video display terminals and workstations, slid 3/4 to 20 1/2. Among smaller issues, Data Translation, a $30 million concern that makes high-performance data-acquisition products, fell 7/8 to 10 1/4.    Meanwhile, International Microelectronics, a $60 million electronics concern, slid on bad news of its own. The stock dropped 3/4 to 3 5/8 on news that the company expects net income and revenue in its third quarter, ending March 31, to be below second-quarter results because &quot;certain important customers&quot; had deferred their orders.    The company makes custom integrated circuits that mix analog and digital signals of the sort used in many medical instruments, along with complex digital circuits used in advanced computers.    Meanwhile, a number of electronics concerns that make circuits and other parts for personal computers surged on the news customers were switching to PCs from mid-range units. Intel, the OTC market's largest electronics concern, rose 1 3/4 to 32 1/4 and Micron Technology was up 1 5/8 to 21.    Chips andamp; Technologies climbed 1 1/4 to 19 3/4 yesterday. The stock was aided by a Wall Street Journal story last week that said Tandy Corp. is about to unveil a copy of International Business Machines' new Personal System/2 computer system, which may use a chip set that Chips andamp; Technologies makes.    Among biotechnology stocks, Aequitron Medical, a small OTC issue, slid 3/4 to 3 3/8 on an announcement that it initiated a safety alert to its dealers and intends to begin a modification program on heart-rate monitors that it makes for infants who are considered to be at risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.    Merger news affected some OTC stocks yesterday. Medco Containment, a big Nasdaq company that supplies low-cost drugs and supplies by mail, announced plans to merge with National Data, an OTC computer concern. National Data holders will get 2.3 Medco shares for each National Data share. National Data jumped 3 1/2 to 30 1/4, with 630,900 of its 11.7 million shares changing hands. Medco Containment slid 1 to 14 7/8, with 1.3 million of its shares trading yesterday.    In other merger news, Crown Auto rose 2 1/2 to 6 on the announcement that it has agreed to be acquired for $7 a share by a unit of Northern Pacific. </TEXT></DOC>
