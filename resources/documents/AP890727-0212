JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dirty air spread last year with 30 millionmore Americans living in areas where they breathed levels of airpollutants the government considers harmful, the EnvironmentalProtection Agency said Thursday.   The agency said the latest figures, which cover the recentthree-year period, mean that at least 101 areas will be required totake additional air pollution control measures under new clean airlegislation that is likely to emerge from Congress this year.   In all, about 110 million people _ better than four of every 10Americans _ were breathing air that at least during some summerdays in 1988 had smog levels considered to be unhealthful,according to the EPA figures. The year earlier the number was about80 million.   The EPA attributed the higher levels last year of ozone _ aprincipal component of smog _ largely to the fact that the countrysuffered through one of the hottest summers in half a century.Ozone is created when hydrocarbons, mainly from automobiles,combine with severe heat and dust.   All but two of the 37 new areas where ozone levels exceededfederal standards were east of the Mississippi where the 1988summer was particularly severe. In 44 areas the air also hadunhealthy levels of carbon monoxide, slightly fewer than previousyears.   Severe smog pollution can cause a variety of respiratoryailments including impaired breathing and chest pain, whilelong-term exposure can cause permanent lung tissue damage,according to medical experts.   While the unusually hot 1988 summer may have been largely toblame for the surge in air pollution, EPA officials said thestatistics reinforce the need for swift action in Congress onlegislation tightening air pollution controls.   ``This sharp increase in the number of areas not yet meeting theozone standard is dramatic proof of the pressing need for a newclean air bill,'' said EPA Administrator William Reilly.   ``The problem is immense. We must address it now,'' he said.   The 1988 figures will be used by the EPA in determining whataction a state will require of local communities to clean up theair under new federal air pollution laws being debated on CapitolHill.   William Rosenberg, EPA's associate administrator for air, saidthat while some of the targeted communities may again come intocompliance if the summer heat eases, most of the 101 geographicregions will have to impose additional pollution controls under theexpected clean air legislation.   President Bush in June proposed a sweeping revision of thefederal air pollution laws, including increased use of alternativemotor fuels in areas facing the most severe ozone and carbonmonoxide threat.   Environmentalists recently accused the administration of backingoff from some of the original proposal, a claim heatedly deniedThursday by Rosenberg who maintained that the proposed bill sent toCongress by the president would bring all but four of the 101georgraphic areas into compliance by the year 2000 and cost thepublic millions of dollars less than competing versions.   The administration's clean air legislation was introduced in theHouse Thursday night, with the chief sponsorship of House Energyand Commerce Committee Chairman John D. Dingell, D-Mich. and theranking Republican on the committee, Rep. Norman Lent of New York.   They were joined by 145 co-sponsors, including 89 Republicansand 56 Democrats.   Democrats have introduced their own clean air legislation, butRosenberg said he is confident a compromise can be worked out.   Under the administration proposal before Congress, the fourmetropolitan areas with the most severe pollution in 1988 _ the NewYork, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles areas _ would be required tophase in automobiles using alternative fuels as well take otherpollution control measures.   The four areas would be given 20 years to come into compliance.Chicago was added to the four after the final 1988 ozone figureswere tabulated, while the other three have for some time beenconsidered to have the nation's worst air pollution.   Another 27 cities are considered by the EPA to have ``serious''ozone pollution. Under the president's proposal they would have 10years to come into compliance by tightening auto emissioninspections, the use of alternative fuels in some cases, and curbson pollutants in some businesses such as bakeries and dry cleanersas well as in refueling cars at gas pumps.   These areas would be required to establish a program ofpollution control to reduce emissions by 3 percent a year untilthey attain compliance with the federal standard.   Ozone pollution in the remaining areas was described as moderateor marginal and would require less-severe action to correct,officials said.   The worsening pollution for ozone in 1988 was tempered somewhatby a net decrease in carbon monoxide pollution, although 44 areasstill exceeded those federal standards as well, the EPA said.</TEXT></DOC>
