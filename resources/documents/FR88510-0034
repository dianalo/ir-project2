L. 99-570, Title XII,100 Stat. 3207, 3207-170) was signed into law by the President. This supplementaryinformation section contains: background information on relevant provisionsof the Act and comments obtained from the ANPRM; a summary of the NAS study;and a discussion of the proposed rule and its relation to current out-of-servicerequirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Summary of the BAC Level Provisions of the ActSection 12008(f) of the Act requires the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary)to establish the BAC level, not to exceed 0.10 percent, at or above whicha person when operating a CMV shall be deemed to be driving under the influence(DUI) of alcohol and subject to the licensing sanctions described in theAct in section 12008 (discussed below). Failure to issue such a rule byOctober 27, 1988, will result in this level being set at 0.04 percent.Under section 12009(a)(3) of the Act, each State must adopt and enforcelaws consistent with the Federal requirement, and consistent with any out-of-serviceregulations issued by the Secretary under section 12008(d)(1) of the Act,in order to avoid having Federal-aid highway construction funds withheld.Also under section 12009, States must adopt disqualification provisionsfor CMV operators described in the Act. These disqualification provisionsbecame effective on July 1, 1987 (52 FR 20574), and are contained in andSection;383.51 of the FMCSRs (49 CFR 383.51). Disqualifications under the Act applyto operators of ``commercial motor vehicles'' as defined in the Act andoccur for offenses which were committed after July 1, 1987. Certain ofthese disqualifications, or licensing sanctions, would apply to CMV driverswho are ``deemed to be under the influence of alcohol.''Section 12008 of the Act provides that CMV operators who are found to havecommitted a first violation of driving a CMV under the influence of alcoholshall be disqualified for at least 1 year. For a CMV operator carryinghazardous materials, this disqualification shall be for at least 3 years.Any CMV operator found to have committed a second such offense (at anytime without regard to a time limit for the second offense) shall receivea lifetime disqualification or a disqualification for a period of not lessthan 10 years, as may be prescribed by the Secretary.The FHWA recognizes that the terms ``deemed to be under the influence''and other similar phrases are accepted terms of art in State statutes_particularlyState criminal statutes_and, as such, have important related criminal sanctionsand penalties for <T3>all</T3> drivers. Section 12009(b), however, provides that a Statemay satisfy the requirements of section 12009, in part, by implementinga commercial driver's licensing program which includes penalties and disqualificationsfor CMV drivers that result in license suspensions, revocations, or cancellations.In other words, the Act does not require that any other State sanctions,particularly criminal sanctions, apply to CMV drivers who violate the BAClevels established by this rule. The FHWA believes that States can meetthe intent of the Act by adopting standards which would result in CMV operatorsbeing disqualified from driving CMVs, i.e., subject to administrative sanctions,when they are found to have committed certain offenses. Therefore, theFHWA proposes to establish a series of licensing sanctions related to drivinga CMV while impaired by alcohol that would be separate from the administrativeand criminal penalties currently embodied in State law. These administrativesanctions would augment but not replace those criminal sanctions.In order to avoid a withholding of Federal-aid highway funds under section12011 of the Act, States would be required, pursuant to section 12009 ofthe Act, to adopt the BAC level proposed by the FHWA for purposes of disqualifyingdrivers from operating CMVs in accordance with andSection; 383.51 of theFMCSRs (52 FR 20574). These proposed administrative sanctions are not intendedto supersede or preempt the criminal or administrative penalties whicha State may invoke at established or other BAC levels.Section 391.15 of the FMCSRs also contains disqualification provisionsfor drivers of motor vehicles engaged in interstate or foreign commerceif they are convicted of certain offenses. Interstate drivers of motorvehicles with gross vehicle weight ratings of 10,001 pounds or more arecovered by andSection; 391.15. The disqualification provisions for driverswho are subject to andSection; 391.15 are administrative sanctions whichaugment currently used criminal sanctions.The requirement in the Act for the Secretary to commence rulemaking todetermine the appropriate BAC level by October 27, 1987, was fulfilledby publication of the ANPRM of March 23, 1987 (52 FR 9192). Also as requiredby the Act, the FHWA contracted with the NAS to conduct a study of theappropriateness of reducing the BAC level at or above which a person, whenoperating a CMV, is deemed to be driving while under the influence of alcoholfrom 0.10 to 0.04 percent. The findings of the NAS study and comments receivedon the ANPRM form the basis of this proposal and are discussed in the followingsections. Comments on the ANPRM The ANPRM solicited comments on the appropriate BAC level required to beestablished under the Act. In particular, detailed information and supportingdata for particular positions were sought and made available to the NASfor its study. A total of 31 responses were received. Of these, two favored retentionof 0.10 percent BAC as the appropriate level. Twenty-three favored a lowerlevel, including six who supported the 0.04 level specified in the legislationand 11 favored even lower levels. The remaining six did not state a preference.Of the six respondents that did not state a preference for a BAC levelfor the purpose of this Act, two, the Arizona Department of Public Safetyand the International Association of Chiefs of Police, favored a changeto Section 12008(f) of the Act. These two respondents believed that settingthe BAC level at 0.04 percent would create an apparent double standardbetween CMV drivers and other drivers. These respondents, thus favoreda legislative change to permit States to adopt administrative regulationswhich would allow them to place a CMV driver out-of-service with<T3> any</T3> measurable BAC level. Proposed changes to the Act itselfare beyond the scope of this rulemaking action. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) was among the six respondentsthat did not state a preference for a BAC level. The IBT was opposed, however,to a double standard. The IBT noted that alcohol related fatalities area larger problem on a national basis among other drivers than among CMVdrivers. It noted that the Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) dataindicate twice as many passenger car drivers with BAC levels above 0.10percent are involved in fatal accidents as all heavy truck fatal accidentswith or without alcohol involvement. The IBT favored the identificationof an appropriate BAC level at which a driver can reasonably be judgedto be driving under the influence, and which can be reasonably and fairlyenforced and applied by Federal regulation to all drivers. The authorityin the Act, however, is limited to operators of CMVs. This proposal doesnot, therefore, address BAC levels for non-CMV drivers. The problem of CMV drivers called to work on short notice is a concernof the IBT. The IBT urged that the FHWA incorporate a provision, as partof this regulation, which would prohibit an employer from discharging,disciplining, or discriminating against a driver who, when called for dispatch,informs the employer that he/she has consumed alcohol recently and maybe in violation of the established BAC level. Roadway Express, Inc., was also among the respondents who did not statea preference for a BAC level. Roadway Express stated that ``Congress recognizedthe inherent difficulty in identifying this level and correctly soughtassistance from those best able to provide it_the National Academy of Sciences.''Roadway Express called for a careful evaluation of costs and benefits ofthe suggestion to lower the BAC level to 0.04 percent, noting that difficultiesexist with the 2-hour call period which is common in the industry. Theynoted that costs are involved with the extension of the call period toprotect drivers who report consuming alcohol, and believe that some driverswould use an extended call period to avoid working at inconvenient times.Roadway Express also noted that current rules and practices have had goodresults in deterring driving while impaired, and that setting a FederalBAC level implies that levels below that are acceptable, a situation thatshould not in its view be encouraged. The American Trucking Associations, Inc. (ATA), was also among the respondentswho did not state a preference for a BAC level. It stated that the multipleconstraints of State laws, Federal regulations, company policy, and themanner in which violations can jeopardize a driver's livelihood have resultedin an environment in which the incidence of DUI of alcohol for CMV driversis much lower than the rest of the driving public. The ATA believes thatit is vitally important that no action be taken that will be interpretedby drivers as allowing them to consume alcoholic beverages, as long astheir BAC is below a designated level.Of the seven responses received from States, five expressed concern overenforcement issues relating to a BAC level less than 0.10 percent. Responsesincluded comments that it will add further confusion to a burdensome problem,will create an apparent double standard, and will be difficult to detectand enforce. However, all seven States favored a tightening of FederalBAC level requirements in one form or another.The Pennsylvania DOT, one of the two respondents that favored retentionof the 0.10 percent level, suggested extending the time prior to drivingin which alcohol consumption is not permitted from 4 to 8 hours. The CaliforniaHighway Patrol favored placing a driver out-of-service for a minimum of4 hours on evidence of alcohol consumption. As stated earlier, the Departmentof Public Safety expressed a somewhat similar position. The Michigan Departmentof State supports a level below 0.10 percent based on sound data as maybe developed by the NAS study. The Hawaii DOT Motor Vehicle Safety Officefavored a level of 0.04 percent or lower. The Ohio Department of PublicSafety took the position that any amount of alcohol in the system of aCMV driver is a cause for concern. The Colorado Department of Health favoreda zero alcohol policy for CMV operators at the time of driving as it believesthat such a position would avoid creation of confusion in what they perceiveis an overburdened judicial system.The Amalgamated Transit Union favored no reduction in legislated BAC levels.It noted that bus accident rates are low and stated that the proposed 0.04percent BAC level is neither scientifically nor statistically justifiable.Safety was the dominant issue for the 23 respondents supporting a lowerBAC standard. Comments included: a need exists to demand more stringentrequirements of CMV drivers; a double standard between commercial and non-commercialdrivers is acceptable as this was the intent of the Act, because thereis a greater potential for severe accidents with heavy vehicles; most deathsin accidents with these vehicles are suffered by other road users; theFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Federal Railroad Administration(FRA) have adopted 0.04 percent standards; and scientific evidence of impairmentat low BAC levels exists.The NAS Study<T3>Approach</T3>_This study was conducted by the Committee on the Benefitsand Costs of Alternate Federal Blood Alcohol Concentration Standards forCommercial Vehicle Operators. The committee was established by the NASfor the express purposes of producing the study mandated by the Act. Timeconstraints dictated that the study be largely limited to a critical reviewof existing literature. The study also included available findings fromother research studies underway, analyses using existing accident databases, and consultations with other professionals in the field. As partof the internal NAS review of the draft study report, a peer review wasconducted using experts outside the committee.<T3>Findings</T3>_Alcohol impairment related to the driving task has beenstudied through three different techniques; laboratory studies, closedcourse driving studies, and accident studies. Hundreds of laboratory studieshave examined at least one facet of driver related performance at one ormore BAC levels. The findings of such studies conducted at low BAC levelswere reviewed by the NAS panel. Response to an emergency driving situationrequires the ability to see the situation developing (visual performance);to recognize it (cognitive performance); to decide how to respond (cognitiveperformance); and to physically react e.g., brake or steer (motor response).Studies of visual performance have found glare response is degraded atBAC levels as low as 0.01 percent, and focus for depth perception is degradedat the 0.04-0.05 percent BAC level. In the area of cognitive performance,a study of single task and divided attention tasks at BACs of 0.06 and0.09 percent found performance degradation for the divided attention tasksbut not for single task performance. (In the driving situation, steeringis a single task and steering and avoiding crossing traffic is an exampleof a divided attention task.) A divided attention study conducted at BAClevels of 0.015, 0.03, 0.045, and 0.06 percent found a significant increasein errors at a BAC level at 0.015 percent compared to a zero BAC level,and that the error rate increased linearly with an increase in BAC level.Similar results were found in two other studies with BAC levels rangingfrom 0.23 to 0.089 percent.A motor response study at zero, 0.021, 0.050, and 0.073 percent BAC foundimprovement in simple reaction time with positive BAC; however, errorsin task performance were significant at all positive BAC levels, and increasedwith BAC.In summary, laboratory studies have shown significant degradation in thefirst three steps at low BAC levels, while the fourth step, reaction time,is unaffected or may even improve slightly.A closed course driving study found degraded performance at a mean testBAC level of 0.036 to 0.037 percent. (In this study more pylons were hit,greater stopping distances occurred, and there were more collisions witha dummy suddenly appearing in the path for drivers at these BAC levelsthan for drivers with zero BAC.) Emergency braking and steering in anotherclosed course driving study were found to be significantly degraded whendrivers were in a hangover condition, i.e., zero BAC, 8 hours after obtaininga mean BAC of 0.147 and allowed to sleep.The largest and perhaps most cited case-control accident study of alcoholimpairment is the Grand Rapids study discussed in the NAS report. Whenthe data from these 5,985 crashes are sorted by overall drinking habits,the risk of crash involvement is found to increase with BAC without evidenceof a threshold effect as shown in Figure 3-3 of NAS report. That is, riskincreases at any positive BAC. When the data are not controlled (sorted)by general drinking behavior or other important variables (age, sex, etc.),the picture is not so clear. In any case, accident studies still show arapid increase in responsibility for a crash at a BAC above about 0.04percent. Also, accident frequencies increase above a BAC of about 0.08.The NAS study noted factors affecting CMV drivers that may differ fromthe general driving population. Skilled drivers may be less affected atlow BAC levels than unskilled drivers in relatively routine driving tasks.However, even skilled drivers show a decrease in performance under thecomplex demands of a potential accident situation. Truck driving is muchmore demanding than car driving as indicated by such factors as: more informationdisplays (about 34 vs. 17 in a car); more vehicle controls (about 52 vs.33); greater braking distances required; overturn and jackknife risks notpresent in car driving; and certain heavy vehicles operate close to thedesign limits of the highway. Also, alcohol as a central nervous systemdepressant interacts adversely with driver fatigue. Most CMV drivers worka 9 to 10 hour-day and crash frequency tends to increase after about 7hours on the road.In summary, the NAS study concluded that, at any BAC above zero, most commercialdrivers would experience a degradation in skill that would increase therisk of crash involvement. The NAS study further estimated that each yearthere are about 750 fatal accidents, 7,700 injury accidents, and another4,750 property damage only accidents involving a CMV driver with a positiveBAC.Estimates of drivers with a positive BAC in fatal accidents were: all drivers,45 percent; all CMV drivers, 15 percent; all heavy truck drivers, 14 percent;all medium truck drivers, 24 percent; and all bus drivers_limited datato estimate, likely to be much lower than heavy truck drivers. (Only 20percent of the victims in fatal accidents involving a CMV are CMV drivers.)The NAS study noted that the benefits of a BAC standard for CMV operatorswill depend on the BAC level established and the amount of enforcement.According to the NAS study, and that estimates of these benefits requireextrapolating from a small and imperfect data base. Two basic enforcementscenarios and three BAC levels (zero, 0.04, and 0.10 percent) were usedin the study's cost-benefit evaluations. In these scenarios, ranges inannual benefits were estimated as follows:a. Fatalities reduced by 80 to 250 per year;b. Injuries reduced by 1,100 to 3,300 per year; andc. Property damage only accidents reduced by 700 to 2,200 per year.Costs, like benefits, will vary with BAC level selected and amount of enforcement.According to the NAS study, annual costs associated with the above benefitsare estimated to range from $27 million to $54 million. All BAC and enforcementlevel combinations studied showed benefits exceeding costs. Larger annualreductions in lives lost and injury and property damage accidents avoidedwere associated with setting BAC limits at the lowest (zero) level andgreater enforcement.In the area of enforcement, the study noted that field behavioral sobrietytests are widely used in establishing a reason to believe a driver hadbeen drinking in order to justify further investigation of the extent ofany impairment. These tests, however, typically do not detect instanceswhen a driver's BAC level is lower than 0.10 percent. The study noted thatthe agency may be able to use its regulatory authority to require CMV driversto submit to BAC tests in accident or field check point stops.In practice, BAC limits enforced are higher than those specified by law.Average BAC at arrest is 0.16 percent although most States have a 0.10percent limit.<T3>Recommendations</T3>_The recommendations section of the NAS study isreproduced in its entirety in Appendix A. Briefly, the NAS study concludesthat at any BAC level above zero, most commercial drivers would experiencea degradation in skill that would increase the risk of crash involvement.The majority (three-fourths) of the committee recommended that penaltiesrequired by the Act be applied to violations of 0.04 percent BAC. The majorityalso recommended reducing the BAC limit for commercial driver to zero,but with a lesser penalty (license revocation for 24 hours to 30 days)for violations below 0.04 percent. A minority (one-fourth) of the committeerecommended that existing State per se limits (perhaps reduced to 0.08percent BAC) are appropriate when the penalties associated with violationare those mandated by the Act.The complete report, ``Zero Alcohol and Other Options_Limits for Truckand Bus Drivers,'' Transportation Research Board Special Report 216, 1987,may be purchased from the Transportation Research Board, 2101 ConstitutionAvenue NW., Washington, DC 20418. There is a $20.00 fee for this report.A copy of the complete report is available for examination in the docket.Discussion of Proposed RuleBased on both the findings and evidence presented in the NAS report andthe comments received in response to the ANPRM, the FHWA proposes to amendParts 383, 391, and 392 of the FMCSRs. The proposed rule would also establish0.04 percent or above as the level of BAC at which a CMV operator wouldbe deemed impaired by alcohol and subject to disqualification. The proposedrule would also establish 0.10 percent BAC, or such lesser amount as establishedby a State, as the level a commercial driver is ``under the influence''of alcohol and subject to State sanction for such a violation.The proposed changes to Parts 383 and 391 also include a definition of``conviction.'' On June 1, 1987, the FHWA published a final rule implementingthe Act in part (52 FR 20574). This final rule defined ``conviction'' tomean:<ITAG tagnum="20">* * * the final judgment on a verdict [or] finding of guilty, a pleaof guilty, or a forfeiture of bond or collateral upon a charge of a disqualifyingoffense, as a result of proceedings upon any violation of the requirementsin this part, or an implied admission of guilt in States with implied consentlaws.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(52 FR at 20587).</ITAG>The term ``conviction'' is used in andSection; 383.51 pertaining to the disqualificationof drivers. Drivers who are convicted of certain criminal offenses willbe disqualified from driving a CMV. Similarly, andSection; 391.15 of theFMCSRs provides that convictions for certain offenses will result in disqualification.Part 391, however, does not include a definition of conviction. In thepast, the FHWA has looked to State laws to determine whether a person was``convicted'' of an offense, thus triggering a disqualification. Becauseof the stringent penalties contained in the 1986 Act, the FHWA determinedthat it would be necessary to ensure that interstate drivers be treatedequitably. Thus, the FHWA decided to develop a uniform definition of ``conviction''for purposes of the Federal disqualification provisions. The agency alsobelieves that a uniform definition will promote the purposes of the Act,i.e., to remove unsafe commercial drivers from the road.The responses received by the FHWA to the series of questions raised aboutthe definition of ``conviction'' in the June 1, 1987, final rule clearlyindicated support for the definition of conviction used in the UniformVehicle Code and Model Traffic Ordinance (UVC). Thirty-five States alreadyuse definitions which closely follow the UVC. Of these thirty-five, almostall include forfeiture of bond or collateral and certain administrativefindings, and thirteen include pleas of ``no contest.''Accordingly, the FHWA now proposes to amend the definition of ``conviction''in 49 CFR 383.5 and to define ``conviction'' in 49 CFR 391.3. The proposeddefinition is based, in part, on the comments received in response to theJune 1, 1987, final rule and is drawn from the UVC. The proposed definitionincludes pleas of nolo contendere and would also include an administrativefinding by the State that a violation was committed.Finally, the proposed change to Part 392 would result in any measured positiveBAC of an in-service driver being considered as a violation of the prohibitionon alcohol impairment within 4 hours of going on-duty.BAC Levels for Driving Under the InfluenceThe FHWA believes that the NAS report presents convincing evidence thatsignificant driving impairment occurs at BAC levels below 0.10 percent,the standard found in most State laws. The findings from three researchapproaches of alcohol impairment laboratory studies, closed course drivingstudies, and accident studies are consistent both within the general researchapproach type, and between research approach types in support of this conclusion.As outlined in the NAS report, truck driving is much more demanding thancar driving. Fatigue is a significant factor in truck accidents and alcoholinteracts adversely with fatigue. Thus, the FHWA is proposing that 0.04percent BAC be set as the BAC level at which a person when operating aCMV shall be subject to the disqualification provisions of Parts 383 and391.The FHWA believes that, in enacting the Commercial Motor Vehicle SafetyAct of 1986, the Congress intended the FHWA and the States to work togetherto remove unsafe operators of CMVs from the road. In specifically enactingsections 12008, 12009, and 12011, the FHWA believes that the Congress intendedthat the FHWA and the States take actions necessary to remove operatorsof CMVs from the road when those operators drink and drive. The FHWA viewsthe disqualification provisions of the Act as supplementing existing Statedrunk driving laws and programs, and as being targeted to a specific groupof regulated drivers who pose an extraordinary risk to public safety byreason of sizes of the vehicles they drive, the nature of the cargos theytransport, and the typical mileage they drive in any given period of time.To comply with the Act, the FHWA expects States to adopt laws and/or regulationsnecessary to disqualify CMV drivers from operating CMVs when they havebeen found to have operated CMVs at a BAC level in excess of the levelestablished by this rulemaking action. The FHWA views this as the minimumState action necessary to avoid the loss of Federal-aid highway funds.The FHWA does not intend to require the States to impose additional sanctionsagainst CMV drivers with such BAC levels; nor does not FHWA intend to precludethe States from going beyond these minimum requirements.The FHWA envisions its current proposal as establishing three progressivelymore stringent penalties to address drunk driving by CMV operators. Thefirst step would place a CMV operator immediately out-of-service for 24hours, if found to have a measurable positive BAC level, even below 0.04percent. The FHWA is proposing to revise 49 CFR 392.5 accordingly. Thesecond step would be to impose the disqualifications set forth in section12008 on those drivers found to have operated a CMV with a BAC level ator above 0.04 percent. The third step would be to impose a disqualificationin accordance with section 12008 coupled with any other State penalty requiredby State law (e.g., mandatory imprisonment, fines, rehabilitation programs,etc.) for those CMV operators found to have operated a CMV with a BAC levelat or above the level adopted by the State to define operating a motorvehicle ``under the influence of alcohol'' by any driver in the State (thislevel is 0.10 percent BAC in most States).The FHWA recognizes that disqualifications for drivers with law BAC levelswould not occur unless States adopt the 0.04 percent BAC standard for CMVoperators. For drivers subject to Part 383 and its disqualifications, theStates would need to adopt the 0.04 percent standard to avoid a loss ofFederal-aid highway funds beginning in FY 1994.Out-of-Service ViolationsThe NAS panel and several respondents to the ANPRM were concerned thatno action be taken that could be interpreted as implying that it is acceptableto operate a CMV with some alcohol in the operator's system. These groupsrecommended that a zero BAC standard with some out-of-service sanctionsbe established to address this concern. A majority of the NAS suggestedthat the penalty for a positive BAC below 0.04 percent be 24 hours to 30days license revocation for the first offense and 30 days to 1 year forsecond and subsequent offenses. By contrast, the California Highway Patrolbelieves that there should be a penalty on evidence of alcohol consumption,but the penalty should be a minimum of 4 hours out-of-service.Motor vehicle operators subject to the current andSection; 392.5 of the FMCSRsare prohibited from consuming an intoxicating beverage or being under theinfluence of alcohol within 4 hours of going on duty or operating or havingphysical control of a motor vehicle. As shown in Figure 3-1 of the NASreport (page 42), alcohol is metabolized in the body at a rate of about0.015 percent BAC per hour. In 4 hours, therefore, approximately 0.06 percentBAC would be metabolized by the average person. Consequently, a BAC levelof 0.06 percent, or lower, 4 hours before going on duty would, in effect,result in a zero BAC level by the time the average driver goes on duty.Thus, the FHWA proposes to amend Part 392 to clarify these rules basedon the proposed selection of 0.04 percent BAC for the sanctions of theAct and available information on alcohol metabolism rates. Any CMV driverwith a measured positive BAC level while he/she is in-service would besubject to the 24-hour out-of-service sanction.In summary, the FHWA proposes to amend Parts 383, 391, and 392 to establisha set of sanctions for operators of CMVs found to be driving commercialmotor vehicles while at positive BAC levels as follows:(1) Any measured positive BAC level_immediate 24 hour out-of-service sanction;(2) At or above 0.04 percent BAC_the disqualification sanctions of theAct; and(3) At or above 0.109 percent BAC or any lesser level set by State lawfor ``driving under the influence''_existing State sanctions.The BAC levels of drivers of CMVs are generally determined by tests administeredby the police officers or other law enforcement agents during lawful stopsand investigations on the highways. Nothing contained in the proposed ruleor in the discussion is intended to alter in any way the conditions underwhich highway stops and investigations are currently authorized, the methodby which tests are administered or the frequency of such testing.State ComplianceThree levels of penalties would be established by this proposal for CMVoperators who drink and drive. States would need to adopt and implementthese penalties or face a loss of Federal-aid highway funds. The firstlevel would require that any CMV operator with a positive level of alcoholconcentration be placed out-of-service for 24 hours. This penalty wouldbe consistent with section 12009 (a)(21) of the Act and the full NAS committeerecommendation that any alcohol consumption on the job is inappropriatefor CMV operators and incompatible with safety. The second level, whichwould trigger the disqualification sanctions of the Act when a CMV driverhas an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or higher, results from the requirementsof sections 12009 (a)(15) and (16) as they pertain to penalties for drinkingand operating a CMV. This penalty would reflect the recommendation of themajority of the NAS committee. The third level would trigger existing Statepenalties for convictions for driving while under the influence that resultfrom current State laws as well as the disqualification sanctions. Thispenalty relates to the requirements of sections 12008(f) and 12009(a)(3).All States have illegal per se laws have with BAC limits of 0.10 percentor lower, except for one. This State, however, has a presumptive law witha BAC level of 0.10. The FHWA's assessment, therefore, is that States wouldsubstantially comply with the Act if they have adopted the 0.04 percentthreshold for disqualification, and if they have either per se or presumptiveBAC limits of 0.10 percent or lower. The FHWA requests comment on whetherStates would be in substantial compliance with the Act based on their adoptionand implementation of the penalties as described above.Other IssuesA minority of the NAS committee members believes that existing State perse limits (perhaps reduced to 0.08 BAC) are appropriate when the penaltiesassociated with violations are those mandated by the Act. Two reasons werestated for this minority position: the severity of the penalties mandatedby the Act, and perceived problems enforcing lower BAC standards, includingpossible challenges under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution(i.e., prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures) or underState law.The FHWA believes that the convincing evidence presented in the NAS reportthat significant driving impairment occurs at low BAC levels, includingthe 0.04 percent level recommended in that report, coupled with the seriousrisks posed to public safety by drivers whose abilities to control CMVsare impaired by alcohol use, warrant the imposition of these severe sanctions.The FHWA believes that most drivers faced with the possibility of disqualificationwill avoid it by complying with the law. The FHWA further believes thatthose who cannot or will not comply with the law should be removed fromthe road so as to eliminate the public safety risk they present.The FHWA recognizes the seriousness of the legal issues, including possibleconstitutional issues, raised by those concerned with enforcement of lowBAC standards. The FHWA proposes to rely primarily on the States to enforcethe disqualification requirements for drivers with the BAC levels specifiedby this action. In accordance with the President's Executive Order on Federalism(E.O. 12612, October 26, 1987), the FHWA believes that it should allowStates the maximum administrative discretion possible to achieve the objectivesof the Act. The FHWA encourages the States to develop their own policiesto achieve these objectives.The FHWA believes that the evidence of the NAS study justifies these proposalsas cost-effective, appropriate safety measures in the public interest.The FHWA proposal would result in a more stringent standard for CMV driversthan other motor vehicle operators. However, improving safety is the purposeof the Act and the FHWA believes that Congress intended that a stricterstandard for CMV drivers be applied if justified by an evaluation of relatedcosts and benefits. The 0.04 percent BAC standard recommended by NAS andincluded in the FHWA proposal for purposes of disqualification would alsotreat CMV operators in a way which is comparable to the way that aviation,commercial maritime, and railroad operators are treated with respect todriving under the influence of alcohol. Federal rules currently establisha 0.04 percentge BAC level as defining ``under the influence'' for railroademployees (49 CFR 219.101), any crew member on a civil aircraft (14 CFR91.11), and any commercial vessel operator (49 CFR 95.020).The FHWA believes that such a standard can be reasonably and fairly enforced.Devices to measure BAC are currently required to satisfy standards forprecision and accuracy at zero, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.15 percents BAC (<T4>Federal Register</T4> December 14, 1984 (49 FR 48854)).Concern was expressed by the IBT on issues relating to drivers called towork on short notice. The IBT urged that motor carriers be prohibited frompenalizing drivers who inform their employers that the have recently consumedalcohol and may be in violation of BAC requirements. Roadway Express notedcosts associated with some drivers using an extended call period to avoidworking at inconvenient times. The FHWA believes that such issues are besthandled by management-labor negotiations and that the time required forthe States to adopt needed revisions in their laws will provide an opportunityfor such negotiations.A majority of the NAS proposed that second violations in a BAC range fromany measured positive BAC to 0.04 percent be met with some intermediatelevel sanction. Drivers subject to Part 392 are currently required to reportout-of-service sanctions to the licensing State and employer (49 CFR 392.5(d)).Some States currently place these violations on their records. Privateenforcement of such repeat violations is another option. The FHWA is requestingcomments on whether some intermediate level sanctions for second offensesbelow 0.04 percent BAC are appropriate.The NAS panel recommended that drivers detected with positive BACs lessthan 0.04 percent be referred to a competent authority to determine whetherthey have an alcohol problem and, if so, be referred for treatment. TheFHWA supports voluntary rehabilitation programs. However, the FHWA believesthat it would be inappropriate to mandate such referrals in this Federalregulation.As noted in the NAS study recommendations, States would be required toadopt the Federal BAC standard of 0.04 percent as the level at which CMVdrivers would be subject to the mandated disqualifications to avoid a lossof Federal-aid highway funds. To implement this standard, some States mayneed to repeal or at least amend (i.e., to exempt CMV drivers from) thatsection of their presumptive laws under which a person testing below 0.05percent BAC is presumed not to be under the influence of alcohol. The FHWAis seeking to determine if practical alternatives exist to such requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Questions</ITAG>In conjunction with the proposed rulemaking actions, comments are requestedon the following questions:(1) Are some intermediate Federal sanctions for second offenses below 0.04percent BAC appropriate? (2) What are the practical alternatives to the repeal or amendment withrespect to CMV drivers of those sections of State laws under which personstesting below 0.05 percent BAC are presumed not to be under the influenceof alcohol?(3) As discussed earlier, a minority of the NAS panel members believesthat the current State BAC limits (generally 0.10 percent) are appropriatefor commercial drivers given the severity of the sanctions mandated inthe Act. Some States and industry representatives have expressed the concernthat the severity of these sanctions could serve to inhibit either enforcementof the standard or convictions based on the standard. Therefore, the FHWAis interested in whether there are ways to resolve these concerns. Onealternative may be to create a set of sanctions with lesser penalitiesthan the FHWA proposal for first-time violators. Under such an alternative,drivers with a first or subsequent violation consisting of a positive BAClevel less than 0.04 percent would be placed out-of-service for 24 hours.The first-time violator who has a BAC level while on-duty at an ``intermediatelevel'' of between 0.04 percent and 0.10 percent would be disqualifiedfrom operating a CMV for a period less than 1 year. For example, 120 days,which is the current sanction for three serious traffic violations in a3-year period (49 CFR 383.51(c)(3)(ii)) could be used as the disqualificationperiod. The first-time violator with a BAC level of 0.10 percent or more,while on-duty would be subject to the 1-year or 3-year sanctions of theAct. Drivers with subsequent violations with BAC levels at or above 0.04percent would be subject to lifetime disqualification as included in theAct. The FHWA solicits comments on ways, such as the example discussedabove, which might resolve the enforcement and conviction concerns. Also,the FHWA is interested in the details of such alternatives, including whatthe appropriate sanction imposed would be for the ``intermediate level''violations and whether or not drivers carrying hazardous materials shouldbe subject to more severe sanctions for violations at BAC levels of lessthan 0.10 percent.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact</ITAG>The FHWA has determined that this action does not constitute a major ruleunder Executive Order 12291. The proposed rule is not expected to resultin an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or lead toa major increase in costs or prices, or have significant adverse effectson the United States economy. However, because of the public interest inthe issue of CMV safety and alcohol use and the expected benefit in transportationsafety, this proposed rule is considered significant under the regulatorypolicies and procedures of the DOT. For this reason, and pursuant to ExecutiveOrder 12498, this rulemaking action has been included on the RegulatoryProgram for significant rulemaking actions.The economic impacts of this rulemaking that will occur are primarily mandatedby the statutory provisions themselves. The FHWA has prepared an overallregulatory evaluation for the various motor vehicle rulemaking actionsthat will be issued to implement the Act. This evaluation, which addressessome of the provisions contained in the final rule issued on June 1, 1987(52 FR 20574), and the proposed testing and licensing standards publishedon December 11, 1987 (52 FR 47326), is in the public docket and availablefor inspection in the Headquarters office of the FHWA, 400 Seventh StreetSW., Washington, DC 20590, Room 4205. Specific impacts associated withthis NPRM were analyzed in the NAS study and are summarized below.The NAS study examined the costs and benefits of a scenario which involvedincreased enforcement at three BAC levels, 0.10, 0.04, and zero percent.In this enforcement scenario passive sensors and/or portable breath testerswere assumed to be used. Using $1 million as the value of a life, the specifiedminimum value for DOT regulatory purposes, the NAS study found the benefitto cost ratio for the 0.10 percent BAC option to be 6.6. For both the 0.04percent and zero BAC options the benefit cost ratio was found to be 6.7.Using the same increased enforcement strategy assumptions, but assumingthat the use of passive sensors and or portable breath testers would notbe legally permitted resulted in benefit to cost ratio ranging from 4.1to 4.9 for the three BAC levels studied.As noted in the NAS report, the estimated benefits and costs are basedon extrapolation from a limited and imperfect data base. Nonetheless, thebenefits would have to be overestimated by in excess of 650 percent, relativeto cost, before any of the stated increased enforcement levels and/or lowerBAC levels would not be cost-effective when the above devices are usedto determine probable cause. Greatest absolute benefits were with the zeroBAC option with the least being at 0.10 percent BAC.A significant part of the motor carrier industries covered by the Act aremade up of small firms, from one-person, one-truck operations of some owner-operators,to the thousands of small fleet operators throughout the country. For thisreason, the benefit and cost considerations described in the NAS studyand the preliminary regulatory evaluation/initial regulatory flexibilityanalysis as applicable to employers and the motor carrier industry in general,are equally applicable to the small entity component of the industry. Smallentities have been represented at public meetings held to discuss the Actand have had opportunities to submit comments to the public docket establishedin conjunction with FHWA's ANPRM of March 23, 1987, (52 FR 9192). The FHWAis fully committed to doing all that it can to ensure that no undue burdensare placed on small entities as a result of this proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Assessment</ITAG>This action proposes to amend portions of the FMCSRs primarily to includedriving at BAC levels of 0.04 percent or higher as a disqualifying offensefor CMV operators. Section 12008(f) of the Act directs the Secretary totake this action pursuant to notice and comment rulemaking. Failure toestablish a BAC level will result in the adoption of a 0.04 level by operationof law.State laws and regulations are not preempted by this action. However, inorder to avoid a withholding of Federal-aid highway funds, States are requiredto adopt the BAC level established pursuant to this rulemaking or thatlevel which is established by section 12008 if the agency does not setthe level.The statutory basis for this proposed action is expressly set forth inthe Act. The FHWA has carefully considered the federalism implicationsof this action in light of the principles, criteria, and requirements ofthe President's Executive Order on Federalism, E.O. 12612, October 26,1987. This proposed action limits the policymaking discretion of the Statesonly in narrow ways, and does so ony to achieve the national safety goalsof the Act. This action would impose only minimal additional costs andburdens on the States as outlined above. The FHWA does not believe thatthis proposed action would materially affect the States' ability to dischargetraditional State governmental functions or other aspects of State sovereignty.Accordingly, the FHWA further believes that this proposed action wouldbe consistent with the President's Executive Order on Federalism.<ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix A_Recommendations of the NAS Study</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 requires the Secretaryof Transportation to establish a BAC standard for commercial vehicle driversand mandates a penalty for violating the newly established BAC limit aslicense revocation for one year on the first offense and permanent lossof the commercial license on the second offense.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The study committee believes that any consumption of alcohol on thejob by commercial vehicle drivers is inappropriate for the work place andincompatible with traffic safety. The majority of the committee (three-fourths)recommends that the penalities required by the Act be applied to violationsof 0.04 percent BAC. Moreover, consistent with the principle that alcoholconsumption is inappropriate for the work place, the majority favors reducingthe BAC limit for commercial vehicle drivers to zero, but also recommendsthat a lesser penalty than that required by the Act be applied to DUI violationsbelow 0.04 percent. A penalty of license revocation for 24 hours to 30days is recommended for drivers detected with BACs greater than 0.01 butless than 0.04 percent (use of 0.01 for the lower end of the range wouldaccount for measurement error). The driver should also be referred to acompetent authority to determine whether he has an alcohol problem, andif so, should receive treatment. In addition, the violation should be placedon the driver's record. This recommendation parallels the current Federalregulation that prohibits interstate commercial vehicle drivers from drinkingon the job and within 4 hours of reporting to work. The penalty for violatingthe current Federal regulation is for the driver to be placed out-of-servicefor 24 hours. In contrast to this penalty, the majority of the committeerecommends that some action on the license be taken to ensure that a recordis made of the violation and that the driver is referred for screeningand subsequent treatment. On the second and subsequent offense of drivingwith a BAC greater than zero but less than 0.04 percent, the period forloss of license should range from 30 days to 1 year. Through the broadregulatory power of the office, the Secretary of Transportation could setthe BAC standard at zero with these lower penalties and still require theStates to adopt the penalties mandated by the Act for violations of 0.04percent BAC.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The majority of the committee favors setting an explicit policy ofzero BAC because it provides an unequivocally clear message to driver thatalcohol in the bloodstream_whether from a beer with lunch or because ofa hangover_is incompatible with the safe operation of commercial vehicles.A zero limit enforced by the public sector would also strengthen the policiesof many private companies that strictly prohibit alcohol consumption onthe job or before reporting to work.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A minority of the committee members believes that the existing stateper se limits (perhaps reduced to 0.08 percent BAC) are appropriate whenthe penalties associated with violation are those mandated by the Act.These members also believe that it will be very difficult to establishprobable cause at low BACs. The steps needed to establish probable causeat low BACs, facilitated by use of portable breath testers to screen drivers,could be interpreted as a search under the Fourth Amendment and could thereforebe ruled unconstitutional. Without the use of portable breath testers andpassive sensors, few drivers with BACs below 0.08 would be detected andthe deterrent effect would be small. The majority of the committee, however,believes that the courts will recognize the government's interest in protectinginnocent drivers and permit use of portable breath testers for screening.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The entire committee recommends that the BAC standard decided on bythe Secretary of Transportation apply to drivers of CMVs weighing 26,000pounds or more, drivers of passenger buses, and drivers of vehicles haulinghazardous materials. The estimated benefits and costs of the zero BAC policyfor drivers of buses and trucks weighing 26,000 pounds or more are summarizedin Table 7-3. The Federal Highway Administration has already ruled thatthe uniform license provisions of the Act will not apply to drivers ofCMVs weighing between 10,000 and 26,000 pounds. The Federal Governmentand the States have a considerable task ahead of them to develop and coordinatethe application of these new regulations to drivers of heavy trucks andpassenger buses. Once that process is well under way, the committee recommendsreducing the BAC limit, as suggested earlier, for drivers of CMVs weighingless than 26,000 pounds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If the Secretary adopts a lower BAC standard, some additional stepsare necessary to ensure a successful policy. The U.S. Department of Transportationshould develop support for enforcing a lower BAC limit from State and localauthorities and develop a public information campaign to communicate thenew policy to CMV drivers. To assist in deterrence, the States should handleviolations of the adopted BAC limit by revoking driver licenses throughan administrative process with appropriate protection of due process. Ifthe Secretary adopts a BAC limit below 0.05 percent, the States will alsoneed to repeal that section of their presumptive laws under which a persontesting below 0.05 percent BAC is presumed not to be under the influenceof alcohol.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,14</C><T4>TABLE </T4>7-3._<T4>Estimated Benefits and Costs of Zero BAC Standard (Excluding MediumTrucks)</T4><H1>Category</H1><H1>Annual effect</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Lives saved<D>120-220</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nonfatal injuries averted<D>1,400-2,500</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Medical savings (in thousands of dollars)<D>9,000-16,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Property damage savings (in thousands of dollars)<D>7,000-12,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Delay savings (in thousands of dollars)<D>3,000-6,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Public and private enforcement costs (in thousands of dollars)<D>34,000-38,000</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Those States that have not already adopted the language recommendedin the Uniform Code that defines per se limits in terms of both alcoholconcentration and breath alcohol concentration should be urged to do so.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary should also consider adopting additional steps to facilitateenforcement. For example, it could be required, by regulation, that asa condition of licensure, drivers consent to being screened with hand-heldbreath-testing devices to assist in establishing reasonable suspicion andprobable cause. Such a requirement would assist officers in those caseswhen a driver refuses to cooperate in the screening phase. The refusalof a driver to submit to screening would be permitted as evidence in establishingprobable cause. Drivers might also be required to consent to an evidentialtest once probable cause has been established. In addition, in order tomaximize the deterrence benefits, the Secretary could urge the 25 Statesnot currently allowing the use of portable breath testers in the screeningphase to pass enabling legislation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Adoption of lower BAC limits and experimentation with different enforcementstrategies and sanctions should be carefully evaluated. This evaluationshould be carried out by independent researchers. To improve quality ofdata for such an evaluation, the DOT should continue to emphasize the importanceof reporting BACs of commercial vehicle drivers involved in crashes andshould support research to determine the incidence of drinking and drivingby commercial vehicle drivers. Experience with the costs of alternativeBAC limits and estimates of their deterrent effects will provide the bestbasis for deciding whether the BAC limits and sanctioning patterns recommendedin this report are appropriate or should be adjusted.</ITAG>In consideration of the foregoing, the FHWA proposes to amend Title 49,Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter III, Subchapter B, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Parts 383, 391, and 392</ITAG>Highway safety driver requirements, Highways and roads, Licensing, Motorcarriers_driver qualification, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.217, MotorCarrier Safety)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued on: May 5, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.
