Theresearch division has a variety of staff in various types of work ...andP;  thebasic problem we were trying to solve was how those people and theircomputers ...andP;  can communicate better and essentially distribute theirexpertise to locations in the corporation that need it on a timely basis.&quot;andM;Work on the network began in October.andP;  The three main buildings at theresearch site, which contain the majority of staff and computers, have beenlinked using an FDDI ring.andP;  Buildings with less staff and computers areconnected off the main buildings.andP;  The total floor space involved is about34,000 square feet and approximately 700 staff work in the area.andM;&quot;The plan is once the price of this technology comes down, we'll be addingadditional FDDI components in our various buildings to meet our increasingthroughput and bandwidth requirements,&quot; says Pereira.andM;Network integrator LanStart Inc. of Oakville, Ont.andP;  is installing the FDDInetwork at Ontario Hydro.andP;  The FDDI components used -- four FX8210 Ethernetto FDDI Learning Bridges -- were developed by Fibronics International Inc.andO;based in Hyannis, Mass.andM;&quot;I can assure you that FDDI is the most important and hottest issue in almosteverybody's mind who's building networks today,&quot; says Mike Everatt, LanStartpresident and general manager.andP;  &quot;People are starting to think of FDDI as thevehicle of the future for joining networks.&quot;andM;The Ontario Hydro network internally connects high resolution graphicsworkstations, a parallel processing machine running Unix, Macintoshes, PCsand DEC machines.andP;  With such a wide array of platforms, Pereira says he wassurprised to find no problems with the connections.andM;&quot;The protocol that we standardized on is called TCP/IP -- TransmissionControl Protocol/Internet Protocol -- in addition to Novell NetWare protocol,and we really had no problem implementing different vendors' implementationsof TCP/IP,&quot; he states.andM;According to Fibronics president and chief executive officer, John Hale, oneof the most important features of FDDI is its adherence to standards.andO;Fibronics has been a member of the FDDI standards committee since itsinception and has already spent in excess of $10 million on its FDDIdevelopment.andP;  &quot;The actual user of the standard is ensured that the investmentthat they make right now in FDDI is an investment not only for now but forthe future,&quot; he comments.andM;Future plans call for the Kipling site to be linked to the corporate datacentre as well as the University of Toronto's Cray supercomputer.andO;&quot;Essentially what we'll have once that is completed is one big 100 Mbps FDDIring which is 10 times the speed of Ethernet,&quot; says Pereira.andM;He adds that the research division gains a lot of expertise, engineers andphysicists from the university and has formed many industry educationalliaisons with it.andP;  &quot;So we require tight communications with the universityfor some of these programs as well as the ability to use the computing powerof one of Canada's most powerful computers.&quot;andM;It took six months of work by two people to create the business plan for ICE.andO;Because the installation will be over $1 million (it's between $1 to $2million), an audit must be performed at the end of five years to ensure thatthe benefits predicted are realized.andM;For Pereira that has meant a lot of planning for future growth and addedcapabilities as well as good security and backup measures.andP;  The high-speedelectronics in the three buildings feed fibre optic Ethernet devices which inturn feed the wiring closets.andP;  The network can be reconfigured by using patchcables to take out the FDDI components, allowing it to work as simply a fibreoptic ethernet backup.andP;  Copper cabling in areas that aren't electricallynoisy also provides a backup to the fibre optics.andM;Ontario Hydro has also purchased network management software from Fibronicsthat makes it possible to view the entire network on one computer.andP;  Ifthere's a break in one of the fibre optic cables it will flash on the screenand generate an alarm condition.andM;Pereira adds he has also purchased a transportable machine capable of runningvarious vendors' network management software that will provide &quot;a portablenetwork diagnostic tool.andP;  The whole idea is that the technology is great, butit's what you do with it and what we're planning to do with it is meet realbusiness needs as well as technical computing needs,&quot; he says.andM;One of the advantages for employees at the research division is that theywill be able to call in to the network from remote locations.andP;  This meansbeing able to work at home or call in while out of town.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
