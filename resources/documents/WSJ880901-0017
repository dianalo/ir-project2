But trading volume once again was sluggish as investors awaited an important economic report to be released tomorrow.    Long-term Treasury bond prices advanced for the fourth day in a row, gaining about 1/4 of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. As of late yesterday, the latest 30-year government bonds yielded 9.30%, down slightly from 9.33% Tuesday. As recently as last Thursday, these bonds were yielding 9.46%, the highest in more than eight months.    While U.S. bond prices advanced, Japanese, West German and British government bonds slumped. Japanese issues fell especially sharply as the yen dropped against the dollar.    Traders expect activity in the U.S. credit markets to remain light ahead of the Labor Department's employment report for August, to be released tomorrow morning. The employment figures are highly volatile from month to month, frequently triggering huge moves in bond and stock prices. Federal Reserve officials pay particular attention to these figures in setting their credit policy.    &quot;People are in a vacation mode and trying to even out positions&quot; ahead of the employment report, said Donald P. Sheahan, executive vice president at Nikko Securities Co. International.    Jay N. Woodworth, senior domestic economist at Bankers Trust Co., expects the report to indicate slightly slower economic growth in August. That, he said, would calm inflation fears, at least temporarily, and help lift bond prices further. But he insists that the economy will regain momentum later this year, leading to higher interest rates.    Mr. Woodworth predicted that the report will show a slight increase in the civilian unemployment rate to 5.5% from 5.4% in July. He also estimated that the number of workers on business payrolls increased about 225,000 to 250,000 in August, compared with July's gain of 283,000.    &quot;I think we will look back on these numbers for July and August as indicating only momentary weakness, and we'll see pretty strong economic numbers again soon,&quot; Mr. Woodworth said. &quot;The underlying economic situation is still very strong.&quot; Thus, he said, &quot;The increase in interest rates for this cycle isn't over yet.&quot;    Most forecasters in several recent surveys expect the report to show little or no change from the July figures. According to the average estimate of 15 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, the civilian unemployment rate in August was unchanged at 5.4%. The survey also calls for an increase of 224,000 in the numbers of workers on business payrolls.    &quot;If we see a number over 275,000 or 300,000, the bond market is going to sell off,&quot; Mr. Woodworth predicted.    Whatever the case, some investment managers contend that long-term bonds are at levels that offer attractive returns.    &quot;We feel better about bonds than we did earlier this year,&quot; said Samuel Thorne Jr., a managing director at Scudder, Stevens andamp; Clark in Boston. &quot;Inflation isn't going to get as bad as many people seem to think.&quot;    Treasury Securities   Treasury bond prices finished higher, closely tracking the dollar's performance in the foreign-exchange markets.    The latest 30-year Treasury bonds rose to 98 6/32 from 97 30/32 Tuesday. The government's latest 10-year notes advanced 1/8 of a point to 100 2/32, while the yield declined to 9.24% from 9.26%.    Yields also declined slightly on shorter-term issues. The latest two-year Treasury notes were quoted late yesterday at 8.69%, down from 8.71%. The yield on the latest five-year, two-month Treasury notes fell to 8.96% from 8.99%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury issues rose 3.06 points to 1213.10. It ranged between 1209.40 and 1215.81.    Rates on short-term Treasury bills were little changed. The rate on the latest three-month Treasury bills declined to 7.27% bid from 7.29%, while six-month bills finished unchanged at 7.49% bid.    Foreign Bonds   Japanese and West German government bond prices slumped as the dollar strengthened.    Japanese bond prices began to slump after Bank of Japan officials reiterated that they have no intention of raising their discount rate. However, some analysts still insist that Japanese officials eventually will raise rates to bolster the yen.    As the yen fell, Japanese government bonds followed suit. Among actively traded issues, Japan's benchmark No. 105 5% bonds due 1997 were quoted late in the day at a price of 97.22, compared with 97.86 Tuesday. The yield was 5.45%, just below its high for the day, compared with 5.345% Tuesday.    In West Germany, traders also blamed the rising dollar for the bond market's slump. The government's 6 3/4% issue due 1998 ended interbank trading at 99.75 bid to yield 6.78%. That compared with Tuesday's interbank trading close of 99.90 bid to yield 6.76%. The European Investment Bank's 5 7/8% issue due 1998 was quoted late in the day at 98.45 bid, down 0.05 point from late Tuesday.    Separately, the Bundesbank said its domestic bond consortium will meet Monday to set terms for a new 10-year government bond. Traders said they expect a 6 3/4% to 6 7/8% coupon.    In London, British government issues fell despite a relatively firm performance by the pound.    Traders said the currency's recent strength may be only temporary because of widespread concern about the U.K.'s trade deficit. The benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007 fell 1/4 of a point to 113 11/32 to yield 9.97%. The 11 3/4% issue due 1991 was quoted late in the day at 101 30/32 to yield 10.76%, the same as Tuesday, while 12% bonds of 1995 were down 1/32 to 106 1/2, yielding 10.56%.    Canadian bonds were flat. Among actively traded issues, the government's benchmark 10 1/4% bonds due 1998 finished at 99 1/8 to yield 10.39%, unchanged from Monday and Tuesday.    Municipal Issues   Municipal bonds ended unchanged to slightly higher.    The session started off on a firm note, as the dollar showed signs of strength, particularly against the yen. Tax-exempt bond prices peaked by 10 a.m. EDT and drifted off the highs for the balance of the session, with Treasurys and the dollar having given back some gains.    The closely followed New Jersey Turnpike Authority 7.20% bonds due 2018 were quoted at 90 3/8 bid to yield 8.05%, unchanged from Tuesday.    News that the Washington Public Power Supply System reached a tentative agreement with bondholders to settle its part in the 1983 default on $2.25 billion of WPPSS bonds to finance two nuclear plants had negligible impact on the general municipal market.    However, word of the tentative agreement did bolster prices of bonds sold to finance the two canceled nuclear plants. As of yesterday afternoon, prices of Project 4 and 5 bonds were up more than a point on the bid side, according to traders.    Mortgage-Backed Securities   Ginnie Maes and other mortgage issues generally finished 1/8 point higher after light trading.    Ginnie Mae 9% securities for September delivery were quoted at 93, up 1/8; 10% securities at 98 7/8, up 1/8; and Freddie Mac 10% securities at 98 1/2, also up 1/8.    The Ginnie Mae 10% securities were yielding 10.30% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread to the 10-year Treasury note tightened one basis point to 107 basis points.    In derivative markets, Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. offered a real estate mortgage investment conduit, or Remic. The six-class, $250 million issue is backed by Fannie Mae 10 1/2% bonds.    Most Remics are backed by mortgage issues with substantial outstanding balances, but the Kidder Peabody issue was collateralized by pass-throughs that are relatively scarce. This can be risky for the underwriter if it can't obtain the collateral at a reasonable price.    There are about $3.2 billion of Fannie Mae 10 1/2% bonds outstanding, but only $1.4 billion are available in the secondary market because the rest already have been used for Remics or other structured mortgage transactions, according to data compiled by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    Kidder Peabody therefore must purchase nearly 20% of the supply outstanding of Fannie Mae 10 1/2% securities. The Kidder official said the firm has obtained all the necessary pass-throughs for its Remic. The Kidder Remic hasn't given a big boost to the price of Fannie Mae 10 1/2% bonds, an indication the issue isn't in tight supply. The securities were trading at 101 1/8 for September delivery, up 1/8 on the day.    Corporate Issues   Corporate issues were little changed to 1/8 point higher in light trading.    A $100 million five-year, non-callable 9 7/8% senior note offering for Aristar Inc. was priced at 99.953 to yield 9.887%. That was 90 basis points, or nine-tenths of a percentage point, above the Treasury five-year note rate. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets was the lead underwriter.    In the secondary market, dealers said, the spreads of some recently priced issues above Treasurys have widened because Treasury issues have been outperforming corporate issues in recent days. One of the bigger widenings occurred in the $200 million 10-year note offering by Bank of Nova Scotia (New York). The 10 1/8% issue was priced Monday at 99.87 to yield 10.27%, or 97 basis points above the Treasury 10-year note. Dealers said the issue was trading yesterday at 107 basis points above Treasurys. </TEXT></DOC>
