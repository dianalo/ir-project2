Pigs immunized with the experimental vaccine ate an average of22.5 pounds more feed and gained 11 pounds more weight than pigswithout the treatment, the department's Agricultural ResearchService reported.   ``If a commercial product results from this venture and isapproved by regulator agencies, it could mean more quality porkproduced at lower cost and in less time,'' said animal physiologistJerome C. Pekas.   The USDA agency has signed a three-year cooperative agreementwith Codon, a San Francisco biotechnology firm, for development andfurther testing of the vaccine.   Pekas, who works at the agency's meat animal research center inClay Center, Neb., said the vaccine is made partly from a fragmentof cholecystokinin, a natural appetite-limiting hormone made in theupper intestinal tract of pigs and humans.   When the fragment, called CCK-8, is joined to a larger foreigncarrier protein, the animal's immune system recognizes the fragmentas a foreign molecule and produces antibodies that block thenatural CCK hormone, he said.   When that happens, there is nothing to tell pigs when they'vehad enough to eat. So they keep on eating.</TEXT></DOC>
