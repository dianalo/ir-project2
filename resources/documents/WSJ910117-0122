Businesses withlong hours and seven-day operations must cope with a mix offull-time and part-time workers, government and union hourrules and employee preferences.   Staffworks, a new $2,000 program for personal computersfrom Campbell Software, Chicago, automates the process.Managers determine staffing needs for each hour of the week;then Staffworks automatically generates work schedules thatmatch those needs. One New York clothing store was surprisedto find Staffworks could cut its number of overstaffed hoursby 92% and reduce understaffed hours by 64% with the sameworkers and payroll level. After a week of testing, managersrefused to make manual schedules any longer.   Edward Renneman, a manager at Crate andamp; Barrel, aNorthbrook, Ill., housewares chain, is testing the software:&quot;Our store managers spend as much as a day a week (manually)scheduling the store because we let employees make specialrequests for work hours every week.&quot;   There are a few other PC programs around with more limitedabilities. Working Hours, a $99 package from Power UPSoftware, San Mateo, Calif., lets managers type names andhours into a computer and delivers neatly printed schedulesfor employees and managers. Who Works When, an $895 programfrom Newport Systems, Bellevue, Wash., helps with shift-basedwork such as nursing by matching people with the hours whenwork is needed.   Michael Campbell, president of Campbell Software, saysStaffworks uses an expert system to pick among severaldifferent mathematical models for making each schedule.&quot;There's 10 years of work in our `calculate schedules'command,&quot; in the program, he says. &quot;There are billions ofpotential combinations.&quot;                                                                                                          Parallel Supercomputers   Are Catching On Rapidly                                                                                                          TRADITIONAL supercomputers are being replaced by massivelyparallel computers at a much faster rate than expected.   Sandia National Laboratories, the Albuquerque, N.M.,facility that designs atomic bombs, has &quot;probably bought ourlast vector supercomputer,&quot; says William J. Camp, manager ofthe mathematical computation and science departments at thelab.   Sandia started a research project in 1987 to explore thepotential of the innovative parallel machines, which usethousands of small processors working together instead ofjust a few extremely big processors. At the time, mostscientists doubted the work would pay off before themid-1990s because it would be difficult to convert existingprograms to run on new machines.   But now, Sandia says, the 20 major programs that accountfor 95% of the lab's computing time already have beenconverted for use on massively parallel machines. Mr. Campsays the parallel computers work 10 to 100 times faster onthe lab's programs.   Sandia is one of the nation's four biggest users ofscientific computers, with seven Cray Research Inc. vectorsupercomputers installed. But in the future, the Crays willbe kept just to run small, old programs. Sandia uses parallelcomputers made by Ncube, Belmont, Calif., and ThinkingMachines, Cambridge, Mass. Cray has said it's developing aparallel supercomputer.                                                                                                          Scrambler Doesn't Make   Mush Out of Phone Voices                                                                                                          PREVENTING eavesdroppers from listening in on telephonecalls concerns more and more businesses.   Until recently, phone scramblers have caused listeners onthe other end to hear disembodied, metallic voices. That'sbecause the scramblers digitize voices, compress them andthen break them up into little pieces and jumble them around.When the unscrambler on the phone at the other endreassembles the sound, it often loses nuances of tone.   Now, acccording to vendors such as TechnicalCommunications Corp., Concord, Mass., voice quality is muchimproved. &quot;Microprocessor advances have made possible a moreaccurate representation of the voice in digital form,&quot; saysNoel Matchett, president of Information Security Inc., SilverSpring, Md., a consulting firm. That makes the phonesacceptable for business users who might reject voice qualitythat military or spy agencies would tolerate.   A new secure phone system from Octocom Systems Inc.,Wilmington, Mass., &quot;has very little distortion, which isamazing based on the encryption methods they're using,&quot; saysThomas Buckle, editor of Procomm, a San Franciscotelecommunications magazine. The Octocom phone can be usedwith any facsimile machine, and it's compact enough to put inan attache case and carry on the road to prevent listeners athotel switchboards.   At $15,000 for a pair of phones, it isn't a consumerproduct. But some business people are buying, says Octocom'sJoseph Lynch.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          MONOLOGUE 2.0, a software program from First Byte, SantaAna, Calif., reads aloud text and numbers entered on acomputer screen, making it easy to proofread lists or columnsof numbers. The $149 product also can read electronic mailwhile the user eats lunch . . . NEC's U.S. unit is selling a$1,299 speaker-phone, called VoicePoint, that doesn't havethe nasty habit of cutting off speakers and that uses digitalsignal-processing chips and echo-canceling technology to letseveral people talk at once and still be heard. Placed in themiddle of a conference table, the unit eliminates the needfor individual microphones.</TEXT></DOC>
