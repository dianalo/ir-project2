The problem is not that Marta's husband has nojob, or no land to grow coffee. Marta's problem is that her husband likes todrink.;    In San Pedro, two bottles of beer cost half the average wage of aday laborer, so even moderate drinking competes directly with food for scarcefamily income. With an alcoholic husband, Marta receives very little of hismeager wage. And, to be sure, others suffer too: According to a localnutritionist, perhaps a third of malnutrition among San Pedro's children canbe attributed to booze.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Perspective  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE WORLD IN A STUPORHOW ALCOHOLISM IS BREWING A CRISIS IN THETHIRD WORLD  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Lori Heise, a former senior researcher at the Worldwatch Institute, workedlast year with a child health project in Guatemala. This article is excerptedfrom the July-August 1991 issue of World Watch magazine.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Yet alcohol abuse is rarely recognized as a health issue, much less onethat should be of concern to developing countries. Drinking is often dismissedby Third World governments as an affliction of a degenerate few -- somethingto be tackled after the &quot;real issues&quot; of foreign debt, economic growth ordisease are conquered.;    Alcohol production is more often seen as astepping-stone to industrialization. In some deeply indebted Africancountries, breweries are among the few well-functioning industries. Andrevenue from the sale or taxation of alcohol is an important source of incomefor many Third World governments. It is little wonder that officials have beenmore concerned with expanding alcohol production than limiting its destructiveimpact on health and development.;    But sharp rises in Third World drinkingrates indicate that alcohol problems could magnify greatly in the near future,giving governments a compelling reason to reconsider their posture. The WorldHealth Organization says that if present trends continue, per-capitaconsumption in many Third World countries will equal or surpass that of theWest in less than a generation.;    It may seem patronizing to suggest thatThird World leaders should restrict what's considered a prized pleasure in thedeveloped world: a relaxing drink after a long, hard day. But in recent years,even industrial countries have come to question the wisdom of liberal alcoholpolicies in light of the burgeoning social costs.;    In the United States,for example, more than 15 million Americans are either addicted to orseriously debilitated by alcohol. When health-care costs are factored in withlost productivity and premature death, alcohol is estimated to cost the U.S.economy $86 billion a year, outstripping illegal drugs by almost $30 billion.;   According to the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism,drinking is a factor in nearly half of all U.S. murders, more than a quarterof all suicides and half of all rapes. Alcohol kills 105,000 Americans eachyear through disease, violence, accidents and addiction, and is a factor inthe deaths of an additional 100,000, or roughly 10 percent of all U.S. deaths.These are the costs developing countries will inherit if they allowconsumption to rise unchecked.;    The toll is already evident enough. InMexico, for example, liver cirrhosis -- a disease closely associated withheavy drinking -- is one of the country's top 10 causes of death and theleading cause of death among men age 25 to 54. Eleven percent of adult malesin Mexico are addicted to alcohol, rivaling the 12.5 percent estimated rateamong U.S. males.;    Alcohol's costs;  In Chile, the Pan American HealthOrganization reports that alcoholism is the principal cause of 7 percent ofdeaths and is indirectly involved in another 53 percent. In Trinidad andTobago, 47 percent of males admitted to the country's largest hospital havemedical problems related to drinking.;    In developing countries, financialhardship means that drinking is mostly sporadic, coinciding with paydays orholidays. &quot;In such countries,&quot; says Robin Room, director of the AlcoholResearch Group in Berkeley, &quot;the consequences of acute intoxication, such aswife-beating and traffic accidents, tend to be more significant than themedical complications of alcoholism, which evolve from prolonged heavy use.&quot;;   Indeed, alcohol appears to be adding a dangerous dimension to the alreadychaotic mix of pedestrians, cars, bicycles and other non-motorized vehicles onThird World streets. Studies show that as many as one-half of Third Worldcrash fatalities are alcohol-induced.;    In addition, alcohol-relatedproblems demand an alarming share of scarce community resources. One WorldHealth Organization study found that in several Mexican communities, between30 percent and 70 percent of the workloads of the local police, churchofficials and social welfare agencies could be traced to abuse of alcohol.(According to the Mexican government news agency Notimex, a mob beat to deaththe mayor of Chanal, a town in the southeastern state of Chiapas. The mayor'soffense: He banned the sale of liquor.);    Drinking even interferes with suchprimary concerns as agricultural output and worker productivity. Chileestimates that in 1981, alcohol-related production losses (e.g. absenteeism)cost its economy $1.7 billion -- an amount equal to what the nation earnedthat year from exporting copper.;    According to Marja-Liisa Swantz, asociologist at Helsinki's Institute of Development Studies, widespread&quot;problem drinking&quot; is relatively new to the Third World. Until recently,Swantz notes, &quot;drinking had a central ritualist and symbolic function&quot; indeveloping countries. Social norms strictly dictated who could drink, underwhat circumstances and how much.;    In Africa, for example, womentraditionally made beer to commemorate the end of a harvest, the birth of achild or to thank neighbors for a day of shared labor. Beer drinking was anoccasional event with consumption limited by competing demands on availablegrain and homemade beer's tendency to sour after only a day. But rapidurbanization, the advent of factory-made alcohol and the introduction of cashinto rural economies transformed drinking into a recreational pastime.;   Equally significant to the rise in Third World drinking rates, however, hasbeen a spectacular rise over the past 20 years in the general availability ofalcohol. According to the World Health Organization, of the 46 countries wherecommercial beer output grew more than 50 percent between 1975 and 1980, 42were developing countries, with the bulk of production consumed locally.Likewise, home brewing and moonshining have skyrocketed as poor Third Worldmen and women have turned to alcohol production in a desperate attempt tosurvive.;    A few developing countries, such as Botswana, Costa Rica, Mexicoand Swaziland, have tried to craft strategies to curb alcohol use. Togetherwith industrial countries such as Finland, France, Poland, Switzerland and theSoviet Union, these nations have decided that the social costs of unbridledalcohol use are no longer acceptable.;    In developing countries, where often40 percent of the population is under age 15, shaping young people's attitudestoward drinking is an important first step. Swaziland is having some successwith a school-based program that treats alcohol issues as part of a largercurriculum designed to build students' self-esteem and ability to resist peerpressure.;    How governments can help;  Governments can also help by passinglaws to counter outside forces, such as TV and radio advertisements or sportssponsorship. Mexico, for example, prohibits advertisements that link alcoholwith social prestige, athletic prowess or virility.;    Perhaps mostimportant, though, are strategies, such as price hikes and rules on when andwhere alcohol can be sold. Studies from a variety of countries show thatdrinking rates tend to rise and fall with the accessibility of alcohol.;   Like the alcoholics they harbor, many countries in both the industrial anddeveloping worlds still deny alcohol's impact. Seduced by alcohol's easyrevenues, governments prefer not to examine its costs. Measured or not, suchcosts exist.;    Just ask Marta Cotuc.
