Gonzalez, D-Texas, who said it shows the FDIC is &quot;perilously close toinsolvency.&quot;;   Congress and the Bush administration have repeatedly said theywill do whatever is necessary to keep the FDIC's promise to protect depositorsup to $100,000 per account when banks fail, even if it means giving the FDICthe same kind of taxpayer bailout required when the savings and loan insurancefund went broke three years ago.;   Gonzalez said on Friday that Congress must&quot;keep its eye on the first priority -- maintenance of a sound insurance fund&quot;and &quot;may need to act in the next 60 days to replenish the fund.&quot;;   Thatdeadline will be extremely difficult to meet, congressional banking aidessaid, because Congress will not return from its vacation recess untilmid-September, and legislation to provide additional money for the FDIC ispart of a big and intensely controversial bill that would give banks broad newpowers.;   The Bush administration and the banking industry are pushingCongress to pass the bank powers bill at the same time it replenishes theFDIC, arguing it will take more than money to cure the banking industry'sailments. Congress &quot;has plenty of time to address both&quot; issues, anadministration official said Friday.;   Banks are failing mostly because ofthe collapse of the commercial real estate market. Like savings and loansbefore them, the banks lent hundreds of billions of dollars to build hotels,stores and office buildings. Many of those buildings are now empty, and theirowners cannot pay their mortgages, saddling the lenders with massive losses.;  The situation has been made worse by the recession, which not only stalledcreation of new jobs to fill up the empty buildings, but also threw otherbusinesses into a slump, making it difficult for them to pay their debts tobanks.;   Economists say the recession seems to be ending, but in most partsof the country, the commercial real estate crash has not yet hit bottom. Bankslag behind economic trends, FDIC officials explained, so the bank failureswill continue for some time after the rest of the economy recovers.;   The GAOprojections of bank failures are based on a review of the finances of severalhundred of the nation's biggest banks. Most of the banks that fail are small,but the big banks cause the big losses.;   The auditors said 34 banks in the$100-million-plus class &quot;are more likely than not to fail in 1991&quot; at a costto the FDIC insurance fund of $5 billion.;   The FDIC has spent $4.9 billionthis year paying off depositors in 63 failed banks. Add the 34 failures citedby the GAO brings this year's cost to a record $10 billion.;   In addition,the GAO identified 64 big banks that could fail with continued financialdeterioration, costing the FDIC $22.5 billion, the GAO said.;   It'simpossible to predict when those banks will go under because banks sometimeshide their financial problems.;   The report said the FDIC &quot;will likely beinsolvent by the end of 1991 -- the exact date depends on the rate at whichinsolvent banks are identified and losses recognized.&quot;;   The GAO said theFDIC fund is in worse shape than previously reported because of the way theFDIC keeps its books. The FDIC should set aside money to pay for any bankfailures that can be seen coming, the GAO auditors contend. The FDIC resistedthat approach for months, arguing that bank failures are too hard to predict.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910824  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  704  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, August 24, 199100237153,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
