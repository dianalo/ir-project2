A. Bruce Rozet, president of California-based AssociatedFinancial Corp., said he was negotiating with several housinginvestment and management firms and hoped to transfer roughly 300of the 350 properties owned, managed or otherwise controlled by hiscompany and affiliates.   Nonetheless, Rozet said the company would challenge thesuspension, saying the accusations were without merit and that thecompany had provided documents to prove that to HUD but has beenignored.   Rozet also said Kemp's fear of scandal had virtually haltedgovernment housing programs.   ``We have now become caught up in a political campaign to divertattention from a continuing national housing policy of benignneglect in the name of HUD reform,'' Rozet said. ``The tenants arebeing made the victims while HUD carries out it scandalous vendettaagainst our company.''   Kemp, in a statement, said poor conditions at the propertiescited in the suspension letter ``speak for themselves.'' He saidhis ``outrage is not directed at any one owner or manager'' but ata number of owners and investors he says have reaped lucrative taxbenefits but invested little of their own money in the projects.   The department also released a memo from one of its attorneysthat said HUD's inspector general was working with the FBI toinvestigate whether Associated Financial Corp.'s managementaffiliate, Housing Resources Management, billed HUD for subsidiesfor vacant units at an Oklahoma development. That memo said localHUD officials in several states had raised questions about HousingResources actions.   Rozet said the company on two occasions billed HUD for subsidiesfor units that became vacant after the requests were filed. ButHousing Resources quickly reported the vacancies and overpayment toHUD, Rozet said, saying such developments were routine because ofhigh tenant turnover.   When HUD issued the suspension late last month, Rozet said hisrole as a fund-raiser for Sen. Alan Cranston of California,two-time presidential contender Jesse Jackson and other Democratsgave Republicans looking for a Democrat to draw into reports of HUDscandals an easy target. Kemp has said politics had no role in hisactions against Associated Financial and its affiliates.   At a Washington news conference he called to answer HUD'scharges, Rozet said he shared many of Kemp's goals. He contendedKemp has been misled about Associated Financial's performance by``minions'' who went after the company.   ``In HUD's desperate rush to damage our companies, HUD has, infact, hurt the people it claims to be protecting,'' said Rozet, whois scheduled to testify before Congress in the near future abouthis companies' properties, which include 45,000 subsidizedapartments.   Although the suspension only prohibits Associated Financial andits affiliates from seeking new HUD business, Rozet said Kemprecently ordered field offices to send all AssociatedFinancial-related work to agency headquarters. HUD inspectors thisweek also began visiting the properties with cameras, demanding tosee ``your worst unit,'' Rozet said.   Those developments, he said, had convinced him AssociatedFinancial had to give up the properties it controlled until itresolved its battle with HUD. Rozet said his companies wouldreceive no money through the planned transfer of control and thatHUD would have to approve the deal.   ``It's not a question of money. It's a question of housing,''Rozet said. ``If HUD won't do business with me, I have to findsomebody else that they will deal with or the tenants will just sitthere and suffer.''</TEXT></DOC>
