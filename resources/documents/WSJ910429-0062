Some accountants and lawyers blame budget cuts and harriedtax-collection offices. Others suspect that bureaucratswelcome the problem because the zealous enforcement effortshelp raise badly needed revenue. And many think thecomplaints will get worse as state and local governments layoff workers and grapple with growing deficits.</LP><TEXT>   State and city tax collectors &quot;are making taxpayers' livesmiserable because they need the bucks,&quot; says Arthur Gordon,chairman of the tax division of the New York State Society ofCertified Public Accountants and tax partner in theaccounting firm Ernst andamp; Young. Small businesses, of course,are particularly vulnerable because their taxes are morecomplicated than those of most wage earners, while they lackthe resources of big companies.   Tax practitioners say the problem is particularly bad inNew York City, the nation's fourth-biggest collector oftaxes, which faces a $3 billion deficit in the fiscal yearstarting July 1. But the frustration of small businesseselsewhere in dealing with tax collectors is mounting rapidly.   &quot;As state and local governments grow hungrier forrevenues, they're putting more pressure on small business tocough up taxes, even if the levies aren't warranted,&quot; saysStephen T. Ryan, a specialist in state and local taxes foraccountants Grant Thornton.   Mr. Ryan says Indiana is forcing more out-of-statebusinesses to collect sales taxes from Indiana residents bythreatening to audit the businesses' customers. Over the pastyear, Illinois has begun imposing a 6% penalty in all casesof underpayment, even though a state law says the penalty canbe waived for reasonable cause, says Mr. Ryan. And Californiarecently began imposing interest on late-filing penalties,even in instances where the business might have had areasonable excuse, he adds. State officials deny they'reimposing unwarranted taxes and say they're sticking to theletter of the law.   Similar complaints are arising in Connecticut,Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania,tax practitioners say.   Harley Duncan, executive director of the Federation of TaxAdministrators, says a few states and cities &quot;may be drivenby revenue needs to be tougher.&quot; And he concedes that agrowing number of states are desperate for funds.   Recent surveys by the federation show that 30 statescurrently have deficits and that 25 tax-collecting agencieshave suffered budget reductions. &quot;New York City has thebiggest reduction, 13%, but other state and city budgets havebeen cut by 6% to 8% over the past year,&quot; Mr. Duncan says.Many tax agencies are reducing staff, closing orconsolidating offices and paring spending for computers andother needed equipment, he says.   &quot;This recession is hitting the cities and states harderthan the downturn in 1982 and 1983 because the federalgovernment has sharply reduced its share of their expenses,&quot;Mr. Duncan says.   As a result, many small businesses are being increasinglysqueezed for taxes and tax penalties in instances where theagencies might have been more lenient in the past, taxpractitioners say.   Frustration is becoming particularly acute in New YorkCity. &quot;More and more taxpayers are surrendering because theyjust can't take the pain and suffering to prove they'reright,&quot; says Mr. Gordon, the accountant.   Tax accountant Jerrold Gattegno says one client hasdecided to send New York City a check for $5,000 -- though itdoesn't really owe the city the money. Mr. Gattegno, apartner at the accounting firm Deloitte andamp; Touche, says theappliance wholesaler is paying a tax-deficiency penalty forallegedly deducting subsidiary expenses from taxable income.But the expenses were incurred by the parent company, locatedelsewhere, and therefore should be deductible under city taxrules, Mr. Gattegno says.   The company feels the cost of battling the city wouldexceed any savings, he adds. The tax department's &quot;continuousnotices and failure to respond to our reporting the factsover the past two months have worn down my client'sresistance,&quot; Mr. Gattegno declares. &quot;And the problem isgetting worse as the city's budget deficit grows.&quot; Cityofficials decline to comment on this and other specificcases.   Michael Lipsky, a tax partner of Martin Rosen andamp; Co., a NewYork accounting firm, estimates that complaints from hissmall-business clients about alleged city tax harassment havetripled in the past two years. &quot;In recent months, dozens ofcompanies we work for have griped to us about the risingfrustrations they experience with New York City {overtaxation},&quot; he says. &quot;A few years ago, it was only ahandful.&quot;   Tax specialists say New York City also is landing harderthan other authorities on taxpayers who make mistakes. If ataxpayer inadvertently files an invalid extension for filinga tax return, the Internal Revenue Service imposes anegligence penalty only 10% of the time, but New York Citysocks the taxpayer 90% of the time, estimates accountantHarold Soshnick. &quot;Paying unwarranted taxes has become a costof doing business,&quot; he adds.   The city's aggressiveness in collecting taxes &quot;hasincreased sharply, making the problem of harassment a lotworse over the past year,&quot; adds Mr. Soshnick, a partner whospecializes in state and city taxes for KPMG Peat Marwick, amajor accounting firm.   The problems affect large numbers of companies. MartinRosen andamp; Co.'s Mr. Lipsky says his clients have receivedhundreds of repetitive tax-deficiency notices from the citysince early 1990 &quot;in instances where we've already proven thefull tax was paid.&quot; These notices go on and on, with city taxofficials never responding to data from taxpayers and theiraccountants showing the tax penalty was unwarranted, says Mr.Lipsky, who was an IRS agent for eight years.   City officials vigorously deny that city tax collectorsare being overaggressive in levying taxes. But they concedethat a budget crunch has reduced the city's audit andtax-assistance staff, making it tougher to handle complaintsand queries from small business.   &quot;Sure we're busy and sometimes make mistakes, but we'refair and stick to the letter of the law,&quot; says Robert Huber,an assistant commissioner in the city's Finance Department.   The Big Apple's mistakes affect small business nationwide.That's because the city collects 17 business taxes from some350,000 entrepreneurs in every state, New York City officialsnote.   To top off their problems, businesses in New York feelintimidated because the city can, without a court order, puta lien on taxpayers' bank accounts after simply alleging atax deficiency. While most local and state governments can dothe same, New York City uses this power more often,accountants say.   A New York City jeweler had a lien put on his bank accountlast August for $500. His accountant, Neil Gibgot, managingpartner of Gibgot, Willenbacher andamp; Co., Great Neck, N.Y., sayshe has informed the city at least eight times by mail andtelephone that the penalty was an error, but tax-deficiencynotices keep coming.   &quot;The city assumes that my client's fiscal year ends Dec.31, making his filing six months late, while the client'sfiscal year actually ends June 30, so the filing is on time,&quot;says Mr. Gibgot. &quot;The city continues to ignore our lettersand when we phone, a lower-level clerk tells us they'll takecare of it but doesn't call us back. A few months later,another deficiency notice arrives.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
