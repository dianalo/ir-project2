The large-scale map of the Bayangaregion shows only primeval forest crossed by rivers with not asingle paved road.   In this heart of darkness, hundreds of miles from the nearestvillage, man's closest relative in the animal kingdom, the lowlandgorilla, has found his last refuge, a sanctuary of sorts from Pygmytribes and others who hunt him for his flesh and his hide.   The gorilla is an endangered species and theoretically undertough protection in the Central African Republic. But the governmenthas neither the money nor the personnel to enforce the protectivelaws.   There are two main groups of gorillas in Africa: the mountaingorilla in Rwanda and eastern Zaire _ whose habitat and life stylehave been fully explored _ and the lowland gorilla who remainslargely a mystery.   The mountain gorilla can be seen from peak to peak and graduallyallows himself to be approached as he becomes familiar with humanbeings.   The lowland gorilla is supremely shy and elusive, explainsRichard W. Carroll of the Yale University School of Forestry andEnvironmental Studies in New Haven, Conn.   Carroll, who has made the gorilla his life's work, rarely getsclose enough to strike up an acquaintance. In more than five years'work almost exclusively concentrated on the lowland gorilla, Carrollhas yet to get one accustomed to the human presence in the forest.   He estimates that a desolate area of 40,000 square miles offorest where the Central African Republic, Cameroon and the Congomeet may still have at least 90,000 gorillas permanently settledthere. With the exception of rare logging camps along he rivers,there is no human activity in this area, and the gorillas have untilrecently remained undisturbed.   In recent years, the logging camps have developed, and there hasbeen ``heavy illegal poaching'' for meat and the ivory of elephantswho are the other main inhabitants of the region.   In the central market in Bangui, the Central African capital 220miles to the east, stands are piled high smoked monkey meat, a localdelicacy.   ``Gorillas taste like monkeys, only better,'' said Pierre Somse,who is Carroll's Pygmy guide. ``And there is more of them.''   Carroll, who lives in Bayembe with his wife and 3-year-olddaughter, has been trying to teach the Pygmies why the gorillas arebest left alone. It's an almost hopeless task.   The Pygmies go after the gorillas with bows and arrows. Butlarger Africans, those brought in to work the logging camps, userifles and even machine guns, Carroll said.   ``They bribe the Pygmies to help them by giving them clothes andliquor. In some areas, we find snares made of cables stolen from thelogging companies every few yards along trails used by thegorrillas.''   The gorillas eat the fleshy leaves of the ever-presentginger-like Aframomum shrub, the fruit of tropical trees and theeggs of termites.   ``It's quite common to see a 400-pound silverback gorilla climbmore than 100 feet up into the trees to get at the fruit,'' Carrollsaid. ``They love that more than anything.   ``They will even build a nest up in the trees and sleep there.''   In some areas on the ground, gorilla nests are visible every fiveor six yards. But the gorillas scamper away when they sense a humanbeing approach.   Carroll has been trying to persuade the Central Africangovernment to set up a wildlife reserve in the remote southwesterntip of the country. But in reality, the effort is useless unless theother two governments in the area, the Congo and Cameroon, cooperate.   Meanwhile, the poaching goes on. Even poorly paid wildlife guardssometimes find it more worth their while to hunt gorillas andelephants. And the dense forest paradoxically helps to protect thepoachers from the guards.   ``It would help to be able to get a radio tag on the animals,''Carroll said. ``We have to crawl on our hands and feet to get closeto them, and even then we don't see them 'til we are a foot or twoaway. With a radio, we could find a place ahead of them and watchthem coming.''   He said the gorillas share 90 percent of human genetic materials,and, as such, are by far the closest animals to man.   But he deplored the ineffectiveness of the present system ofcontrol and the inability of local governments and European andAmerican organizations to stop the poaching.   ``Recently we were in a camp on the Sangha River, where it formsthe border with the Congo. A Congolese gunboat came up the river andordered us to get out of there. We were clearly in the C.A.R.(Central African Republic). But quite obviously, we were interferingwith their poaching.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tues AMs, Feb. 28</NOTE></DOC>
