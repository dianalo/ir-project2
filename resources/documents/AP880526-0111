WIELAARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NATO's chief military adviser saidtoday the U.S.-Soviet treaty to remove ground-launched,intermediate-range nuclear missiles means NATO's conventionalforces must be improved.   West German Gen. Wolfgang Altenburg, chairman of NATO's panel ofchiefs of staff, said he has found no evidence the Soviet Unionwill cut back its military.   ``They (the Soviets) are not able to define in which way theirstrategy has changed from an admittedly offensive to a presentlydefensive strategy,'' he said.   Altenburg spoke after giving NATO defense ministers, at theirregular spring conference, a routine briefing on Soviet militarycapabilities.   He also predicted the NATO allies will formally ask Italy toaccept the transfer of 72 U.S. F-16 jetfighters that are to beremoved from Spain within three years.   Sources said the ministers discussed how the transfer, estimatedto cost $500 million, should be funded. Altenburg said this wouldlikely be done through NATO's joint infrastructure program.   ``I am quite sure that all members of the alliance agree that wedo this economically.''   The 72 jetfighters, comprising the U.S. Air Force's 401stTactical Fighter Wing, are to be removed from the Torrejon Air Basenear Madrid under a January agreement between Spain and the UnitedStates.   Altenburg said the Soviet Union still views NATO as an offensivealliance and that it shows no signs of reducing its militaryoutlays. ``There is no evidence whatsoever in that respect thatthings have really changed.''   He added that unabated growth in Soviet military outlays werelinked to the treaty under which hundreds of intermediate-rangenuclear missiles will be removed from Europe.   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed thetreaty Dec. 8 in Washington.   ``We think that after the INF treaty, the need to maintain ourconventional posture ... is more important than ever,'' he said.   U.S Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and his NATO colleagueswere meeting to review how the allies must share their commondefense costs and ways they can make better use of available funds.   On Wednesday, the alliance's European defense chiefs complainedthat some of the recent U.S. criticism about their contributions tothe alliance was unjustified.   In a report, the ministers detailed their contributions to NATO,countering U.S. congressional criticism that Europe fails to pullits weight in the alliance.   ``Europe is taking a fair share of the burdens in thealliance,'' Dutch Defense Minister Wim van Eekelen, chairman of themeeting of the European ministers, said later.   The debate over who pays what in NATO stems from congressionalefforts to curb U.S. defense spending.   The Europeans' report said that of NATO's standing forces,Europe provides 90 percent of the troops and artillery, 80 percentof the tanks and combat planes and 65 percent of NATO warships.   It said 3.5 million European men and women are on active dutyand 3.5 million are in reserve. By comparison, the United Stateshas 2.3 million active duty troops and 1.5 million reservists, thereport said.   In their report, NATO's European members agreed all allies mustdo more for NATO, in part by better managing their budgets.   The United States spent 6.7 percent of its gross nationalproduct on defense in 1987 against an average of 3.3 percent forthe European allies.   The Europeans argue the spending comparisons ignoreunquantifiable burdens for them, such as environmental damage fromallied maneuvers and loss of income from real estate dedicated tomilitary bases and other defense facilities.</TEXT></DOC>
