Although the Palestine Liberation Organiztaion said it plannedmass funerals for the victims, they were buried in quiet ceremoniesin Sidon's main cemetery and a Palestinian graveyard in the nearbyvillage of Darb el-Seem.   There were no anti-Israeli chants or cries for revenge that hadcharacterized funerals for victims of previous Israeli attacks.   ``We just couldn't risk mass gatherings,'' said a guerrillaofficer at one of the funerals. He refused to give his name. ``WithIsrael's appetite for attacking at its peak, we figured it's prudentto keep a low profile.''   Police said rescuers using gasoline lanterns searched the rubbleof a guerrilla base of 30 buildings pulverized in the Wednesdaymorning bombing of Sidon's Mieh Mieh refugee camp. They dug out ninebodies.   A family of six _ a man, his wife and their two sons anddaughters _ were among the bodies. The children's ages rangedbetween six and 15, police said. The three other victims wereguerrillas.   Six bodies were found immediately after the air raid on the base,which belonged to Palestine Liberation Organization chairman YasserAarafat's mainstream Fatah guerrilla group.   Four other Palestinian guerrillas were killed in a ground battlethat began after the raid with Israel's main proxy force, the SouthLebanon Army militia.   The four guerrillas belonged to the radical Fatah-RevolutionaryCouncil, which is headed by the notorious Palestinian terroristmastermind, Abu Nidal.   The Mieh Mieh air raid claimed the second heaviest casualty tollof Israel's 18 air strikes in Lebanon this year. Twenty-six peoplewere killed and 30 wounded in the first air raid north of Sidon Jan.3.   Police and guerrilla spokesmen regarded Wednesday's assault asthe worst in terms of destruction and guerrilla casualties.   ``Mieh Mieh has suffered the most severe destruction sinceIsrael's 1982 invasion'' of Lebanon, said a police spokesman inSidon. He cannot be named under standing regulations.   Among those killed was Col. Mustafa Daoud, commander of the1,000-strong Fatah militia.   The Mieh Mieh raid was followed 4{ hours later by two bombingruns against guerrilla bases of pro-Syrian Palestinian factions justsouth of Beirut and in hills overlooking the coastal town of Damour,midway between Beirut and Sidon. At least one guerrilla was wounded.   The Israeli strikes followed two foiled Palestinian guerrillaattempts to infiltrate into northern Israel from south Lebanon onTuesday. The attempts were uncovered by Israeli troops and thepredominantly Christian SLA militiamen who patrol Israel'sself-designated ``security zone'' in south Lebanon.   Israel warplanes struck bases in Lebanon on Friday and Sunday inretaliation for a suicide car bombing in the security zone last weekin which eight Israeli soldiers were killed and nine people wounded.   Twenty-one people were killed and 34 wounded in the two strikes,which were directed against Palestinian and Lebanese Shiite Moslembases in south and southeast Lebanon.   The pro-Iranian Shiite Hezbollah, or Party of God, had claimedresponsibility for the suicide bombing.</TEXT></DOC>
