Notice of some of the subpoenas, filed Tuesday in Manhattanfederal court, reflected the investment firm's intention toundertake an aggressive defense against the SEC civil chargesannounced last week after a nearly two-year probe stemming from theIvan Boesky insider trading scandal.   Unlike restrictive pretrial fact-finding rules for defendants incriminal cases, defendants in civil suits enjoy broad subpoenarights to seek testimony and other evidence used in the accusationsagainst them.   Drexel, Milken and three other employees of the firm wereaccused by the SEC of scheming with Boesky to profit on insidertrading, manipulate stock, cheat clients, keep phony books andother fraudulent acts. The SEC suit also named Miami financierVictor Posner, his son Steven and a Posner-controlled company,Pennsylvania Engineering Corp.   Those subpoenaed by the defense don't yet include Boesky, theone-time Wall Street speculator and imprisoned insider trader whonegotiated a plea-bargain cooperation agreement with the governmentand implicated Drexel and the others.   It was unclear why the Drexel team of defense lawyers have notyet sought testimony from Boesky. Martin Flumenbaum, a Milkenattorney identified as the lead lawyer in the subpoena notice, didnot return telephone calls for comment.   Regardless of whether Boesky's testimony is sought, lawyersfamiliar with the case have predicted the Manhattan U.S. attorney'soffice, which has been conducting a criminal probe of Drexel andMilken, would likely move to nullify any Boesky subpoena on groundsit could compromise the investigation.   According to the defense notice filed in court, those subpoenaedinclude investment businesses once linked to Boesky, severalManhattan art galleries once patronized by Boesky, as well as theWashington law firm of Fried, Frank, Jacobson, Harris andamp; Shriver,which helped negotiate his plea agreement.   Defense lawyers also are seeking any audio or video taperecordings held by the government in connection with the Drexelcase.   There has been speculation that Boesky secretly tapeddiscussions with Milken while cooperating with the government in1986, before the announcement that he would settle SEC insidertrading charges by paying $100 million in illicit profits andfines, as well as plead guilty to a criminal charge.   The court notice didn't identify other recipients of subpoenas.But the Wall Street Journal quoted unidentified people it said werefamiliar with the case as saying they included numerous potentialwitnesses, including former employees of Boesky-controlledorganizations.</TEXT></DOC>
