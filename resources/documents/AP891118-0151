Six theaters canceled shows Saturday night as actors andstudents called for strikes to protest police brutality at Fridaynight's demonstration, in which white-helmeted policemen clubbedhundreds of peaceful protesters.   Tens of thousands of students marched Friday for five hours tocommemorate student Jan Opletal, killed by Nazis 50 years ago. Whendemonstrators tried to reach central Wenceslas Square, policeattacked them with tear gas, dogs and clubs.   One student was fatally beaten near the square, according to TheWashington Post. It quoted witnesses as saying Martin Smid diedafter being clubbed by two riot policemen. His friends said Smidfell to the ground after being struck several times on the head andshoulders and police kept on beating him, the newspaper said Sunday.   It said Smid's parents were informed of their son's deathSaturday by two policemen who told them it was ``an accident.''   The human rights group Charter 77 likened the police crackdownto Nazi reprisals during World War II.   Seventeen demonstrators and seven policemen were officiallylisted as injured, although official media failed to report anyinjuries suffered by demonstrators.   The state news agency CTK quoted the Interior Ministry as sayingthat 143 people were taken to police stations. Nine were detainedon criminal charges and 70 on misdemeanor charges. Twenty-onepeople were fined.   Alexander Dubcek, the Communist leader of the ``Prague Spring''reforms in 1968, was detained during the march and released afterthree hours, witnesses said.   Observers estimated the size of the crowd at 30,000 people. Itwas the largest demonstration since August 1969, when crowdsgathered in downtown Prague a year after a Soviet-led invasioncrushed Dubcek's reforms.   About 1,000 people gathered on Wenceslas Square on Saturdayafternoon and walked to Narodni Street, where the protesters werebeaten the day before.   In the street, they lit candles and placed them and some flowerson the sidewalk where bloodstains could still be seen.   Journalism students and Martin Mejstrika, a student from Damu, ahigher school of acting, denounced police brutality and demandedstrikes of students and actors in theaters.   At the end of their speeches, they urged a general strike onNov. 27 between noon and 2 p.m.   ``We all feel that something must be changed,'' said Petr Placakof the independent activist youth group Children of Bohemia. ``Itwill cost us something, but we must fight for it every day.''   At least six theaters reported that shows were canceled Saturdaynight, the first day of a planned one-week strike.   ``None of the theaters are playing tonight and in every one ofthem, the resolution will be read,'' a theater director said.   At Saturday's rally, there were chants of ``We don't wantmassacres!'' ``Let's stop bloodshed!'' and ``An end to one-partyrule.''   On Wenceslas Square, two or three police cars patrolled the area.   As the demonstrators marched toward Narodni Street, they chantedsuch slogans as ``You were lying again!'' ``Freedom for politicalprisoners!'' and ``Long Live Havel!'' a reference to playwrightVaclav Havel, Czechoslovakia's best-known dissident.   After about a half-hour on Narodni Street, police emerged onboth sides, detained one person and told the others to disperse.Other policemen sealed off the square.   In a statement and in resolutions, the Charter 77 human rightsgroup urged ``the immediate departure of those in the party andstate leadership who are responsible for the brutal actions againstcitizens'' on Friday.   ``The brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrators reminds severalparticipants of the Nazi reprisals 50 years ago,'' Charter 77 said.   ``We call on the public and on political personalities all overthe world to bring pressure to bear on the current Czechoslovakleadership'' to open a dialogue with people outside the CommunistParty.   Czechoslovakia's hard-line leaders, installed after the 1969invasion, have resisted most of the Soviet-inspired reformssweeping Communist neighbors in Eastern Europe.   In a surprise move, however, they granted Havel an exit visaFriday so he can travel to Stockholm this week and receive a humanrights award. Swedish officials had planned to come to Prague togive Havel the prize because they did not expect Havel would beallowed to leave the country.</TEXT></DOC>
