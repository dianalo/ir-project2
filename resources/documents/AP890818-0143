(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Through tears, a grieving foster mothersaid she's determined to keep alive the memory of a 2-year-old sheraised most of his short life so she can prove his death is worthmore than 30 days' pay.   The parents of Bradley McGee are charged with murder. Authoritiessaid the child was repeatedly plunged headfirst into a toilet bowlduring potty training. His July 28 death set off controversythroughout Florida about handling of abuse cases.   The boy might be alive today if social workers had followed theirpolicy for protecting abused children, a state investigatorconcluded.   Four state child care workers knew Brad was subjected to physicalabuse and ``bizarre punishment'' at home, didn't report it andrecommended the child be returned to his parents, the investigatorsaid.   The Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Servicescalled it an error in judgment and disciplined the workers, rangingfrom a written reprimand to 30 days' suspension.   ``A child is dead,'' said Pam Kirkland, who wanted to adopt Brad.``A judgment call results in a preventable death and disciplinaryaction is no more than 30 days without pay? Is that all a child'slife is worth today?''   Mrs. Kirkland spent 14 months caring for Brad while he was underthe protection of HRS.   The boy died with multiple bruises on his face, abdomen, buttocksand groin. But that's not what killed the blond, blue-eyed toddler.   Shoving him untold times headfirst into a toilet bowl did, themedical examiner's office said. His brain hemorrhaged.   Brad's mother, Sheryl McGee Coe, 20, and stepfather, Tom Coe, 22,are accused of killing the boy for soiling his pants. They toldpolice they were potty-training him. Mrs. Coe is expecting her thirdchild later this month. Her second child, a 13-month-old girl, wasplaced in foster care after Bradley's death.   No trial has been scheduled.   Brad had been under the care of HRS since his mother abandonedhim malnourished and congested when he was 4 months old. She lefthim with a stranger, a pretzel vendor, at a mall.   Two months before his death he was returned to his parents.   Pam Kirkland and her husband, Jim, had warned HRS against it. Achild protection team, a group of medical and social workprofessionals that weigh cases for the state, had advised against itin a psychological evaluation of the parents. And on July 3, HRSreceived a report of abuse. The reports were not brought to theattention of a judge who approved the reunification.   Others say they reported problems, but the agency says it onlyhas record of one call to its abuse hot line.   Following an investigation by the HRS inspector general, theagency suspended the caseworker without pay for 30 days, suspendedan administrator without pay for three weeks, reprimanded a programdirector and demoted a supervisor.   Since March 1988, five Tampa Bay area children have died fromchild abuse while under HRS supervision.   ``How many more children will die if nothing is done, and rightaway?'' Mrs. Kirkland asked. She is urging the governor to call aspecial legislative session. The state attorney is investigatinghandling of the case.   Signatures are being collected on 20,000 petitions that ask thegovernor to make it tougher for parents to get their kids back.   Inspector General Jerry Slavens agrees with Mrs. Kirkland andsays the law should be changed ``so that the safety of the childcomes first as opposed to family reunification.''   The first six months Brad was in HRS custody, his parents nevercontacted the agency, according to state reports.   He called the Kirklands ``mommy'' and ``daddy.'' They called him``Brabbee.''   ``He was happy, bright, and a clown. He loved to dance. He'd hearmusic and turn himself around,'' said Mrs. Kirkland, sitting at herdining room table surrounded by pictures of Brad. In every pose, hewas smiling.   ``He was also very sensitive,'' she said. Even a gentle scoldingwould bring tears.   At the Kirklands, Brad rode around in a fenced yard on hisfavorite dump truck. When he was wet, he'd bring a clean diaper toPam to change him. When Kirkland, a teacher, came home from work,he'd race to the door giggling ``daddy home.''   ``He had so much love to give and wanted so much to be loved,''said Mrs. Kirkland, fighting back tears. ``He would cling with hisarms around me.''   On May 24, HRS workers took Brabbee back to the Coes. TheKirklands said they were told they could not see him again becausehe had bonded to them and wasn't bonding to his parents.   Two months later he was dead.   ``What went through that child's mind,'' Mrs. Kirkland wondered.``Was he thinking, `What did I do? Why don't they come get me?' ...And when he was unplugged from that respirator, was there anyonethat loved him there to hug him?''</TEXT></DOC>
