L. 100-690, the Anti-DrugAbuse Act of 1988, establishes the Drug Abuse Education and PreventionProgram for Runaway and Homeless Youth. The specific purposes of this programare to: 1. Provide individual, family, and group counseling to runaway youth andtheir families and to homeless youth for the purpose of preventing or reducingthe illicit use of drugs by such youth; 2. Develop and support peer counseling programs for runaway and homelessyouth related to the illicit use of drugs; 3. Develop and support community education activities related to the illicituse of drugs by runaway and homeless youth, including outreach to individualyouth; 4. Provide runaway and homeless youth in rural areas with assistance (includingthe development of community support groups) related to the illicit useof drugs; 5. Provide information and training regarding issues related to the illicituse of drugs by runaway and homeless youth to individuals involved in providingservices to these youth; 6. Support research on illicit drug use by runaway and homeless youth,the effects on such youth of drug abuse by family members, and any correlationbetween such use and attempts at suicide; and 7. Improve the availability and coordination of local services relatedto drug abuse for runaway and homeless youth. The overall purpose of the Drug Abuse Prevention Program is to assist communitiesto address the problem of drug abuse among runaway and homeless youth throughthe prevention, early intervention, and reduction of drug dependency. OHDSwill suppport service, coordination and demonstration activities designedto achieve the specific purposes identified by andplusmin;1, andplusmin;2,andplusmin;3, andplusmin;4, and andplusmin;7 above. Training and research programsin andplusmin;5 and andplusmin;6 above will be funded separately from thisannouncement. While funds are available for drug treatment referral asa project component, there is no provision in the statute for assistancefor drug treatment services themselves. B. <T3>Definitions: </T3>For the purposes of this program announcement, thefollowing definitions apply: (1) <T3>Drug </T3>means a beverage containing alcohol; a controlled substance;or a controlled substance analogue. (2) <T3>Illicit </T3>means unlawful or injurious. (3) <T3>Community-based </T3>means located within the community and maintainedwith community and consumer participation in the planning, operation, andevaluation of its programs. (4) <T3>Public Agency </T3>means any State, unit of local government, combinationof such States or units, or any agency, department, or instrumentalityof any of the foregoing. (5) <T3>State </T3>means any State of the United States, the District of Columbia,the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands, American Samoa,the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territoryof the Pacific Islands.C. <T3>Background:</T3> Service providers and others working with runawayand homeless youth have traditionally been concerned with the problem ofdrug abuse prevention, reduction, and treatment among this population.The passage of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 is, in part, recognitionthat programs serving runaway and homeless youth have been attempting toaddress the problem. All evidence points to a steady increase in drug useamong this population. While statistics indicate a decrease in the useof marijuana in the 18-25 year old category during the past five years,there has been a marked increase in the use of more dangerous and addictivedrugs such as cocaine and crack over the same period. There has also beenan increase in the abuse of alcohol among younger adolescents. The presenceof alcohol is of particular concern because it is often a ``gateway'' drugto more serious substance abuse. During 1985, 350,000 youth (including many runaway, homeless and streetyouth) were arrested for drug abuse violations and were detained or incarceratedfor drug related offenses. The increase in intravenous drug use poses theadditional hazard of transmitting the AIDS virus through contaminated needles.Statistics also show a strong correlation between drug abuse and youthsuicide. About 37 percent of the youth treated in emergency rooms for drugproblems had attempted suicide. In 85 percent of all completed suicides,drugs and/or alcohol are present. The street life environment of runawayand homeless youth places them at high risk for involvement in the abuseof illicit drugs and the related consequences. The prevalence of this problemis underscored by the fact that not only are major urban area runaway andhomeless youth programs reporting an increase in the use of drugs amongtheir clients, but also that providers in small towns and rural communitiesare finding that up to 67 percent of their clients are reporting drug abuseas a primary presenting problem at intake. The Office of Human Development Services (OHDS) seeks to expand the availabilityof knowledge pertaining to effective drug abuse prevention, particularlyearly intervention methods and service delivery systems for this hard toreach population. All applications should reflect the understanding thatdrug abuse prevention and reduction cannot be addressed in isolation, particularlyin cases where family members, especially parents, are also users of illicitdrugs. Where family members are present, their involvement is stronglyencouraged as an integral part of the services provided. In addition, OHDS encourages awareness of and sensitivity to the particularneeds of ethnic, racial and cultural groups in the prevention of drug abuseamong youth from these communities. Accordingly, Native American youthare a specific focus of this announcement. A recent study by the IndianHealth Service of the Public Health Service, DHHS, entitled <T3>Alcoholism/Substance Abuse Prevention Initiative</T3> points to a disproportionatelyhigh rate of alcohol and illicit drug use (particularly inhalants) amongIndian youth. The report also states that negative peer influence and thedisruption of traditional ties to tribal elders and kinship relations area primary contributor to the increasing abuse of drugs. The Administrationfor Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) has, over time, collaborated withthe Department's Administration for Native Americans in addressing theunique needs of runaway and homeless Indian youth and seeks to continuethat collaboration in the prevention and reduction of drug abuse for thispopulation. The improvement and expansion of direct prevention services and the developmentof community resources and support for runaway and homeless youth are alsoimportant activities of this new program. Section 3511 of the Act providesfor services as well as referrals to drug treatment programs. However,drug treatment itself is not covered, and will not be supported under thisannouncement. Other sections of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 supportthe provision of drug treatment and rehabilitation for the homeless, medicallyindigent, pregnant adolescents, and teen parents. The lack of drug treatmentprograms in many areas of the country will require applicants under thisannouncement to develop innovative approaches to securing appropriate treatmentfor the runaway and homeless youth they serve. This particular type ofresource development is strongly encouraged. In addition, the Family and Youth Services Bureau within OHDS has recentlysigned an Interagency Agreement with the Public Health Service, DHHS, forimproved access to medical services, including drug treatment. The Bureauof Health Care Delivery and Assistance (BHCDA) of the Public Health Service,with funds made available under the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless AssistanceAct of 1987, has recently awarded 109 grants to medical centers acrossthe country to provide primary health care, including drug abuse preventiontreatment, to homeless populations. Applicants may wish to identify individualcenters and, where possible, access this resource. For information, contact:Mr. Harold Dame, BHCDA, Room 7A-22, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland20857, (301) 443-8134. For information concerning the nationwide system of Community and MigrantHealth Centers, applicants may wish to contact the National Clearinghousefor Primary Care Information at (703) 821-8955. As mandated by Section 3511 of the Act, a national training program willbe implemented to provide information, training and technical assistanceon drug abuse related issues to service providers and agencies. In addition,research will also be supported under this new program which will, in part,study the illicit drug use of runaway and homeless youth, the effects onsuch youth of drug abuse by family members, and any correlation betweensuch use and attempts at suicide. These training and research projectswill be implemented separately from this program announcement. However,as grantees under this program implement the specific activities of theirprojects, they will also be expected to work with the national trainingand research contractors to generate new information on the prevalenceof drug abuse, types of drugs used, issues to be addressed, and recommendedapproaches to dealing with the problem. The Federal government is currently supporting numerous activities to preventsubstance abuse and the spread of AIDS among runaway and homeless youth.The Office of Substance Abuse Prevention (OSAP) and the National Instituteof Drug Abuse (NIDA) are sources of information about projects at the localand national levels and on existing prevention materials and program curricula.OHDS encourages applicants to coordinate their proposed activities withprojects supported by OSAP and NIDA, wherever possible and practical, toreduce potential duplication. This collaboration is especially encouragedin activities to address Purposes andplusmin;3, andplusmin;4, and andplusmin;7as listed in Part I, Section A of this announcement. Information relatingto OSAP and NIDA supported projects may be obtained by contacting:<ITAG tagnum="15">Elaine Johnson, Ph.D., Director, Office of Substance Abuse Prevention,Room 9A-40, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857, (301) 468-2600</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Alberto Mata, Ph.D., Community Ethnographer, National Institute onDrug Abuse, Room 10A-46, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857,(301) 443-6720.</ITAG>D. <T3>Eligibility: </T3>Any State, unit of local government (or combinationof units of local government), public or non-profit private agency, organization,institution, or other non-profit entity (including individuals) is eligibleto apply. In instances where more than one agency or individual submita joint application to coordinate activities under this announcement, onelegal entity must be designated as the proposed grantee. As required by section 3511(b) of the Act, priority will be given to applicantsthat have experience in providing services to runaway and homeless youth.Non-profit applicants who have not previously received support from theOffice of Human Development Services must submit proof of their non-profitstatus with their grant application. This can be done either by makingreference to its listing in the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) most recentlist of tax-exempt organizations or by submitting a copy of its letterfrom IRS [IRS Code sections 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(6)]. Non-profit applicantscannot be funded without acceptable proof of this status. Although <T3>for</T3>-profit entities may participate as contractors under grantsto eligible applicants, they do not qualify as applicants under this grantannouncement.Applicants must also indicate in their proposal a willingness to cooperatewith a third party contractor(s) to be funded by ACYF. The contractor(s)will provide training and technical assistance support to grantees andwill conduct program evaluation and research. As a condition of any grant awarded under this announcement, each applicantmust certify compliance with the application requirements of section 3514(b)of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act by signing the assurance form included in theapplication package (see Appendix II). E. <T3>Applicant Share of Project Costs: </T3>A 25 percent non-Federal share,($1 for every $3 of Federal funding), either cash or third party in-kindcontributions, or a combination thereof, secured from non-Federal sources,is required of all projects. For example, an applicant who applies for$75,000 in Federal funding must provide $25,000 toward the project, witha total project cost of $100,000. OHDS encourages applicants to proposegrantee shares which will be met in cash, as opposed to in-kind contributions.Applications that do not provide the 25 percent share will not be considered.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part II: Priority Area Descriptions </ITAG>Applicants are invited to submit proposals that respond to one or moreof the following priority areas: A. Comprehensive Service Projects Approximately 20 to 30 grants will be awarded under this priority areato improve and/or expand existing services related to preventing or reducingthe use of illicit drugs among runaway and homeless youth and their families.In addressing the families of runaway youth, proposals should include amethodology that considers the impact of the drug abuse problem on theimmediate family, extended family and peers that compose the youth's homeenvironment. Applicants must also demonstrate how additional resourceswill be utilized to expand or improve current service delivery throughimproved outreach, counseling (individual, family, group, and peer), intakeand medical screening, referrals to treatment and the provision of aftercareservices. Proposals should show evidence of joint planning with other agenciesin the community towards the development of a comprehensive approach toservice delivery.Where more than one agency joins to submit a single application, lettersof commitment should be included as well as a clearly defined task chartshowing the responsibilities and involvement of the designated agencies.<T3>Duration:</T3> Not to exceed 24 months, with the possibility of renewalfor an additional 12-month period based on the availability of funds andsatisfactory performance of the grantee.<T3>Federal Share of Project Costs:</T3> Up to $150,000 for the initialproject period.B. Community Networking ProjectsApproximately 20 to 30 grants will be awarded under this priority areato encourage the development of community support and resources to ensurethe provision of quality, coordinated drug abuse prevention and reductionefforts in rural areas and in communities with fragmented or minimal servicesfor runaway and homeless youth. Runaway and homeless youth, as well asservice providers, often cite a lack of coordinated services and informationresources as reasons for sustained illicit drug use and difficulty in obtainingtreatment services. This priority area encourages the creation of communityand resource development efforts to address the need for community education,the coordination of existing services for runaway and homeless youth andtheir families, and the creation of community support groups that specificallyaddress the issue of drug abuse among runaway and homeless youth. Applicationsshould identify current barriers to coordinated services, continuum ofcare, and the establishment of successful networks and should propose alternativesto address these barriers. Examples of alternatives which might be undertakenby these networks include the modification of State policies, review ofexisting statutes, adjustment of priorities among other related serviceproviders, expanded use of the media, promulgation of information in languagesand customs indigenous to ethnic communities, and greater use of communityforums. Applications should also clearly demonstrate a model of improvedservice delivery as a result of the better coordination of resources. Proposalsmust show clear evidence of joint planning and defined responsibilities.Applicants must establish a network of providers, with letters of commitmentfrom each, and should propose innovative models for successfully developingand implementing a network of services that can be replicated in othercommunities. Uniform case management practices among all providers is anexample of effective networking as are innovative combinations of services,particularly in geographic areas with minimal resources for runaway andhomeless youth.<T3>Duration:</T3> Not to exceed 24 months, with the possibility of renewalfor an additional 12-month period based on the availability of funds andsatisfactory performance of the grantee.<T3>Federal Share of Project Costs:</T3> Up to $150,000 for the initialproject period.C. Demonstration ProjectsApproximately 10 to 20 grants will be awarded under this priority areato support the development of model approaches for the prevention and reductionof illicit drug use by runaway and homeless youth. OHDS is looking forimproved methods which include, but are not limited to, innovative outreachand referral to treatment programs (e.g., overcoming barriers to treatmentsuch as age limitations, language, local customs, and medical indigence);prevention and treatment services for homeless youth in preparation forindependent living; and models of agency and treatment program collaboration,including utilization of the resources made available through the PublicHealth Service/OHDS Interagency Agreement.OHDS also invites the identification of similar issues which need furtherdevelopment for the effective prevention and reduction of drug abuse. Inaddition to the development of new approaches, these projects should alsogenerate information on the prevalence of drug abuse among runaway andhomeless youth and other information useful to the field. All applicantsunder this priority area must clearly describe the relevance of their proposedproject to increased knowledge and practical information immediately applicableto other service providers. Proposals should demonstrate coordinated approachesto the provision of services through letters of commitment from multi-agencypartners. <T3>Duration:</T3> Not to exceed 17 months, with the possibility of renewalfor an additional 12-month period based on the availability of funds andsatisfactory performance of the grantee. <T3>Federal Share of Project Costs:</T3> Up to $150,000 per year.D. Native American Youth Approximately 10 grants will be awarded under this priority area to supportrunaway and homeless youth programs on/or near Indian reservations andAlaska Native villages. Eligible applicants are Federally recognized IndianTribes/Tribal Entities and Alaska Villages/Non-Profit Regional Corporations.Hawaiian homesteads are also eligible to apply.The problem of illicit drug use (particularly inhalants) among Native Americanrunaway and homeless youth continues to escalate. Proposals should reflectthe development of model approaches to reducing and preventing drug abuseamong this population through outreach, improved and expanded services,educational awareness programs and cultural and ethnic considerations foraddressing the problem. Innovative approaches that attempt to provide follow-upservices, in conjunction with other agencies, to youth who move to or fromthe reservation, village or homestead are strongly encouraged.Applicants should propose projects that:andbullet; Involve the youth, family and community in a comprehensive approachto prevent drug use;andbullet; Focus on activities which relate the youth to Indian Tribal valuesand languages, and which are designed to develop a positive cultural andfamily identity; andandbullet; Demonstrate how the project will complement other existing drugprevention and education programs in the community.Projects should also demonstrate a high potential for replicability inother similar communities.<T3>Duration:</T3> Not to exceed 17 months, with the possibility of renewalfor an additional 12-month period based on the availability of funds andsatisfactory performance of the grantee.<T3>Federal Share of Project Costs:</T3> Up to $75,000 for the initialproject period.<ITAG tagnum="85">Part III: Criteria for Review and Evaluation of Applications</ITAG>An application must meet all of the eligibility requirements specific tothe priority area under which it is being submitted.
