Jesse Jackson released federal tax returns showing total income for himself and his wife, Jacqueline, of $209,358 last year, almost all of it from personal-appearance fees.    The documents said the couple paid $53,019 in federal income taxes, $4,703 in Illinois state income tax and $6,784 in real estate taxes. The Jacksons claimed charitable contributions totaling $2,145 but didn't list the recipients.    The bulk of Mr. Jackson's fees were paid through a personal-services corporation, Personalities International Inc., of which his wife is president and his two sons are directors. Mr. Jackson is the corporation's sole client, a spokesman said. The returns didn't show who paid the fees.    Mr. Jackson, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, also released returns for past years, showing total income of $186,043 in 1986; $187,839 in 1985 and $59,453 in 1984, much of which he spent in an unsuccessful run for that year's nomination. </TEXT></DOC>
