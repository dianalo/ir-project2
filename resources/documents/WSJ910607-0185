Klein</HL><DATE>06/07/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A11</SO><LP>   Chaska, Minn. -- You can say almost anything you wantabout a golfer's home, wife and -- yes -- even his dog, butwatch what you say about his country club. That, basically,is why the U.S. Open golf tournament will be staged beginningThursday at Hazeltine National Golf Club in this communitynear Minneapolis.   They held the Open here once before, in 1970, when thelayout was but eight years old and surrounded by farmsinstead of suburbia, and some of the contestants didn't thinkmuch of it. One was Dave Hill, who expressed himself in nouncertain terms. &quot;Just because you cut the grass and put upflags doesn't mean you have a golf course,&quot; said he. &quot;Whatthis place lacks is 80 acres of corn and a few cows.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Were Hazeltine's members steamed? Hey, they cancelledtheir next barn dance to plot revenge. But seriously folks,they've since spent upwards of $1 million on courserenovations and run up some sizable travel and long-distancephone bills persuading the sponsoring U.S. Golf Associationto give them a second chance.   &quot;We needed this Open to get that Dave Hill thing behindus,&quot; affirms lawyer Reed Mackenzie, a 26-year Hazeltinemember and general chairman of the tourney. &quot;We didn't wantit to be our permanent legacy.&quot;   The upshot is that very little of the golf course thatwill test next week's field will be familiar to people whoplayed in or watched the 1970 tournament. Four holes -- theninth, 16th, 17th and 18th -- are altogether new, and a dozenothers have been altered significantly. And on top of allthat came the necessity of replacing every one of the club's18 greens because of a blight that struck during the winterof 1985-86.   &quot;Awhile back, one of our members made up some golf shirtswith a logo showing a guy with a crazed look driving abulldozer,&quot; Mr. Mackenzie notes. &quot;We almost adopted it as ourofficial crest.&quot;   If the above makes Hazeltine seem unusual, it only adds tosome of the things that went before. The course was built in1962 for the express purpose of holding big-time tourneys,and Robert Trent Jones, the noted golf architect, was hiredto design it. Believing that the sport's technology soonwould make many existing courses obsolete, Mr. Jones puttogether a layout that could only be described as radical,measuring a gargantuan 7,500 yards from the back tees andfeaturing a half-dozen doglegs that were sharper than anyextant.   Also radical in country club circles were Hazeltine'smembership policy, which barred no one on the basis of sex,race or religion, and the attitude that golf was meant to beplayed by people who walked and carried their own bags. Boththe policy and custom survive; Hazeltine has a few electriccarts, but they're used mainly by people with disabilities.   And then there's the &quot;National&quot; in its name, which seemsexcessive in view of the fact that only eight or 10 memberslive outside the immediate area. It's a free country, though,as was proved again when Baker Golf Course, a daily-feeoperation in nearby Medina, Minn., up and changed its name toBaker National.   Hazeltine got itself the '70 Open in record time, at leastpartly because one of its founders was Totton P.Heffelfinger, a former president of the USGA. That event,played at 7,151 yards, would stand out mostly for thecriticisms leveled at the course and a first-day combinationof rain and high winds that would put the opening-roundmedian score at 79. The only player to break par of 288 overthe four days was the winner, Tony Jacklin, an Englishman whofound conditions homey. His 72-hole score of 281 was sevenstrokes better than that of the runner-up, the aforementionedMr. Hill.   To give you a further idea of how tough the course played,Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer, the game's lions of thatperiod, checked in at 304 and 305 strokes, respectively.   Hazeltine's members now agree that, in retrospect, theirlayout probably was too raw for such a major event, and thatmuch of what was said about it was justified. With the helpof Mr. Jones and his son, Rees, they've devoted the last 21years to doing things like straightening doglegs, moving teesand recontouring greens, and nature has done its bit byegging on the 1,600 trees on the property. Throw in a wetspring that's greened things over nicely, and you have aquite presentable package. &quot;If you'd never heard of itbefore, you'd think the course looked pretty decent,&quot; saysMr. Mackenzie, and he's correct.   The revamped Hazeltine measures 7,149 yards, and even withits edges smoothed will present problems to the Open field.Its par fives measure 580, 518, 556 and 590 yards -- long byany standard -- and water comes into play on three of itsfour par threes. The USGA says the rough will measure fiveinches, an inch higher than in the last few Opens, and if thewind blows at a goodly clip, as it often does this time ofyear, par will once again be a challenge.   Three holes especially could help shape the outcome. Theseventh is a 518-yard par five dogleg right with a largemound to the right of the green and a pond to the left. It'sbirdieable, but the green is difficult to hold with a longiron, and a ball that's miss-hit to the left will get wet.   The 16th hole is a picturesque, 384-yard par four wherethe tee shot must carry 200 yards of water to a landing areabordered by a creek, and the green is a narrow peninsulajutting into Lake Hazeltine. Any errant shot, in anydirection, gets wet.   No. 17 is a 182-yard par three that's usually played intothe wind to an elevated green guarded by traps on the rightand a pond on the left. Reaching the green in one won'tensure a par, because it's a two-tiered affair that's ratedthe toughest on the course.   Mike Schultz, the club pro, believes that the weather willpretty much determine the winner's score. &quot;With little or nowind, someone could come in under 280 strokes, and a scorebetween 281 and 283 seems likely under normal conditions,&quot; hesays.   And if a gale whips up, a la 1970? &quot;You can bet thatthere'll be a few Dave Hill impersonations,&quot; he smiles.</TEXT></DOC>
