My friends aredead inside!''   She was among hundreds of students and teachers inside theChristian College of the Philippines when an earthquake struck atabout 4:30 p.m. on Monday, toppling the six-story building in thiscity of 80,000 residents. The school included first grade throughthe senior year of college.   The quake measured 7.7 on the Richter scale and was centerednear Cabanatuan City, 60 miles north of Manila. It was thestrongest earthquake to hit the Philippines in 14 years, andseismological officials said Cabanatuan had not had a major quakesince 1645.   Early Tuesday, hospitals said 35 people had been killed in theCabanatuan area and 154 injured. Most casualties were from theschool but officials had no accurate breakdown.   Officials admitted they had no idea how many were in thebuilding when it collapsed. Mayor Honorato Perez said Tuesday about50 people remained buried in the rubble but fewer than half werebelieved still alive.   Rescue efforts were undertaken largely by townspeople whoflocked to the site and volunteered their services. There waslittle sign of experienced supervision.   President Corazon Aquino flew to Cabanatuan from Manila earlyTuesday to console families and visit survivors. Gov. Bren Guiao ofPampanga province said Mrs. Aquino gave the families money and toldthem ``It's already happened. Leave it to God.''   As she met, a rescuer crawled from the rubble and told reportershe found four boys, all alive. But he said one was pinned under theruins, in such pain he amputated his own leg with a jagged piece ofconcrete.   Poorly equipped local hospitals overflowed with victims.Patients were placed on cots in yards in front of clinics.   Lt. Benbol Moralde, part of an army contingent sent from nearbyFort Magsaysay, said he believed few remained alive beneath thedebris.   Moralde said victims' cries grew fainter and fainter and that hecould see bodies and parts of bodies when he surveyed thedestruction.   Hours after the temblor, hundreds of family members and friendswatched and prayed as rescuers dug through the school rubble.   Each time someone was brought out alive, relatives crowdedaround the survivor, begging for news of those still missing.   ``They told me she's still alive,'' said Rosa de los Reyes, whowas waiting word of her daughter, Maria Lisa, 14. ``I'm very happybut if it turns out she has died, I think I'm going to die too.''   Throughout the night, boys as young as seven scrambled betweenslabs of concrete carrying water to victims still trapped.Sixteen-year-old Florencio Alano crawled through the wreckagelooking for his 13-year-old brother, Cesario _ only to find out hewas dead.   Florencio, who eventually led three survivors to safety, said:``At first I couldn't believe that he was already dead. So Icrawled through the passageway. I saw his face and felt him. Whatelse can one feel but just accept it.''   Rescuers could hear the anguished screams during the night ofthose buried under tons of debris. Most begged for water. One girlshrieked for rescuers to ``cut off my legs'' to free her.   Miss Gabwat, a high school sophomore, said her class had justfinished a math examination when the quake struck.   ``We were kidding each other, we were saying the test was soeasy,'' Miss Gabwat said as she rode in an ambulance to theprovincial hospital. ``Then suddenly, the walls trembled, theceiling collapsed and there was total darkness. We embraced eachother. We were very scared.''   She said survivors groped for one another in the darkened rubbleand prayed aloud.   ``We were calling out our classmates' names but they did notrespond any more,'' she said. ``Then we groped for their hands butfelt that they were cold. Each time, we wept.   ``We were scared and some were screaming. But then later on,they said they wanted to sleep already and rest. Then there wassilence.''   Cenando Memping, whose 14th birthday was on Monday, said he hadjust invited his three best friends to join him after class at arestaurant when the quake hit.   Cenando and his friends were trapped beneath tons of rubble. Hesaid there were 54 students in his class. More than 10 hours afterthe quake, he was the only one of them who had been rescued.   ``I prayed to God that if I survive, I'll hear Mass every day,''he said from his hospital bed. He said his friend Michael Nuevojoked that he would never go to a ``high'' school again.   Moments later, Michael died, Cenando said.   ``We were kidding each other, comforting each other,'' Cenandosaid softly. ``Then suddenly, he stopped breathing. He said,`Praise the Lord. Our Father, Our Father, Our Father.' Then he wassilent.''</TEXT></DOC>
