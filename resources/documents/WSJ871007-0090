The utility said it hired Douglas R. Gipson, 40 years old, to head the plant. Mr. Gipson had been assistant manager of the River Bend nuclear facility of Beaumont, Texas-based Gulf States Utilities Co.    Mr.Gipson succeeds William S. Orser, 43, who was named to the job in late July as part of a management shuffle at the utility's nuclear operations.    Mr. Orser, who joined Detroit Edison in January from Portland General Electric Co., will continue in the post of vice president of nuclear operations.    Fermi 2 has never operated commercially, and it has missed several target dates. The plant's costs, meanwhile, have climbed to more than $4.43 billion.    Many of the plant's problems -- including safety-related incidents -- have stemmed from repeated mistakes by operators and mismanagement by supervisors. Just last month, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission proposed fining Detroit Edison $75,000 for a June incident in which a plant operator temporarily allowed cooling water to overheat. The NRC also said the utility didn't have proper safety equipment to handle any resulting emergency. The NRC complained in a letter to Detroit Edison that supervision wasn't adequate; the utility agreed to pay the fine.    In July, Detroit Edison fired one employee and disciplined four others in connection with the incident, and later named Mr. Orser as the plant's general manager, succeeding Robert S. Lenart, who became general director of nuclear engineering.    A Detroit Edison spokesman said although Mr. Orser's appointment as Fermi 2 manager wasn't an interim arrangement, &quot;Since then we have had the opportunity to hire (Mr.) Gipson, who has the qualifications we had been looking for.&quot; The spokesman said Mr. Orser had been handling responsibilities previously held by two officials. </TEXT></DOC>
