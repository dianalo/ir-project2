The government said shelling in Kabul killed 12 people andwounded 35, though two doctors at a hospital that monitorscasualties said they did not know of any victims.   The U.S.-backed guerrillas also shelled a strategic town nearthe Pakistan border, killing nine people, the government said.   Diplomatic sources in Kabul and Islamabad, Pakistan, said it wasthe largest Soviet airlift since February, when Soviet troops endedtheir nine-year intervention in Afghanistan.   Diplomats in Kabul said Soviet-built Antonov-12 transport planeswere flying continuously into the airport, dropping off weapons andfood for soldiers. They said the planes were also flying nightmissions.   Two soldiers said all commercial traffic was shut down for mostof the afternoon but Soviet transport planes were operating despitethe shelling. Witnesses said at least five rockets hit the airportgrounds, but there were no immediate casualty or damage reportsthere.   U.S. Rep. Don Ritter, R-Pa., estimated Moscow has increased itsaid to $400 millinagers to take earlyretirement.   ATandamp;T outperformed its Bell offspring, which reported divergingresults. Profits rose 6.5 percent at Philadelphia-based BellAtlantic Corp., but fell 8.9 percent at Denver-based U S West Inc.,fell 12.6 percent at San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis Group, andfell 14.8 percent at strikebound Nynex Corp., based in WhitePlains, N.Y.   While ATandamp;T said it is not aiming to eliminate a specified numberof jobs, spokesman Burke Stinson said, ``It would not beunreasonable for 5,000 to 15,000 managers to take advantage of theplan.''   Analysts praised ATandamp;T's cost-cutting step, saying the companyhas too many managers in light of its sluggish sales of computersand network equipment.   ``They're doing exactly what I think they need to do,'' said LapLee, a Salomon Brothers Inc. analyst.   ATandamp;T will double to 34,000 the number of managers eligible toretire with immediate pension payments. It is also offering aspecial sweetened pension plan for managers who choose to retire onDec. 30.   ATandamp;T embarked on an aggressive cost-cutting program beginning in1984, the year it lost its local operating companies in the breakupof the Bell System.   Since then the company has cut its payroll from 373,000 to298,000. This is the first program aimed only at managers.   The largest single job cut in the company's history came in late1986, when ATandamp;T eliminated 32,000 jobs. The company has relied onincentives when slashing employment, but Stinson noted that this isthe first ``pension sweetener'' in ATandamp;T history.   ``We are in a topsy-turvy marketplace, and we need to have asmany people at the elbows of our customers as possible and as fewpeople in non-sales, behind-the-scenes jobs as possible,'' Stinsonsaid.   The retirement option will increase expenses in the fourthquarter, but the amount cannot be determined until the number ofparticipants is determined. The company said the higher expenseswould be offset by other items, including a gain from a shareexchange that ends its direct investment in Ing. C. Olivetti andamp; Co.SpA.   ATandamp;T reported profits rose 19 percent to $699 million, or 65cents a share in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $587 million, or55 cents a share a year ago. Revenue increased 1 percent to $8.9billion from $8.81 billion in the third quarter a year ago.   For the nine-month period, profit totaled $1.99 billion, or$1.85 a share, up 19 percent from $1.67 billion, or $1.56 a share,a year ago. Revenue increased 3 percent to $26.81 billion, from$26.00 billion in the year-ago period.   ATandamp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen said that while the company ispleased with the results, ``we are keenly aware that we face stiffcompetition in all our markets.''   He said ATandamp;T will ``continue to be aggressive in the marketingof our products and services, and aggressive as well in continuingto drive costs out of every part of our business.''   Bell Atlantic and U S West, two of the companies carved out ofATandamp;T in the 1984 breakup, reported differing results. Bell Atlanticattributed its gains partly to strong growth in telephone usage,while U S West said its profit dip was the result of specialfactors that masked ``modest earnings growth.''   Bell Atlantic said its profit rose to $363.2 million, or $1.82 ashare, from $341 million, or $1.72 a share, a year earlier. Revenuerose to $2.91 billion from $2.76 billion.   For the first nine months, Bell Atlantic said profit rose to$1.07 billion, or $5.43 a share, from $1.01 billion, or $5.12 ashare, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $8.56 billion from $8.11billion.   U S West said profit fell to $258.1 million, or $1.39 a share,from $283.2 million, or $1.55 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fellto $2.32 billion from $2.43 billion.   ``Nevertheless, we're not satisfied with these results. Themajor negative factor is the cumulative impact of regulatoryactivity over the past two years on our telephone operations,''said Jack McAllister, U S West's chairman and chief executive.   For the year to date, U S West said earnings fell to $766.3million, or $4.17 a share, from $860 million, or $4.68 a share, ayear earlier. Revenue rose to $7.15 billion from $6.87 billion ayear earlier.   Nynex blamed a continuing strike by about 60,000 employees as afactor in its downturn in its installation of phone lines anddelays in repairs and directory assistance. It said itsthird-quarter earnings fell to $288.7 million, or $1.47 a share,from $338.9 million, or $1.72 a share, a year earlier. Revenue roseto $3.31 billion from $3.18 billion a year earlier.   For the first nine months, Nynex earnings fell to $851.3million, or $4.32 a share, from $972 million, or $4.90 a share, ayear earlier. Revenue rose to $9.84 billion from $9.42 billion.   Pacific Telesis Group said earnings fell to $278 million, or 68cents a share, from $318 million, or 75 cents a share, in the thirdquarter of 1988, which had been the best third quarter in thecompany's history. Revenue edged down to $2.37 billion from $2.38billion.   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Pacific Telesissaid earnings fell to $920 million, or $2.23 a share, from $939million, or $2.22 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $7.12billion from $7.06 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
