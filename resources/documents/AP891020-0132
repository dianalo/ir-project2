Under an amendment approved by the Senate, the use of federalfunds would have been prohibited for counting illegal aliens forthe purpose of congressional reapportionment.   A House-Senate conference committee, however, voted Thursday todrop the Senate amendment when it approved appropriations for thejudiciary and the Commerce, State and Justice departments.   States with large numbers of illegal aliens such as Texas,California and Florida could gain new congressional seats as aresult of the decision.   Inclusion of illegal aliens in the count has been stronglyopposed by legislators with few of those residents who fear loss ofinfluence in Congress.   ``The outcome was never in doubt because the Constitution couldnot be clearer. The Constitution says that apportionment is basedon the number of persons and everybody is entitled to their ownopinion, but not their own constitution,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm,R-Texas, a member of the conference committee.   Illegal aliens have always been counted in the census because ofthe requirement to include all persons living in the country.Census Bureau officials have pointed out that they would have noway to exclude illegal aliens, since citizenship is not asked inthe national head count.   The issue of counting illegal aliens has pitted Sun Belt states,whose populations have been swollen by illegal aliens, againstFrostbelt states that stand to lose House seats after the census.</TEXT></DOC>
