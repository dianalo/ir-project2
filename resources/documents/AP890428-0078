The driver was badly burned, but no other injuries were reported.   In the West Bank, masked attackers shot and killed a Palestinianin the crowded main square in Nablus. Arab reports said the victimwas accused of collaborating with Israel.   Eleven other Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes witharmy troops and Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank and GazaStrip, according to the Arab reports.   The army confirmed the incident in Nablus but said it wasinvestigating the circumstances. Military spokesmen said the armywas checking reports of other injuries.   Police spokesman Uzi Sandori said police believe the sedan thatburst into flames and blew up was to have been used in a car bombattack but went off prematurely. The driver was holding adetonator, and there were six tins of kerosene and two cooking gascanisters in the trunk, Sandori said.   ``We believe it might be a terrorist act that failed because ofthe things we found in the car,'' the spokesman said.   Sandori said the driver, identified only as a Palestinian fromArab east Jerusalem, has a criminal record for disturbing thepeace. He was reported in serious condition in Hadassah Hospital.   Officials said the fire that preceded the blast apparently wascaused by cooking gas leaking from the canisters in the trunk, butSandori said the fire began in the gas tank.   A witness said the blast occurred as the driver switched on theignition.   ``Exactly as he switched it the car exploded. It wasn't a loudexplosion. The whole car went up in flames,'' Aryeh Shapira, whowas passing the area on his motorcycle, said on Israel radio.   In the West Bank, the center of the city of Hebron was declareda closed military area after clashes between soldiers andstone-throwing Palestinians, Israel radio said.   Two Palestinians were wounded when soldiers opened fire onstone-throwers, the radio said.   Arab reporters said Jewish settlers in Hebron shot a 14-year-oldboy in the head. The victim, Nader Mohammed Abu Hamdia, wasreported in serious condition at Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital.   In Nablus, masked attackers shot 38-year-old Kamel Abu Samt inthe head and in the mouth, Arab reports said. He died later inIttihad Hospital. The reports said Abu Samt was accused ofcollaborating with Israeli authorities.   A Palestinian was wounded in a clash with soldiers in Nablus,and seven residents of the Gaza Strip were shot and wounded inother confrontations with troops, Arab reports said.   The violence broke out as Arabs in Gaza launched a three-daycommercial strike to protest the death of a 16-year-old killedWednesday in Gaza City's Sabra quarter.   The slain youth was a member of the underground of the Moslemfundamentalist movement Hamas, or ``Zeal,'' Arab reports said.   At least 455 Palestinians have been reported killed in theuprising against Israeli occupation. Eighteeen Israelis have died.   Israel radio said, meanwhile, that an army investigation of adeadly raid by troops in an Arab village April 13 showed thatborder patrol troops used ``exaggerated'' gunfire to quell Arabresistance.   Five Palestinians were shot to death and at least 15 werewounded in what was one of the worst clashes of the uprising.   The report on the West Bank village of Nahalin, given to Chiefof Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron on Thursday, showed the 25paramilitary police fired 150 live bullets during the clash, theradio said.</TEXT></DOC>
