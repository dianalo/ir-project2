The text ofthe report was seen in Bangkok on Saturday. ``Their major divisionsand regiments have fled to Battambang and to the east. No one isdefending Route 10.''   Route 10 links the gem-rich town of Pailin, near the Thaiborder, to Battambang, about 40 miles away. The Khmer Rouge on Oct.22 captured Pailin and said they were pushing northeast toBattambang, a provincial capital.   Claims by the Khmer Rouge are widely regarded as exaggerated,but Thai officials have confirmed the seizure of Pailin.   In the past, the Cambodian government media quickly counteredKhmer Rouge claims, but they have not commented on Pailin.Government radio on Friday claimed one division ``strengthened itsfoothold'' and recently beat back guerrilla infiltrators, killing30 of them.   Battambang is about 50 miles east of the Thai border and 160miles northwest of the capital, Pnom Penh.   The capture of Battambang would be the biggest guerrilla victoryof the 11-year-old war.   The Khmer Rouge is the largest member of the three-partyguerrilla coalition fighting the government Vietnam installed afterinvading in 1978 to topple a Khmer Rouge government.   During the three years the Khmer Rouge ruled the country,hundreds of thousands of Cambodia's 8 million people died fromexecutions, famine and civil unrest.   Vietnam claims it withdrew its last troops from Cambodia inSeptember, but the guerrillas say it has left behind thousands ofsoldiers disguised in Cambodian government units.   The two non-Communist guerrilla groups, the Khmer People'sNational Liberation Front and the forces of Prince NorodomSihanouk, have made significant advances north of Pailin since theVietnamese pullout.   The Sihanouk forces are advancing on Samrong in Oddar Meancheyprovince while the Liberation Front army is heading toward SveyChek, the only big town blocking their advance to the militarycenter of Sisophon.</TEXT></DOC>
