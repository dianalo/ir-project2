First Nationwide Bank, San Francisco, acquired Lincoln Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association of Louisville, Louisville, Ky., in exchange for regulatory approval to expand its branch operations into Maryland and Virginia, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said.    This is the third time that First Nationwide, a thrift unit of Ford Motor Co. with assets of $14 billion, has used a new Bank Board regulation designed to attract buyers of struggling thrifts.    Lincoln Federal was a mutual association with assets of $471.2 million.    To facilitate the transaction, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. will provide First Nationwide with an undisclosed amount of cash. In addition, FSLIC will insure First Nationwide against certain liabilities and litigation that may result from the purchase.    The Bank Board has begun giving thrifts that acquire troubled institutions the right to expand into as many as three states in addition to those in which they currently operate.    Last June, First Nationwide acquired two Ohio thrifts in exchange for the rights to operate branches in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Colorado. Last week, it bought a Missouri Sandamp;L in exchange for branching rights in Illinois, Michigan and New Jersey.    Yesterday's transaction brings to 14 the number of states in which First Nationwide has approval to operate.    Meanwhile, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. agreed to assist in the purchase of Bank of Kansas City, Kansas City, Mo., by Merchants Bank, also of Kansas City. The FDIC acted after Missouri banking authorities notified agency officials that Bank of Kansas City was in danger of failing.    Bank of Kansas City's four offices will operate as branches of Merchants and all customers will be provided with uninterrupted service, the FDIC said. Bank of Kansas City had assets of $118.8 million and deposits of $108.2 million.    The FDIC's assistance will consist of $1 million to offset Bank of Kansas City's capital deficit and a guarantee for certain assets and unfunded letters of credit totaling about $32 million.    The FDIC generally assists the buyer of a failed bank but will approve transactions involving institutions that haven't yet closed if officials believe it will be less costly. This was the sixth assisted purchase of a bank this year. </TEXT></DOC>
