Ethylene is currently derived from petroleum. Proven technology also exists to convert methane into methanol and then to ethylene and other chemical feedstocks. But the multiple-stage process is expensive.    Jack H. Lunsford, a physical chemist, told a meeting of the American Chemical Society here that he and colleagues at Texas Aandamp;M University developed a lithium-magnesium oxide catalyst that can convert methane into ethylene and other chemicals on a commercial scale.    Ethylene has been in short supply recently because of increased demand, especially for export. With manufacturers working at maximum capacity, ethylene's price has nearly doubled in about a year. Mr. Lunsford said industrial-scale production of ethylene from methane would ease the pressure on petroleum reserves.    Dow Chemical Co., one of the largest U.S. manufacturers of ethylene, said it &quot;was quite interested&quot; in processes to convert methane into ethylene, and is conducting its own research in the area. &quot;But we don't think we are quite there yet to commit resources for commercial production,&quot; a spokeswoman said.    She said the company didn't have enough details on Texas Aandamp;M's research to comment on the process it describes. &quot;We do, however, think (the process) is quite promising,&quot;she said.    Dow Chemical said another disincentive to pursue methane at this time is the low price of crude oil. &quot;Right now we have easily available alternative sources for feedstock for ethlyene,&quot; the spokeswoman said.    John Saunby, director of research and development for Union Carbide Corp., said he was familiar with Texas Aandamp;M's process and didn't consider it &quot;practical&quot; for commercialization. But he said industrial production of ethylene from methane will &quot;become a reality within five years.&quot; He said Union Carbide also has developed catalysts that &quot;look pretty good&quot; for transforming methane into ethylene but aren't efficient enough for commercial use. </TEXT></DOC>
