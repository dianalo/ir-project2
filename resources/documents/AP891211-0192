The Institute for International Economics said that, contrary tosome arguments, the growth of foreign ownership has not translatedinto a loss of jobs for Americans and that foreign-owned firms paidtheir U.S. workers the same as domestic firms.   The institute argued against changing any U.S. laws to blockforeign investment, saying that even in the area of nationalsecurity the growth of foreign ownership was not of concern.   ``Even with the recent growth in foreign ownership, foreignfirms play a smaller role in the U.S. economy than in the Canadianand major European economies,'' wrote the authors of the report,Paul Krugman, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Instituteof Technology, and Edwin M. Graham, a business professor at DukeUniversity.   The study said that foreign firms accounted for 7 percent oftotal U.S. employment in manufacturing in 1986 compared to 21percent in France, 14 percent in Britain and 13 percent in WestGermany. By contrast, foreign-owned firms employed only 1 percentof manufacturing workers in Japan, a country with a tradition ofmaking foreign investment difficult.   ``If one country invests heavily in another country, whichcountry has given the most hostages?'' Krugman asked at a newsconference where the report was released. ``Japan is going to findthat it has a very great stake in what the U.S. government decideswhen it discovers that it has a rather large part of its nationalwealth invested inside the U.S. borders.''   The new report, ``Foreign Direct Investment in the UnitedStates,'' analyzed the rapid growth in foreign direct investment.To count as foreign ownership, the foreign firm must own at least10 percent of a U.S. business.   The heavy purchases by foreigners, in particular the Japanese,have triggered concern in Congress and elsewhere that the UnitedStates is selling off its economic destiny to foreigners.   The Commerce Department reported that foreign direct investmentin U.S. real estate and businesses totaled $328.9 billion in 1988,the first year that foreign direct ownership in the United Statessurpassed U.S. ownership overseas, which totaled $326.9 billion.   While Britain continued as the country with the largest stake inthe United States, holding 31 percent of total foreign-held assets,Japan climbed into the No. 2 spot with 16.2 percent of the total,ahead of the Netherlands, which held 14.9 percent.   While purchases of prime real estate and Hollywood movie studiosby the Japanese grabbed the headlines, the most dramatic inroads bythe Japanese have come in banking, according to the institute'sstudy.   It reported that the Japanese in 1988 controlled 52.2 percent ofthe U.S. banking assets held by foreign banks, far ahead of thesecond biggest foreign holder, Canada, which controls 7.1 percent.   The institute said that growing foreign leadership inhigh-technology industries posed new problems in meeting U.S.military needs. As a partial solution, the study proposed making itmandatory for foreign companies making sales to the Pentagon toestablish manufacturing plants in the United States.   The Institute for International Economics is a non-profitresearch institute created in 1981 through a grant from the GermanMarshall Fund of the United States, an independent endowmentcreated by the West German government. It now receives 15 percentof its funds from the German Marshall Fund with other resourcescoming from U.S. foundations including the Ford Foundation and theWilliam and Flora Hewlitt Foundation.</TEXT></DOC>
