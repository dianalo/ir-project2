Terms weren't disclosed.    The contract provides natural gas for use in Florida power plants. Enron said that Citrus will use the natural gas to satisfy about one-fourth of a long-term contract it signed last year with Florida Power andamp; Light Co., a unit of FPL Group Inc. of Miami.    The gas will be bought by Panhandle from Sonatrach, the national oil and gas company of Algeria, and received, stored and re-gasified at Panhandle's Trunkline plant near Lake Charles, La. The terminal, the largest liquefied natural-gas storage facility in the nation, has been idle since 1983 when a contract dispute with the Algerians suspended purchases. </TEXT></DOC>
