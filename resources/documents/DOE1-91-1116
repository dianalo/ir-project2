It consists of a fluidized bed ofmonosized activated carbon coated with flocculent biomass. As the biomassgrows, the product adsorbs, thus reducing inhibition, and the particlemoves upwards to keep the bed properly stratified. Particles removedfrom the top of the bed are treated to remove product and excess biomassand then recycled. A mathematical model shows that the amount of biomasson the recycled carbon is a critical parameter, and that a compromiseis required between volumetric productivity and bed stratification. Experimentsin a laboratory-scale bioreactor are conducted for the production ofethanol (using a flocculent strain of Zymomonas mobilis) and for theproduction of lactic acid (using a mutant strain of Streptococcus thermophilus).The results from the ethanol experiments show that the bed does stratifybut that gas bubbles tend to strip biomass from the particle. In thecase of lactic acid production, the results of the experiment confirmthat the reactor works and show that it performed even better than expected.The theoretical and experimental results are presented and discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
