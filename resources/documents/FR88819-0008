The Commission intends to havethe appropriate regulation to fulfill the requirements of the NWPA in placein a timely manner.

The comment periodexpired on August 25, 1986. The NRC received 195 comment letters from utilities, engineering companies,State offices, environmental groups, private citizens, and a member ofthe U.S. House of Representatives. The comment letters from private citizensnumbered about 145. (Some of these were signed by several individuals orwere submitted on behalf of private business firms.) From the comment lettersreceived, the staff identified 27 separate topics to which specific responseswere directed. Comments were also received which addressed the originalrule, not the proposed amendment. In response to the comments, severalchanges have been made to the proposed rule. The majority of these changesare mainly clarifying in nature. In order to provide sufficient space to accommodate possible future amendmentsto Part 72, the sections of the final rule have been renumbered. To aidthe reader in following the discussion of comments in the preamble of thefinal rule, each reference to a specific section of the final rule is followedby a bracketed reference to the parallel section of the proposed rule.A compilation of the issues raised as a result of public comment and theaccompanying Commission response follow: 1. Backfitting <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters indicated that the proposed rule shouldincorporate the sense of the reactor backfitting rule set out in 10 CFR50.109. <T3>Response: </T3>Although these storage facilities are not like reactorsbut are, for the most part, static by nature with very little need fordesign changes, the staff has revised the backfitting requirements of 10CFR 72.62 (andSection;72.42). The change is being made to conform andSection;72.62(andSection;72.42) more closely to andSection;50.109 as modified by the courtdecision in <T3>Union of Concerned Scientists, et al., </T3>v. <T3>U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, et al., </T3>Nos. 85-1757 and 86-1219,824 F.2d 108 (U.S.C.A.D.C. August 4, 1987). 2. Opportunity for Hearing Prior to the First Receipt of Spent Fuel orHigh-Level Radioactive Waste (HLW) <T3>Comment</T3>: A new proposed andSection; 72.46(c) (andSection; 72.34(c))was added to 10 CFR Part 72 specifically providing that the Commissionmay, upon its own initiative, issue a notice of opportunity for hearingprior to the first receipt of spent fuel or high-level radio-active wasteat an MRS if it finds this to be in the public interest. In the supplementaryinformation in the May 27, 1986 Proposed Rule, the Commission indicatedits own considerations on this topic and expressed particular interestin receiving public comment on (1) the need to make a finding before MRSoperation that construction conforms to the license application, (2) provisionsfor second stage hearing rights to address specific new issues which couldnot have been litigated at the first stage and/or new information whichhas been revealed since issuance of the license, and (3) the format ofthe hearing, if held. Of the comment letters that addressed these points,some expressed no preference, some favored the provisions, some thoughtthe provisions were unnecessary. The principal reasons given by proponents of these provisions are thatthe public will have more confidence that the MRS will be operated safelyand that there should be a clear opportunity to examine new issues whichcould be raised. Other comments of proponents were that the Departmentof Energy has had poor public performance in the past, that the degreeof hazard is similar to nuclear power reactors which require a two-stageprocess, and that the opportunity for a second hearing could be an appropriatetime to examine technical/financial information. Additional comments suggestedthat the rule require a second mandatory hearing and that funding be providedfor nonprofit groups to participate in a second hearing. On the topic of a finding it was suggested that (1) criteria be set forthfor any finding the Commission may make, and (2) the NRC inspections shouldcertify quality assurance and completeness of construction in an inspectionreport prior to initiation of operation. One comment suggested that start-upof the MRS should be linked to the repository authorization as an issueat a second hearing. The principal reasons given by those opposed to the new provisions fora second hearing were that (1) it would cause unnecessary delay, (2) theCommission's regulations in 10 CFR Part 2 were sufficient to examine anynew issues, (3) the NRC's normal systematic inspections are adequate toassure that construction was proper, (4) the nature of the MRS is suchthat all issues could be covered by the opportunity for public review priorto issuing a license and starting construction, and (5) the backfittingprovision (andSection; 72.62 (andSection; 72.42)) provides additional assurancethat significant issues may be raised by staff after the license is issued.Other reasons offered in objection to the new provisions were that (6)there was no basic difference between an MRS and an Independent Spent FuelStorage Installation (ISFSI), (7) the small amount of solidified high-levelwaste which could be received could not justify any change in procedurefrom an ISFSI, and (8) the Safety Analysis Report (SAR) update procedurewill assure that any new issue will be known and understood by NRC staff.<T3>Response</T3>: The Commission specifically added the new provisionand requested comments in order to obtain as complete an understandingas possible of whether or not any benefits would accrue to the public fromsuch a procedure. This was done with full knowledge that the Atomic EnergyAct of 1954, as amended, only requires one hearing and that under the proceduresin 10 CFR Part 2 the opportunity always exists for any member of the publicto bring any new issues to the Commission's attention. In the comments received from the public there was no indication that therewere likely to be any new safety issues brought forward which could nothave been fully addressed on the occasion of the hearing held prior toissuance of the license. The licensing process of Part 72 supports one-stagelicensing as it requires that all information needed for the licensingaction be available and complete before a license is issued, i.e., finaldesign, quality assurance/control procedures, operator training procedures,operating technical specifications, etc. Unlike a reactor license wherea construction permit is issued prior to final design, an MRS applicationfor license contains a final and complete design and therefore one-stagelicensing is achievable. As to conformance of construction with the applicationand license, the Commission believes that, unlike reactors, constructionof Part 72 type facilities will be simple and straightforward. Accordingly,in the Commission's judgment, there will be no need, as part of the safetyreview prior to license issuance, to require an applicant to ``prove''conformance of the as-built facility with the application. NRC would auditconstruction progress and, in the event some problems were found, enforcementaction could be taken to correct them and, if necessary, halt the receiptof spent fuel until they were corrected. In this regard, andSection; 72.82(c)(3)(andSection; 72.56(c)(3)) provides for establishing an NRC resident inspectionprogram if warranted. 3. Interaction with States <T3>Comment</T3>: Comments were received concerning providing of informationto State and local governments and their interaction in the licensing processwith DOE and the Commission. <T3>Response</T3>: Under andSection; 72.200 (andSection; 72.310) of the proposedrule, the Governor and legislature of any State in which a monitored retrievablestorage installation may be located and the governing body of any affectedIndian tribe will be provided timely and complete information regardingdeterminations or plans made by the Commission with respect to siting,development, design, licensing, construction, operation, regulation ordecommissioning of such monitored retrievable storage facility. In responseto the comment, the Commission will change andSection; 72.200 (andSection;72.310) ``Provision of MRS Information'' to require that the above informationwill also be provided to each affected unit of local government and tothe Governors of any contiguous States. The definition of ``affected unitof local government'' which has been added to andSection; 72.3 tracks thedefinition used in the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987. (Sec.5002, Pub. L. 100-203, 101 Stat. 1330-227 (42 U.S.C. 10101 (31)).) Participationby persons, including States, in license reviews is as provided for in10 CFR Part 2, Subpart G. 4. High Burn-Up Fuel <T3>Comment</T3>: In response to a 1980 petition for rulemaking, the Commissionagreed (51 FR 23233, June 26, 1986) to prepare an environmental assessmenton high burn-up fuel. The Commission's response concerning impacts of highburn-up fuel should be provided. <T3>Response</T3>: The Commission issued an environmental assessment addressingthe subject of high burn-up fuel in February 1988 ``Assessment of the Useof Extended Burnup Fuel in Light Water Power Reactors'' (NUREG/CR-5009).The assessment concluded ``Environmentally, this burnup increase wouldhave no significant impact over normal burnup.'' 5. Emergency Planning <T3>Comment</T3>: As discussed in supplementary information to the proposedrevisions to 10 CFR Part 72 the rule was rewritten to set forth explicitrequirements appropriate to an ISFSI or an MRS, rather than refer to AppendixE to CFR Part 50, which is specific to nuclear power reactors. Responderscommented on this change. Several thought that there should be a widerdissemination of the emergency plan which an applicant would have to preparepursuant to the rewritten andSection; 72.32 (andSection; 72.19), as well asa comment period longer than the specified 60 days. Another responder thoughtthat 60 days was adequate. Other comments were that (1) sabotage of casksand terrorism, sabotage and military attack scenarios should be consideredin an emergency plan, (2) a fully developed and tested offsite emergencyplan should be developed, (3) the new version of andSection; 72.32 (andSection;72.19) implies a need for offsite protective actions which is incorrect,(4) the supplementary information which will accompany the issuance ofthe final rule should discuss worldwide experience and previous reviewsand studies as support for the new emergency planning provisions, and (5)the emergency plan should continue to be the same as that for nuclear powerreactors.<T3>Response:</T3> The basic concept of emergency planning in andSection;72.32 (andSection; 72.19) has not been changed. None of the respondents providedany additional information to the staff or questioned the staff analysessuch as to change the basis for the staff's approach to emergency planningfor an ISFSI or an MRS. Moreover, in view of the relatively passive natureof facilities for the receipt, handling and storage of spent fuel and high-levelradioactive waste, as compared to operating power reactors, emergency plansfor ISFSI and MRS need not be equivalent to emergency plans for reactors.Since the proposed revision of Part 72 was published for comment on May27, 1986, the NRC has published proposed amendments to 10 CFR Parts 30,40, and 70\1\<NOTE/> which would require certain NRC fuel cycle and other radioactivematerials licensees that engage in activities that may have the potentialfor a significant accidental release of NRC-licensed materials to establishand maintain approved emergency plans for responding to such accidents.Although applicable to persons licensed under different parts of the Commission'sregulations, the proposed requirements for emergency plans in Parts 30,40, and 70 contain substantially identical provisions because they aredesigned to protect the public against similar radiological hazards. Theproposed revision of Part 72 as published for comment also requires applicantsfor an ISFSI or MRS license to submit an emergency plan (see andSection;72.32 (andSection; 72.19).) Although the texts of proposed andSection; 72.19(redesignated andSection; 72.32) and the parallel provisions of the proposedEmergency Preparedness rule are not identical, these provisions have thesame purpose and use the same approach. In both cases, the proposed regulationsrequire onsite emergency planning with provisions for offsite emergencyresponse in terms of coordination and communication with offsite authoritiesand the public. It is therefore appropriate that in both cases these requirementsshould be expressed in the same way.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Proposed rule on Emergency Preparedness for Fuel Cycleand Other Radioactive Material Licensees, 52 FR 12921, April 20, 1987.Until the Commission promulgates the Emergency Preparedness rule in finalform, it is not possible to ascertain exactly the language that shouldbe used. In view of these circumstances and since there is every expectationthat this period of uncertainty will be of relatively short duration, webelieve the prudent course of action is to reserve andSection; 72.32 (andSection;72.19), Emergency plan, in the final rule with the understanding that thetext of this section will be promulgated in final form as a conformingamendment when the Commission adopts and promulgates the final EmergencyPreparedness rule or shortly thereafter. We should point out that the temporaryabsence from Part 72 of requirements respecting emergency plans does notpresent any difficulties from a regulatory standpoint. To date, only threelicenses have been issued under Part 72. Two licensees also hold Part 50licenses and are required to comply with the provisions respecting emergencyplans set out in the Part. The Part 72 license held by the third licenseecontains conditions relating to emergency planning with which that licenseemust comply.Sabotage, terrorism, and military attacks are not treated as emergencypreparedness issues. The Commission's established practice with respectto dangers of enemy action is that the protection of the United Statesagainst hostile enemy acts is a responsibility of the nation's defenseestablishment and the various agencies having internal security functions.Acts other than military are covered under a planning system included inSubpart H of Part 72, which contains requirements respecting physical securityand safeguards contingency plans that are specifically designed to precludethe occurrence of such acts. The primary purpose of an emergency responseplan is to prescribe measures to be taken to mitigate the effects of accidentalreleases of radioactivity, irrespective of their cause. Thus, in the unlikelyevent that there should be an accidental release of radioactivity by reasonof an act of terrorism or an act of sabotage, protective actions wouldbe taken as prescribed in the emergency response plan, just as they wouldbe taken in the case of accidental release arriving from other causes.6. Department of Energy as Licensee for the MRS <T3>Comment: </T3>Respondents commented on several aspects of the licensingof the Department of Energy for the MRS. One commenter requested that inevery instance in which there would be a difference in requirement betweenthe Department and other licensees, that that difference should be specificallydefined in Part 72. Other commenters pointed out that the funding for theMRS was from the Nuclear Waste Fund as stipulated in the NWPA and, therefore,the Department should be required, through Part 72, to show how these fundswill be adequate for operation and decommissioning. A further commenterquestioned the Department's authority pursuant both to Part 72 and itsown orders to delegate quality assurance responsibilities to its contractor(s).One commenter suggested that Part 72 should permit revocation or suspensionof the Department's license for the MRS since the NRC could not imposecivil penalties for license violations.<T3>Response: </T3>As discussed in the supplementary information to theproposed revisions to Part 72, the Department of Energy is exempted fromcertain financial reports, creditor information and financial plans fordecommissioning. As pointed out in the comment above, funding for the MRSwill be from the Nuclear Waste Fund, separately accountable from publicfunds. Consistent with the principle of full cost recovery in section 302of the NWPA (96 Stat. 2257, 42 U.S.C. 10222) this fund will provide allfinancial resources for the MRS, i.e., licensing, construction, operationand decommissioning. Since DOE is a federal agency and the status of theNWPA waste fund is reported to and reviewed by the Congress yearly, theCommission believes that Congress will assure that adequate funds are availableand appropriated for DOE to carry out its statutory responsibility. Underthese circumstances additional NRC oversight is unnecessary and inappropriate.As to possible conflicts in the licensing and regulatory process betweenorders and procedures of the Department of Energy and NRC requirements,two government agencies, the commenter provided no specifics and the Commissionis not aware of any such conflict. The Department will be provided thesame latitude as any other licensee pursuant to andSection; 72.142 (andSection;72.101) wherein it is stated that ``the licensee may delegate to others,such as contractors, agents, or consultants, the work of establishing andexecuting the quality assurance program, but shall retain responsibilityfor the program.''The Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, and the Nuclear WastePolicy Act of 1982, as amended, provide that upon authorization by Congressan MRS shall be subject to licensing by the Commission. Accordingly, noexemptions from the provisions of andSection; 72.60 (andSection; 72.41), ``Modification,revocation, and suspension of licenses'' and andSection; 72.84 (andSection;72.57), ``Violation'' are shown for the Department. In the exercise ofthis broad statutory authority and consistent with its customary practicein regulating other Federal licensees, the Commission may impose penaltieson the Department if there is sufficient justification. The Commissionknows of no other differences between the Department and other licenseesfor which a change in Part 72 is warranted. (The commenters recommendedno specific changes in this area.)7. Minimum Decay Period (Age) for Receipt of Spent Fuel <T3>Comment: </T3>It was noted that there is a seeming discrepancy betweenthe minimum decay period (age) of spent fuel as specified in andSection;72.2 (one year) and a reference to the environmental analysis in NUREG-1140,``A Regulatory Analysis on Emergency Preparedness for Fuel Cycle and OtherRadioactive Material Licensees'' (five-year decay assumed).<T3>Response: </T3>The minimum one-year decay period in andSection; 72.2is based on assuring the decay of radioisotopes having half-lives on theorder of a few days or less. In actuality, the decay periods are likelyto be much longer than one year. Accordingly, the NUREG-1140 analyses werebased on the more realistic, but still conservative, assumption that fiveor more years of decay would have taken place for the spent fuel for whichan accident in a dry cask was assumed. This is not a discrepancy sincedifferent purposes are being served in each instance. In choosing a nominaldecay period of 10 years and a five-year minimum decay period in the designparameters for the MRS the Department of Energy (DOE) is merely exercisingits own prerogative to use a longer decay criterion for purposes of fuelreceipt. Selection of a five-year minimum decay period also reflects DOE'sunderstanding that the spent fuel to be received at the MRS will alreadyhave decayed for periods of time likely to be even much greater than fiveyears at individual power reactor sites. The original analysis for Part72 was based on one-year decay.8. Physical Security Plan<T3>Comment: </T3>A few commenters were concerned about the proposed changein the requirements of the physical security plan for the Department ofEnergy in that the Department must provide a certification that it willprovide at the MRS ``such safeguards as it requires at comparable surfaceDOE facilities to promote the common defense and security.'' The concernswere that this was an added requirement imposed only on the Departmentand that there was no definition of what a ``comparable'' DOE facilitywould consist of.<T3>Response: </T3>For all licensees physical security plans are designedfor two purposes: (1) To protect against sabotage and (2) to promote thecommon defense and security. The change in the requirements of the physicalsecurity plan is intended to be consistent with 10 CFR Part 60, ``Disposalof High-Level Radioactive Wastes in Geologic Repositories,'' wherein itis recognized that the Department already carries these responsibilitiesfor all of its facilities.The Department in carrying out its responsibility to promote the commondefense and security of all its facilities can best identify the surfaceDOE facilities to which the MRS is most comparable for purposes of physicalsecurity without the unnecessary burden of an NRC definition of ``Comparable.''Comparability in this context is a function of the kinds and quantitiesof nuclear materials held at the facilities and the potential consequencesof theft or sabotage. However, the NRC staff believes that the ReceivingBasin for Off-Site Fuel at the Savannah River Plant may be an appropriatelycomparable facility.9. Continous Cask Monitoring Provision<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters pointed out that the wording of theprovision in andSection; 72.122(h)(4) (andSection; 72.92(h)(4)) for monitoringof storage confinement systems was inconsistent with section 141(b)(1)(B)of the NWPA (96 Stat. 2242, 42 U.S.C. 10161(b)(1)(B)) wherein it is requiredthat an MRS facility shall be designed to permit continous monitoring.Another commenter suggested that the State should participate in the monitoring.<T3>Response: </T3>The difference in wording between section 141(b)(1)(B)of the NWPA (96 Stat. 2242, 42 U.S.C. 10161(b)(1)(B)) and andSection; 72.122(h)(4)(andSection; 72.92(h)(4)) was inadvertent. The staff has corrected the wordingof andSection; 72.122(h)(4) (andSection; 72.92(h)(4)) in the final rule toagree with the NWPA. As to State participation in monitoring, this is amatter to be resolved with the Department or as indicated in Response Number3.10. Inspection and/or Monitoring<T3>Comment: </T3>In andSection; 72.44(c)(3) (andSection; 72.33(c)(3)) thewords ``inspection and monitoring'' have been changed to ``inspection ormonitoring.''<T3>Response: </T3>The proposed change serves no useful purpose. The degreeand method of inspection and monitoring will be dependent upon design andoperational limits for specific cases. The words ``inspection and monitoring''will be reinstated.11. Foreign Fuel<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed objection to the processing andstorage of foreign spent fuel or HLW at the MRS and stated that it shouldbe specifically prohibited.<T3>Response: </T3>The reference to foreign fuel in andSection; 72.78 (andSection;72.54) of the proposed rule was limited to material transfer report requirementsand was not intended either to restrict or to permit such processing orstorage. Section 302(a) of the NWPA (96 Stat. 2257, 42 U.S.C. 10222(a))does specify only ``high-level radioactive waste, or spent nuclear fuelof domestic origin'' and therefore the reference to foreign fuel at anMRS will be removed.12. Tornado Missile<T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters have disagreed with the deletion of the exemptionregarding protection against tornado missile impact, that is, as expressedin the existing rule, ``* * * An ISFSI need not be protected from tornadomissiles * * *''. Another commenter who favors the deletion concerningprotection from tornado missiles would also have the restriction limitingits scope to ``* * * structures, systems, and components important to safety''deleted.<T3>Response: </T3>The explanation of the exemption for tornado missiles,set out in the preamble of the existing rule (45 FR 74693, November 12,1980) states that radionuclide releases from spent fuel which has undergoneat least a year of radioactive decay would not be significant in the eventof tornado missile impact, citing an accident evaluation from NUREG-0575``Generic Environmental Impact Statement on Handling and Storage of SpentLight Water Power Reactor Fuels'' with gaseous radionuclide releases fromwater pool storage. With the continuing development of dry storage technologies,which include metal casks, concrete silos, dry wells, and air-cooled vaults,the Commission decided the designs should take into account tornado missileprotection, unless it is shown that tornado missiles will not have anyeffect on structures, systems and components important to safety. Whileoffsite gaseous release impacts from fuel rod rupture due to a tornadomissile incident would remain insignificant, it is important to assurethat design criteria for dry storage designs continue to address maintainingconfinement of particulate material. All safety reviews for storage licensedunder Part 72, both water pool and dry storage, have evaluated designswith respect to tornado missile impact. Since safety considerations drivethe concern with respect to the tornado missile phenomenon, it is not necessaryto expand that concern beyond ``structures, systems, and components importantto safety.''13. Use of Part 50 Criteria<T3>Comment: </T3>To expedite the licensing process for facilities proposedon sites which currently possess a 10 CFR Part 50 license, it was proposedthat the applicable siting evaluation factors and general design criteriawhich have been reviewed and approved by the NRC for the Part 50 licensebe directly adopted for the Part 72 facility without additional review,hearings or approvals. Adequate reviews and approvals have been completed,and any change to those previously approved should be treated as a backfit.<T3>Response: </T3>The storage of an increased amount of spent fuel ona reactor site, over that covered under an existing Part 50 license, requiresstaff action through safety and environmental reviews. In taking this actionto authorize additional storage capacity for spent fuel, the staff willapply criteria from Part 50 or Part 72, depending on the type of licensingaction being sought. Licensing action for an ISFSI would use criteria containedin Part 72 and Part 50 would be used for amending an existing reactor license.Storage of spent fuel on a reactor site outside of an existing reactorbasin is already regulated under the criteria of Part 72 and these criteriahave been used in reviewing applications for additional fuel storage atreactor sites.14. Cladding<T3>Comment: </T3>Opposition is expressed to any lowering of fuel claddingprotection, as provided for in the existing andSection; 72.122(h)(1) (andSection;72.92(h)(1)).<T3>Response:</T3> The revision of this provision (i.e., andSection; 72.122(h)(1)(andSection; 72.92(h)(1))) addressed confinement of fuel material, whichis the purpose of protecting the fuel cladding. The revised provision specificallyprovides for additional alternative means of accomplishing this objective.This serves to enhance confinement protection capability rather than diminishit.15. Rod Consolidation<T3>Comment:</T3> Comments were received concerning the Department of Energy'splan to consolidate rods from spent fuel assemblies into sealed packages.One commenter suggested inserting the word ``chemically'' after the word``separated'' in the definition of spent nuclear fuel. Another commentsuggested that a separate environmental impact statement be prepared onrod consolidation. It was suggested that the NRC give rod consolidationspecial consideration and that it is not clear at present what requirementsthe NRC will use for rod consolidation.<T3>Response:</T3> Rod consolidation is the most elaborate operation contemplatedfor the MRS. The Department of Energy in its proposal and elsewhere hasindicated its intention to fully develop the rod consolidation processfor installation and operation. The rod consolidation system must meetall applicable portions of the general design criteria. There is no precedentfor the preparation of an environmental impact statement in connectionwith a single system of a facility for which a complete environmental impactstatement will be prepared. The aspect of rod consolidation will be coveredin that statement, as well as in the safety review and evaluation by thestaff in connection with the application for an MRS. The NRC does expectto be kept informed by the Department of its developmental activities priorto receipt of an application.The insertion of the word ``chemically'' as suggested has been acceptedby the staff for the final rule.16. Accident Analysis For Two Barriers<T3>Comment</T3>: A comment was received regarding engineered barrierssuch as canisters, ``* * * the design basis accident scenario (i.e., releaseof gap activity from all fuel contained in a dry cask) should be revisedto account for cases in which canister or other engineered barriers areincorporated.''<T3>Response:</T3> Most cask designs do not incorporate canistering ofspent fuel assemblies. Therefore, for purposes of this rulemaking, choiceof a lesser accident scenario assuming canistering is not appropriate fora bounding analysis. In a safety review involving a specific design, whichincorporates an additional engineered barrier, the design basis accidentscenario should, of course, consider this addition in the review analysis.17. Records<T3>Comment: </T3>Comments were received concerning archiving of records;by whom and how long?<T3>Response:</T3> The proposed rule is consistent with current NRC policyconcerning retention periods for records. The specific details of theirphysical storage is action taken at time of licensing.18. Operator Safety<T3>Comment:</T3> Comments were received concerning design for ALARA.<T3>Response:</T3> The licensee is responsible for meeting the requirementsof 10 CFR Part 20 ``Standards for Protection Against Radiation,'' and allits provisions for maintaining ALARA. In addition andSection; 72.24 (andSection;72.15) Contents of Application: Technical Information requires applicantsfor a license to supply information for maintaining ALARA for occupationalexposure.19. MRS Collocation with Waste Repository <T3>Comment: </T3>Commenter suggested expanding limitation for collocationwith repository to include other facilities.<T3>Response:</T3> The collocation restrictions in andSection; 72.96 (andSection;72.75) are specifically included in order to comply with sections 141(g)and 145(g) of the NWPA (96 Stat. 2243, 42 U.S.C. 10161(g); 101 Stat. 1330-235,42 U.S.C. 10165(g)). (See also section 135(a)(2), 96 Stat. 2232, 42 U.S.C.10155(a)(2).)20. MRS Collocation with Other Nuclear Facilities<T3>Comment:</T3> Commenter was concerned about other nuclear facilitiesthat are not licensed.<T3>Response: </T3>The licensing process considers all activities and facilities,licensed or unlicensed, that could increase the probability or consequencesof safety significant events at licensed facilities.21. Definition of High-Level Radioactive Waste<T3>Comment:</T3> Some commenters noted that the definition of ``high-levelradioactive waste'' used in Part 72 was not the same as the definitionused in 10 CFR Part 60 and expressed the view that the two definitionsshould be consistent.<T3>Response: </T3>Since it was first promulgated in November 1980 forthe purpose of establishing licensing requirements for the storage of spentfuel in an independent spent fuel storage installation, Part 72, unlikePart 60, has always contained a separate definition of spent fuel. In revisingPart 72 to provide for licensing the storage of spent fuel and high-levelradioactive waste in an MRS, the Commission has revised the definitionof spent fuel to conform more closely to the definition set out in section2(23) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended (96 Stat. 2204,42 U.S.C. 10101(23)). The Commission has also amended andSection;72.3 byadding a definition of ``high-level radioactive waste'' which conformsto the language used in section 2(12) of that Act (42 U.S.C. 10101(12)).The definitions of spent fuel and high-level radioactive waste used inPart 72, though not identical to the definition of high-level radioactivewaste used in 10 CFR Part 60 which encompasses ``irradiated reactor fuel,''are not inconsistent with that definition. It should be noted, however,that as explained in the Commission's advance notice of proposed rulemakingrelating to the definition of high-level radioactive waste (52 FR 5992,February 27, 1987), the definition of high-level radioactive waste usedin Part 60 serves a jurisdictional function, specifically identificationof the class of Department of Energy facilities that, under section 202of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5842) are subject tothe licensing and related regulatory authority of the Commission. 22. High Level Liquid Waste <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters were concerned about the storage ofliquid High-Level Waste (HLW). <T3>Response: </T3>The MRS will be designed and licensed for the storageof irradiated fuel and solidified waste from the processing of fuel. TheMRS will not receive liquid HLW and the form of the solid waste storedwill be that which is compatible with the requirements for permanent disposalin a repository. Any liquid wastes generated at the MRS will be handled in accordance withexisting regulations. 23. Quality Assurance_Quality Control <T3>Comment: </T3>Comments were associated with the apparent differencebetween the quality assurance criteria proposed and the previous qualityassurance criteria. <T3>Response: </T3>The proposed rule quality assurance subpart was writtento incorporate the previously referenced 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B qualityassurance criteria specifically into Part 72. There was no intent to changethe criteria. Minor conforming changes have been made in the final rule.24. Criticality<T3>Comment: </T3>A comment was received concerning the removal of therequirement for verifying continued efficacy of solid neutron poisons.<T3>Response: </T3>Several changes have been made to the criticality sectionof the final rule to make it correspond to other Parts of the Commission'sregulations and standard criticality review practices. Verification ofsolid neutron poisons has been retained. Double contingency criteria andrequirements for criticality monitors have been added. It is not the intentof the revision concerning criticality monitors to require monitors inthe open areas where loaded casks are positioned for storage as that systemis static. Monitors are required where the systems are dynamic.25. MRS Storage Capacity<T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters questioned the MRS storage capacity as statedin the proposed rule in andSection;andSection; 72.1 and 72.96 (andSection;andSection;72.1 and 72.75).<T3>Response: </T3>In the proposed rule, MRS storage capacity values arebased on the NWPA, as approved by Congress. (See section 135(a)(1)(A),96 Stat. 2232, 42 U.S.C. 10155(a)(1)(A) and section 114(d), 96 Stat. 2215as amended by 101 Stat. 1330-230, 42 U.S.C. 10134(d) and section 141(g),96 Stat. 2243, 42 U.S.C. 10161(g)). In addition, the Nuclear Waste PolicyAmendments Act of 1987 provides that the MRS authorized by section 142(b)of NWPA (101 Stat. 1330-232, 42 U.S.C. 10162(b)) shall be subject to thestorage capacity limits specified in sections 148(d) (3) and (4) (101 Stat.1330-236, 42 U.S.C. 10168(d) (3) and (4)). These requirements have beenincorporated in new andSection; 72.44(g) which has been added to the finalrule.26. The Term_``Temporary Storage''<T3>Comment: </T3>Comments objected to the removal of the term ``TemporaryStorage'' from andSection; 72.3 Definitions and the removal of the word ``temporary''from andSection; 72.2 Scope.<T3>Response: </T3>In making these changes, the Commission does not intendto change the scope of Part 72 which relates to the licensing of ISFSIand MRS for the purpose of storage only. Part 72 does not nor is it intendedto cover permanent disposal. Accordingly, use of the word ``temporary''in the rule is non-definitive and unnecessary.27. MRS Rule Making<T3>Comment: </T3>Many commenters (approximately 150), through the useof form letters or paraphrasing, did not want the MRS in Tennessee, didnot support any form of rulemaking until Congress had authorized the MRSthrough funding appropriation, and made reference to ``license it twice.''<T3>Response: </T3>The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987 authorizesthe Department of Energy to site, construct and operate one MRS and prescribesprocedures for the selection of an appropriate site. The Act expresslyannuls and revokes the Department's proposal ``to locate a monitored retrievablestorage facility at a site on the Clinch River in the Roane County portionof Oak Ridge, Tennessee, with alternative sites on the Oak Ridge Reservationof the Department of Energy and on the former site of a proposed nuclearpowerplant in Hartsville, Tennessee * * *'' (Section 142(a), 101 Stat.1330-232, 42 U.S.C. 10162(a)). The Commission's regulations are promulgatedto permit the Commission to carry out its mandate of providing for thehealth and safety of the public. Except for the siting limitations in andSection;72.96 (andSection; 72.75) of the final rule, which, among other things, prohibitsan MRS authorized by section 142(b) of NWPA (101 Stat. 1330-232, 42 U.S.C.10162(b)) from being constructed in Nevada, the Commission's regulationsare silent on the location of an MRS. The ``license it twice'' conceptis addressed in Response Number 2.28. Increase of Licensing Period for the MRS<T3>Comment: </T3> Comments questioned the Commission's basis, as describedin the statement of considerations for the proposed changes to Part 72,for providing a longer license term for an MRS (40 years) than for an ISFSI(20 years). Comments also included (1) the term should start with the receiptof spent fuel, and (2) ISFSI should also have a 40-year license term. Furtherexplanation of the basis for the license term was also requested. All ofthe commenters seemed to concentrate on a license for the spent fuel ratherthan a license covering a facility for storage.<T3>Response: </T3>An MRS as described in the NWPA is intended for storage,but nor necessarily for the same fuel since fuel will continually be movedin and out over the life of the facility in concert with operation of arepository. A longer license term is therefore appropriate for an MRS consideringthe purpose and mode of operation of the facility.In contrast to the MRS, the spent fuel stored in an ISFSI at reactor sitesor elsewhere will be collected until the Department of Energy waste disposalsystem is ready for its receipt. The current schedule indicates that thistransfer from reactor sites to an MRS could begin to occur within about10 years. The Commission has in place a license renewal process for ISFSIstorage which provides an opportunity for extension of the 20-year licenseterm, with staff reevaluation of safety and environmental aspects of theoperation. In any event the systematic inspection program of the Commissionwherein the licensee's adherence to all license conditions and technicalspecifications is continually being examined applies to both MRS and ISFSIstorage over the entire period of a license. The Commission will providea 40-year license term for an MRS in the final rule.On December 22, 1987, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987 (SubtitleA of Title V of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act for Fiscal Year 1988;Pub. L. 100-203, 101 Stat. 1330-227) was approved by the President andbecame public law. The 1987 amendments authorized the Secretary of theDepartment of Energy to site, construct and operate one monitored retrievablestorage facility subject to certain statutory conditions (sec. 142(b),101 Stat. 1330-232, 42 U.S.C. 10162(b)). As a result of these changes inthe statute, it has been necessary to make certain conforming changes inthe text of the final rule. Most of the changes are minor in nature. Forexample, references have been added to the authority section and conformingchanges have been made in the following sections of the rule: andSection;andSection;72.22(d)(5), 72.40(b), 72.90(e) and 72.96(d) (andSection;andSection; 72.14(d)(5),72.31(b), 72.70(e) and 72.75(d)). A new paragraph (g) has been added toandSection; 72.44 (andSection; 72.33), License conditions, to incorporate intothe Commission's regulations the specific statutory conditions (<T3>see</T3> sec. 148(d) of the NWPA, 101 Stat. 1330-236, 42 U.S.C. 10168(d))which must be included in a Commission license for the monitored retrievablestorage installation authorized pursuant to section 142(b) of the NWPA(101 Stat. 1330-232, 42 U.S.C. 10162(b)). For an explanation of these conditions,<T3>see </T3>133 Cong. Rec. H11973-75 and S18683-84 (daily ed. December21, 1987).Having considered all of the above, the Commission has determined thata final rule be promulgated. The text of the final rule has some changesas noted from the proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed amendments to 10 CFR Part 72, ``Licensing Requirementsfor the Independent Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel and High-Level RadioactiveWaste.''NUREG-0575, ``Final Generic Environmental Impact Statement on Handlingand Storage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor Fuel,'' August 1979, wasissued in support of the final rule promulgating 10 CFR Part 72. ``LicensingRequirements for the Storage of Spent Fuel in an Independent Spent FuelStorage Installation ISFSI),'' which became effective November 28, 1980.On January 7, 1983, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 was signed intolaw. On December 22, 1987, the Act was amended by the Nuclear Waste PolicyAmendments Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-203, Title V, Subtitle A, 101 Stat.1330-227). Section 142(b) of the amended Act (101 Stat. 1330-232, 42 U.S.C.10162(b)) authorized the Secretary of the Department of Energy to site,construct and operate one MRS. NWPA also established procedures which aState or an Indian tribe may use to negotiate an agreement with the FederalGovernment under which the State or Indian tribe would agree to host anMRS within the State or reservation. Following enactment of legislationto implement the negotiated agreement, the Secretary of the Departmentof Energy could proceed to evaluate appropriate sites. As in the case ofthe MRS authorized by section 142(b) of NWPA (101 Stat. 1330-232, 42 U.S.C.10162(b)), DOE must also obtain an NRC license for an MRS authorized byCongress pursuant to a negotiated agreement. The NRC staff has concludedthat although existing 10 CFR Part 72 is generally applicable to the design,construction, operation, and decommissioning of MRS, additions are necessaryto explicitly cover the licensing of spent nuclear fuel and high-levelradioactive waste storage in an MRS. In August 1984, the NRC publishedan environmental assessment for this proposed revision of Part 72, NUREG-1092,``Environmental Assessment for 10 CFR Part 72, Licensing Requirements forthe Independent Storage of Spent Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste.''NUREG-1092 discusses the major issues of the rule and the potential impacton the environment. The findings of the environmental assessment are ``(1)past experience with water pool storage of spent fuel establishes the technologyfor long-term storage of spent fuel without affecting the health and safetyof the public, (2) the proposed rulemaking to include the criteria of 10CFR Part 72 for storing spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive wastedoes not significantly affect the environment, (3) solid high-level wasteis comparable to spent fuel in its heat generation and in its radioactivematerial content on a per metric ton basis, and (4) knowledge of materialdegradation mechanisms under dry storage conditions and the ability toinstitute repairs in a reasonable manner without endangering the health[and safety] of the public shows dry storage technology options do notsignificantly impact the environment.'' The assessment concludes that,among other things, there are no significant environmental impacts as aresult of promulgation of these revisions of 10 CFR Part 72.Based on the above assessment the Commission concludes that the rulemakingaction will not have a significant incremental environmental impact onthe quality of the human environment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act Statement</ITAG>This final rule amends information collection requirements that are subjectto the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). These requirements were approved by the Office of Managementand Budget approval number 3150-0132.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Analysis</ITAG>The NRC has prepared a regulatory analysis on this final rule. The analysisexamines the benefits and alternatives considered by the NRC. The analysisis available for inspection in the NRC Public Document Room, 1717 H StreetNW., Washington, DC. Single copies of the analysis may be obtained fromC.W. Nilsen, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear RegulatoryCommission, Washington, DC 20555 (301-492-3834).<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Certification</ITAG>In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)),the Commission certifies that this rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. This final rule affectsonly the licensing and operation of independent spent fuel storage installationsand of monitored retrievable storage installations. The owners of theseinstallations, nuclear power plant utilities or DOE, do not fall withinthe scope of the definition of ``small entities'' set forth in section601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act or within the definition of ``smallbusiness'' in section 3 of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 632, or withinthe Small Business Size Standards set out in regulations issued by theSmall Business
