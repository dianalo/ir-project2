Mr. Webster, who is leaving his post as director ofcentral intelligence, noted that both governments have longbeen confident that the Soviet strategic missiles andwarheads aimed at the U.S. are under &quot;ironclad&quot; control andcouldn't be fired accidentally, even if rebellions break out.</LP><TEXT>   But, he told reporters, &quot;what I think we're seeing now issome concern on the part of the {Soviet} central government.&quot;He said the U.S. has learned that the Soviets have started&quot;looking at what they need to do to be sure that the missilesdo not fall into unfriendly hands, that they are moved ifnecessary, that the systems that they have in place toprevent someone from engaging in unauthorized fire are intactand protected.&quot;   He offered no further details, but said the new Sovietconcern &quot;of course lowers the level of our confidence.&quot; Inthe past, the U.S. has brushed off concern about missilesbased in rebellious republics by asserting that Moscowmaintains strong and overlapping controls over the weapons.   Mr. Webster cautioned that security hasn't broken downyet, but he added that &quot;this is one {issue} that we will haveto pay a lot of attention to as the {Soviet} centralgovernment loses its control on the ground.&quot;   The Central Intelligence Agency boss also predicted thatsome Soviet Republics will win independence, possibly thisyear, thus starting the breakup of the U.S.S.R. And hedeclared that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's ownpolitical survival is &quot;increasingly uncertain.&quot;   On another matter, Mr. Webster hinted strongly thatinvestigators probing the 1988 terrorist bombing of Pan AmFlight 103 now believe that the Libyans suspected of placingthe bomb on the plane weren't acting in conjunction with aSyrian-based terrorist band long thought to have mastermindedthe mass killing. Instead, he suggested, each group wasworking on its own separate plan to blow up a plane, and theSyrian-based group failed while the Libyans succeeded.   &quot;There were several of these activities taking place allabout the same time, with different players,&quot; he said. &quot;Therewere lots of players, not necessarily coordinated.&quot; Someefforts were aborted by arrests and other factors, he added.Members of the Syrian-based terror band, the Popular Frontfor the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, werearrested in Germany two months before the blast, but it hadbeen assumed the group was still behind the bombing.   Any official conclusion that the Libyan activities weren'tcoordinated with the Syrian group are likely to revivecharges that the administration is deliberately playing downSyria's role in order to seek better relations with Damascus.But Mr. Webster, a former federal judge, emphatically deniedthat charge.   &quot;That is simply not true,&quot; he said. &quot;Nobody has ever triedto say . . . `Let's change the spin on it.'&quot;   He also said he was cautiously optimistic that the Westernhostages held in Lebanon might soon be released in a massprisoner exchange with Israel, as Iranian and Shiite leadershave hinted. But he cautioned that such hopes have beendashed before.   President Bush has nominated Deputy National SecurityAdviser Robert Gates to succeed Mr. Webster. The exact dateof Mr. Webster's departure from the post isn't known.</TEXT></DOC>
