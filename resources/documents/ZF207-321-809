Kelly, director of plans and programs at the Army's Program ExecutiveOffice for Standard Army Management Information Systems, said the board willevaluate the test results in April 1990 to determine whether to beginfielding the systems.andM;The minicomputer system, known as the Corps/Theater ADP Service Center, PhaseII (CTASC-II), consists of three portable shelters containing various systemcomponents.andM;Maj.andP;  Floyd N. Cox, a deputy product manager for CTASC-II at Fort Belvoir,Va., said the system will compile medical, personnel and logisticsinformation from Army battalions, brigades and divisions.andM;Lt.andP;  Col.andP;  John E. Caldwell, the former CTASC-II product manager, said itwill accommodate up to 64 users simultaneously, although performance may beimpeded with more than 40 users.andP;  A few on-site terminals, mostlymicrocomputers, will be hard-wired to the system.andP;  Most users will dial intothe system from other locations.andM;Caldwell's replacement, Lt.andP;  Col.andP;  Thomas H. Reichler, became the productmanager in September.andM;CTASC-II was built by Army personnel at Tobyhanna Army Depot, Pa., andbrought to Washington &quot;to show people at the Pentagon what we've built,&quot; Coxsaid.andM;Kelly said the MAISRC approved the CTASC-II system design and the plan tobuild eight prototypes for technical tests.andP;  The tests will determine howwell the systems would operate in a battlefield environment and its mobility,she said.andM;Eight additional off-the-shelf systems will be used to develop CTASCsoftware, Kelly said.andM;After technical tests are concluded in August, operational tests will beginand run through December.andM;Kelly said these tests will evaluate &quot;the use of CTASC in an actual operatingenvironment.&quot;andM;If the Army MAISRC approves the technical and operational test results inApril 1990, the service would begin fielding the systems a month later.andO;Kelly said acquisition would continue through 1994, depending on the amountof funding the program receives.andM;Texcom Inc. of Landover, Md., was awarded a $5.2 million contract to developa communications subsystem and provide training for phase I of the program.andO;Capt.andP;  John D. Burke, another CTASC deputy product manager, said Texcom alsomay perform work on other program phases if contract options are exercised inMarch.andM;The system is based on the Unisys 5000/80 CPU and has 72M disk storage.andP;  Thedisk drives were taken out of four commercial racks by Tobyhanna officialsand transferred into two racks.andM;The CPU was repackaged, shock-mounted and altered to work in battlefieldconditions at temperatures of up to 120 degrees.andM;It was designed to be transported via the Air Force's C-130 tactical airliftaircraft, Cox said.andM;Joseph L. Plesh, head engineer of the Tobyhanna team, said CTASC-II will haveabout twice the processing capacity of the first version of CTASC and will bemuch smaller.andP;  The equipment fits into three vans and can be set up in twohours.andM;The system will tie into a local area network as well as the Defense DataNetwork, Cox said.andP;  Other workstations will be installed in two tents calledStandard Integrated Command Post system shelters.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
