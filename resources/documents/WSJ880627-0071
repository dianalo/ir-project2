In the year-ago second quarter, the automobile-rental and retailing concern posted net income of $231,051, or five cents a share, on revenue of $12.3 million.    The company said it upgraded its rental vehicle fleet during the first six months of this year, increasing its costs. During the same period, revenue was lower than expected because of slower tourist business, Pacific International said. The company also said its loss predictions reflect operating losses and reserves in its retail new car and truck sales divisions. </TEXT></DOC>
