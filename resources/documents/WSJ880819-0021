Schmitt (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> MKT </IN><G> JUS </G><TEXT>   When Ford Motor Co. wanted Bette Midler to perform an old hit in a new car ad, the Divine Miss M turned them down cold. So Ford got the next best thing: one of Ms. Midler's backup vocalists who could do a divine imitation.    Ford also ended up with a lawsuit from Ms. Midler, charging that the company had stolen her singing style. Now a federal appeals court has upheld Ms. Midler's right to sue in the case -- and, as a result, such &quot;sound-alike&quot; commercials, long a popular trick of the ad trade, are beginning to be considered less like creative license and more like a license to steal.    Ms. Midler's case hasn't gone to trial, but the decision in June clearing the way for her suit is considered groundbreaking. By ruling that singers can sue to prevent imitations of their voices from being used in ads, the appeals panel gave singers a protection that courts hadn't previously acknowledged.    Artists are raving about the ruling, but it has drawn scathing reviews from the advertising industry, which faces some big changes if the decision withstands further appeal. Industry attorneys say advertisers will have to take rigorous steps to ensure that unknown performers won't be confused with famous ones. And they say the ruling encourages more litigation to determine whether a voice is distinctive or deliberately impersonated.    &quot;Now every time you hire somebody, you have to worry about whether the person singing sounds like somebody else,&quot; says Felix Kent, a New York lawyer for several major ad agencies.    For years, advertisers have gotten away with sound-alike commercials because of a quirk in the federal copyright law: Although the law prohibits the unauthorized copying of songs and musical compositions, actual performances can be freely imitated. Once an advertiser buys the rights to a song, it can duplicate a famous rendition with less-expensive studio musicians and imitative singers.    Advertisers and copyright lawyers have long defended the arrangement, contending that it promotes creativity in the arts by protecting only works that are &quot;fixed,&quot; such as written material, while allowing leeway in actual performances. They say singers who want to prevent their performances from being imitated can simply buy the rights to the songs.    Performers, however, say the system doesn't always work so well in practice. Purchasing songs, for one thing, can be expensive or impractical. Moreover, singers say they shouldn't have to buy the rights to a performing style they've created.    &quot;A lot of entertainers are concerned about the issue,&quot; says New York attorney Leonard Marks, who represents Whitney Houston and Madonna, among other performers. &quot;Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but when it is done in a commercial setting to peddle a product, it is just another aspect of ripping off an artist without paying for it.&quot;    Adds Neil Boorstyn, a copyright lawyer and professor at the University of California's Hastings College of Law: &quot;What the law has not recognized is the right of the performer in his or her distinctive rendition of that particular song. That is what this decision opens the door to.&quot;    In the past, celebrities and performers have found some protection outside the copyright law. Federal law prohibits ads that wrongly suggest a famous person's endorsement, and several states have outlawed ads that use the names or attributes of famous people without permission. Woody Allen and Jacqueline Onassis, for example, have used such laws to stop ads featuring actors who resembled them.    Under such laws, a few famous speaking voices, such as Rodney Dangerfield's, also have been getting a little more respect. John Lavely, a Los Angeles attorney for Mr. Dangerfield, says the comedian recently settled a suit against a Florida car dealership that used ads featuring an impersonation of his voice.    But such protection generally hasn't extended to singers -- until the Midler case.    The Midler sound-alike ad ran in 1986 as part of a splashy pitch for Ford's Mercury Sable. Ford had asked Ms. Midler to sing &quot;Do You Wanna Dance&quot; in the ad, but the actress rejected the proposal, as she has done with all commercial endorsement requests. Undaunted, Ford turned to Ula Hedwig, who apparently had been paying more than a little attention during her 10-year membership in Ms. Midler's backup group, the &quot;Harlettes.&quot;    Many listeners were convinced that the voice in the ad was Ms. Midler's. &quot;I thought it was her. In fact, I was surprised when it was not her,&quot; says a spokesman for Ron Smith's Celebrity Look-Alikes, a Los Angeles agency for look-alike and sound-alike performers.    Ms. Midler sued Ford in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles for misappropriating her version of the song. &quot;Ford is trading off on Bette Midler. That is unjust and unmoral,&quot; says her attorney, Gerald Edelstein. &quot;They took something away from her. She has never endorsed a commercial product, and if she ever did, that would be worth a lot of money.&quot;    The auto maker countered that, under the copyright law, Ms. Midler's suit should be thrown out. Indeed, the same federal appeals court that ended up backing Ms. Midler had thrown out a similar case in 1970 involving Nancy Sinatra and a tire ad using her trademark song, &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin'.&quot;    Ford contends that Ms. Midler deserved even less protection because eight other artists had recorded &quot;Do You Wanna Dance&quot; since Bobby Freeman wrote it in 1958. The district court sided with Ford and its ad agency, Young andamp; Rubicam, and dismissed the case -- despite finding that the defendants had done the work &quot;of an average thief.&quot;    But the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco overturned the decision, ruling that Ms. Midler should have her day in court.    &quot;When a distinctive voice of a professional singer is widely known and is deliberately imitated in order to sell a product, the sellers have appropriated what is not theirs,&quot; the appeals panel said. Ford has asked the court to reconsider its decision; pending any further appeal, the trial is expected to begin later this year.    Whether Ms. Midler wins or loses, the ruling -- if upheld -- clears the way for other suits against sound-alike commercials. Technically, the decision only involves California law, but its impact would still be far-reaching because of the prominence of the music industry in the state.    Mr. Kent, the New York lawyer, says that as a precaution he is urging ad-agency clients to use male singers for songs that female performers have made popular. And Richard Kurnit, a New York advertising lawyer who has defended look-alike performers, says the ruling will result in more litigation because it is vague about what determines whether a voice is distinctive or imitated.    Robert Callagy, attorney for Ford and Young andamp; Rubicam, says the ruling will cut into songwriters' music royalties, since advertisers will be less likely to use some well-known songs. &quot;To the extent that you preclude a use such as this, you as a copyright owner are going to lose a market for licensing rights,&quot; he says.    Impersonators also may end up doing a double take at the lost income. &quot;It would have a huge impact,&quot; says Mark Vieha, a Los Angeles music producer who sings in sound-alike ads and knows other performers who will be affected. &quot;Everybody I know does somebody well,&quot; says Mr. Vieha, who &quot;does&quot; James Taylor, in a coming Revco drugstore spot. &quot;Some of them are absolutely indistinguishable from the original artist.&quot;    Mr. Vieha defends sound-alike commercials because they give lesser-known artists a break. &quot;The stars of this business make enough money,&quot; he says. &quot;Nobody would go broke if the unsung heroes in the background -- studio musicians, songwriters -- got a little more respect.&quot;    Still, he adds, &quot;I have quite frankly wondered how it was we were able to do&quot; the imitations legally.    Some producers of sound-alike ads concede, up to a point, that distinctive voices deserve extra consideration. Singers such as Ms. Midler &quot;are unique vocal instruments,&quot; says Bo Donovan, a San Diego music producer, who plans to see a lawyer before doing too many more sound-alikes. &quot;There are no others like them -- although I guess they found one, didn't they?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
