By clamorous voice vote, the delegates bellowed their approvalafter Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., said: ``This platform is forour children. ... This is a document for the future of America.''   In the entire arena, only a scattered few voices were heard whenHouse Speaker Jim Wright asked if there were any nays.   After rebuffing the Jackson campaign on taxes and nuclearstrategy, delegates to the Democratic National Convention embraceda raft of compromise amendments on other Jackson positions beforeshouting their final approval of the entire platform.   The platform debate followed a script agreed to by MichaelDukakis, the party's presidential nominee-to-be, and Jackson.   That script included a heated debate on a minority plank callingfor self-determination for the Palestinians. The Jackson sidewithdrew the matter without putting it to a vote.   Michigan Gov. James J. Blanchard, chairman of the PlatformCommittee, said the platform will surprise skeptics who ``said itcouldn't be done. They said neither party could say `no' to thespecial interests, the lobbyists, the money brokers.''   The so-called Jackson ``Fair Tax'' plank was defeated 2,499 to1,091.5. There were 90 abstentions.   The minority plank on no first use of nuclear weapons went down,2,474.1 to 1,220.6 with 67 abstentions.   As promised, the Palestinian platform never came to a vote.   ``The deadly silence that submerged the issue of Palestinianrights has been shattered,'' said James Zogby, executive directorof the Arab-American Institute and a Jackson adviser. As he spoke,a huge banner was carried across the crowded convention floorreading: ``Self-Determination and Statehood for the PalestinianPeople.''   But Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii called the Jackson Middle Eastplank ``a vicious kick in the teeth of America's interests in thatpart of the world.''   Jackson's tax plank called for higher taxes for businesses andthe very wealthy.   But Denver Mayor Frederico Pena, said, ``Let's not tie(Dukakis') hands with a tax increase.''   ``I don't like throwing softballs to an opponent to knock out ofthe park and a tax hike pitch is a grand slam for George Bush,''said Pena.   The Dukakis and Jackson campaigns had settled most of theirdifferences beforehand.   As part of the agreement between the two campaigns, the Jacksonforces said they would not press their demand for a five-yearfreeze on Pentagon spending.   The Dukakis campaign made concessions on nine other disputedplatform issues, from spending on education and Head Start to acall for a mutual moratorium on missile flight testing.   The Dukakis campaign also accepted intact a Jackson budget plankthat states: ``Investing in America and reducing the deficitrequires that the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share andthat we restrain Pentagon spending.''   The platform was barely 4,500 words before amendments.   Titled ``The Restoration of Competence and the Revival ofHope,'' it makes no mention of either Ronald Reagan or George Bush,but promises to reverse ``voodoo economics,'' help the homeless andneedy, improve education and maintain ``more stable defensebudgets.''   ``Jackon has had a greater impact on this platform than anycandidate other than a nominee in memory,'' Eleanor Holmes Norton,Jackson's chief platform negotiator, boasted.   Michael Barnes, Dukakis' negotiator, said, ``We don't haveanything in the document that runs counter to Governor Dukakis'positions.'' He denied a Jackson campaign claim that the compromiselanguage on Head Start, pre-natal care and nutrition programs forpregnant women and babies amounted to ``a commitment of roughly $9billion.''   ``We don't have anything in the platform that could be describedas a specific budget item that would in any way commit the nextCongress or commit the next president, even theoretically,'' saidBarnes.   On the Middle East, Zogby said, ``We wanted a debate, but wedidn't want a bloodletting.''   Hyman Bookbinder, a Dukakis adviser who was formerly theAmerican Jewish Committee's Washington representative, said, ``Thepro-Israel community is very pleased with the way its coming out''and that the majority plank is ``not anti-Palestinian.''   The platform calls for ``new leadership to deliver the promiseof peace and security through negotiations that has been held outto Israel and its neighbors by the Camp David Accords.'' It makesno specific mention of the Palestinians.   Jackson lost a 1984 platform dispute in San Francisco over theno-first-use of nuclear weapons issue.   Current U.S. and NATO policy would allow first use in the eventof a Soviet invasion of Europe.   Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, told a forum at the Carter Center on Tuesday thatJackson's plank, if passed, would ``shake the (NATO) alliance toits core.''   ``What that says to the Europeans is that as long as the Sovietscan contain it to a tank war, even chemical weapons, they can comein and take Western Europe,'' said Nunn.   The platform negotiators resumed talks Monday after a six-dayhiatus caused by tension between Jackson and Dukakis. Norton saidthe Middle East plank was the last on the table.   This shaped up as the tersest Democratic platform since FranklinD. Roosevelt ran on platforms of only a few thousand words in 1932and 1936. The Democrats' 1984 blueprint was eight times longer.</TEXT></DOC>
