 Desktop publishing programs and traditional composition productscompeted for customers, often side by side or across the aisles.andP;  Walkingaround the show floor and listening to the speakers in the conferencesessions, we were struck by how much has changed since the first DesktopPublishing Conference four years ago.andM;The CPC is a big show--too big to treat in a single issue of the SeyboldReport.andP;  We are therefore focusing this article on the vendors that serve thehigh-end markets and the products aimed at professional publishers.andP;  The restof the story will appear in the November and December issues of the SeyboldReport on Desktop Publishing.andP;  But before we get into the coverage ofindividual systems, we'd like to provide a quick summary of the conferencesessions.andM;Driven from the desktopandM;Over the past five years, the publishing industry has witnessed tremendouschanges.andP;  Many of the changes are due to the developments in desktoppublishing, which in turn rest on the improvements in desktop computers.andP;  Atthe Seybold Seminars in March '89, Cal Bauer told a skeptical audience that,whether they liked it or not, the publishing industry was being &quot;driven fromthe desktop.&quot;andP;  The technological foundations of the industry were in thehands of the computer people; publishing was merely one application amongmany.andM;However, it has also become clear that publishing is the principalapplication pushing the development of the computer industry.andP;  All of theissues that are now occupying the attention of the computer industry--graphicoperating environments, typography, fonts, page description languages,networking and group productivity, color and images--have long been vital topublishers.andM;Open systems.andP;  The computer industry, like the publishing industry, has hadto grapple with the transition from proprietary systems to openarchitectures.andP;  It is hard for any vendor to give up the advantages of aclosed environment.andP;  Even Microsoft has not been able to break free of thehabit of thinking of MS-DOS as the center of the universe.andP;  How else can weexplain its reaffirmation that it will develop Windows-specific extensions toits version of PostScript, TrueImage, and its assertion that it does not seeany need to make TrueImage compatible with Adobe's PostScript Level 2?andM;At one point, we took a straw poll of how many in the conference audience hada homogeneous environment--all Macs, all PCs, all Suns, etc.).andP;  Only a fewhands went up.andP;  When we asked how many had a mixed environment, nearlyeverybody responded in the affirmative.andP;  We think this is the reality of the1990s.andP;  Users want to be able to take advantage of new technology as itevolves, regardless of who develops it.andP;  As Steve Jobs pointed out, even inthe 1970s the publishing industry had computer systems that were optimizedfor group productivity.andP;  These were all based on proprietary hardware andsoftware.andP;  In the '80s, publishers began to migrate to open architectures inorder to take advantage of the powerful, low-cost personal computers thatwere appearing in the market.andP;  But there was a hidden cost.andP;  The new machineswere exactly that: personal.andP;  They had no facilities for synchronizing thediverse efforts of teams of specialists.andM;This will be the challenge of the '90s: to construct systems that have thegroup productivity features we enjoyed in the '70s, but this time based onheterogeneous hardware and software components.andP;  It will require fastnetworking hardware, multivendor data transfer protocols and applicationprograms written to exchange documents with distant counterparts whose naturecannot be presumed or discovered.andM;Standards for digital interchange.andP;  Jobs underscored his point by showing hisnew suite of color multimedia machines (which are impressive) and proposingthat these were the first examples of a new paradigm of &quot;interpersonalcomputing.&quot;andP;  With the electronic mail and interprocess communication toolsbuilt into every Next machine, users can send messages with voice, formatteddocuments, motion video--anything that can be generated in the Nextenvironment--to other Next machines on the network.andM;Next is blazing a trail for the desktop computing industry.andP;  But the troubleis that, as with all &quot;total computing environments,&quot; the fullest benefits ofa Next computer only extend to other users with a Next machine.andP;  The problemapplies also to Xerox (Viewpoint), IBM (SAA), Apple (Macintosh) and Microsoft(Windows).andM;DEC has taken a larger, enterprise-wide view with its Network ApplicationServices and Compound Document Architecture, which attempt to provide datainterchange among heterogeneous computing elements.andP;  DEC is even extendingthe live links and other CDA goodies to PC applications, as well as the DECworkstation applications you would expect it to support.andP;  DEC has said thatit will support the standards that exist, and help establish those thatdon't, to ensure interchangeability of information.andM;But DEC is just one vendor.andP;  Unless and until the rest of the industry adoptsCDA or some similar architecture, we will have islands of interoperabilitywithin a sea of incompatibility.andP;  Other proposed standards for datainterchange include editable PostScript, the Publication Interchange Language(sponsored by Atex, Quark and IBM), SGML, CALS and Hytime.andP;  Each has adistinct area of usefulness; none can handle the entire job.andP;  This will be anarea of contention and evolution for some time.andM;Another area in which standards will play a key role is in interprocesscommunication, both within a homogeneous computing environment (MacintoshSystem 7, Windows 3.0) and across heterogeneous platforms.andP;  The OS/2named-pipes interface is endorsed by Microsoft, Novell, Banyan, HP, DEC, IBMand others.andP;  Microsoft and Lotus recently announced their Compound DocumentProtocol Specification.andM;the ideal scenario is to be able to edit any given data type (presumably byinvoking the tool that created it) in a compound document, no matter whereyou are on the network or what kind of machine you are running.andM;Adobe emerges a winnerandM;A year ago, Apple and Microsoft, through their agreement on TrueImage andTrueType, threw out a challenge to Adobe's dominance of the PostScript world.andO;The agreement created consternation throughout the publishing industry.andP;  Onthe one hand, Adobe had set a single standard for a page description languageand a font format.andP;  On the other, Adobe's penchant for exploiting itsmonopoly--its stiff licensing fees, refusal to open the Type 1 font format,arrogance in dealing with would-be licensees--wasn't really healthy for theindustry.andM;The existence of real competition had a salutary effect on Adobe, bringingabout many of the changes that everyone wanted to see: aggressive pricing,opening of the Type 1 format, high-speed controllers and improved marketresponsiveness.andP;  Adobe has come out looking like a winner.andM;Editable PostScript.andP;  John Warnock described the possible application of theeditable PostScript file format used in Illustrator 3.0 as a publicationinterchange standard.andP;  Wary from previous exposure to Adobe-defined &quot;industrystandards,&quot; conference attendees did not rush to embrace the proposal.andP;  ThePublishing Interchange Language (PIL) Committee is proposing an alternativestandard for exchanging page geometries between newspaper paginationprograms.andP;  The &quot;battle&quot; between these two efforts may be overblown.andP;  It isentirely possible that the PIL will support editable PostScript as a contentformat, just as it will have to support PostScript output.andP;  We discussed oneapplication of editable PostScript in our last issue; we will discuss PIL ina forthcoming one.andM;TrueImage and TrueType.andP;  In spite of Apple's recent rapprochement with Adobe,Apple made it clear that it still supports TrueType and TrueImage.andP;  Microsoftalso reiterated its support, and said that both will be shipped with Windows3.1 in the first half of next year.andP;  But TrueType is now in a position whereit must prove its superiority--either aesthetically or technically--to betaken seriously by the graphic arts industry.andP;  The users in the audience madeit clear that, to them, Type 1 is the font standard; at best, TrueType willhave to coexist with Type 1 to be successful.andM;Acknowledging this fact, both Apple and Microsoft promised that System 7 andWindows 3.1 will support Adobe Type Manager and that future TrueImageprinters will support both font standards.andM;The long road to desktop colorandM;Color is the last part of the industry to make the transition from closed toopen systems.andP;  In part, that is because color reproduction has been more ofan art than a science.andP;  It still is, despite the advances that have been madein desktop hardware and software.andP;  There were, however, a number of majordevelopments at the Conference.andM;A key turning point came when Kodak announced that it would supportnormalized RGB as the standard color space at the system level.andP;  A year ago,there was deep disagreement among vendors over whether a standard color spacewas even necessary; the high-end system vendors said it wasn't and thelow-end desktop vendors said it was.andP;  Last spring it became clear to everyonethat we had to have it--desktop color had advanced so far that the high-endvendors risked disenfranchisement if they didn't play ball.andP;  At that time, itappeared that CIELAB was the favorite.andP;  Now, it seems that there will be twostandards: normalized RGB for system-level interchange and CIELAB for userinterfaces.andM;On the other hand, both data compression and halftone screening have turnedout to be more complex than had been expected.andP;  It is clear, however, thatcompression is vital to open-architecture systems; without it, the sheervolume of data in high-resolution scanned images would bring the network toits knees.andP;  Compression and screening are currently very active areas ofexperimentation and research; we don't think the last word on either topichas been said yet.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
