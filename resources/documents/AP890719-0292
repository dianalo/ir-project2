Richard Bryan, D-Nev., said.   Bryan told the Senate Commerce communications subcommittee hefeared such tactics would become the ``wave of the future'' andwould go unchecked while Congress bickers over a comprehensivesolution to the problem of soaring campaign spending.   Several senators, including Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest F.Hollings, D-S.C., agreed that a comprehensive campaign spendingreform bill was needed, but that it had become mired down inpartisan battles over proposed spending limits. They said apiecemeal approach may be the only solution.   Wednesday's hearing was on two campaign ad bills. One introducedby Bryan and Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., would require sponsors ofcampaign ads to identify themselves more clearly on screen. A billby Hollings and Sens. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, and John Danforth,R-Mo., would require broadcasters to provide free air time to anyonetargeted by a negative ad from the ``independent'' groups. The billalso would require candidates to personally appear in any ad thatmentions his or her opponent.   Hollings said his intent was not to limit the content ofpolitical ads but to give voters ``clear and direct'' discussion ofissues in which ``the person who makes the claim is heldresponsible.'' He said that cannot happen when candidates themselvesdon't appear in ads.   He said it was a misnomer to call PACs independent, that theyoften are connected with a candidate or political party and thatthey spent $10 million on broadcast ads in 1986.   ``These independent parties are responsible to no one, especiallythe voter,'' Hollings said. ``Yet their enormous expenditures canthrow a campaign way off balance.''   Except on one occasion when Hollings attacked Sen. MitchMcConnell, R-Ky., for ads depicting ``bloodhounds'' searching for anabsentee opponent, the senators generally steered clear of thetouchy subject of negative ads carried out by a candidate's campaign.   One witness, however, political analyst Curtis Gans, showedmemorable attack ads, including Lyndon Johnson's ads hitting BarryGoldwater on nuclear weapons issues in 1964, Sen. Quentin Burdick,D-N.D., being ``bought'' by Eastern labor unions and an ad againstSen. James Sasser of Tennessee that showed a Fidel Castro-likefigure lighting a cigar with a stack of American foreign aid dollars.   Gans said negative ads weren't new, just more prolific. He saidspending on the five most expensive Senate races increased 10-foldfrom 1974 to 1984, with television ad costs mushrooming 30-fold.   Since the 1960s, he added, voter turnout in presidential andmidterm congressional elections has declined more than 20 percent.   He said the decline in voting and the rise in campaign spendingwas ``not coincidental.''</TEXT></DOC>
