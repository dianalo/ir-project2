The timetable was accelerated by enactment earlier this month of an interstate banking bill in Wyoming.    Analysts said the development could hasten the pace of bank acquisitions in New Jersey, which New York banks consider one of the nation's most desirable banking markets.    &quot;This makes it likely that consummation of deals will take place sooner rather than later,&quot; said James J. McDermott Jr., chief of research at Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc., a New York-based securities firm specializing in bank stocks. &quot;It could push interested parties to act more quickly.&quot;    Wyoming Gov. Michael Sullivan signed a bill March 6 allowing banking concerns outside the state to acquire Wyoming banks under certain restrictions.    The effective date of New Jersey's reciprocal banking law is triggered by the latest effective date of reciprocal laws in 13 other states. But the passage of the Wyoming legislation, which is effective May 22, reshuffled the previous order of effective dates for the laws in those states. That, in turn, shifted the effective date of New Jersey's law to Jan. 1, 1988, from July 1, 1988.    In a related matter, Chemical New York Corp. said the apparent change in effective dates in New Jersey wouldn't affect the timing of its plans, announced last May, to acquire Morristown, N.J.-based Horizon Bancorp.    The transaction, which calls for Horizon shareholders to receive cash amounting to 2.5 times the book value of Horizon's common, is scheduled to occur one year after the effective date of full interstate banking in New Jersey, or Jan. 1, 1989, whichever is earlier. A Chemical spokesman said, &quot;There are no plans to accelerate the transaction from the currently scheduled date.&quot;    Several major New York banks also have expressed interest in expanding to New Jersey, including Chase Manhattan Corp., Bank of New York Co. and Citicorp.    &quot;We continue to be interested in New Jersey, because we see it as an integral part of our logical market for retail and commercial banking. We continue to be on the lookout for attractive opportunities,&quot; said a spokesman for Bank of New York.    Barbara Goldsmith, New Jersey's deputy attorney general for banking, said state officials haven't completed a review of the other states' banking laws to determine if they meet New Jersey's requirements.    But Richard E. Harden, secretary of the New Jersey Bankers Association, said that while he hadn't yet reviewed the Wyoming law, it appears to shift the effective date of the New Jersey law to Jan. 1. </TEXT></DOC>
