Christian lawmakers also agreed to a new power-sharingarrangement with rival Moslems, the sources said, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   The breakthroughs were disclosed one day before the finalscheduled session of the fractured Lebanese parliament in Taif,where Moslem and Christian lawmakers have been meeting in an effortto settle their 14-year-old civil war.   The lawmakers would next meet in Lebanon to formerly implementany plan reached on Sunday.   Whatever peace accord, if any, is drafted by Lebanese lawmakersstill must win the approval of the militia leaders who control theguns and the troops involved in Lebanon's civil war.   Syria, with 40,000 troops in Lebanon, has been backing Moslemforces in the war with the Christians and is the main power brokerin the divided country.   Sources at the peace conference, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said Christian lawmakers have been consulting with Gen.Michel Aoun, the commander of Christian forces, and other hard-lineleaders in Beirut.   Aoun's insistence on a quick, guaranteed timetable for thepullout of Syrian troops has stalled the talks.   The conference sources have said Syria accepted the idea thatits troops pull out of a ``security zone'' around the Lebaneseparliament before it meets in formal sessions to approve politicalchanges and elect a new president.   The Syrians would be replaced by Lebanese police backed byAlgerian and Moroccan observers, the sources said.   The sources, however, said Syria refused a specific timetablefor withdrawing from the rest of the country, proposing insteadthat it be worked out by a joint Syria-Lebanon committee.   The sources said the Christians, meanwhile, agreed to politicalchanges that are to give Moslems a greater share of politicalpower. Lebanon's existing political was written when Christianswere thought to be in the majority, but it is believed now thatMoslems comprise a greater share of the population.   Christians have agreed to expand the size of Parliament from 99seats to 128, with an equal number for Moslems and Christians.   The current Parliament, with only 73 surviving members from thelast elections in 1972, was formed under the 6-to-5 advantage forChristians, a formula imposed when Lebanon obtained independencefrom France in 1943.   Syria agreed to provisions in the plan after Saudi ForeignMinister Saud al-Faisal met with Syrian leaders earlier this week.The conference sources said Christian lawmakers seemed ``80 percentsatisfied'' with the Syrian response.   The 63 Christian and Moslem deputies have been in the mountainresort of Taif since Sept. 30.   The sources quoted Faisal as telling the Christian deputies thatwhat he got from Damascus was the ``maximum.''   Christian deputies refused to comment to reporters, saying theyhad first to ``properly study'' what was relayed from Damascus.   Moslem deputies on the other hand appeared to have no hesitationin accepting what was agreed upon in Damascus, with Jamil Kubi, arespected Moslem deputy, saying ``each party got a prize andLebanon got the best prize.''</TEXT></DOC>
