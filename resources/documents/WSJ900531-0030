Most don't need the weapons, Interior Minister Joxesuggested during talks about proposed legislation affecting10,000 municipal policemen. He supported his argument withthe example of London, where only 2,552 of the 26,800 policeofficers are armed.   Roger Chaix, former director of the national intelligenceservice, rejected Mr. Joxe's comparison with London, sayingthat &quot;crime doesn't have the same characteristics in Britainas in France, where unfortunately there is extremely violentcrime.&quot; According to Mr. Chaix, &quot;the London bobby isrespected,&quot; unlike the &quot;police of Paris, Lyon or Marseille.&quot;   Police unions estimate that 95% of France's 80,000 armeduniformed officers would oppose mothballing their guns.                                                                                                          EC AID FOR YUGOSLAVIA                                                                                                          Abel Matutes, the European Community's commissioner forMediterranean countries, said the 12-nation trading blocwould be increasing loan aid to Yugoslavia and would upgradethe current cooperation agreement between Belgrade and the ECinto an association agreement. Mr. Matutes said the nextfive-year loan for Yugoslavia, from July 1, 1991, would be900 million European currency units ($1.1 billion), almostdouble the current five-year loan of 550 million ECUs.                                                                                                          JAPAN'S FEARFUL ILLEGAL WORKERS   Thousands of illegal foreign workers in Japan have beenstreaming to immigration offices to be deported after falserumors they would be arrested under a new law that goes intoeffect tomorrow. Most of the illegal workers are Pakistanis,Malaysians and Bangladeshis. Under the new law, employers orbrokers of illegal aliens -- not the employees themselves --face up to three years in jail.                                                                                                          BANNING BRITISH BEEF                                                                                                          France banned all imports of British beef to protectagainst an outbreak of &quot;mad cow&quot; disease that has killedthousands of British cattle. Agriculture Minister HenriNallet said the ban would be lifted as soon as Paris wasconvinced that the British virus posed no danger to Frenchcitizens. Austria imposed a similar ban Tuesday. The Britishgovernment says there is no evidence that the virus canaffect humans.                                                                                                          GERMAN INFLATION: A PROMISE                                                                                                          West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann saidinflation will be kept under a ceiling of 3% after the twoGermanys form an economic and monetary union. Addressing ameeting of the Anglo-American Press Association in Paris, Mr.Haussmann said the Deutsche Bundesbank will act to keepinflation from exceeding that 3% ceiling. &quot;It is clearlydefined in the state treaty {on economic and monetary union}that money supply for the two German states will be decidedonly by the Deutsche Bundesbank,&quot; he stressed. He said WestGermany's current inflation rate is 2.7%.                                                                                                          EUROPEAN DRUG CONTROLS                                                                                                          The European Community's executive commission said itplanned to introduce stringent controls on trade in chemicalsused to turn plants into addictive narcotics. The 12chemicals, mostly solvents and acids, are used to turn cocaleaves, poppies and other plants into drugs like heroin orcocaine and are used to make synthetic drugs such as LSD. Butthe chemicals are also widely used to make paint, varnish andglue, and the commission said its proposal tried to&quot;reconcile the need to efficiently monitor trade in thesechemicals with the legitimate interests of legal trade.&quot;                                                                                                          SPANISH NUCLEAR SHUTDOWN                                                                                                          The Vandellos I nuclear-power plant in northeastern Spainwas closed permanently yesterday, throwing into doubt thefuture of Spain's nuclear-energy program.   Energy Minister Claudio Aranzadi told parliament thatrepair and modernization of the plant is too great aneconomic burden to &quot;justify to the consumer.&quot; He said thecost of restarting the power station, which was shut downlast October after a fire, would run upwards of 33 billionpesetas ($315 million).   While Spain's Nuclear Safety Commission determined that noradiation leaked from the plant during the fire, the accidentsparked a storm of protest. Questions about the plant'ssafety prompted the government to shut down the powerstation, though few had expected the closure would bepermanent.   &quot;Permanently closing Vandellos clearly sends a signal thatthe anti-nuclear position is gaining ground in thegovernment,&quot; said Jose Porta, an analyst with BSN S.A. inMadrid. He noted that the decision implies thatValdecaballeros nuclear-power plant in central Spain, whichis now 70% complete, isn't likely ever to see a startup.

Japanese wine lovers, usually among the first in the worldeach November to sample France's Beaujolais Nouveau, will beamong the last this year. The charter flights that carry thewine to Japan will be delayed by foreign dignitaries arrivingin Tokyo for Emperor Akihito's enthronement. . . . In SouthAfrica, hijackers seized a truck delivering the latest&quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; tapes from Johannesburg's JanSmuts airport to a local television station. The station saidit would screen repeats until replacements are rushed fromNew York.</TEXT></DOC>
