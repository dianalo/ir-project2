(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For nearly 20 years, Alan Heslop hasbeen one of the Republican Party's top experts on redistricting,drawing the maps and crunching the numbers to help the GOP win U.S.House seats.   But Heslop has also used his skills to help Hispanics in localreapportionment battles in Los Angeles, Phoenix and other states,sometimes benefitting Democratic politicians.   Now the GOP activist is reportedly at the top of President Bush'slist of nominees to head the U.S. Census Bureau, evoking strongreactions from some Democrats worried he might tinker with the 1990Census.   ``A political hit man'' is what California Assembly SpeakerWillie Brown called Heslop, adding he ``has always been a verypolitical operator.''   Brown told reporters the appointment of Heslop to head the CensusBureau would ``guarantee an under-count of blacks and Hispanics,''which Brown said ``would be an absolute disaster for Democrats.''   Heslop was chief reapportionment consultant to CaliforniaRepublicans following the 1970 census. He has maintainedprofessional and social contact with GOP leaders since he leftSacramento in 1973 to establish the Rose Institute at ClaremontMcKenna College near Los Angeles.   Heslop, a 51-year-old Oxford-educated British immigrant, is sopublicity-shy that a reader has to search the fine print to evenfind his name in the 34-page annual report of the Rose Institute.   Heslop refused all public comment since his name surfaced for theCensus post _ except for a response to Brown.   ``No one is more concerned than I am with ensuring an accuratecensus count,'' Heslop said, adding that ``to engage in some sort ofrebuttal of statements made by Willie Brown about a position thathas not yet been offered to me is nonsense.''   Brown's judgment of Heslop is not universal.   ``Brown was intemperate, unfair and just plain wrong ... insteadof trying to undercount minorities, Heslop has sought ways ofincreasing their representation on lawmaking bodies,'' saidpolitical editor Martin Smith of McClatchy Newspapers.   Many California Democrats have declined comment on Brown'scharges, with few willing to disagree with the powerful Assemblyspeaker on the record.   ``Heslop's not Attila the Hun, and he's certainly not a racist,''one California Democrat said on the condition his name not be used.   Tony Quinn, a former GOP reapportionment consultant who is headof research for the California Department of Commerce, said Heslopis ``eminently qualified'' for the Census post.   ``He has spent a lot of time on demographic issues. Heslop knowsthe West and Southwest in particular, and he has worked closely withminorities,'' Quinn said.   Some Democrats have read Machiavellian motives into Heslop'sassistance to minority political activists. They contend thatdesigning districts to put more minority politicians in officeundercuts Democratic attempts to spread the heavy Democraticmajorities of minority neighborhoods over more districts.   That view is disputed by Richard Santillan, a Hispanic activistwho chairs the Department of Ethnic Studies at CaliforniaPolytechnic University in Pomona.   ``That's an invalid argument. Greater minority representation isgoing to help, not hurt the Democratic Party. What it may beundermining is the entrenched white leadership of the DemocraticParty, but it's not undermining the party,'' Santillan said.   Santillan added he ``always had suspicions that the RoseInstitute was a Republican front'' _ before he met Heslop.   ``In 10 years working with him, Alan Heslop has never overtly orsubtly tried to slant our research or inhibit it,'' Santillan said.``There are people who produce statistics to help one party or theother, but Alan Heslop has never done that.''   ``Politically, I'm exactly opposite of Alan Heslop...If hebecomes the census director, he will look to the Latino community,to the black community and to the Asian community for input, and itwill be meaningful input,'' Santillan said.   The Rose Institute of State and Local Government is part ofClaremont McKenna College, a private college with 840 students thatis one of six related colleges sharing a single suburban campusabout 30 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.   Heslop serves as head of the political science department anddirector of the Rose Institute, which is located in a formerpsychology lab on the campus. It receives no subsidy from thecollege and operates as a non-profit, self-supporting think tank.   The institute has spent more than $1.5 million over the pastdozen years to build the California Data Base, which hascomputerized 126 categories of political, economic and otherdemographic data on California's 5,000 census tracts and 26,000voting precincts.   ``No one else, at least this side of the Mississippi, has managedto combine political demographic data with advanced techniques ofcomputer analysis to the extent that we have,'' Heslop said in a1984 interview.   The institute has received grants from businesses and foundationsand has had contracts with political, governmental and businessgroups to conduct studies, use its database or host seminars.   The institute's 1988 annual report lists among its paying clientsboth the George Bush and Michael Dukakis presidential campaigns, thestate of California, the University of California, Los AngelesCounty and businesses ranging from ATandamp;T to Hughes Aircraft.   The most controversial incident in the institute's history was a$700,000 project, financed by a group of corporate executives knownas the California Roundtable, to develop a ``model reapportionmentplan'' for legislative and congressional districts following the1980 census.   Heslop insisted that the plan was intended to be a nonpartisanyardstick for use in evaluating the plans produced by theLegislature. Democrats denounced it as a sham to promote GOP andconservative efforts.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon PMs, June 12</NOTE></DOC>
