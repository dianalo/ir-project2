Russia and Ukraine signed a military andeconomic treaty effectively expelling themselves from theSoviet Union. They invited the other republics &quot;of the formerU.S.S.R.&quot; to join their loose alliance. Meanwhile, theSupreme Soviet voted to suspend Communist Party activity,which means the party is constitutionally protected in theU.S. but a criminal enterprise in the Soviet Union. There isthe risk that suppressing the discredited party could give itthe allure of the forbidden, but with luck these could be thepurges that will end all purges.   One reason the reformers are moving so quickly is the riskthat the old regime could rise from the trash heap ofhistory. While we don't believe in original sin forcommunists, it is sobering that when Mr. Gorbachev chose anew foreign minister for the Soviet Union this week, he foundBoris Pankin. Not much is known about Mr. Pankin except thatas Soviet ambassador to Czechoslovakia he had the savvy toannounce his opposition during last week's coup.</LP><TEXT>   Until Mr. Pankin became an ambassador in the early 1980s,he was in a different line of work. His public title wasdirector of the Soviet copyright office. Western intelligenceexperts say he was also director of the KGB's disinformationdepartment.   Soviet Foreign Minister Pankin's earlier life came tolight in Greece when journalist Paul Anastasi wrote a bookalleging that Mr. Pankin and his deputy, Vassili Sitnikov,secretly arranged to use proceeds from the sale of the GreatSoviet Encyclopedia to help fund the notorious Ethnos. By theearly 1980s, Ethnos had become the largest and mostpro-Kremlin newspaper in Athens. The details of the allegedfunding remain unclear despite several lawsuits, but Mr.Anastasi said the plan was for Ethnos to be just the firstWestern publication Soviet disinformers would help set up.   Ethnos reported that the U.S. and not the Soviet Unionused yellow-rain chemical poisoning, that Solidarity inPoland worked for the CIA, that the Soviets were only tryingto liberate Afghanistan and that East Germany &quot;constitutes amiracle and example for East and West.&quot; Spotting linksbetween Soviet propagandists and infiltrated Europeanpublications became a cottage industry by the mid-1980s.   If these concerns about Mr. Pankin are valid, at the veryleast he might not turn out to be very supportive of flushingthe overseas KGB networks out of hiding. Indeed, despite Mr.Pankin's recent comments about reforming the KGB, we wonderif the disinformation department has been closed down evennow. At the very least, the questions raised by Mr. Anastasiand others who have followed Mr. Pankin's career deserve ananswer before he and Secretary of State Baker sit down todiscuss matters of alleged common interest.   These questions about Mr. Pankin raise a more fundamentalissue: What now is the purpose of a foreign minister for theSoviet Union? Russia has its own able foreign minister. Theother republics have theirs. Yesterday's Russo-Ukraine Treatypledged to respect Soviet treaties with foreign countries.The republics presented their treaty to Mr. Gorbachev, theSupreme Soviet and Mr. Pankin as a &quot;fait accompli&quot;. All ofwhich suggests the Russians have decided there isn't much ofa role left for anyone whose job title is Soviet ForeignMinister.</TEXT></DOC>
