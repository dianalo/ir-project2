The bleached film portions then provide      reflective beam confining interfaces which define the unbleached channels      and form waveguides within the film. The invention also provides for      interfering two laser beams, of like .lambda., at a coupling spot on the      film, which beams are again tuned within the absorption band of such film,      which bleach alternate lines or bars of such film to provide a phase      grating therein. A waveguide can be inscribed in such film to optically      communicate with such phase grating and other components can be added such      as optical interconnects, to direct light on various paths into and out of      such integrated optical film circuit. The thus-formed circuit is preserved      by encapsulating the so-bleached film in a layer of, e.g. epoxy, at a      lower index of refraction than the unbleached film, while the glass      substrate protects the reverse face of such film, which glass also has a      lower index of refraction than the unbleached film so that the optical      components of the invention, e.g. the waveguides, are enclosed on all      sides by reflective interfaces of lower index of refraction to confine and      channel transmitted light therein. The light can enter and exit the      integrated optical circuit of the invention at a phase grating or where      the waveguides reach the film edges. The invention takes advantage of      photobleaching to change the index of refraction of portions of a thin      film to define optical components therein and has located a class of      films, the soluble polydiacetylenes, which, upon photobleaching, provide a      considerable reduction in refractive index, enabling the definition of      optical components in such film. The invention includes the methods of      fabricating such integrated optics as well as the integrated optic      products so-made. </PAL></ABST><GOVT> <PAC>  STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST </PAC><PAR>  The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the      Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty      thereon </PAR></GOVT><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  1. Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  This invention relates to fabricating integrated optics, including optics      in polymer films, particularly polydiacetylene films. </PAR><PAR>  2. Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  Integrated optical circuits include optic components in a film, e.g,      waveguides, optical interconnects, phase gratings and the like, which      direct (or reflect) light beams in a desired direction. These components      have been made in the past by a) ion exchange, a multi-step process      wherein ions are exchanged in a glass substrate or b) ion milling, another      multi-step process which requires a vacuum and an ion gun, both processes      being relatively complex and cumbersome. </PAR><PAR>  In the photobleaching prior art, U.S. Pat. No. 4,677,049 to Gritting      (1987), teaches interposing a photobleachable layer between a mask and a      photo-resist layer and irradiating the layers through the mask. The      exposed parts of the photobleachable layer bleach to form an in situ mask      on the photo-resist layer and enhances the contrast of the mask image on      such photo resist layer. Such enhanced mask images on the photo resist      layer are used for photolithography in the manufacture of integrated      electric circuits. Also see German Patent DE 3346716 Al to Wegner et al.      which appears to disclose the bleaching of polydiacetlylenes into      photo-resist layers to make masks therein. </PAR><PAR>  Also U.S. Pat. No. 4,808,285 to Chen et al. (1989) discloses the making of      Y-couplers and gratings in polydiacetylene film by exposing same to a      scanning electron beam or e-beam, which changes the index of refraction in      such film to a certain depth. This is a cumbersome process which takes      time and in which variation in the scanning rate and/or beam intensity can      vary the depth of penetration into such film. Further the scanning beam      can define ragged diagonal edges in the Y-coupler 100 of FIG. 2, resulting      in beam leakage thereat. Additional beam leakage can occur in the      unirradiated core 310 below the Y-coupler pattern 400, as indicated in      such FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 4,270,130 to Houle et al. discloses the use of dyes in a      record disk that is grooved by a laser beam that forms a deformation      pattern therein, such dyes being deformed by ablation during groove      formation so as to render it transparent to such recording laser beam Such      beam can now be used, (even at an increased power level) for playback from      such recording without destroying the recorded deformation pattern. </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly the above prior art makes no suggestion of employing an      uncomplex process for forming clearly defined components for integrated      optics. However, there is need and market for a process that can fabricate      integrated optics including structures, circuits and components thereof,      that is streamlined rather than complex and otherwise overcomes the above      prior art shortcomings. </PAR><PAR>  There has now been discovered a simplified (and reduced temperature)      process for fabricating the above optics by locating a suitable polymer      and then selectively changing the index of refraction thereof to obtain      such optics. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Broadly the present invention provides a method of fabricating components      for integrated optics comprising irradiating a portion of a film of      soluble polydiacetlylene on a substrate, with light tuned within the      absorption band of such polymer, in air, to photobleach such film portion      while applying lesser or no bleaching to at least part of such film      adjacent such film portion, to reduce the refractive index of such film      portion below that of such film part, to define an optical component in      such lesser bleached portion. </PAR><PAR>  The invention further provides an integrated optic comprising a film of      soluble polydiacetylene including poly-4BCMU, on a substrate, which film      has a photobleached portion and a lesser or unbleached part, adjacent said      portion, said portion having a lesser index of refraction than said part      to provide a reflective interface or boundary therewith and to define an      optical component in said part. </PAR><PAR>  By &quot;poly-4BCMU&quot;, as used herein, is meant;      polyandlsqb;5,7-dodecadiyn-1,12-diol-bis(n-butoxycarbonyl-methylurethane)andrsqb;, which      polymer is a polydiacetylene. </PAR><PAR>  By &quot;lesser or unbleached (film) part&quot;, as used herein, is meant a film part      that is, e.g. under the edges of a mask and is less bleached than      irradiated film beyond the outlines of the mask but may be more bleached      than unbleached film including film well under such mask. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  The invention will become more apparent from the following detailed      specification and drawings in which: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a schematic sectional elevational view of a method embodying the      present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a perspective view of another photobleaching method embodying the      present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 3 and 4 are schematic sectional elevation views of a method embodying      the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 5, 6 and 7 are graphs illustrating certain examples of the method and      article of the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a schematic sectional elevation view of another method embodying      the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is a schematic sectional elevation view of another optical component      embodying the present invention; and, </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 is a perspective view of an integrated optic product embodying the      present invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  Referring in more detail to the drawings, argon laser 10 directs a laser      beam 12 through a focusing lens 14, which focuses a beam 16 onto a spot 18      of a polymer film 20 mounted on a glass substrate 22. The film is      irradiated a sufficient time to photobleach it, e.g. after several minutes      of irradiation , the laser beam bleaches the film and increasingly passes      therethrough and is received by a detector 24, as shown in FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  For purposes of the method of the present invention, it has been determined      that a certain type of polymer film lends itself to the formation of      integrated optics by the above photobleaching process It has been found      that films of polydiacetylene are suitable, of which poly-4BCMU is highly      suitable. That is, it has been found that thin film samples of poly-4BCMU      become transparent or bleach when irradiated with light tuned to the      absorption band of the sample. In addition the concomitant change in the      refractive index thereof is appreciable as discussed below. </PAR><PAR>  A suitable light is UV light which is broad-banded and can include      wavelengths, .lambda., of 200 nm to 440 nm or more, including .lambda. at      405 nm. </PAR><PAR>  The method of the present invention takes advantage of at least two      scientific principles. That is, 1) according to the invention, a selected      thin film is photobleached to reduce the index of refraction in a portion      thereof and 2) the so-reduced portion or portions of the film, provide      reflective boundaries or interfaces with the unbleached part or parts of      the film so as to define said parts as optical components, including      waveguides and gratings which are integral with such film. Such film can      be photobleached in a pattern e.g. with portions bleached on both sides of      an unbleached part, to define a channel or waveguide in such part. Other      optical components including phase gratings, can be formed in such film,      as more fully described below. </PAR><PAR>  By &quot;thin film(s)&quot;, as used herein, is meant films that are from 0.2 to 5.0      um thick, with a preferred range of 0.5 to 1.5 um, including about 1 um      thick. </PAR><PAR>  Here it is noted that the arrangement shown in FIGS. 1 and 4, is suited for      examining the change of physical properties in such film, before during      and after photobleaching, which changes are measured and shown in the      graphs of FIGS. 5, 6 and 7, as more fully discussed in the Examples given      below. </PAR><PAR>  In an another embodiment of the present invention, UV lamp 30 directs a      beam 32 through a collimating lens 34, forming a collimated beam 36, which      irradiates a poly-4BCMU film 38, mounted on a glass substrate 40, which      film is mounted below two optical channel-defining metal masks 42 and 44      on a glass plate 37, as shown in FIG. 2. Here, after sufficient      irradiation, the film 38 is photobleached on both sides of the masking      elements 42 and 44 reducing the index of refraction of the film, n.sub.f,      and providing reflective interfaces for the unbleached film parts under      the masking strips 42 and 44. These unbleached parts now have a higher      index of refraction than the bleached film portions and thus define      optical channels 80 and 82, as shown in the integrated film circuit 78 of      FIG. 10. Such film circuit 78 is more fully discussed below. </PAR><PAR>  A light beam can enter a waveguide in a film through the film edge as      discussed below with respect to FIG. 10. A light beam can also enter a      waveguide in a film, coming in at an angle with the surface of such film,      provided a coupling means or grating is provided in such film. In the      prior art grating couplers have been formed by, e.g. ion milling of ridges      and grooves either into the surface of the film above a channel or the      surface of such film or substrate below a channel, which grating can      couple a major portion of an incoming incident beam into the film channel,      the rest of the beam being reflected or transmitted as is known in the      prior art. Thus a grating 50 of ridges and grooves, having been milled      into a glass substrate 52, is covered with a polydiacetylene film 54, as      shown in FIG. 3. Such ridged and grooved phase grating is known as a      surface relief grating. When a beam 56 of a suitable wavelength, e.g.      .lambda.andequals;700 nm, per the graph of FIG. 6, more fully discussed below, is      directed at the grating 50, at a suitable incident angle .theta., most of      the beam will be coupled into a waveguide 58 of the film, the remainder of      the beam being reflected, absorbed or transmitted, as noted above. </PAR><PAR>  When the film above the grating 50 is irradiated by a light beam 60 (per      FIG. 4), tuned to the absorption band of such polymer film, that film      portion is photobleached (and made more transparent), which induces a      reduction in the refractive index of the polydiacetlylene film. </PAR><PAR>  This drop in refractive index can be measured since the incident angle at      which the above light beam 56 will couple into the waveguide of the film      54, is now reduced to angle .beta. with the incoming beam moved to the      position of arrow 61, as shown in FIG. 4. </PAR><PAR>  Thus the refractive index of the film is reduced with increasing exposure      to irradiation, as shown in FIG. 4 and the coupling incident angle of the      incoming beam to the grating 50 is accordingly reduced. </PAR><PAR>  As noted above, photobleaching of the polydiacetylene films by the method      of the present invention renders film that was opaque to light at certain      wavelengths, increasingly transparent, that is, the absorbance of such      wavelength is decreased by irradiation of such film by light tuned within      the absorption band thereof. Such change in absorbance is shown in the      graph of FIG. 6 wherein absorbance on the ordinate is plotted against      wavelength on the abscissa and curve 64 is the aborbance of such film      before irradiation, curve 66 is the absorption thereof during irradiation,      and curve 68 is the absorbance of such film after photobleaching. It can      be seen from the curve of 64 that such film is absorbant to light at      wavelengths of about 350 to 550 nm, i.e. is opaque to such wavelengths.      Accordingly such wavelengths cannot be transmitted in the unbleached      channels or waveguides of the film employed in the present invention since      they would be absorbed, as indicated in FIG. 6. However, light of      wavelengths of 600 nm and above, can be transmitted in the (unbleached)      film waveguides of the invention since the unbleached film is transparent      thereto. However, the remainder of the film, e.g. film 71 of FIG. 10, is      bleached on both sides of the respective waveguides 80 and 82, to provide,      as noted above, reflective interfaces or boundaries of lower indices of      refraction to keep the transmitted light in the respective waveguide 80 or      82. </PAR><PAR>  Returning now to FIG. 4, when the film 54, above the grating 50 is      irradiated by laser beam 60 at, e.g. 514.5 nm to photobleach such film,      the index of refraction thereof is progressively lowered for all      wavelengths above 600 nm and likely for wavelengths of 600 nm and below.      Thus the incoming light beam incident angle at a coupling grating, per      FIG. 4, will be reduced for all wavelengths above 600 nm and likely for      wavelengths 600 nm and below, as said grating is photobleached per the      method of the present invention. Accordingly progressive measurements of      the reduction of incident angle of a selected wavelength, e.g.      .lambda.andequals;1064 nm, can be made to calculate progressive reductions in the      index of refraction of such film, during irradiation, to provide a plot      thereof, such as shown in FIG. 7, as discussed more fully in Example III      below. </PAR><PAR>  While the surface relief grating 50 shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, can be employed      in the integrated optical circuits of the present invention, its use as      described with respect to FIG. 4, is for data-gathering purposes, e.g. for      the graph shown in FIG. 7. Similarly the arrangement shown in FIG. 1, of      irradiating such film with a focused laser beam (the progressive      transmission therethrough being read by a detector) is, e.g. used for      data-gathering purposes such as in the graph shown in FIG. 5, more fully      discussed below. </PAR><PAR>  In addition to defining optical channels by boundary photobleaching of such      film, the invention provides other optical components, including a grating      that does not require a physical reshaping, e.g. ion milling of film or      substrate. That is, the method of the invention provides for      photobleaching of a coupling grating in such film, herein denoted a phase      grating. </PAR><PAR>  Thus laser diode 70 directs laser beam 65 through a lens combination 71 to      produce a collimated light beam 72, as shown in FIG. 8. The collimated      beam 72 is split into two separate beams of equal intensity 74 and 75 by      an optical beamsplitter 73. Two mirrors 77 and 79, redirect the light      beams to optically interfere at a spot 81 in the polydiacetylene film 76,      which has been deposited onto a glass substrate 78. The relative angle of      the interfering beams is adjusted in order to define the periodicity of      the constructive and destructive interference zones, which provide a phase      grating of modulated refractive index 84, as shown in FIG. 8. Thus a light      beam 88, incoming at a suitable incident angle .alpha., is coupled by the      phase grating 84 into a waveguide in the film, as indicated by the arrow      90, shown in FIG. 9. </PAR><PAR>  However, the phase grating embodying the invention does not change its      coupling angle by photobleaching in the manner described above with      respect to FIGS. 3 and 4, since such photobleaching is detrimental to the      phase grating of the invention, itself formed by photobleaching of two      interfering beams, as noted above. </PAR><PAR>  An integrated optical circuit according to the invention, is shown in FIG.      10, wherein polydiacetylene film 71 is mounted on glass substrate 92 and      has lesser or unbleached waveguides 80 and 82, defined in such film 71. A      phase grating 94 in the film 71 optically connects with the waveguide 82,      as shown in FIG. 10. Preferably the phase grating 94 is fabricated in the      film 71, e.g. in the manner shown in FIG. 8, before the waveguides 80 and      82, which are then fabricated, e.g. per the method shown in FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  Also an optical fiber 104 connects with waveguide 82 and an optical fiber      106 connects with waveguide 80 at the film edge 73, as shown in FIG. 10.      For refractive index durability, the integrated optic circuit 78 is      encapsulated with an epoxy layer 108, which has a refractive index below      that of the lesser or unbleached waveguides 80 and 82 as does the glass      substrate 92, so that such waveguides are enclosed on all sides by      reflective interfaces of lower indices of refraction, as indicated in FIG.      10. </PAR><PAR>  In operation, a laser diode 110 directs through a lens 112, a laser beam      114 into the phase grating 94 to couple into the waveguide 82 and thence      to the optic fiber 104, as shown in FIG. 10. Concurrently or separately,      laser diode 116 directs through lens 118, laser beam 120 into waveguide      80, at the edge of the film 77 and thence to optic fiber 106, as shown in      FIG. 10. </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly, the methods of the present invention provide for fabricating      an integrated optical circuit of considerable compactness and versatility. </PAR><PAR>  Thus the invention provides methods to produce integrated optical      components including waveguides and phase gratings by irradiating      polydiacetylene films including poly-4BCMU, directly, with or without      masks through photolithographic processing. The photobleaching process      renders transparent such films and induces reduction in the refractive      index thereof as noted above. After exposure the photobleached product can      be stabilized by encapsulating the material as noted above. </PAR><PAR>  The following examples are intended to illustrate the invention and should      not be construed in limitation thereof. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE I </PAC><PAR>  Poly-4BCMU was mixed 5% by weight with cyclopentanone and dissolved into      solution by overnight heating (about 12 hours) at between 60.degree. to      100.degree. C., while continuously stirring the mixture. The solution was      spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 60 seconds onto clean microscope (glass) slide      substrates to form thin films (about 0.5 to 1.5 um thick). The film      samples were allowed to sit overnight (about 12 hours) to permit      evaporation of excess solvent. </PAR><PAR>  The spin-coated poly-4BCMU samples were exposed to an focused beam from an      argon laser (514.5 nm at 7.5 mW with 400 um FWHM). FWHM means full (beam)      width at half maximum (intensity). FIG. 5 shows the results of such      photobleaching where the transmission of such focused laser beam was      measured as a function of time. After irradiating for 300 seconds (about      1.8 kJ/cm.sup.2 total exposure) the transmitted intensity reached half the      saturation value as indicated in the graph of FIG. 5. Absorption spectra      of the film for various exposure energies are displayed in FIG. 6. </PAR><PAR>  When a mask was placed in close contact over the film in the path of the      laser beam, e.g. the observed transition between bleached and unbleached      bleached regions of the film were sharp. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE II </PAC><PAR>  Employing further spin-coated poly-4BCMU samples on glass substrates, made      in the manner described in Example 1, such films were irradiated with a      focused HeCd laser beam (442 nm at 1.35 mW with a 500 um FWHM). After      irradiating for about 230 seconds (about 160 J/cm.sup.2 exposure) the      transmitted intensity reached 50% of saturation value in the manner      indicated in the graph of FIG. 5. Again the observed transition between      bleached and unbleached regions of such film samples, was sharp. </PAR><PAR>  The same experiment was performed for a similar sample maintained in a      vacuum cell at a vacuum pressure of 300 millitorr. In this case, the      sample in the vacuum did not bleach after 14 hours of continuous      irradiation. However, after the vacuum cell was brought to atmospheric      pressure, the sample bleached in about 500 seconds when exposed to the      laser radiation. The increase in bleaching time is attributed to the film      having less O.sub.2 therein than normal. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE III </PAC><PAR>  A 630 nm period grating was masked and ion-milled into fused silica      substrate slides to form relief gratings therein. The 5% by weight      solution of poly-4 BCMU/cyclopentanone solution was deposited on such      slides and allowed to sit for 10 minutes to allow polymer concentration to      increase through solvent evaporation. The so-coated slides were then spun      at 300 rpm for about 30 seconds, leaving a thin layer of solution thereon.      The remaining solvent was allowed to evaporate, leaving a solution-cast      film about 4 um thick on such relief grating slides, such as shown in FIG.      3 hereof. The resulting film thickness had regions of good uniformity for      accurate coupling measurements. Coupling angles were measured using a      computer-controlled rotation stage and were obtained for three TE      polarized waveguide modes at 1.064 um or 1064 nm. </PAR><PAR>  The coupling spot was irradiated (e.g. as shown in FIG. 4) with 420 mW of      514 nm argon laser radiation and a 3 mm FWHM beam and coupling angles were      measured after irradiation. The process was repeated with the same spot      being periodically irradiated and such coupling angles being measured      thereafter. The refractive indices and film thicknesses were obtained by      inverting the waveguide dispersion relation, assuming a planar waveguide      geometry. The results of these measurements, showing a decrease in      refractive index with increasing irradiation are shown in the graph of      FIG. 7. </PAR><PAR>  As shown, the refractive index of the exposed poly-4BCMU film was reduced      by as much 0.029 at .lambda.andequals;1.064 um while the thickness remained      unchanged. This refractive index change is sufficient to write channels      and phase gratings in such film. Further it has been found that by heating      (with stirring) the solution of Example I, for a shorter period than given      in such Example, e.g. for 1 hour at 60.degree. to 100.degree. C., then      allowing it to cool to room temperature (about 20.degree. C.) With      stirring, for 3 to 4 more hours, then spin coating the solution onto glass      slides per Example I, that the resulting polymer film has a sufficiently      higher refractive index so as to reduce, by photobleaching by up to 0.08      (down to about 1.49 for such bleached film). As indicated above, the      channels are written by irradiating and photobleaching films of soluble      polydiacetlylene with portions thereof being masked to provide unbleached      channels or waveguides, as discussed above. The phase gratings are formed      by directing interfering laser beams to a coupling spot on such film, as      previously discussed above and below. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE IV </PAC><PAR>  A phase grating with period .lambda.andequals;1.7 um was formed in spin-coated      poly-4BCMU thin film. This was done by directing a pair of interfering      argon laser beams at a coupling spot on the film, each at an opposite      angle of 19 degrees with the film surface, at .lambda.andequals;514.5 nm, with an      intensity of 30 mW for 300  seconds. Thus by the method shown, e.g. in      FIG. 8, a phase grating was quickly and readily inscribed in such film. </PAR><PAR>  Thereafter, a channel or waveguide connecting with such grating was formed      in the poly-4BCMU film by covering a portion thereof connecting with such      grating, with a metalized mask and exposing the film with an ultraviolet      source(HTG LS-60 UV light source system), for 15 minutes, at about 20      W/cm.sup.2 in the manner indicated in FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, in the manner shown in FIG. 8, a phase grating was readily and      quickly inscribed in such polymer film, followed by installation of a      connecting waveguide to quickly provide integrated optical components per      the method of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  As noted above, the invention provides for photobleaching polydiacetylene      film to provide integrated optics at low cost. Preferred are films of      poly-4BCMU. </PAR><PAR>  Such films are preferably deposited on transparent substrates such as      glass. Such films can be irradiated per the method of the invention by      laser beam, white light or UV light depending upon the application      thereof. Of course gratings are formed in such film by interfering two      laser beams at a coupling spot on the film, as discussed above. </PAR><PAR>  The benefit of the photobleaching of such film is that it lowers the      refractive index of such film on both sides of the unbleached channel so      as to keep an applied or coupled light beam in such channel by reflectance      at the interfaces thereof. And gratings are added to such integrated      circuit as discussed above. </PAR><PAR>  Per the graph of FIG. 6, such unbleached channels will accept and not      absorb wavelengths greater than 600 nm which render such integrated      optics, including phase gratings, waveguides and optical interconnects,      highly suitable for communication wavelengths, which are within the range      of, e.g. 1300 to 1500 nm. </PAR><PAR>  As noted above, various lights can be employed to bleach such film provided      it be tuned within the absorption band of such film. Thus, looking at FIG.      6, it can be seen that an (unfocused) argon laser beam tuned to 514.5 nm      is of suitable wavelength to bleach such film. </PAR><PAR>  Of course as the channels are lesser or unbleached portions of the film,      the light transmitted therein must be of a wavelength greater than 600 nm      to render such channels transparent thereto, as discussed above. </PAR><PAR>  Thus photo-induced bleaching can occur by exposing spin-coated or solution      cast soluble polydiacetylene films, e.g. poly-4BCMU in open air, to light      tuned to within the adsorption band of the polymer. This effect is      believed caused by oxidation of the poly-4BCMU. This effect can be quite      useful because refractive index changes of 0.029 (or more) allow      integrated optic components and circuits to be formed directly, by proper      exposure of such polymer film. The novel methods of the invention also      provide novel products, i.e. the integrated optics including the      components thereof, such as phase gratings and optical channels or      waveguides. Encapsulating the exposed film after removal of residual gas      therein, stabilizes the integrated optical products from further      bleaching. </PAR><PAR>  Thus the methods of the invention can lead to low cost, low temperature,      single step fabrication of integrated optical patterns for integrated      optics, optical interconnects, non linear, integrated optics and passive      linear, integrated, optical circuits. In addition there are applications      in the area of low-cost polymer, read-write heads for optical data storage     . </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
