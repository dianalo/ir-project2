Swatting Song'sglasses off his face, the man began choking him, shouting, &quot;We are bigAmericans. . . . We don't need you small (expletive) Oriental boys here.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MAN'S LAWSUIT MARKS LOCAL HATE-CRIME MILESTONE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Song complained to police, and Joseph W. Gipson was convicted of assaultand battery on June 7, and put on probation. In most such instances, thatwould have been the end of it. But now, Song is trying to collect damages fromGipson under a little-known law called the Ralph Act.;    It's all part ofwhat some prosecutors and community activists call a growing effort to counterhate crimes against homosexuals, blacks and other minority group members inthe Bay Area. While prosecutors generally favor criminal sanctions inhate-crime matters, because they consider prison penalties the most effectivedeterrent, victims have begun using the Ralph Act's simpler burden of proof topress their cases. Moreover, by assessing monetary damages, the Ralph Act isseen as an additional way to make bigots pay for their abusiveness.;   Although the Ralph Act has been around since the mid-1980s, it remainedvirtually unused until the past few months. Then, in March, the San FranciscoDistrict Attorney's Office filed what it claimed was the first such civil casein the state against a 65-year-old man, whom it accused of conducting asix-year campaign of terror against a Puerto Rican family.;    Song's is thefirst suit filed under the act's provisions in Santa Clara County, as far aslocal authorities can determine.;    Anastasia Steinberg, who specializes insuch cases for the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office, said shealso is considering a possible Ralph Act suit.;    And Dennis Hayashi, anattorney with Asian Law Caucus, which filed the case on behalf of Song, saidhis office is &quot;getting ready to do another one&quot; in connection with a recentSan Francisco incident.;    Song's lawsuit &quot;was more or less formulatedbecause of the increasing anti-Asian violence that we're seeing nationally andlocally,&quot; Hayashi said. Besides, he added, Song &quot;felt very strongly about theracial aspects of the case.&quot;;    &quot;My basic motivation is not to have this kindof thing happen again,&quot; said the 31-year-old Song, a native of South Korea.Even though he has lived in America for eight years and is a U.S. citizen,Song said Gipson &quot;made me feel like I should go back.&quot;;    Although Song'slawsuit doesn't specify how much damage he suffered, it claimed the Jan. 12attack at Spring Valley Golf Course forced him to seek physical therapy andpsychiatric help.;    Gipson, who reportedly lives in the Southern Californiacommunity of Apple Valley, could not be reached for comment.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  STEVE JOHNSON, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910618  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  498  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday June 18, 199100170154,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
