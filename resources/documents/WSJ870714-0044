The purchase is subject to a definitive agreement and Federal Communications Commission approval, among other conditions, Outlet said. The radio station is WASH.    Outlet, which operates television and radio stations, said that it intends to sell its WMMJ-FM radio station in Bethesda, Md., to comply with FCC rules. FCC rules prohibit ownership of more than two radio stations in the same market. The company also owns and operates WTOP-AM in Washington.    &quot;The purchase of WASH strengthens our presence in Washington and is our first acquisition since going public again,&quot; said Bruce Sundlun, Outlet chairman and chief executive officer.    Outlet, which was acquired by the Rockefeller Group in 1984, went private in a leveraged buyout in 1986. The company went public again in January, with an offering of 1.35 million common shares. </TEXT></DOC>
