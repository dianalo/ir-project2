Each of them has a width of 30 degrees and consistsof 1 m/s classes in speed. Weibull distributions were approximated inall cases, and extrapolated down to a frequency of exceedance of 'oncein 50 years' (a mean return period of 50 years). As the gust directionis not available, the assumption had to be made, that it does not deviatemore than 15 degrees from the hourly mean direction. Four sites showa distinct ducting of lower winds by hills and valleys perpendicularto the main wind direction. As expected, ducting is largely reduced inextreme gusts. Highest values are always combined with westerly directions.Nevertheless considerable differences over Germany are given. The directionof the maximal 50 years' gusts varies among the 10 sites between 220and 290 degrees, the mean value is 260 degrees. The 50 years' gusts donot fall off rapidly on both sides of the maximum. The angular sectioncontaining 50 years' gusts with more than 84% of the maximum gust speedis often broader than 90 degrees. (84% in gust speed corresponds to 70%in velocity pressure). This angular section varies considerably. Thus,when the main gust direction would be prescribed to be 260 degrees, thereduction in wind load (velocity pressure) on the perpendicular axiscould not be more than 30%. Considering the statistical insecurity ofthe extrapolated 50 years' gusts (+- 3 m/s) it certainly must be evenless.</TEXT></DOC>
