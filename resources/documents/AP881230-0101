The U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said theunidentified scholar, who teaches at a small college, was approachedby an Iranian who has a low-level job in the foreign or justiceministry in Tehran.   The United States and Iran have had no diplomatic relations since1979 when militants seized and sacked the U.S. embassy, taking theAmericans there hostage. Most were held for 444 days before beingreleased.   Currently, there are nine American hostages in Lebanon, all heldby a pro-Iranian group, according to the department'scounter-terrorism office.   President Reagan in 1985 secretly approved delivery of U.S. andIsraeli weapons to Iran in an effort to encourage moderation in theTehran government and also to try to facilitate the release ofcaptive Americans.   The Congressional and public uproar that developed when thepurchases became known in 1986 prompted the State Department toinsist on a public discussion with Tehran.   ``Given our past experience in dealing with people who purport torepresent the Iranian government, it's clear we need to speak tosomeone openly and up-front, someone in an authoritative position,''the U.S. official said.   Several indirect overtures from Iran were received in the pastand did not produce a substantive diplomatic dialogue betweenWashington and Tehran. However, the United States is able to talkindirectly to the Iranian government through a number of foreigncountries, including Algeria, Japan and West Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
