DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan vetoed a $299.5 billionPentagon budget bill Wednesday, charging congressional Democratswith partisan politics and saying the bill would signal ``weaknessand accommodation'' in U.S. defense policy.   Although the bill has become entangled in election-year politicsand leading Republicans had urged the president to veto it, Reagandisavowed any political motives.   ``These are issues of national security and they must remainabove partisan politics,'' he said.   ``The partisan politics is on the other side,'' he added.   The bill essentially would have authorized the spending levelsReagan sought, but sought to rearrange spending priorities.Administration officials complained that the legislation containedlanguage that would have tied the president's hands on future armscontrol negotiations with the Soviet Union.   Reagan also objected to the bill on grounds it would ``cripplethe very concept'' behind Star Wars, his space-based missiledefense system.   The president made his announcement after walking into the WhiteHouse press briefing room with a copy of the bulky bill in hishands.   ``The bill would signal a basic change in the direction of ournational defense,'' he said. ``A change away from strength andproven success and back toward weakness and accommodation of the1970s.''   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., responding to the veto, saidReagan ``faces a difficult test between now and November tomaintain a proper separation between his roles as president andpolitical campaigner. On this issue, he should not have abdicatedhis responsibility to the country as president andcommander-in-chief _ he should have signed the defense bill.''   Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the third-ranking Democrat in theHouse, noted that Vice President George Bush had supported the vetoand said, ``If he wants (Pentagon mismanagement) debated for thenext few months, that is all right with us. George Bush wants toplay politics. The defense veto will come back to haunt them.''Bush is the certain Republican presidential nominee.   The veto may be difficult to override in theDemocratic-controlled Congress, particularly in the House. Itpassed both chambers July 14, by votes generally along party lines.The vote was 229-183 in the House and 64-30 in the Senate. It takesa two-thirds vote of both houses to override.   Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala., ranking Republican on the ArmedServices Committee, said, ``I expect there will be an overrideattempt, but I think we will sustain the president's veto.'' Hecalled it a ``bad bill.''   Senate GOP leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said Reagan made ``the rightdecision ... for only one reason _ the right reason: the bill doesnot serve the national security interests of the United States.''   Reagan said the bill would mean ``unilateral concessions to theSoviets _ concessions that would reduce my bargaining leverage atthe conference table at the very moment when that leverage hasproduced its most fruitful results,'' the president said.   ``I have been patient as the liberals in Congress attempted toerode our military strength, the strength that has provided thebasis for our diplomatic success,'' he said. ``But I can be patientno longer. Congress needs to get back to work and come up with abill I can sign.''   When asked whether he expected Congress to produce a bill beforeadjourning, the president replied that the defense appropriationsbill now being considered, a separate bill that actually providesthe Defense Department with the funds authorized in the vetoedmeasure, ``is one that I could sign and would sign.'' He did notelaborate, but the appropriations bill contains fewer arms controlrestrictions than the authorization measure.   Reagan said the authorization bill would also have crippled theconcept behind Star Wars, or the Strategic Defense Initiative, ofcreating a space shield against nuclear attack.   ``And I will not abide this _ particularly in view of thetechnical progress that SDI is making,'' he said.   ``They say this bill would take the `stars' out of Star Wars,''said Reagan. ``With my veto today, I am putting back the `I',initiative, in SDI.''   ``We know there is a partisan position in which there are agreat many there who just don't want SDI at all,'' he said. ``Well,I think they are bucking the tide.''   The Strategic Defense Initiative would receive $4 billion in thebill, slightly more than the current SDI budget of $3.9 billion butfar less than the $4.8 billion Reagan wanted.   In addition, the bill reduces spending for a space-basedinterceptor that is under development as the first phase of aneventual SDI program. The Pentagon wanted $330 million, but thebill restricts the total to $85 million.   The measure requires retirement of three aging, missile-firingPoseidon submarines as new subs are built, continuing a policy ofgenerally keeping the United States near weapons limits imposed bythe unratified SALT II nuclear treaty. Reagan opposes this policy.   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, who is visiting the SovietUnion, said in a statement released at the Pentagon that he fullysupported the veto.   As passed, the legislation was ``seriously flawed'' because ofthe arms control restrictions and provisions reducing funding forStar Wars and modernization of nuclear missiles, Carlucci said.   ``These concerns were expressed to the Congress over the pasttwo months, and I regret that they were not accommodated in thebill presented to the president,'' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
