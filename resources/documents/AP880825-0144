Rowan, who has been accused of using anunregistered handgun to wound a teen-age trespasser at his home.   A District of Columbia Superior Court hearing commissioner, RoyT. Ellis, agreed to put off until Sept. 12 a hearing on dismissingcharges, to give prosecutors time to study the matter. Cityattorneys said they would file papers within a week opposingRowan's request that the charges be dropped.   Rowan's attorney, Raoul L. Carroll, asked last week that thecharges be dismissed, saying he had evidence that Rowan and hisson, Carl Jr., had been told they didn't have to register theweapon used in the June 14 shooting.   The columnist, who has written in favor of gun control, has beencharged with one count each of possessing an unregistered gun andcarrying ammunition for it. Each misdemeanor charge carries apossible penalty of one year in prison and a $1,000 fine.   A local ordnance enacted in 1976 requires that all handguns beregistered.   But Rowan and his son, a former FBI agent who owned the.22-caliber pistol, contend they had been told the weapon did notneed to be registered because law enforcement personnel were exempt.   That statement was supported by a memo written Aug. 11 from cityCorporation Counsel Frederick D. Cooke to Police Chief Maurice T.Turner indicating that some police officers have erred in enforcingthe gun registration law.   ``It has come to my attention that some officers in the MPD(Metropolitan Police Department) have interpreted the provision soas to exempt from registration firearms owned by MPD officers orother law enforcement officers,'' Cooke wrote Turner.   ``I understand further that when an officer ceases to be an MPDor other law enforcement officer this `exempt' status is notrevoked and the former officer is not required to surrender theweapon,'' Cooke continued.   ``I do not agree with (the) premise that law enforcementofficers are exempt from registration of any non-department weaponsthey may own.''   The law should be amended to make clear that law enforcementofficers are not exempt from the city's stringent handgun law,Cooke added.   Carroll, who submitted the memo in his dismissal motion, said itsubstantiates the claims of innocence his client has already made.   Beverly Burke, a spokeswoman for the corporation counsel,refused to comment on the memo, and refused to outline how the citywill counter Rowan's request.</TEXT></DOC>
