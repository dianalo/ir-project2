<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-89-0476 </DOCNO><TEXT>For the use with the Vivitron, it is proposed to add a third beam lineto the present two lines of the MP-HVEC tandem injector. This new linewill consist mainly of the negative ion source, a preacceleration stageof 80 kV and a magnetic analysing dipole with a mass resolving powerdm/m andgt; 1/200. With this set up a satisfactory injection energy of 250keV can be obtained.</TEXT></DOC>
