The agreement, signed late Friday, would be the largest takeover in Canadian history and make Chicago-based Amoco's Amoco Canada Petroleum Co. unit Canada's second-largest oil producer. Dome, which currently has $6.1 billion (Canadian) of debt, said the acquisition is contingent on approval by Dome's lenders and shareholders as well as by Canadian regulators.    TransCanada, which had bid $4.3 billion for Dome, immediately declared it was not giving up its fight for the Calgary, Alberta-based oil and gas producer. &quot;We've improved our original proposal, and we've told Dome we're still prepared to negotiate,&quot; said Gerald J. Maier, TransCanada's president and chief executive officer.    Sources close to the bidding said Exxon dropped out last Wednesday evening after a bidding battle began between Amoco and TransCanada. Amoco officials declined to say whether the agreement includes an indemnification fee for Amoco if the pact falls through.    Amoco's agreement with Dome is expected to spark a political storm in Canada, because of the high degree of foreign ownership in the Canadian oil industry and Amoco's apparent U.S. tax advantages. Amoco, the fifth-largest U.S. oil company ranked by revenue, appeared to be making a special effort to pacify potential political opposition by releasing word of its accord through its Calgary-based Amoco Canada unit.    Amoco also stressed it won't seek any special tax concessions from the Canadian government.    Canadian oil industry analyst Ian Doig said that if Dome is sold to Amoco, Canadian ownership in the country's oil and gas industry would fall to about 40%, from 49%, based on revenue.    &quot;It's a dark day for Canada,&quot; said Ed Broadbent, leader of the national New Democratic Party.    TransCanada is expected to exert public pressure to win government support for its takeover bid. &quot;We intend to pursue every avenue open to us to acquire Dome's assets,&quot; said Mr. Maier of TransCanada, a Toronto-based natural gas pipeline company.    Neil Nichols, TransCanada's chief financial officer, said the company is considering sidestepping Dome's management by making an offer directly to Dome's shareholders and creditors. He also said TransCanada &quot;will do everything in its power to prevent Investment Canada from approving the Amoco transaction.&quot; Investment Canada is a federal government agency that screens foreign investment in Canada.    Sources close to TransCanada said U.S. tax laws gave Amoco a substantial tax benefit in its bid that TransCanada was unable to obtain from Canada's finance ministry. The sources said that under U.S. tax laws, Amoco can deduct from its taxes a portion of the purchase price of acquiring Dome. One source said the tax savings in future years to Amoco could be as high as $600 million (Canadian).    TransCanada last week asked Canadian officials for a similar tax treatment. &quot;We're disappointed they didn't consider our request,&quot; one source said. Another added that &quot;it was incongruous to us that an American company had a bigger tax advantage than a Canadian company.&quot;    Amoco officials said it is still unclear how they will structure the acquisition in terms of U.S. tax law. The company said the merger would generate enough cash flow to satisfy Amoco Canada's financial obligations and allow the company to expand its Canadian exploration and production.    Amoco's officials said they believed their major advantage lay in the substantial numbers of joint ventures between Amoco Canada and Dome. &quot;That allowed us to compare Dome's figures with our own on properties we knew about, and gave us a comfort margin when we evaluated the holdings we didn't know first hand,&quot; said an Amoco official. In 1986, Amoco Canada had assets of about $1 billion and earnings of $94 million on revenue of $521 million, all in U.S. dollars.    Under the agreement, Dome's commonshare holders would receive $1.50 a share (Canadian) in Amoco Canada debt securities, which can be exchanged for common shares of Amoco Corp. Class A, B and C preferred-share holders of Dome would get $7 a share in the exchangeable debt securities. This would give holders of Dome's 340.5 million common a total $510.8 million in Amoco securities, and holders of the 5.8 million preferred shares would receive $40.3 million.    After shareholders are paid, under Amoco's bid, Dome's 54 creditors would divide the remaining $4.55 billion. That amount would be paid in a combination of cash and debt securities.    Aside from shareholder and government approval, Amoco's bid is conditional on creditors accepting the $4.55 billion debt repayment, which falls short of the total $6.1 billion of debt owed by Dome. The gap could result in significant write-downs for as many as eight banking groups that make up Dome's major lenders.    Senior Amoco officials said they plan to meet with Dome's major lenders within weeks. &quot;Arithmetic tells you they will have to accept less than the principal amount of the loans,&quot; said a senior Amoco official, who wouldn't be named. But he said the lenders will fare better under Amoco's offer than under either bankruptcy-law proceedings or a recapitalization plan put forth by Dome. &quot;If you believe that there is any way all Dome's existing debt will be serviced under one of those plans, you'll believe in the tooth fairy,&quot; he said.    Dome has been negotiating with creditors to refinance its debt, because last year's collapse in oil and gas prices left the company unable to meet all its debt payments. In 1986, Dome had a $2.2 billion loss on revenue of $1.5 billion. The loss included a $2.1 billion write-down on assets.    TransCanada had offered shareholders $430 million in cash and securities. Creditors were offered $3.87 billion in cash and securities, with secured creditors entitled to as much as an additional $1 billion in oil-indexed debentures tied to Dome's future profits.    TransCanada sources said the company last week sweetened its offer, but was rebuffed by Dome because the bid was conditional on a favorable tax ruling. One source said TransCanada's last offer totaled about $4.4 billion, with the additional $100 million earmarked for creditors. &quot;We were ready to carry on with negotiations, but we were told (by Dome) that we wouldn't be welcome,&quot; the source said.    Exxon, which also had submitted a takeover proposal, dropped out of the bidding for Dome last Wednesday evening. &quot;They hadn't been working on it as long as everyone else and they didn't want to deal under pressure,&quot; said a source close to the talks.    Exxon and its Canadian unit, Imperial Oil Ltd., Canada's largest oil producer, have declined to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
