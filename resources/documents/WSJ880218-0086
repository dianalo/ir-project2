Hispanics, clearly, are not an easy group to target. Yet an increasing number of major companies are courting the Hispanic consumer. To these companies, Hispanics -- the second fastest-growing population group in the U.S. -- is a market that can't be ignored.    Last fall, the Census Bureau reported that since 1980, the country's Hispanic population had increased by 30%, to 18.8 million from 14.5 million -- five times the growth rate of non-Hispanics. And although the Hispanic advertising market is still small at $491 million, it grew 23% last year, according to Hispanic Business magazine.    &quot;Anybody who looks at the size of the Hispanic consumer segment would have to be nuts not to do business there,&quot; says Charles E. Morrison, a vice president of Coca-Cola USA, a unit of Coca-Cola Co.    Other companies agree. In the past year such major marketers as Pillsbury Co.'s Burger King Corp., Southland Corp.'s 7-Eleven Stores, and Domino's Pizza Inc. began comprehensive Spanish-language advertising campaigns for the first time.    Coca-Cola has used such Hispanic celebrities as Los Angeles Dodger pitching star Fernando Valenzuela, while Pepsi Cola has featured the Miami Sound Machine. In Miami, the wealthiest Latin enclave in the U.S., American Express Co. plans to feature prominent Hispanics in a Spanish-language version of its Portraits campaign.    And Campbell, aside from promoting its soup, is making a major push into the Hispanic market with a line of Caribbean-type foods. The company plans to sell over 50 items under the Casera label, going head-to-head with Goya Foods Inc., the Secaucus, N.J., concern that dominates that market with estimated 1987 sales of about $275 million. Campbell also has begun test-marketing some Mexican food items in California under the Casera label.    &quot;It's a population whose importance can't be denied any longer,&quot; says Liz Castells, product manager for Campbell Soup's Hispanic food unit. &quot;That's the bottom line.&quot;    Spanish-speaking television is flourishing as well -- providing better opportunities to reach the Hispanic audience. Since last August, a partnership of Hallmark Cards Inc. and a unit of First Chicago Corp. have spent more than $500 million to purchase 10 Spanish-language television stations as well as a television network. The acquisition of an eleventh network is pending. A partnership managed by Saul Steinberg's Reliance Group Holdings Inc. has spent around $325 million to form its own rival network.    Another sign of the emergence of the Hispanic market is the interest of mainstream advertising agencies, many of which are either starting up their own Spanish-language shops or acquiring existing agencies. Last December, the British giant, WPP Group PLC, bought Newport Beach, Calif.-based Mendoza, Dillon andamp; Asociados, the largest independent Hispanic ad agency in the country with 1987 billings of $36 million.    &quot;They are getting heat from clients,&quot; Edward Fitch, a senior editor at Advertising Age, says of the agencies. His magazine recently began a two-page monthly section on the Hispanic market to satisfy greater reader interest.    Still, it's an embryonic market and some agencies remain unconvinced of its importance. It also isn't an easy market to understand -- or crack.    The Hispanic population, for instance, is highly concentrated, which might seem to make a wide-reaching national ad campaign fairly easy to execute. Fifty-four percent live in just two states -- Texas and California. According to Strategy Research Inc., a Miami market research firm, 32.8% live in seven other states.    But the concentration is a bit deceiving. Mexican-Americans make up about 63% of U.S. Hispanics and dominate the market in California and the Southwest. Cubans are a far smaller group, but their higher income and heavy concentration in South Florida make Miami the country's most important Hispanic media market, after Los Angeles. New York, the nation's third-richest Hispanic market, has significant Dominican and Puerto Rican populations.    &quot;We are just a bunch of segmented markets within a large market,&quot; says Carlos Rossi, the Puerto Rican president of New York-based Conill Advertising Inc., who helped to design the Campbell ads.    Some companies use one ad for the entire Hispanic community. But others, like Campbell Soup, opt for a varied ad campaign in an effort to reach specific audiences. What plays to Caribbean Hispanics, they find, doesn't necessarily work with Mexican-Americans.    The Campbell ads, for instance, all feature a woman cooking but differ in such details as the age of the character, the setting and the music. The version for Caribbean Hispanics has a grandmother cooking in a plant-filled kitchen to the sounds of salsa and merengue. The Mexican-American ad shows a young wife, preparing food in a brightly colored &quot;southwestern-style&quot; kitchen, with pop music playing in the background, according to Mr. Rossi.    The choice of language isn't even a simple decision. Although most Hispanics prefer to speak Spanish, many younger, more-affluent Hispanics prefer English, which is dominant in such key markets as San Antonio and Albuquerque.    Despite the difficulties, though, many companies are determined to tap the Hispanic market. For some, in fact, it's become a necessity, as their products have gone out of fashion in other markets.    Hispanics, for example, use three to four times as much cooking oil as increasingly health-conscious non-Hispanics. As a result, Hispanics account for over 20% of Mazola's sales. Last year, when ad budgets were tight, CTC International Inc., the Englewood Cliffs, N.J.-based company that makes Mazola, spent more money advertising the oil in the Hispanic market than in the general market, says Michael Lyons, group product manager for Mazola oil and margarine. &quot;One million dollars in the Hispanic market,&quot; says Mr. Lyons, &quot;will take you further than $10 million in the general market.&quot;    ---                    Leading Cities   Biggest markets in terms of money spent on Hispanic advertising, in millions of dollars.
