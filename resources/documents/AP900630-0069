American Airlines begins taking over Eastern's Latin Americanservice in the largest chopping yet on the struggling carrier. Inthe first of four phases in the takeover, American starts serviceto Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica and Guatemala.   By mid-August, American will have Eastern's routes to 20 citiesin 15 Latin nations.   For American, the Latin routes are a major step in thefast-growing, Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier's effort to become aleading worldwide airline. The carrier is holding ribbon-cuttingceremonies, including a new Miami-London route, and spending anestimated $20 million in promoting its new service.   For Eastern, the transfer means badly needed cash.   With the airline still struggling to emerge from Chapter 11bankruptcy reorganization after 16 months, there's little time forsentiment as Eastern hands over one of its prize possessions. Itwas the same last year when Eastern's trademark Northeast shuttleservice was sold to New York developer Donald Trump.   When the Latin transfer is completed, the Miami-based airlinewill no longer have a hub in Miami, where daily service will bedown to about two dozen flights.   ``Obviously, this a tough one. There are a lot of sentimentalties for Eastern employees,'' said company spokeswoman KarenCeremsak. ``It's very difficult, as was parting with the shuttle,but it's all necessary. Although it will be a bitter pill toswallow, we all know it's better for the airline in the long term.''   Eastern on Friday received $120 million from American, and thebalance of the $310 million sale price will be received as thetransfers are completed. That will bring to near $1 billion theamount in assets sales for Eastern since it went into Chapter 11.   Ms. Ceremsak said the only other major asset sale contemplatedis the effort to peddle Eastern's 14 L-1011 aircraft.   Eastern has set no deadline for emerging from Chapter 11.Earlier such deadlines were missed repeatedly, leading to acreditors' call for replacement of the parent Texas Air Corp.management (now Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.). The federalbankruptcy court appointed Martin Shugrue to run Eastern as atrustee on April 12.   Eastern is trying to find jobs either within its system or withother carriers for the 150 Miami-based employees whose positions,half of them part time, are being cut with the Latin transfer.American is absorbing foreign Eastern employees, while Eastern has200 flight attendants and 150 pilots who will move to other routesfrom the Latin system.   Before the March 4, 1989, Machinists union strike that spurredthe Chapter 11 filing, Eastern had nearly 100 daily Miami flights.   Less than 10 years ago, Eastern had more passengers than anyother U.S. carrier, leading to its claim of being No. 1 in the FreeWorld.   Eastern still flies to Cancun, Mexico, Puerto Rico and otherCaribbean points, although it has cut back on Caribbean service inrecent years.   The Latin routes, which Eastern bought from Braniff in 1982 foronly $30 million, are ``inherently profitable,'' Ms. Ceremsak said.``We have not been able to reap those benefits because of oursituation.''   American's Miami growth is a challenge to Pan American WorldAirways, which is also losing money. Pan Am has been flying toLatin America since its first passenger service 63 years ago fromKey West, Fla., to Havana. Pan Am had 3 million passengers on Latinroutes last year, double Eastern's passengers.</TEXT></DOC>
