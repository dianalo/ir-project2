The black problems of disaffection, displacement, despair,resentment, feelings of injustice and lack of hope were thereseething, but far from the national spotlight or from immediatelocal concern.   Then the confusing fatal police shooting of a black motorcycliston the Monday night of Martin Luther King Day, provided the sparkthat quickly brought smouldering tensions to a fiery rage of violentdisturbances lasting three days.   Now black leaders, offended by the initial local focusing on theriot's damage to Miami's Super Bowl image instead of the reasonsbehind it, say the question to them hadn't been ``Why?'' blackserupted again, as they did in 1980 riots and disturbances in 1982and 1984.   It was ``When?''   ``Here we are once again,'' said Willie Sims, who has served onthe Dade County Community Relations Board since the 1980 riotingaftermath. ``The black community takes all these negatives and theystore them and you've got the powder keg. It's just a question ofwho would detonate it.''   ``It is almost elementary now,'' said a weary-sounding GarthReeves Sr., publisher of the black-oriented Miami Times newspaper.``We keep hoping we learn from the past; hopefully, we're comingaround to redressing our grievances.''   Much has changed about Miami since it last was host to a SuperBowl 10 years earlier. There is a colorful new downtown skyline, amodern people-mover system, a Bayside marketplace of shops andrestaurants, a new downtown convention center and three new luxuryhotels; a new $50 million basketball arena. And the football gameitself will be played in a new stadium north of the city.   A ``Cubanization'' of Miami has transformed it from a southern,tourism-based resort to a thriving center of Latin commerce, asrefugees from Fidel Castro's revolution stopped being exiles andexerted financial, social and political influence.   The transformation, though, swept past blacks, who account forbetween 20 percent and 25 percent of the county's nearly 1.8 millionresidents. Hispanics _ chiefly Cubans _ account for about 40 percent.   Blacks saw their neighborhoods carved up for new buildings androads and felt themselves slipping in the city's new tri-ethnicstructure: from perhaps second to the whites who had run Miami, tothird.   ``It's like standing on shore and looking at a body of water,watching the high tide constantly receding from you over a period of10 years,'' said Arthur Teele, a black attorney. ``What you have inMiami today is a community that has grown dynamically in a wayperhaps no other city has ever grown, and in a short time. And whatyou have had is a squeezing out of the black community; socially,economically, politically.''   A listing in The Miami Herald last year of the city's powerbrokers was filled with Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites (calledAnglos here). City listings of ethnic ownership of businesses haveput black ownership in single-digit percentages.   Black unemployment in Dade County in 1987 was 10.4 percent,nearly double that of the two other ethnic groups. Black youthunemployment in neighborhoods such as Overtown was estimated at 40percent to 50 percent.   Jobs haven't been coming in to the black community, but crackcocaine has, and that has compounded crime.   Sims' agency compiles a weekly neighborhood ``tension chart,''using reports from its own staff and some 150 volunteers, rangingfrom county judges to bus drivers, who are in daily contact with theblack comunity.   Using reports on police incidents, crime and what people aretalking about, plus their own experience and sense of the community,the Community Relations Board staffers assign black neighborhoodsnumbers from 1 to 5 and watch for areas that stay near the crisislevel of 5.   ``The levels were staying high,'' Sims said. ``That's anindication of something seriously wrong.''   Sims last month became alarmed by a startling series ofsimilarities to community concerns in 1980 before the riots thatkilled 18 and did hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage.   In late December, he said, his staff wrote to the chiefs of theMiami and Metro-Dade police department and listed comparisons.   For example, in 1980, several black officials were under fire,most notably Dade County School Superintendent Johnny L. Jones wholost his job in March 1980 after being charged with grand theft foralleged misuse of school funds. A later conviction was overturned onappeal, but Jones eventually served time for solicitation of perjury.   In 1988, several black officials were under fire, including U.S.District Judge Alcee L. Hastings, who was acquitted in a 1983bribery trial but has been impeached by the U.S. House.   As in 1980, when the Metro-Dade Police Department was recoveringfrom the indictments and trial of former officers accused of helpinga cocaine kingpin, 1988 saw Miami police struggling after theindictments and trials of officers accused of running a drug ripoffring.   In both years, Sims said, there were several instances ofcontroversial police shootings of black suspects and wrong-houseraids; one before the 1980 riots involved a former blackschoolteacher, while one this year involved a black minister.   Deep-seated economic and social problems were combining withfeelings that black officials were being singled out forpersecution, that police couldn't be trusted and that they wereunfairly violent to blacks, Sims said as he reviewed the CommunityRelations Board letter dated Dec. 23.   After that letter, a federal judge in Texas ruled that CentralAmerican immigrants couldn't be forced to stay near the border whileawaiting U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service action on theirasylum requests. That led this month to a ``buslift'' of hundreds ofCentral Americans, most Nicaraguans, to Miami.   The Cuban community, identifying with Latin refugees fleeing aMarxist homeland, opened up their pocketbooks with donations to helpthe Nicaraguans amid predictions the 100,000-strong Nicaraguan exilecommunity could double by year's end.   To some blacks, who had seen more than 100,000 Cubans come intoMiami in less than five months in the 1980 Mariel Boatlift thatbegan a month before the race riots, this was another group comingto crowd them further down the city ladder.   Some compared the open-arms treatment for Nicaraguans to the factthat many black Haitian immigrants are turned away before they reachthe Florida coast or are later deported.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
