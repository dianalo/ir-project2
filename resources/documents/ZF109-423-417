header files? and so on.andP;  It theninstalled the system painlessly.andP;  Disk space are quite modest :- the MS-DOSsystem required less than 2 MB.andM;Memory Requirements After installing Glockenspiel onto my hard disk, myintention was to begin by compiling the classic 'hello' C++ program.andP;  Thismasterpiece is illustrated in its entirety in Figure 1.andM;Unfortunately , my initial attempts to compile this program resulted in thecompiler complaining about a lack of memory.andP;  Glockenspiel states that itscompiler needs to run on an 80286 or 80386 system with 640 KB of base memoryand a minimum of 1 MB of extended memory.andP;  Unfortunately, when I'm notrunning Windows, the extended memory on my machine is normally configured asa RAM cache and consequently it wasn't available to the compiler.andP;  Afterediting my CONFIG.SYS file and rebooting, all my extended memory was madeavailable to Glockenspiel and bello compiled and linked without furtherproblems.andP;  It's important to realise that the Glockenspiel compiler does needthat 1 MB of extended memory, preferably even more.andP;  It's sometimes all rightto take a software vendor's 'recommended' minimum hardware requirements witha pinch of salt.andP;  In this case, you shouldn't.andM;While on the subject of memory usage, it's interesting to note that thecompiler is implemented using the Rational Systems DOS/16M Extender, and it'sthrough this go-between that it makes use of extended memory.andP;  I've neverquite figured out why it is that a typical port of the ATandamp;T Cfront translatorseems to require even more memory than a native code C++ compilerimplementation, but Glockenspiel C++2.0 is no exception.andP;  Sadly, you can'tmake use of the Rational Extender technology from within your own software :-if you want to do that you have to buy the DOS Extender for yourself.andP;  Inthis respect, Borland's Turbo C++ VROOM system comes out on top because VROOMallows you to compile bigger programs (it's built into the compiler) and itcan be used inside your own software at no extra cost.andP;  Although the newZortech 2.1 C++ system also makes use of the same Rational Systems Extender,Zortech provide their own VCM Virtual Code Management) technology forinclusion in your own programs.andP;  The bottom line is: when it comes to writingbig MS-DOS based C++ programs, Borland and Zortech have done all the hardwork for you; with Glockenspiel it's an optional extra.andM;The compiler in use The Glockenspiel compiler is no speed demon.andP;  It chugsalong happily at the sort of speed that is all too familiar to Microsoft Cusers.andP;  Like Microsoft, it takes a large and sometimes bewildering range ofcompiler switches.andP;  For convenience, commonly used compilation switches canbe set up in an environment variable called CCXX.andP;  CCXX.EXE is also the nameof the compiler driver':- the small program which executes the various partsof the compiler proper, and then invokes the Microsoft C compiler and thelinker to produce the finished executable program.andM;Broadly speaking, the command line switches fall into one of threecategories: those beginning with a '!' character control the operation of theCCXX compiler driver program.andP;  These switches offer a useful range ofoptions, including the ability to generate a list of commands which can beredirected to a batch file.andP;  For machines without much memory, this batchfile can then be executed directly without the overhead of having thecompiler driver in memory also.andP;  The second category of switches is precededwith a  +' character.andP;  These switches control the operation of the C++compiler itself.andP;  An interesting option here is the ability to generate codecompatible with Microsoft C5.andP;  1.andP;  (By default, generated code is compatiblewith Microsoft C 6.0.) The final switch category starts with a character.andO;These switches control various aspects of the preprocessing and linkingphases.andP;  Unrecognised switches in this category are passed through to thenative code compiler.andP;  For example, you could specify '-Gsw' to instructMicrosoft C to generate Windows compatible code.andM;A very big surprise for me was the lack of support for anything except thelarge memory model.andP;  Maybe I'm missing something fundamental.andP;  I really can'tunderstand the need for this restriction.andP;  The Glockenspiel compiler is quitecapable of producing small and medium model code :- I tried a few experimentsto prove it.andP;  The problem is that only large model libraries are provided.andP;  Atotal of six different large model libraries are supplied covering thevarious combinations of calling convention (stack-based and register-based)and 8087 support (8087 mode, emulation and alternate).andP;  Given the choice, Isuspect that many potential customers users would prefer having fewer largemodel libraries and more of the other models! By contrast, both Zortech andBorland provide the usual range of memory models.andP;  The Glockenspiel compilerproduces C source code files with an extension of  .1'.andP;  These files are thenprocessed by the Microsoft C compiler, to produce object code.andP;  I wouldn'trecommend browsing through one of these C source files unless you have astrong stomach :- they're not intended for human consumption! This isn't areflection on the Glockenspiel implementation.andP;  Any version of Cfrontproduces similar output.andP;  The C code looks particularly tangled if youinclude and use the IOSTREAM.H header file, which contains the C++ interfacefor the new ATandamp;T stream library.andP;  This is because ATandamp;T seem to have atendency to use in line member functions with great enthusiasm.andP;  The code inthe IOSTREAM.HXX header contains i n 1 i ne functions which call inlinefunctions which call .... well, you get the idea.andP;  The example single Cstatement in Figure 2 should give you a flavour of what can happen.andM;Supplied UtilitiesandM;As a part of the Glockenspiel C++ package, Glockenspiel supply what lookslike a complete copy of the previously mentioned SyntaxManualas an onlinereference.andP;  The help file, called CXXSYN.HLP, is a help database file in thesame format as that used by both the Microsoft QuickHelp utility and the PWBhelp facility.andP;  just in case you don't have the QuickHelp program (ie you area C V5.1 owner), Glockenspiel has supplied a copy as part of the package.andM;Another interesting utility is a program called CXXFILT.andP;  This is a C++ nameunmangler' which restores mangled C++ names back to a human-readable form.andO;For those unfamiliar with the concept of C++ name mangling, it involvesencoding the number and types of a function's parameters into the functionname.andP;  All C++ 2.0 compilers implement 'type-safe linkage', whereby thelinker is able to check that all references to a function across all objectmodules agree with the actual function declaration.andP;  This is achieved by namemangling, which has the big benefit that a standard linker can be used.andP;  Thelinker will complain about unresolved referfinal object code has the effectof 'distancing'a C++ translator vendor from the end product:- the executableprogram.andP;  Ultimately, it will be much more difficult for a company likeGlockenspiel to provide such goodies as VROOM, VCM, and fully integrateddebugging support than it will be for the likes of Borland, Zortech and otherprospective manufacturers of native code compilers.andM;Until I've had a chance to check out the new Zortech release (which claimsWindows 3 compatibility) I believe that Glockenspiel is still a reasonablechoice for Windows and OS/2 development, although I do have some reservationsabout the lack of anything except large-model support.andP;  For regular MS-DOSwork, I don't feel that Glockenspiel is a serious competitor to Turbo C++.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
