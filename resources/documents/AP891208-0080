(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A three-story-high Santa Claus was felledby an arrow shot by vandals, and the inflatable St. Nick may facean even more formidable foe _ the city building inspector.   The giant Santa, complete with a lighted belly, acted as abeacon for a Christmas tree lot until it was punctured Wednesdaynight.   ``We were out there to wait on some people when we heard thisthump,'' said David Shepard, owner of the tree lot. ``We lookedaround and there were these guys screaming, `We hit the balloon!'''   The damage to the $7,000 balloon is minor, and Shepard saidThursday he expected Santa to be up and about in a day or so. Noone was arrested.   But just hours before the shooting, city building inspectorMatthias Mulvey said he might order the wind knocked out of thegiant Santa for violating height restrictions. He said the balloonis technically a sign and requires a special permit from the zoningboard.</TEXT></DOC>
