(DEC)and the 500,000-user Internet public computer network.andM;With Public Key, a user has a pair of keys.andP;  The first key remains private tothe user; the other can be distributed to other users for authenticatingsignatures and directing mail messages, officials said.andM;When a user ''signs'' a computer file, the software lifts a document''fingerprint'' -- a 128-bit unique identifier.andP;  This fingerprint isdigitally imprinted with the user's private key.andP;  After a file has beensigned and sent, any changes are automatically uncovered at the receiving endusing RSA Check, officials said.andM;The software was designed for use in security-conscious LAN environments andfor software vendors that want to check data integrity before shipping theirproducts.andP;  It was also designed for such Electronic Data Interchangeapplications as electronic purchase orders, said John Vermes, RSA's directorof marketing.andM;The RSA software is a natural fit for financial institutions, where onemisplaced zero can mean disaster, said one beta tester.andM;''Authentication is sometimes more important than privacy,'' said BernFlaherty, manager of corporate security for CitiCorp in New York, who isusing the software to authenticate departmental file transfers andbulletin-board software.andM;The U.S.andP;  Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington is using RSA Check and RSASign to validate network-software upgrades before distributing them across a3Com Corp.andP;  3+ network of more than 1,000 PCs.andM;While pleased with the software, Dick Heddinger, a Bureau computer scientist,noted that some applications, such as Lotus 1-2-3, require files to bestripped of their signature before they can be read.andM;RSA Check and RSA Sign are available now for PCs, and the firm is working onversions for the Macintosh and DEC VAX platforms, Vermes said.andM;A $295 introductory offer includes both packages, with the right to copy anddistribute 12 copies of RSA Check.andP;  Additional copies of RSA Check withrights for six copies costs $100.andP;  An RSA Check file-server license runs$100, and site-licensing is also available.andM;RSA Data Security Inc. can be reached at (415) 595-8782.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
