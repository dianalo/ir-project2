The center had been a target by radicals who oppose the presenceof 43,000 U.S. troops based in the country under a mutual defensetreaty.   A notice was posted on the front gate saying the center would beclosed temporarily while a new site is chosen, the U.S. embassysaid.   It was the first closure of a U.S. cultural center in 40 yearsand the embassy played down the event, saying it was temporary foran office move.   The closure precedes the anniversary May 18 of the bloody 1980Kwangju civil uprising in which 200 people were killed and 1,000injured.   Anti-American sentiment is strong in Kwangju; residents blameU.S. officials for doing nothing during the crackdown.   Elsewhere, farmers protesting imports of U.S. agriculturalproducts staged a sit-in outside the U.S. ambassador's residencetoday. Police said 26 were arrested.   The sit-in was brief and peaceful, witnesses said. Theresidence, on a narrow street near downtown, has been uninhabitedsince the last ambassador left in January. A new ambassador has yetto arrive.   ``U.S. trade pressure is endangering our life and South Korea'sagriculture industry,'' said leaflets distributed by the farmers.   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said U.S. officials triedto move the cultural center to an outlying center of Kwangju, 160miles from Seoul, but that residents of the area complained and anew site has not been found.   The center has been attacked repeatedly since 1980 by studentswielding firebombs and yelling anti-American slogans. The U.S.State Department said last January that the center would be movedif the attacks continued or if there was concern for safety of thestaff.   Dissidents and radical students welcomed the closure, claimingthe center should remain closed permanently. Newspapers in Seoulcalled the closure a measure to avoid possible trouble during theKwangju anniversary.</TEXT></DOC>
