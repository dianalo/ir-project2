(SystemsNetwork Architecture) (Special Report: Data and Voice TestEquipment)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Rasmussen, Jill L.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Here are three test schemes for networks that use IBM's SNA(Systems Network Architecture).andP;  A 'real' (operational) devicethat has been 'released' as a network node can be used for localtesting.andP;  It can be a host or an independent node such as a PC.andO;But the cost of dedicating a device to testing, especially a host,can be high.andP;  A testing bureau is an option.andP;  A bureau can get ahost to send permutations of data as test sequences.andP;  Tests arealready written, and remote testing costs less than buying orleasing a host.andP;  Protocol analyzers offer both interactive testingand automated testing and costs are a fraction of expenses for a'real' device.andP;  However, a protocol analyzer does not have all thecapabilities of a full-fledged network device: a complete andfinal test should involve a real device.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     SNANetwork ManagementNetwork Diagnostic/Test Equipment.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
