With radiation doses of 2-10 Gy no changes in thecollagen status were noted. An increased (from 5 to 25 Gy) radiationdose caused changes in physico-chemical properties which was indicativeof the formation, in the connective tissue collagen, of raiation-inducedintermolecular cross-links stabilizing the bopolymer structure.</TEXT></DOC>
