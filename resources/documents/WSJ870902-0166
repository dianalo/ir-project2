Berger</HL><DD> 09/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   From time to time somebody comes along and reminds us that, whatever else we may be between the angels and the subatomic infinities, we are at least also a species of mammal. It started with Charles Darwin. The most prominent reminder in recent decades has been Konrad Lorenz, Nobel Prize winner, impresario of geese and preacher of a vague reverence for nature. On this side of the Atlantic too, there has been a small but vocal band proclaiming our inevitable animality -- ethologists, sociobiologists, ecologists. Lionel Tiger has been one of the more interesting individuals in this camp. &quot;The Manufacture of Evil: Ethics, Evolution and the Industrial System&quot; (Harper andamp; Row, 448 pages, $20.50) extends the argument of his earlier works, notably &quot;Men in Groups&quot; (1969, revised in 1985) and &quot;The Imperial Animal&quot; (with Robin Fox, 1971).    Mr. Tiger is an anthropologist who has also had training as a sociologist. He is thus well positioned to understand both sides of the current version of the old &quot;nature/nurture&quot; debate. With all due respect for the social forces of nurture, he comes down firmly on the nature side of the argument. Not surprisingly, he has in consequence been the target of howls of outrage by those to whom any consideration of the biological determinants of human behavior constitutes prima facie evidence of racism, sexism, perhaps even Nazilike eugenic fantasies. The outrage, ever since Darwin, used to come mainly from the right; it still does, among creationists and other fundamentalists. In academically respectable circles, though, it is mainly the left that reacts with rage to every hint of Darwinian biologism; feminists are the most enraged (Mr. Tiger has still not persuaded them that he is really on their side, and the fact clearly upsets him).    In this book Mr. Tiger mostly goes over ground that he has covered before. There is now the added claim of doing ethics (somewhat immodestly described as an effort to provide a &quot;secular theodicy,&quot; a naturalistic account of the roots of evil).    The basic argument, stated with verve and occasional elegance, is quite clear. Man is a complex primate, physiologically still geared to be a hunter and gatherer, now forced to live in the artificial world made by modern technology. He is ill-prepared for this, not least in his ethics, which mostly date from pastoral and agrarian times. Ethical codes are ultimately grounded in man's genetic constitution; they are &quot;natural&quot; in this sense, symbolic representations of man's &quot;biogrammar.&quot; This does not mean that we cannot go against our nature in our belief and behavior. But there will be costs to such &quot;unnatural&quot; acts. The costs are mounting.    Mr. Tiger is at his best when he deals with specifics. In the chapter on &quot;The Body and the Body Economic&quot; he describes, at times brilliantly, &quot;the industrialization of the body&quot; undertaken by modern medicine and psychology. Anyone with experience of the technological processing of the contemporary hospital patient will readily agree with Mr. Tiger that something fiercely &quot;unnatural&quot; is going on here, and perhaps will even agree with the notion that the human costs of this may at times now outweigh the benefits.    The chapter entitled &quot;Queen Victoria's Revenge&quot; contains Mr. Tiger's critique of contemporary movements of alleged sexual liberation. The essence of &quot;Victorianism,&quot; closely related to the Industrial Revolution, was the denial of &quot;the rhyme and reason of the body.&quot; Feminism is a direct continuation of this. Thus it urges women to approach the world of work as if motherhood did not exist -- an inevitably futile agenda. Here Mr. Tiger draws on earlier work of his (&quot;Women in the Kibbutz,&quot; with Joseph Shepher, 1975), which showed that women will gravitate toward work that allows them close contact with their children. Similarly, against gay liberationists, Mr. Tiger contends that &quot;the issue of sexual preference cannot adequately be explained by a marketplace model of consumer preference.&quot; All of these denials, he warns, will not work in the long run.    Much of this is sensible and refreshing. In an age of technological hubris, when social engineers from all ideological camps (management technocrats, socialist planners, radical feminists and so many others, in unlikely alliance) try to mold human behavior, it is very salutary to be reminded that the animal nature of homo sapiens is not indefinitely flexible.    Beyond this welcome message, though, Mr. Tiger is disappointing. His conception of ethics is philosophically weak: Ethics may well have a base in nature, but it is not therefore &quot;natural&quot;; on the contrary, many of the great ethical revolutions have created norms that enjoin us not to do what &quot;comes natural.&quot; For example, there is sound zoological evidence to the effect that primates are intrinsically hierarchical animals; the most &quot;natural&quot; code of behavior of our species may well be the pecking order. If so, slavery, concubinage and the expulsion of the handicapped would be logical norms of a biogrammatically grounded ethics.    Also, there is a more plausible theoretical linkage between the biological and the socially constructed aspects of human life than the one Mr. Tiger draws upon. This is the linkage articulated in the European tradition of philosophical anthropology from Max Scheler to Arnold Gehlen, who stressed the &quot;unfinished,&quot; &quot;world-open&quot; character of the human organism -- and, therefore, its capacity, indeed necessity, for building freely imagined worlds. But, most important, Mr. Tiger gives us few concrete counsels for our institutional quandaries.    Let it be stipulated that there is a human biogrammar and that we should keep this in mind. The trouble is that, thus far, the data on this biogrammar are sparse and very much in dispute. Remembering our primate origins consequently provides little practical guidance. Personal decisions and public policy will have to be based on more proximate, empirically accessible insights. Do we really need all these biological theories to understand that we cannot ignore motherhood as we try to meet the needs of working women? Or to realize that &quot;sexual lifestyles&quot; cannot be chosen as we choose breakfast foods in the supermarket? Mr. Tiger thinks so. His position would be more persuasive if he could establish stronger links between his biological hypotheses and our practical problems.    ---   Mr. Berger is University Professor of Sociology at Boston University. </TEXT></DOC>
