The disclosures are contained in a Senate IntelligenceCommittee report that sheds new light on the Reaganadministration's secret intelligence alliances with Iraqidictator Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war. In the wakeof the Persian Gulf War, the tangled relationships with theIraqi regime during the 1980s are an awkward legacy forPresident Bush and Robert Gates, his nominee to head the CIA.</LP><TEXT>   William Casey, the late director of the CIA, emerges asthe driving force in the agency's early dealings with Iraq.But Mr. Gates was his deputy through much of 1986, andpreviously he supervised the agency's intelligence division.Similarly, Mr. Bush had his own ties to James Theberge, whowas recruited by Mr. Casey as a part-time CIA employee eventhough he was known to be a paid consultant to a subsidiaryof the Chilean arms and trading company Cardoen Industries.   Mr. Theberge had served under Mr. Reagan as U.S.ambassador to Santiago, where he cultivated ties to thePinochet regime. At the time of his death in 1988, he wasdescribed as an adviser to Mr. Bush on drug-traffickingissues. Cardoen Industries, headed by Carlos Cardoen, wasbelieved by the CIA to be a primary supplier of cluster bombsto the Iraqi government. In its report released Friday, theSenate committee found no evidence of secret U.S. informationbeing passed to Mr. Cordeon. But Mr. Theberge had access toextensive data as a member of a CIA review panel that helpsassess intelligence estimates.   The CIA's own intelligence-sharing with Saddam Husseinbegan with a 1984 directive signed by President Reagan. TheWhite House expanded this authority significantly in Apriland October 1986 after Iran launched a series of successfulground offensives. The intelligence enabled Iraq to counterwith long-range bombing attacks that had a devastating impacton Iran's oil industry. The Senate report suggests the CIAraced ahead of the National Security Council in providingsensitive information to Baghdad.   The committee report cites two occasions when CIA staffofficers shared intelligence that at the time &quot;may haveexceeded the sharing arrangement which had been authorized.&quot;Both incidents were in the summer of 1986. Though few detailsare provided, it was that August when Iraqi jets attackedIran's oil terminal on Sirri Island.   The CIA's relations with Iraq coincided with U.S. armssales to Iran that same year and the unauthorized diversionof profits to arm anti-Sandinista guerrillas in Nicaragua.The Senate committee this month recommended Mr. Gates'snomination favorably to the full Senate, but the reportreflects continued reservations about his answers regardingthe Iran-Contra as well as allegations that he tailoredintelligence analysis to suit the hardline, anti-Sovietbeliefs of his superiors.   For example, Mr. Gates has denied he suppressed dissent ashead of the CIA's intelligence division and testified that in16 cases from 1983 to 1986, alternative views were expressedby his directorate in footnotes to final intelligence papers.The committee report, however, lends support to his criticssince the panel found that none of those footnotes dealt withpolitical assessments of the Soviet Union. In all of thecases where footnotes were permitted on non-Soviet politicalmatters, they argued that the threat to U.S. interests wasgreater than estimated in the main texts.   In connection with Iran-Contra, the report includes newevidence of discussions in 1986 regarding efforts by theWhite House to have the CIA buy up planes and supplies ownedby a secret arms network used to support the Contras. In histestimony, Mr. Gates has said he has little memory of thesenegotiations. But the report lists a June 1986 meetingbetween himself and former NSC aide Marine Lt. Col. OliverNorth, who headed the network. A former CIA officer whoserved with Col. North at the NSC is quoted as &quot;absolutely&quot;recalling a telephone call from Mr. North to Mr. Gatesregarding the issue in the same period.</TEXT></DOC>
