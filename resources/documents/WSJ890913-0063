In a series of meetings, appropriations subcommittees overseeing the Justice Department, Pentagon, and Department of Housing and Urban Development approved significant increases for law enforcement and drug interdiction, but rejected offsetting cuts from domestic programs.    The White House signaled it would accept an across-the-board cut -- including the military -- to finance the president's share of the proposals. But the administration is clearly reluctant to go further for fear of a wholesale diversion of resources from the Pentagon. Defense Secretary Richard Cheney accompanied White House and budget officials at a meeting yesterday with Senate Republicans on the drug issue, and the administration stepped up its attacks on Democratic critics and warned it would veto a House-passed appropriations bill already cutting Mr. Bush's fiscal 1990 Pentagon budget.    Senate Democrats are scheduled to caucus this afternoon and, within the party, the issue has sparked divisions and old rivalries. Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd surprised the White House on Monday by proposing a $3.9 billion amendment almost doubling the increases sought by the president. But Mr. Byrd soon found himself at a disadvantage yesterday when a subcommittee within his own panel adopted a more modest $1.84 billion package. In both cases, the plans depend upon across-the-board cuts to finance new spending. But the second proposal confines itself to requests made by the administration within the Justice Department. The measure would be attached to an $17.3 billion bill funding not only the Justice Department but also the State and Commerce Departments. Its acceptance in the subcommittee was an implicit challenge to Mr. Byrd, and it prompted a testy and sometimes heated exchange with the subcommittee chairman, Sen. Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.).    Mr. Byrd had angered many Democrats earlier this year when he helped to undercut a House-passed amendment increasing funds for many of the same antidrug purposes. Mr. Hollings, who supported the House effort, still carries memories of that fight. &quot;I'm not going to roll over for him,&quot; the South Carolina conservative said later.    The division leaves an opening for the administration, but the debate underscores, too, that the Pentagon can't escape further cuts. In presenting its package last week, the administration identified potential savings of only $132 million from the military. But Mr. Hollings's proposal, which has bipartisan support in his subcommittee, demands reductions of an estimated $675 million. If the same method is used to finance the remainder of the president's proposals, the net reduction from the Pentagon could reach more than $800 million to $900 million.    These reductions are being discussed at a time when the military is also being tapped for a larger, direct role in the so-called drug war. The Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee yesterday earmarked more than $1 billion in fiscal 1990 spending for anti-drug activities. While some of these funds continue existing operations, the total represents a significant expansion beyond what the president anticipated.    Mr. Bush is assured of the $125 million requested to assist Andean countries, such as Colombia, in fighting drug traffic. But in addition, the subcommittee provided an estimated $512 million for drug interdiction efforts within the U.S. military itself. The National Guard would be promised $40 million in radar equipment for helicopters to assist local law-enforcement agencies and, separately, $300 million in transfers and operational support would go to the Coast Guard.    The net impact is to divert nearly $490 million more from the Pentagon than the administration requested, and this is before whatever across-the-board cut is finally negotiated. Although the White House still hopes to win approval of some of the individual domestic cuts it proposed, the administration has been hurt by its failure to present a more complete and credible financing package in its initial presentation.    For example, the Senate appropriations subcommittee overseeing the HUD budget yesterday brushed aside a White House proposal to find savings by trimming back House-passed increases in federal subsidies for public housing. Many of the nation's poorest tenants live in such housing. The panel yesterday approved $50 million in new spending for HUD for anti-drug activities, but the bill would, in fact, increase operating subsidies above the House level.    Similarly, Mr. Hollings and the ranking Republican on his subcommittee, Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.), have resisted cuts in Legal Services and the Economic Development Administration. And in the absence of any support for new taxes, appropriators continue to devise fees to offset spending. An estimated $30 million would be raised by having the Federal Bureau of Investigations charge for fingerprinting services in noncriminal matters, and one agency which is likely to have to pay heavily is the Pentagon.    Amid the increased funding for drugs, money isn't included in the Senate subcommittee bill for claims stemming from World War II. The House had approved $50 million to begin paying reparations to Japanese-Americans held in camps during the war, but senators said discretionary funds aren't available this coming year. </TEXT></DOC>
