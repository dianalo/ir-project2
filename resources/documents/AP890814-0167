But when it comes to rock 'n' roll itself, most peoplesay the tune's gone flat.   Eight in 10 American adults have heard of the Woodstockfestival, held Aug. 15-17, 1969, on a muddy farm in upstate NewYork _ and three in 10 of them wish they had attended, a MediaGeneral-Associated Press poll has found.

The analysis, one of the first studies of its kind, found thatdrug users had a 41 percent higher absence rate and about a 40percent higher rate of being fired, said researcher Jacques Normand.   Results suggest that by spending about $1.8 million a year toscreen job applicants for drugs, the post office could avoid about$3.1 million in costs related to absenteeism and firing in thefirst year, he said. Over three years, the avoided costs wouldsurpass $17 million, he said.   For private employers, the study provides hard data showing thatdrug screening results are related to later job performance, hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
