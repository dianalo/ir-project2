Process utilizing expanded bed reactorshave proven to be effective. Amoco has been operating an LC-Fining unitat conversions as high as 80%. It is an expanded bed resid hydrocrackingand hydrodesulfurization process. Recent advances have led to the developmentof the High Conversion LF-Fining Process, which is capable of conversionsof 95%. This article details the process and provides flowsheets, yields,product qualities, and costs for a commercial plant using the process.Results of pilot plant demonstrations are given. It has been shown thatremoval of very small amounts of coke precursors will result in significantimprovement in unit operation and product quality. 4 refs., 16 figs.,8 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
