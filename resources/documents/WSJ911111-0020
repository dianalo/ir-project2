Becton plummeted 13% in unusually heavy trading to$63.125, down $9.75, on the New York Stock Exchange. Bectonopened with an $8.875 drop to $64 after an order imbalance.Volume was 1.7 million shares, about 14 times the dailyaverage.</LP><TEXT>   The company's stock is now near its low for the year.Becton received a similar bruising in July, whenthird-quarter per-share results came in 10 to 15 cents shortof expectations. That dragged the stock price down to the low60s, off 21% from its high of $81.50 in April.   After the market closed Thursday, Becton reported flatquarterly earnings of $62.3 million, or $1.60 a share, abouta dime below estimates that had already been ratcheted downin early July. The company blamed a stronger dollar, a salesshortfall in Brazil and slower-than-normal growth in itsdiagnostic instruments sales in the U.S. Overall sales grew2.1% to $578.5 million from $566.5 million.   The results held earnings growth for the year to 4%, withnet income totaling $189.8 million, or $4.86 a share.Analysts had expected the company to weigh in at around $5 ashare. Sales grew 7.9% to $2.17 billion from $2.01 billion.   Becton also said results for the year ending Sept. 30,1992, will improve about 10%, excluding any unfavorablecurrency translations. Sales are expected to grow slightlymore quickly. However, first-quarter net is expected to beabout 50 cents a share, down from 75 cents a share in lastyear's quarter.   Jean Queally, an analyst at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. in Boston,said she has switched her long-term investment opinion of thecompany to neutral from a buy, saying she is more concernedabout the slowing diagnostic instruments sales in the U.S.than about Becton's problems in Brazil. Becton's Brazilianresults were hurt by a decision not to raise prices in thatcountry in a bid to increase market share. &quot;But now you'reback more to the company's basic businesses. That's where youhave the problem,&quot; Ms. Queally said.   &quot;I'd thought the stock would open {Friday} at the $65 to$67 range,&quot; she said.   The company's products include syringes, hypodermicneedles and diagnostic tests. Even without the drag of astronger dollar, its prediction of about $5.35 a share inearnings for next year is at the low end of the estimatesthat prevailed before the fourth-quarter results came out.&quot;Those numbers have to be out the window now,&quot; said a Bectonspokesman.   Ms. Queally says she has lowered her fiscal 1992 estimatesfor Becton's per-share earnings to a range of $5.25 to $5.35from $5.60 to $5.70.</TEXT></DOC>
