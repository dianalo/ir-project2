On Monday, Sens. Dan Quayle (R., Ind.) and Bill Bradley (D., N.J.) sent President Reagan a letter that jolted more than one State Department arms-control enthusiast. Co-signed by 52 other senators, the letter declared that any new arms accord with the Soviets &quot;would not be in our future security interests&quot; if it put onerous restrictions on cruise missiles.    The letter, frank though it is, hardly binds the administration, of course. And after their meeting this week, both foreign ministers Shultz and Shevardnadze repeated their desire -- by now an incantation -- to sign a new Start treaty by the next U.S.-Soviet summit in May. But along with other recent events the letter represents what hawks of various hues and shapes hope will be the beginning of a more sober assessment of arms-control possibilities in the final months of the Reagan presidency.    I say &quot;hope&quot; because arms control, like nothing else in Washington, seems to have a mad momentum all its own. Since Ronald Reagan made his remarkable transformation from arms-control critic to radical disarmer, the rush to agreement can be described only as breakneck. The INF treaty -- despite doubts from such establishment figures as Henry Kissinger -- has been moving through the Senate with little more than hosannas. More significant, the Start talks -- which could slash the U.S. nuclear deterrent by 50% -- have proceeded with barely a murmur of public scrutiny over their details, although the details will count for everything.    Just as remarkable is the way Congress and the press have become so much less skeptical of Mr. Reagan now that he's an ardent arms-controller. Back in his &quot;evil empire&quot; days, Mr. Reagan's hawkish decisions routinely leaked to critical reviews. Time magazine's Strobe Talbott devoted an entire book, which was widely celebrated, to recording the Reagan administration's every sin against the arms-control faith.    In Start, of course, the Reagan administration is still making fateful choices for U.S. security. But the skeptics just aren't around, or, when they are, they don't seem to get noticed. A hawk-manque such as Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) has been more than delighted to joust with the Reagan administration over executive-branch powers, but he hasn't said very much at all about a Start treaty that could control U.S. security decisions for years to come. Washington has many double standards, but the one that bows wide to anything that serves the &quot;arms-control process&quot; is among its most egregious.    In recent days, however, a few stirrings have begun to break the reverie. Former President Nixon, no enemy of arms treaties, has declared that Start as currently designed is &quot;not in the interest of the United States&quot; -- a view cited approvingly this week as well by Jeane Kirkpatrick, Mr. Reagan's former United Nations ambassador. Patrick Glynn, a former Reagan arms official who resigned last autumn in quiet disagreement with the administration, has also laid out a passionate, detailed case against Start in the most recent Commentary. He calls the Start process a &quot;scandal&quot; that won't do anything to enhance strategic stability; his piece drew enough blood to inspire a prompt reply from Reagan adviser Paul Nitze.    But there are also rumblings in the Senate. Sen. Quayle, for example, grew concerned when he heard the Soviets were demanding that the U.S. agree to cruise-missile limits. Cruise missiles, of course, may be the best thing to happen to European defense since, well, nuclear weapons. Because of their accuracy, cruises should reduce the risk of nuclear escalation because they also can carry powerful conventional warheads. Yet Sen. Quayle was well aware that, during the final stages of the INF talks, the administration had agreed to a Soviet request to ban all ground-launched cruises in order to settle a dispute over verification. Sen. Quayle doesn't want the same thing to happen to air- or sea-launched cruises. So he typed up the letter, discussed and refined it with Sen. Bradley, and the two personally encouraged their colleagues to sign it.    At the same time, another jolt came from the Senate Intelligence Committee. Chairman David Boren of Oklahoma, who is rare among Senate Democrats for thinking seriously about defense, announced that the U.S. probably doesn't now have the satellite capability even to verify a Start treaty. Yet under a Start regime, the committee report said, &quot;The Soviet incentive to cheat could increase because of a greater difficulty in meeting targeting requirements&quot; in Europe and the U.S. Mr. Boren urged a big new investment to improve U.S. intelligence collection.    The concern about the pace of Start extends even to many who are strong supporters of INF. &quot;INF is small potatoes, but Start is a matter of national survival,&quot; says one official who's been trying to shepherd INF safely through the Senate. &quot;I've talked to Democrats who support INF and they think Start is moving far too fast.&quot; He says some are concerned enough to delay INF if they don't like what they see happening in the Start talks. &quot;And I don't think George Shultz and Paul Nitze understand this,&quot; he says.    Like many hawks around town -- including many who used to work for the administration -- he thinks the best thing President Reagan could do now for U.S. security is to announce at the Moscow summit that he's leaving the most important decisions to the next president. That would run face into the pell-mell logic of the arms-control process, of course, but it also would be a finer legacy for President Reagan than any final, hurried agreement. </TEXT></DOC>
