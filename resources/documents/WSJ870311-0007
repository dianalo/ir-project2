The banks were part of a group of 31 government bond dealers that agreed last April to buy Liberty Brokerage Inc. Liberty was founded in 1985 by a group of dealers led by Salomon Brothers Inc. and Citibank to try to reduce fees charged by government bond brokers.    Government bond dealers use brokers as intermediaries to conceal their moves from other dealers. The Justice Department is investigating government bond brokers, including Liberty, for possible restraint of trade. Brokers limit access to pricing information to so-called primary dealers and firms that aspire to be primary dealers. Liberty's 31 co-owners are all primary dealers.    Primary dealer status is granted by the Fed, which won't do business with anyone else.    The Fed said in its order approving the banks' applications that the Justice Department informed it that no antitrust problems existed from a structural point of view either in Liberty's formation or its acquisition.    The banking groups affected by the order are BankAmerica Corp., Bankers Trust New York Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp., Chemical New York Corp., Citicorp, Continental Illinois Corp., First Chicago Corp., First Interstate Bancorp., Hongkong andamp; Shanghai Banking Corp.; together with Kellett N.V., HSBC Holdings B.V. and Marine Midland Banks Inc., Manufacturers Hanover Corp., Midland Bank PLC, J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., and Westpac Banking Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
