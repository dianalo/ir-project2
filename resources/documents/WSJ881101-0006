(AP)  </DATELINE><TEXT>   John Morrell andamp; Co. sought a federal court injunction to block a record $4.3 million fine levied against the meatpacker Friday by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.    Morrell, a unit of United Brands Co., Cincinnati, wants to stop the OSHA action because the company believes it was unfairly singled out, Morrell Chairman Milton J. Schloss said.    &quot;If OSHA continues to single out Morrell and create a completely uneven playing field against our competition, OSHA could very well shut that plant down,&quot; he said. OSHA contends the company knew about serious health hazards at its Sioux Falls plant but failed to protect its 2,000 workers there.    Morrell's action seeks an injunction against OSHA and the U.S. Department of Labor. It contends there are no industry standards on how to prevent the &quot;repetitive-motion&quot; injuries cited by OSHA and says Morrell's repeated requests for such standards have been ignored.    The injuries cited by OSHA occur as a result of repeated hand, wrist and arm motion during work.    The fine imposed Friday was the largest against an employer in OSHA's 17-year history. </TEXT></DOC>
