WilliamProxmire, D-Wis., and Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet L. Norwoodhave met the first Friday of every month in the Dirksen SenateOffice Building for an economic tea dance. Much as he tried to setthe beat, she'd only waltz.   They had their last session Friday, with the 73-year-old senatorholding his final hearing of the Joint Economic Committee ofCongress before retiring next month.   As usual, Proxmire asked leading questions, attempting to get thechief keeper of the nation's economic statistics to pooh-pooh therosy spin the administration puts on the employment figures eachmonth.   With equal aplomb, Mrs. Norwood, a holdover appointee of formerPresident Jimmy Carter reappointed twice by President Reagan,carefully phrased her answers to avoid any direct or impliedcriticism of economic policymaking by the Presdent, the Congress orthe Federal Reserve Board.   Addressing Mrs. Norwood for the last time as a member of thecommittee in her 101st appearance before it, Proxmire said heexpected her usual ``public, truthful and unvarnished explanation''of the November numbers.   However, that did not prevent him from trying one last time toget her critize the administration's latest and last economicforecast of 3.5 percent growth, 3.7 percent inflation and a 5.2percent unemployment rate for next year.   ``I want to see if you can evade this question?'' he said,referring in good humor to their past duels.   Mrs. Norwood responded that with the labor force growing lessslowly, it will be easier for the nation to maintain lowerunemployment rates than in the past and that there really isn't muchevidence of any wage inflation.   But she acknowledged that ``it will be very, very, very difficultto achieve both'' a 5 percent unemployment rates and an inflationrate declining to 1.5 percent by 1994 as the administrationforecasts.   Proxmire began holding the hearings 17 years ago in response toan order by President Nixon to the labor statistics commssioner atthe time, Geoffrey Moore, to quit giving the press briefings on thenumbers.   If the labor statistics commissioner could not hold a pressconference to offer a ``truthful and unvarnished explanation'' ofthe numbers, as Proxmire said at the time, then Congress wouldcompel it in the form of a hearing.   While the only people in attendance normally are limited toProxmire, Mrs. Norwood, a few members of each's staff and a handfulof reporters, no force _ including the weather _ has been able toget in their way since.   Both usually hang around briefly upon the conclusion of thehearings to answer questions from reporters on the numbers.   A year ago, when the rest of the government was shut down by asevere blizzard on an unemployment-report Friday, Proxmire joggedthrough the snow to make the hearings and Mrs. Norwood spent thepreceding night in a hotel near the Capitol to make sure the weatherwould not interfere with her attenndance.   Other economists in the Bureau of Labor Statistic left theirhomes at 4:30 a.m., some of them walking miles from the Virginiasuburbs to their offices, to make sure that experts who compiled thereport would be available to answer questions upon its release at8:30 a.m.   Both Proxmire and BLS officials said Friday they expect thattradition to continue.   ``This is very important to her,'' said Henry Lowenstern, anassistant labor statistics commissioner. ``She really believes inthe need for a public forum.''   Proxmire said he is sure that Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., now thecommittee's chairman, will maintain the practice of the monthlyhearings.   ``I think we have them pretty well established now,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
