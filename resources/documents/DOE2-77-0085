The methodologies that facilitate the technology transferroute are exchanges and agreements with gas utilities that have devolopedsuccessful new technology, selecting sites within the territory servedby Gaz Metropolitain for demonstration projects, providing financialand technical support for demonstration projects, publishing resultsand introducing new products, joint commercial ventures with manufacturers,and taking part in related conferences and trade fairs.

The author emphasizesthe importance of new gas technologies being produced in Canada or theUnited States, the infrastructure of sales and service support beingpresent for successful technology transfer, and the pairing of Randamp;D withinthe company.</TEXT></DOC>
