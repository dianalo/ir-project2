The cause of thecrunch is the same: The economy went down and governmentspending kept going up.   Big-city mayors sometimes make national headlines withtheir tax increases. David Dinkins of New York must nowendure the image of providing less-service-for-more-money,though it was under his neoconservative predecessor Ed Kochthat the city payroll grew by a quarter while the populationheld steady. Philadelphia is in worse shape. Detroit suffersand endures. Some mayors must be hoping that sinceCleveland's default in 1978, we've gone to a Too Big to Failrule in municipal finance. Don't count on it.</LP><TEXT>   Less visible than the cities but directly affecting moreAmericans are the counties. In California, tiny Butte Countyhas nearly gone under two years running. Nearly 500 milessouth is Los Angeles County, easily the largest in the U.S.with about nine million residents. With a judge havingrecently engineered the shift from conservative to liberalmajority on the Board of Supervisors, the powers-that-now-bepromise to undo pioneer work there in privatization ofservices. As it was, L.A. County spending tripled during the'80s with population up less than 20%. County taxpayers therealready have a deficit-ridden state Legislature ready tolunge at their wallets.   Census Bureau data for all cities and counties in the U.S.show that between 1982 and 1989, the biggest drains were thecourts and jails, up a combined 157%. Long-term debt costsrose 122%. (What's all this about scrimping on publicinfrastructure?) The other major categories less thandoubled, though it's worth noting that transit subsidiesoutpaced health and welfare. Remember the starving libraries?Up 81%.   As dismal as the local fiscal picture may be, the onset of&quot;contracting-out&quot; and other means of privatization over thepast two decades is a ray of hope. It has occurred alongsidethe wide-scale unionization of the public sector thatfollowed liberalized collective-bargaining statutes of the1960s.   According to the 1989 Municipal Yearbook, the growth ofcontracting-out -- the selection of an exclusive, privateoperator to substitute for the local government in certaincapacities -- moderated from 1982-88 after an earlier surge.But the use of vouchers, with recipients choosing their ownservice-providers, began to take off during the same period.This concept is still in its infancy, however -- primarily intransit, day care, homeless shelters -- and fewer than 10% oflocalities are on board.   The shift of public services to the marketplace actuallyrepresents a gradual return to an earlier American era. WhenWashington undertook the funding of road building in theearly 1900s, a recent study for the National Academy ofPublic Administration noted, &quot;it did so not through thecreation of a federal road construction bureau, but throughgrants to states to help finance contracts with privatecontractors.&quot; Only with the New Deal did governments take toperforming a wide variety of functions themselves.   The record in sanitation, or garbage collection, isillustrative of the recent trend. Municipal employment in thefield declined by half between 1975 and 1983, partly becauseof more mechanized operations but also as a result ofprivatization. This followed a decade (1965-75) in which 56%of the nation's sanitation unions were formed. However,survey results in the January/February 1991 issue of PublicAdministration Review show that unionized cities actually areless likely to try contracting-out, probably because theunions are able to block it. Apparently privatization provessatisfactory. Only 5% of the surveyed cities that tried itreported going back to public garbage collection.   The importance of restraining growth of the public workforce is not just in higher day-to-day efficiency, but in thelong-term obligations of expensive public-pension programs.These are typically handled at the state level, but includelocal government and school employees. An interesting storyis to be found in the 1990 Comparative Study of Major PublicEmployee Retirement Systems by the state of Wisconsin.   More than half of the 85 pension plans studied includelocal employees other than teachers. The numbers show thatbetween 1986 and 1990, these plans were trending towardearlier-retirement eligibility, quicker vesting, nocontributions from the employee, automatic COLAs, andbenefits based on the last two or three years' salary averagerather than a longer time frame. In all, more costly for thetaxpayers on every front. (Because of a 1989 court ruling,many recipients do face greater tax liabilities, so thisisn't a pure worker windfall.)   For local governments, as for the states to which they areso tightly linked, the days of surpluses are over. The crunchis here, reinforced by citizens who are pinched in their ownpersonal-income vises. The message is clear: Do more withless. The way to do it is just as manifest.</TEXT></DOC>
