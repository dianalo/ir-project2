Called the ``smart cart'' by county engineers, the boxy,self-propelled metal delivery machine is expected to head offmealtime violence by taking food to prisoners in the 15 buildingsinstead of the prisoners going to the food.   ``The jail layout is such that the sheriff wants to deliver thefood instead of taking inmates to a central dining area,'' saidRuel Brown, assistant planner of the new facility.   The board of supervisors of the county east of San Francisco hasapproved a $4.8 million contract for 18 robots made by ApogeeRobotics Inc. of Fort Collins, Colo., a company that alreadymanufactures similar machines for several defense corporations.   The robots, formally known as the automatic-guided vehiclesystem, stand 17 inches high, two feet wide and six feet long. Eachcarries about 30 food trays.   At the new jail in Santa Rita, the $250,000 machine, which lookslike a squat filing cabinet, will be dispatched from a central areaand, guided by two miles of wire embedded in the jail's floor, willdeliver meals to the separate 96-cell housing facilities. They areequipped with sensors which see 12 feet ahead, watching forobstacles.   Alameda is the first jail system in the nation to install therobots, said Jim Jones, president of the manufacturer. The companyhas produced similar robots used by IBM, Rockwell International andWestinghouse Electric Corp. to deliver supplies, he said.   ``It had to be designed so that (prisoners) can't hidecontraband in it,'' Jones said. ``We won't have a problem with it,unless the staff doesn't do regular preventative maintenancechecks.''   Sheriff's representatives say they are sure the machines willimprove security. There will be no long walks to the kitchen orrowdy mealtime crowds, thanks to the 1,500-pound, stainless-steelrobot.   The Alameda County Sheriff's Department plans to find out howtough the machines really are with a test patterned after atelevision luggage commercial.   A retired sheriff's captain _ armed with confiscated``implements of destruction,'' including an axe handle and ice pick_ will attempt to rough up one of the robots, said Ruel Brownassistant project planner for the jail.   ``I'm not sure what he weighs, but he's a big man,'' Brown said.</TEXT></DOC>
