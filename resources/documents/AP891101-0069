Trucks carrying flour and gasoline entered Kabul for the firsttime in 11 days, a day after Soviet-backed troops cleared blockadesby U.S.-backed guerrilla forces.   Soldiers with knowledge of the Salang Highway said two weeks'worth of steady traffic was backed up on the road and waiting tocome to the capital.   Most of the trucks today were privately owned vehicles. Thegovermnment recently has ended its monopoly on the transportationand sale of fuel and sugar because of shortages. Now it is relyingon private truckers to feed its people and supply them with fuelfor the winter.   The rocket attacks came after the government had said it wasintensifying efforts to clear guerrillas from the mountainssurrounding Kabul.   On Tuesday, reporters were shown a captured guerrilla hideout 15miles south of the city. Tuesday night, government troops fireddozens of rockets at the Paghman Mountains to the west, anotherguerrilla stronghold.   Since June, rocket attacks on the city have killed about 400people and wounded 900. The government blamed the guerrillas, whodeny rocketing civilian targets and say the government is killingits own people.   At the United Nations, the General Assembly was expected toapprove an unprecedented resolution today calling on Afghanistan'sCommunist government and the guerrillas to open negotiations onforming a coalition government.   The U.N. resolution called for a government of nationalreconciliation that is non-aligned and Islamic. Passage of theresolution in the General Assembly is a formality, since the Sovietand Pakistani delegations worked out mutually acceptable languageweeks ago.   The General Assembly had never before ordered the combatants inthe 10-year-old civil war to open peace talks, nor has it specifiedthe ideological or religious orientation of the resultinggovernment of national reconciliation.   Under a U.N.-mediated plan, Moscow completed the withdrawal ofmore than 100,000 Red Army troops on Feb. 15, more than nine yearsafter the first Soviet forces rolled into the country to back theMarxist government.   The rebels control most of the countryside but have made littlemilitary or diplomatic progress since the Soviet withdrawal ended.</TEXT></DOC>
