A federal grand jury here has accused the Dallas company, William G. Moore Jr., its chairman and chief executive officer, and Robert Reedy, head of its marketing operation, of trying to manipulate for personal gain the agency's purchase of sophisticated mail-sorting equipment.    Peter Voss, a former vice chairman of the Postal Service, pleaded guilty last year to participating in the scheme, was fined $11,000 and is serving a four-year prison term. The indictment charges that the conspirators resorted to bid-rigging, payment of gratuities and embezzlement to obtain the inside track for Postal Service contracts in 1985 and 1986.    Postal Service officials said the contractor's temporary suspension is intended to protect the agency during legal proceedings and doesn't imply a conclusion about the charges. If convicted, however, Recognition Equipment could be fined more than $3 million and be barred from winning future government contracts.    The Postal Service officials also said they don't expect Recognition Equipment's suspension to affect an ambitious five-year capital spending plan, announced last week, that earmarks $4.2 billion for automation. An official of the agency explained that several other companies are capable of producing the same kind of postal machines produced by Recognition Equipment. </TEXT></DOC>
