In fiscal 1986, Honda reported net income of $811.4 million on revenue of $16.12 billion. Tetsuo Chino, senior managing director of Honda and president of its U.S. sales arm, American Honda Motor Co., made the forecast at a news conference in Columbus, Ohio, announcing the previously reported expansion of operations at Honda's engine plant in Anna, Ohio.    As the Japanese currency has risen against the U.S. dollar, the amount of yen produced by a transaction denominated in dollars has fallen. While Honda has raised prices to make up for some of the profit lost in the currency exchange, Mr. Chino said, the increases haven't been enough to entirely offset the strong yen's impact. </TEXT></DOC>
