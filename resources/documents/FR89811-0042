If the determination is made thatan EIS is not required, the proposed action will begin without furthernotice. Comments presenting new information concerning this FONSI shouldbe sent to the address given at the end of this notice.The proposed action is a $248 million modification, addition, and new constructionprogram to support the Pacific Fleet introduction of the new TRIDENT D-5missile. This action was previously discussed in a 1974 EIS and Supplementsand described in the preliminary Base Master Plan referenced in the EIS.This action also includes new requirements which have arisen since theEIS and Supplements were published. The proposed action will constructnine new buildings, add to or modify ten existing buildings, construct54 new magazines, modify 32 magazines, build a second explosive handlingwharf, and provide utilities and site improvements for facilities upgrade.The new buildings consist of: an Engineering Services Building, a RadiographicInspection Building, a Motor Inspection Building, a Missile Assembly Building,a Transfer Facility, a Support Equipment Storage Building, a Launcher StorageBuilding, a Ballast Can Facility, and a Dockside Handling Building. Theproposed construction program would commence in 1989 and be completed in1997.The current SUBASE Bangor was designed and built to support TRIDENT submarinescarrying C-4 missiles. Early planning for the SUBASE included explosivesafety arcs and siting considerations for production of the larger D-5missile, although, at the time SUBASE Bangor was built, the D-5 missilewas still many years in the future. The missile is now going through itsfinal testing and is scheduled to deploy in the Atlantic early in 1990.In the Pacific, however, construction of new facilities and upgrading ofpresent facilities will be required before the D-5 missile can be deployedfrom Bangor.Alternatives to the proposed action considered in the EA include no actionand the construction of only those facilities identified in the 1974 EISand Supplements and supporting documentation.The no action alternative would not allow the deployment of D-5 from SUBASEBangor, since new and altered facilities are required to receive, assemble,transport, store, load, and conduct training associated with the TRIDENTD-5 Weapons System. This alternative would not allow Pacific TRIDENT submarinesto receive the missiles that would enable them to operate at full designcapability. It would leave a multi-billion dollar strategic deterrent systemwithout the means to utilize the new, technically advanced missile forwhich the system was designed from its inception. This is essential sincethe D-5 missile is expected to remain operational well into the twenty-firstcentury, while the current C-4 missile has a remaining life expectancyof just over ten years. This alternative would prevent the Navy from havingfacilities ready to assemble and deliver the D-5 missiles to submarinesprior to the C-4 missile's expected retirement.The second alternative, allows construction of only those facilities previouslydiscussed in the 1974 EIS, Supplements and supporting documents. Whilethe EIS and Supplements planned for future deployment of the D-5 missile,not all shore facility requirements were known at the time of documentpreparation. This alternative falls short of D-5 Upgrade requirements inmany critical areas, including missile transport, training, and launchersupport. Without the projects as specified in the EA proposed action, SUBASEBangor could not support deployment of the D-5 Weapons System. Similarto the no action alternative, this alternative would leave the Navy withoutthe D-5 capability in the Pacific. The proposed action was determined tobe the only practicable way of providing required support facilities.Impacts associated with the proposed action were not considered significant.Site preparations and construction will be designed to minimize erosionand to avoid unnecessary disturbance of adjacent areas. Erosion controlmeasures will be used during construction to further reduce soil erosion.Storm water discharge resulting from the proposed construction on areaswith existing facilities will be serviced by existing storm water controls(storm water detention and oil-water separation systems) with no adverseimpact to the environment. A new permanent storm water detention/sedimentationpond will be constructed to control storm water discharges from facilitiesconstructed in the Devil's Hole watershed. About 0.3 acre of the proposedsite for this detention pond is a wetland created by water retention atthe intersection of two roads. Construction of the pond is authorized undera U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) Nationwide Wetland Fill Permit. Asrequired, the Navy will notify COE prior to construction. As mitigationfor this disturbance, wetland vegetation will be planted on the banks ofthe pond. Thus no net loss of wetland vegetation will occur and an overallincrease in habitat quality will result.Air emissions resulting from construction and operation of the proposedfacilities will be in compliance with Puget Sound Air Pollution ControlAgency guidelines and regulations.Ground water resources are not expected to be affected by any of the D-5projects. Erosion and sediment control measures mentioned earlier willbe included in construction contracts to avoid the potential for erosionand sediment suspension.No disturbance to any existing hazardous waste sites on SUBASE Bangor willoccur, nor will remedial measures planned for any identified waste sitesbe impacted as a result of the proposed action.The proposed action will clear about 57 acres of forestlands (about 1.5%of total managed forest resources on SUBASE) dominated by Douglas fir.Timber to be cut ranges in diameter from four to twelve inches. No ``oldgrowth'' timber stands will be impacted by the proposed action. In mitigation,about 57 acres of previously cleared land will be seeded and planted inherbaceous/shrub species, which will increase plant species diversity andprovide wildlife habitat. Federally protected endangered species will notbe impacted as a result of the proposed action.Construction of the proposed explosive handling wharf will require no dredging.Pile driving activity will cause a minor and short-term suspension of sedimentsin the immediate area of work. Environmental monitoring conducted continuouslysince 1973 indicates no adverse impacts have resulted from constructionor operations of EHW-1. The proposed new wharf will provide additionalintertidal and subtidal invertebrate and fisheries habitat. In coordinationwith the State of Washington, the site for the new wharf will be harvestedof geoducks prior to construction and allowed to seed in naturally afterconstruction. In-water construction moratoria during fish migration periodswill be incorporated into project design and contract documents. Necessarypermits for in-water construction will be secured from the COE. Applicablestandards developed by the Washington State Departments of Fisheries andWildlife, U.S. Fisheries and Wildlife Service, and National Marine FisheriesService for marine resource protection will be incorporated into designand contract documentation, and facility operation.The proposed action will not impact archaeological, cultural, or historicresources listed or determined eligible for listing on the National Registerof Historic Places.The number of construction workers at SUBASE Bangor will increase by about200 during the nine years of planned construction; however, it is anticipatedthese workers will be recruited from the local area. About 50% of the moneyspent on construction will remain in the local economy, producing positiveeconomic benefits. About 364 technical support staff personnel will relocateto the Bangor area as a result of the proposed action. This populationincrease will be small by comparison to normal county growth projections.Since real SUBASE population growth falls well within projected countygrowth and since new personnel are expected to settle at diverse locations,impacts on housing and schools will be minor. The small increase in trafficwill produce only minor impacts to air quality and noise levels.Since all utility services currently provided to SUBASE are capable ofhandling the increased loads to be caused by D-5, only minor impacts, ifany, are expected.Based on the information gathered during the preparation of the EA, theNavy finds that the TRIDENT D-5 Upgrade Program at SUBASE Bangor will nothave a significant impact on the quality of the human environment.The EA prepared by the Navy addressing this action may be reviewed at theoffices of: Commanding Officer, Strategic Weapons Facility, Pacific, Silverdale,WA 98315-5500 (ATTN: Mr. Glenn Starr, andplusmin;396-4968).The EA has also been placed in the following Kitsap County Regional Libraries:<ITAG tagnum="15">Central Library, 1301 Sylvan Way, Bremerton, WA 98310</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Bainbridge Island Branch, 1270 Madison North, Bainbridge Island, WA98110</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Subase Bangor Branch, Building 2500, Silverdale, WA 98383</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Downtown Bremerton Branch, 612 5th Avenue, Bremerton, WA 98310</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Kingston Branch, Kingston Community Center, Kingston, WA 98346</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Little Boston Branch, Little Boston Road NE, Little Boston, WA 98346</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Manchester Branch, Main Street, Manchester, WA 98353</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Port Orchard Branch, 87 Sidney, Port Orchard, WA 98366</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Silverdale Branch, 3450 NW Carlton Street, Silverdale, WA 98383</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Poulsbo Branch, 700 NE Lincoln, Poulsbo, WA 98370</ITAG>The EA is on file and may be reviewed by interested parties at the placeof origin, Strategic Systems Programs, Department of the Navy, Washington,DC 20376 (Attn: Mr. Darryl Devnich, Code SP 20162, telephone (202) 697-8054).A limited number of copies of the EA are available to fill single copyrequests.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 8, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">J.
