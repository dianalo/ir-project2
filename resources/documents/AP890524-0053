The rioters Tuesday night also threw up a makeshift barricadeacross a street, looted at least one store and set a local counciloffice on fire, said Deputy Chief Constable Paul Leopold of theWest Midlands police.   In 1985, predominantly black and racially mixed areas of Britishtowns and cities including Wolverhampton were swept by a wave ofprotests of police harassment. In the worst incident, a policemanwas hacked to death in the Tottenham district of north London.   Social workers said the underlying cause of those riots includedhigh unemployment among young people, especially young blacks, andpoor housing in inner-city areas.   Leopold told a news conference that the trouble began in Tuesdaynight when police raiding the pub made 20 arrests, 12 for drugoffenses, and seized marijuana and crack cocaine.   He said 250 officers _ members of the police drug squad and apolice support unit _ were attacked by the mob.   The officers dispersed the mob in about two hours, he said.   ``The conduct of these youths reacting to legitimate policeaction in making a serious drugs raid is totally reprehensible andinexcusable,'' Leopold said.   In February 1987, 13 people were arrested, shops were looted andwindows smashed in rioting in the area following the death of alocal black man.   The black man had collapsed after a struggle with two policemenwho were called to a shop when a clerk became suspicious that thecredit card the man was carrying might have been stolen.   An inquest returned a verdict of accidental death.   Last year, parcel bombs were mailed to two senior policeofficers and to a former police official. Police said the bombswere believed to be the work of a group calling itself the BlackLiberation Front.</TEXT></DOC>
