WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some state and local Democratic leaders saythat while Michael Dukakis' Republican rivals have made their grabfor the national spotlight, his campaign has been making importantorganizational gains in the field.   Around the country, Dukakis field leaders and Democratic Partystate and local leaders contend the appearance of flagging momentumon the part of the Dukakis campaign is at worst a temporary problem_ a part of the ups and downs of a campaign that will balance inthe end.   Dukakis campaign officials have said they were devoting much oftheir summer efforts to building organization in the states, andparty officials in some key states point to organizational gains.   ``Now is the time for quiet organizational activity that doesn'tget much publicity but pays off at the end,'' said Lanny J. Davis,Democratic national committeeman from Maryland. ``Dukakis has puttogether perhaps the best field organization ever put together by apresidential candidate. None of that gets headlines, but you'll seeevidence of it in the fall.''   In Ohio, a critical industrial state, party spokeswoman CarolRowan said the party has hired 15 field coordinators to work withthe Dukakis campaign. ``We are getting everything into place in thegrass roots, and that's where this election will be won,'' she said.   Iowa state House Speaker Don Avenson said a Dukakis organizationhas been built in regional areas of the state far earlier than inprevious Democratic campaigns. Party chairman Bonnie Campbell saidthere are 12 Dukakis field workers and six administrators in thisimportant Midwestern farm state that has gone Republican in recentyears.   ``We're seeing organizational work developing very, very earlyin a campaign,'' Avenson said. ``Compared to recent years, it'sunprecedented.''   In Minnesota, a good state for Dukakis, the campaign has opened15 state offices, compared with one for Republican George Bush,according to Dukakis campaign director Pat Forciea.   But in South Carolina, a difficult state for Dukakis, statecampaign director Det Bowers said, ``We're operating almost totallyon volunteers.''   In New York, Erie County Democratic chairman Joseph Crangleacknowledged some ``sluggishness'' in the Dukakis campaign inrecent weeks and said the problem has been discussed at localorganizational meetings. He said some Dukakis supporters may havebecome overconfident in view of Dukakis's lead in the polls afterthe Democratic convention.   That lead vanished in the glare of attention on Bush and the GOPconvention in New Orleans. The focus on the Republican ticket wasprolonged after the convention because of the controversialselection of Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana as vice presidentialnominee.   In Missouri, a battleground state for the fall campaign, partyexecutive director Todd Patterson said ``the Quayle mess'' haddrawn publicity to the Republican ticket _ and that it had hurtDukakis, even though much of the attention was critical.   ``Right now, they've cut Dukakis off at the knees in terms ofpublicity,'' Patterson said. ``I believe in my heart that Dukakiswill eventually win Missouri, but I think we have to get back ontrack.''   Dukakis himself voiced frustration on Monday that he has beenunable to draw attention to his economic themes because of theattention on Quayle and on Bush's attacks on him.   ``The Dukakis campaign has lost some of its early momentum,''said Richard Lodge, chairman of the Democratic Executive Committeein Tennessee. ``I think George Bush has controlled the debate, buthe has done it through the traditional Republican trick ofdistorting Governor Dukakis's record.''   Dukakis sought to take the offensive Tuesday, aggressivelyattacking Bush on crime, defense spending and his role in theIran-Contra affair.   ``I don't think Democrats have been pushing forward asaggressively and quickly as the Republicans,'' said Patterson, theMissouri Democrat. ``The Republicans have been forced to movequickly because they've had to stir the dust up so voters won't seewhere they're at in the road.''   Some state Democrats dismissed talk of the campaign stalling, orsaid it's so early it doesn't matter.   ``The campaign is won in the last two weeks, not the first twoweeks,'' Alabama party chairman John Baker said.</TEXT></DOC>
