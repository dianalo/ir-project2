Charles Bowsher, comptroller general of the GAO, theinvestigative arm of Congress, conjured up visions of acrisis similar to the savings-and-loan debacle in testimonybefore the Senate Banking Committee. He exhorted Congress toavert a need for federal assistance by giving bankingregulators the authority to raise insurance premiums in theBank Insurance Fund higher than is currently planned.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We could lose this fund, just like we lost the {savingsand loan} fund,&quot; he warned the committee, adding: &quot;We have alot of situations out there that could wipe the fund out.&quot;   The committee appeared eager to embrace any proposal thatwould keep them from having to vote for a potential taxpayerbailout down the road. &quot;If action is necessary, let's take itnow,&quot; said Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of thecommittee. No one opposed Mr. Bowsher's plan to pile anotherbank insurance premium increase atop one scheduled to takeeffect next year in order to stabilize the fund.   Bankers generally have agreed that next year's scheduledincrease in assessments to 19.5 cents per $100 of depositsfrom 12 cents per $100, is necessary, but that any increasebeyond that would be crippling.   Many analysts don't believe that the banking industry isin as severe financial straits as was the thrift industrywhen a bailout law was passed last year. The industry as awhole has a stronger capital position, which acts as acushion for the deposit insurance fund. Nonetheless, Mr.Bowsher and the committee found disturbing similarities inhow the industry is increasing its exposure to risk at a timethat its taxpayer-backed insurance fund is withering.   Mr. Bowsher cited, among other things, the insurancefund's thinnest reserve ratio in its history, expected fundlosses for the third consecutive year, and a decline in thevalue of the bank assets it holds. The fund balance hasdropped to $13.2 billion from $18.3 billion two years ago.   Moreover, the fund is weakest at a time when the industryhas exposed itself to greater risks than in the past.Real-estate lending has increased 12% in the Northeast, forexample, and the region's nonperforming category ofreal-estate loans has more than doubled in the past year.Banks continue to be exposed to highly leveraged transactionsand loans to Third World countries. While risk has increased,Mr. Bowsher said, there has been no relative increase inequity capital, the cushion to absorb losses, for individualbanks.   William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., which oversees both the bank and thrift insurancefunds, said that he agreed with the GAO's projection thatbank fund losses could reach $2 billion this year. Moreover,if Congress gives the FDIC the authority to raise insurancepremiums higher, the FDIC would consider it, he said.   He also hinted that the report may be a political reactionto the Sandamp;L mess. &quot;If I were the GAO, I would cover my rearend, too,&quot; he said.   Kenneth Guenther, of the Independent Bankers Associationof America, said he thought the report was unnecessarilybleak. &quot;This is the darkest this kettle has ever beenpainted. It doesn't do a lot for consumer confidence in thefinancial system.&quot;   But the GAO testimony joins a growing chorus of concernsabout the health of the banking industry from privateeconomists, including Daniel Brumbaugh of Stanford Universityand Robert Litan of Brookings Institution. The CongressionalBudget Office is scheduled to testify on the bank insurancefund today and is expected to warn of an insurance fundstretched too far.   Mr. Bowsher said that assessing the adequacy of the fundis difficult because accounting rules are frequently used tohide, rather than identify, problems. Of the 406 banks thatfailed in 1988 and 1989, some 31 failed without everappearing on the problem-bank list or appearing for only onequarter. The National Bank of Washington failed recently,without ever appearing on the list.   Mr. Bowsher advised regulators to do more on-siteexaminations, rather than rely on potentially misleadingaudits. &quot;Problems are bigger than are being reported,&quot; hesaid.   Mr. Bowsher predicted that 35 banks -- each with assets ofmore than $100 million -- would fail this year, including 15that have already folded. He wouldn't identify them, but saidthat the combined assets of the 35 banks totals $45.1billion. The group was culled from a pool studied by the GAOthat included the 100 largest banks and 200 of the largestproblem banks. None of the 35 are among the 20 largest banks,Mr. Bowsher added.   Government policy is to maintain the fund at $1.25 per$100 of deposits, but currently that figure has dropped toabout 70 cents.   Yesterday's report provoked a flurry of proposals onCapitol Hill by legislators reeling from the Sandamp;L bailout,which is expected to cost at least $130 billion. Sen. RobertDole (R., Kan.) proposed raising an immediate $1 billion forthe fund by assessing U.S. bank deposits held in foreigncountries.   Rep. Frank Annunzio (D., Ill.) said he will introducelegislation today to require banks to pay higher premiums.Some members of the Banking Committee supported Mr. Bowsher'sproposal to raise the insurance premiums before Congressrecesses next month.</TEXT></DOC>
