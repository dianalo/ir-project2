Xerox says it's the company's most significant product introduction since September 1982, when it announced the first model of its &quot;10&quot; series of copiers. That series, now consisting of nine models with list prices between $2,095 and $78,300, won back for a newly aggressive Xerox some of the ground it had lost to competitors.    But some analysts doubt that Stamford, Conn.-based Xerox can duplicate the huge strides it made in 1982. They assume the company has already achieved most of the improvements possible for its plain-paper copier technology.    Nor is Xerox likely to pep up the slow overall growth of the maturing U.S. copier market, where unit sales are rising about 7.5% a year, mostly in new, low-priced models. Analysts estimate that the market, excluding service and supplies, amounts to roughly $8 billion a year. Xerox commands an estimated 35% of total dollar sales, the largest single share.    With its new &quot;50&quot; series, Xerox will confront again both its Japanese rivals at the low end of the market and Eastman Kodak Co. at the high end in the war for market share.    For Xerox customers, analysts think the move may mean more reliable copiers at slightly higher prices than for roughly comparable earlier models. The strength of the yen has forced up prices on competing Japanese machines, enabling Xerox to raise its own list prices on existing models. &quot;There may be some room for Xerox to raise prices and still gain market share,&quot; speculates Eugene G. Glazer, an industry analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.    Xerox declines to divulge details of the models prior to their announcement at the Essex House Hotel here. Among other things, analysts expect the company to enter the market for low-priced personal copiers, the only category in which it hasn't competed before in the U.S. At the high end, Xerox is expected to introduce a duplicator that is faster and more expensive than any it currently sells.    &quot;Xerox is making its presence known again,&quot; says Robert Sostilio, an industry analyst at San Jose, Calif.-based Dataquest. He expects &quot;significant announcements --a broad range of products over all the market segments.&quot;    With its current copiers, called the 10 series because their four-digit model numbers start with 10, Xerox slashed its manufacturing costs as much as 50% and significantly improved its machines' reliability. To build the machines, which used new designs and materials, Xerox embraced Japanese business practices so zealously that it has been called &quot;American Samurai.&quot;    Xerox, which previously introduced one 50 series copier in Europe, has named the series to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Chester Carlson's invention of xerography. Aside from nomenclature, it still isn't clear exactly what advances define this next generation of machines. The new European machine, Model 5048, draws together features, such as variable magnification, that analysts have seen before.    It isn't even clear if any breakthroughs would be possible. Says Daniel Mandresh of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s securities firm: &quot;The old machines do everything but have the copies jump into your lap.&quot;    The old machines also secured a No. 1 position for Xerox last year in four of the seven copier-market segments tracked by Dataquest. Overall, Xerox accounted for an estimated 150,000 of almost 1.2 million copiers sold in the U.S., Dataquest says.    Personal copiers, the market Xerox is expected to enter, are low-volume, portable machines used largely in home offices; industry prices run as low as a few hundred dollars. On the high end of the copier market, where the highest-volume machines are called duplicators, Xerox's fastest machine currently is the Model 9900 (outside the &quot;10&quot; series), which makes 120 copies a minute and lists for $129,775.    Although copiers are still a critical product at Xerox, the company has diversified. Of its $578 million in profit from continuing operations last year, $298 million came from selling and financing business equipment, mostly copiers, and $280 million came from financial services, mostly property and casualty insurance. </TEXT></DOC>
