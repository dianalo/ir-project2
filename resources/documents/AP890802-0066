Speaking to parliament, Rabin also disclosed that the Cabinethad approved Friday's capture of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid two monthsago.   He said final approval was delayed until ``every grain ofpossibility for dialogue'' had been exhausted on winning therelease of three Israeli soldiers believed held in Lebanon.   Rabin said Israel did not inform any other country of itsintentions to abduct Obeid. ``We didn't include any other countrybefore the action and did not even offer information about it,'' hesaid.   The 12-member inner Cabinet of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamiralso met today to discuss the hostage crisis, but there was no wordon the outcome of that meeting.   In his address to parliament, Rabin said Israel has rejected anInternational Red Cross appeal to visit Obeid, who was abductedalong with two associates from the south Lebanon village of Jibchit.   He said Israel would agree only if the Red Cross was able tovisit Israeli captives.   During his 22-minute address, Rabin read anew Israel's offer toswap Lebanese Shiite prisoners held by Israel and for 16 Westernhostages and the three Israelis.   Israel is believed to be holding up to 60 Shiites in Israel, andallied militias in south Lebanon are believed to hold an additional300.   Rabin defended the Obeid kidnap against criticism that Israeldid not consider the dangers to foreign hostages.   ``We took into consideration all the possible reactions,'' hesaid. ``We saw them all, including the actions that already tookplace, and ones even worse.''   A Shiite group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressedon Earth claimed it killed Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins onMonday after Israel refused to free Obeid. A second group saidanother American hostage, Joseph Cicippio, would be killed onThursday unless the cleric is freed.   Israel maintains Higgins was killed several months ago.   Rabin said the Cabinet approved the abduction of Obeid, aspiritual leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah movement that isbelieved an umbrella group for hostage-takers in Lebanon, afterextensive efforts to gain freedom for its captured soldiers. He didnot detail those efforts.   ``So the government of Israel decided to allow the army toapprehend the leader of the Hezbollah in south Lebanon so we wouldhave in our hands valuable property for a prisoner swap,'' he said.   He described the abduction of Obeid, whom he accused ofinvolvement in Higgins kidnap and the abduction of two Israelisoldiers, as ``very successful.''   ``On this stage, I want to send my blessings to the chief ofstaff and the commanders of the army and the unit that carried itout on the way this mission was carried out,'' he said.   Rabin spoke in response to three motions of no confidenceintroduced by three small Arab-oriented parties. The motions in the120-seat body were defeated by a 31-5 vote with one abstention andmost of members absent.   Mainstream opposition groups refused to join in the attack onthe government, saying lives were at stake and criticism should bepostponed.   The defense minister was interrupted at one point by an Arabmember of Parliament, Mohammed Miari, who chided Rabin forannouncing his hostage swap offer 30 minutes after the deadline setfor Higgins' purported hanging.   Communist and Arab legislators accused the government ofkidnapping Obeid to divert attention from efforts to resolve thePalestinian problem and end the uprising against Israeli occupation.</TEXT></DOC>
