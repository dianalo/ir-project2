The assessment takes into account all principal sourcesof radiation exposure including discharges to sea and atmosphere fromDNPDE, discharges to sea from British Nuclear Fuels plc, Sellafield,fallout from nuclear weapons testing, natural background radiation andmedical procedures. Doses via all of the main exposure pathways havebeen estimated either from measurements made in Caithness or elsewhereor, in the case of radionuclide discharges, by using mathematical models.The results show that discharges from DNPDE contribute only a small fractionof the total radiation dose received by members of the population ofThurso and thus a small fraction of the risk of radiation-induced healtheffects.</TEXT></DOC>
