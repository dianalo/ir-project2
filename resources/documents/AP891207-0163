SHEERAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The city's Armenian community gave an ancienttradition a modern twist, laying on a special meal for the homelessto honor victims of the Soviet republic's killer earthquake oneyear ago Thursday.   ``We wanted to show our gratitude for all those who helped us,''said Margaret Zahigian, member of St. Gregory of Narek ArmenianApostolic Church. She referred to those in the community whocontributed time and aid to victims of the Dec. 7, 1988, disaster.   ``Feeding the poor is a good place to start,'' she said afterhelping serve the first of two meals at the City Mission. Sheestimated nearly 200 people would sit down to a turkey dinner.   ``Forty days after a death, we have a requiem service and adinner in honor of the deceased,'' said Florence Karoghlanian,church council president. Although the dinner is not 40 days afterthe deaths _ the biblical time period between the Resurrection ofJesus and the Ascension _ the meal stems from that tradition, shesaid.   The church in suburban Richmond Heights collected $134,000 incash for victims of the quake, which killed more than 25,000people. The donations will be used as seed money to build a city inArmenia, church treasurer Harold Zahigian said.   ``The Cleveland community was very generous in makingcontributions, not only money but also clothing and medicine,''said Matthew J. Hatchadorian, local president of the ArmenianGeneral Benevolent Union. He estimated that there are 1,000 peopleof Armenian descent in the area.   ``We wanted to express our appreciation to all the people inthis community for their response to a horrible tragedy,'' he said.   Church members prepared turkey, candied sweet potatoes,Armenian-style rice pilaf, green beans and pumpkin pie forThursday's meal. A dozen members volunteered to serve the dinnersto 130 men at the City Mission downtown.   ``They're expressing their appreciation to the community andwe're thankful,'' said Tony Lewis, who supervises the homeless menwho work at the mission and receive shelter in return.   The church sent 26 teen-agers to Armenia over the summer tobuild a prefabricated house, the first new residence in thequake-damaged community of Stephanovan.   The church also was host to five children who were treated athospitals in Cleveland and Akron for injuries suffered in theearthquake. All have returned home, Mrs. Karoghlanian said.   The quake's one-year anniversary was also commemorated in otherregions of the country. In the Los Angeles area, several Armeniangroups Thursday held candlelight vigils, memorial church servicesand fund-raising walk-a-thons for the victims of the earthquake.   The observances will extend through the weekend with a blooddrive and memorial services at the several Armenian Apostolicchurches throughout the Southern California.   In New York, the Armenian Philharmonic Orchestra closed itsfirst ever tour of the United States with a special benefit concertThursday night at Carnegie Hall in New York City.   The orchestra, along with American pianist Andre Watts, hasalready appeared in Boston and Washington. Proceeds of the tourwill be used for specific projects in the earthquake zones.</TEXT></DOC>
