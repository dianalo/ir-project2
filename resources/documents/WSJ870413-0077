The consensus forecast still is that they will remain largely flat for the next several months. The 50 analysts polled every month by Blue Chip Financial Forecasts, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, on the average expect rates to remain largely unchanged into this year's third quarter. After that, they expect rates to start edging higher.    A growing minority of economists, however, think the rate upswing is already under way. They expect rates to move higher -- perhaps sharply higher. The reasons include a stronger economy, higher inflation, a weak dollar and the big budget and trade deficits.    &quot;We think interest rates are heading sharply higher,&quot; say the analysts at the brokerage firm of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette. &quot;We still expect that today's perceptions of sluggish economic performance will give way to realizations of a vigorous reacceleration in industrial activity. Greater than expected economic strength will tend to stabilize or boost the external value of the U.S. dollar. But it also makes further increases in U.S. interest rates inevitable.&quot;    The National Association of Purchasing Management each month surveys 250 industrial executives on the state of their business. Last week the poll showed the largest increases in new orders in nearly three years. The economy, an association spokesman says, &quot;is on a good track.&quot;    The consumer price index has been rising at an annual rate of over 5% since late last year. That compares with a 1.9% rise for all 1986. The surge in part may be a temporary blip: Petroleum prices stopped falling and moved upward but now have stabilized. But the Blue Chip analysts, who failed to foresee the blip, do think inflation will be accelerating this year and into 1988.    When inflation rises, interest rates are never far behind. Lenders insist on it, since they want to retain the purchasing power of their funds. Bond purchasers don't enjoy months like March; the brokerage firm of Salomon Brothers reported that price declines in the domestic bond market last month produced negative total returns for the first time since May 1986. That sort of situation leads to higher interest rates.    The weaker dollar also could lead to higher interest rates. The aim of dollar devaluation is to make U.S. imports more expensive and U.S. exports cheaper, and thus to help cut the trade deficit. There are indications it is beginning to do that, with some inflationary effects in the U.S. But Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker last week said the dollar might fall too far.    The fall of the dollar is forcing economic restructuring in our trading partners, especially Japan and Germany. Economic troubles abroad could dry up markets for American exports, perhaps making the trade deficit worse, not better.    If the dollar has fallen far enough, how might Mr. Volcker stop it? The weapon closest to hand is tighter money, which would lead -- at least in the short term -- to higher interest rates. The Fed now manages money mainly by varying the pressure it puts on bank reserve positions, and the reports of the policy-making Open Market Committee meetings so far this year indicate the Fed has opted for what's called &quot;snugging up&quot; -- somewhat more pressure on reserves. The Federal Reserve may not pay as much attention to the money supply as it once did, but money, however defined, has been growing much more slowly than it did in 1986.    Mr. Volcker is well aware that snugging up and pushing interest rates higher could at some point push the U.S. into a recession. The Fed is walking a tightrope, trying to keep money scarce enough to prevent what it believes could be a disastrous fall of the dollar but not scarce enough to bring on an economic collapse.    Is there no way out? Mr. Volcker last week pleaded again for stronger steps to reduce the budget deficit. The Treasury has to rely on a heavy inflow of foreign capital to help fund its debt, and a weaker dollar makes U.S. securities less attractive investments for foreigners -- and thus puts more upward pressure on interest rates.    The finance ministers of the major industrial democracies met in Washington last week, supposedly to reaffirm their dedication to exchange rate stability. There was talk again of new measures to stimulate foreign economies, especially the Japanese economy. Japan indicated it was ready to stimulate its economy, but Germany wasn't quite prepared to move.    Judicious observers probably will restrain their optimism until they begin to see some results -- on the budget, the trade deficit and exchange stability. Until the results appear, one of the safest bets around is that interest rates in the months ahead are going to move higher. </TEXT></DOC>
