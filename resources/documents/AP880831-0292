He said the most disturbing figures dealt with black Americans,who suffered a significant increase in poverty. The governmentdefined the poverty income level as $11,611 for a family of four in1987, up from $11,203 the previous year.   William P. Butz, the Census Bureau's associate director fordemographic programs, said the nation's ``economic performance, interms of income and poverty, has been mixed'' as usual.   The number of Americans living in poverty last year totaled 32.5million, slightly higher than the 32.4 million reported for 1986.The poverty rate was 13.5 percent, down from 13.6 percent.   Butz said neither change is considered statistically significantbecause they are within the margin of possible error in the report,which was based on a sample of about 60,000 households across thecountry.   It is possible for the poverty rate to decline even when morepeople are poor because the size of the population is growingfaster than the number of people living in poverty.   Median family income last year was $30,850, up from $30,534 theyear before, the bureau said.   The poverty report was likely to generate controversy in thepresidential election campaign because of its bad news for blacks.   President Reagan's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said inCalifornia that the report provides ``further evidence that themost effective means of improving the life of Americans is astrong, productive economy.''   Fitzwater said the increase in poverty among blacks ``obviouslyis disappointing,'' but that women were ``making the greatestgains.''   ``We think this is a good report,'' Fitzwater said. ``Itdocuments a decrease in poverty, a continuing rising income andreflects a growing, strong economy.''   Butz saw the figures somewhat differently.   ``The poverty rate for blacks increased, but not for whites,''Butz said. ``Income went up for whites, but not for blacks.'' ButButz said it is premature to consider this a trend.   The poverty rate for blacks increased from 31.1 percent in 1986to 33.1 percent last year, the study said, meaning the number ofblacks living in poverty rose from 8.9 million to 9.7 million.   Median family income for blacks fell from $18,247 to $18,098,while the median income for white families rose from $31,935 to$32,274.   The poverty rate for whites dipped from 11 percent to 10.5percent, indicating there were 21.4 million whites living inpoverty last year _ down from 22.2 million a year earlier.   For Hispanics the poverty rate rose from 27.3 percent to 28.2percent and median family income fell from $20,726 to $20,306. Thenumber of Hispanics in poverty rose from 5.1 million to 5.4 million.   Median family income means half of all families receive morethan that amount and half less. Statisticians prefer medians as astandard of comparison because a few families with extraordinarilyhigh incomes can distort an average.   Hispanics cannot be counted in figures for blacks and whitesbecause Hispanics are an ethnic rather than a racial group andalready are included in figures for both blacks and whites,officials said.   Farmers got good news in the report. The farm poverty rateplummeted from 19.6 percent in 1986 to 12.6 percent last year,meaning the number of farm residents living in poverty declinedfrom 996,000 to 616,000.   Butz said that while he had no immediate explanation for thedecline, but cautioned that the figures do not reflect the economichardships that farmers suffered because of this summer's widespreaddrought.   The study found that women's incomes continue to trail those ofmen. It said women receive about 65 percent of males' take-homepay, a percentage that has remain unchanged since 1984.   Families headed by a female with no husband present had apoverty rate of 34.3 percent, down slightly from 34.6 percent in1986. Families headed by a man with no wife present had a povertyrate of 12.5 percent, up from 11.4 percent the year before.   Children under age 18 had a poverty rate of 20.0 percent, notstatistically different from the 19.8 percent of a year earlier.The rate for persons 65 and older was 12.2 percent, down from 12.4percent in 1986.   Even so, children made up about 40 percent of the nation's poorlast year and the elderly accounted for 10.7 percent, meaning morethan half of all poor people were the oldest and youngest Americans.   The report said the poorest 20 percent of Americans account foronly 4.6 percent if all income, a share that has declined from 5.5percent in 1967.   Over the same period, the wealthiest 20 percent increased theirshare of all income from 40.4 percent to 43.7 percent.   The 60 percent of people in the middle received 54.1 percent ofall income in 1967 and 51.7 percent last year.   Butz said the poverty figures count only cash income, notanti-poverty programs such as food stamps, subsidized housing andMedicare. If those benefits counted as income, he said, the U.S.povetry rate would decline to between 8 percent and 12.5 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
