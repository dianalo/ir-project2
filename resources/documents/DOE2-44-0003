At an OPEC meeting in June, no visible progress was made onproduction quotas, cooperation with non-OPEC countries, or quota definitions.The big Arab producers favored a quota increase, but the meeting endedwith a decision to carry over the existing system for the rest of theyear. Indications are that OPEC overproduction will continue to expand,a notable development being the prospect of the United Arab Emirateswithdrawing from the quota system. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have increasedoutput by 2/3 since August 1985, and Iraq has opted out of the quotasystem while also boosting output. Other OPEC members are faced withsevere economic pressures and favor tighter quotas to push up prices.In the consuming countries, there has been a slightly higher growth indemand than was expected, but this trend will not suffice to increaseoil prices unless OPEC can strengthen its ability to limit production.6 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
