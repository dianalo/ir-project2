(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wind gusts to 85 mphfanned forest fires that gutted 17 buildings near Old Faithful,while two Montana men reported missing after flames engulfed theirhome were found today.   ``Trees were just popping like matchsticks,'' said Robert Lee, afirefighter from Auburn, Ala. ``There were winds at least 85 mph.''   Temperatures here dropped into the 30s and winds died downovernight, and firefighters expected calmer weather throughSaturday. Forecasters said a storm could bring rain or snow overthe weekend.   Wildfires also forced the evacuations of 50 homes in theShoshone National Forest in Wyoming east of Yellowstone and twodozen homes and a Boy Scout camp near Boulder and Golden, Colo.Fire crews continued to protect two Montana towns near Yellowstonefrom a huge fire, and battled blazes in Idaho, California, Oregon,Washington and Utah.   In northwest Montana along the Flathead River, authorities hadfeared that a man and his brother were caught in the flames afterrefusing an evacuation order.   But the men were found this morning along the river corridorbordering Glacier National Park.   ``They have been located and they are all right,'' said MadelynKempf, fire information officer.   Although federal officials have called this the worst fireseason in 30 years, no fatalities have been directly attributed tothe blazes, which have charred 3.65 million acres, an area largerthan Connecticut.   Last month, a helicopter involved in battling a blaze inWyoming's Bighorn National Forest crashed after losing power,killing a passenger, a Bureau of Land Management technician.   Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., and others have criticized the ParkService for waiting too long to fight some of the fires because ofa policy to allow fires in wilderness areas to burn for thebenefits they bring to forests.   Wallop met Wednesday with Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel andurged William Penn Mott, director of the National Park Service, toresign.   The northwest Montana blaze, discovered Tuesday, expanded to anestimated 7,500 acres by early today and moved into GlacierNational Park, where it burned a ranger station complex andnumerous cabins.   Four hikers near the park's Lower Quartz Lake were rescued byhelicopter Wednesday afternoon after flames cut off their escaperoute and they drove their vehicle into the lake to save it.   More than 100 people who live in the area were evacuated, andtwo park campgrounds were evacuated.   At Yellowstone, tourist Ken Miller of Denver was one of morethan 100 visitors who left the Old Faithful area in a convoy led byrangers Wednesday night as embers from the nearby 221,800-acreNorth Fork fire descended.   ``I've been coming up here a long time,'' Miller said. ``ThankGod I've got a lot of pictures of the way the park was, becauseI'll never see it like that again.''   The fire is one of 13 major blazes covering more than 1 millionacres in and around the 2.2 million-acre park.   Earlier, flames destroyed two cabins in the complex's southernend, while embers carried by the winds ignited 14 guest cabins anda utility shed at the main part of the complex, said Fire CommanderDenny Bungarz.   But because the fire exhausted fuel as it passed through,officials did not expect to see similar damaging flames again.   About 200 firefighters protected other structures, including thehistoric Old Faithful Inn, where a sprinkler line on the roof wasactivated. Firefighters also sprayed flame-retardant foam on theroof.   Overnight visitors to Old Faithful were asked to leave Wednesdaymorning. It was the first-ever evacuation of the most populartourist attraction at the 116-year-old park in Wyoming's northwestcorner.   But park officials admitted day visitors until late Wednesdayafternoon, when stiff winds whipped up a blaze on the area'ssouthern border and blew embers into the complex, igniting roofs ofbuildings.   ``When that firestorm went through there, we had to move ourpeople out of there,'' Bungarz said. ``When you can feel the heatinside your car, it's time to move.''   East of Yellowstone, Shoshone forest officials evacuated atleast 50 ranches and summer homes in a sparsely populated areabecause of rapid growth of the 260,000-acre Clover Mist fire.   But the National Weather Service said a storm front could carrysignificant rain or even snow for Wyoming this weekend, providingrelief.   Along Yellowstone's northern border, high winds drove a backfirealong the northern edge of Cooke City and nearby Silver Gate. Thefire singed the fringes of the Montana towns but created a bufferof charred timber in advance of the 119,000-acre StormCreek-Hellroaring fire.   ``Now, with the fuels burned out, at least on this side of thevalley, there won't be anything left to burn,'' said Bill Stalker,a fire information officer.   However, officials remained concerned that winds could shift anddrive the main fire into dry, unburned timber south of the canyontowns by this weekend. The blaze remained about a mile from thetowns Wednesday, officials said.   Firefighters sprayed foam on buildings in Cooke Pass, 2{ mileseast of Cooke City, and saved about 40 structures before thesearing flames drove crews out.</TEXT></DOC>
