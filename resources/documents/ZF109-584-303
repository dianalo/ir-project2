Co, addressed the 14thLeasing Digest Conference on Equipment Leasing, he ruefully acknowledged thatlease accounting has acquired a bad name in the UK since the collapse ofAtlantic Computers and Blackspur Leasing.andP;  However, even if the Atlanticbusiness has tarnished the reputation of the accountancy profession, Pagequite rightly points out that the demise of leasing companies isn't aphenomenon of the 1990s.andP;  In the early 1980s there were five leasingcompanies quoted on the London Stock Exchange, and by the time of Atlantic'sdownfall, United Leasing, Dataserv, Comcap and IBL had all been acquired.andM;Guilty of front-loadingandM;Consequently, there are now no publicly-quoted leasing companies.andP;  Pagebelieves there is a feature common to the various collapses and it relates tothe method adopted for recognising profit.andP;  Most were guilty of front-loadingincome, which means there is little or no income left in later years.andP;  Solong as these companies were experiencing dramatic growth, the consequencesof aggressive income recognition weren't apparent, but when the growth ratedeclined, financial performance suffered.andP;  Page also believes that the maincause of the difficulties experienced by leasing companies has beenaccounting for residual values, which involves a great deal of risk becauseof changing technology.andP;  Operators like Atlantic would normally refinance alease and bear the residual payment which is represented by a final balloonpayment to the refinancing bank.andP;  But as Page points out, it is important toreview periodically the dealer's residual value commitments against currentestimates of realisable values of the equipment and provide for any lossesarising.andP;  These commitments should be disclosed in financial statementstogether with the related accounting policy.andP;  As regards upgrades or flexoptions, Page says that there is no particular accounting issue arising solong as the lease documentation makes clear which party is to bear any losson the disposal of surrendered equipment, and losses normally arise if thelessor has adopted an aggressive residual position or an event in the markethas led to a deterioration in residuals.andP;  Page says that from press articles,it appears that Atlantic salesmen were abusing this system.andP;  It is allegedthat when customers realised they had to bear the cost of obsolete kit, thesalesmen loaded high rentals onto the new equipment contract towards the endof the new lease, usually after the flex point.andP;  As customer requirementswere always changing, it was argued that upgrades would always be requiredand the contract would never go beyond the flex point.andP;  Consequently, thehigher rentals would never be reached and losses could be rolled forwardindefinitely.andP;  Page contends that these problems are less the result of atheoretically flawed accounting practice than an imprudent application ofsound accounting policies - although layfolk may wonder if an accountingpractice that permits such imprudence is not theoretically flawed.andM;By Janice McGinnandM;That is how the accountant interprets events at Atlantic, and James Watters,a partner in Stephenson Harwood, went on to present the legal view.andP;  Hedefines the computer lessor as a broker with a clear objective - to get themaximum amount of money in the shortest time with the minimum of risk.andP;  Hesays that the meaning of Atlantic's flex agreement was extremely obscure, butthe real problem arose from the walk which enabled Atlantic to trade on thegood covenant of the lessee to raise a sum equal to a couple of years' rent.andO;However, something went wrong and Watters says we are now in a fascinatingsituation where lawyers are generating large legal fees trying to ascertainwho has rights of possession, who has liability, and whether head lessors mayterminate leases.andP;  He suggests that a framework for future computer leasingmust meet several criteria.andP;  It must not give rise to any doubts over theentitlement of the owner to full tax benefits, and that must be taken intoconsideration when pricing the deal.andP;  Secondly, the risk of non-performanceof any agreements by brokers to provide walks and flexes must be carried bythe user.andP;  Thirdly, he believes that it should not be necessary for thefinancier to be caught up in problems arising from any administration of thebroker, and perhaps most important, the lessee should clearly understand theimplications of any arangements to which he is party.andP;  The components of sucha framework ought to include a straightforward direct lease between thefinancier and user for a period of years to which the lessee is willing to becommitted to paying rent.andP;  This is coupled with an acknowledgement by thelessee to the lessor that if there are any agreements - preceding orsubsequent to the lease - to which the lessor is not party, then theprovisions of the lease prevail.andP;  Next, there should be a managementagreement between the lessor and broker covering terms under which the brokerwill be permitted to arrange early termination of the lease and arrangementsunder which the residual value will be recaptured and/or underwritten by thebroker.andP;  And lastly, financiers should be prepared to underwrite enough ofthe residual value of a machine to ensure that the lease is off balancesheet.andP;  Lessees seem to occupy a secondary position in the world of lawyersand accountants, but Bernard Jones, an ex-IBMer and now senior analyst withGartner Group UK Ltd, attempted to speak for users and describe theirreactions after Atlantic.andP;  While acknowledging that generalisations aredangerous, Jones says that the lessee community has been characterised by adeep-seated ignorance of the true significance of contracts into which it hasbeen freely prepared to enter.andM;Something for nothingandM;He believes this ignorance was manifest in the questions raised in theimmediate aftermath of Atlantic, and in the amount that has been taken ontrust.andP;  All too often, there was an implied expectation on the part of theuser of something for nothing, and that was not discouraged by unscrupulousoperators.andP;  Consequently, users are reappraising financing choices andchanging their perception of leasing as an option.andP;  Lessee behaviour,according to Jones, falls into one of four categories.andP;  Some users arerejecting leasing as a financing alternative and adopting the baby andbathwater approach.andP;  Others are playing safe and handing over their businessto vendor-captive companies in the belief that this assures them ofsatisfactory contractual terms and conditions coupled with attractivepricing.andP;  However, they are overlooking the vendor's motivation and the factthat IBM now writes leases on 65% of new leased mainframes, that Fujitsu viaICL will soon enter the leasing market, that DEC is about to embark on amajor expansion, and that both Amdahl and Hitachi are involved in operatingleases.andP;  The third group is continuing to use operating leases, but aresubjecting proposals and proposers to a much more rigorous scrutiny than wasformerly the case.andP;  Jones reckons there is a also fourth group, the innocentsthat continue to ignore precedent and carry on as before.andP;  He believes thatthe interests of information technology user can be best served by anongoing, competitive leasing industry.andP;  That can only be achieved if bothlessors and lessees have a structured negotiating approach, and each cancomprehend the other's motivation and objectives.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
