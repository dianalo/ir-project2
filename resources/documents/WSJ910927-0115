Employing the immigrants in businesses that holdtheir own in world markets is the hard one. Even $10 billionin guaranteed loans will leave the country $20 to $30 billionshort of the investment capital it will need to put theimmigrants to work.

Unemployment is at 12% and climbing.</LP><TEXT>   In the 1950s and 1960s, when Israel was flooded by NorthAfrican immigrants, the government and Histradrut laborfederation made work by investing in huge, labor-intensivemanufacturing concerns that substituted domestic products forimports -- textiles, food-processing, appliances. But inrecent years most of those public-sector enterprises haveproven unequal to global competition.   No wonder. The local market is small, and unskilled laborcosts four times as much as in Malaysia, twice as much as inSingapore. Global companies spend enormous resources ondesigning and redesigning their products. More important,they have muscle in distribution channels. Few Israelicompanies can compete with this kind of marketing advantage,no matter how brilliant the end-product. And if the productis truly brilliant, how long before a Korean company knocksit off?   The government has tried to compensate for thesedisadvantages with low-interest loans and tax holidays to newexporters. But subsidies hit and miss, and Israel's manyunprofitable manufacturing ventures swell budget deficits andfuel inflation (it was 1000% in 1984).   So there is no way of getting around it. Israelis now needto work not in questionable domestic manufacturing but inprofitable enterprises that support global manufacturing.They need to specialize in supplier industries that make useof their competitive advantage: brainpower.   Brainpower is more valuable than oil, and for its size,Israel has the world's largest proven reserves of it. Israelhas more scientists and technicians per capita and thehighest rates of literacy and math skills of any nation onthe planet. Israelis read the most books and newspapers.Israel publishes more technical and scientific papers percapita than any other country, 10 times as many as therunner-up -- the U.S.   The Russian immigrants have even higher levels oftechnical education than the population receiving them: Fortypercent have 13 to 15 years of schooling; 16%, more than 16years. Michael Bruno, the former governor of the Bank ofIsrael, asserts that successfully absorbing a million Russianimmigrants would mean doubling the value of Israel's humancapital.   When Israel's brainpower has been focused by theproduction plans of global players the results have beenimpressive. Motorola has conducted some of its most advancedresearch into cellular communications in Israel; more than50% of Motorola-Israel's sales, now more than $300 million ayear, is the fruit of local research and development. Inteldid some of its most important work on the 386 microprocessorin Israel. National Semiconductor developed its 100million-instructions-per-second &quot;swordfish&quot; chip in Israel.   High-science, low-labor strategies could even make Israelimanufacturing profitable, especially since Israel enjoys afree-trade agreement with the U.S. The precision machiningcenters of Iscar Ltd., a privately held company, exportedsome $120 million in finished parts to the U.S. and Europe in1989.   Israel's future lies in developing many, many small,high-tech companies: software boutiques, specialty chiphouses, biotech niche players, medical equipment designers,computer integrated manufacturing consultants. There is alsoa place for precision manufacturing. But with few exceptions(Elcint's CAT-scanners spring to mind) Israeli companies willnot make products foreign consumers will ever see. The mostnatural customers for Israeli exports will not be Westernconsumers, but rather other, bigger companies. It is easy toimagine a number of Japanese companies -- excellent inmanufacturing, light on software -- prospecting for help asMotorola and Intel have done.   This does not mean that Israel's opportunity is small.International trade in high-tech is increasing much faster incomponents than in finished goods. Between 1985 and 1989,U.S. imports of consumer electronics rose about 15%. Butimports of electronic parts rose nearly 70%, and imports ofsolid-state parts more than doubled. Israel, a stateeducationally and demographically much like Massachusetts,has one-tenth the number of people working in high-tech.   Israel's immediate problem is that when Israeli brainpoweris not absorbed into the programs of global companies it isworth about as much as oil in a world without engines. Norcan Israeli entrepreneurs be expected to learn about theirmarkets by reading Upside magazine or flying off to San Jose.The only way for a sufficient number of Israelis to beexposed to the needs of their potential customers -- and toearn their trust -- is through relationships established whenglobal companies set up in Israel. There are now about 20 ofthese; there should be 200 and more.   Israeli officials show signs of being on to this logic.The government recently announced yet another new system ofincentives, this time to encourage Randamp;D investment. Theprogram funds, among other things, 20% of overhead expensesfor foreign companies that subcontract Randamp;D work to Israelicompanies. A $100 million binational research and developmentfund encourages partnerships between Israeli and Americanentrepreneurs.   Unfortunately, this kind of encouragement forscience-based ventures pales next to a much greaterdiscouragement to global companies -- the violent strugglebetween Israelis and Palestinians. The vast majority ofglobal companies stay away simply because Israel seems toounpredictable a place to them or because they have beenthreatened with reprisals by Arab oil exporters. MostJapanese companies have discreetly accepted the terms of theArab economic boycott. So have many mid-sized Germancompanies. A Pax Americana in the region would improve thispicture overnight, but the terms of such a peace will includeautonomy -- at the least -- for the Palestinians.   So Mr. Shamir can have the Whole Land of Israel or a pieceof Toshiba's development work; another West Bank settlementor the confidence of Western banks. This is Israel's realchoice. President Bush's opposition to loan guarantees hasonly brought it into relief. Then again, with so many newbreadwinners to provide for, is there any choice at all?   ---   Mr. Avishai teaches business at Adelphi University on LongIsland.
