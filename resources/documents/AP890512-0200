Ambassadors Say U.S.-Noriega Dispute Is One for OAS</HEAD><BYLINE>By WILLIAM E. SCHULZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The dispute between the United States andPanamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega should be settledthrough the Organization of American States, four former U.S.ambassadors to the United Nations agreed Friday.   Going to the OAS ``would allow an opportunity for countries ofthe hemisphere to react,'' said Donald McHenry, who served in theUnited Nations under former President Carter. ``This is the samecourse the U.S. followed in persuading (former dictator) AnastasioSomoza to leave Nicaragua.''   ``A U.N. role at this point would only confuse and complicatethe situation,'' agreed John Scali, who served in the worldorganization under former President Nixon.   The two were joined by Andrew Young, who also was U.N.ambassador under Carter, and Arthur Goldberg, who was LyndonJohnson's U.N. envoy. The four held a news conference prior totaping of a panel discussion on the United Nations for the SouthernCenter for International Studies.   President Bush announced Thursday that he was sending nearly2,000 additional combat troops into Panama to protect Americancitizens from the violence that erupted in the aftermath ofNoriega's decision Wednesday to annul the results of Panama'spresidential election.   Scali rated Bush's handling of the Panamanian situation a 9 outof 10, adding, ``I think Mr. Bush is far more cautious (thanPresident Reagan) and far more conscious of the need to bringCongress along with him as an ally.''   ``He's doing a fairly good job,'' said Goldberg, but he added,``I don't know why we are sending about 2,000 more troops there. Wehave about 10,000 there.''   There must be ``diplomatic efforts to join in condemning thishorrible business that Noriega has entered into. He ought to becondemned by the international community, beginning with the LatinAmerican states,'' Goldberg said.   Scali called the sending of additional troops ``a message, asignal to the Panamanian people they are not alone'' against whathe called the ``savage brutality'' of the Noriega leadership.   Settling the dispute ``is the very thing OAS is best expected todo,'' said Young, who is now Atlanta's mayor. ``It's better thatwhatever suggestions are made come from the Latin Americansthemselves and the United States not be the one to come up with THEplan.''   McHenry said he believes there is no danger to Americans livingin Panama and troops sent there will not find themselves in combatwith Panamanian defense forces.</TEXT></DOC>
