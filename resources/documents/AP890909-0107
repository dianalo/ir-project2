But an opera spokesman said the protest wasmisdirected.   ``The audience that these people irritated are the people who arepaying for AIDS benefits in San Francisco. It was the wrong audienceto do this in front of,'' Tom Illgen, the opera's marketingdirector, said after Friday night's demonstration.   The protesters were members of the group Stop AIDS Now or Else,also known as SANE. Members of the same group blocked off the GoldenGate Bridge during rush hour for about 45 minutes on Jan. 31 beforebeing arrested. Police made no arrests Friday night.   Shortly after the conductor took his place and the orchestraprepared to strike the opening chords of ``Falstaff,'' theprotesters stormed through the aisles.   ``We are demanding that those in attendance tonight wield theirpower to make ending the AIDS epidemic a national priority,'' agroup statement said.   As the activists chanted, threw leaflets and displayed banners,the orchestra played the national anthem, and members of theaudience stood and sang along, Illgen said.   ``I don't think the message that was meant to get across gotacross,'' he said.   Opera staffers carried and shoved the protesters out of theauditorium, Illgen said.   He said the 30-minute protest upset the opera audience, whichincluded singer Linda Ronstadt and actor Raoul Julia, ``but it wasnot a big problem because opening night goes up about 20 minuteslate anyway.''
