STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>GOERLITZ, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Soldiers armed with blowtorches cutup the gun barrels of battle tanks while other troops ripped theframes apart to demonstrate how serious this country is aboutdisarmament.   ``This is not an empty show put on for the world's benefit,''Col. Joachim Nicolaus said Wednesday during a tour for Westernjournalists. ``We are holding true to the intention to destroy theseweapons, and you are witnesses to the fulfillment of this pledge.''   Officials showed reporters some of the 600 medium-sized tanks thegovernment says it plans to dismantle as part of a unilateraldecision to trim its conventional arsenal.   East Germany in January announced it was reducing its armedforces by 600 tanks, 10,000 troops and 50 combat aircraft. It plansto complete the cuts by next year. According to East German figures,the country's armed forces have 3,140 battle tanks.   Nicolaus, commander of the two bases along East Germany'ssoutheastern border with Poland, said more than 130 tanks had beenbrought to the site to be scrapped or converted for civilian use.   About 150 of the 36-ton tanks will be modified for use in heavyindustry, mainly in the nation's coal mining operations, said Col.Helmut Erdmann, a military spokesman. He said the remaining 450Soviet-type T-55A tanks will be destroyed.   Some spare parts and sophisticated equipment will be salvaged, hesaid.   Reporters saw more than 11 tanks in various stages of demolitionat the first base near Charlottenhof.   Huge cranes lifted the tanks' six-ton turrets from their armoredframes, dumping them in neat rows where soldiers stripped them oftheir inch-thick, anti-radiation interior coating.   Other soldiers removed machine guns while their comrades usedacetylene torches to cut 15-foot-long, 100mm gun barrels into smallpieces.   At the second installation near the town of Ostritz, soldierswere busy in workshops melting down machine guns and breaking up thethickly armored tank bodies into small chunks. The Ostritz facilityfinishes the job begun near Charlottenhof.   Piles of metal and other tank parts were scattered across bothcompounds. Near a jumble of former gun carriages, a sign read:``Cannon Junk.''   Erdmann said most of the tanks were five to 15 years old.   ``We're not just throwing out ancient clunkers,'' he said.``These tanks still have a lot of mileage left in them.''   Olaf Windisch, a 19-year-old soldier from the industrial city ofLeipzig, said he had mixed emotions about the demolition.   ``You put a lot of work in keeping these tanks in combat shapeand you develop an affection for them, the same as people getattached to cars,'' said Windisch, wiping perspiration from his browafter removing armor plating from the inside of a gun turret.   ``But I grew up in a time of peace and I don't want to see war.I'm glad we're getting rid of some weapons.''   Commandant Nicolaus said he had seen some difficult moments amongcrews selected to consign their tanks to the junk pile.   ``I've seen tank commanders stroke the sides of their machineswith tears in their eyes,'' he said. ``That was their tank and theydidn't want to part with it.''</TEXT></DOC>
