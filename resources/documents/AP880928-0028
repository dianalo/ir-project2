When that happens, he says, ``You fought the odds and you won.''   Curtis, of Houston, has fought the odds and won in four decadesin the oil patch, creating technology that has earned him areputation as someone who has moved the industry to new frontiers.   A retired vice president of the energy giant Conoco Inc., Curtiswas being inducted today into the National Academy of Engineeringfor his pioneering efforts in offshore oil production and storage.   Curtis is considered the father of tension-leg platformtechnology in offshore oil and gas production that will allowConoco to begin unprecedented production next year in 1,760 feet ofwater offshore Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico.   The rig will be the world's deepest offshore productionplatform. Unlike a conventional platform that sits on an elaboratesteel or concrete structure anchored to the seabed, the tension legplatform is a floating structure tethered to the seabed withtubular steel mooring lines.   Curtis says he believes the tension leg platform technology willallow production in even deeper waters as oilmen search for newreserves to replace depleted supplies and attempt to ease thenation's dependence on foreign oil.   ``The big stuff is farther out _ it's going to be in thefrontier areas,'' he says.   Conoco is considering the platform's use to retrieve reserves at3,000 feet but additional technology is needed to produce oil atdepths of 7,000 feet, where Curtis believes most supplies will bediscovered.   ``But there's nothing that says we can't do it,'' Curtis saidTuesday. ``It's tough technology to design, but it's not any worsethan airplanes.''   Curtis, who joined Conoco in 1949 and retired from theHouston-based subsidiary of Du Pont Co., in January, also iscredited with installing the industry's first computer-basedoilfield automation system and with developing 500,000-barrelundersea storage tanks for use in the waters off Dubai in thePersian Gulf, where no deep water port was available for tankers toretrieve the oil.   ``Whether as a young engineer fresh out of the Colorado Schoolof Mines or as a tested veteran of the oil fields of the world,Buck Curtis has consistently exhibited the drive, the creativityand the sound judgment of a man dedicated to improving currentconcepts of petroleum engineering and creating new ones,'' CharlesDiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute, said Tuesdayat a lunch honoring Curtis' induction into engineering academy.   ``I don't feel I was a pioneer,'' said Curtis, 64. ``I wastrying to find a solution to a problem.''   He says such technology is in the embryonic stage, but mustovercome the concern among some environmentalists that offshoredrilling is harmful to marine life.   ``I don't believe anything is destructed,'' he said. ``It may beaffected. I think the West Coast has a lot of potential, and Alaskais a frontier area that may be the biggest of all.''</TEXT></DOC>
