Officials said the emigre floodcould exceed 15,000.   About 11,000 had arrived in West Germany by Tuesday night,Bavarian border officials said.   Communist East Germany issued a strong, formal protest toHungary's reform-minded government for permitting the exodus anddemanded the movement be halted. Both East Germany and Hungary areWarsaw Pact nations.   Most of the new East German emigres are skilled young workers andtheir families, fed up with conditions in their hard-line homeland.Many went straight to relatives already living in West Germany.Others were being temporarily put up at refugee camps.   East Germans who had camped outside the West German Embassy inPrague, Czechoslovakia, also hoping to go West, gave up afterpromises they would not be punished. Some had been there for weeks.   Officials in Hungary said thousands more East Germans werearriving in that communist country, which opened its doors to theWest at midnight Sunday when about 60,000 East German vacationerswere in Hungary.   The officials suggested that the flow of refugees to the West hadpeaked, saying the number of East German visitors was usual for thistime of year.   Hungarian officials sought to soft-pedal suggestions that most ofthe more than 50,000 East Germans reported on vacation in Hungarycould join others who had formally requested to leave for a new lifein the West.   They said only 210 East Germans registered overnight withauthorities at a refugee camp in Hungary coordinating the exoduswestward.   Hungary attracts tens of thousands of East German vacationerseach year. Traditionally it has been relatively easy for most EastGermans to get permission to go there, but far harder to getapproval for visiting the West.   Residents in the border city of Passau greeted new arrivals withcheers, hugs and offers of jobs and shelter. Tent camps and areception area were set up for the emigres.   ``This reception is really amazing,'' said Ute Kindl, a refugee.``I'm really speechless over the warmness and kindness here.''   A large banner outside the center bore the words ``HerzlichWillkommen'' (Heartfelt Greetings). Red and silver helium balloonswith the same message bobbed in the welcoming crowd. Bulletin boardslisted jobs and apartments.   One East German man, a 33-year-old who only identified himself asDietrich, said he had no idea where he wanted to settle. ``But itwill work out.''   Like many of the young emigres, Dietrich said he was fed up withthe communist government and economic conditions back home.   Labor Minister Gebhard Glueck in the West German state of Bavariapredicted that the total number of East Germans seizing advantage ofthe chance to emigrate ``could top 15,000.''   East Germany's state ADN news agency released a governmentstatement calling for ``immediate rescinding'' of Hungary's decisionto ``unilaterally suspend'' Hungarian-East German agreements onborder controls.   It said the protest was sent to the Foreign Ministry in Budapest.   Romania and Czechoslovakia, both Warsaw Pact states, accused WestGermany on Tuesday of trying to lure East Germans to the West, butoffered only guarded criticism of their ally, Hungary.   The exodus began after Hungary defied a 1969 agreement with EastGermany and opened its borders for thousands of East Germans tosettle in the West.   It comes at a time of dramatic change in the East bloc. Polandhas installed its first government in four decades not led bycommunists, and Hungary is implementing political reforms.   The East Germans, arriving in private cars, buses and trains,were exhausted but jubilant over Hungary's move.   ``We'll never be able to repay them for this,'' said HeinzSchmidt, who came from Jena, East Germany.   The arrivals filled five temporary camps near the Austrian borderin Bavaria. Officials were seeking more shelter areas in militarybarracks.   At a news conference in Passau, chief government spokesman HansKlein criticized East Germany for calling the exodus `illegal'' anda ``provocation organized at high levels.''   ``It's stone-age verbiage that they have reacted with. If thereis a provocation it's a provocation for freedom,'' Klein said.   Klein said 8,000 job offers for the refugees were received inPassau alone.   In Prague, more than half of about 400 East Germans gave up theirvigil at the West German Embassy, leaving after East Germanauthorities promised them they will not be punished if they returnedhome.   Maj. Janos Hornyak of the Hungarian border guards told TheAssociated Press 6,529 East Germans arrived in Hungary between 6:30a.m. Monday and 9:30 a.m. Tuesday. He said 3,220 East Germans leftfor home over the same time via Czechoslovakia, which lies betweenHungary and East Germany.   He said most entered from Czechoslovakia. The rest _ presumablyvacationers on the Bulgarian or Romanian Black Sea coast _ came fromRomania, he said. He said the figures were normal for this time ofyear.   The Soviet Union sent a hard-line Politburo member, YegorLigachev, to East Berlin. ADN did not state the purpose of the trip,but it was presumed Ligachev and East German officials would discussHungary's role in the refugee affair.</TEXT></DOC>
