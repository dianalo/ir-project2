Helen Suzman said National Party leader F.W. de Klerk ``shouldnow ... tell us and the world what he definitely will do ... torestore peace at home and respectability abroad.''   It is virtually certain that De Klerk, 53, will succeedPresident P.W. Botha, who steps down after Sept. 6 generalelections.   Since becoming leader of the governing party in February, deKlerk has pledged to seek an end to racial discrimination. But hehas been vague about the type of power-sharing he might extend tothe disenfranchised black majority.   Mrs. Suzman, 71, who announced on Wednesday she would end her36-year parliamentary career, said de Klerk ``must put thecountry's interests above those of the National Party.'' She urgedhim to use his influence to curtail government actions that mightantagonize people.   ``Deaths in detention, more blatant abrogation of due process,more hangings, more forced removals are key provocative issues thatmust be avoided,'' she said.   She suggested that de Klerk declare a moratorium on hangings,suspend residential segregation laws and end efforts to relocateblack communities in tribal homelands.   ``None of these actions would in any way affect the politicalpower structure in South Africa,'' Mrs. Suzman said. ``But theywould contribute to creating a climate in which negotiations toensure a peaceful future could commence,'' she said.   South Africa's racial segregation or apartheid policies give thecountry's 24 million blacks no vote in national affairs. The 5million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts,schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
