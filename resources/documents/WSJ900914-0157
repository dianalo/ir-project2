Trigg, charginghim with defrauding the thrift in a complex scheme to takecontrol of Family using Family's own money.   Mr. Trigg was charged with conspiracy, bank fraud, moneylaundering, false statements and tax fraud. If convicted, hefaces a maximum of 94 years in prison and a $1 million fine.Three others in the case face lesser charges.</LP><TEXT>   According to the indictment, Mr. Trigg, while he wasserving as chairman of the board but held no equity in thethrift, arranged for Family to loan $2.5 million to a thirdparty to develop a real estate property. Then $1.24 millionof the money allegedly was laundered into Mr. Trigg'spersonal bank account and used to buy 51% of Family. He alsoallegedly lied about the transaction to federal regulators.   &quot;The transactions involved in this case are prime examplesof the kind of fraud and self-dealing that appears in so manyof the troubled Sandamp;Ls around the country,&quot; said Assistant U.S.Attorney Maurice A. Leiter, who is prosecuting the case.   Mr. Trigg attracted local media attention in August 1987when he acquired control of the thrift, partly because withassets of more than $140 million, Family was one of thelargest black-owned savings and loans in the nation.   But two months later, the Los Angeles Times published anarticle which triggered an examination by regulators, whocalled in the Federal Bureau of Investigation in early 1988.Mr. Trigg resigned from Family a few months later.   Family is still in operation after Washington, D.C.-basedOFC Inc. acquired control in January. President Wayne-KentBradshaw said the thrift expected to post a small operatingprofit this year and was in compliance with all federalregulations.   Mr. Trigg's attorney Arthur Barens said of the indictment,&quot;We don't believe that Mr. Trigg did anything inappropriateor engaged in any conduct that resulted in any loss forFamily Savings andamp; Loan.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
