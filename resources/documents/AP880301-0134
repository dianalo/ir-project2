Thank you all very much, and good morning.   I'm going to Europe to meet with a group of friends andcolleagues, the leaders of the North Atlantic Alliance.   We and our foreign affairs and defense ministers see a good dealof each other, just as friends should.   But the meeting that begins in Brussels tomorrow will be special.   It will be the first time in almost six years that leaders ofall the NATO countries have met together for a summit.   Much has happened in those six years that we can be very proudof, including the INF Treaty with the Soviet Union that removes anentire class of U.S. and Soviet nuclear weapons, weapons that onthe Soviet side have held the European continent at risk.   That historic agreement was possible because the alliance'ssteadfast political and military resolve backed up our negotiationswith the Soviets.   But the purpose of this summit is not self-congratulations.   Our responsibility is to the future, and it will be to thefuture that we turn our attention tomorrow.   Our first priority is to maintain a strong and healthypartnership between North America and Europe, for this is thefoundation on which the cause of freedom so crucially depends.   We will never sacrifice the interests of this partnership in anyagreement with the Soviet Union.   NATO's agenda for peace and freedom has always been ambitious,and it must remain so.   In the arms control area, we will continue to press for Sovietagreement to 50 percent reductions in the strategic nuclear forceson both sides, and for a truly global and verifiable ban onchemical weapons.   My colleagues and I will be working to give negotiations onconventional forces a new start as well.   We will also discuss Soviet behavior toward its own citizens andtoward other countries, since problems of human rights and externalaggression remain key obstacles to long-term improvement ofEast-West relations.   If our common approach to the East over the years has givencoherence to our message of peace and world freedom, it has beenour unwavering commitment to defend ourselves that has given itcredibility.   Arms reduction can only succeed if it is backed up by a strongdefense.   My Atlantic colleagues and I will rededicate ourselves tomaintaining the deterrent that has protected our freedom andprosperity for almost 40 years.   I will repeat to my colleagues my strong conviction thatAmerican troops will remain in Europe, under any administration, solong as Europeans want them to stay.   We can be rightfully proud of these 40 years of peace that ourcommon commitment has brought.   But the job is not finished.   We in the alliance will not be satisfied merely with a recordperiod without war.   We seek nothing less than permanent peace with freedom in theNorth Atlantic.   This bold objective can be obtained, but we must have thecourage to follow the course that we have set for ourselves.   For four decades, a combination of a strong common defense andpursuit of dialogue with the East has been a winning formula forNATO.   It is a combination that can lead us to a future of peace,freedom and prosperity for generations to come.   Thank you. God bless you. And thank you all for coming out hereto see us off.</TEXT><HEAD>End Reagan-NATO Text _ 1 Take</HEAD></DOC>
