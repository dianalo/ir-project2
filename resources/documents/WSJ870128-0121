And they will be very difficult to quantify. In the short run, on the other hand, the economic effects of the tax-law changes are clear-cut.    Economists have chronicled many of the likely depressing effects on consumer spending, business investment and already-soft sectors of the economy, but the real sleeper in the new tax law is the squeeze it will put on wages and salaries. Individuals are scheduled to receive a total of $120 billion in tax cuts over the next five years, but few may actually see any net increase in purchasing power.    These individual tax-rate cuts are financed by an equal increase in corporate taxes, but it is clear that in the long run the business sector passes on all costs, and higher taxes are no exception. How can it be done this time, when few American businesses can raise prices in an era of devastating competition at home and abroad? By cutting costs. The incentive to do so is built right into the new tax law.    Last year, the top corporate tax rate was 46%, which meant a $100,000-a-year executive cost the corporate employer $54,000 after taxes -- and after-tax earnings are what corporate America is interested in. In 1988, however, the top corporate rate will fall to 34%, so the cost of that $100,000 executive will rise to $66,000. All tax-deductible costs will rise 22%; and for business meals and entertainment, the rise will be 35%, since the deductibility will be limited to 80% (unless there is a speaker, such as an economic consultant!).    American business is already zealous about cutting costs to meet global competition, and top corporate officers say these enormous increases in after-tax costs will only redouble the incentive. The pressure will intensify to reduce the costs of labor, travel and entertainment, to lean on suppliers, and to move production to cheaper areas here and abroad.    One financial-service company on the West Coast has cut its budget for convention attendance in half this year and is considering further cuts for 1988. Another firm, a Midwest maker of durable goods, now pays only per-diem travel expenses for middle managers, having discontinued full reimbursement of expenses.    A large East Coast insurance firm has limited geographic transfer to absolutely essential cases to cut moving expenses. A Midwest maker of capital goods made it clear to its U.S. suppliers that it will pay no more than a 10% premium over the prices of comparable materials from Taiwan, down from a 20% premium last year. Another capital-goods producer has as a result of the tax bill given up on U.S. suppliers and moved complete production lines to South Korea.    Finally, even more U.S. companies are linking parts of white- and blue-collar pay to corporate earnings through profit-sharing and other plans. In the process, their overall wage bill is being reduced.    Regardless of how costs are cut, however, it all boils down to a reduction in compensation for American employees. We can expect more pay cuts and two-tier wage systems in which new employees earn considerably less for performing exactly the same jobs as existing people do. We may see widespread use of the Japanese system in which older employees retire &quot;voluntarily&quot; and then come back as consultants with lower pay and no fringe benefits, but perform the same jobs -- a fancy way of cutting compensation.    Benefits cuts are expected to be almost universal, since that usually hurts less than cuts in take-home pay. Already, co-insurance on medical plans is replacing 100% company-paid plans in many firms to reduce both corporate costs per illness and the unnecessary use of medical services -- what I call &quot;recreational medicine.&quot;    Furthermore, in the case of all employees -- but especially those in the top tax bracket -- a corporate employer can cut gross pay and the company's costs considerably but still leave them with the same net income. For example, last year an executive in the 50% tax bracket retained $5,000 after tax from a $10,000 bonus that cost the corporation in the 46% bracket $5,400 after tax. In 1988, that executive will be in the 28% bracket, so that a bonus of $6,944 will net him the same $5,000 even though it will be 31% less than the old pre-tax bonus. And, with the corporation then paying 34% in federal taxes, the after-tax cost will drop 15%, to $4,583.    With these short-term aspects of the new tax laws discouraging for consumers and business, the law's timing couldn't be worse for the economy, since in 1987 the economy is already recession-prone. The consumer has been the only source of growth in the past two years. In fact, in the past eight quarters, consumer spending, which equals two-thirds of gross national product, accounted for 109% of its growth. Other sectors fell, on balance, 1.3%. And consumer incomes are not growing nearly as fast, so individuals are able to provide that spending growth only by borrowing to finance life styles they no longer can afford, but don't want to give up. Nevertheless, eventually consumers must face reality, and that may happen this year. When they do reduce their spending, a recession will unfold quickly.    If the tax-law changes are blamed for any 1987 recession, this could well discredit their basic goal -- longer-run neutrality of the tax system. Congress might jump back in to &quot;help&quot; various sectors through tax incentives. We could be back in the old rut before the new code got a fair road test.    ---   Mr. Shilling, an economic consultant, recently published &quot;The World Has Definitely Changed&quot; (Lakeview Press). </TEXT></DOC>
