Environmentalists, also testifying at the hearing, said in anews conference Tuesday that looser fuel-economy standards wouldcontribute to environmental damage, including a warming of theglobal climate.   The hearing by the National Highway Traffic SafetyAdministration was taking public comment on a proposal to set thecorporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, standard at 26.5 miles pergallon to 27.5 mpg.   Without the new rule, the standard would revert to the 27.5 mpgvoted by Congress in 1975. It has been set at 26 mpg since 1986under an exception allowed by NHTSA.   The fuel-economy law, adopted to reduce imported petroleumconsumption at a time of rapidly rising prices, sets a maximumlevel of fuel consumption each automaker's fleet of passenger cars,on average, must meet.   GM's customers choose cars in part based on gasoline prices, andwith the price at the pump running below $1 per gallon in much ofthe nation, car buyers see little value in features that save fuel,Klimisch said.   Should the standard be placed at 27.5 mpg, GM would be forced tocut back on large-car production at its Arlington, Texas, plant ata cost of 60,000 jobs to GM and its suppliers in 1989 and 110,000jobs in 1990, Klimisch said.   Car buyers, faced with a shortage of higher-powered GM cars,would buy from foreign automakers, buy light trucks that come underdifferent standards or drive older, less fuel-efficient carslonger, Klimisch said.   Eventually, GM might be forced to increase the percentage offoreign-made parts in its cars to meet the demands of themarketplace, he said.   The automaker estimates it might be able to meet a standard ofabout 27.1 mpg without job losses, but to make sure of that, inlight of the uncertainties of sales forecasts and test results, itneeds a standard of 26.7 mpg or less, he said.   A coalition of 20 environmental groups called for stiffening ofthe standards to avoid contributing to global warming.   ``If you liked this summer's heat and droughts, you'll love theresults of this policy,'' said Thomas B. Stoel Jr., internationalprogram director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ``Inview of what the scientists are telling us about global warming, itis hard to imagine a more irresponsible proposal.''   Researchers have predicted that manmade emissions of carbondioxide in the atmosphere will raise the average global temperaturesignificantly during the next century, causing changes in weatherpatterns, crop growth and increased sea levels from polar melting.   Carbon dioxide tends to trap heat in the atmosphere rather thanallowing it to radiate back into space, a phenomenon called the``greenhouse effect.''   Automobiles account for about 25 percent of U.S. emissions ofcarbon dioxide, Stoel said.   ``If the U.S. auto fleet could be brought up to an average of 45mpg by the year 2005, this one action would reduce U.S. carbondioxide emissions by about 15 percent,'' he said.   Loosening the standard from 27.5 mpg to 26 mpg would increasecarbon dioxide emissions over the estimated 106,000-mile life ofeach affected car by about 1.6 tons or 4 percent, according tofigures presented by Energy Conservation Coalition.</TEXT></DOC>
