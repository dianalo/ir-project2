 This year there's a formidable newchallenger, ChipSoft Inc.'s Turbo Tax, the Mac version of the best-sellingtax software ever.andM;The primary advantages of these programs are their Internal RevenueService-accepted printouts and the ease that computer calculation can bringto tax preparation.andP;  Prospective buyers should know that, although thesepackages are sold year-round, federal and some state governments don'tapprove all their own forms until January of each year.andP;  Tax programs aretypically updated each February to incorporate any changes.andP;  We reviewed the1990 versions of these three programs, but the final versions of the 1990 taxforms were not available in some cases.andM;Turbo graphics?andP;  When you first open the TurboTax package and find you areviewing a worksheet and not a tax form, you may think you've detectedTurboTax's DOS roots.andP;  This initial worksheet holds the personal informationusually filled in at the top of the 1040 form.andP;  It also has fields for yourestimated tax payments and retirement plans.andP;  Once this data is earned, youselect which tax form to view on-screen.andM;From this point on, TurboTax is similar to MacInTax: You see a goodrepresentation of a tax form on-screen and fill it out directly.andP;  Thesoftware does all the work it can for you, copying information from one formto another and performing calculations.andP;  However, TurboTax feels differentfrom MacInTax.andM;With MacInTax, the software is transparent, giving the not-quite-accurateimpression that there is nothing more to the program than forms.andP;  InTurboTax, you also get information and advice about taxes broken down intomore than 20 categories.andP;  For example, the Info and Assistance menus displaythe IRS' instruction booklet, national averages for deductions (to help youto see which of yours are likely to generate an audit), tax-law changes, acalendar, a final tax checklist and Turbo News (a clever alternative to theubiquitous Read Me file in which last-minute changes are noted).andP;  Theinformation in the manuals also is very good.andM;For beginners, there is a series of questions to help them decide which formsthey need.andP;  Advanced users will appreciate the Forms Diagram, a chart showingthe flow of information between the current form and others.andM;A cross-reference window shows the origin of computer entries (usually a lineon another form) and gives the option of overriding them -- a featureavailable only in the professional version of MacInTax.andP;  Surprisingly,TurboTax never shows cents; it always rounds to the nearest dollar.andP;  Weprefer the option of turning this feature on or off, which MacInTax offers.andM;Individual lines on forms can have either notes or supporting statementsattached to them.andP;  The notes are reminders to the user; supporting statementscan be printed out and filed with the return.andP;  Unlike in MacInTax, supportingstatements cannot be several levels deep.andP;  TurboTax's tax-planning modecalculates next year's taxes based on this year's data.andP;  The resultingfigures can be adjusted for inflation and personal growth, and variousscenarios can be compared side by side.andP;  This makes &quot;what-if' planning abreeze.andM;While our overall impression of TurboTax is favorable, we have two majorconcerns.andP;  First, no state forms have been released yet, although 11 areplanned (see table, Page 56).andP;  Second, every printed or on-screen form in thecurrent package is marked &quot;Do Not File With the IRS.&quot;andM;ChipSoft intends to release the final, approved version of TurboTax soon, butwe remember how late Softview was the first couple of years and worry thatChipSoft could suffer the same problem.andP;  The early 1990 release of MacInTaxwe reviewed has only a small set of forms available, but these are approvedfor submission to the IRS, and some of MacInTax's final state forms arealready out.andM;ChipSoft wrote custom printing routines in an effort to increase speed, butwe believe this causes unnecessary confusion.andP;  TurboTax also produces theweakest forms of the three packages we reviewed.andP;  Still, we feel confidentthat ChipSoft's forms are good enough to get IRS approval.andM;ChipSoft still has not decided if it will include the capability to fileelectronically in TurboTax's final release.andP;  TurboTax can import data fromtext files or from last year's MacInTax files.andP;  In fact, TurboTax importsMacInTax 1989 information faster than MacInTax 1990 does.andP;  There also is atax trivia game included, which might prove diverting during a taxing nightin front of the Mac.andM;Resting on their laurels?andP;  The 1990 version of MacInTax is similar to pastiterations, but the list of add-on products has grown.andP;  There are 13state-tax forms scheduled for release this year and the professional 1040package has been joined by a professional state package for California; bothcan be used with form sets for partnerships, corporations and S-corporations.andM;Softview also has added some help for the bewildered.andP;  The program has aForms Guide with 40 questions about taxes in plain English.andP;  Double-clickingon any question opens the relevant form.andP;  The package also contains a mapthat charts relationships between forms.andM;The quality of MacInTax's on-screen forms is excellent, but our favoritefeature is the itemization windows.andP;  Double-clicking on any line on any formopens the relevant worksheet or a generic window where you can enter notesand lists of numbers with identifying titles.andP;  The amounts are addedautomatically and placed in the field on the tax form.andP;  These itemizationscan be printed out as supporting statements to be filed with the return, orthey can be kept in your personal records.andP;  Each line in an itemizationwindow can be generated from another such window, and so on.andM;Softview was the first company to win IRS approval for a 1040 printed out ona dot-matrix printer.andP;  MacInTax's forms, both on-screen and off the printer,are the best we've seen in any personal computer-based tax package.andM;MacInTax offers several importing options, including the ability to importnumbers from annual reports in personal financial-management packages, suchas Quicken, MacMoney and Managing Your Money.andP;  MacInTax imports plain-textfiles as well, and it can transfer data from last year's forms to this year'sand from federal forms to state.andP;  This is a timesaver that significantly cutsdown on errors.andM;For those lucky enough to be anticipating a refund from the IRS, Softviewoffers electronic-filing facilities that may get you your money in as few asfive ays.andP;  Instructions for electronic filing are in the manual, and MacInTaxcan print out the necessary paperwork.andP;  (Yes, some paperwork is required forelectronic filing.)andM;The manual is the best yet from Softview.andP;  It is spiral-bound and full ofuseful, well-indexed information.andP;  However, in keeping with the company'spolicy, there is no tax advice at all.andP;  The on-screen help consists ofinformation from the IRS instruction booklet.andP;  Technical support is availableon-line or by phone, with extended hours during tax season.andP;  ChipSoftlikewise offers extended support during this period.andM;Bargain basement.andP;  Long a favorite with spreadsheet jockeys, Heizer's TaxSeries of spreadsheet templates has both the lowest price and the longestlist of supported forms.andP;  An Extra Forms and Depreciation worksheet isavailable, along with an Individual Tax Planner, which allows multiple futurescenarios to be compared for up to four years.andP;  Heizer offers a full set ofbusiness forms and a professional version, which includes update macros fortax prepares with annual clients.andM;All forms are offered in several varieties: a set for Excel 2.2 and anotherfor older versions, a set for PC Excel, and one for Microsoft Corp.'s Workson the Mac.andP;  The Excel 2.2 forms look slightly better than the otherson-screen and on paper.andM;This 2.2 version sports a new menu full of macros to help manage the forms.andO;One macro allows you to select the forms to open on start-up, which can getpeople with complex returns in trouble.andP;  In our tests, we experienced &quot;out ofmemory&quot; errors when using a large number of associated forms.andP;  The companyknows about the problem, and the manual advises using a utility to change themaximum number of open files allowed by the Mac operting system, but that'sonly a partial solution.andM;The on-line help available in the Excel 2.2 version is rather modest, and themanual is absolutely minimal.andP;  Users are expected to be experienced at bothfilling out their tax returns and using Excel.andP;  Printing is the mostdifficult part of using the Heizer Tax Series.andP;  We found we had to previeweach page and sometimes reduce it to get forms to fit on standard papersizes.andP;  The quality of the printed forms is good, and they can be signed andsent in to the IRS.andM;Conclusions.andP;  Everybody has to do taxes, and this year Mac users have threegood packages to choose from.andP;  Those with straight-forward tax needs and alot of questions will be well-served by the abundant hand-holding and taxadvice found in ChipSoft's Turbo Tax, but they should make sure that thefinal IRS forms are available before buying.andM;People who get their advice elesewhere or who want the highest-quality formsand supporting worksheets should opt for MacInTax.andP;  Anyone who's been usingSoftview's product should stick with it;  ChipSoft isn't offering anycompelling reasons to switch.andM;Spreadsheet jockeys and those wishing to spend as little as possible on theirtaxes will find a good value in Heizer's Tax Series.andP;  Although some annoyingproblems keep the templates from being as easy to use as the stand-aloneapplications, the individual 1040 works as expected, and the roster ofadd-ons is impressive and affordable.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
