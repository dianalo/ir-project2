We need only expand to {Sigma}/sup2/ when the running coupling is effectively constant over a large enoughmomentum range. Renormalization group arguments applied to the kernelof the resulting Schwinger-Dyson equation allow us to deduce propertiesof {Sigma}(p), and in particular we obtain {Sigma}(M) where M is an ultravioletcutoff. This is useful for demonstrating the enhancement of technifermioncondensates and the suppression of flavor-changing neutral currents intechnicolor theories.</TEXT></DOC>
