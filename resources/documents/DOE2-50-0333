Both ends of a large number of tie-lines have beendetermined using both an electron microprobe and a scanning electronmicroscope with energy dispersive X-ray analysis equipment. The isothermalsections at 1223, 1273, 1373, and 1473 K have been constructed from theexperimental data and thermodynamic model calculations. The Gibbs energyof the intermetallic phases has been described with a recently developedmodel for phases with several sublattices. The parameter values describingthe Gibbs energy of each individual phase were determined with a computerizedoptimization technique. The calculated phase diagrams are in satisfactoryagreement with the experimental information and allow reasonable extrapolationoutside the experimental temperature range.</TEXT></DOC>
