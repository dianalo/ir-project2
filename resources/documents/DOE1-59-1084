These countries have experienceda pronounced shift within industry away from the processing of basicmaterials toward the production of increasingly refined and complex goods.If this recent trend persists, it has far-reaching implications. To determinewhether this recent experience signals a structural shift in the economyor is merely a fluctuation relative to a better established long-termtrend, it is necessary to understand the factors that underlie it. Thispaper reviews recent analyses of ongoing trends away from the materials-intensiveindustries, and presents the authors' own analysis of the trends andthe future outlook for basic materials, and an assessment of the implicationsfor future industrial energy use in the United States. In carrying outtheir assessment, the authors have focused on trends in materials consumptionand production measured in physical terms (kilograms) instead of moreconventional dollar measures (value-added or sales data), for two reasons.First, in many instances economic output statistics are not disaggregatedenough to reveal the extents of shifts to higher-value products. Second,since their ultimate interest is in the implications of shifting patternsof production on industrial energy demand, it is better to track kilograms,because energy requirements for production are closely tied to physicalmeasures of production, but not necessarily to dollar measures.</TEXT></DOC>
