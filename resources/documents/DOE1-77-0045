<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-77-0045 </DOCNO><TEXT>A brief review of Brillouin scattering is made emphasizing its advantagesand disadvantages over conventional ultrasonic techniques. One of itsadvantages is that the elastic properties of very thin films ({similar_to}1{mu}) can be investigated. The authors have used this technique to studychanges in shear elastic constants of materials irradiated with highenergy ions. These particles only penetrate {similar_to} 1{mu} into thematerial but produce very high defect concentrations which, in certaincases, can lead to amorphization. In Nb{sub 3}Ir and Zr{sub 3}Al verylarge changes are observed before the onset of amorphization, while inSi the changes occur concomitantly with amorphization. The significanceof the hardening observed in Zr{sub 3}Al when it becomes amorphous willbe discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
