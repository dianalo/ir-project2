The groups, led by the Natural Resources Defense Council,released a letter to Energy Secretary John S. Herrington urgingpreparation of a ``programmatic environmental impact statement'' onthe entire complex, which involves 17 facilities employing some100,000 people in 12 states.   ``It is time to take the wraps off what has been in effect theDepartment of Energy's `stealth' program and to compel meaningfulpublic scrutiny of its plans for the complex,'' said Dan W. Reicher,an attorney for the council.   Another attorney for the Washington-based group, Jacob Scherr,told a news conference that ``we have seen a pattern ofmismanagement, excessive secrecy, deceit, illegality and neglect.''   He asserted that ``at the heart of this crisis lies a growinglack of public trust in our nation's nuclear weapons builders.Fundamental questions are being raised _ and rightly so _ about thecapabilities and credibility of the Department of Energy to manage,oversee and ensure the safety of this vast enterprise.''   A DOE spokeswoman, Christina Sankey, said the department had noimmediate comment because officials had not yet seen the letter.   The move came one day after the NRDC and two other groups filedsuit to compel the Energy Department to prepare an environmentalimpact statement on its sprawling Savannah River plant in SouthCarolina, before any of the three weapons reactors there can berestarted.   Savannah River is the only DOE facility capable of producingtritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen vital to boosting theexplosive yield of nuclear warheads. Because tritium decays at arate of 5.5 percent a year, it needs to be replenished regularly.   The head of an Energy Department advisory committee saidWednesday that the panel is not supporting DOE's plan to restart oneof the reactors _ called the K reactor _ at Savannah River becauseof continuing safety concerns. The restart is tentatively scheduledfor next summer.   John F. Ahearne, chairman of the Advisory Committee on NuclearFacilities Safety, said the panel's position is stated in a letterexpected to be sent to Herrington later this week.   ``The overall gist of the letter ... is that we're essentiallydeclining to endorse the restart strategy. ... We think it isinsufficient to be used as the basis to go ahead and restart,''Ahearne said in an interview.   Problems identified by the advisory panel, he said, include theDOE plan's failure to include ultrasonic testing for potentiallydangerous reactor piping cracks and insufficient attention tobolstering the Savannah River reactors so they can better withstandearthquakes.   In both instances the citizen groups demanding action by DOEinvoked the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act, which requiresenvironmental impact statements for any ``major federal actionsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment.''   Several members of Congress, in a separate letter to Herrington,endorsed the call for a programmatic environmental study of theweapons complex. They included Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., andTimothy E. Wirth, D-Colo., along with Reps. Les AuCoin, D-Ore.;Albert Bustamante, D-Texas; Mike Synar, D-Okla.; Ron Wyden, D-Ore.;Bill Green, R-N.Y., and Claudine Schneider, R-R.I.   The citizen groups, in their letter to Herrington, noted that``the nuclear warhead production complex is at a major crossroads inits 40-year history.''   Activities planned by DOE include ``construction of a variety ofnew production facilities, major renovations across the complex,decommissioning and decontamination of scores of facilities, andcleanup of hundreds of waste sites,'' the letter said.   It cited press reports that a classified DOE study expected to besent shortly to Congress will propose spending $50 billion over thenext 20 years for various renovation and upgrade programs.   In addition to the Natural Resources Defense Council, othergroups joining in the letter were:   Citizen Alert, Citizens Against Rocky Flats Contamination, EnergyResearch Foundation, Environmental Action, Environmental PolicyInstitute, Government Accountability Project, Greenpeace, HanfordEducation Action League, National Taxpayers Union, NorthwestEnvironmental Advocates, Northwest Nuclear Safety Campaign,Palouse-Clearwater Hanford Watch, Physicians for SocialResponsibility, Puget Sound SANE, Sierra Club, Snake River Allianceand Washington Physicians for Social Responsibility.</TEXT></DOC>
