This Notice supersedes a previously publishednotice (53 FR 6036), clarifying that the value of food stamps currentlyqualifies for the income exclusion, whether provided in the form of couponsor in some other form, such as cash. Additionally, this notice updatesthe exclusion of Federally funded scholarships to reflect the changes madeby the Higher Education Technical Amendments Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-50,101 Stat. 335, 353, section 14(27)). That Act simplifies the determinationof the amount of assistance attributable to attendance costs and, therefore,the amount that is excludable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> September 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORAMTION CONTACT:</T2> For Rent Supplement, section236, and section 8 programs administered under 24 CFR parts 880, 881, and883 through 886: James J. Tahash, Director, Program Planning Division,Office of Multifamily Management, Department of Housing Urban Development,451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410, telephone (202) 426-3944.For section 8 programs administered under 24 CFR part 882 (Existing Housing,Moderate Rehabilitation) and under part 887 (Vounchers), and for the Publicand Indian Housing programs: Edward Whipple, Chief, Rental and OccupancyBranch, Office of Public and Indian Housing, Department of Housing andUrban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410, telephone(202) 426-0744.

Instead, HUD publishes a notice in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> to inform the public of the benefits that qualifyfor the exclusion. See the notices published on September 9, 1987 (52 FR34116) and on February 29, 1988 (53 FR 6036).The list of program benefits published in the February 29, 1988 noticeincluded ``the value of the allotment provided to an eligible householdfor coupons under the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2017(b)).'' TheFood Stamp Act itself does not refer to coupons. It provides that ``thevalue of the allotment provided any eligible household shall not be consideredincome or resources for any purpose under any Federal, State, or locallaws, including, but not limited to, laws relating to taxation, welfare,and public assistance programs, and no participating State or politicalsubdivision thereof shall decrease any assistance otherwise provided anindividual or individuals because of the receipt of an allotment underthis chapter.''It has come to our attention that several states are experimenting withproviding Food Stamp allotments in cash. The language of our previous noticewould appear not to exclude this form of Food Stamp assistance, althoughthe Food Stamp Act would require its exclusion. Consequently, this noticerevises the exclusion for food stamp assistance (paragraph (ii)) to eliminateany reference to the form in which it is provided.An exclusion for scholarships has been included in HUD regulations as amatter of policy before the exclusion became mandated in 1986 with respectto certain Federally funded scholarships. Since 1975, the Department'sregulations governing the public housing and Section 8 programs have excludedfrom income scholarship assistance provided ``for <T3>use</T3> in meeting the costs of tuition, fees, books, and equipment.''(Emphasis added.) Under this language PHAs and other assisted housing programadministrators attempted to determine how much of a particular grant wasactually used to meet attendance costs, and excludable, and how much wasactually used for room and board and similar expenses, and therefore notexcludable from income.The most recent Notice which was applicable to the public and Indian housing,section 8, section 236 and Rent Supplement programs, implemented the 1986statutory exclusion for scholarships funded under title IV of the HigherEducation Act of 1965, using similar language. Title IV is the principlesource of Federal funding for higher education. It includes funding forscholarships, including basic education opportunity grants, supplementaleducation opportunity grants, and special programs for students from disadvantagedbackgrounds, and for work-study programs and for Bureau of Indian Affairsstudent assistance programs.In 1987, Congress amended section 479B of the Higher Education Act of 1965,codified at 20 U.S.C. 1087uu, to provide that student financial assistancefurnished under Title IV of that statute or under Bureau of Indian Affairsstudent assistance programs ``that is <T3>made available </T3>for attendance costs shall not be considered asincome or resources in determining eligibility for assistance under anyother program funded in whole or in part with Federal funds.'' (Emphasisadded.) Under the revised statutory language, a housing administrator mustexclude the portion of assistance that is intended by the educational institutionto cover attendance costs. It is not authorized to trace the actual useof funds and limit the exclusion to the amount actually expended for attendancecosts. This notice revises the title IV scholarship exclusion in paragraph(x) under the list of program benefits that are excluded from income, toreflect the statutory language change that simplifies the determinationof the amount of scholarship assistance to exclude.Under the revised language, assisted housing administrators should seekinformation from the educational institution concerning the purpose ofa particular grant to determine what portion is made available for attendancecosts and what portion is made available for other expenses. Where thepurpose of the grant is unspecified, assisted housing administrators willhave the discretion to adopt any reasonable method of allocating the grantbetween attendance costs and other expenses, such as room and board, solong as the method adopted will not produce a result contrary to section479B. That section does not authorize the administrator to investigatehow the student actually spends the assistance.Neither of these changes in the list of income exclusions require a changein the information collection requirements (which are subject to reviewby the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Actof 1980) contained in the referenced regulations. Information about scholarshipswas routinely sought from educational institutions under the exclusionas contained in the previous notice. If a particular housing administratorexperiences any change in information collection burden, it will be a reductionin burden (for those who may have sought information from students aboutactual expenses).The following list of program benefits is the comprehensive list of benefitsthat currently qualify for the income exclusion stated in 24 CFR 215.21(c)(10),236.3(c)(10), 813.106(c)(10) and 913.106(c)(10):(i) Relocation payments made pursuant to Title II of the Uniform RelocationAssistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C.4636);(ii) The value of the allotment provided to an eligible household underthe Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2017(b));(iii) Payments to volunteers under the Domestic Volunteer Services Actof 1973 (42 U.S.C. 1626(a));(iv) Payments received under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43U.S.C. 1626(a));(v) Income derived from certain submarginal land of the United States thatis held in trust for certain Indian tribes (25 U.S.C. 459e);(vi) Payments or allowances made under the Department of Health and HumanServices' Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (42 U.S.C. 8624(f));(vii) Payments received under programs funded in whole or in part underthe Job Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C. 1552(b));(viii) Income derived from the disposition of funds of the Grand RiverBand of Ottawa Indians (Pub.
