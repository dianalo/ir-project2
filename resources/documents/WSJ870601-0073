Wright, National Broadcasting Co. president, is prowling for major acquisitions and joint ventures, broadcasting and company executives said.    Mr. Wright is so hungry for deals that he has even considered spinning off a minority interest in the NBC television network or finding a minority joint-venture partner for the network, the sources said, declining to disclose details.    Mr. Wright acknowledged in an interview that he has &quot;looked at&quot; the idea of a network spinoff or joint venture but that he &quot;decided that it was inappropriate at this juncture.&quot; Nonetheless, associates said, such ideas reflect Mr. Wright's willingness to examine wide alternatives in building NBC, a General Electric Co. unit, including some options that traditional broadcasters might never contemplate.    Associates also said Mr. Wright sees acquisitions and joint ventures as the way to leave his mark on NBC in light of the success of his predecessor, Grant A. Tinker, in taking the network from third to first place in the ratings.    &quot;If you look at (Mr. Wright's) record, that's where he made his reputation,&quot; one NBC associate said. &quot;His reputation has been as a deal maker.&quot;    Mr. Wright ran GE's financial services division before being named last August to succeed Mr. Tinker. Before joining NBC, Mr. Wright engineered GE's acquisition of an 80% stake in Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. Inc. last year for $600 million, among other transactions.    High on Mr. Wright's acquisition list are major-market TV stations. Including NBC's five owned and operated stations, GE currently owns six TV stations reaching about 21% of the nation's 87.4 million homes with TV sets. But under federal rules, GE could own as many as 12 stations reaching 25% of TV homes. GE has about $2.4 billion in cash and securities on hand that could be spent on acquisitions.    In January, NBC and GE agreed to acquire a Miami, Fla., affiliate station, WTVJ-TV, for $270 million from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., a New York investment concern.    Mr. Wright acknowledged reports he also explored acquiring stations owned by Taft Broadcasting Co., Cincinnati, and other stations owned by Kohlberg Kravis. Taft Broadcasting is instead being acquired by a group led by Cincinnati investor Carl Lindner, while Kohlberg Kravis is negotiating to sell a 51% stake in its stations to Gillett Holdings Inc., Nashville, Tenn., for more than $600 million.    Mr. Wright also disclosed he sought unsuccessfully to participate in the pending sale of a 37% stake in Turner Broadcasting System Inc., Atlanta, to a group of cable companies for $576.4 million. In 1985, NBC tried to acquire a stake in Turner Broadcasting's Cable News Network, but talks collapsed over editorial control issues.    &quot;I have more than a passing interest&quot; in cable TV programming, said Mr. Wright, who ran a cable company for nearly four years between jobs at GE. He also said he hopes to expand the company's home video operations.    In joint ventures, talks between NBC and Westinghouse Electric Corp. about merging the companies' radio operations into a new concern recently stalled when federal regulators began reviewing radio station ownership rules.    As for a sale or joint venture involving part of the NBC network -- which is primarily a programming service for NBC's own stations and 200 affiliates -- Mr. Wright said it isn't &quot;clear that there's a clear benefit&quot; to NBC for doing so at present. But he didn't rule out considering the idea in the future.    He declined to disclose his motives for such a move, but hinted that it might involve the sale of part of the network to NBC affiliates, by noting that cable system operators commonly have ownership in cable programming operations. He declined to comment further. NBC will have operating profit of more than $500 million this year, including about $300 million in network operating profit, analysts said.    &quot;They're looking at everything,&quot; one NBC veteran said of the network idea and other possible moves.    Separately, NBC sources said the network is considering some changes in its news division operations that may include management shifts. NBC News has been under study for several months by news executives and McKinsey andamp; Co. consultants. &quot;There's been a lot of discussion, a lot of rumors and a lot of nonsense, and there is nothing to talk about&quot; at present, NBC News President Lawrence K. Grossman said. </TEXT></DOC>
