The dimensions of the lead plates are 20 x 60 cm/sup 2/and their thickness 6 mm. A scintillator layer consists of 12 strips,20 x 5 cm/sup 2/ and 2.5 mm thick. Each strip is read out using wavelengthshifting plates at both sides. The mechanical stability of the moduleis provided by tie-rods and spacers. We have tested it in a 1 to 5 GeVelectron beam. The influence of rods and spacers of various shapes andsizes on the uniformity of response and energy resolution is investigated.</TEXT></DOC>
