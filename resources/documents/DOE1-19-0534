<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-19-0534 </DOCNO><TEXT>An ultra high speed data transmission system using optical fibers andgallium arsenide digital integrated circuits has been investigated. Thesystem is designed to meet the increased data rate requirements of moderninformation processing systems as well as those of future imaging devicesand high spatial resolution detectors. A description of the system whichuses available components made for the transmission and reception ofdata at 780 Mbit/s rates is given. Methods for digitizing, multiplexing,demultiplexing, error checking, etc., are also described, and a discussionof the reliability of components is presented. 15 refs.; 9 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
