But prospects are dim for the legislation, approved on a56-42 vote, that would overhaul the campaign finance system.President Bush has vowed to veto the bill. And the House,which has been reluctant to make sweeping changes in thecampaign finance system, has yet to take action on thepolitically sticky issue.</LP><TEXT>   For the past five years, Congress has been deadlocked onhow to deal with perceived abuses in campaign funding andcongressional ethics. Democrats have long demanded spendinglimits and more recently sought public subsidies, but bothare anathema to the GOP and President Bush. Republicanspushed for the abolition of political action committees.   Sen. David Boren (D., Okla.), the bill's chief sponsor,said its voluntary spending limits and subsidies will end&quot;the money chase.&quot; While the bill includes a PAC ban, Sen.Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who led the opposition, blastedthe legislation as a program of &quot;food stamps forpoliticians.&quot; Democrats have estimated that the bill wouldcost taxpayers about $50 million each election cycle.   The bill imposes voluntary state-by-state spendingceilings for Senate candidates, ranging from $950,000 to $5.5million, based on each state's voting age population. As anincentive to candidates who comply with the limits, the billprovides government funded vouchers for broadcasting andlow-cost mailing rates.   The legislation also requires broadcasters to offercongressional candidates 50% discounts to air television andradio ads. James May, executive vice president of theNational Association of Broadcasters, which sharply opposesthe measure, said it would have &quot;a serious impact on stationfinances.&quot;   Among its other provisions, the legislation would restrictto $25,000 the amount candidates can loan or give theircampaigns, abolish the speaking fees senators receive fromspecial interest groups, and shut down the &quot;soft money&quot;system where wealthy individuals funnel large contributionsto the two political parties beyond the limits of the federalelection laws.   During three days of partisan sparring, the Democrats beatback a slew of Republican amendments, including measures thatwould have dismantled the public funding of presidentialelections and imposed a two-term limitation on Senatecandidates receiving public funds.   Fred Wertheimer of Common Cause, a leading proponent ofcampaign finance overhaul, said that &quot;we are encouraged thisyear that there is a real chance for passing real reform.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
