The indictment widens the government's case involving the PaineWebber branch at 1221 Avenue of the Americas. Last month Gary Eder, who worked out of the same office, pleaded guilty to related charges and began cooperating with the government's investigation. Mr. Eder at one time was PaineWebber's top-producing broker.    Indicted yesterday was branch manager Joseph P. Tota, 43 years old, and the branch's operations manager, 38-year-old George B. Fahmy. Each was charged with conspiracy and obstruction of justice for allegedly helping wealthy customers of the firm hide more than $700,000 in cash from the Internal Revenue Service. They also were charged with allegedly destroying records after the government began its investigation.    The indictment quotes Messrs. Tota and Fahmy as referring to one part of the scheme, the alleged miscoding of PaineWebber records to make cash deposits appear to be check deposits, as &quot;turning water into wine.&quot; Such treatment is one way to avoid having to file currency transaction reports to the IRS.    PaineWebber itself hasn't been charged with wrongdoing. The firm, a unit of PaineWebber Group Inc., released a short statement yesterday in which it said the two men have been suspended indefinitely. &quot;The firm has cooperated with the U.S. Attorney's office throughout the investigation and will continue to do so.&quot;    Frank Wright, an attorney for Mr. Tota, said his client will plead innocent at his arraignment next Thursday. &quot;He emphatically denies all the charges brought against him,&quot; Mr. Wright said. Mr. Tota became branch manager in June 1982.    Mr. Fahmy, operations manager since March 1984 under Mr. Tota, said yesterday that he &quot;would rebut these charges entirely&quot; and be proven innocent at trial.    Last month Mr. Eder, who resigned as a PaineWebber vice president in February, pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy and creation of false brokerage records. He is scheduled to be sentenced May 27, according to David Spears, the assistant U.S. attorney handling the case. Mr. Eder's attorneys say their client was only helping wealthy customers and that the case has nothing to do with insider trading or the possible laundering of illegal stock profits.    Yesterday's indictment alleges that Mr. Eder, with the &quot;approval and participation&quot; of Messrs. Tota and Fahmy, received payments of as much as $72,000 in cash at one time from PaineWebber customers, and broke them down into deposits of less than $10,000 in violation of federal tax and securities laws. The alleged schemes occurred as far back as January 1981 and continued through this year, the government charged.    If convicted, Messrs. Tota and Fahmy each face a maximum 10 years in prison and $500,000 in fines. </TEXT></DOC>
