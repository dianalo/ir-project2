Unless an appeals court quickly reverses it, the ruling could force Eastern to pay as much as $7 million a month to thousands of employees who will have little or no work to perform. Eastern yesterday filed an emergency appeal of the order.    The findings of federal Judge Barrington Parker also eventually could pose a threat to Eastern's parent, Houston-based Texas Air Corp., and its Continental Airlines subsidiary. In a 50-page opinion, the judge called several internal transactions at Texas Air &quot;questionable,&quot; &quot;shocking&quot; or &quot;suspect.&quot; He charged that the moves were calculated to hurt unionized Eastern while benefiting Continental, a nonunion carrier.    Despite running huge losses for some time, he said, &quot;Eastern has served as a lending institution to meet the needs of Texas Air and Continental.&quot;    The language is significant because, in a series of suits pending in Judge Parker's court, Eastern's unions are seeking to reverse the switch of several assets and operations from Eastern to Continental.    It wasn't clear exactly how many employees' jobs had been saved at least for the time being, because there was a contradiction between Judge Parker's opinion and a three-page order signed later in the day.    The opinion said the &quot;proposed furloughing of 4,000 employees is illegal.&quot; But that number includes about 1,500 nonunion management and clerical jobs not covered by the Railway Labor Act, which the judge's opinion invoked. The judge's later order identified only machinists, flight attendants and pilots -- all of whom are unionized -- as protected workers.    Eastern's president, Phil Bakes, assailed the no-layoffs order as &quot;gravely wrong&quot; and a threat to airline managements' freedom of action.    &quot;Eastern, like any American business, must be allowed to prune money-losing operations,&quot; he said. Unless reversed, he said, the ruling will &quot;profoundly disrupt the entire airline industry and the very essence of deregulation.&quot;    Twenty-two U.S. airlines made the same argument in an earlier friend-of-the-court brief, arguing that &quot;the choice of where and when it is going to fly is the most fundamental right of any airline's management.&quot;    However, Judge Parker specifically did not block Eastern's plan to slash its flight operations and to eliminate Kansas City as a flight hub. Those retrenchment moves, which are intended to help avoid $1.5 million a week in losses, are well within the rights of management, the judge said.    &quot;This is a brilliant decision,&quot; said James Linsey, a lawyer for Eastern's pilots union. &quot;It protects employees' and labor organizations' rights but doesn't disturb the legitimate business decisions of corporate America.&quot;    Had Judge Parker ordered Eastern to maintain those unprofitable operations -- and had Eastern failed to win a quick stay of that order -- the carrier might have been forced to seek Chapter 11 protection from creditors. Yesterday's decision would seem to avert that possibility, assuming that Eastern can maintain adequate cash reserves through the normally slow autumn travel season.    There was speculation that Judge Parker could throw Eastern into a liquidity crisis by blocking its sale of the 33 to 41 aircraft it will no longer need after the service cutbacks. Selling the aircraft could be essential for Eastern to meet its cash needs, particularly if it faces a strike by the machinists with whom it is engaged in bitter wage-concession talks.    But while permitting the service cutbacks, Judge Parker found the plan for 4,000 layoffs to be a violation of the Railway Labor Act. That law gives unions a major voice in certain management decisions, particularly when collective bargaining is in progress. And Eastern, since its 1986 acquisition by Texas Air, has been bargaining vigorously to obtain labor-cost concessions from the machinists and pilots.    The law also bars management from altering the &quot;status quo&quot; in the workplace in certain cases and from departing from &quot;past practice&quot; in others. Eastern presented evidence that it had furloughed more than 7,000 holders of machinist union jobs since 1974. But Judge Parker nevertheless found that the proposed elimination of 4,000 jobs at one time is not, &quot;and never shall be, business as usual.&quot;    Judge Parker's opinion depicted Eastern, as well as Texas Air and its chairman, Frank Lorenzo, as consumed with hatred toward the unions. &quot;By walking away from the bargaining table and unilaterally furloughing 4,000 employees, Eastern wants to show its employees that no union can stop it,&quot; he wrote. Elsewhere, he wrote that &quot;Texas Air has exerted every effort to curb union influence at Eastern.&quot;    Eastern yesterday had only begun to ponder the problem of what to do with its employees in Las Vegas, Nev., San Antonio, Texas, Minneapolis and 11 other locations where it is scheduled to suspend operations tomorrow.    &quot;Obviously, it makes no sense to have unproductive employees, but we've got to clarify exactly what we can and can't do,&quot; a spokesman for the Miami-based airline said.    Union leaders and lawyers called yesterday's decision the sweetest victory yet in their long battle with Texas Air over cost-cutting and asset-switching at Eastern. &quot;It brought out the conclusion that Mr. Lorenzo and company were not really trying to keep Eastern Airlines in business but to bust the company by selling its assets,&quot; said William Scheri, an official of the machinists union.    ---                 Texas Air's Turbulent Year                         Feb. 4, 1988   Texas Air reports record loss of $466.2 million for 1987, announces it will sell Eastern's Air Shuttle to new Texas Air unit.                           March 11   U.S. District Judge John Pratt finds Eastern in contempt and blocks shuttle sale, saying it violated earlier order requiring company to negotiate with unions before transferring operations.                           March 29   U.S. District Judge John Barrington Parker bars Eastern from using its planes to train strike-breaking pilots unless a strike has occurred.                           March 31   Eastern's unions sue Texas Air, accusing it of denuding Eastern of assets and driving away organized labor.                           April 13   Transportation Secretary James Burnley launches investigation into whether Texas Air is &quot;fit&quot; to run airlines and begins plane-by-plane safety inspection.                           April 21   Secretary Burnley assails Eastern pilots for peppering FAA with &quot;groundless&quot; safety complaints.                            May 9   Texas Air sues Eastern's pilots and machinists for $1.5 billion, charging them with conspiring to destroy Eastern.                            June 2   Transportation Department finds Texas Air &quot;fit&quot; and Eastern and Continental safe -- except to warn that labor strife poses potential safety threat at Eastern.                            June 7   Federal appeals court sets aside Judge Pratt's contempt finding and injunction against shuttle sale, remanding case for further hearings.                            July 4   Texas Air drops plan to switch shuttle ownership.                            July 22   Eastern announces 12% service cutbacks, elimination of Kansas City hub operations and reduction of 4,000 jobs.                            August 3   Judge Parker temporarily bars Eastern layoffs.                            August 8   Texas Air reports $255.9 million loss in second quarter.                            August 26   Judge Parker extends order against layoffs, but leaves doubt about whether Eastern can cut operations and sell planes.                            August 30   Judge Parker permits Eastern to cut schedule, but continues to block layoffs. Eastern launches emergency appeal.</TEXT></DOC>
