From Fortune 500 conglomerates to the neighborhood diner, employers this month began facing fines for first-time offenses under the nation's new immigration law. Repeat offenders may even face arrest -- just as illegal immigrants always have.    The Immigration Reform and Control Act, though adopted in 1986, has taken effect gradually. For many of the nation's seven million employers, the law has been difficult to understand and often cumbersome to follow. Besides making it illegal -- for the first time -- to hire an illegal immigrant, the law imposes new record-keeping requirements for virtually everyone who regularly employs anyone.    The Immigration and Naturalization Service insists it is enforcing the law with moderation. &quot;We aren't going to write fine notices left and right,&quot; an agency official says. But some attorneys representing employers believe that INS agents actually are all too eager to show their teeth.    &quot;Their attitude is just like the IRS: You put the fear of God in them and they will comply,&quot; says lawyer Peter Larrabee, a former Border Patrol agent who now represents employers against the INS.    The following questions and answers may help employers escape getting fined -- or even going to jail.    How much can they fine me for hiring an illegal immigrant?    For the first offense of knowingly hiring an illegal, an employer can be fined from $250 to $2,000 a worker; for the second offense, $2,000 to $5,000; for the third and subsequent offenses, $3,000 to $10,000 each. If employers show a &quot;pattern or practice&quot; of violating the law, they can face criminal sanctions of $3,000 for each worker and up to six months in jail.    Is it true that I can be fined for paperwork violations, even if I've never hired an illegal immigrant?    Yes. An employer is required to fill out a government form, known as the I-9, for every employee hired after Nov. 6, 1986. A fine can be levied for not properly filling out, retaining or presenting this form for inspection. The civil fines range from $100 to $1,000 for each violation. In March, the largest fine yet sought by the INS under the new law -- $27,000 -- was issued against the Big Bear Markets grocery-store chain in San Diego for 135 paperwork violations. The INS says that 132 of the violations were for failure to fill out the I-9 government form. Big Bear is appealing the fine.    So if the INS hits me with a fine, I can appeal?    Yes, within 30 days of receiving the notice, an employer can request a hearing before a Justice Department administrative law judge. After that, the U.S. attorney general's office can, within 30 days, vacate or modify the administrative law judge's decision. The employer has 45 days to appeal the administrative law judge's order to a U.S. Court of Appeals.    Why bother appealing if I get fined? Why not just pay the fine as a cost of doing business and get it over with?    If you are guilty, that's the appropriate route, attorneys say. It can easily cost $10,000 to defend against a $3,000 fine. But if you have a plausible defense and don't exercise it, it could affect your potential liability down the line, says Paul W. Schmidt, a Washington attorney and former INS acting general counsel. &quot;If you start stringing up a number of those (fines), the government will have a pretty good pattern,&quot; which could lead to criminal charges and a possible jail sentence.    It's one thing for the INS to go after a big grocery-store chain. But do I have to fill out an I-9 form when my kid sister comes over to baby-sit?    Congress considered, but rejected, an exemption for small employers. A boss is exempt from the paperwork requirements, though, if the situation involves &quot;casual employment by individuals who provide domestic service in a private home&quot; on a &quot;sporadic, irregular or intermittent&quot; basis. But even a baby sitter or maid held to a regular schedule must have an I-9 form on file.    Am I liable for independent contractors and their employees?    No. For example, if you contract with a company to provide temporary clerical help, you don't have to complete I-9s for those employees. However, the INS says you must not &quot;knowingly use contract labor to circumvent the law against hiring unauthorized workers.&quot;    We've got laws that forbid me from asking applicants about age, race and ethnicity. Yet the I-9 forms require me in some cases to check birth certificates, citizenship documents and legal-residency cards. Can I break a civil-rights law while complying with the new immigration law?    Yes, but you can take steps to avoid it. Many attorneys advise requesting nationality documents only after you've offered someone a job. You also might come up with an application form that simply asks job seekers to affirm their eligibility to work in the U.S.    Wouldn't it be safer just to hire people who don't speak with accents?    No. The new law prohibits discrimating against an individual -- other than an illegal immigrant -- in hiring, discharging or recruiting because of national origin or citizenship. What's more, these provisions apply to bosses who employ as few as four people, while earlier civil-rights laws apply only to employers of 14 or more.    I know that if a worker has a driver's license and a Social Security card, that's all I have to ask for to satisfy the law's requirements. But you can buy forgeries anywhere. Am I supposed to become an expert in fake documents, too?    The INS says that if the documents appear to be &quot;genuine on their face and to relate to the person,&quot; you should accept them.    What if INS agents come into my place of business brandishing subpoenas and ask to see not only my I-9s, but all of my payroll records, work schedules and Internal Revenue Service forms, such as W-2s?    Under INS regulations, the agency &quot;shall have reasonable access to see any relevant evidence of any person being investigated.&quot; Rosario Silvestro of Channel Fish Co., Boston, sued the INS in federal court, claiming the agency went on a &quot;fishing expedition&quot; and conducted an &quot;unduly intrusive and burdensome&quot; investigation with an overly broad subpoena. A federal judge, however, ordered the small, family-owned business to comply. Mr. Silvestro says it's too costly to appeal.    Can I require that my new employees put up a bond as &quot;protection&quot; from the penalties of the new law?    Do it, says the INS, and you'll face a civil fine of $1,000 for each bond and an order to return the money to the worker. </TEXT></DOC>
