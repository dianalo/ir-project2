The American economy is booming, unemployment will soon fall to its lowest level since the 1960s, and popular expectations are rising. As the history of the 1960s will testify, the appearance of prosperity in the private sector does not reduce demands for more spending in the public sector. It usually increases the sense of frustration among groups who felt they have not shared in the prosperity or have some other grievance about the distribution of income in the society. In the case of the 1988 election, this new sense of rising expectations is being further magnified by a perception that the austerity which Mr. Reagan imposed on many discretionary areas of federal expenditures will soon be followed by a more tolerant attitude towards government expenditure. </TEXT></DOC>
