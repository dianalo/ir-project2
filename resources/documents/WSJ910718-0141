As an example of that trait, Mr.Gigot states that the governor has used &quot;his line-item veto683 (]) times.&quot;   Your readers should be aware that the Wisconsin &quot;partial&quot;veto is not, as Mr. Gigot assumes, merely a &quot;line-item veto.&quot;As the Seventh Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals recognized, in adecision the Journal noted on April 19, the governor has usedhis authority to veto &quot;part of an appropriation bill &quot;tochange the meaning&quot; of bills, by deleting &quot;phrases, words(such as `not') -- even individual letters and digits --within an individual item or provision. . . .&quot; The courtconceded that the governor has used this power &quot;to createlaws that the legislature did not consider, let alone enact.&quot;It stated that Wisconsin has decided to proceed down a roadthat leads to &quot;rule by executive decree, with no legislatureat all.&quot; However, the court held that there is &quot;no federaljudicial remedy&quot; for these actions.</LP><TEXT>   For the Founders of our nation, it was &quot;a fundamentalprinciple of a free government, and especially of arepublican government, that no laws ought to be passedwithout the cooperation and consent of the representatives ofthe people. . . .&quot; (Joseph Story, &quot;Commentaries on theConstitution of The United States,&quot; Little Brown, 1851).&quot;{C}onsent to statutory law either in person or byrepresentation was the test for determining the existence ofliberty {that was} most commonly stated . . .&quot; at the time ofthe American Revolution (John Phillip Reid, &quot;The Concept ofLiberty in the Age of the American Revolution&quot; University ofChicago Press, 1988).   This fundamental principle was established in England asearly as 1322, and was reaffirmed when the King agreed, in1414, that no statute would be enacted contrary to the intentof the Parliament, whereby the House of Commons &quot;should bebound without their assent.&quot; (William Blackstone,&quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England,&quot; Callaghan andamp; Co.,1884). As Blackstone observed in 1765, &quot;the consent of allthree {Commons, Lords and King} --  is required to make anynew law that shall bind the subject.&quot;   The King and the Lords might prevent a majority of theHouse of Commons from enacting legislation that it desired.But the people, by virtue of their representation in theHouse of Commons, also had the constitutional &quot;privilege ofrejecting&quot; legislation. According to Blackstone, this&quot;privilege&quot; was based on the premise that,&quot; {i}n a free stateevery man, who is supposed a free agent, ought to be in somemeasure his own governor; and therefore a branch at least ofthe legislative power should reside in the whole body of thepeople.&quot;   The American Revolution was based on this concept ofliberty. When the First Continental Congress claimed that thecolonists were entitled to &quot;the rights of Englishmen,&quot; itdeclared &quot;{t}hat the foundation of English liberty, and ofall free government, is the right in the people toparticipate in their legislative council.&quot; The first stateconstitutions of Virginia (1776), Pennsylvania (1776) andMassachusetts (1780) explicitly declare, in virtuallyidentical terms, that no statute may be enacted without theconsent of either the people themselves, or theirrepresentatives in a legislative assembly. The Constitutionembodies this principle in the requirement that no law may beenacted without the concurrence and consent of the House ofRepresentatives. And each state constitution that was adoptedbefore 1787 also reflects this principle in its respectiveprescription for legislative action. In short, thisfundamental right was viewed by the Founders as one of those&quot;without which a people cannot be free&quot; (Clinton Rossiter,&quot;Seedtime of the Republic,&quot; New York, 1953)   Wisconsin has become a &quot;laboratory&quot; for an experiment thatcannot be reconciled with the Founders' concept of a freesociety. It is not the kind of &quot;daring&quot; that others shouldseek to emulate.   Dave Travis (D.)   Assembly Majority Leader   Madison, Wis.</TEXT></DOC>
