(products).andO;Product:   Nisus 3.01 (Word processing software).andO;Topic:     Word Processing SoftwareEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Nisus 3.01andM;Any word processor designed for the high end of the word processing marketwill inevitably be compared to Microsoft Word, and Nisus 3.01 fares well inthis department.andP;  From the beginning we've been impressed with Nisus' verylong list of features, and the upgrade includes even more.andM;Paragon Concepts has addressed every complaint voiced in our review of Nisus2.02 (see MacWEEK, Sept.andP;  26, 1989).andP;  A partial list of improvementsincludes:andM;andgt;Style sheets.andP;  Paragon Concepts has finally incorporated style sheets intoNisus and done it well.andP;  Nisus style sheets function essentially the same wayas Microsoft Word's style sheets: They incorporate both character andparagraph attributes and are document-specific.andP;  Importing style sheets fromother documents is also similar to Word.andM;andgt;Saner menu organization.andP;  While it's not fantastic, nor even very good, menuorganization is much improved.andP;  It's still too heavy on the submenus,although we'd be hard pressed to incorporate Nisus' hundreds of commands in asimpler fashion.andM;andgt;Keyboard equivalents.andP;  Fortunately, Nisus 3.01 includes customizablekeyboard equivalents for almost every function in the byzantine menus.andP;  Ifyou use the Print command more often than the Plain Text command, you caneasily reassign the Command-P keyboard equivalent.andP;  If you're used to thekeyboard equivalents of a particular word processor, in just a few minutesyou can customize Nisus 3.01 so that you'll feel as if you never left home.andO;The only feature lacking here is the capability to configure the menusthemselves.andM;andgt;Non-contiguous selection.andP;  For the first time, you can select non-contiguousparts of a document.andP;  This natural extension of the original Mac interface,combined with Nisus' useful capability to append selections to the Clipboard,results in an extremely powerful feature with many applications.andM;andgt;Enhanced graphics support.andP;  The new Place Page feature, which allows you toimport Nisus documents into editable and resizable boxes, enhances Nisus'already robust drawing features so that Nisus 3.01 will be the only softwarepurchase required for many simple business page-layout applications.andM;Some of the minor annoyances of earlier versions of Nisus have beenaddressed, while others remain.andP;  Triple-clicking now selects a sentenceinstead of a single line, but there is still no interactive setting for smart(curly) quotes, although a supplied macro will correctly apply smart quotesto a selection.andP;  The documentation is sometimes obtuse and the help system isless than state of the art.andM;When confronted with so much, it's tempting to demand even more.andP;  We'd liketo see Nisus adopt the powerful file-conversion features available inMacWrite II and Microsoft Word's capability to divide a document intosections.andP;  But with Nisus 3.01, users can process words with almost all thetools available to Word users.andP;  (Faster performance certainly makes up forthe features it lacks.)andM;In sum, Nisus 3.01 is truly an amazing word processor and possibly one of themost powerful available for any personal computer.andP;  Expect to spend a littleextra time exploring its many features.andP;  Any organization or individual whoconsiders fast, powerful text and document creation, manipulation andmanagement to be a critical task would be foolish not to carefully considerthis $395 product.andP;  Upgrades from Version 2.0 are $65 plus shipping.andM;Paragon Concepts Inc. is at 990 Highland Drive, Suite 312, Solana Beach,Calif.andP;  92075; (619) 481-1477.andP;  -- By Dale Coleman</TEXT></DOC>
