Grubb was named president and chief operating officer effective May 1, ending uncertainty about the posts.    Until earlier this month, the posts were held by William C. Terpstra, who resigned unexpectedly from this unit of Occidental Petroleum Corp.    Mr. Grubb, 51 years old, currently is president of MidCon Services Co., a unit of MidCon that markets natural gas and gas transmission services for MidCon's three operating pipeline networks. MidCon, acquired last year by Occidental, is a pipeline concern based in Lombard, Ill.    As reported, MidCon has declined to say why the 47-year-old Mr. Terpstra resigned. A spokeswoman described the resignation as &quot;a personal decision.&quot; His titles temporarily have been assumed by Orval C. Davis, who is also chairman and chief executive officer.    Mr. Grubb will be succeeded as president of MidCon Services by Robert E. Hodge, 49, who currently is MidCon Corp.'s vice president for planning and administration. </TEXT></DOC>
