<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-71-0632 </DOCNO><TEXT>Comparison of detailed calculations of contributions by region and componentof the power-reactivity-decrements (PRD) for four differing loading configurationsof the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) are given. The linearcomponents and Doppler components are calculated. The non-linear (primarilysubassembly bowing) components are deduced by differences relative tomeasured total PRD values. Variations in linear components range fromabout 10% to as much as about a factor of two depending upon the component.The deduced non-linear components can differ both in magnitude and sign.Effects of differing assumptions of the nature of the fuel-to-clad interactionsupon the PRD components are also calculated.</TEXT></DOC>
