Sales were in a slump for Avon cosmetics, Fuller brushes and many other products peddled door-to-door. What's more, recruiting new salespeople had become extremely difficult.    It seems the deathwatch was premature. Last year, Avon Products Inc.'s direct-sales beauty business posted a 7% sales gain, Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc. believes when it closes the books on 1987, sales will have approached or surpassed its record 1983 sales of $323.8 million, and Premark International Inc.'s Tupperware division says U.S. sales seem to have finally bottomed out.    &quot;Since we felt the pinch in the early 1980s, we've become much more consumer-oriented,&quot; says James Preston, president of Avon's beauty group. To its distress, Avon learned a few years ago that many women considered its makeup line &quot;stodgy,&quot; its gift products overpriced and its jewelry unfashionable.    So Avon increased the number of gift items priced under $15 and created &quot;more contemporary&quot; jewelry. Last month it revamped its lipstick and nail-polish line.    The growing ranks of working women still pose a problem for salespeople who find no one at home. But saleswomen now follow customers to work. Already, 25% of Tupperware party demonstrations are away from home in such locations as offices and day-care centers.    Companies also have been attracting more new sales recruits and boosting productivity since they improved incentive-compensation plans and training programs. (Avon says the number of salespeople selling over $8,000 of merchandise rose 8.5% in 1987.)    Despite such encouraging signs, there's still uncertainty about how robust the recovery will be over the long term. Says Jack Salzman, an analyst at Goldman Sachs: &quot;The turnaround in direct selling will depend heavily on consumers' real spendable income and continued success in recruiting salespeople.&quot;    Looking to Sell   'Organic' Baby Food   IN 1987's &quot;Baby Boom,&quot; actress Diane Keaton moved to a Vermont farm and struck gold when she created a homemade applesauce called Country Baby. Now an actual Vermont company hopes life will imitate art as it launches its &quot;organic&quot; Earth's Best baby food, which is free of synthetic chemicals and other additives.    &quot;We're marketing to people who have been making fresh baby food at home instead of buying Gerber or one of the other major brands,&quot; explains Bob Donnola, sales and marketing manager of Earth's Best. &quot;Young parents today tend to be pickier about their babies than about themselves.&quot;    Earth's Best isn't the only marketer of natural or gourmet baby food attempting to capitalize on the baby boomlet sweeping the U.S. Mommy Made delivers fresh baby food to homes and offices in New York City; Natural Food Products sells &quot;close to homemade&quot; Baby's Garden; and Growing Gourmet serves up microwave casseroles for toddlers.    Mr. Donnola says Earth's Best could have bought rights to the Country Baby brand name in &quot;Baby Boom.&quot; But, he adds, &quot;we don't want to hitch our star to a movie that's popular for only a few months.&quot;    Just How Healthy   Are Campbell Soups?    CONSUMER HEALTH organizations are turning up the heat on Campbell Soup because of controversial nutrition claims in its ads.    First, attorneys for the National Cancer Institute instructed the company to remove all references to NCI from magazine ads. In promoting the fiber content and lack of fat in bean and pea soups, Campbell's ads had cited NCI's findings that a high-fiber, low-fat diet may reduce the risk of cancer. But NCI decided it wanted nothing to do with the Campbell promotion because of the &quot;excessive&quot; sodium level in most soups. Campbell complied with NCI's demand.    Then last month, the Center for Science in the Public Interest filed a petition with the Federal Trade Commission, complaining about an ad that touts chicken noodle soup as low in fat and cholesterol and helpful in fighting heart disease. The watchdog group objects to the claim because it believes the sodium content of most soups can help lead to high blood pressure.    The complaint also attacks a Campbell ad that boasts about tomato soup's calcium benefits. But the calcium isn't in the soup; it comes from milk that people may use instead of water to dilute the condensed soup.    Campbell insists the ads are carefully worded and aren't misleading. For example, a spokesman says, the heart-disease ad notes that Campbell makes a line of reduced-salt soups. -   Midwest School Tries   To Attract Blacks   EVERY YEAR, leading American colleges compete fiercely for the best and brightest black students. Now, Grinnell College in Iowa plans to resort to an unusual marketing technique.    This spring, the school will spend about $23,000 to run full-page ads in Ebony magazine's Midwest edition, featuring jazz musician Herbie Hancock, one of Grinnell's most famous black alumni. The ads note that Grinnell was the first college west of the Mississippi to grant a bachelor of arts degree to a black.    &quot;We're competing against the Ivy League schools, but we don't have as much awareness,&quot; says Floyd Akins, coordinator of minority admissions. &quot;Blacks think Iowa is in the middle of nowhere. We hope a sophisticated ad will change that impression.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
