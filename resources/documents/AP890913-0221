(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Evangelist Oral Roberts announced Wednesdaythat he will close his City of Faith hospital and medical school andsell his home to help make up for a $25 million deficit caused by adrop in donations.   Four other ministry-owned homes, including his evangelist sonRichard's house, and an 830-unit housing complex for marriedstudents at Oral Roberts University here, also will be sold, Robertstold a campus news conference.   He said the 777-bed hospital would close by Jan. 1 and themedical school, which is part of the university, would shut downwith the end of classes next May.   Roberts, who in 1987 raised $8 million for the medical schoolafter saying God would end his life if the money didn't come in,left open the possibility ``some miracle'' could happen. But he saidthe action was necessary to save the 4,300-student university.   ``I think it's one of the best decisions I've ever made,'' the71-year-old evangelist said. ``I hurt because this is my calling,but I'm encouraged that we're doing the right thing.''   Roberts has blamed the sharp decline in donations to his ministryon a ``spirit of skepticism'' in the wake of scandals involvingfellow evangelists Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart.   He said a $50 million endowment would be needed to prevent theclosing of the medical complex, which Roberts has long considered asymbol of his medical missionary work.   ``Who knows that when this is known across America that someonewe might have been dealing with, or someone we haven't been dealingwith, might say, `I've got the $50 million,''' Roberts said.   He said he had talked to a potential big contributor who mighthave been able to donate the $50 million, but the discussions fellthrough.   ``He hasn't given up yet, but he said the economy is just too badnow,'' said Roberts, who would not identify the man.   Roberts talked to students, faculty and staff of the hospital andmedical school in an emotional meeting early Wednesday to explainthe crisis afflicting his ministry, the Oral Roberts EvangelisticAssociation.   He told them that at least half of the $25 million was needed topay vendors, and that the remainder was owed for various costs,including mortages.   ``I asked the Lord to not let me cry because I've cried all thetears I thought I could cry. And sure enough, I didn't cry,'' hesaid.   The five homes and the housing complex will be sold as soon as abuyer can be found, said Mark Swadener, chief fiscal officer for theministry. The homes sit on 9 acres near the 400-acre ministrycomplex.   Oral Roberts' 6,328-square-foot, four-bedroom home was valued atabout $500,000 in 1987. The value of his son's 7,091-square-foot,two-story home was put at $547,000 that year.   City of Faith hospital employs 600 staff members and the medicalschool has 147 students and about 100 faculty, said school Dean Dr.Larry Edwards. The 27 seniors at the school will be allowed tograduate. The other students will be be helped in seeking transfersto other medical schools.   ``It's not going to stop me from being a doctor and it's notgoing to stop me from being a medical missionary,'' said medicalstudent David Chorley.   The hospital, part of a three-tower complex with 60-story,30-story and 20-story buildings, will be leased and the revenuegenerated dedicated to the ministry's endowment, Roberts said.   Swadener would not say how much money the sales and the closingswould bring.   ``After the dust has settled, we'll take a look at it,'' he said.   Some university students approved Roberts' action. Tulsa MayorRoger Randle said he believed the evangelist made the rightdecision. ``We have a short-term loss, but a strengthened ability tosurvive in the long term,'' Randle said.   The financial problems involving Roberts and his ministry havebeen well chronicled.   Roberts' 1986 plea for $8 million caused a furor, but the moneywas raised.   Last March, Roberts said he needed $11 million to keep creditorsfrom dismantling the ministry, university and hospital. The moneywas needed to pay past-due bills from more than 4,000 vendors, hesaid.   The six-week fund drive, which the evangelist termed alife-or-death struggle for his ministry, ended successfully in May.   At the time, ministry spokeswoman Jan Dargatz said contributionswould have to continue at a level of about $3.3 million per month tosustain the medical center, the ministry and the university.   Monthly contributions to the ministry declined from $5 million to$2.7 million, ministry officials said.   When Roberts built the City of Faith, which opened in 1981,officials at Tulsa's five other hospitals harshly criticized him,saying Tulsa didn't need another hospital.   Although the hospital has 777 beds, it is licensed for no morethan 294 patients and has never had an annual average higher than148.   Roberts announced in May that the university's athletic programswere dropping out of National Collegiate Athletic Associationcompetition immediately to save an estimated $500,000 to $1 milliona year.   The ministry also canceled contracts with some commercialtelevision stations that had been airing the daily show hosted byRichard Roberts, 41.   Oral Roberts University has more than 4,300 undergraduate andgraduate students.</TEXT></DOC>
