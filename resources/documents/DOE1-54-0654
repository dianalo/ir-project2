<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-54-0654 </DOCNO><TEXT>In a sample of 670 000 charged-current neutrino events, 101 {mu}{sup -}{mu}{sup-} events have been observed, with 30 GeVandless;E/sub {nu}/andless;600 GeV and P/sub{mu}/andgt;9 GeV/c for both muons. After background subtraction, 18.5 +- 13.9events remain, yielding a prompt rate of (5.5 +- 4.1) x 10/sup -5/ percharged-current event. A sample of 124 000 antineutrino events yields15 {mu}{sup +}{mu}{sup +} events, giving 6.4 +- 4.2 events after backgroundsubtraction and a prompt rate of (1.0 +- 0.7) x 10/sup -4/ per charged-currentevent. The numbers and kinematic distributions of these events are consistentwith standard model sources.</TEXT></DOC>
