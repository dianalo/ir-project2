His mother deemed him uncontrollable andtried for two months to have him placed in state custody, but stateofficials refused.   Protective custody, the state said, is for children who areabused or abandoned, not those with behavior problems that requiretreatment. Today, Scott is in state custody _ accused of murder.   Scott is confined at the Maine Youth Center in South Portland,accused of setting a New Year's Eve fire at a six-unit apartmentbuilding in Biddeford that killed a 53-year-old man.   Authorities have not decided whether the boy will be tried as ajuvenile or an adult.   Officials who deal with emotionally troubled youngsters say Scottis one of many children who need help but cannot get it becausethere are not enough resources to go around.   Roger Raymond, Biddeford's special education director, said hecontacted the state Department of Human Services two months agobecause he feared Scott was at risk.   ``It's terrible what happened,'' Raymond said. ``It goes withoutsaying, we don't have the resources available for kids who are inneed of such services. And I doubt that his situation is unique.''   After a three-hour detention hearing Tuesday, District CourtJudge Robert Crowley found probable cause for a felony murder chargestemming from the fire death of Raymond R. Lauzon. AssistantAttorney General Eric Wright said the boy must appear Jan. 17 inDistrict Court.   Felony murder is a homicide that occurs during the commission ofa felony, in this case arson, in which someone's death is areasonably foreseeable result.   Should Scott be tried as a juvenile and convicted, he couldremain in the custody of the state until he is 21 or 22 years old.If tried for murder as an adult, he would face a minimum of 25 yearsin prison and a maximum life term.   At Tuesday's hearing, Scott's 8-year-old brother, Jason, told thecourt that the two boys had been visiting Lauzon and were told toleave when the older boy was caught trying to steal money fromLauzon's bedroom.   Jason said he walked away but Scott lingered around the apartmentbuilding before joining him later.   In interviews and court testimony, juvenile caseworkers, schoolofficials and Scott's mother, Janet Sullivan, portrayed him as anemotionally troubled youngster who had been placed in three specialschools but remained uncontrollable.   For the past three months he had run away about once a week fromMs. Sullivan, 31, who is divorced, jobless and on welfare, accordingto testimony.   A spokesman at the Department of Human Services said Scott'sproblems were not so severe that he needed to be placed in a fosterhome or residential treatment center.   Peter Walsh, director of the Bureau of Social Services, said thedepartment ``never found this child to be in jeopardy and needinghis relationship with his parent severed.''</TEXT></DOC>
