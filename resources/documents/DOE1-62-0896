<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-62-0896 </DOCNO><TEXT>Modern Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is implemented with digitalcomputers that periodically sample tie line real power flows, line frequency,and generator power outputs. These analog signals are usually measuredto second periodically and combined with desired interchange to obtainthe Area Control Error (ACE). The ACE digital quantity is allocated toregulating hydro turbines and transmitted via telemetry to the remoteterminal untis (RTU). The RTUs convert the raise/lower megawatts (MW)into timed relay contact closures to the governor which result in wicketgate open/close movement to change the generator output power. The outputpower of each generator is monitored by the digital AGC which closesa feedback loop around the governor-turbine-generator to assure the desiredpower level is attained. This paper describes the feedback loop design,which is essentially a sampled-data control. Additional feedback loopsdue to the ACE and load regulation are also analyzed. A method is presentedfor allocating water usage between reservoirs on a generator command-timebasis. The theoretical designs are verified by on-line measurements presentedin the paper.</TEXT></DOC>
