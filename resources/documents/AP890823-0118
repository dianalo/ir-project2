The unarmed emigre who had a history of petty crime said he tookover the passenger flight from Paris to Algiers to call attention to``the need to end violence in Lebanon and Palestine.''   The plane's pilot, Joseph Valat, told Algerian Radio the hijackerhad asked to go to Tunis, Tunisia, then the Algerian cities ofAnnaba and Constantine, but those airports refused landingpermission and the aircraft landed at its original destination ofAlgiers.   Valat said the air pirate had used a can of shaving cream as his``weapon.'' He earlier was reported to have used a bottle of sprayperfume.   In a statement at Algiers' Houari Boumedienne airport, he calledfor ``the holding of an international conference on Lebanon, theopening of a dialogue between the PLO and Israel and the liberationof all hostages and prisoners in the region.''   Algerian police identified the hijacker as Said Djamel, aliasBendada, and said he was a 30-year-old merchant in Paris.   The French news agency Agence France-Presse, citing unidentifiedsources in Paris, said the man was being expelled for ``violatingpublic order,'' and said he ``displayed great agitation'' beforebeing put on the flight to Algiers.   An Air France spokeswoman said the hijacking ended at 3:25 p.m.(10:25 a.m. EDT), barely an hour after the plane landed. She saidthe 102 passengers and 13 crew members were safe.   The air pirate, allowed to make a statement before being takenfor questioning, told reporters he used the toiletry articles as hisonly ``weapons.''   The pilot, in a statement at the airport, said the hijacker had abig object under his jacket to give the appearance of a weapon andthat he made known he was capable of blowing up the plane. In theradio interview later, he said the air pirate had concealed a can ofshaving cream.   The hijacking came amid heightened tensions between France andMoslem forces fighting in Lebanon. The Syrian forces and theirallied Moslem militias recently said they would shell Frenchwarships gathering in the eastern Mediterranean if they intervenedmilitarily in Lebanon.   France said the warships were dispatched to evacuate 7,000 Frenchnationals in Lebanon if the 5-month-old battle between Moslem andChristian forces worsens. But the Moslems accuse the French ofbacking the Christians.</TEXT></DOC>
