Bill Clinton spent awhirlwind day in Southern California doing nothing butcourting the famous and wealthy. On the grounds of a Bel Airmansion owned by a music industry executive, Mr. Clintonmingled with a crowd of Hollywood film and music producers,movie agents and industry lawyers who had each shelled out$500 to meet him.   As the guests sampled an array of rich desserts, they tookturns grilling Mr. Clinton about his stands on theenvironment and education. The candidate patiently answeredtheir questions until his voice was hoarse, knowing that theinvestment would pay off. When he climbed aboard his campaignplane for the trip back East, he had collected more than$140,000 in campaign contributions.   Hollywood not only produces money but also glamour andglitz -- which in turn generate more money. During his tripto California, Mr. Clinton took time out of his officialschedule for a private audience with actor-director RobertRedford on a Hollywood movie set. An endorsement from Mr.Redford, who has his own network of political activists andpotential donors, would be an important show of Hollywoodmuscle for the Arkansas governor. It was considered a coupwhen Mr. Clinton won the endorsement of actor RichardDreyfus, who employs his own in-house political consultant,Donna Bojarsky.   Mr. Clinton's success at winning Hollywood money andendorsements from such industry powers as Tri-Star Pictureschief Mike Medavoy and independent producer Dawn Steel hascome as something of a surprise. At the outset of thecampaign, Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey was touted as Hollywood'sleading man for 1992, in part because of his onetime romancewith actress Debra Winger. Indeed, it was Mr. Clinton whodubbed Mr. Kerrey &quot;Hollywood's candidate&quot; during a campaignappearance in Atlanta last fall.   But despite endorsements from an array of prominent peoplein the movie industry, including actress Sally Field and filmproducer Ted Field (no relation), Mr. Kerrey hasn't beengenerating that much money or excitement.   &quot;He was tainted with the Hollywood image without themoney,&quot; grumbles one of his campaign workers. In fact, whileMr. Kerrey's campaign got a boost from a $175,000 fund-raiserat the home of Fox Inc. Chairman Barry Diller, Mr. Dillerco-hosted an event for Mr. Clinton just a few weeks later.   Last week, it was Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin's turn to try toshake the money trees -- or in this case, palms. While he hasthe support of some old-line Hollywood liberals, he has hadonly limited success so far. Still, as befits a prairiepopulist, he was feted by television's favorite blue-collarpair, Roseanne and Tom Arnold, who hosted a $250 per personfund-raiser for him. Co-sponsors of the Harkin gala includedthe television actor Edward Asner and music producer DannyGoldberg. (Mr. Harkin couldn't make it himself, but his wifeRuth stood in for him.)   So far, none of the Democratic candidates have raised thekind of campaign gold that the 1988 Democratic hopefuls minedin Hollywood. During the 1988 primary season, a singlereception hosted by Mr. Field raised more than $400,000 forcandidate Joseph Biden. (Thus, it was big news when RobertBurkett, the crack fund-raiser who works for Mr. Field,signed on as Sen. Kerrey's national finance chairman). Mr.Dukakis went on to raise stunning sums in SouthernCalifornia.   The promise of such big money keeps bleary-eyed candidatesflying from the snow drifts to the California desert. Moneyraised in Hollywood today means campaign commercials cancontinue running in New Hampshire tomorrow. &quot;It's too muchmoney to ignore,&quot; says former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, whorecalls making the tiring trek many times to subsidize his1988 presidential campaign.   But it's sometimes an awkward mating dance. Hollywoodpower brokers want to be loved for their ideas, not justtheir money. &quot;These people want to be stroked personally,&quot;says Mr. Babbitt. &quot;They are very intense about issues, andtremendously naive.&quot;   In Hollywood, it's routine for movie stars and moguls toemploy their own personal political consultants who advisethem on which candidates and causes to embrace. Mr. Clintonand Mr. Kerrey have both met privately to discuss theirplatforms with executives from Creative Artists Agency, thetalent shop run by super-agent Michael Ovitz, whoseendorsement carries considerable weight. Mr. Babbitt stillrecalls an issues forum hosted by the Hollywood Women'sPolitical Committee as &quot;the single most intense give-and-takesession that I ever attended.&quot;   The candidates subject themselves to these sometimesdemeaning sessions because organizations such as the HWPC canpump hundreds of thousands of dollars into their campaigns.But this year the HWPC hasn't had many presidentialcandidates beating a path to its door. That's because thegroup announced it wouldn't endorse or contribute to any ofthe 1992 Democrats before the general election. &quot;If theywanted to come through, we told them we'd be glad to scheduletheir appearance, but that they couldn't raise money,&quot;explains Margery Tabankin, the group's executive director.   None of the candidates have asked to address the group.&quot;This is California and they want money,&quot; Ms. Tabankin saysmatter-of-factly.   Former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas, who touts hisanti-movie star image in his New Hampshire television ads,hasn't made the Hollywood rounds, although his campaign hasheld several fund-raising events elsewhere in California.Former California Gov. Jerry Brown does have some Hollywoodsupport, but he isn't accepting any contributions of morethan $100. Ms. Tabankin says she has several friends who havegiven Mr. Brown small contributions to support his call forcampaign finance reform. &quot;This town is sick of money andpolitics,&quot; she says. &quot;That's all people come here for.&quot;   While a few mega-stars such as Arnold Schwarzenegger andCharlton Heston are GOP stalwarts and some Hollywood moneyfalls into Republican coffers, the movie industry isn't animportant part of the party's financial base in California.By contrast, it is one of the few well-heeled industries inAmerica where Democrats can go to raise significant amountsof cash.   A number of Hollywood's most important political playershave been lying lower this year. The liberal, politicallyactive producer Norman Lear, who hosted issues dinners withall the major 1988 Democratic candidates, hasn't held similarsessions this time. With two U.S. Senate races in the stateand congressional redistricting, some big givers areconcentrating their efforts on California, instead ofnational, politics. &quot;A lot of people are waiting for ashake-out after New Hampshire,&quot; says one veteran Hollywoodproducer. &quot;Then they'll all make a stampede for thefront-runner.&quot; Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Clinton are alreadyplanning splashy post-New Hampshire fund-raising events inLos Angeles.   And, in a rare role reversal, Mr. Clinton may bring someHollywood glitz to New Hampshire. Harry and LindaBloodworth-Thomason, the producers of the hit televisionprograms &quot;Evening Shade&quot; and &quot;Designing Women,&quot; hope tocampaign for Mr. Clinton in New Hampshire with some castmembers in tow. The Thomasons, natives of Arkansas, are oldfriends of the Clintons, and they have raised tens ofthousands of Hollywood dollars for their candidate. &quot;We'dlike to help him win some votes, too,&quot; says Ms.Bloodworth-Thomason.</TEXT></DOC>
