DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. traderCarey J. Maultasch on Tuesday was barred permanently from thesecurities industry for his part in Wall Street's biggest insidertrading scandal.   Maultasch, 37, once a senior trader under junk bond financierMichael Milken, the former chief of Drexel's Beverly Hills,Calif.-based high yield bond department, settled civil securitiesfraud charges in April without admitting or denying guilt.   As part of the settlement, the Securities and ExchangeCommission instituted an administrative proceeding _ to whichMaultasch previously had agreed _ barring him permanently fromassociating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser orinvestment company.   ``Previously it was announced that the settlement had beenreached,'' said Teresa A. Koncick, a branch chief with the SEC'senforcement division. ``This means it is now official.''   Maultasch was not required to pay any fines or other financialpenalty as part of the settlement. He has not been chargedcriminally.   ``Mr. Maultasch is now obviously out of the securities business,as he has been for some time,'' said a Maultasch lawyer, Aubrey B.Harwell Jr., of Nashville, Tenn.   Harwell said Maultasch was trying to organize a business butdeclined to say what kind.   Another Maultasch lawyer, Reid Weingarten of Washington,declined to say where Maultasch, formerly of New York, was nowliving.   The SEC charged Maultasch and other Drexel employees, includingMilken, with secretly scheming to break securities laws with jailedstock speculator Ivan F. Boesky.   Drexel, the nation's fifth-largest securities firm, andMaultasch agreed to settle the SEC charges late last year in NewYork. Approval of the settlements by U.S. District Judge MiltonPollack was delayed until June 20 because of a legal challenge byMilken's lawyers.   Milken and his brother, Lowell, another former Drexel employee,who also was charged in the SEC lawsuit, were indicted March 29 onracketeering and securities fraud charges. They have proclaimedtheir innocence and vowed to fight both the civil and criminalcharges.   Both Milkens have resigned from Drexel. The firm had agreed tofire them as part of its settlement with the SEC, which also placedDrexel under strict supervision. Drexel neither admitted nor deniedwrongdoing in the SEC settlement.   The firm also has agreed to plead guilty to six felony countsand pay a record $650 million in fines and restitution.</TEXT></DOC>
