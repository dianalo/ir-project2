GalanteStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/28/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LABOR TAXES GEBRETAILING (RET)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><TEXT>   SMALL-BUSINESS LOBBYISTS for most of this year fought a rear-guard action in Washington against a legion of employee benefit bills sponsored by pro-labor lawmakers. &quot;There is no good news for small business on employee benefits,&quot; says John S. Satagaj, president of the Small Business Legislative Council. &quot;I think we did less than a top-notch job&quot; in slowing the progress of such legislation.    None of the major pro-labor bills were enacted into law, but several of them made major advances. &quot;We bought a year,&quot; says John Sloan Jr., president of the National Federation of Small Business. But, he adds, &quot;1988 is going to be a horrendous year.&quot;    The House of Representatives approved three bills that irk business owners. One would require employers to notify and transfer employees who work in high-risk operations. Another would prevent unionized construction companies from setting up separate, nonunionized divisions. The third would ban the use of lie detectors to test employees. In addition, a House committee last month approved a measure that would require companies with 50 or more employees to give unpaid leave for family or medical reasons.    Action on these bills now shifts to the Senate, which has passed one pro-labor measure of its own. This would require companies to give employees advance notice of plant closings.    Mr. Satagaj says business owners themselves are at least partly to blame for the progress of these bills. &quot;We made a lot of visits to the Hill this year,&quot; he says. &quot;In every office, I hear the same thing, whether the congressman is for or against mandated benefits: 'I'm not hearing enough from small business.'&quot;    ---   A NEW CHAPTER OPENED this year for Bookstop Inc., an Austin, Texas, bookstore chain that was profiled here last February. The six-year-old company made its first profit and opened its first store outside the Lone Star State.    Bookstop is among a growing number of retailers known as &quot;superstores&quot; or &quot;category killers&quot; because of their marketing strategy. They strive to beat the competition by offering the broadest selection of a particular product at the lowest possible price. What Toys &quot;R&quot; Us is to toys, for example, Bookstop tries to be to books.    The year has been as good to the category-killer concept in general as it has been to Bookstop. Category-killer chains have sprung up to try to dominate the markets for office supplies, luggage, sporting goods, housewares and even pet supplies. Fred Wintzer, an analyst at Baltimore investment bankers Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc., says the idea is &quot;as hot as a pistol.&quot;    Bookstop began the year with plenty of room for improvement. It had ended its previous fiscal year on Jan. 31 with a loss of $200,000 on sales of $26 million. And a cash-flow squeeze left its 12 stores in Texas with depleted inventories, which undermined the full-line image Bookstop was trying to establish.    Then in March, Bookstop got a $3.5 million shot in the arm from a group of venture capitalists. That allowed the chain to restock its stores, which immediately saw sales revive, according to Bookstop's chairman, Gary E. Hoover. He says the company will post a small profit on sales of more than $30 million when it closes its books next month.    The venture financing also allowed Bookstop to begin expanding outside Texas. Two months ago, it opened a store and a distribution center in Orlando, Fla. It plans to open three more Florida stores and another in Texas in the spring.    ---   SMALL BUSINESSES faced fewer tax changes this year than they did in 1986, though they didn't get away untouched. Last week, Congress settled two tax questions affecting small business, and there was good news and bad news.    Pressures to raise revenue prompted Congress to examine two techniques closely held companies commonly use to avoid estate taxes. Legislators ultimately left intact a strategy that allows a family to reduce its estate taxes by spreading ownership of a company among various family members.    However, lawmakers curbed a tax strategy known as an estate freeze, in which parents convert their common stock to preferred shares and the company issues new common to the next generation of owners. The restrictions are retroactive to Dec. 18.    In another area, Congress revised a provision of the 1986 tax act that would have required partnerships, S corporations and personal-service corporations to conform their fiscal years to the calendar year. The aim of the conformity provision was to prevent owners of such businesses from deferring taxes.    Bowing to the accounting profession, Congress last week decided these businesses could keep their fiscal years. But that won't help owners much, since the legislation also requires the businesses to make a payment -- essentially a nonrefundable deposit -- in lieu of the deferred taxes.    ---   MANHATTAN TOY CO. ends the year the victor in the battle of the dinosaurs. The tiny New York company last spring sued the $1 billion Gerber Products Co. for allegedly infringing its copyrights for plush toy dinosaurs. As part of an out-of-court settlement, Gerber removed its toy behemoths from the market. </TEXT></DOC>
