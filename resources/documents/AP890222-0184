(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Heritage Ministries, the evangelicalremains of the collapsed PTL ministry, says it needs half a milliondollars in donations by March 1 to prevent the cable network fromfalling apart.   Heritage Ministries President Sam Johnson appealed to viewers of``Heritage Ministries Today'' on Monday to preserve the ministry,which is based at the Christian retreat and theme park known asHeritage USA.   He said Heritage Ministries owes $492,600 to its 76 affiliatestations for air time.   ``We must have all of this money in by March 1 or we will losethese stations,' Johnson said.   Johnson said in an interview that donations have lagged becauseof uncertainty over the ministry's future.   Stephen Mernick, a Toronto businessman who bought Heritage USAearlier this year in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, has refused to say whathe plans to do with the theme park or what place Heritage Ministrieshas in his plans.   The Internal Revenue Service revoked PTL's tax-exempt status in1988, citing excessive salaries paid to former PTL leader JimBakker. Heritage Ministries was formed as a non-profit entitydevoted to religious broadcasting.</TEXT></DOC>
