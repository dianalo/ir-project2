(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eastman Kodak Co. says the new 35mm colorfilm for consumers introduced Tuesday represents a majorimprovement in the quality of color photographs, but stock analystssaid they want some proof.   Judging the quality of a photograph by looking at it is verysubjective and that's the problem with the new ``Ektar'' colorfilm, analysts said.   ``How much sharper is sharper? Without a technical measure, Ican't tell if it's 1 percent better or 10 percent better,'' saidBrian Fernandez of Brean Murray, Foster Securities in New York.   The new film was introduced at worldwide news conferencesTuesday.   Kodak has said only that the results from the new film have tobe seen to be believed, but for some, seeing isn't always believing.   Eugene Glazer, of Dean Witter Reynolds in New York, said thephotos he studied taken with the new film look very good, but howgood is a difficult question to answer.   ``I've seen plenty of superb pictures and, to a degree, I cancompare them in my head, but without a side-by-side comparison it'svery tough to say this is the best,'' Glazer said.   Kodak's chief competitor, Fuji Photo Film Co. of Japan, hadlittle to say about the development.   ``It is our policy not to comment on our competition,'' saidFuji spokeswoman Carol O'Loughlin in New York.   ``Ektar'' is an effort by Kodak to develop a color film that wasconsidered the standard for ``serious amateurs,'' who take about 20percent of the 40 billion pictures made each year worldwide.   ``We're not suggesting that everybody use this film,'' saidWilbur Prezzano, group vice president and general manager ofphotographic products. ``We've got a terrific film for the massmarket,'' he said of Kodacolor Gold, which the company introducedtwo years ago.   In fact, the ``Ektar'' film is not available in the speeds thatare most popular in the general market: 100, 200 and 400. Its twospeeds are 25, which is unusually slow, and 1000, which isunusually fast.   Other speeds may be added to the line, company spokesman RonaldRoberts said.   And Kodak suggests that only owners of 35mm single-lens-reflexcameras use the film. That suggestion is also printed on every boxof ``Ektar'' film.   But it's clear that Kodak believes it has made a significantadvance in the field of color photography because the company hasbroken several long-standing traditions in its effort to sell``Ektar'' film:   _ The film comes in a mostly black box instead of the yellow boxKodak has put all of its film in since about 1903.   _ The film has a new name. Since 1942, Kodak has retained theKodacolor name on new and improved film, choosing to highlightadvancements by adding a number or letter after the name. Ektarwill be sold along with Kodak's Kodacolor Gold line of films.   _ The new film will be 15 to 20 percent more expensive thanKodacolor, which costs about $3.79 for a roll of 24 exposures.   The new film was made possible by several unique discoveries byKodak scientists that improved the performance of color dyes andreduced the number of color layers on the film, the company said.   ``Ektar'' film will be available later this month in Europe andJapan, where Kodak says a majority of the serious amateurphotographers live, and in the United States early next year.   Prezzano said the new film also sends a message to thephotography industry that the old-fashioned, silver-halide methodof making photographs isn't ready to be replaced by electronicphotography.   Stock analyst Mark Obenzinger, of Wood, Gundy andamp; Co. in New York,said Kodak's effort to introduce a premium line of film is a shrewdmarketing measure.   ``They're trying to differentiate themselves from good ol'yellow and I think this is just the beginning of it,'' Obenzingersaid. ``This is another tool for the company in dealing with amaturing market.''</TEXT></DOC>
