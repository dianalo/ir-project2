Hyundai Motor, which is South Korea's main auto maker and is part of the nation's Hyundai industrial group, said that production would resume today at its Ulsan plant.    Union leader Lee Yung Bok told about 10,000 workers assembled at the plant that the union decided to change its tactics and negotiate wage increases after resuming work. About 500 workers at the rally booed the announcement and said they didn't want to resume work until a settlement was reached.    A leader of a hardline union faction said union members would go to the plant today but would refuse to work unless the wage dispute was settled. After Mr. Lee's announcement, management and union resumed talks, but it wasn't known if management would revise its latest offer. Mr. Lee said the auto maker had shown sincerity in recent talks and had ended a lockout at the plant in response to union demands. </TEXT></DOC>
