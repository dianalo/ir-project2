The friendly acquisition will give MCI greater strength inthe midlevel business market as well as access to severalinnovative Telecom products, such as its calling card andvoice-messaging service. Telecom, with 1989 sales of $713million, has been growing 25% to 30% a year, and at the endof last year had a little more than 1% of the $55 billionlong-distance market. MCI, with 1989 revenue of $6.47billion, has about 12% of the market.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This is going to prove to be a powerful combination,&quot;said Lap Lee, a telecommunications analyst for Gordon CapitalInc. Telecom, he said, adds not only new customers but alsoseveral important products, including voice messaging andother enhanced services, that MCI can sell to its existingcustomers and use to attract new business.   With Telecom, MCI will pick up about 450,000 businesscustomers in smaller cities in the South and Midwest. Amongits innovative products is its credit card, which allowsusers to check stock quotes over the phone and set upconference calls. &quot;This strategic alliance and critical masswe pick up will be important as we look to competition overthe next few years,&quot; MCI President Bert Roberts said in aninterview.   Mr. Roberts said the acquisition of Telecom will diluteMCI earnings up to 5% in the first year, but will add toearnings after that. &quot;By the second year, we will havetotally turned the corner,&quot; he said.   The company is financing the acquisition with bank loans,but a spokeswoman said details weren't available. She alsosaid the companies are working on a plan to mesh theirmanagement teams.   The proposed merger sent shares of Telecom soaring andshaved MCI's price by $1.125. In New York Stock ExchangeComposite trading, Telecom closed at $38.125, up $16.25. Inover-the-counter trading, MCI closed at $35.75.   O. Gene Gabbard, chairman and chief executive officer ofTelecom, said the merger announcement is the next step in theindustry's consolidation. &quot;We've seen some 1,000 companiesshrink down to about 200 since 1982,&quot; he said. &quot;Now, we willbegin to see even fewer -- but stronger -- entrants in themarketplace.&quot;   Indeed, some analysts said the merger could accelerate thethree-year industry consolidation -- a result of greaterregulatory freedom for American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. &quot;Ifyou're going to compete against ATandamp;T, the bigger you are, thebetter you are,&quot; said Jack Grubman, an analyst withPaineWebber Inc. With the Federal Communications Commissionpreparing to further loosen regulatory reins on ATandamp;T, Mr.Grubman said, &quot;the competition is going to get tougher, andthe MCI-Telecom USA announcement begs the question: Who'snext?&quot;   The stock market seemed to answer that. The news pushed upshares of some smaller carriers, including AdvancedTelecommunications Corp., which was up $3.25 to $16.75, andRochester Telephone, which has a long-distance division, up$1.125 to $36.875. Analysts also said possible targets foracquisition are Williams Cos., a gas company that hasthreaded fiber-optic cable through abandoned pipeline;Telesphere International, of Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., andInternational Telecharge Inc. of Dallas.   Jim Smith, president of the Competitive TelecommunicationsAssociation, a trade group representing 120 regionallong-distance carriers, said the proposed merger &quot;may bodeill for the future of competition in the long-distanceindustry and for the American public.&quot; Mr. Smith warned thatconsolidation &quot;could accelerate to the point of oligopoly,&quot;leaving customers with little price competition and littleinnovation.   In recent years, MCI's strategy has been to shape thecompany's business to more closely mirror ATandamp;T's. It startedwith a push into the big-business segment, then withincreased emphasis on the international and residentialsegments and now with a merger that gives it a solid block ofmedium-sized business customers.   &quot;There's a market-share war going on,&quot; said Joel Gross, ananalyst with Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette. &quot;It was a buildversus buy decision for MCI, and they decided it was cheaperto buy Telecom USA rather than build up business in themiddle market.&quot;   The MCI-Telecom merger must pass shareholder andregulatory muster, and Mr. Roberts said he hoped to completethe process by midsummer to late summer, but acknowledged theprocess could take longer. The merger requires approval fromTelecom shareholders, the Justice Department under theHart-Scott-Rodino antitrust act, the Federal CommunicationsCommission and from public utilities commissions in stateswhere both MCI and Telecom operate.   An FCC spokeswoman indicated the approval process wouldlast at least six months but could take upward of a year.   Mr. Roberts, who emphasized the friendliness of the mergernegotiations and the similarities in corporate cultures, saidhe anticipated &quot;no major displacement of people&quot; as a resultof the merger. MCI employs 19,500 while Telecom employs5,000. Both Telecom and MCI have reputations asproduct-innovators and strong marketers. Analysts give bothcompanies very high marks for management and cost controls.   Meantime, Standard andamp; Poor's placed MCIstriple-B-plus-rated senior secured debt, triple-Bsubordinated debt and single-A-2 commercial paper on itscredit watch list &quot;with negative implications,&quot; pendingreview of the merger. Sandamp;P said it anticipates a &quot;sharpdeterioration in the capital structure and significantlyhigher fixed charges.&quot; Moody's Investor Service also placedMCI (P) Baa-1 senior debt rating and Prime-2 rating forcommercial paper under review for a possible downgrade.   Several analysts said they were surprised by the mergerannouncement, largely because of Telecom's acquisitivenature. &quot;Quite frankly, we'd gotten used to Telecom playingthe role of the consolidator rather than the object ofconsolidation,&quot; said W. Mark Dunkel, an analyst atRobinson-Humphrey Co.   Telecom, itself the product of a 1988 merger ofSouthernNet Inc., based in Atlanta, and Teleconnect Co. ofCedar Rapids, Iowa, has been on an acquisition binge. Beforethe merger and after, the companies purchased about 30concerns since 1985.   Mr. Gabbard, and the rest of Telecom's officers anddirectors, stand to benefit handsomely from the proposed MCIacquisition, according to the company's latest proxystatement. The officers and directors hold about 30% ofTelecom's common stock outstanding, which at $42 a sharetranslates into about $375 million going to that group.   Analysts said Telecom USA holders benefited from ashareholder-rights plan that allowed them to buy additionalshares at below-market prices in the event of an unwantedtakeover. &quot;In hindsight, it looks like a wise move on {Mr.}Gabbard's part,&quot; said Stephen J. Shook, an analyst atInterstate/Johnson Lane Inc. &quot;It translated into one heck ofa price for Telecom shareholders.&quot;   This year, Telecom stock has traded as low as $15.75 ashare, mainly because of an ill-fated proposal to acquiretroubled ALC Communications Corp. of Birmingham, Mich.Telecom called off discussions with ALC less than a monthafter announcing the deal.   ---                     Can You Hear Me Now?                                                                                                                       1989 U.S. long-distance market                Share of 206.8 billion minutes   Company                               Market Share                                                                                                          MCI                                      14.9%   Telecom USA                               1.6%   US Sprint                                 9.7%   Other                                     7.2%   ATandamp;T                                     66.6%</TEXT></DOC>
