The House on Wednesday approved a $3.7 billion domestic spendingbill that would pour an additional $822 million into thegovernment's anti-drug initiatives in 1989.   The chamber approved the measure 227-197 on a party-line voteafter majority Democrats beat back repeated Republican attempts toreject it.   GOP lawmakers found themselves boxed into voting against beefingup federal drug efforts because the Bush administration opposed themeasure, arguing that it would supply more money than theauthorities need.   House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., called thelegislation and another Democratic anti-drug proposal that wasdefeated ``a two-headed malodorous swamp animal.'' He complainedthat the money in the so-called dire emergency spending bill _intended for drug efforts and other domestic programs _ was ``nomore a dire emergency than the distinguished chairman's drycleaning.''   But Democrats, who argued that the drug problem affectseveryone, prevailed.   ``You can't walk the streets in Washington or any ruralcommunity in safety today,'' said House Appropriations CommitteeChairman Jamie Whitten, D-Miss.   The White House has threatened to veto the measure because ofits anti-drug component.   In a statement delivered to lawmakers Tuesday, the Office ofManagement and Budget noted Bush's desire to battle illegal drugsbut warned, ``This commitment does not mean, though, that thepresident will forgo the war against the deficit.''   The measure now moves to the Senate, where senators haveindicated a desire to tack on their favorite programs. The Senatereturns from its Memorial Day recess on Wednesday.   On a narrow 213-205 tally, the House turned down a separate billchampioned by liberal Democrats that would have siphoned money nextyear from Star Wars research to drug programs. The measure wouldhave frozen spending for the proposed anti-missile defense systemin fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1, to the same $3.7 billion levelof this year. Money provided by Congress above that cap would haveautomatically been transferred to anti-drug initiatives.   The $822 million would be spent for building and modernizingprisons, hiring additional law enforcement officers and otherdrug-related pursuits.   Other funds in the bill include $1.2 billion for veterans, $893million for the Guaranteed Student Loan program for collegestudents, $423 million for state foster care efforts and $88million for public housing.   A $4.7 billion version of the bill failed to garner Houseapproval on April 26, when legislators rejected a Democratic planto pay for the measure by cutting other programs by 0.57 percent.   The House also voted 409-0 to reaffirm its support for aseparate bill providing $1.2 billion for health programs,cost-of-living benefit increases, and other programs for veterans.   The House initially approved that bill last Thursday. That sameevening, the Senate passed the same bill after limiting itsspending to about $75 million, enough to see the Department ofVeterans Affairs through June 15.   By creating a need for a later, second bill to finance thedepartment, the Senate left a vehicle onto which it could attachpet projects of its own.   ``The Senate won't release the veterans as hostages,'' lamentedSilvio Conte of Massachusetts, ranking Republican on the HouseAppropriations Committee.</TEXT></DOC>
