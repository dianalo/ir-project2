The stock has more than doubled to 39 3/4 in the fourmonths since the young biotechnology concern went public at19. The company's market value exceeds $280 millionnot bad,considering that Somatogen doesn't expect to have a producton the market at least until 1995.</LP><TEXT>   If then. The Boulder, Colo., company is engaged in thenoble but daunting task of developing a cheap and puresubstitute for oxygen-carrying components of human blood.Several other companies also are vying to be first in whatsome think could be a $2 billion-a-year market for bloodsubstitutes untainted by the threat of diseases such as AIDS.No matter how good the company's science is, some analystssay, Somatogen stock at these levels holds the potential todisappoint investors because the road to market for ascientific breakthrough is rarely short and straight.   What Somatogen has achieved to date is this: It hastransplanted the human hemoglobin gene into bacteria, and isproducing a genetically engineered human hemoglobin known asrHb1.1, which it hopes can be used for blood transfusions.   Now Somatogen faces two high hurdles. It must crack anobstinate scientific mystery by showing that ahemoglobin-based product can be safely used in humans, whichhas never been done before. The company has just begunlow-dose trials on humans to see if it has solved thatproblem. Then, it must construct one of the largestproduction plants ever built in the young biotech industry,complete with big fermenting and purification processors thatwill resemble silos.   Bulls say the company's top-notch researchers will solvethe safety issue in their first round of human studies. Lastmonth, when federal regulators cleared Somatogen to beginhuman trials of rHb1.1, the stock hit a high of 42 1/2.   The trouble is, hemoglobin-based products have neverbefore been introduced into humans without making bloodvessels constrict, causing shortness of breath, high bloodpressure and other problems. Hopes have been dashed beforewhen several promising products worked in animals, but failedin humans.   &quot;We all thought that hemoglobin would float in thebloodstream without major side effects,&quot; says Col. John Hess,chief of blood research at the U.S. Army's LettermanInstitute of Research in San Francisco. The Army has beenconducting and following research on hemoglobin for 24 years,but Dr. Hess says its effect in the bloodstream may be toxic.&quot;I'm not sure anybody knows whether a human-based hemoglobincan be made safe,&quot; says Dr. Hess, who declines to comment onindividual companies' research.   &quot;There are some very fundamental problems&quot; with hemoglobinstill to be solved, agrees Joseph Fratantoni, chief of theU.S. Food and Drug Administration's laboratory of cellularhematology. &quot;We don't know what we're up against yet,&quot; hesays, adding that the regulators will be closely watchingSomatogen's initial tests on healthy volunteers.   Chief Financial Officer James C.T. Linfield says Somatogenis &quot;very encouraged&quot; by its animal tests. He concedes,however, that &quot;it's not clear what the mechanism is&quot; that ledother products to cause adverse reactions in humans.   If early tests show safety isn't a problem, Somatogen mustspend at least $100 million on a plant to boost capacity by afactor of 33, using three 50,000-liter facilities to purifythe product. The plant is crucial as it must be licensed bythe FDA before Somatogen can begin final product tests.Financing must be lined up for the plant, due to be built byearly 1994. Meanwhile, development costs are growing. AnalystRobert M. Peterson of Hanifen Imhoff Inc. of Denver estimateslosses at about $107 million over the next four years.   Somatogen needs to slash output costs, to compete withcheaper, existing sources of blood. &quot;They seem to have thebest technology so far,&quot; says Tony Sutton, a biotech analystfor Fidelity Investments in Boston, which owns some of thestock. Rivals tackling the problem from different anglesinclude Baxter International; Alliance Pharmaceutical; newlypublic DNX, which is in an even earlier stage of development;Biopure, in which Upjohn has a major investment; and a numberof closely held companies. Mr. Linfield says there are fewfinancing alternatives for companies such as Somatogen thatwant to retain full marketing rights rather than sharepotential profits with a big corporate partner.   Mr. Peterson estimates sales at $270 million and earningsat $7 a share in the fiscal year through mid-1996. Thecompany's investment banker, Alex. Brown andamp; Sons, has a muchhigher fiscal 1996 profit estimate, $12.10 a share. Somatogenwon't discuss the estimates. Much as Mr. Peterson admiresSomatogen's &quot;world-class science,&quot; he recommends waiting tobuy the stock at lower levels.   ---   Somatogen Inc.
