John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican onthe Senate Armed Services Committee, said shortly aftercongressional negotiators adopted the legislation Thursday.   The bill still must be approved by the full House and Senate,and critics were outspoken about a defense blueprint that providesall but $150 million Bush sought for land-based nuclear missilesand restores some funds for conventional weapons the presidentsought to kill.   ``Where a weapon is built and by whom has become more importantthan how much it costs, is it needed and whether it contributes toour national security,'' said Rep. Larry J. Hopkins, R-Ky., amember of the House Armed Services Committee.   ``We're buying too many big-ticket items with no hard choices,''said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, another member of the panel.   The object of their anger was the conferees' decision to providemoney for the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey, the aircraft that takesoff like a helicopter but can fly like a plane, and the Navy'sF-14D Tomcat jet fighter.   The tilt-rotor Osprey, which Bush sought to cancel, will receive$255 million in research and development money but no procurementfunds.   ``This decision will save hundreds of jobs for Philadelphians,''Rep. Tom Foglietta, D-Pa., a member of the House Armed Servicespanel, said in expressing his support for the bill.   The negotiators also agreed to buy 18 F-14Ds in the fiscal yearthat began Oct. 1 but none in fiscal 1991. The legislation alsorequires the manufacturer, Grumman Corp., of New York, to ``sign upfor termination,'' according to Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman ofthe Senate Armed Services Committee.   The debate over the cancellation of the F-14D was the mostcontentious of the nearly eight weeks of debate over the two widelydivergent House and Senate defense bills, lawmakers said.   Warner said that in his 20 years of defense conferences, ``I'venever seen such forceful, if not ruthless, lobbying by somegroups.''   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he was ``generally pleased''with the bill because it provides for ``a strong national defenseand the basic principles of the president's defense budgetrecommendations.''   In a Pentagon statement, Cheney noted the bill ``recognizes thatwe can't afford lower-priority defense programs, such as the V-22aircraft production and, after fiscal year 1990, F-14D aircraftproduction.''   But Cheney expressed some disappointment with the cut in SDI,saying, ``I would have preferred a higher level of funding forSDI.''   The bill provides $3.79 billion for the anti-missile shield,popularly known as Star Wars _ $3.57 billion in Pentagon money and$220 million in Department of Energy dollars.   That represents about $200 million less than the amountearmarked in fiscal 1989 and the first decrease in funds sinceformer President Reagan proposed the program six years ago.   The Star Wars total falls between the $2.8 billion approved bythe House and the $4.3 billion adopted by the Senate.   Nunn said the cut in Star Wars spending reflected thediminishing congressional support for a program the Bushadministration has been unable to define.   The bill also includes:   _About $1.1 billion for the rail-based MX multiple-warheadmissile and the truck-based Midgetman single-warhead, about $150million less than Bush had requested for the two nuclear weapons.Cheney had favored financing only the MX, but Bush opted for both.   _Funds for two B-2 stealth bombers in fiscal 1990, one less thanthe Bush administration proposed, and money for components for fivein fiscal 1991. The bat-winged aircraft has come undercongressional criticism for its expensive price tag of $530 millionapiece.</TEXT></DOC>
