NEW YORK (AP) _ Fourteen Greenpeace members swung on ropesbeneath the Triborough Bridge on Wednesday to protest oceandumping, and tied up traffic on the span and on the East Riverbelow, authorities said.   The demonstrators took to the bridge at 5:45 p.m., danglingabove the East River with their banner reading ``Stop Ocean DumpingNow,'' said Greenpeace spokesman Andrew Davis.   They hoped to block barges carrying sludge for ocean dumping, hesaid. But Tina Casey, spokeswoman for the Department ofEnvironmental Conservation, said no barges were scheduled to departduring the protest.   ``So far, it hasn't affected us at all,'' she said.   The protest forced officials to shut down two westbound lanes ofthe bridge, which links Manhattan and the Bronx with Queens, whileeastbound traffic was at a near standstill due to rubber-necking,authorities said.   After more than five hours, the protesters remained suspendedabout 100 feet above the water, forcing the Coast Guard to stop alltraffic on the waterway from passing under the bridge, said CoastGuard spokesman Joe Gibson.   ``Basically, we're waiting it out,'' said Gibson. ``There's nottoo much we can do.''   It was the second Greenpeace action in as many days aimedagainst the Wards Island Sewage Station.   Davis said the swinging protesters planned to lower themselvesand deny access to any sewage barges leaving the station, which ison the East River island.   On Tuesday, five members of the worldwide ecological group werearrested after they chained a dinghy to the rear of a sewage barge,with a protester chained to a mooring line for the dinghy, policesaid.   That protest delayed the departure of the barge for three hours,authorities said. The barge, one of four operated by the city, washeading to an ocean dumping site 106 miles from New York Harbor.</TEXT></DOC>
