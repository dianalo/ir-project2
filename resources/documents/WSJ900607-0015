The measure, approved last night by a 312-86 vote, wastimed to prod the Bush administration into expanding itsoffer to relax export restrictions on computers,telecommunications equipment and machine tools that the Westcan sell to these countries. The U.S. and 16 of its Europeanand Asian allies are currently meeting in Paris to discusshow they can safely meet the demands of the Soviet Union andits former satellites for Western products and know-how.</LP><TEXT>   The House bill would allow the U.S. to freely sell theSoviet Union and East European countries computers with acapacity of 550 megabits of information per second. Currentrules set a limit of 78 mps. The administration has offeredto raise it to 275 mps, but would allow shipments of morepowerful computers if the purchasing governments promise toguard against unauthorized military use. The legislationwould require the administration to seek the 550 mps level innegotiations with its allies, who would have to ratify anychange.   The higher standard would permit East European nations --and the Soviet Union under some conditions -- to buy someU.S. mainframes as well as practically all personal computersavailable in the West.   While the Bush administration offer stops short of givingEast Europe access to telecommunications systems powered bydigital switching, the House bill would give the West thediscretion of selling even the top-of-the-line systems.   The Bush administration has expressed opposition to thebill, saying that it pre-empts the administration'sauthority. In the Senate, the Banking Committee plans tobegin work soon on its version of the bill.   Before passing the bill last night, the House attachedamendments to withhold certain trade benefits from the SovietUnion and China because of continuing concerns over humanrights in those countries.   Reacting strongly to Soviet attempts to squash Lithuania'smoves towards independence, the House approved an amendmentto deny the Soviets the higher levels of technology untilPresident Bush certifies to Congress that the Soviets haveentered into &quot;serious negotiations&quot; with Lithuania'sduly-elected government and are conducting these talkswithout coercion. The amendment, introduced by Rep. RichardDurbin (D., Ill.) and passed on a 390-24 vote, wouldeffectively freeze current restrictions on the Soviet Union.   Mr. Durbin vowed that the U.S. won't &quot;abandon Lithuania inits efforts for self-determination.&quot;   Signaling its distaste for China's human-rights record,the House approved an amendment that would strip Mr. Bush ofhis discretionary power to allow U.S. owners ofcommunications satellites to buy launch services from China.Rep. Gerald Solomon (R., N.Y.), the amendment's sponsor, tookBeijing to task for failing to make amends for the massacreof democracy marchers in Tiananmen Square a year ago.   Last December, Mr. Bush, invoking a national-securitywaiver from existing sanctions, authorized the shipment ofthree U.S. satellites to be put in orbit by China. However,he would lose such leeway if this provision becomes law. TheSolomon amendment was approved 395-15.   The House bill, a bipartisan effort steered by Rep. SamGejdenson (D., Conn.) and Rep. Toby Roth (R., Wis.), wouldalso create a &quot;license-free zone&quot; for exports among the U.S.and 16 of its cooperating allies. Such a step eliminatelicensing requirements for exports of all but the mostsophisticated equipment, and would rid the U.S. licensingbureaucracy and exporters of one-third of their normalpaperwork.   The bill's &quot;sunset&quot; provisions would automaticallyeliminate export controls on whole categories of commoditiesafter a prescribed period, unless the authorities can justifyreinstating controls on individual items.</TEXT></DOC>
