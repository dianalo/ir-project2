For infected dentists, that essentially means quittingpractice because almost every dental procedure risks cuts where blood can mix.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PATIENTS NEED TO KNOWHEALTH WORKERS WITH AIDS WHO DO SURGERY SHOULDTELL THEIR PATIENTS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Because AIDS is transmitted by blood, medical experts had worried longabout doctor-to-patient transmissions. The fear was confirmed recently whenthe Centers for Disease Control announced that a Florida dentist infectedthree patients with the virus.;    Nobody is sure how it happened. The viruscould have been passed through torn rubber gloves or contaminated instruments.What is certain is that the infection occurred during routine dental visits.It could happen again, a possibility not lost on the American MedicalAssociation and the American Dental Association.;    The two groups quicklyannounced the new policy, which should affect hospital rules, pre-employmentchecks, malpractice insurance and lawsuits. Unfortunately, health workers mayfeel wrongly suspected despite the very low number of health workers confirmedto have AIDS.;    Some may criticize the two health-care associations foracting hastily, for relying only on one case. But the CDC evidence seemsclear: AIDS was transmitted in a dental office. Common sense tells us that notevery dental or medical office with an infected health worker can be madeAIDS-proof. Mistakes in taking precautions will occur in even the mostdiligent offices.;    Urging infected workers to inform patients or quitsurgery was an ethically and medically sound decision.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910123  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  271  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday January 23, 199100023233,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
