The sale leaves RJR Nabisco about $230 million from its goal of$5.5 billion in asset sales for raising cash to reduce thecompany's debt load following its $24.53 billion leveraged buyoutby Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.   The deal with Nestle, a division of Switzerland's giant NestleSA, includes a manufacturing plant in Franklin Park, Ill.   The company began its asset sales program earlier this yearafter Kohlberg Kravis completed its acquisition of the food andtobacco giant. Kohlberg Kravis agreed to sell $5.5 billion inassets in return for financing the deal, the most expensivecorporate takeover ever.   RJR Nabisco earlier sold five European food businesses for $2.5billion; its Chun King division for $52 million; its AssociatedBiscuits International Ltd. for $44 million; Del Monte fresh fruitoperations for $875 million; and Del Monte's canned food businessfor $1.48 billion.   RJR Nabisco Chairman Louis Gerstner has said the company wouldnot sell any more major divisions to reach its goal. Individualproduct lines are considered the most likely sale candidates.   Analysts say RJR Nabisco has negotiated good prices for thedivisions, and will not lose much in operating income because ofthe divestitures.   Nestle produces such well known goods as Nestle chocolate barsand Raisinets candy, Nescafe coffee and Nestle Quik chocolate drinkmixes.</TEXT></DOC>
