It is found that thehydrogenating treatment increases the fatigue life of the alloy and lowersits sensitivity to stress concentration. An electron microscopy examinationshows that the increased fatigue strength of the alloy results from theformation of vacancy clusters, which are eventually transformed to nongrowingmicrovoids. 14 references.</TEXT></DOC>
