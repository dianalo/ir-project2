(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Utility Software Comes Of AgeandM;Utility programs used to be popular only with in-house PC enthusiasts whowould use them to recover accidentally erased files that users had thoughtwere gone forever.andM;No more.andP;  Executives increasingly focused on companywide systems managementare discovering that today's much more powerful utility packages can helpthem better address a wide range of data security issues.andP;  As a result, manyinformation systems and PC managers are beginning to set user standards forthe MS-DOS and Macintosh utilities scattered throughout their organizations.andM;Early utility programs were aimed at data recovery and disk management;software publishers since have broadened their capabilities.andP;  Today's titlesperform functions that run the gamut from simple file formatting andconversion, file and disk management and hard-disk backup, to diskdiagnostics, repair, data recovery and even virus protection.andM;Peter Norton Computing Inc., the makers of Norton Utilities, helped pioneerthe utilities market.andP;  Recently, Norton has been challenged by Central PointSoftware Inc., whose PC Tools Deluxe product tops several best-seller charts.andO;In addition, Symantec Corp. produces two best-selling Macintosh titles:Symantec AntiVirus for the Macintosh (SAM) and Symantec Utilities for theMacintosh (SUM).andP;  At press time, Symantec was completing the acquisition ofPeter Norton Computing, which recently entered the Macintosh niche itselfwith its Norton Utilities for the Macintosh product.andM;Increasingly, users are turning to utility software as a tool for systemsmanagement.andP;  &quot;Systems management on PCs has always been important to Bank ofAmerica,&quot; contends Dick Lowell, manager of office automation evaluation andsupport for the San Francisco-based banking giant.andP;  With about 24,000 PCs,Bank of America is especially concerned about the data security features ofutility software.andP;  Says Lowell: &quot;Corporate policy says every departmentmanager ...andP;  must adhere to Bank of America's security standards.&quot;andP;  Over thelast six months, 15% of the new PCs bought by bank users have been orderedwith copies of the Norton Utilities.andM;Often the most pressing security issue at many companies is simple dataprotection.andP;  As more users and PC managers become aware of the mortality ofhard disks--the mean time between hard disk failures is usually between twoand three years--utilities surface as the most convenient way to get users toback up their drives onto floppies or tape.andM;Feeling SecureandM;To ensure that backups happen on a regular basis, some corporations installautomatic disk backup protection on new PCs before they are distributed tousers.andP;  The reason: users are less likely to tamper with the original PCconfiguration and are more likely to feel comfortable with backup from thestart.andP;  Popular programs such as PC Tools and FastBack Plus, a backup packagefrom Fifth Generation Systems Inc., are considered a necessity at manycorporations because they drastically reduce the time ordinarily required tobackup data to floppies.andP;  &quot;Most people don't back up their PCs because of thetime it takes and amount of media [disks] required,&quot; says Steve Hess,executive vice president at Creative Strategies Research International, aSanta Clara consulting firm.andM;The usefulness of these products extends far beyond data backup, however.andO;The well-publicized dangers of computer viruses have focused attention on theneed for stricter PC protection and better maintenance as a whole.andO;&quot;Antivirus protection is considered a must, and it's certainly one of themore publicized facets of utility software, especially on the Mac side,&quot; saysLee Lensky, Symantec's director of Macintosh utilities.andM;The Need For Corporate StandardsandM;Software publishers credit the increased publicity over viruses and otherdata disasters for bringing more corporate buyers into a market once centeredaround individual, more technically astute users.andP;  When over 200 peoplerecently attended a utilities seminar sponsored by Software Spectrum ofDallas, one of the nation's largest software reseller firms, two noteworthytrends surfaced.andP;  &quot;At least half of the PC managers had never used utilityapplications before but were trying to establish a [corporate] standardslist,&quot; says Rose Hultgren, Software Spectrum marketing manager.andP;  Second, thetitles of the corporate users in attendance--including PC manager, LANadministrator and service relations manager--supports the notion thatcorporations are now relying on utilities to help manage PC support.andM;&quot;We see in utilities good tools for support people but not necessarily foreveryday users,&quot; says Steve Birgfield, manager of Martin Marietta Corp.'smicro products center in Chantilly, Va.andP;  Birgfield, who oversees productevaluation and selection of approved standards, sees multiple standardsemerging at Martin Marietta.andP;  &quot;Our current standard is Norton, but we aregoing to rethink the whole area of utilities in the third or fourth quarterfor both Macs and PCs,&quot; he says.andM;With 24,000 personal computers in use, the aerospace giant is dealing with afast-growing population of Macintoshes and wants to articulate a Mac standardsoon.andP;  Meanwhile, Birgfield says, his company uses several basic featuresfound in the Norton Utilities and Central Point Software's PC Tools productfor its PCs.andP;  Martin Marietta is primarily interested in the data protectionin products like these, he says, because they enable administrators topreconfigure large numbers of PCs with utilities that can prevent users frominadvertently losing precious data.andM;The Network AdvantageandM;Martin Marietta's use of utilities to guard against user mistakes is hardlyunique.andP;  &quot;Traditionally, an IS manager's perspective was that of aprotectionist trying to limit technology available to individual PC users.andO;To a certain extent, that's still true with utilities,&quot; admits Corey Smith,Central Point Software's president.andP;  For PC managers reluctant to distributeutility software on a corporatewide basis, network-supported products like PCTools Deluxe and Norton Utilities version 5.0 give network administrators theability to restrict user access to selected features.andP;  For example, theability to wipe clean an entire disk can be distributed to only a few userson a network, whereas a hard disk backup feature might be made available toeveryone.andM;A number of lesser known utility packages are designed especially for networkuse.andP;  Ashton-Tate Corp.'s Control Room product is a good example of what'sneeded, say users.andP;  Control Room has a feature that allows network managersto analyze who is on the network and note any deviations from the initialsetup.andM;The addition of network support to popular utility packages is just one ofthe more recent developments in a market increasingly marked by feature warsbetween the industry leaders.andP;  Where utility packages once provided only oneor two functions, today's generation takes the Swiss Army knife approach.andO;Central Point Software's PC Tools Deluxe 6.0, for example, includes diskbackup, a DOS SHELL, file manager, desktop organizer, and fax and phonecommunications all in one.andP;  PC Tools' competitor, Norton Utilities version5.0, offers a comparable bevy of features, including data recovery, aspreadsheet and database file fixer, data encryption and automatic diskoptimization and repair.andP;  Central Point Software is also shipping a MacToolsDeluxe program for the Macintosh and plans a Windows version in early 1991.andM;In addition to their increased functionality, utilities are appearing on moreapproved software lists because they are becoming easier to use.andP;  The newNorton Utilities, version 5.0, for example, uses pull-down menus, works wellwith a mouse and no longer forces users to remember a litany of arcanecommands.andP;  In a world where PC management is stretched thin, anything thathelps users help themselves or managers better manage their own resources iswelcome.andP;  Says Central Point Software's Corey: &quot;Reduction in [available] ISsupport is a key element of the market dynamics.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
