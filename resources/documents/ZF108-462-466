(products).andO;Product:   Double Helix II 3.0 (Data base management system).andO;Topic:     Data Base Management SystemsSoftware PackagesEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Odesta Corp.andM;DOUBLE HELIX II 3.0andM;Double Helix II is a unique non-procedural database that contains noprogramming language, but instead uses object-oriented icons for fields,data-entry design, table lists and so on.andP;  It uses a visual interface andobject-oriented icons to build powerful database applications, allowingprogrammers to dispense with writing programming code in the design mode.andM;Developers can easily create customized applications by dragging icons fromicon wells into the development window and then opening the icon.andP;  Developerscan then structure a database application using a large collection of toolsto create calculations on fields, to sequence operations (macros) and toreport form views.andP;  Although this approach to database applicationsdevelopment breaks from tradition, it works well.andM;Double Helix's query function allows developers to decide which reportwindows will be automatically updated when data changes.andM;When creating complex database structures, developers need to keep track ofprecisely what their application does.andP;  One of Double Helix's most valuablefeatures can print a report detailing an application's structure as it isbeing built.andM;Double Helix requires at least a Mac Plus with 1M byte of RAM and a harddisk.andM;Odesta Corp. can be reached in Northbrook, Ill., at (800) 323-5423.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;Ted Sudol, network manager for The New York Times, chose Double Helix becauseof its fast applications-development time, &quot;and, as you go along, it can beeasily modified,&quot; he said.andP;  He also chose it for VAX compatibility.andM;Learning the product's icon-based development method was &quot;at first verydisconcerting,&quot; said Sudol, because it is so unlike any other product.andP;  &quot;Butonce you have experience, you can develop applications very quickly,&quot; hesaid.andM;The import/export functions are quick to set up and flexible, he added.andM;The only problem with Double Helix, Sudol said, is &quot;its inability to build alibrary of procedures to use in building other applications.&quot;andM;Martin Ogletree, section head of pharmacology at the Squibb Institute forMedical Research in Princeton, N.J., likes Double Helix's icon-basedstructure, but learning the system requires a commitment to understanding theproduct's unusual approach to relational databases, he said.andM;The flexibility of ad hoc queries has &quot;improved with recent upgrades,&quot;Ogletree observed.andM;The report generator could use more features, according to Ogletree.andP;  &quot;I'dlike to be able to write in subscripts and superscripts, and it's justimpossible to produce something and show it as is, rather than to have toimport it into Microsoft Word,&quot; he said.andM;According to Nantucket Corp. and Borland International Corp., their Mac-baseddatabase-management system products -- McMax 2.0 and Reflex Plus 1.0.1,respectively -- are not &quot;officially&quot; in release.andP;  However, a few quick phonecalls around the country revealed that both products are still sitting onsome distributors' shelves.andM;Buyers should be told about these products.andM;Reflex Plus, which is about two years old, is a relational database thatshows its age.andP;  It has no procedural language or run-time capability.andP;  Itlacks custom menus, dialogue boxes and graphic fields.andP;  It has no securityprovisions or data-recovery abilities, and it is not a multiuser program.andM;However, the $279 Reflex Plus is the only Mac relational database that'ssmall enough to run on a Macintosh 512 with one 800K-byte floppy-disk drive,and may be suitable for users with very simple database needs.andM;The product's documentation is complete and thorough, and it comes with agood tutorial.andM;The program automatically creates screens for data entry, and although customforms can be designed, no built-in drawing tools are provided.andP;  Users mustimport graphics via the clipboard, and the graphics must remain in thebackground; data fields may be placed on top of them.andM;Relationships between files are set by linking the files through a key fieldcreated expressly for this purpose.andP;  Reflex Plus requires every database tocontain a unique key or set of key fields, and then uses the link field toidentify another record by its key only.andM;Because reports aren't linked to the actual data, only the template of thereport is saved to disk.andP;  When the user quits the program, the information inthe report will be gone.andP;  To save the report on disk, the user must export itto another application and then import it back into Reflex Plus.andP;  Reflex Plusdoesn't display in its entry forms how many records have been selected or howmany are in the database as a whole.andP;  A calculated field is needed to displaythat information.andM;Version 2.0 of McMax ($295), which has been on the market for a year and ahalf, looks like a PC application on the Mac, right down to the on-screendBASE-like dot prompt.andP;  Further, McMax ignores the use of color, pictures andfont styles.andM;Similar to its PC cousin, Clipper, McMax 2.0 can read and write dBASE IIIPlus data and program files.andP;  Most dBASE III Plus programs can be ported fromthe PC to the Mac with some modification.andM;Although McMax 2.0 can transfer dBASE files from the PC to the Mac, it's nota good development environment for Mac developers: They must be familiar withthe dBASE programming language to create McMax applications.andM;Although dBASE programming techniques are covered in the manual, the absenceof an index makes learning and using McMax an exercise in frustration.andM;McMax is also hampered by the lack of a forms generator, meaning thatdata-entry forms must be programmed in the columnar fashion of dBASE.andP;  Thisapproach is primitive when compared with 4th Dimension or Double Helix, whichuse object-oriented forms generators.andM;McMax comes with a built-in source-code debugger, a text editor and anencryptor for source-code protection.andM;McMax 2.0 doesn't have a compiler like its PC-based counterpart, Clipper, butdoes include a run-time module that requires no additional licensing orroyalty fees.andP;  It also comes with a variation on the menu-driven dBASE IIIPlus Assistant, called Assist, which can speed up programming tasks.andP;  -- HerbBethoneyandM;Although PC Week did not test the reviewed Macintosh-baseddatabase-management systems on a network, Blythe Software Inc.'s Omnis 5,Odesta Corp.'s Double Helix II, and Acius' 4th Dimension and FileForce comewith built-in multiuser capabilities.andM;Users of Fox Software Inc.'s FoxBASE+/Mac can buy an optional product,Multiuser FoxBASE+/Mac, at an upgrade price of $200, or $695 if purchasedseparately.andM;All of the multiuser databases will work on AppleTalk or EtherTalk LANs withlittle or no modification of any database application.andM;Since Omnis 5 and FoxBASE+/Mac have PC-based versions, they can share dataacross the two platforms.andM;Double Helix II comes in a VAX/VMS version, called Helix VMS.andP;  Also, Macusers can develop applications with Double Helix II and port them to a VAXsystem running running Helix VAX.andP;  It is the only Mac-baseddatabase-management system currently able to do this.andM;Oracle for Macintosh brings Structured Query Language (SQL) capabilities tothe Mac, allowing users to access Oracle databases on minis and mainframes.andM;Omnis 5, 4th Dimension and FileForce have SQL links for both Oracle databasesand Apple Computer Inc.'s CL/1 connectivity software (an enhancement of SQL),and can serve as front ends for SQL or CL/1 databases running on a host.andM;Security FeaturesandM;Controlling user access to sensitive data is important in a networkenvironment, and 4th Dimension, FileForce, Double Helix II and Omnis 5 havepassword capabilities that provide data security and file-locking features.andM;File locking prevents the corruption of data that can occur when one usermodifies a record while another user simultaneously updates the same record.andM;Omnis 5, Double Helix II and FoxBASE+/Mac will automatically lock a record asit is being modified; 4th Dimension and FileForce, on the other hand, lockthe whole file if a record is being modified, resulting in much slowertransactions on the network.andM;Acius will provide automatic single-record locking in its upgrades to 4thDimension and FileForce, due to be released in June.andM;-- Herb Bethoney</TEXT></DOC>
