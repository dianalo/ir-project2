Only nine months ago, Tel Aviv University's Jaffa Centerfor Strategic Studies estimated that Iraq was &quot;five to 10years&quot; from obtaining the bomb, with Iraqi progress in thisarea constituting &quot;a new level of the military threat&quot;hovering over the region. The U.S. intelligence communityagreed. But shortly before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, thePentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency broke ranks andrevised its estimate downward. Iraq was now only &quot;two to fiveyears&quot; away from a nuclear capability, the DIA said.</LP><TEXT>   France, which has closely monitored Iraq's nuclearprograms as one of its principal suppliers for many years,has revised its estimate as well. In recent interviews,French officials said they believed Iraq could &quot;go nuclear&quot;in three years or more. One of their biggest worries is thatthese facilities are so small that even the bestreconnaissance satellites might never pick them up, officialssaid.   Iraq's nuclear research program began in the early 1960s,when the first Baathist government purchased an experimentalnuclear reactor from the U.S.S.R. To house the modest-sizedplant, Iraq built its first nuclear research center, some 15miles south of Baghdad. Later, the Soviets upgraded thislight-water research reactor and trained at least 100 Iraqinuclear physicists. They also delivered three &quot;hot cells&quot;capable of manipulating spent fuel, and built a laboratorycapable of producing medical radio-isotopes. But LeonidBrezhnev refused subsequent Iraqi pleas to purchase moreadvanced technology, and Iraq turned to France.   In September 1975, Saddam met with Prime Minister JacquesChirac in Paris, to negotiate a wide range of arms-for-oildeals. Among them was the purchase of two nuclear researchreactors. To the French, Saddam said he was interested incivilian nuclear power. But in an interview with a Beirutmagazine, El Usbou el-Arabi, he described the agreement withFrance as &quot;the first concrete step toward the production ofthe Arabic atomic weapon.&quot;   The contract to purchase the Osiris and Isis reactors(later designated as &quot;Tammouz I&quot; and &quot;Tammouz II&quot;) was signedin Baghdad two months later. These deliveries, coupled withthe sale by Italy in 1980 of four hot cells capable ofextracting weapons-grade plutonium from spent reactor fuel,were considered so critical that in June 1981 Israel sent inair force jets, which totally destroyed the core of theTammouz I reactor. Tammouz II, which was a scale model fornuclear experiments, emerged intact and today appears to beoperational.   Repeated attempts to convince the French to rebuildTammouz I have failed. And yet, Iraq continues its nuclearweapons program unabated. Only now, these efforts areoccurring underground.   At first, in the 1970s and early 1980s, the Iraqis builtlarge-scale nuclear plants capable of irradiating highlyenriched uranium, which could then be reprocessed in hotcells to obtain weapons-grade plutonium. But not only werethe nuclear materials and equipment Iraq purchased subject toInternational Atomic Energy Agency inspections, whichoccurred every six months, but the installations themselveswere large, easy to identify, and difficult to defend.   In 1983, Iraqi nuclear engineers changed tactics. Using aclandestine technology-procurement network in Europe, Africaand the Americas, they set about acquiring criticaltechnologies needed to build an indigenous uranium-enrichmentindustry, based on gas centrifuges.   This method involves turning large quantities of uraniumyellowcake into a gas, called uranium hexofluoride, andspinning the gas in specially designed ultracentrifuges untilthe desired level of purification can be obtained. Uraniumthus enriched to more than 90% can then be directly used tobuild atomic weapons.   Ultracentrifuge technology may be complex, but it iswidely available and relatively easy to conceal. Pakistanseems to have taken this route; China mastered it; Brazilopened its own ultracentrifuge enrichment plant two yearsago, using West German technology. All of these countries mayhave contributed to the Iraqi program. And there is littlethe IAEA or anyone else can do about it. These areclandestine facilities, fueled by vast quantities ofunsafeguarded uranium yellowcake obtained from Niger, Braziland Portugal in the late 1970s, and extracted from Iraq's ownplant at al Qaim in recent years.   Several warning lights have appeared recently, providing adisturbing glimpse into Iraq's clandestine nuclear program:   -- In March, British and American customs agentscoordinated to intercept 40 krytron nuclear triggers on theirway to Iraq. Krytrons are essential for detonating a nucleardevice.   -- In July, in another joint British-American operation,high-temperature &quot;skull furnaces&quot; manufactured by ConsarcEngineering, in Rancocas, N.J., were intercepted on their wayto Iraq. These furnaces can be used both for nuclear andballistic missile programs.   -- In August, the Swiss firm Schmiedemeccanica tried todeliver endcaps made of special maraging steel to Iraq.Endcaps are a critical part of ultracentrifuges.   -- Since 1987, a West German engineering firm, Handamp;HMetalform, has been delivering to Iraq sophisticatedmachine-tools capable of making ultracentrifuges in Iraq,according to the German newsweekly Der Spiegel. Inconjunction with this crucial sale, which was never blocked,Iraq has also purchased from West German andFrench-controlled companies large quantities of the specialsteels needed to manufacture the centrifuges.   West European nuclear experts have little doubt: Iraq hasopted for the centrifuge technique, and the spate of recentpurchases proves Iraq's intentions.   But even government nuclear experts admit they do not knowthe full scope of the Iraqi purchases. &quot;We see things gettingstopped, but we have no idea how much of it is actuallygetting through,&quot; one French expert said. &quot;We know the Iraqisare masters of clandestine procurement, and they have anextremely detailed shopping list. We see the pattern in theirpurchases, but we can't see the timetable. They seem to bebuying whatever they can find whenever it becomes available.&quot;   Iraq surprised the world once, in the development of itsindigenous ballistic missiles. Clearly, with his nuclearambitions, Saddam would like to surprise us again.   ---   Mr. Timmerman edits Mednews, a Paris-based newsletter onMiddle East defense issues.</TEXT></DOC>
