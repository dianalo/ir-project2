Opposition parties suspended their campaigns anddemanded postponement of the May election.   Bernardo Jaramillo was shot point-blank Thursday at Bogota'sairport. Police blamed drug traffickers.   Drug traffickers killed the governing party's presidentialhopeful, Luis Carlos Galan, in August, sparking a bloody warbetween the government and drug lords.   ``The right to life has disappeared completely,'' theConservative Party candidate, Rodrigo Lloreda, told reporters lateFriday at a news conference. ``The government is not even providingthat minimum guarantee.''   The Conservative Party, the country's main opposition, joinedJaramillo's Patriotic Union and other leftist parties late Fridayin suspending their campaigns.   They demanded that President Virgilio Barco postpone the May 27presidential election and provide additional security forcandidates. The communique from the opposition parties did notsuggest a new date for elections.   Barco, of the governing Liberal Party, did not respond to thedemands. The party's leader in the House of Representatives,Norberto Morales, said the election should take place on the dateprescribed by law.   Jaramillo's body was carried from the Capitol building toBogota's main cemetery Saturday in a symbolic funeral. He will beburied Sunday in his hometown of Manizales, 120 miles northwest ofBogota.   Radio reports said some 20,000 people, many of them crying andwaving white handkerchiefs, lined the streets.   Several small explosions intended to cause panic occurred duringthe ceremony, but authorities controlled the situation using riotpolice and armored cars, said police spokesman Luis Enrique Avila.No injuries were reported.   The Liberal Party put off its Saturday convention until afterJaramillo's burial.   The governing party is expected to ratify as its candidate CesarGaviria, who won a March 11 primary. By law, Barco cannot run forre-election.   Colombia's intellegence police said their investigations hadshown that the leader of the Medellin cocaine cartel, PabloEscobar, ordered Jaramillo killed. Escobar denied the charge in aletter Friday to the Patriotic Union.   Diego Montana, president of the Patriotic Union, repeated hissuggestion that the government was indirectly responsible forJaramillo's death.   ``I don't know how a government that permits the elimination ofthe opposition can call itself Liberal,'' he said during a jointnews conference with Lloreda.   Disturbances broke out Thursday almost immediately afterJaramillo's death. One soldier was killed by a sniper and sixpolice officers were wounded before the street fighting wascontrolled early Friday, Avila said.   The government has repeatedly denied the Patriotic Union'saccusations that military forces have carried out an exterminationcampaign against the party. Assassins have killed 1,044 of itsmembers in the last four years.   Police investigations have held that most of the assassinationswere perpetrated by hitmen working for drug traffickers.   The communique from the opposition parties said foreignobservors should oversee the electoral process in Colombia. Thedocument was also signed by the Communist Party, the SocialistWorkers' Party and the April 19 Movement, a former guerrilla groupthat laid down its arms earlier this month.</TEXT></DOC>
