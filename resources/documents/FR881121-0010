It will not result in an annual effecton the economy of $100 million or more; a major increase in costs or pricesfor consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local governmentagencies, or geographic regions; or significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of UnitedStates-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domesticor export markets.The principal effect of this final rule is to establish a new inspectionsystem for broilers and cornish game hens in response to increased demandson Agency resources. It provides FSIS and the poultry industry with aninspection procedure that meets the requirements for inspection withinavailable resources.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effect on Small Entities</ITAG>The Administrator, FSIS, has determined that this final rule will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesas defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-354 (5 U.S.C.601). Certain changes in plant facilities are required of establishmentsthat operate under SIS; however, these changes, which were published inthe October 21, 1987, issue of the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>will result only in minor expenditures. Theindustry will realize some gains through reduced charges for overtime inspectionbecause there will be fewer inspectors per line, reduced workspace requirementsfor inspection teams, and increased productivity by maintaining optimalline speeds.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) (21 U.S.C. 451 <T3>et seq.</T3>) requires, among other things, that the Secretary of Agriculture,through appointed inspectors, conduct a post-mortem inspection of the carcassof each bird processed in every official establishment that processes poultryfor commerce or that is otherwise subject to the Act and condemn all productfound to be adulterated. The post-mortem inspection is performed by veterinariansor trained food inspectors under veterinary supervision. Working at a movingproduction line, inspectors view the exterior, interior, and viscera (internalorgans) of each bird slaughtered for the purpose of detecting disease orother conditions that might render the carcass or any part thereof unfitfor human food or otherwise adulterated. In carrying out the examination,the inspectors follow standardized inspection procedures and initiate actionsconsistent with their findings. The procedures are designed to assure thatonly wholesome and unadulterated carcasses and carcass parts are passedfor human food.Post-mortem inspection of livestock and poultry accounts for the largestportion of the Department's expenditures for meat and poultry inspection.Therefore, use of the most efficient and effective post-mortem inspectionprocedures and staffing standards is essential to minimizing costs whileprotecting the public health.The responsibility of the Department to make the most efficient use ofits resources is now more important than ever because FSIS's resourcesare decreasing at the same time that demands for inspection services havebeen increasing. On September 19, 1985, a hiring freeze on permanent full-time(PFT) employment by FSIS was ordered to reflect a fiscal year (FY) 1986operating budget that was less than necessary to support current employment.In addition to freezing PFT employment, the hiring freeze restricted theconversion of temporary, intermittent, or part-time employees to PFT status.Also, use of part-time and other employment was held at 1985 levels. Personnelactions that involved moving employees between major program areas, fromthe field to headquarters, and from line to staff positions were also frozen.On November 15, 1985, FSIS found it necessary to order additional cost-savingmeasures beyond those then in place to be able to operate within availablefunding levels. These measures included a continuation of the freeze onPFT employment, a one-third reduction in non-inspection-related travel,suspension of all non-technical training, and reductions in various contracts.All other costs were limited to the 1986 base level or below (1985 levelless any non-recurring activities). FSIS's funding level necessitated acontinuation of the hiring freeze and consequent reduction in employment.This reduction was influenced by such economic factors as inflation andrising employee benefit costs. However, even if FSIS were able to maintainthe previous year's employment level, it would still have been unable tomeet the rising industry demands for inspection service.Besides the budget short fall, the Agency faces long-term constraints onits operations. The passage of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Balanced BudgetAmendment of 1985 makes it likely that FSIS will be compelled to economizemuch further in the coming years. Appropriations for FY 1986 were subjectto reductions of 4.3 percent to meet the requirements of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings,and increasingly larger cuts are mandated for the following fiscal years.FSIS spends about 85 percent of its operating budget on employee salariesand benefits. This makes it impossible to absorb funding reductions oraccommodate increased costs except through personnel reductions. The greatmajority of FSIS staff are field inspectors and veterinarians. Thus, anybudgetary reductions are almost immediately felt in day-to-day inspectionoperations.Even though FSIS continues to operate under certain budgetary constraints,it must fulfill its responsibilities under the law. A House-Senate Conferencedeliberating on one of the Continuing Resolutions recently took the positionthat ``in administering the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the PoultryProducts Inspection Act, the Administrator of FSIS is expected to takewhatever action is necessary to ensure that requests for inspection servicerequired by law are promptly accommodated. On-site inspection should receivepriority over some other Agency functions''.At the same time that the Agency has been confronted with new budgetarylimits, the poultry industry has been demanding increased inspection service.The operators of federally inspected poultry processing establishmentshave requested inspectional coverage for new production lines and expandedoperations. Many establishments that have previously operated single-workingshifts have expanded to two shifts or are planning to do so in the nearfuture. The growth of the poultry products industry is accelerating. Productionin FY 1985 was increased 5.5 percent over production in FY 1984 and increasedby a similar percentage in FY 1986. In terms of per capita consumption,poultry is now second only to beef among all meat and poultry food products.To accommodate the demands of increasing consumption and production andto absorb workforce reductions without denying inspection service, FSIStook immediate action to revise its poultry inspection procedures. On January29, 1986, FSIS published an interim rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 3569) establishing the ``Streamlined InspectionSystem'' (SIS), a new post-mortem inspection system to be implemented inestablishments that slaughter broilers and cornish game hens. These establishmentsconstitute the largest section of the poultry industry in terms of output.The revision of inspection procedures in these establishments enabled FSISto shift qualified inspection personnel to areas where their services weremore efficiently and productively employed. This change became possiblenot merely because of the exigencies of present and future budgets, butbecause of the experience FSIS has gained over recent years in operatingseveral types of poultry inspection systems.Prior to the interim rule, there were three systems used for the inspectionof broilers and cornish game hens, namely traditional inspection, modifiedtraditional inspection, and the ``New Line Speed'' (NELS) inspection system.Also, a New Turkey Inspection (NTI) system was implemented in turkey slaughterestablishments. SIS is a new method that has been developed on the basisof experience gained in operating the previous inspection systems.A. Traditional InspectionUnder traditional inspection, one inspector examines a whole bird and isresponsible for the proper disposition of the bird, including the identificationand verification of any required trimming, before it leaves the inspectionstation. Traditional inspection was satisfactory to FSIS and the poultryindustry for many years and is still performed in some slaughter establishments.B. Modified Traditional Inspection (MTI)In the middle 1970's, the development of automated evisceration equipment,as well as improvements in genetics, nutrition, health, and flock management,allowed the poultry industry to present uniform lots of birds to inspectorsfaster than inspectors could properly inspect the birds under the traditionalmethods. Therefore, a new inspection procedure known as ``Modified TraditionalInspection'' was developed in 1978 which allowed better use of inspectionresources and permitted the poultry industry to take advantage of thesenew technologies and production improvements. MTI allowed industry to runan eviscerating line at speeds of up to 70 birds per minute.MTI reduced the number of motions required for each of three inspectorson the line by splitting post-mortem inspection into two functional tasks.One task (performed by one inspector) was the outside inspection of eachuneviscerated prepositioned carcass, using a mirror to observe surfacesnot directly visible. The second task (performed by two inspectors), inside/viscerainspection, was performed after the bird was eviscerated and establishmentpersonnel repositioned the carcass and its attached viscera. The trimmingof carcass defects was performed by establishment employees, known as helpersor trimmers, who were positioned next to and acted under the directionof the inspectors.C. New Line Speed (NELS) Inspection SystemAfter the implementation of MTI, the poultry industry continued to makesignificant technological advances. Consequently, many establishments wereable to present uniform lots of birds to inspectors faster than the 70birds per minute allowed with MTI. This advance was made possible by improvedautomated equipment and better control of the production process. In theseestablishments, the inspection process again became a limiting factor inestablishment productivity and restricted the return-on-investment forthe development and installation of modern, innovative equipment and facilities.It became apparent to the Agency that these restraints could not be overcomethrough expanded use of MTI. Also, various studies had shown that Federalinspection was more efficient and effective in establishments where qualitycontrol was emphasized.Establishments without the facilities, personnel, or procedures necessaryto ensure the highest practicable degree of quality control sometimes tendedto rely on Federal inspection as a substitute for the proper control oftheir own operations. In those establishments, Federal inspectors weresometimes placed in a burdensome, quasi-supervisory role not appropriateunder the PPIA.The NELS system eliminated much of the need for post-mortem inspectorsto act in such a role. It required that participating establishments haveand maintain good control of their facilities, personnel, and processingprocedures, as spelled out in a written partial quality control agreementwith FSIS. This agreement assures the inspector-in-charge that all functionscritical to the processing of an acceptable product are being effectivelyperformed by the establishment.The NELS inspection system uses three post-mortem inspectors on each eviscreatingline. Each inspects the outside (with the aid of a mirror), the inside,and the viscera of every third bird presented. The inspectors determinewhether the birds should be condemned, salvaged, retained for dispositionby a veterinarian, reprocessed, or permitted to move down the line as apassed bird subject to trim and reinspection. After post-mortem inspectionis completed at the inspection station, establishment employees performany necessary trim on all passed carcasses after the giblets are harvested.The complete NELS inspection system consists of three inspectors performingthe NELS inspection procedure and one inspector monitoring the applicationof an approved partial quality control (PQC) program designed to assurethat the production process is under control and producing acceptable product.This program_the Poultry Carcass On-Line Quality Control (PCOLQC) Program_isa statistically based sampling system designed to assure the control ofan establishment's processing operations. It is the basis for the approvalof the use of the NELS inspection system in any establishment.The maximum line speed achievable under NELS is 91 birds per minute. Thisspeed may be reached when all plant conditions are optimal. The inspector-in-chargeis responsible for reducing the line speed when, in his or her judgment,the existing NELS system does not permit adequate inspection because thebirds are not presented properly or the health conditions of a particularflock dictate a need for a more extended inspection procedure.D. New Turkey Inspection (NTI) System For many years, the traditional inspection procedure was the only inspectionprocedure available to turkey processors, and was satisfactory to bothFSIS and the turkey industry. As in the traditional procedure applied tobroilers and cornish game hens, traditional turkey inspection involvedthe examination of the whole bird by one inspector who was responsiblefor proper disposition of the bird, including the identification and verificationof any required trim, before the bird left the inspection station. In thelast several years, the turkey industry has grown and matured to the pointthat merely expanding the use of the traditional inspection procedure wouldbe impractical, inefficient, and place demands on resources that wouldbe difficult for the Agency to meet. Therefore, in September of 1985, FSISestablished the NTI system. As in NELS, the NTI system places upon establishments the responsibilityof developing and maintaining good control of their facilities, personnel,and processing procedures. A written partial quality control program, approvedby FSIS assures the inspector-in-charge that critical processing functionsare being effectively performed by the establishment. Depending on requiredplant line speeds, the NTI system requires one or two inspectors on eacheviscerating line. The inspector inspects the outside, inside, and visceraof every bird presented. The inspector determines whether the bird shouldbe condemned, salvaged, retained for disposition by a veterinarian, reprocessedor permitted to move down the line as a passed bird subject to trim andreinspection. After post-mortem inspection has been completed at the inspection station(s),establishment employees perform any necessary outside trim on all passedcarcasses after the giblets are harvested. Under traditional inspection,the inspector is responsible for identifying those carcases that must betrimmed, directing the establishment employee to trim the defects, andverifying that the bird has been properly trimmed. However, NTI shiftsthe responsibility of performing specific outside trim to the establishmentemployees. The complete NTI system is like NELS in that it consists of one or twoinspectors performing whole bird inspection, and one inspector monitoringthe application of an approved PQC program to assure that the program isbeing followed. As in NELS, an acceptable PCOLQC program is the basis forapproving use of the NTI system in any establishment. Under NTI, FSIS inspectorsare responsible for inspecting the carcasses, monitoring the establishment'sapplication of the PQC program, and conducting regular verification andevaluation sampling and observations to assure that the establishment'sdata are accurate and truthful, thus assuring that the ready-to-cook poultryconforms to all applicable regulatory requirements. The NELS and NTI systems were subject to effectiveness studies comparingthem with previously existing inspection procedures. NELS was operationallytested in three establishments and compared with both MTI and traditionalinspection. Similarly, effectiveness studies to test the NTI system andcompare it with the traditional inspection procedure were conducted inthree establishments. The effectiveness test results indicated that therewere no significant differences between NELS, MTI, and traditional inspectionfor broilers and cornish game hens, or between NTI and traditional inspectionfor turkeys. The NELS and NTI systems represent notable advances in the developmentof efficient, scientifically-based inspection systems. The tests conductedon these systems were the most exhaustive ever performed on new inspectionprocedures. The valuable lessons gained from the development and applicationof the systems have enabled FSIS to prepare for future inspection systemsthat will rely extensively on automated equipment and the analysis of computerizeddata for objective monitoring of inspection performance and the incidenceof carcass defects and disease conditions. Moreover, the experience gainedby FSIS in operating NELS and NTI has provided the basis for developingSIS. <ITAG tagnum="84">Development of SIS </ITAG>Since the inception of NELS and NTI, top FSIS veterinarians and technicalspecialists have devoted many hours to the analysis of work measurementstudies, disposition data, and other information from tests of the systemsand from inplant operations. The specialists found that a new sequenceof hand-eye movements would provide the most efficient and effective inspectionprocedures. The analysis of technical information from the NELS and NTI tests, includingthe new work measurement findings, enabled FSIS to begin preliminary workon a two-inspector NELS system in May 1984. Since that time, FSIS has exploredother one- and two-inspector procedures. Work measurement studies on thetwo-inspector NELS procedure were begun last year and were carried outover several months. On the basis of these studies, FSIS informed the broilerindustry of the potential availability of one- or two-inspector NELS systems.The implementation of these systems would have permitted additional establishmentsoperating under the older MTI procedure to convert to the NELS system.In addition to permitting increased productivity in the poultry industry,FSIS would be able to fulfill its inspection responsibilities in a moreuniform manner within NELS establishments and from establishment to establishment.The two-inspector NELS system was not formally proposed or implementedbecause of a few unresolved problems in establishing uniform approachesto inspection in various settings. Also, during the short time in whichthe system had been under development, there had been no opportunity todemonstrate the two-inspector system under operational conditions. Nevertheless, the experience gained in developing this system enabled FSISto conceive an innovative approach to poultry inspection. Rather than beingimplemented in the NELS setting, however, SIS was applied in MTI establishments.In those MTI establishments, FSIS had accumulated vast inspection experienceand has been able to sustain a uniform approach to inspection. SIS includes an inspection procedure that involves whole bird dispositionin which each inspector examines the viscera, the inside, and outside surfacesof the carcass. The innovation represented by SIS, besides enhancing inspectionproductivity in old MTI establishments, also provides some incentive toestablishments now operating under traditional inspection to convert toa system that can permit them to increase their output. After post-mortem inspection under SIS has been completed at the inspectionstation(s), establishment employees perform any necessary outside trimon all passed carcasses after all the giblets are harvested. The inspector'shelper may perform some trim if time permits. SIS was implemented in official establishments once processing broilersand cornish game hens under the MTI procedure. While SIS is an alternateinspection method, its use is not voluntary in those establishments; thenew system was implemented in existing MTI establishments on the basisof the Administrator's determination that SIS increases inspector efficiency.Establishments not operating under MTI may request the implementation ofSIS; the request is approved if the Administrator determines that the systemwill result in no loss of inspector efficiency. The chief difference between SIS and MTI is that under the new system thereis no mirror inspection system. Rather, there are one or two inspectionstations located on the processing line after the birds have been eviscerated.Each inspector examines the outside, inside, and viscera of the birds presentedfor inspection. The one-inspector form of SIS is known as SIS-1; the two-inspectorconfiguration is known as SIS-2. Inspection under both SIS-1 and SIS-2is conducted in two phases_a post-mortem inspection phase and a reinspectionphase. Under SIS-1, every bird on each production line is presented toa single inspector for examination. Under SIS-2, there are two inspectionstations at which each inspector examines the outside, inside, and viscera.Every other bird on the moving production line is presented to each inspectorwith the back side of the carcass toward the inspector and the viscerauniformly trailing or leading. In both SIS-1 and SIS-2, an establishmentemployee (termed a helper) is positioned next to each inspector. The maximuminspection rate for SIS-1 is 35 birds per minute; the maximum inspectionrate for SIS-2 is 70 birds per minute per inspector team_the same maximumrate as that once permitted under MTI.The inspection rates, or line speeds, are determined by the inspector-in-chargeof an official establishment on the basis of his or her professional judgment.Line speeds are dependent on the appropriate presentation of carcassesfor inspection. The adequacy of carcass presentation, in turn, dependson such factors as disease conditions in poultry flocks, plant operatingconditions, lighting, and facilities. FSIS has developed guidelines forthe presentation of carcasses in official poultry slaughter establishments.\1\<NOTE/> These guidelines provide objective criteria for determiningacceptance presentation and for reducing the line speeds when presentationis less than acceptable for inspecting birds at 70 birds per minute. Theseguidelines are applied by FSIS as a part of SIS.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ These guidelines are available for public inspection inthe office of the FSIS Hearing Clerk. Copies may be obtained free uponrequest from the Slaughter Inspection Standards and Procedures Division,Technical Services, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Departmentof Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250.In the inspection phase of SIS, inspectors determine which birds must besalvaged, reprocessed, condemned, retained for disposition by the veterinarian,or allowed to be moved down the line as a passed bird subject to reinspection.If an inspector finds that some poultry carcasses have certain defectsnot requiring condemnation of the whole carcass, the inspector may passthe carcass, which is then subject to reinspection to assure that the defectsare physically removed. The helper, at the inspector's direction, marksthese carcasses for trim unless the defects are obvious. Trimming of birdspassed subject to reinspection is performed by establishment employeesafter all giblets have been harvested. The inspector's helper may performsome trim if time permits.The reinspection station or stations are located at the end of the processinglines and after each chiller. At the prechill station, inspectors examinecarcasses that have been passed subject to reinspection by visually monitoring,checking data, and/or gathering samples at the station. SIS incorporatesa Finished Product Standards (FPS) program which is analogous to the AcceptableQuality Limits (AQL) program in the traditional and modified traditionalsystems and to the FPS in the NELS system. The FPS for SIS is applied intwo phases_before and after the carcass chilling process. In the prechillphase, the carcasses are checked for processing and trimming defects; inthe postchill phase, the birds are checked for defects caused by the chillingoperation.The AQL program used in the traditional inspection system was designedto be applied either before or after the chilling process. In practice,the AQL has been applied almost exclusively after the chill. (Some turkeyprocessing establishments conduct prechill AQL checks.) The poultry industryhas chosen to have AQL checks made after chilling because of productionline configurations and space availability. Under the traditional systems,the trimming of carcasses was not the responsibility of the establishment,and the performance of AQL checks after the chilling process was thereforeacceptable to FSIS. Under this arrangement, however, problems that necessitateda large amount of reworking of product occasionally developed because thefinished products were found not to be in compliance with AQL standards.With the advent of NELS and NTI, the responsibility for trimming carcasseswas shifted from FSIS inspectors to the establishment. FSIS's experiencein developing the FPS for NELS and NTI and in applying the PCOLQC programfor those systems led to the conclusion that a more responsive system isnow available. Data collected during the development of the FPS showedthat the poultry chilling system itself contributes to carcass defects.The postchill AQL program applied under the traditional systems checksfor defects that occur during processing and chilling. It was found thatapplying the PCOLQC and the FPS for NELS and NTI involved the use of twoproduct-checking systems_a prechill system and a postchill system. Theprechill system measures the degree of product nonconformance with processingand trimming standards, while the postchill system measures product nonconformancein terms of extraneous material present on birds exiting the chiller. Theprechill and postchill testing systems developed for NELS and NTI weredesigned to allow the industry to enhance its responsiveness to processchanges to minimize the amount of rework. As in NELS and NTI, the FPS programfor SIS includes a prechill test that measures the effectiveness of processingcontrols and postchill test that reflects changes taking place during thechilling process.Products not complying with the FPS are determined by FSIS to be adulterated.FSIS has determined that defects on carcasses or parts of carcasses belowthe action levels specified in the regulations do not render the carcassesor parts adulterated.The standards for nonconformance used in the FPS program for SIS are adaptedfrom those applied in the NELS system. These standards were based on datacollected on passed birds in a group of 15 randomly selected broiler establishments.In developing the standards, all defects and trimming errors found on thepassed birds were recorded. These same birds were then passed through thechilling process, recovered, and reexamined for all defects and trimmingerrors. Data from observations of the processed birds were compared withdata used to set the AQL standards for the traditional inspection systems.The FPS under NELS were then provisionally established, after consultationwith industry, using criteria similar to those used for the existing AQL.The standards were compared under plant operating conditions with the existingAQL standards and found to be valid. Product evaulated under the new FPSwas equivalent in quality to product evaluated according to the old AQLstandards. Thus, the specific values in the FPS and the list of nonconformancesfor SIS are the same as those already in use in the NELS system, and arebased on studies and experience with that system over the last 2 years.When SIS was implemented, certain establishments in the Southwest UnitedStates, principally in Arkansas and East Texas, experienced an unexpectedproblem with meeting the postchill FPS. These establishments advised theAgency that they were unique and either used water containing high levelsof minerals and/or killed birds fed milo instead of corn.The milo, like any feed, occasionally contaminated some carcasses. Theproblem was that the specks of milo contamination were small, numerous,and seemed to adhere to the carcass, making washing or reprocessing ofthe carcass difficult, if not impossible. Considerable time and Agencyresources were spent attempting to solve this problem. Working with severalleading industry representatives, the Agency concluded that establishmentscontrolling their manufacturing processes has little or no problems meetingthe postchill FPS.The operation of the FPS program is the responsibility of the officialestablishment. Under SIS, data on the finished product standard evaluationsare recorded using the cumulative sum (CUSUM) concept. In the CUSUM statisticalmethod, the data collected on a given day are compared with previouslycollected data to determine the establishment's ability to control itsprocessing operation and conform with product standards. Guidelines onthe FPS program are available upon request from the Slaughter InspectionStandards and Procedures Division at the address given in footnote 1. Theseguidelines include information on form preparation and CUSUM calculations,and provide examples to clarify the application of the FPS program. SIS-1 requires that the establishment provide one inspection station foreach line and reinspection facilities adequate for the removal and examinationof carcasses from each line for evaluation. SIS-2 requires the establishmentto provide two inspection stations for each line and similarly adequatereinspection facilities. The implementation of SIS thus entails certainfacility changes in the affected establishments. The SIS requirements forfacilities at the inspection and reinspection stations were published asa final rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 21, 1987 (52 FR 39207).Comments and FSIS's responses on the proposed rule for Facility and EquipmentRequirements for the Streamlined Inspection System for Broilers and CornishGame Hens were published with the final rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 21, 1987 (52 FR 39207).<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments </ITAG>Comments on the interim rule were solicited from interested parties inthe January 29, 1986, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 3569). FSIS received 28 comments_20 frompoultry processors, 4 from meat and poultry industry associations, 2 fromFSIS poultry inspectors, and 2 from USDA employee associations. The followingare summaries of those comments and FSIS's responses to each issue. A. Poultry Processors Many of the comments from poultry processors regarding SIS were favorable.The processors pronounced themselves ready to accept responsibilities fortrimming of defects on the carcasses and for presentation of the birdsfor inspection. The processors expressed confidence in their ability tomeet the prechill FPS; however, the postchill FPS is troublesome in someestablishments. 1. <T3>Comment: </T3>The postchill FPS is unreasonably tight, of no benefitto the public, and is subject to wide application variations. <T3>Response: </T3>The postchill FPS focuses on extraneous material andis designed to control defects that might be placed on the carcass as itmoves through the chiller. These kinds of defects are essentially extraneousmaterial caused by minute pieces of debris redistributed by the chillerduring the course of the day or bits of mineral that might be a part ofthe entire potable water supplies. As discussed earlier, some establishments experienced unexpected problemsin meeting the postchill FPS. However, extensive research by the Agencyfound the postchill FPS to be reasonable and achievable if the establishmentscontrol their processing operation and react to the ongoing data collectedon the prechill FPS. The postchill FPS test is necessary for it is theonly check for nonconformances on the carcasses caused by the chillingprocess and the last official check on the carcasses before the productleaves the establishment. 2. <T3>Comment: </T3>A time limit should be imposed for conducting a postchillFPS test to reduce variation in the application of the standard. <T3>Response: </T3>FSIS agrees with this commenter and has distributedto all establishments performing FPS tests instructions establishing atime limit of 5 to 7 minutes for a postchill FPS test and 8 to 10 minutesfor a prechill FPS test. Monitoring personnel operating outside these timelimits are to be correlated to provide uniform administration of the FPSprogram. To further reduce the variation in the application of the standard,the Agency developed a procedure for observing the carcass while performingthe FPS tests. These timeframes and procedures were published in FSIS Directive6120.1 dated August 27, 1987.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Copies of this directive may be obtained free upon requestfrom the Slaughter Inspection Standards and Procedures Division, TechnicalServices, Food Safety and Inspection Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture,Washington, DC 20250. A copy is also available for public inspection inthe Office of the FSIS Hearing Clerk.3. <T3>Comment: </T3>Place a size limit on the extraneous material countedon the postchill FPS. <T3>Response: </T3>Since all extraneous material added to the carcass arefrom the production process, counting all of the extraneous material isa direct indication of the degree of process control in the establishment.Production managers not allowing extraneous material on the product, througha process control program or by reacting to the extraneous material dataobtained on the prechill FPS checks, should have little or no problem meetingthe postchill FPS regardless of the size of the extraneous material. TheAgency also realizes the differences that people have in seeing varioussizes of particles. Therefore, it is difficult to set a size limitationwhen agreement cannot be reached on a size which is visible to all people.4. <T3>Comment: </T3>The postchill FPS is not analogous to the AQL. <T3>Response: </T3>The FPS program consists of two testing systems_prechilland postchill. The prechill FPS program was designed to be analogous tothe AQL. FPS is applied at the prechill location so that any problems developingon the evisceration line can be detected early and corrected before productreaches the chiller. This makes the system more responsive than AQL. However,some defects can occur to product as it moves through the chiller, whichmakes the postchill FPS necessary. Establishments controlling their processingoperation and reacting to the ongoing data collected on the prechill FPSshould find the postchill FPS reasonable and achievable.  5. <T3>Comment: </T3>On MP-Form 231 (FSIS Form 6500-2), an establishment ispenalized five points under category 7 for not removing airsacculitis exudatefrom a bird that is not marked. An establishment should not be penalizedfor a USDA inspection error.   <T3>Response: </T3>FSIS agrees. During the development of the NELS FPSprogram, with an on-line control program, FSIS thought that categories7 and 8 on MP-Form 231 (FSIS Form 6500-2) would adequately control theremoval of lesions/conditions. Upon developing the SIS FPS program, thecontrol of removal of these lesions/conditions was designed identicallyto the NELS FPS. Since then, it has become evident that the lack of a QCprogram requires a permanent marking system for identifying lesions/conditionsand is necessary to adequately control trimming. Therefore, the rule hasbeen modified to reflect this change.  An establishment shall have a permanent marking system for birds identifiedby a USDA inspector as needing removal of airsacculitis exudate from theinside surfaces of the carcass. When removable lesions/conditions are identifiedinside the carcass by the USDA inspector, the helper will be directed bythe inspector to apply the permanent mark to the carcass. Subsequent tothat inspection, if establishment or inspection personnel find removableinside lesions/conditions in carcasses without the permanent mark, theestablishment continues to be responsible for the removal of the lesion/conditions,but the inspection error is not recorded and charged against the establishmentin the FPS test. The affected carcasses will be hungback for IIC dispositionand inspection correlation.B. USDA Employee Association  1. <T3>Comment: </T3>A poultry establishment cannot handle the responsibilityfor trimming designated defects on passed birds.   <T3>Response: </T3>This responsibility has already been accepted by establishmentsoperating under the NELS inspection system, and studies conducted by FSIScomparing NELS and MTI and traditional inspection have proven that establishmentsare capable of handling this responsibility. Preliminary studies of thetrim performed under SIS indicate that establishments are having no problemsin meeting the trim FPS.  2. <T3>Comment: </T3>Not enough FPS tests are performed under the SIS to detectunacceptable product.   <T3>Response: </T3>FPS tests are performed under the SIS as often as AQLtests were performed under MTI. The FPS tests conducted by FSIS personnelare the minimum number of tests required, and that number may be increasedat the discretion of the inspector-in-charge.  3. <T3>Comment: </T3>The postchill FPS is effective in the protection of thepublic's health. The postchill FPS should not be relaxed. Poultry processorsthat maintain programs of adequate feed withdrawal, properly maintain andoperate automatic equipment, wash carcasses properly, and filter chillwater can meet the present postchill FPS.   <T3>Response: </T3>FSIS agrees with this comment.C. FSIS Poultry Inspectors  1. <T3>Comment: </T3>SIS places a greater burden on the FSIS inspector, leadingto greater stress and fatigue.   <T3>Response: </T3>An easily and rapidly adjustable platform and improvedlighting are required under SIS to aid the inspector. SIS has removed theburden of identifying and verifying outside trim. Presentation guidelineshave also been issued to ensure uniformly good presentation so the inspectoris not overly burdened. Industrial engineers have measured the ergonomicsof the inspection tasks, and a maximum line speed has been establishedat which the inspector can perform effective inspection without greaterstress and/or fatigue.  2. <T3>Comment: </T3>In andSection;381.76(b)(3)(i)(<T3>d</T3>), the definition of ``start number'' is unclear.   <T3>Response: </T3>The definition for ``start number'' has been changedto read, ``A value halfway between zero and the action number. The startnumber is used to determine the starting CUSUM for the first subgroup ofa shift and to reset the CUSUM value if the CUSUM is equal to or greaterthan the action number.''  3. <T3>Comment: </T3>In andSection;381.76 (b)(3)(iv)     (<T3>d</T3>)<T3/>(<T3>4</T3>)<T3/>(<T3>i</T3>)<T3/>(<T3>E</T3>)<T3> </T3>there is no mention of the resumption of random time postchillFPS testing after it has been suspended due to retesting of carcasses thatwere produced by a process that was not in control as determined by processinga prechill FPS testing.   <T3>Response: </T3>The following sentence has been added to that provision:``Once all product identified as needing retesting has arrived at the postchillsampling location, random time postchill FPS testing resumes.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous Amendments  </ITAG>Paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(5) of andSection;381.76 were inadvertently omittedfrom the Code of Federal Regulations in the publication of the January29, 1986, interim rule (51 FR 3569). These provisions provide requirementsapplicable to the NTI and NELS inspection systems that were not affectedby the interim rule. Therefore, this final rule corrects that error byreissuing those provisions.  In addition, FSIS overlooked two references to ``Modified Traditional Inspection''(MTI) contained in andSection;381.76 (c)(3) and (c)(6). Since SIS replacedMTI, those references to MTI are deleted, and ``SIS'' is added insteadin this final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 381  </ITAG>Poultry products inspection, Post-mortem.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Rule </ITAG>The interim rule amending 9 CFR Part 381 was published at 51 FR 3569, onJanuary 29, 1986, is adopted as a final rule with the following changes:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 381_POULTRY PRODUCTS INSPECTION REGULATIONS  </ITAG>1.

The establishment shall provide threeinspection stations on each eviscerating line in compliance with the facilityrequirements andSection; 381.36(d)(1). The three inspectors shall inspectthe inside, viscera, and outside of all birds presented. Each inspectorshall be flanked by two establishment employees_the presenter and the helper.The presenter shall ensure that the bird is properly eviscerated and presentedfor inspection and the viscera uniformly trailing or leading. The inspectorshall determine which birds shall be salvaged, reprocessed, condemned,retained for disposition by the veterinarian, or allowed to proceed downthe line as a passed bird subject to reinspection. Poultry carcasses withcertain defects not requiring condemnation of the entire carcass and specifiedin the partial quality control agreement as defects the establishment shallremove, shall be passed by the inspector, but shall be subject to reinspectionto ensure the physical removal of the specified defects. The helper, underthe supervision of the inspector, shall mark such carcasses for trim whenthe defects are not readily observable. Trimming of birds passed subjectto reinspection shall be performed by:(<T3>1</T3>) The helper, time permitting, and(<T3>2</T3>) One or more plant trimmers positioned after giblet harvestand prior to reinspection.(<T3>b</T3>) A reinspection station shall be located at the end of eachline. This station shall comply with the facility requirements in andSection;381.36(d)(2). The inspector shall ensure that the establishment has performedthe indicated trimming of carcasses passed subject to reinspection by visuallymonitoring, checking data, and/or gather samples at the station and atother critical points on the line. Specific reinspection activities shallbe based on the establishment's partial quality control system and itsperformance under that system as determined by the inspector.(ii) The approved quality control program for the establishment shall includecritical control points on the line, which shall be monitored by the inspector.Establishment quality control employees shall operate the poultry carcasson-line quality control program and shall make immediately available toinspection personnel any and all data collected and maintained under theapproved partial quality control program.(iii) An inspector shall monitor the establishment's application of thepoultry carcass on-line quality control program and shall take correctiveaction when he/she determines that the establishment has failed to maintainor correct its process as described in the approved quality control program.(iv) The maximum inspection rate for NELS shall be 91 birds per minuteper eviscerating line.(5) The following requirements are also applicable to the NTI System:(i) Inspection under the NTI System is conducted in two phases, a post-morteminspection phase and a reinspection phase. The NTI-1 Inspection Systemrequires that the establishment provide one inspection station for eachline and adequate reinspection facilitiates so carcasses can be removedfrom each line for evaluation. The NTI-2 Inspection System requires thatthe establishment provide two inspection stations for each line and adequatereinspection facilities so carcasses can be removed from each line forevaluation.(<T3>a</T3>) <T3>Post-mortem inspection.</T3> Each inspection station must comply withthe facility requirements in andSection;381.36(e)(1). Each inspector shallbe flanked by an establishment employee assigned to be the inspector'shelper. The one inspector on an NTI-1 Inspection System shall be presentedevery bird. Each inspector on an NTI-2 Inspection System line shall bepresented every other bird on the line. An establishment employee shallpresent each bird to the inspector properly eviscerated with the back sidetoward the inspector and the viscera uniformly trailing or leading. Eachinspector shall inspect the inside, viscera, and outside of all birds presented.The inspector shall determine which bird shall be salvaged, reprocessed,condemned, retained for disposition by a veterinarian, or allowed to proceeddown the line as a passed bird subject to trim and reinspection. Turkeycarcasses with certain defects not requiring condemnation of the entirecarcass and specified in the partial quality control program describedin paragraph (d) of this section as defects the establishment shall remove,shall be passed by the inspector, but shall be subject to reinspectionto ensure the physical removal of the specified defects.
