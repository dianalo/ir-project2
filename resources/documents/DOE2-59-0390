The resultsof this study are briefly described. The study concluded that the projectedproduction and associated demand for steam-raising fuel in each of themajor oil sand/heavy oil areas was more than adequate to allow coal orcoke to be economically competitive with natural gas and that provenreserves of both coal and natural gas are more than adequate to satisfydemands for fuel for 25 years. Coal in particular, is an underutilizedresource, while supplies of coke are limited. This fuel can be supplementedby coal. A research program to develop combustion technology for coaluse in enhanced oil recovery was initiated in April 1987. Boiler manufacturerswere asked to propose designs for an innovative coal-fired steam generatorand two designs were chosen. A two track development program has beenadopted.</TEXT></DOC>
