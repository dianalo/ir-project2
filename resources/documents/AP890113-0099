Israelis sat in one row. Palestinians sat in another. Israelistalked. Palestinians talked. But they didn't talk to each other.   With television cameras filming their every move, the delegateslistened politely to a string of speeches on Europe's role in makingpeace in the Middle East.   The two-day conference, which opened Thursday, was the idea ofseveral members of the European Parliament and was organized by fourFrench intellectuals. It brought together leftist members of theIsraeli Parliament, representatives of the Palestine LiberationOrganization and other Palestinians.   The Palestinian delegation was led by Ibrahim Souss, head of thePLO general delegation in France, and Nabir Sha'ath, longtimeadvisor to PLO chief Yasser Arafat.   Israeli delegates were Yair Tsaban, head of the socialist MapamParty, Lova Eliav and Ora Namir of the center-left Labor Party andShulamit Aloni, head of the leftist Citizens Rights Movement.   In a speech, Eliav called compromise ``the essence of peace,''and he urged direct dialogue with ``the opposite party'' _ the PLO.   Fayez Abu Rahme, a prominent Palestinian lawyer in theIsraeli-occupied Gaza Strip, said the 13-month-old Palestinianuprising would ``stop tomorrow if Israel agreed to an internationalconference to formulate a peace treaty based on mutual recognitionand self-determination.''   ``After 40 years of saying no to Israel, we finally said yes toco-existence with Israel,'' he said. ``We are for a state thatrecognizes and cooperates with Israel. Now, it's up to Israel to sayyes.''   The Israeli government, now led by right-wing Prime MinisterYitzhak Shamir of the Likud bloc, has rejected the idea of aconference.   Yael Tamir, representing the leftist Peace Now Movement inIsrael, called for one day of non-violence in Gaza and the West Bankto promote peace.   She also urged Palestinian delegates to clarify the PLO'spositions, including Arafat's renunciation of terror last month.``You must say these things again and again, and the Israelis willfinally hear,'' she said.   Arafat renounced terrorism and recognized Israel last month whichled the United States to reverse a 13-year ban on talks with the PLO.   David Susskind, president of the Belgian Jewish Community Centerand moderator of the debate, called for the two peoples to work inharmony.   ``The idea of being pro-Palestinian or pro-Israeli has become athing of the past,'' he said. ``Being for peace means being for bothpeoples.''</TEXT></DOC>
