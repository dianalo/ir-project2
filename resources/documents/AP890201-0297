The nine-member committee appointed Robert Wilmouth, president ofthe Chicago-based National Futures Association, to assist in thereview of trading procedure and policy, said Merc spokesman AndrewYemma.   The committee held its first meeting Wednesday, a closed sessionexpected to be the first in a series to discuss trading rules andprocedures.   Separately, in Washington the staff of the Commodity FuturesTrading Commission recommended approval of the Merc's proposedGlobex electronic trading system, a key element in the exchange'smove to set up after-hours global futures trading. Electronictrading also is seen by some as helping police improper activity bymore closely monitoring deals.   The commission, the federal agency that regulates the futuresindustry, was expected to vote on the proposal Thursday.   Also, the House Agriculture Committee designated Rep. GlennEnglish, D-Okla., to direct a congressional investigation intotrading practices in the futures and options markets.   English, chairman of the panel's subcommittee on conservation,credit and rural development, said the probe would focus on theCFTC's regulation of the markets and on the self-regulating abilityof the markets themselves.   The Merc established its review panel following disclosure of atwo-year undercover federal probe of alleged widespread fraud andillegal trading practices in the Chicago futures markets.   One practice under increasing scrutiny has been dual trading, inwhich traders can buy and sell for themselves and their customerssimultaneously.   The longtime practice is legal but critics say it invites abuseof the traditional open-outcry style of commodities trading, inwhich traders use shouts and hand signals to buy and sell futurescontracts in exchange trading pits.   Karsten Mahlmann, chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade,indicated at a closed traders meeting Tuesday that the exchange mayreassess dual trading in light of the burgeoning scandal.   And in Wednesday's editions, the Wall Street Journal reportedthat ABS Partners, widely regarded as the most powerful group ofbrokers at the Merc, has banned dual trading by its members to avoid``an appearance of conflict of interest.''   None of the ABS traders returned telephone requests Wednesdayafternoon for comment on the report.   Such a move would be a further indication of how key futuresmarket players may be trying to forestall possibly strongergovernment restrictions of their business in the wake of the fraudprobe.   It also may indicate how dual trading could end up as thescapegoat of any attempted in-house damage control, much ascomputerized program trading became the target of voluntaryrestrictions among a number of major Wall Street firms following theOctober 1987 stock market crash.   Broker groups such as ABS employ brokers in different exchangetrading pits _ where commodities futures contracts are actuallybought and sold _ and split losses and profits with their members.   ABS Partners includes 24 brokers and other members and iscontrolled by Maury A. Kravitz and James J. Kaulentis, two of theMerc's wealthiest and most powerful brokers, the Journal reported.   Kravitz is a longtime friend and former law partner of LeoMelamed, the powerful chairman of the Merc's executive committee anda key figure in the exchange's growth in financial futures trading,the newspaper stated.   In endorsing approval of the Mercantile Exchange's Globex system,the CFTC staff recommended that Globex trading initialy be limitedto futures contracts on the Australian dollar, British pound,Canadian dollar, West German mark, Swiss franc, Japanese yen,Eurodollar, U.S. Treasury bills and gold.   Globex, developed by Reuters Holding PLC, is an electronic systemwhich beginning this fall would be used before and after regularexchange hours.   Eventually, all of the exchange's contracts would be eligible forGlobex trading.</TEXT></DOC>
