Molecularweight measurements and gel permeation chromatography were used to monitorthe kinetics as well as the yields of the reactions. Two variants ofthe experiments were conducted. Either butadiene was added to the systemafter termination of isoprene polymerization or vice versa. The firstvariant was found to be more conducive to a quantitative estimation ofthe catalyst efficiency and is therefore used in the mathematical formulationof the process.</TEXT></DOC>
