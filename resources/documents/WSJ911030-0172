The sleuthing technology, known as the polymerase chainreaction, or PCR, was invented in 1983 by scientists at CetusCorp. and sold to Hoffmann-La Roche, a unit of Roche HoldingLtd. of Switzerland, this summer. Popularized outsidemedicine, PCR has yielded genetic &quot;fingerprints&quot; that havehelped to identify criminal suspects, prehistoric animals andcasualties of the Gulf War.</LP><TEXT>   But PCR is opening even more windows in diagnosticmedicine, where its ability to pinpoint genes much moreadeptly and quickly than other methods has aided researchersin identifying the bacteria, viruses and mutant genes thatcause disease. Starting as early as next year, PCR test kitsmay become commercially available to clinical labs, movingthe technology further into the medical mainstream.   &quot;It's changed the way we think about diagnostic medicine,&quot;says Jeffrey Cossman of Georgetown University School ofMedicine, which this month co-sponsored a conference on theexplosion in uses for PCR and some of the difficulties inharnessing the technology.   PCR involves plucking a gene from a sample of blood ortissue through the use of DNA probes, which bracket thetarget much like bookends, and then replicating it as many asa trillion times. This bit of medical alchemy permitsdetection of one cancer cell in a million, making it 1,000 to10,000 times more sensitive than earlier techniques. Thathelps to alert doctors faster to relapses after treatment andserves as an early warning system for new viral infectionstoo recent to have sparked symptoms.   The speed of the technology tantalizes doctors who trackcontagious illness. In the case of tuberculosis, says JackCrawford of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta,&quot;rapid detection using PCR offers the possibility of earlyintervention.&quot;   Certainly, the tool isn't fail-safe. PCR produces swarmsof DNA copies that can overrun lab equipment and taintresults of subsequent experiments, leading to as much as a30% rate of false-positive readings, warns Arthur Hoobermanof the University of Chicago. Cetus scientist John Sninskyunveiled a new sterilization technique that can prevent suchcontamination. But the opposite problem -- that of falsenegative results -- occasionally troubles researchers, too.   Some researchers also worry about some of the practicalimplications of PCR's ability to detect the presence ofdisease-bearing genes long before symptoms appear. &quot;The keyquestion is what are we going to do with all this increasedsensitivity,&quot; says Dr. Robert Yolken of the Johns Hopkinspediatrics department. &quot;Will we diagnose more people who aresick, or will we find out that everyone is carrying smallamounts of virus and do more harm than good?&quot;   For several years, PCR has been used to detect genesresponsible for such diseases as sickle-cell anemia. Now,cystic fibrosis, which damages the lungs, and Fragile-Xsyndrome, a type of retardation, have joined the list ofgenetic defects that PCR targets. The National Institutes ofHealth recently funded a network of cystic fibrosis screeningprojects. Johns Hopkins University geneticist Haig H.Kazazian says he supports similar screening programs for suchblood disorders as sickle-cell anemia and thalassemia, aswell as for Tay-Sachs disease, a fatal enzyme deficiency.   Oncologists are using PCR to detect cancer-causing genesas well as microscopic traces of disease that can leadmalignancies to recur after treatment. They can diagnosecertain lymphomas and leukemias based on a telltale switch inthe location of certain chromosomes.   In the AIDS epidemic, PCR has a half dozen distinct uses,according to Gerald Schochetman of the CDC. It solved theproblem of diagnosing newborns, who carry maternal antibodiesthat mask their condition in conventional tests. PCR can alsodetect HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, in newly infectedadults before they make antibodies. Further, PCR can helptrack disease progression by measuring how much virus apatient is carrying.   PCR is also emerging as a tool for screening donated bloodfor HIV. The American Red Cross is planning to use thetechnology in its central laboratory in Washington. SaysGerald Sandler of the Red Cross: &quot;There are 50,000 people towhom we've said: `You test false-positive so you can't donateblood.' We'll put in PCR not to detect more {HIV} but to worktoward reinstating those people as blood donors.&quot;   PCR is having a major impact on more common infectiousdiseases, too. For herpes virus infections, Thomas Smith ofthe Mayo Clinic says, &quot;PCR gives us more diagnostic options&quot;because it can pick up such hard-to-detect herpes familymembers as the Epstein-Barr virus, linked with mononucleosisand lymphoma, and the papilloma viruses, linked with genitalwarts and tumors. Dr. Yolken of Johns Hopkins says PCR canalso detect cases of virusborne diarrhea before antibodiesare produced, making it potentially easier to curb outbreaksin hospitals and day-care centers.   For David Persing of the Mayo Clinic, PCR has shedunexpected historical light on Lyme disease. After combingthrough insect museums, he performed PCR on tick specimensdating from the 1940s, and concluded that the ailment wasaround decades earlier than doctors had thought.   Next month, Roche is launching clinical trials of itsfirst commercial PCR candidate, a test for chlamydia, acommon sexually transmitted infection, and the company hopesto file for market approval in the first quarter of 1992.According to Dr. Yolken, people with infectious chlamydia cantest negative in conventional tests. What's more, the companysays, its test takes only four hours, compared with two daysfor other tests.   Roche has also slated clinical trials for a secondcommercial PCR venture, a confirmatory test for HIV, in thefirst half of 1992. Further into the future, Roche scientistsare developing a test that can distinguish between the benignand cancerous types of the papilloma virus.   Roche says it owns the rights to all present and futureuses of PCR by virtue of a $300 million deal with Cetus inJuly.   Eastman Kodak Co. has asked for a preliminary injunctionto block Cetus's sale of the technology, and a hearing hasbeen set for Nov. 19 in Delaware. Kodak claims it retainedbroad rights to PCR technology from a 1986 contract withCetus. Cetus terminated that contract in 1989, when itlicensed diagnostic rights to Roche.   Would-be competitors are now developing potentialsecond-generation diagnostic tests similar to PCR. Theyinclude Abbott Laboratories of Abbott Park, Ill., which callsits technology the ligase chain reaction. Amoco Corp. isworking on another potential contender calledQ-beta-replicase. So promising is the market for suchgene-based tests that Thomas MacMahon, president of the RocheDiagnostics Group, predicts, &quot;Any major company in thediagnostics field will want to compete.&quot;   Roche, meanwhile, expects a bonanza from PCR. Mr. MacMahonpredicts that the world-wide market for gene-based diagnostictests will reach $500 million by 1995 or 1996 and double to$1 billion by the year 2000.   Along with opening up new treatment options for patients,PCR may also open up business opportunities for drugcompanies. Harley Rotbart of the University of Colorado,Denver, notes that there are 75,000 cases of viral meningitisand encephalitis annually that can leave their victims --especially children -- brain-damaged or dead. Because therewas no practical way to test for the enteroviruses at faultin such cases, a number of companies shelved potentiallyhelpful drugs.   With PCR, &quot;now there is a way to test,&quot; says Dr. Rotbart.He hopes to launch clinical trials of antiviral drugs bySchering Plough Corp., the G.D. Searle unit of Monsanto Co.and the Sterling Winthrop unit of Kodak.</TEXT></DOC>
