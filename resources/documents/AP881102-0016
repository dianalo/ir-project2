MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis andamp; Co. should have seen itcoming.   A campaign with a clear game plan could have dealt in advancewith the troublesome liberal label it first shunned and now hasclaimed as its own. It might have defined the label in its own wayinstead of leaving the Republicans leeway to write the campaigndefinition.   Political labeling often has become a problem for presidentialcandidates in both parties. The tag that has hurt most reads``liberal.'' Those who could fought back by enforcing the right totell voters what the term meant.   And if that bit of history weren't warning enough, George Bushhad told the Democrats he was coming at them on ideology.   Dukakis' late conversion is risky. The safer time to define acandidate and his philosophy is by midsummer, not midautumn, ninedays before the voters choose a president.   The Massachusetts governor had tried to position himself as acandidate for whom ideology wouldn't count. His organization saw toit that the Democrats adopted a brief, vague party platform, inmarked contrast to the book-length catalogue of promises the partyhad issued four years earlier.   Bush insisted that ideology was an issue, and when the Democratsleft him the opening, he proceeded to define the word ``liberal'' tomean someone who is soft on crime, soft on national defense, likelyto spend too much money and therefore force higher taxes. He thenproceeded to attach the word to Dukakis.   An NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll reflects the impact. Foursurveys, the latest in mid-October, show a steady progression in thenumber of likely voters who consider Dukakis too liberal to be agood president, to 37 percent, up 11 points from midsummer.   After weeks of resisting the liberal description, and aftercomplaining about Bush's use of the tab in nationally televiseddebate, Dukakis shifted on Sunday and proclaimed that he is indeed aliberal, ``in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Trumanand John Kennedy.''   He said that means working for the average American, helpingthose who need help, and at the same time, paying the government'sbills. His problem is that Bush has had most of the campaign tohammer at his definition of the term, insisting that it puts Dukakisout of the American mainstream.   ``This election isn't about ideology,'' Dukakis told theDemocratic National Convention in accepting his nomination on July21. ``It's about competence.''   That statement is more often quoted than the tellingcounterpointing Bush supplied in his own acceptance speech. ``...Competence is a narrow ideal,'' the vice president said.``Competence makes the trains run on time but doesn't know wherethey're going. Competence is the creed of the technocrat ....   ``The truth is, this election is about the beliefs we share, thevalues we honor, the principles we hold dear.''   Bush was trailing in the public opinion polls at that point, bymargins similar to those that now read in his favor.   The rhetoric of August foretold a big part of the campaignstrategy that has reversed the odds. Bush tells his campaign ralliesthat beliefs and values are behind his differences with Dukakis onsuch matters as prison furloughs and a requirement that teacherslead pupils in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.   ``The liberal governor of Massachusetts,'' Bush says over andover again, disagrees with him.   The fiercest battles over political labeling often have comeduring struggles for presidential nomination, not afterward.   Bush says Dukakis claimed liberal credentials when he needed themto win Democratic primaries, on his way to the nomination, and thentried to move to the middle. That kind of positioning isn't unusual;it is done in both political parties.   Indeed, over the course of his career, Bush has done some of ithimself. When he ran for the GOP nomination in 1980, he was cast asa moderate Republican against the conservative who won _ RonaldReagan. When he lost a Senate seat 10 years earlier in Texas, it wasas a relatively liberal Republican, beaten by a Democrat whooutflanked him on the right on some issues. The Democrat was LloydBentsen.   And when Reagan turned to Bush for the vice presidentialnomination in 1980, a good many GOP conservatives were outraged.They knew Bush by his resume and by his reputation; if he'd runagainst Reagan he must be out of the party's liberal wing.   He wasn't. But to victorious conservatives _ the ones who latercomplained that Reagan was acting pragmatically _ any moderate wassuspect.   The Republican labeling war was fiercest in 1964, with formerSen. Barry Goldwater, conservative, in one corner and the lateNelson A. Rockefeller, liberal, in the other. ``Liberal'' wasn't apopular word in GOP circles then or now, so Rockefeller definedhimself as a mainstream Republican.   Goldwater's conservatives won the battle and lost the war toLyndon B. Johnson's Democratic landslide. From that day, liberalRepublicans chose to designate themselves as moderates.   While Dukakis likened his liberalism to men like Roosevelt,Truman and Kennedy, he sidestepped when asked if he also was in theliberal tradition of such Democrats as George McGovern and WalterMondale, both liberals, both big losers.   Maybe he should have tried the formula described by GeorgeRomney, an early loser in the contest for the 1968 GOP nomination:   ``I'm as conservative as the Constitution, as liberal as Lincolnand as progressive as Theodore Roosevelt,'' he said.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
