<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-28-0086 </DOCNO><TEXT>Development of techniques for uranium enrichment has been steadily carriedout in Japan leading to the full-scale operation of a pilot plant, startingin 1982- which uses a centrifugal method with a capacity of about 50ton USW-year. For the commercialization of uranium enrichment business,two private firms have been established and a commercial plant with atarget final capacity of 1,500 ton SWU-year is planned to be constructed.It is expected that the total uranium enrichment capacity of Japan willreach 3,000 ton SWU-year around 2000. The Power Reactor and Nuclear FuelDevelopment Corporation, which has been engaged in studies on the applicationof new materials to the development of high-performance centrifuges,has already achieved a target performance at the individual centrifugelevel and is making efforts toward block-level testing and pilot plantconstruction. Establishment of mass-production techniques for such high-performancecentrifuges made of new materials is expected to result in a great reductionin costs for enrichment services by commercial plants. On the other hand,further research and development efforts in various areas are necessaryfor establishing laser uranium enrichment techniques. (Nogami, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
