The Purchase, N.Y.-based company said earnings rose to a recordfor any quarter of $269.3 million, or $1.02 per share, in the threemonths ended Sept. 9 compared with $241.6 million, or 91 cents ashare, a year earlier.   Third-quarter revenue rose to $3.90 billion from $3.13 billion ayear earlier.   The 1988 figures included an after-tax loss of $5.9 million onthe sale of a winery in Spain.   In the latest quarter, operating profit in the soft drinkbusiness rose 36 percent to $205.7 million on a 26 percent salesincrease to $1.55 billion.   Excluding the loss on the winery sales and the impact of recentacquisitions and sales in the domestic soft drink business,operating profits were up 12 percent, PepsiCo said.   Improvement in domestic operating margins and higher pricesoffset a decline in international results that reflectedacceleration of concentrate shipments and higher marketing spending.   Operating profit from snack foods including Frito-Lay productsrose 30 percent to $211 million while sales rose 27 percent to$1.06 billion in the quarter.   The results included strong worldwide volume gains andcontinuing margin improvements as well as the acquisition in Julyof Smiths and Walkers, two leading snack chip companies in theUnited Kingdom.   Worldwide earnings from restaurant operations rose 25 percent to$139.1 million while sales rose 22 percent to almost $1.3 billionin the quarter.   Operating earnings jumped 33 percent to $62.2 million at PizzaHut and 50 percent to $40.5 million at Taco Bell, but fell 4percent to $36.4 million at Kentucky Fried Chicken, where a stronginternational performance was offset by a decline in domesticoperations due to lower customer counts, higher labor costs andhigher chicken prices.   For the first nine months of the fiscal year, PepsiCo said itearned $699.3 million, or $2.64 a share, up 21.7 percent from$574.5 million, or $2.18 a share, a year ago.   Nine-month revenue rose 22.8 percent to $10.45 billion from$8.51 billion a year earlier.   The 1989 results included an after-tax net credit of $15.0million stemming mainly from a decision to retain a foreignbottling operation once held for sale, while the 1988 resultsreflected an after-tax charge of $16.3 million for reorganizingdomestic soft drink operations and the winery loss.</TEXT></DOC>
