Hazlett </HL><DD> 09/14/89 </DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO><TEXT>   The NFL's Raiders occasionally make money playing football. But mostly they make a fortune just playing the system. In 1983, a federal court awarded the team $33 million in antitrust damages because the National Football League had &quot;conspired&quot; to keep the Raiders from moving to Los Angeles, after the judge instructed the jury to consider the NFL as 28 competing firms. Sure enough, the jury quickly decided that the League was indeed in league.    There is, though, a real monopoly problem involving NFL franchises: Because there are many more municipal stadiums than football (or baseball or basketball) clubs, cities desiring Major League Status must sell the taxpayer's barn for a shot at stardom. No one has exploited this monopsonistic situation better than the Raiders.    In the early '80s, the L.A. Coliseum Commission snatched the Raiders from Oakland for more than $10 million. That's not the price of the team, but a bribe to move -- a cash-basis Welcome Wagon.    In response, the city of Oakland tried to seize the team in an imaginative eminent domain suit that not even the California courts could quite take seriously -- meaning that it only took five years of litigation for them to dismiss the suit. The loss jolted Oakland, whose fans supported the Raiders in roughly the manner the Iranian fundamentalists supported the Ayatollah.    Since the Raiders actually get paid to shop, they are again looking for a new home. First stop was tiny Irwindale, Calif., a mining town 40 miles due east of Los Angeles with a population of about 1,000, which offered the Raiders a nonrefundable $10 million in earnest money to consider locating there. Alas, Irwindale's financing fell apart.    Now the Raiders have their sights set on Sacramento, the seat of California's government. The local boosters want to build a $100 million private stadium, at no cost to the taxpayer -- except for a $50 million &quot;franchise fee&quot; from the city and county. Public interest arguments for this subsidy have been purchased at the going rate: A Chicago consulting firm has produced an estimate that the Raiders will infuse $1.4 billion into the local economy over the next 20 years. The study isn't worth the Raiders' deposit slip it's written on.    The assumptions employed were so optimistic as to make Rosy Scenario blush -- for instance, that the Sacramento Raiders will sell more tickets at 30% higher prices than the San Francisco 49ers. Naturally, the usual magic is performed with multiplier effects. Most important, it is simply posited that no dollar spent on Raiders football would ever otherwise be spent in Sacramento -- that sports money has no opportunity costs. If this were true, the way to prosperity would seem to be to build an infinite number of sports stadiums.    Unhappily, even these fluffy assumptions could not generate a break-even for the public till, so local politicians are busily devising schemes to raise taxes on local sporting events and hotel rooms -- a tricky business because subterfuges must be employed to avoid the two-thirds vote of the people required by law for all &quot;special assessments.&quot; The present value of these taxes will amount to about $150 per Sacramento household.    Whatever the studies are made to say, football bidding wars are a zero sum game: L.A. will lose whatever Oakland/Irwindale/Sacramento/ (Fill in your city here) gains. It doesn't seem to matter to local governments. Pepperdine economist Dean Baim's recent study of 14 baseball and football stadiums estimated that only one -- private (except for the land) Dodger Stadium -- was producing a positive flow into city coffers. The total net present value of the burden on local taxpayers for all 14 came to $136 million.    That the Raiders were rewarded by a jury for playing this game of Sack the Municipal Taxpayer is symptomatic of the crap-shoot condition of antitrust law. The NFL may be guilty of providing the world with too few teams, but the remedy chosen by the courts adds not a tight end to the roster. Indeed, NFL Rule 4.3, condemned in the Raiders' case as a restraint of trade, actually counteracted the effects of monopsony. By requiring three-quarters of all franchise owners to agree to any move, the rule mitigated &quot;the evident problems of opportunistic bargaining by `free-agent' franchises&quot; taking advantage of municipalities that have undertaken long-term stadium investments, as shown in a recent study by Loyola College (Baltimore) economist Stephen J.K. Walters.    Competition between localities to attract industry can be an effective constraint on foolishly inefficient taxes. The $60 million Sears just pocketed from the State of Illinois in exchange for retaining its headquarters in the state may well represent a competitive brake on the avarice of the state government. But there is a fine line separating tax rate reductions from the public dole. The frenzied bidding for the Raiders -- Oakland has a $54 million deal to lure them back -- has so accelerated the momentum for a special tax increase that the liberal mayor of Sacramento, Ann Rudin, has piled on with an extra arts subsidy increment.    The Raiders have collected $20 million from two California cities, may be about to pick up $50 million more, and even knocked off an additional $33 million in the Antitrust Litigation Bowl. In a free country, big spending football maniacs should be able to view nickel defenses from on high in Malcolm Forbesian luxury boxes, but in a just country, Joe Taxpayer should not have to serve as their water boy. ---    Mr. Hazlett teaches economics and public policy at the University of California, Davis. </TEXT></DOC>
