Other federal appeals courts have ruled both ways on theissue. But because the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appealsin New York is considered more influential on labor issues,its decision is likely to guide judges in similar casesaround the country unless the decision is appealed further,attorneys said.</LP><TEXT>   The appeals court reversed a lower-court ruling that hadbarred a former vice president at Astoria Federal Savings andamp;Loan from suing. The district judge had ruled that becausethe New York State Division of Human Rights had rejected thediscrimination claim, the matter couldn't be brought tofederal court.   Age-discrimination attorneys said that if the lower-courtdecision had been allowed to stand, workers would haveavoided decisions on their cases by the state agencies, wheremany age-discrimination cases currently are resolved.   Federal law requires that if a state has its ownage-discrimination law, a worker must at least begin thestate proceedings before suing in federal court; the federalsuit can't be filed until 60 days after the state proceedingsbegin, unless they are terminated earlier. Under thelower-court decision, anyone who let a state agency decide anage-discrimination case would be risking the right to pursuethe case later in federal court, said Lamont White, anattorney with the federal Equal Employment OpportunityCommission.   The EEOC and the American Association of Retired Personsfiled friend-of-the-court briefs in support of the formerAstoria Federal employee, Angelo Solimino.   In order to pursue a federal suit &quot;you'd have to get outof the state process as quickly as you could,&quot; said CathyVentrell-Monsees, an attorney with the AARP.   The appeals court agreed that it would be unfair to bar anemployee from suing in federal court just because a stateagency didn't find probable cause for a discrimination case.The court said the federal age-discrimination law wasn'tmeant to allow state agency's fact-finding decisions to standwithout judicial review.   Anthony Atlas, an attorney for Astoria Federal, said nodecision has been made on whether to appeal. Leonard Flamm,an attorney for Mr. Solimino, couldn't be reached forcomment.   ---   WOMEN LOSE BIG as a result of bias in the justice system,a new Florida study shows.   The extensive 2 1/2-year study ordered by the state'sSupreme Court showed that bias against women is &quot;pervasive&quot;in the state's legal system. &quot;People misunderstand genderbias as the `sweetie and honey syndrome' -- that it's judgescalling women these names in court,&quot; says Florida SupremeCourt Justice Gerald Kogan, chairman of the commission.&quot;That's only a minute part of the problem.&quot;   He said &quot;a great majority&quot; of the findings reflect anational problem. Florida is the ninth state to issue areport on the issue, and 21 other states are in the processof analyzing gender bias in the courts, according to LynnHecht Schafran, a New York attorney who was an adviser on theproject. &quot; The overall pattern of systemic bias is repeatedfrom state to state,&quot; she says.   The commission found, among other things, that:   -- In divorces, men typically keep more than half of themarital assets and walk away from a marriage with &quot;anenhanced earning capacity,&quot; but women and children areeconomically harmed.   -- Women serve more time in prison than men do for thesame crimes and have fewer innovative programs and facilitiesat their disposal.   -- Female lawyers are treated as inferiors by many lawyersand judges in the courtroom.   The commission is composed of lawyers, judges and atrustee. In its 239-page report, it suggests that femalelawyers in Florida have a lot to be unhappy about. They areshort-changed on judgeships. As prosecutors, they make lessmoney than male counterparts and they are often assigned toless important cases. Opposing male attorneys interrupt theircourt presentations more frequently than they do other maleattorneys. Judges as women to prove their credentials.   Many women can't afford adequate counsel in divorce cases,the study found, and judges tend to minimize homemakers'contributions. They also wrongly believe that middle-agewomen with little job experience will quickly enter the workforce and therefore need little alimony.   The commission found that longstanding beliefs persistamong many in the criminal justice system that domesticviolence against women is acceptable. Police are hesitant toarrest offenders and prosecutors are reluctant to presscharges. Often, the victim is blamed, the commission's reportsaid.   Male convicts are released from prison sooner than womenbecause of overcrowding. Women are prosecuted forprostitution, but seldom are the men who sell and buy theirservices, the report said.   The commission recommended legislation and remedies, suchas the re-education of judges and lawyers and more emphasisin law schools on studying such bias. It also calls for payequity in state court jobs.   Other proposals call for a community-property law for thestate and allowing credit-card payments of child support.   ---   RIGHTS GROUP SUES INS over privately operated detentioncenter.   The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights asked a federaljudge to force the Immigration and Naturalization Service toturn over documents about a facility operated by WackenhutCorp. The committee claims the rights of people seekingpolitical asylum in the U.S. are being deprived at thecenter. In the suit, which doesn't name Wackenhut as adefendant, the committee said it needs the documents todetermine if standards set for the center are being met.   Arthur Helton, director of the committee's refugeeproject, said the center in Queens, N.Y., is mainly used todetain people from Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and other countriesafter they arrive at Kennedy International Airport. Mr.Helton said the detainees are seeking political asylumbecause they have been persecuted or tortured in theircountries.   &quot;Most of the cases ultimately win asylum, but most areheld in detention a year or two years before they win,&quot; hesaid.   Mr. Helton said conditions at the facility are inadequatefor people being held for long periods of time. He also saidthat problems at the center, including its inconvenientlocation, make it difficult for detainees to get legalrepresentation. He said the facility lacks outdoor exercisefacilities, language programs, and medical personnel who canspeak the detainees' languages.   A spokesman for the INS said the Wackenhut center &quot;is asafe facility where humane treatment is the rule.&quot; He saidefforts are being made to make it easier for the detainees tocontact attorney.s   ---   THREE PARTNERS for banking and finance joined Paul,Hastings, Janofsy andamp; Walker's New York office.
