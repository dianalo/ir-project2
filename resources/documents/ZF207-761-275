(The Hard Edge)(column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Helliwell, John.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Users who must exit and enter their systems through a series ofcomplicated procedures are the targets of a new pair ofuninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems.andP;  Universal VectorsCorp markets an external power supply called the Unisaver 100 thatis an external device connected through an AT add-in board.andO;Through the use of the board, on the market since late 1988, workis saved through battery backup even if a system is cut off fromelectric power.andP;  Universal's board, however, is an expensiveadd-on at $995.andP;  Pan Overseas Technology Corp will include a UPSintegrated within its new series of Intel 80386-based Echo386microcomputers that will be introduced in the fall of 1989.andP;  Thenew microcomputers will include a UPS board as standard equipment.andO;The volume of boards will represent only about $150 in the cost ofthe system.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Pan Overseas Technology Corp.
