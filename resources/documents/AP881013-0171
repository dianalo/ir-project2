The political science department issued a statement supportingthe faculty of the law school, which earlier this week denouncedpolice action during student protests in September and called for areview of the deportation on Friday of Shadrack Gutto, aKenyan-born lecturer at the school.   Hundreds of riot police with dogs, batons and tear gas broke upthe Sept. 29 demonstrations by thousands of university studentsprotesting alleged government corruption in Zimbabwe.   Hospital officials said scores of police and students wereinjured in clashes and more than 480 people were arrested in thebloodiest violence since Zimbabwe won its independence from Britainin 1980. Students said police attacked them without warning.   On Oct. 6, the Home Affairs Ministry gave Gutto 48 hours toleave the country. The Kenyan, who for six years taught at the lawschool and advocated radical socialist policies, was accused ofbeing an illegal immigrant. He flew to London on Friday.   The political science faculty said in Thursday's statement theywere ``greatly disturbed'' at police treatment of studentdemonstrators and Gutto's deportation ``without due process.''   The president of the University's Students RepresentativeCouncil, Edgar Mwembwe, said Thursday that police attacks onprotesters were like ``police brutality in South Africa.''   On Wednesday, the law school faculty issued a statementprotesting police behavior and requesting a meeting with PresidentRobert Mugabe to discuss the expulsion of Gutto. Some students andprofessors said they believed the Kenyan was kicked out becauseauthorities believed he fanned the unrest.   Mugabe has defended his government against corruption charges,saying there was no evidence justifying the protests.   Students and lecturers have been major supporters of Mugabe'sZimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic Front) and itssocialistic policies since the president led Zimbabwe toindependence on April 18, 1980.   But student leader Mwembwe said the demonstrations were ``notthe end but just the beginning of what is to come _ the capaignagainst corruption, negligence of duty, betrayal and paying of lipservice to the goals and aspirations the nation has set towardssocialism.''   He insisted no faculty members, including Gutto, were involvedin the September protests.</TEXT></DOC>
