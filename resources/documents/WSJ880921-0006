Campbell and his company, A.F. Campbell andamp; Co., should be enjoined from promoting research and development tax shelters that may have cost the government as much as $60 million in tax revenue.    In a 36-page decision, U.S. Judge A. Joe Fish wrote that Mr. Campbell grossly overvalued the research contracts he sold and made false and fraudulent statements about the contracts, which were sold through a Brazilian entity known as Coral.    Under the shelter, investors were to pay one-eighth of the $600,000 research fee in cash and the remainder in a promissory note payable in Brazilian currency, which the judge noted had little economic value. Further, he said, only about $3.6 million of the $18 million collected in cash down payments on the research contracts was used for research, while about $6.5 million was paid as commissions, fees or loans.    But because Mr. Campbell and his company led investors to believe the full contract price was deductible, investors could have taken as much as $120 million in unallowable tax deductions, costing the government $60 million in lost revenue if the taxpayers were in the 50% bracket, the judge said.    The opinion was based on a civil trial in October and February. An Internal Revenue Service spokeswoman said that criminal charges haven't been filed against Mr. Campbell or his company.    In Dallas, Mr. Campbell said that he was &quot;shocked and enormously disappointed&quot; by the decision but hadn't had a chance to study it. He added that sales of the research and development tax shelters were stopped more than three years ago, before the government brought its case against him.    Mr. Campbell's attorney, John A. Price, said that the opinion is &quot;not supported by the evidence presented at trial&quot; and that Mr. Campbell intends to appeal.    James E. Carroll, a Boston lawyer who was a trial lawyer for the Justice Department, said the case is the largest tax-shelter scheme that a special task force investigating such shelters has pursued. </TEXT></DOC>
