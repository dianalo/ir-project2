Under the proposal,the importer of these vehicles, known as a direct importer, would be requiredto use one of the unique coding identifiers that the original manufacturerassigned to the vehicle in lieu of using the 17-character VIN requiredto be placed on vehicles originally manufactured for sale in this country.Currently, many direct importers assign a ``homemade'' 17-character VINto their imports to meet Standard 115 requirements.Under this proposal, the importer would have to place a statement in thevehicle passenger compartment informing interested persons that the vehiclewas partially exempt from Standard 115, and directing them to the sidedoor post. At the side door post, there would be a permanently affixedlabel stating where an interested person could find the original manufacturer'snumber that would be used in lieu of the VIN.The agency is taking this action in response to a National Automobile TheftBureau petition stating that ``homemade'' VINs pose a problem particularlywith respect to vehicles of the same model that are imported both by theoriginal manufactuer and by direct importers. The 17-character VINs addedby direct importers are so dissimilar in appearance from VINs on similarvehicles manufactured for sale in the United States that law enforcementofficers may mistake them for altered VINs; that these homemade VINs createproblems for insurance investigators; and that encoding errors in these``homemade'' VINs disrupt the integrity of the VIN system.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comment closing date: June 27, 1988.<T3>Proposed effective date: </T3>November 9, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments should refer to Docket No. 88-08; Notice 1,and be submitted to: Docket Section, NHTSA, Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street,SW., Washington, DC 20590.

Title 19 CFR 12.80 is a joint Transportation/Treasury regulationsetting forth those terms and conditions. Subparagraph (b)(1)(iii) of thatregulation requires that a person seeking to bring a nonconforming import(direct import vehicle) into the United States file a declaration (madeby marking block 3 on the U.S. Customs form) that the vehicle will be modifiedso as to conform with applicable safety standards. Among those Standardsis 115, <T3>Vehicle Identification Number_Basic Requirements.</T3>The National Automobile Theft Bureau (NATB or petitioner) petitioned theagency to amend Standard 115 to address problems arising when these directimporters create a VIN and a VIN plate using an identification number andplate machining process other than the ones which the original vehiclemanufacturer uses. First, there is an increased prospect of encoding errorsin a homemade VIN because an importer may not record the proper chassisnumber or serial number when he creates the VIN plate. Second, becausea homemade VIN plate frequently looks different from the plate that anoriginal manufacturer puts on similar vehicles, law enforcement officialsmistake the former as an altered plate. Apparently, machining a VIN plateis difficult for some importers. Further, petitioner states that an individualin lawful possession of a direct import vehicle may find himself subjectedto criminal charges because of the appearance of these homemade VINs.The petitioner recommended that NHTSA take actions to accomplish the following:first, the direct importer must not create its own ``VIN.'' If the originalmanufacturer has placed any kind of identification number plate in thepassenger compartment where Standard 115 would otherwise require a 17-characterVIN plate or importer-created ``VIN'' plate, the original manufacturer'splate would serve as the vehicle's ``VIN'' plate. Among the original manufacturernumbers that one might use in place of the United States VIN are the Europeanvehicle identification number (EuroVIN), the World Market vehicle identificationnumber (WorldVIN), the chassis number, or the vehicle serial number. NATBsuggested a change to S4.1 to state a clear requirement that a direct importvehicle's VIN <T3>must</T3> be original manufacturer's ``alpha-numeric identifier.''Petitioner continued that because these coded numbers may not be called``VINs'' in Europe, an amendment should ``equate the chassis or serialnumber with the VIN.'' NATB suggested that the agency amend Standard 115,subparagraph S2, <T3>Application, </T3>by exempting direct import vehicles from the requirementin S4.8 regarding the type face to be used for a VIN. Direct import vehiclesalready are exempt from S4.2 [requiring a VIN to have 17 characters], S4.3[requiring encoding a check digit in the VIN], and S4.7 [requiring VINcharacters to be an Arabic or Roman letter set out in Table 1 of the Standard].In support of this requested change, petitioner stated its uncertaintywhether foreign chassis and serial numbers could meet S4.8.Second, if the original manufacturer has not affixed a plate of the typeand in the location described above, then the importer must affix a platein that location stating that the vehicle is ``partially exempt'' fromStandard 115. This plate must refer a person to the driver's door post.Third, when the importer is required to affix the plate regarding partialexemption, then the importer must also affix a label to the driver's doorpost that:(1) Cites the joint Transportation/Treasury regulation under which a persondirectly imports a noncomplying vehicle;(2) Identifies the location on the vehicle of the original manufacturer'snumber to be used in lieu of the 17-character VIN;(3) Gives the name and address of the person who brought the vehicle intocompliance with Standard 115;(4) States the date of importation;(5) States the date of certification; and(6) States the name and address of the person who made the certification.The agency also received letters from eight insurance companies and fromMichigan's Department of State Police, all endorsing the NATB petition.The insurance industry letters further expressed an interest in betteridentifying direct import vehicles, and thus reducing the risk of fraudulenttheft losses.<ITAG tagnum="84">Agency Response</ITAG>NHTSA acknowledges that there are some problems with the VINs on directimport vehicles, and recognizes that an accurate and reliable vehicle identificationsystem is essential to facilitate vehicle theft investigation, to discourageinsurance fraud, and to maintain the integrity of notice-and-recall campaigns.In the preamble to the final rule adopting the Federal motor vehicle theftprevention standard (49 CFR Part 541) the agency set forth the followingdiscussion:<ITAG tagnum="21">While the NCIC tracking system could more readily handle full 17-characterVIN's, the usefulness of those VINs would be substantially diminished ifthey do not allow law enforcement personnel to trace the vehicle to itsmanufacturer. The Euro-VINs are more difficult for the NCIC to enter, butwill serve to trace the vehicle to its manufacturer. Further, if the agencywere to permit or require assigning U.S. VINs by direct importers, such``homemade'' VINs would not be recorded by the manufacturer as assigned.This could result in a situation where a VIN was assigned to two differentvehicles (once by the vehicle manufacturer and once by the direct importer).Duplicative VINs would completely fail to serve the purpose of providinga unique identifier for a vehicle for 30 years. Therefore, NHTSA has determinedthat vehicles imported by direct importers should be marked with the originalEuro-VIN assigned to the vehicle by the original manufacturer. 50 FR 43166,at 43183; October 24, 1985.</ITAG>For the reasons set forth in this previous discussion, NATB`s petition,and the letters supporting it, the agency proposes to amend Standard 115so that a direct importer needn't create a VIN or VIN plate in order tocomply with United States vehicle identification requirements under 115.NHTSA is proposing to adopt an amendment that substantially reflects thepetitioner's suggestions. However, the agency cannot agree with the suggestionthat <T3>any</T3> extant original manufacturer identifier in the S4.6 locationshould obviate the need for some notice that the vehicle is partially exemptfrom Standard 115. NHTSA declines to create a third category of platesor numbers for law enforcement officials to check in a theft investigation.Further, the agency does not find it desirable to add to the complexityof vehicle identifier location requirements by legitimizing this thirdkind of plate.On the other hand, it is a relatively simple matter to require the affixingof a plate informing an interested person that a vehicle is partially exampt,and referring the person to another label on the door post that would specifythe unique identifying number for the vehicle. Therefore, the agency proposesthat the vehicle must have either the 17-character United States VIN, orplate informing an interested person of the vehicle's partial exemption.NHTSA is not proposing to require that a direct importer remove a Euro-VINor other foreign identifier plate from the vehicle if such a plate is inor near the S4.6 location. The proposal is that where there is no 17-characterVIN plate complying with Standard 115, the additional statement proposedin this notice would be required. Because of this proposed approach, itis unnecessary to consider NATB's suggestion that a Euro-VIN, WorldVIN,chassis, or serial number be exempted from the readability and locationrequirements in S4.6.There is a second matter on which NHTSA's proposal is at variance withthe NATB petition. Petitioner asks that the agency require a lengthy newlabel the purpose of which is to certify compliance with Standard 115.NATB proposes that this label contain information such as a citation to19 CFR 12.80, and information about the person who performed work bringingthe vehicle into compliance with 115.The agency can see no useful purpose in requiring the information NATBsuggests. Requiring a lengthy label neither addresses the problem of mistakenarrests because of legitimate VIN plates that look altered, facilitatesacquiring an identification number to check against the NCIC system inthe course of a theft investigation, supplies a means to check insurancefraud, nor contributes to the integrity of the VIN system.NHTSA believes it would suffice for all these concerns to include a labelthat states where an interested person can find the unique manufactureridentifying number that is used in lieu of the 17-character United StatesVIN, and proposes that simplified requirement in this notice. Further,for consistency, the agency proposes to include labeling requirements underPart 567.While the agency believes this proposal will solve the petitioner's problems,NHTSA also seeks comment, particularly from law enforcement agencies, onwhether the proposed changes could, in some circumstances, increase thefraudulent use of VINs or impede law enforcement actions. For example,in certain situations, vehicles with the proposed FMVSS 115 exemption labelno longer will have a VIN visible through the glazing. NHTSA requests commenton whether this situation creates a law enforcement problem by precludingthe inspection of VINs on parked and locked vehicles.Also, the agency seeks comment on whether the proposal could lead to improperuse of VIN exemption plates (e.g., replacing a legitimate VIN), since,the certain circumstances, it allows an exemption plate where the VIN currentlyis required. Comments are requested on the likelihood of this potentialaction.<ITAG tagnum="84">Impact Assessments</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291NHTSA has considered costs and other factors associated with this proposal,and concludes that this proposed rule is non-major under Executive Order12291. The agency expects this rule to affect a small segment of the automotivecommunity: those who import nonconforming vehicles into the United Statesunder a promise to bring them into compliance. The amendment would requirea plate on the dash in lieu of the 17-character VIN plate the Standardcurrently requires, and a statement on the door post informing an interestedperson where to look for the original manufacturer's unique identifyingnumber that is used in place of the 17-character VIN. NHTSA estimates thatthe per vehicle cost of implementing this amendment would not be significant.For the preceding reasons, the agency believes that the rule would imposeonly nominal costs on a small number of commercial importers and some individuals,and therefore would not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million;would not result in a major increase either in motor vehicle productioncosts or prices; and would not have significant adverse impacts on competitionor market incentives. B. Department of Transportation Procedures for Improving Government RegulationsFor the reasons set out in the preceding discussion, the agency has determinedthat this rule is not significant under DOT procedures. Further, the costsassociated with this proposal, if adopted as a final rule, would be sominimal that preparation of a full regulatory evaluation is unwarranted.C. Small Business ImpactThe Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to evaluate thepotential effects of their proposed and final rules on small businesses,small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions. A substantialnumber of direct importers are individuals importing cars for their ownuse. There are small entities in the direct import business. However, NHTSAanticipates that if this proposal goes into effect, it will not createa new net cost increase since importers already must create a plate witha vehicle identification number. Therefore, the proposal should not resultin other than nominal costs either to small direct import business, orto small entities that may purchase vehicles from any such business. For the preceding reasons, I certify that this proposed rule will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.D. Environmental ImpactUnder the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, NHTSA has consideredthe environmental impact of this proposed rule, and has determined thatthis proposal would not be a major Federal action significantly affectingthe quality of the human environment. E. Executive Order 12612The agency has analyzed this action under the principles and criteria ofExecutive Order 12612, and has determined that the proposed rule does nothave sufficient Federalism implications to warrant preparing a FederalismAssessment. F. Paperwork Reduction ActThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has already approved the NHTSAregulations requiring VINs to appear on all new vehicles (OMB andplusmin;2127-0051). However, this proposal would add requirements for new informationto appear on direct importers' vehicles. This proposed requirement is consideredto be an additional information collection requirement, as that term isdefined by OMB in 5 CFR Part 1320. Accordingly, this proposed requirementwill be submitted to OMB for its approval, pursuant to the requirementsof the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). Comments on the proposed information collection requirementsshould be submitted to: Office of Management and Budget, Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Desk Officer forNHTSA. It is requested that comments sent to the OMB also be sent to theNHTSA rulemaking docket for this proposed action.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>49 CFR Part 571Imports, Motor vehicle safety, Motor vehicles. 49 CFR Part 567Labeling, Motor vehicle safety.
