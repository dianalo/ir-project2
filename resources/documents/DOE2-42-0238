Typically, these &quot;cryogens&quot; are delivered to andhandled weekly at the MR imaging suite. Because they have unusual physicalproperties and are generally unfamiliar to hospital and clinic personnel,they can pose unique hazards. This paper presents, for the first time,a comprehensive and systematic risk analysis of these hazards along withresults and practical recommendations for clinicians. Adherence to theserecommendations will enhance the personal safety of both the MR imagingclinician and the patient, as well as the physical safety of the majorcapital investment.</TEXT></DOC>
