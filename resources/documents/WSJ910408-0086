Tomorrow, two of its closest allies will join one of itsarchrivals to announce a strategy that could threaten Intel'sreign as the world's leading maker of microprocessors forpersonal computers. The allies, Microsoft Corp. and CompaqComputer Corp., helped Intel build its lucrative monopoly inthe chips that act as central commander in most PCs. But nowthey are dividing their loyalties by joining about 20 othercompanies to plan new software that will run, not just onIntel chips, but also on a chip designed by Mips ComputerSystems Inc.</LP><TEXT>   That will be the second offer in a month of an alternativeto Intel's chips. In March, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. beganshipping a chip that mimics the functions of Intel's cash-cowmicroprocessor, the 386. This clone broke Intel's five-yearmonopoly on PCs that use the 386, the most popular PC chip.   Making matters worse, Intel's competitors and customersalike are increasingly irate about what they view as itsdespotic exploitation of its monopoly. Some accuse Intel ofgouging and competing unfairly.   &quot;The most important risk facing Intel today,&quot; writesPrudential Securities analyst Daniel Klesken in anotherwise-glowing report, &quot;is the tremendous animosity amongits customers.&quot;   Although the threats posed by the new alliance, AdvancedMicro's clone and other new superchips are serious, Intel hasa strategy for at least retaining hegemony over the PC chipworld. Rather than hoard its money, it plans to invest it. Itwill spend up to $1 billion this year on plant and equipment,with the aim of slashing production costs and achieving theability to squeeze more circuits onto chips. And it will pour$600 million into research and development. One aim: to cutin half the 3 1/2 years Intel takes to design a new chip.   Intel is pursuing this costly strategy despite therecession, which is making many companies reluctant to spend.Its boldness is reminiscent of the market-share-driven styleof Japanese electronics giants, except that so far Intel hasno significant competition. Starting 1991 with a cash kittyof $1.6 billion and profit margins more than three timesthose of other successful chip makers, Intel can well affordthe blitz.   The company &quot;wants to absolutely dominate the computerindustry as the chip house of the '90s,&quot; says Armond Newton,vice president of workstation marketing at Unisys Corp.&quot;Unless something dramatic happens, it will.&quot;   Even Intel's rivals scoff at talk of it being deposed asmicroprocessor king. &quot;Through the decade, they'll have anenormous share&quot; of the desktop-computer market, says WayneRosing, vice president at Sun Microsystems Inc., which wantsto push its own chips into Intel's markets.   Intel's monopoly harks back to a lucky break in 1980 and astrategic shift five years later. Intel, one of a score ofcompanies hawking microprocessors 11 years ago, got its breakwhen International Business Machines Corp. chose Intel's chipover a number of contenders. IBM's PCs set a standard; theyand their many clones now constitute 80% of the PC market anduse almost exclusively a Microsoft operating system andIntel-designed chips.   Under licensing agreements, other chip companies made eachnew version of Intel's microprocessors -- until 1986. Then,Intel decreed that only it could sell a new breakthroughproduct, the 386. The 386 greatly enhanced a PC's usefulnessand sparked a long-running surge in sales of advancedmachines using the chip. With no competition, Intel's profitmargins on the chip are estimated at more than 80%. Thecompany's annual revenue surged 360% in 10 years to $3.9billion in 1990, and its net income 570%, to $650.3 million.(Intel stock has risen from $28 last fall to over $52 inMarch, but then slipped after downgrades by some securitiesanalysts; it closed Friday at $48.25, off $1, inover-the-counter trading.)   Some Intel customers resent Intel's fat profits. Evenextremely loyal customers resent the company's success inselling its own complete computer systems. Officials at ASTResearch Inc., for instance, were unhappy when the companylost out to Intel on a bid to supply PCs to AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Corp. And AST lost again, to ATandamp;T'sIntel-made machines, in seeking a large contract to supplyAMR Corp.'s American Airlines. Intel's systems businessaccounts for about a quarter of its 1990 revenue.   &quot;It's clearly a conflict of interest&quot; for Intel to sellPCs, says Compaq President Joseph &quot;Rod&quot; Canion, who otherwisepraises Intel as a &quot;cornerstone&quot; supplier. &quot;They're selling akey technology on which our future rests, and to have thatsame company compete with us for the systems business is aconflict.&quot;   Intel has further angered customers by not making enough386 chips to meet the booming demand. Silicon Valley Computersays it had orders for 7,700 of its PCs in the 1991 firstquarter but got only 1,000 chips from Intel. It had to turndown the other 6,700 orders rather than buy chips on the spotmarket for three times list price.   Craig Barrett, an Intel executive vice president,dismisses talk of animosity toward Intel as &quot;jealousy amongour customers&quot; over its success.   If Intel's customers are jealous, its rivals are livid,and some are charging it with antitrust violations. Lastmonth, a federal court in Sherman, Texas, agreed to hear anantitrust suit filed by Cyrix Corp., a Texas maker of mathco-processors, chips that speed up some PC functions. Cyrixsays Intel falsely disparaged Cyrix's chip to Cyrix customersand offered discounts, rebates or promotional allowances todealers &quot;on the condition that they not carry Cyrix mathco-processors.&quot;   In February, Tokyo Cobra Corp., a chip distributor basedin Anaheim, Calif., sued Intel in state court in OrangeCounty, charging that Intel unfairly cut off its supplies ofmath co-processors. Some other California distributors arepreparing joint state and federal antitrust suits againstIntel, which cut off their supplies, too.   Thomas Dunlap, Intel's in-house lawyer, calls theantitrust suits &quot;knee-jerk reactions&quot; by disgruntledcompanies. The distributors were cut off legally as Intelsought to streamline its sales network, he says. &quot;We areentitled to a monopoly in certain areas&quot; through patents andcopyrights, he adds.   But critics charge that Intel uses the courts to milk itsrights for more than they're worth. Intel casts a pall overcompanies that clone its chips by launching barrages of suitsand motions that drag out the litigation for years, they say.By the time a ruling is handed down, the market for the chipmay have vanished. U.S. computer makers avoided NEC Corp.'sIntel-compatible chips, for instance, while the Japanesecompany was battling Intel in the courts over certaincopyrights. The judge ruled NEC had the right to sell itschip, but by then the opportunity was gone.   Intel's critics got a bit of vindication last October,when an arbitrator in Santa Clara ruled that Intel had actedin bad faith by secretly deciding to scotch an agreement thatcould have given Advanced Micro Devices the right to makecopies of the 386 chip. The arbitrator, retired Judge J.Barton Phelps, wrote that Intel's actions were &quot;a classicexample of a breach of the covenant of good faith and fairdealing, preaching good faith but practicing duplicity.&quot;   Intel's Mr. Dunlap denies that Intel secretly decided toditch the pact. He says the deal fell apart because AMD, asAdvanced Micro Devices is known, didn't deliver chips it hadpromised.   AMD was counting on the agreement to provide it with abadly needed microprocessor, says W.J. Sanders, its chiefexecutive, who blames each of its seven quarterly lossessince 1987 on &quot;being duped by Intel.&quot; Judge Phelps hasn't yetdecided whether AMD is entitled to monetary damages or theright to make Intel's 386.   Mr. Sanders is taking another whack at Intel with AMD's386 clone, the first of several clones expected to hit themarket this year. AMD says it has shipped tens of thousandsof its clones, which are 21% faster than Intel's fastest 386sbut cost the same. AMD has a track record of using clones totake business from Intel, and, despite Intel's legalchallenges, analysts expect AMD to get as much as 10% of themarket for 386 chips by year end.   Computer makers are rejoicing, believing that competitionwill force Intel to cut prices and offer more and betterchips. &quot;Every single person, no matter how close he is toIntel, is very, very glad there's competition,&quot; says AkramChowdry, president of PC maker Mylex Corp., who calls Intel'smonopoly profits &quot;exorbitant.&quot;   Meanwhile, Intel's biggest long-term challenge comes froma new breed of fast microprocessors. Sun and Mips havecreated a small but booming market for the new chips, whichuse technologies collectively called reduced-instruction-setcomputing (RISC). One of the latest entries, a $12,000Hewlett-Packard Co. machine using H-P's own RISC chip, runsup to 10 times faster than similarly priced systems usingIntel's latest chip, the 486. As RISC-computer prices fall,some observers think the machines will woo users fromIntel-based PCs.   The latest RISC threat comes from theCompaq-Microsoft-Mips alliance. Tomorrow, the companies, plusothers including Digital Equipment Corp., will announce plansto develop and use operating-system software that runs onboth Intel's chips and Mips' RISC chip, which Compaq isexpected to build into some future machines. The group alsohas agreed on some specifications for Mips-based machines.Backing a new chip is a major departure for Compaq andMicrosoft, whose fortunes were long tied to Intel's. But bothwant to go beyond their PC markets into the booming marketfor the RISC machines that are replacing older minicomputersand mainframes.   In the 1990s, &quot;RISC will play an absolutely major role inthe revolution of information technology,&quot; says EnricoPesatori, president of Zenith Data Systems Corp., a unit ofFrance's Compagnie des Machines Bull. Like most computerexecutives, though, he doesn't &quot;see it eating rapidly&quot; intoIntel's market. Software that runs on both Intel and Mipschips won't get to market for at least a year.   Intel failed in trying to sell its own RISC chip, the 860,as a computer &quot;brain.&quot; It couldn't persuade computer makersto build machines around the chip, which was more than a yearbehind rival RISC chips and wasn't originally designed as acentral processor. And Intel alienated PC-making customerswho feared it was slighting the further refinement of the 386and 486 -- the &quot;x86&quot; line -- that PCs use.   Therein lies one of Intel's flaws, observers say. Itsexecutives tend to become so enamored of their technologicalprowess as to stray from what customers really want. Thathappened in 1989, when Intel tried to enter the Unixworkstation market, only to withdraw a year later afterselling few of its machines. It was even costlier when Intelwrote off $35 million to abandon a joint venture, aimed atcracking the big computer market, with Siemens AG.   &quot;We were mesmerized by the technological power of the860,&quot; concedes Andrew Grove, Intel's president and chiefexecutive. &quot;We confused ourselves as much as we confused therest of the world.&quot;   Mr. Grove says Intel has refocused its heavy investmentson its cash-cow x86 line. It will respond to the AMD clonethis year with several low-cost, higher-speed versions of itsleading-edge 486 chip, which runs typical PC programs two tothree times faster than 386 machines.   AMD is expected to counterattack with a clone of the 486next year. But Intel plans to fend off AMD -- and the RISCattack -- with a new-generation 586 chip, also due out nextyear, that would match the power of the Mips chip and embodysome RISC techniques, such as processing several instructionsat once.   Yet another incarnation, the 686, is already in the works,thanks to Intel's moves to speed up development work. Untillast year, Intel designed each new generation of chips inSanta Clara, and development teams couldn't concentrate on anew chip until the old design was out the door. Now, whileengineers finish the 586, a new team in Portland, Ore., hasbegun designing the 686. And Intel plans to open anotherchip-development lab in Japan.   Intel also is trying to take more business away from otherchip makers, and possibly from its own customers, byshrinking an entire PC into a chip -- by combining amicroprocessor &quot;core&quot; with all the important circuits nowcontained in dozens of more generic chips. PCs would becomefaster, cheaper and smaller.   Intel is already accounting for more and more of theinsides of the PC. About a year after the company introducedits predecessor 286 chip in 1982, the price of the chip madeup less than a tenth of the cost of materials in a basic PC&quot;motherboard,&quot; Mylex's Mr. Chowdry says. Today, an Intel 486accounts for about half of the cost of a similar motherboard.   Intel's dominance inside the PC will grow as its newfactories fit more transistors on a single chip. Intelexpects its 586 chip to hold about four million transistors,up from 1.2 million in its 486. In the mid-1990s, Intel chipscould combine the circuits of the 486 with the RISC circuitsof the 860, the company says. And by the year 2000, itexpects to have 100 million transistors on a chip. Theability to &quot;integrate&quot; more circuits will enable Intel tomake up for RISC chips' superior designs.   To keep up with Intel in the 1990s, a chip company mustown the rights to a microprocessor core and be able tocombine that core on a single chip with other circuits, saysGordon Campbell, president of Chips andamp; Technologies Inc.,which is expected to unveil a 386 clone soon. &quot;You eitherfigure out a way to do that, or you cease to exist in themarket,&quot; he adds.   However, Intel's Mr. Grove says few competitors can affordthe huge investments his company is making. He adds thatIntel isn't afraid of the Compaq-Microsoft-Mips alliancebecause computer buyers, not such groups, set the kind ofstandard Intel has become. &quot;Volume begets standards, not theother way around,&quot; he says.   Intel certainly has volume, and the resultant economies ofscale. Last year, it sold about 7.5 million 386 and 486chips, compared with only 387,000 of all types of RISC chipssold, according to Dataquest Inc., a market-research firm.RISC chips &quot;are going to nibble away&quot; at the computer market,says Thomas Arnold, vice president of ATandamp;T's Entry-LevelSystems business unit. But because of Intel's huge user base-- some 80 million computers run on Intel-designed chips --&quot;the x86 is here for the long term,&quot; he says.   ---       Licensed manufacturers of selected Intel chips                                                                                                                      YEAR CHIP          SHIPPED                                                                                                        8088          1976        Intel, AMD, Fujitsu, Harris,NEC, Oki, Siemens and IBM*                                                                                                        80286         1982        Intel, AMD, Fujitsu, Harris,                           Siemens and IBM*                                                                                                        80386         1986        Intel and IBM*                                                                                                        80486         1989        Intel                                                                                                          Source: Intel   *For IBM use only                                                                                                        Planned 1991 capital expenditures of the top semiconductormakers, in millions of dollars                                                                                                        Intel                          900 NEC                            680 Toshiba                        680 Motorola                       640 Fujitsu                        570 Hitachi                        570                                                                                                          Source: Dataquest</TEXT></DOC>
