PUGH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEWTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The son of a man extradited for Nazi warcrimes confronted the federal investigators who helped send hisfather to Yugoslavia at an international conference Sunday on theHolocaust.   Radoslav Artukovic said the Nazi-hunting Office of SpecialInvestigations built the case against his father, AndrijaArtukovic, by relying on forged documents.   Officials of the OSI, a U.S. Justice Department agency whoserole in the extradition is under federal investigated, deny theallegation.   The fifth annual Boston College law school conference on theHolocaust and human rights law was attended by prosecutors,academics and Nazi hunters, including Beate Klarsfeld of France. Inthe Holocaust during World War II the Nazis systematically killed 6million Jews, as well as homosexuals, Gypsies and others consideredundesirable.   Andrija Artukovic was extradited in 1986. Dubbed the ``Butcherof the Balkans,'' he was convicted in Yugoslavia of ordering thedeaths of more than 1,000 people and of complicity in hundreds ofthousands of other concentration camp deaths. He died of naturalcauses in a prison hospital in 1988 while awaiting execution.   Artukovic claims his father was innocent and has repeatedlyquestioned the extradition.   On Sunday, the Los Alamitos, Calif., stockbroker and formermilitary police investigator accused the OSI team of relying onfalsified evidence from a communist country in order to extraditehis father.   The elite unit was able to extradite the senior Artukovicbecause extradition is performed at the request of a foreigncountry. It doesn't require due process in a U.S. court.   Artukovic said he had State Department cables suggesting the OSIsolicited the Yugoslavian request for his father's extradition.   OSI Deputy Director Bruce Einhorn denied the accusations at theconference.   ``OSI does not operate a service for begging and demandingextradition from other countries,'' he said. ``Other countries aregrown up ... they have to make the decision about whether they wantsomeone extradited.''   Artukovic also accused the OSI of holding back facts that wouldhave discredited affidavits from several witnesses whose testimonywas crucial to the extradition.   In addition, Artukovic said, OSI officials misled a Los Angelescourt by de-emphasizing the office's role in soliciting informationfrom Yugoslavia about Artukovic.   The Justice Department has confirmed in written replies tomembers of Congress that internal auditors in the Office ofProfessional Responsibility have begun investigating theallegations.   Einhorn declined to comment on the investigation.   ``As far as were concerned, we think the case should be over,''he said. ``We deny that anyone at OSI committed any misconduct. Webelieve our office acted properly and we believe the courts''support that.   Artukovic said he undertook his crusade because he wants hisfather's body back from the Yugoslavian government, which hasrefused to return it.</TEXT></DOC>
