Klein's article on the Masters Golf Tournament (Leisure andamp; Arts, April 12): In his unabashed admiration for the Masters and its &quot;Gentlemen of the Green,&quot; he extols the merits of a sporting gesture by one of the athletes who, upon learning he had been credited with shooting 74 in a tournament when he knew he shot a 75, disqualified himself. Praiseworthy perhaps, but it does come to mind, with that lofty score, he undoubtedly stood little chance. Anyway, Mr. Klein goes on to ask, &quot;Can you think of another sport where a guy'd do something like that?&quot; He then conveniently proclaims, &quot;No.&quot;    Well, guess what? In the French Open a few years ago Mats Wilander was recipient of a shot called wide. That call gave him the title. He steadfastly refused to accept the call and the championship, insisting his opponent's shot was good and the match should continue. It did and justifiably Mats prevailed. How about that &quot;rareness of behavior from a competing athlete&quot;?    And, by the way, if professional golfers are athletes, so too are professional pool and billiards players.    Rod Zetko   Syracuse, N.Y.    ---   For the majority of us weekend golfers, any golf course is a major test; and three-putt greens and missed fairways are par for the course.    It is hard for me to understand the touring pros' complaints about the condition of the greens at Augusta National. The Masters is a major test of the golfers' ability, and Augusta National should not be set up like a normal tour course designed for low scores. After all, aren't these golfers supposed to be the best in the world?    Robert G. Ross   Houston   ---   Is there a Pulitzer Prize for sports writing? Mr. Klein should receive recognition for his interesting and witty writing about all aspects of sports.    Anna M. Stillwell   Portsmouth, Ohio</TEXT></DOC>
