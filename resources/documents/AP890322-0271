(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Living off the land has been a way of lifefor generations in Costilla County, the most impoverished inColorado _ where jobs are scarce and low-paying and the San LuisValley teems with game.   ``We used to own these mountains, all the way from Fort Garlandto New Mexico. The people had the freedom to go and hunt for aliving and fish and get wood. It's been here for 150 years ormore,'' said Jerry Sanchez of Chama.   That came to an abrupt end March 6, when 275 heavily armedfederal and state wildlife off by planes andhelicopters, swarmed through the valley before dawn in a raidcapping a 2{-year poaching investigation.   ``I woke up and thought it was an invasion, maybe of aliens, orRicers, supportedussians,'' recalled Sanchez. ``Then I found out it wasourgovernment.''   U.S. Attorney Mike Norton, who coordinated the raid, said thetactics were to protect agents. ``We will not tolerate the theft ofthe public's wildlife resources. We will use every available legalmeans to stop this activity.''   Agents swept through such small towns as San Luis, Chama and FortGarland in Colorado, and Costilla, Questa, Amalia and Mora in NewMexico. By the time they were doning poaching,'' said Sanchez. ``It's againstthe law and people should be penalized. It's the way they handledthe situation, the tactics they used, the guerrilla tactics. We'renot bad people here.''   The operation was ``completely out of proportion,'' said countyCoroner Charles Mondragon, an eighth-generation resident of thevalley. The county was ``terrorized because of the actions of ahandful of poachers,'' he said.   Older citizens on isolated farms were terrified by armed men``crawling across their fields with military-type uniforms on,''said San Luis town trustee Augustin Jaramillo.   Many of those arrested are claiming entrapment, saying they wouldnot have violated the game laws if the government hadn't created amarket. Some said they were openly encouraged by ``Morgan'' to killwild game and eagles.   Galen Buterbaugh, regional director of the U.S. Fish and WildlifeService, said the agent bought only enough to get evidence for eachcase.   Robert Espinoza, a former deputy sheriff, was cited with 33counts of game violations. He was indicted March 17 on federalfelonies of conspiracy, wire fraud, illegal sale of bald and goldeneagles, talons and an elk head.   ``One animal will prove you guilty,'' said one suspect, who spokeon condition of anonymity. ``They didn't have to go and have someoneliterally slaughter 20, 30, maybe 40 eagles to come out and try toprove the point that the guy is a poacher. It just takes one eagleto lock a guy behind bars.''   The San Luis Town Council asked Gov. Roy Romer to investigate``the extreme measures.'' Wildlife agents defeated their cause ``bycreating a market for the purchase of wildlife from unsuspectingvictims of entrapment,'' it said.   Romer appointed a four-member state commission to investigate,and U.S. Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., asked the House Oversight andInvestigations subcommittee to look into the methods used in theraid.   Romer was told of the raid beforehand, but said, ``I did not knowthere was going to be that kind of force concentrated in one place.''   He has refused to judge the way the raid was carried out, butsaid, ``I am sensitive to the reactions of a community to thatdegree of intrusion into their lives, that degree of presence. It'sa frightening experience.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for PMs March 27</NOTE></DOC>
