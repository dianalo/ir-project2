Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation ofTeachers, said that even in the inner cities, parochial schoolseducate ``a select group.''   ``They are kids who will sit still, who will keep quiet, whowill bring their homework in, who will wear a tie or certain typeof uniform and whose parents are willing to put up a couple ofhundred bucks, even if it's a very small amount,'' said Shanker.   Catholic and other religious schools have been stymied in thecourts and in Congress in their efforts to secure more governmentsupport. Three of the past four presidents _ Richard Nixon, JimmyCarter and Ronald Reagan _ promised wider help. None has delivered.   Reagan has frequently extolled the idea of tuition tax credits,but he has been unable to obtain them. The administration alsobelieves strongly in giving parents wider choice in education, butlately it has been talking primarily about choice among publicschools.   The 1965 legislation that provided remedial aid fordisadvantaged children specifically allowed religious schools totake part. But a 5-4 ruling by the Supreme Court drove the remedialclasses out of Catholic school buildings and into vans or othersites off the premises.   Minority enrollment in Catholic schools has doubled since 1970.Blacks, Hispanics and other minorities now comprise 22 percent ofall students. Sixty-four percent of the 234,300 black pupils arenot Catholic.   Studies by James Coleman, a University of Chicago sociologist,and others have found Catholic students out-performing their publicschool counterparts on the National Assessment of EducationalProgress reading and writing tests. The gap between the averageperformance of black and white pupils is narrower than in publicschools.   Coleman, in a study on the high school Class of 1982, found thedropout rate between the sophomore and senior year was 14 percentfor public school students, but only 3.4 percent for those inCatholic school.   Valerie Lee, a University of Michigan education professor, says,``There is an institutional pull toward academic pursuits inCatholic schools for all students, regardless of their ethnic,social and academic background, that we do not see in the publicschools.''   Fifty-four of the 149 students at Most Precious Blood are black.Among them is 13-year-old Alethia Henson, a seventh grader. ``Allthe schools I go to close down,'' she said.   This is the third Catholic school that has gone under for her.   The Rev. Joseph Hughes, the third pastor at Most Precious Bloodin as many years, says, ``One reason we hate to see our schoolleave here is that this is our greatest evangelization tool...Mostof the people moving into the community are black, so it would be areal opportunity to start building, but we couldn't possibly affordto hang in there long enough to do anything like that.''   Before becoming a priest, Hughes was a cost analyst for theRouse Co. ``As soon as I arrived and started looking at papers Irealized that, oh, my goodness, this doesn't seem like this is veryresponsible in a parish this size carrying this much of a financialburden.''   The principal of Most Precious Blood, Dorothy Parker, saysenrollment had dropped from more than 200 four years ago to 149this year.   She expects most of her pupils to transfer to St. Anthony ofPadua School, 2{ miles away. The parishes and parents' groups havearranged a union. St. Anthony has 416 students now and a capacityof 700; its tuition is somewhat higher.   The nine teachers on Parker's staff earn from $12,000 to$18,000. Three are newlyweds without children, but some are womenraising families by themselves.   Lynda Miller, who teaches math and science to the upper grades,had her application in with Baltimore city and county schools evenbefore the news came of the closing.   Miller said, ``It puts a lot of stress on a person. The emotionsvary. It runs from anger. You're angry because the hierarchy whoappears on the outside to care, when it comes down to the gutlevel, sometimes it seems like they really don't.''   Miller and her former husband pay $1,900 to send their daughterto a Catholic high school. She calls Most Precious Blood ``a veryclose, family-type school where God is brought into their lifethroughout, not just in religion class.''   But she says, ``I'll be honest, if I were in the county andthere was a good public school system, I'd send my kid to publicschool.'' She fears that Catholic schools ``will turn more intoprivate, private schools where only the rich will be able to affordit.''   END ADV for Sunday, May 15</TEXT></DOC>
