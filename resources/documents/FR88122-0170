(These changes would also affect the premiumdue dates for multiemployer plans.) The Pension Protection Act, a partof the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, establishes a new premiumstructure for covered single-employer plans that is effective with respectto plan years beginning after December 31, 1987. Under the new rules, thepremium includes a flat per capita assessment (as under prior law), plusan additional assessment based on the value of a plan's unfunded vestedbenefits. Because the variable rate portion of the premium is based upona plan's unfunded vested benefits, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporationhas determined that it would be unduly burdensome and costly to requireplans to pay this portion of the premium by the due dates established inthe premium regulation (for plans with 500 or more participants, the lastday of the second month following the close of the prior plan year, andfor smaller plans, the last day of the seventh month following the closeof the prior plan year). Accordingly, in another document in this issueof the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> plan sponsors and plan administrators (of bothsingle-employer and multiemployer plans) are advised of the suspensionof certain of the premium due dates for plan years beginning on or afterJanuary 1, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>January 22, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Patrick Devereux, Corporate Policyand Research Department [Code 35100], Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,2020 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20006; 202-778-8850 (202-778-8859 forTTY and TDD only.)

L. 100-203 (the ``Budget Act''), includes the Pension ProtectionAct, which amends the pension plan funding and plan termination and relatedprovisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended(``ERISA''). One of the major changes under the law is in the premium rulesapplicable to single-employer plans covered under Title IV of ERISA. Undersection 9331 of the Budget Act, the premiums paid to the Pension BenefitGuaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') for single-employer plans will be composedof a flat per capita assessment (as under prior law) (Budget Act section9331(a)) and a variable rate assessment based on the value of a plan'sunfunded vested benefits (section 9331(b)). The amount of the per capitaassessment is raised to $16 per participant (amended ERISA section 4006(a)(3)(A)(i));the variable rate assessment (which is also determined on a per participantbasis) is $6 for each $1,000 (or fraction thereof) of unfunded vested benefitsdivided by the number of plan participants (amended ERISA section 4006(a)(3)(E)(i) and (ii)). The variable rate portion of the premium may in no eventexceed $34 per participant. (This ceiling is further reduced for planswith respect to which the contributing sponsor has made the maximum deductiblecontributions (under Internal Revenue Code section 404) during at leastone plan year of the five plan years immediately preceding the effectivedate of the new premium rules (section 4006(a)(3)(E)(iv)(II)). The newpremium rates apply for plan years beginning after December 31, 1987.Finally, the Budget Act (in section 9331(c)) also expands liability forthe payment of premiums by providing that a plan's contributing sponsorand each member of the contributing sponsor's controlled group are jointlyand severally liable for premiums required to be paid by the contributingsponsor.The procedures (including due dates) for the payment of premiums are establishedby the PBGC pursuant to ERISA section 4007(a). Under its payment of premiumsregulation (29 CFR Part 2610), the premium owed for a plan year is basedon the participant count for the prior plan year. The premium due datefor large plans, i.e., those with 500 or more participants, is the lastday of the second month following the close of the prior plan year. (Thus,for a calendar year plan, the 1988 premium is based on the participantcount for 1987 and is due by February 29, 1988.) However, because an accurateparticipant count for the prior plan year is frequently not available bythe due date, large plans may also make a reconciliation filing (payingan additional amount or requesting a refund of an overpayment) no laterthan the last day of the seventh month following the close of the priorplan year. For small plans_those with fewer than 500 participants_the premiumis due by the last day of the seventh month following the end of the priorplan year.This payment schedule is not well-suited to the new variable rate assessment.Calculation of the variable rate portion of the premium requires a determinationof a plan's unfunded vested benefits for the prior plan year. In orderto avoid making plans obtain a special actuarial valuation for this purpose,the PBGC has instead decided to permit plans to use the data used in preparingthe Form 5500. (It is noted that the unfunded vested benefits figure usedfor premium purposes will generally be different from that reported onthe 5500, Schedule B, because, <T3>inter alia,</T3> a different interest rate will be used.) In orderto make this possible, it is necessary to revise the premium payment scheduleto conform to the Form 5500 filing date used by many plans.In considering modifications to the premium payment schedule, the PBGCwas also mindful of its obligation under Title IV of ERISA ``to maintainpremiums established * * * under section 4006 at the lowest level consistentwith carrying out [the PBGC's] obligations under this title'' (ERISA section4002(a)(3)). On this basis, the PBGC concluded that the deferral of thepremium due dates is only warranted when it results in significant savingsin administrative costs for the public or the PBGC. Therefore, at presentthe PBGC has decided that it would not be appropriate to revise the currentpremium due dates for larger plans with respect to the $16 per capita premiumcharge. Paying this portion of the 1988 premium entails no greater administrativecosts than such plans incurred in prior years, while retaining the economicbenefit for the PBGC and other premium payors of the current premium duedate for large plans.In order to revise the premium due dates to better accommodate the newvariable rate portion of the premium, the PBGC will undertake a rulemakingto amend the premium regulation. This notice, however, advises plan sponsorsand administrators of certain interim steps the PBGC is taking to effectuatesuch revision and to provide some guidance with respect to the new rulesbeing considered by the PBGC.Accordingly, the PBGC hereby advises contributing sponsors and plan administratorsof large plans (500 or more participants) that for plan years beginningon or after January 1, 1988, the per capita portion of the premium continuesto be due in accordance with the existing rule in andSection;2610.3(a)(6)(ii);that due date is suspended with respect to the variable rate portion ofthe premium. The due date for any reconciliation of the per capita portionis similarly suspended. For plans with fewer than 500 participants, thedue date for the entire premium (set forth in andSection;2610.3(a)(6)(i))is suspended. The PBGC currently contemplates changing all of the foregoingdue dates that are suspended to the date 8\1/2\ months after the closeof the prior plan year.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\The PBGC would use an 8\1/2\ month deadline because, inpractice, that is the Form 5500 filing deadline for many plans.For new plans or plans newly covered under Title IV, and for plans forwhich the plan year that began in 1987 was a short plan year, the PBGCis also suspending the due dates for the initial premium payment and the1988 premium payment, respectively. For a plan for which the first planyear beginning after December 31, 1987 is a short plan year, the due datesapplicable to large plans and small plans, as modified herein, would continueto apply (andSection;2610.3(a)(8)). The amended regulation will provide additionalguidance to all such plans.The PBGC plans to make parallel changes to the premium due dates for multiemployerplans. Although the new premium rate structure does not apply to multiemployerplans, it would be more costly for the PBGC to administer different paymentschedules for multiemployer and single-employer plans. Therefore, withrespect to multiemployer plans for plan years beginning after December31, 1987, the PBGC is suspending each payment due date under andSection;2610.3that is seven months after the close of the prior plan year; the two-monthdeadline generally applicable to large plans is not affected.The PBGC recognizes that the public has many questions concerning the newvariable rate premium, and the PBGC is committed to responding to thosequestions as fully and promptly as possible. The PBGC is still developingmany of the details of the new rules. The PBGC can provide some guidance,however, on the valuation of vested benefits for premium purposes.Under amended ERISA section 4006 (a)(3)(E)(iii)(II), vested benefits arevalued using an interest rate equal to 80% of the annual yield on 30-yearTreasury securities for the month preceding the first month of the planyear for which the premium is being paid. The PBGC contemplates using forthis 30-year yield the interest rate for 30-year Treasury constant maturities,as reported in Federal Reserve Statistical Release G.13 or H.15.In calculating unfunded vested benefits, the value of plan assets is substractedfrom the value of vested benefits. The PBGC currently plans to permit theuse, for the purpose of this calculation, of the actuarial value of theplan assets held in the trust without reducing this value by the creditbalance (if any) in the funding standard account. This reduction has significanceonly for purposes of the minimum funding standards, and it would undulyincrease the amount of unfunded vested benefits, thus increasing the variablerate portion of the premium.Along with revising the premium regulation, the PBGC will also revise thePBGC Form 1, Annual Premium Payment. The PBGC intends to issue the amendedregulation and from in time to enable plan sponsors and administratorsto calculate and pay 1988 premiums in accordance with the new due datesto be established. (A new short form for large plans to use with theirinitial payment of the $16 per capita charge is being sent out by the PBGCthis week.) As noted above, the amended regulation will set forth new paymentdue dates, as well as the specific rules for determining unfunded vestedbenefits for premium calculation purposes.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, the 20th day of January, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Kathleen P.
