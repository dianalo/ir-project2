Inc., which isnegotiating with several other potential buyers, a Dart spokesmansaid Wednesday.   Stop andamp; Shop confirmed Wednesday it had begun talks with severalparties considering a buyout of the supermarket and discount storechain, raising the possibility it might find a ``white knight''friendly suitor to thwart Dart.   Sandy Bouzoukis, a Stop andamp; Shop spokeswoman, declined to name theparties interested in the Braintree-based company.   Dart spokesman Stanley Rubenstein said the Landover, Md.-basedretailing concern would continue its hostile $37 a share, $1.03billion tender offer launched last month. Dart controls about 2.7percent of Stop andamp; Shop's 27.9 million common shares outstanding.   ``Dart's position is unchanged. It is premature to respond to(Stop andamp; Shop) until we know the details of any alternativeproposal,'' said Rubenstein.   Stop andamp; Shop rose $2.37{ to $41.50 a share Wednesday on the NewYork Stock Exchange.   Boston businessman Thomas Lee reportedly is a possible suitor,but neither Lee nor Stop andamp; Shop officials would confirm they werein negotiations.   Stop andamp; Shop directors rejected Dart's $37 a share offer earlierthis month and filed a federal court suit to block the bid,claiming Dart did not fully disclose details of past takeoverattempts and had failed to register as an investment company withthe Securities and Exchange Commission.   Dart countersued, claiming Stop andamp; Shop illegally withheldcorporate information.   U.S. District Judge Rya Zobel ruled Tuesday that Dart must fileits claim in Norfolk Superior Court in Massachusetts, where eightseparate shareholder suits challenging Stop andamp; Shop's anti-takeovermeasures are awaiting a hearing.   Dart has mounted several unsuccessful but profitable hostiletakeover attempts since selling its Washington-based drug storechain in 1985.   The bid for Stop andamp; Shop was Dart's first since it abandoned a $6billion takeover proposal for Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp.following the Oct. 19 stock market crash.   Dart, which owns Crown Books and Trak Auto Parts storesnationwide, also has made unsuccessful but profitable attempts togain control of Safeway Co. and Supermarkets General.   Since 1986, Stop andamp; Shop has sold several unprofitable divisions,including Medi Mart drug stores and Almys department stores, andlaid off about 450 middle-level workers.   The company operates 113 Stop andamp; Shop supermarkets and 169Bradlees discount department stores.</TEXT></DOC>
