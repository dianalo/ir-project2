It accomplishesa radial search from the geometric center of the myocardium. On eachof the 30 profiles, the local maximum of the 1st derivative is selectedas the epicardial edge. The algorithm has been tested in 40 patientsat stress and redistribution. In ten patients, conventional planar imageswere obtained in three views. In 30 patients conventional short axistomographic images were obtained after reconstruction of 32 projectionsacquired over 180/sup 0/. The rate of success is 97% for both imagingmodalities. This procedure is another step towards fully automated assessmentof myocardial defects and redistribution.</TEXT></DOC>
