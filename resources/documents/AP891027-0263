William J. Crawford, commissioner of the California Departmentof Savings and Loans, told the House Banking Committee on Thursdaythat two attempts were made from Washington on behalf of Phoenixbusinessman Charles H. Keating Jr. to approve the sale of Lincolnto a group of investors.   Crawford never approved the sale, described as a ``sham'' byfederal regulator William Black.   Within weeks of the calls, the Irvine, Calif.-based Sandamp;L wastaken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and is expectedto require a $2 billion bailout, making it the nation's costliestthrift failure.   Carolyn Jordan, an aide to Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., urgedapproval of the sale in March. In April, according to Crawford,Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., called Crawford's boss, Business,Transportation and Housing Secretary John Geoghegan.   Crawford said DeConcini called at the instigation of the topfederal thrift regulator, M. Danny Wall.   In an 8{-hour hearing, Crawford and San Francisco-basedofficials of Wall's agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision,detailed Keating's three-year effort to deter them from bringingenforcement action against his institution.   The effort included what they characterized as secret meetingsin 1987 between Keating and Wall as well as the enlistment of fivesenators to plead Lincoln's cause and the hiring of Federal ReserveBoard Chairman Alan Greenspan, then a private economist, as aconsultant to defend the thrift's financial condition.   Michael Patriarca, the thrift office's chief supervisory agentin San Francisco, and Black, counsel in that office, hadrecommended in May 1987 that the government seize Lincoln to endreckless activities and prevent further losses.   Their recommendation was rejected, and in an unprecedented movethe case was transferred from the San Francisco office to agencyheadquarters in Washington. Patriarca and Black said that delayedaction by two years.   ``If our recommendations had been followed, the taxpayers ...would have suffered dramatically smaller losses,'' Black said. ``Itneed not have happened and would not have happened if (regulatorsin Washington) had showed any backbone.''   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the banking panel,said he would ask President Bush to have Wall take administrativeleave during the hearings.   Gonzalez complained that Wall, by having a thrift office lawyermeet earlier this month with Patriarca and Black, was attempting toinfluence their testimony.   In other developments:   _Gonzalez revealed that shortly after the FDIC took over Lincolnthe agency discovered that telephones in an office used byCalifornia state Sandamp;L examiners had been rigged so that others inthe institution could eavesdrop on the examiners' confidentialconversations.   An FDIC memo released by the committee said the matter wasreferred to the FBI for criminal investigation.   Leonard Bickwit, a Washington attorney representing Keating,said corporate officials deny authorizing or participating in phonetampering.   _Patriarca revealed that in an apparent attempt to influencehim, his wife, Laura Patriarca, then an attorney with the thriftoffice, was offered a job with American Continental.   Testimony by Patriarca and Black illustrates Keating's widepolitical reach, which included persuading five senators whosecampaigns he had helped fund to meet with regulators on his behalfin April 1987.   The five are Cranston; DeConcini; John McCain, R-Ariz.; JohnGlenn, D-Ohio; and Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.   Patriarca and Black said the bank board under Wall seemed moreprotective of Keating's interests than of its own field staff.Without informing regulators in San Francisco or asking for theirside of the story, they said Wall and other bank board officialsmet dozens of times with Keating.   In 1984 and 1985, when Keating was fighting a bank board effortto restrict direct commercial and real estate investments bythrifts, he enlisted the help of Greenspan, who in a ``veryinfluential'' letter distributed to members of Congress describedLincoln as a strong institution, Black said.   Patriarca, Black and Crawford appeared at the second of fourscheduled hearings on Lincoln. Keating and Wall are scheduled toappear Nov. 7.</TEXT></DOC>
