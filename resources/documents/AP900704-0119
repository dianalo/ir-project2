Prime ministers Petre Roman of Romania and Andrei Lukanov ofBulgaria agreed at a meeting to set up a joint commission that willwork toward ``diminishing and stopping the pollution caused by theGiurgiu Chemical Plant and the Bulgarian nuclear facility near theborder.''   The two sides undertook to provide each other with exact data onthe disputed facilities within 20 days and to complete a conventionfor protecting the environment along their border before August.   They said world experts will be asked ``to assess the degree ofpollution at the frontier and the measures necessary for removingthe pollution.''   The agreement was announced in a communique released after themeeting.   Thousands of Bulgarians demonstrated along the frontier lastmonth demanding closure of the Giurgiu plant.   Romanians in turn accused the Bulgarians of having insufficientsafety standards at their nearby nuclear plant.   About 500 Bulgarians kept up a protest on their side of theborder for the third day Wednesday, and at 6 p.m. blockedRomania-bound traffic for two hours.   Romania's House of Deputies meanwhile approved Roman's liberalprogram of ``radical reform'' on Wednesday with only 12 of its 296members opposed.   President Ion Iliescu approved the program Tuesday.   In a televised Fourth of July address, U.S. Ambassador AlanGreen, Jr. warned the Romanian government that ``expressions ofadherence to democratic ideas are not enough.''   ``Democracy is not established by rhetoric or good intentionsalone. These must be accompanied by concrete steps to secure theconrnerstones of freedom ... A democratic government ... encouragespeaceful dissent, it guarantees freedom of expression.''   Washington has criticized last month's government action insuppressing a 53-day opposition rally in central Bucharest,especially the use of miners from outside Bucharest to track downand beat opposition students and intellectuals.</TEXT></DOC>
