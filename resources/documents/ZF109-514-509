(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Operational image systems: A new opportunityandM;Information is the lifeblood of the modern business enterprise.andP;  Whether thebusiness is engaged in manufacturing, sales, or service, paper is by far themost prevalent medium for business communications and information retention.andO;Despite the technology advances that have provided us with powerfulworkstations, high-speed communications, and ever-increasingly denseelectronic data storage, it is still predominantly printed forms that areused to place orders, pay bills, dispatch shipments, initiate actions,document agreements, close deals, and record many other transactions.andP;  Thealphanumeric information extracted from paper documents and entered intocomputer systems (usually by operators using keyboards) is known as codeddata.andP;  The coded data can be manipulated and processed by the computer.andO;Typically, only 1 percent of a corporation's data are coded and available fordata processing.andP;  [1]  The remaining 99 percent of the data are noncoded inthe form of paper, microfiche, or other media.andM;Information is a critical resource, but reliance on paper for it is a bane tomodern businesses.andP;  Processing delays, lost documents, misrouted forms,retrieval delays, and storage requirements are problems that persist todaywith even more serious impact than in the precomputer age.andP;  Moderntransaction processing systems require prompt input of data that must betranscribed from the hard copy to electronic form if the systems are toperform at peak efficiency; every minute of delay between receiving paper andentering its data into the transaction processing system has an impact onproductivity.andP;  The IBM operational image system, ImagePlus[TM], providessolutions for these paper problems.andM;The ImagePlus system augments transaction processing by moving paper from thedesktop to the workstation display.andP;  When paper first enters the business,its information is captured as an electronic image.andP;  From that point it isdistributed, tracked, and processed electronically by the ImagePlus sytem inclose coordination with the transaction processing system.andP;  This integrationof image and transaction processing can yield significant benefits inproductivity, customer service, cost effectiveness, business process quality,and competitiveness.andM;Why image now?andM;Image processing applications have been available for over 20 years.andO;However, the technology necessary for practical image systems was tooexpensive to justify production in a widespread commercial environment suchas a bank or an insurance company.andP;  Several key technology breakthroughs havealtered this situation dramatically in the last few years.andP;  For example, theprice of image-capable workstations has been reduced from the $750 000 rangeof the 1960s, to the $250 000 range of the 1970s, to less than $10 000 in1990.andP;  In addition, the speed of data transmission through networks (bothtelephone and local area networks) has increased as the cost has decreased,to allow the cost-effective transmission of 50 000-character image records.andM;The most significant technology breakthrough, however, has been the advent ofwritable optical disk storage.andP;  Microfilm and microfiche providecost-effective storage but the access is cumbersome, usability is poor, imagequality is uneven, and images are not in a form suitable for computerprocessing.andP;  Today, magnetic DASD is a prohibitively expensive alternativefor an insurance company wiht several million policies on file, or a bankwith several million checks to capture.andP;  Optical storage provides acost-effective replacement of warehouses filled with paper.andM;Businesses justify the cost of image applications in several different ways.andO;Some use floor space savings as their paper-filled warehouses are replacedwith optical disks.andP;  Other use enhanced customer service, which is obtainedby displaying an image on a screen in a matter of seconds as opposed tospending minutes, hours, or even days to find a particular piece of paper ina warehouse.andP;  Still others use the increased productivity of their employees(gains of 20 to 50 percent are typically reported) as the keycost-justification method.andP;  Any or all of these methods are used today tojsutify the installation of an image application.andM;A wide variety of businesses--whether they be small, medium, or lage--arepotential users of image processing.andP;  Every type of business enterprise hashad the experience of being buried under mountains of paper with very littleknowledge of exactly where any specific piece of paper is at any given time.andO;However, some industries are being particularly aggressive in pursuing imagetechnology.andP;  For example, insurance, finance, public sector, andtransportation service companies have immediate needs for applications thatreplace file cabinets.andP;  In other industries, manufacturing companies aredemanding engineering drawing image capability; medical schools and hospitalsare eager to install advanced medical imaging systems to handle X-rays, CAT(computerized axial tomography) scans, or NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance)scans; and scientific users are very interested in full-functionvisualization for their numerically intensive computing applications.andP;  [2] We are just beginning to scratch the surface of the many vital imageapplications that will stimulate new growth in industry in the 1990s andcontinue into the future.andM;Systems solutionsandM;IBM has entered this growth area with solution built from a comprehensivefamily of image products known as ImagePlus.andP;  Successful integration of imagecapability into a customer's business processes requires systems solutions inwhich every key element is designed to accommodate the demands of imageprocessing.andP;  In the ImagePlus system, a true operational image applicationsolution environment was achieved through development of criticalimage-related hardware and software products which, together with existingIBM products, were integrated with transaction processing applications toform an &quot;end-to-end&quot; image solution.andP;  (CICS [Customer Information ControlSystem] and IMS [Information Management System] are examples of thesetransaction processing applications.)andP;  This complex integration task, whichis done in partnership with leding-edge customers on major line-of-businessapplications, differentiates ImagePlus enterprise-wide solutions fromdiscrete products that require customer integration, customization, and userapplication deelopment.andM;All of IBM's key operating system environment offer excellent imageopportunities.andP;  However, the Multiple Virtual Storage/Enterprise SsytemsArchitecture (MVS/ESA[TM]) and Operating System/400[R] (OS/400[R])environments were selected first to prove the technical viability andcustomer justification for image solutions.andP;  Once the solutions are proven,it becomes possible to build solutions for additional environments, such asOperating System/2[TM] (OS/2[R]), VM, and Advanced Interactive Executive[TM](AIX[R]).andP;  These solutions would be developed by leveraging the technologiesand the application experience gained from the initial solutions.andP;  IBM alsooffers the ImagePlus High Performance.andP;  Transaction System (HPTS) for imageenhancement of large check processing centers, and ImagePlus electronicfiling cabinet for storage.andM;The period from mid-1987 to year-end 1989 was spent defining, developing,integrating, testing, and delivering the initial ImagePlus solutions.andP;  Thefirst two applications were insurance policy services and bank credit cardcustomer correspondence.andP;  These applications were initially chosen becausethey represent high-volume paper processes that have good payback and havelong been targeted by businesses for operational improvement via imagetechnology.andP;  These solutions were installed at USAA (see Reference 3) andCitibank (see Reference 4) during 1988 and were made available as products in1989.andP;  During the final development stage, the products were successfullyinstalled as complete systems solutions for a diverse set of operationalimage application environments for nearly 50 IBM customers worldwide.andP;  Theinitial set of image-enhanced applications is nearly as broad as the accountset itself.andP;  However, the applications all share some basic commonrequirements which include folder management, work flow, and case processing.andM;MVS/ESA solution.andP;  The MVS/ESA solution (see Reference 3) provides acomprehensive product set from the optical back end to the image displaymonitor and human interface software at the fron end.andP;  Also included are richhost-based image data management functions, object distribution functions,and folder management and work-flow applications that synchronize the imageapplications with coded-data line-of-business applications.andP;  The design pointof this solution is large enterprise applications that serve thousands ofusers and workstations thta process many thousands of transactions per day,with rapid response time, multigigabyte image document databases, and imagearchives in the terabyte range, and larger.andM;OS/400 solution.andP;  The OS/400 solution (see Reference 4) offers comparablefunction to the MVS/ESA solution, but in a distributed local area network(LAN) configuration.andP;  The same physical optical storage subsystem as theMVS/ESA solution attaches via the IBM 5363 processor on a token-ring LAN.andO;TThis LAN is shared with image workstations (also common to the MVS/ESAsolution), and is attached to an AS/400 application processor.andP;  The AS/400runs the image case processing/work-flow management applications, andprovides the gateway to the associated host-coded data transactionapplications.andP;  The OS/400 image solution has a departmental focus andtopology and a different design point than the MVS/ESA solution.andM;Workstation.andP;  Both previous solutions share a common Personal System/2[R](PS/2[R]) image workstation.andP;  The workstation is designed for highperformance and high resolution image processing and displays, while stillfunctioning as a coded-data transaction terminal for host-based applications.andO;Optical workstation features provide for scanning and image printing support.andO;Special-purpose image accelerator hardware and high resolution landscape andportrait monitors are supported by the image workstation.andM;The above &quot;quick tour&quot; of the solutions illustrates the complexity andbreadth of separate products required to produce an image solution.andP;  Figure 1provides an inventory of the product set required for these two initialsolutions.andP;  Notice that a number of common components in the sorkstation andstorage subsystems are utilized in the two solutions.andM;This wide array of components required the involvement of many IBM sites.andO;Figure 2 shows the locations currently involved in providing these products.andO;Combining products from all these sites with components from several majorvendors and business partners to develop comprehensive image systemssolutions has been an exciting challenge.andM;Image directionsandM;Today's solutions are the first generation of practical solutions with broadapplicability.andP;  Since image applications have finally become affordable andare utilized in the operational environment after more than two decades oftechnical evolution, one could ask, where is image going?andP;  How will imagesolutions evolve?andP;  How rapidly will they impact business processes on a broadscale?andP;  We believe the evolution and impact of image in the 1990s will berapid and dramatic.andP;  Image applications will be in the forefront of strategicinformation system (Is) investments throughout the decade.andP;  The followingsections provide a brief glimpse of possible near-term directions for image,from several different points of view.andM;Technology view.andP;  The key technologies for image growth are workstationpower, communication bandwidth, magnetic DASD, and optical storage.andP;  All ofthese technology areas made rapid advancements in the late 1980s that madeoperational image feasible.andP;  The best news for the future of image is thatall of these areas have very exciting prospects for the 1990s!andM;Workstations.andP;  The evolution of the IBM PS/2 providing increased computepower, memory and storage capacity, display resolution, and software and datamanagement.andP;  There is also increased function and support for peripheralattachments and special-purpose adapters to provide a significant improvementto the overall price uv performance tradeoffs.andP;  Image performance can beenvisioned as becoming comparable to today's high performance coded-dataapplications.andP;  Since all of these facets of the workstation improve the imagestorage and display characteristics directly available to the user, the imageapplication capability of the 1990s workstation will be limited byimagination, not by technology.andM;Communications.andP;  Image networks will benefit and become more widespread inuse because of the improvements in communication technology.andP;  The high volumeof data required will be transmitted via the modem communication facilities.andO;Fiber optic LANS at 100 megabit bandwidth, ISDN (Integrated Systems DigitalNetwork), and fiber backbone network are all designed to deliver largeobjects in high volumes in ever faster and more affordable ways.andM;Magnetic storage.andP;  The significant difference in data retrieval performancebetween magnetic and optical DASD assures that magnetic media will have a keyrole in the image storage hierarchy of the 1990s.andP;  Rapid improvements incapacity and price for magnetic storage, both at the host and theworkstation, are perceived to continue into the foreseeable future.andP;  Thiswill allow for large sets of image documents to be on magnetic DASD, thusallowing high-performance image applications to be unconstrained byrelatively slower optical retrieval times.andM;Optical storage.andP;  today's optical drives and libraries will be viewed inretrospect as the RAMAC[R] era of optical: first generation in performance,capacity, and versatility.andP;  Major advancements in performance and capacityare expected soon and we expect this trend to continue through the 1990s.andO;Read/write optical media are beginning to appear, and the software to exploitthese media in ways akin to magnetic disk storage is in the developmentstate.andM;The fact that all these technologies are developing rapidly makes image oneof the most promising IS industry growth areas of the immediate future.andM;Solution view.andP;  The first two announced platforms address folder-basedapplications for bilevel commercial paper, the image of which is not to bealtered.andP;  Expansion of these solutions to address a range of applications isan obvious next step.andP;  This can be facilitated via a rich assortment ofapplication program interfaces (APIs) and a published image architecture.andO;Taking these solutions into other operating system environments such as OS/2,VM, and AIX represents a broad set of additional opportunities.andP;  Extendingbeyond commercial paper into gray scale, color, large technical images, andanimated computer-generated images for visualization can all be done in anevolutionary way using the basic image tools and data management subsystemsnow being developed.andP;  We fully expect to see image solutions grow in all theabove environments in the early 1990s.andM;Integration view.andP;  To fully address the daily operational needs of the modernknowledge worker, image solutions must become much more fully integrated withother technical tools in the worker's toolkit.andP;  Key items among theseintegration challenges of the immediate future follow.andM;Facsimile, or FAX.andP;  This form of image must be recognizable as both an inputand output medium to operational image systems.andP;  FAX is now a ubiquitousmeans of image communications worldwide and must be fully accommodated toprovide an effective integrated solution.andM;Voice.andP;  In key industries such as insurance and financial services, voicerecords must be stored and retrieved the same as image objects in order tosupport transactions and maintain complete information archives.andM;Office applications.andP;  Full integration of image with professional officeapplications is a strong requirement, both in operational image applicationsand in more casual &quot;electronic file cabinet&quot; environments.andM;OCR.andP;  Optical character recognition (OCR) is a natural extension ofoperational image systems.andP;  The recognition of specific fields on a documentis required to index a document.andP;  converting to coded data with high accuracyfrom many fields on a form will allow elimination of much expensive key dataentry, providing significant new justification for image systems.andM;Technical applications.andP;  A broad set of applications require large drawings,color images, or complex gray-scale images to be contained in the same folderas bilevel images and to be displayed on the same workstations.andP;  Medicalpatient folders containing X-rays, pharmacy records, and admission sheets arean example of such an application; engineering release folders holding E-sizeblueprints together with specification sheets and assembly process sheets areanother.andM;Volume printing.andP;  Printing images in high volume must be achieved on allpoints addressable (APA) printers to meet demands of many applications.andO;Image printing must be intermixed with coded data printing with minimaldegradation of print speed.andM;Enterprise view.andP;  Several early customers of ImagePlus have identified avision of the &quot;image-enhanced enterprise,&quot; in which all key line-of-businessapplications are enhanced by the use of image technology.andP;  Key to that visionis the ability of image systems to exchange information using a commonarchitecture (see Reference 5).andP;  To a bank or insurance company, this wouldbe a critical step in consolidating their customer services and providingon-line access to all coded and image customer data through a common system.andO;The cost savings and competitive and advantage of this level of integrationare significant in several major industries.andP;  Figure 3 is a representativeconfiguration for an insurance company.andP;  This system may easily be modifiedto support other industries and applications.andM;In manufacturing firms, integration of image with engineering graphics andcoded data systems also has excellent justification.andP;  Image-based electronicdata interchange is viable in a manufacturing enterprise, which includescommunications with vendors, customers, and product servicers.andM;Knowledge worker view.andP;  Lastly, competing for the desktop of the knowledgeworker of the 1990s will require providing a rich menu of high-performancetools, utilizing visual and voice image services.andP;  The emerging majorrequirements will include image manipulation, rich work-flow applications,rapid retrieval mechanisms, and strong aids to search folders and files.andO;Advances in human factors will evolve as new applications are used in theworkstation.andP;  Automatic delivery of all necessary information to theknowledge-worker's desktop will be the key to tomorrow's solutions (Figure4).andM;ChallengesandM;ImagePlus provides image solutions for today's operational paper problems.andO;But there are numerous challenges to be addressed in the future as image isimplemented across the workplace and more sophisticated and esotericapplications are developed.andP;  Some areas presenting challenges follow.andM;Human factors.andP;  Working with image documents is different from working withthe paper originals.andP;  Improvements are needed in support of large imagedocuments to enable quick browsing and to locate areas of interest.andO;Enhancement techniques are necessary to clarify images of smudged, damaged,or otherwise illegible documents.andP;  Support is required for viewing andcomparing multiple pages and annotating images with text, image, or audio.andM;Performance.andP;  The performance of today's ImagePlus systems with an imageretrieval time of 5 to 30 seconds is favorably contrasted to paper retrievaltimes measured in hours or days.andP;  However, coded transactions are frequentlycharacterized by subsecond response times, and users will want the imagesystem to perform similarly so as not to unduly impact productivity.andP;  Therequirement for performance improvement must be reflected in all the elementsof the systems--storage, applications, communications, and workstations--ifthe end user is to benefit.andM;Availability.andP;  Images must be available to all enterprise personnel, not justthe primary users.andP;  Whereas coded data exist in many forms and can usually beexchange between users by processing the data through the appropriatetransforms, image is a data type that is supported by few of the existingworkstations and printers.andP;  Affordable upgrades or replacement equipment mustbe developed to enable universal image support.andM;Advanced functions.andP;  Beyond bilevel image is gray-scale and color imaging.andO;Advances in memory, monitors, scanners, storage, communications, andcompression and enhancement techniques are necessary to make the price ofthese systems competitive with today's bilevel systems.andM;Advanced applications.andP;  Sophisticated imaging systems are used today inadvanced application areas such as medicine, engineering, geology,meteorology, visualization, criminal investigation, and machine vision.andP;  Butthere are many applications yet to be addressed, such as recognition ofhandwriting, placing libraries and museums on line, and facial recognition.andM;Cited referencesandM;[1] Information and Information Management: The State of the Industry, theAssociation for Information and Image Management (1989).andM;[2] IBM Systems Journal 27, No.andP;
