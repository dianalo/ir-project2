In control-cell sonicates, 2 x10/sup 2/ and 9 x 10/sup 3/ cell equivalents were required to eitherrelax (total topo) or catenate (topo II) 50% of supercoiled pBR322 DNA.As much as 85% of the total topo activity was lost during the isolationof HeLa cell nuclei, while only 20% of the total topo II (DNA catenation)activity was lost. Thus topo II, which constitutes about 2 to 3% of thetotal cell topo activity, is tightly bound within the cell nucleus. Thus,exposure to ionizing radiation does not inactivate topoisomerase enzymes.Exposure to 500 {mu}g/ml of novobiocin reduced topo II activity in cellsonicates by 50% and also inhibited the recovery of DNA supercoiling(as assayed by nucleoid sedimentation) in irradiated cells by 50%. Asimilar treatment had no detectable effect on: 1) the induction of DNAssb or dsb, 2) the rate, or extent, of repair of DNA ssb or dsb, 3) the&quot;acute&quot; radiation cytotoxicity dose response of HeLa cells or 4) therate, or extent, of recovery from sublethal cell damage. These resultssuggest that topoisomerase enzymes are not critical enzymes in cellularor molecular responses to ionizing radiation.</TEXT></DOC>
