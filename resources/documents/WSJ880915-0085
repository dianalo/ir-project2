Install a hollow warhead with tiny vents that blow open as the missile nears its target. Then pour in a compound that any competent lab can mix up from off-the-shelf ingredients: nerve gas.    The result is a deadly weapon that worried defense experts call the poor man's atom bomb. Low in technology and relatively cheap, chemical weapons are rapidly spreading among the often hostile and unstable nations of the Third World. They aren't merely serving as a brutal threat: They are being used.    In the eight-year war that they are now negotiating to end, both Iran and Iraq repeatedly released poison gas, United Nations inspectors conclude. Iraq, freed from the Iranian front, has used the weapons to devastate its own population of Kurds, according to Kurdish refugees and the U.S. State Department. (Iran and Iraq both deny using gas but accuse each other of doing so.)    Yesterday, the State Department said Libya is on the verge of full-scale production of chemical weapons, a development it called especially worrisome in view of Col. Moammar Gadhafi's record. Meantime, Libya is trying to buy ballistic missiles with a range of up to 3,000 miles, U.S. officials say.    The developed world, so fearful of nuclear weapons and so focused on halting their proliferation, remains remarkably oblivious to the far faster spread of chemical weapons, which in some ways are just as horrible. For many years after World War II, only the U.S., Russia and France had chemical weapons. Now, according to the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, about 20 nations have or are suspected of having them; other experts say the list includes Israel, Egypt, Syria, North Korea, South Korea and Taiwan. Ten other countries are seriously considering obtaining them, the agency says.    Chemical weapons, and the newer, perhaps even more insidious biological weapons, achieve their results by stealth. Often odorless and invisible, they spread silently on the wind and can linger for days. Some kill by burning the skin and lungs, some by causing convulsions and paralysis, and some simply by putting the victim to sleep. They can be used by free-lance terrorists as well as by armies. And they can bring death down the most innocent pathways, making no distinction between military and civilian.    U.N. investigators report the case of a four-year-old Iranian girl who was safely in her house when a chemical attack by Iraq began. Her mother rushed inside to comfort her, apparently bringing in mustard gas vapors on her clothes. The child inhaled them, her lungs were burned, and she met a lingering, painful death.    After such warfare killed or maimed millions in World War I, public horror brought an international agreement in 1925 to ban it forever. The ban has worked to the extent that developed countries haven't used gas on each other, but some of them have continued to use it in the Third World. Perhaps partly because its use remains confined to the more remote areas or to combat pitting one Third World nation against another, chemical weaponry hasn't stirred any great outcry among Western governments or public opinion.    But the industrial world may be too complacent. The merger of lethal chemicals with simple missiles now leaves even superpowers vulnerable. This threat is beginning to be taken seriously in Washington and other world capitals.    It comes with a painful realization that there may be little, if anything, that can be done to stem the proliferation. &quot;If a country is serious about acquiring chemical weapons, it is hard for another country to eliminate that capability the way Israel knocked out Iraq's atomic bomb program,&quot; says a U.S. government expert on the issue. &quot;These weapons can be made and stored in small sites all over a country, and you can never be sure you got them all.&quot;    All this leads some Western military planners and diplomats to conclude that it is time for new thinking on how to complete Geneva talks to ban not simply use but possession of chemical weapons. Policy makers also are giving new attention to the problem of how to defend against chemical weapons. As a first step, the U.S. is trying to step up condemnation of their use.    But while the State Department this month denounced Iraqi gas attacks on the Kurds, it didn't impose any penalty. The major powers' continuing tilt toward Iraq over Iran, Harvard biochemist Paul Doty contends, has led to &quot;total corruption on the issue. It means there is no longer a political cost.&quot;    As for the ingredients of chemical weapons, U.N. and U.S. investigators say Iran and Iraq have acquired ample quantities from chemical suppliers. Most of the weapons are of World War I vintage -- mustard gas, cyanide -- but the war has stimulated research in some developing nations on more deadly nerve gases and interest in biological weapons, which could be expanded by genetic engineering.    The other factor in the threat is the growing world market for aging missiles, cast off by the superpowers because their range and accuracy aren't sufficient for nuclear warheads. Consider the Scud B missile, introduced by the Russians in the mid-1960s. It can deliver a ton of explosives to within a half mile of a target 170 miles away.    Carrying conventional explosives, as the Scud did for both Iran and Iraq in their &quot;war of the cities,&quot; the missile wasn't very accurate. But with a lighter chemical warhead, its range is extended. And inaccuracy is no longer a problem when the payload is gas, which can spread on the wind and contaminate large areas. According to one Pentagon study, the Scud B is now in the hands of Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Libya, Syria and several other nations.    South Korea, also believed to be experimenting with chemical weapons, has modified the outdated U.S. Nike Hercules surface-to-air missile into a longer-range, surface-to-surface weapon. Argentina, China and Brazil are aggressively marketing new missiles, promising double and triple Scud's range, with better accuracy. Among the most interested customers are Iraq, Syria, Libya and Egypt -- all nations considered to have developed sophisticated chemical arsenals.    The proliferation of chemical weapons in the volatile Mideast raises the prospect that any future Arab-Israeli war could be waged with these instruments of mass killing. A number of nations there have updated their crisis planning -- Israel, for instance, having begun large-scale drills to prepare civilians for a gas attack.    America's thinking about how to fight wars in the Third World is changing in the wake of what it has seen in the Iraq-Iran war. According to the U.N., the combatants there have fired poison-gas shells from artillery, dropped them from bombers and delivered them with rocket-firing helicopters.    Thomas J. Welch, a deputy assistant secretary of defense, says that while the U.S. is somewhat prepared for any chemical war with the Russians (who are thought to have the world's largest chemical arsenal), it lacks adequate planning for a Third World crisis where an enemy has poison gas. Despite much talk of Star Wars, the U.S. can't knock down even an obsolete ballistic missile in mid-flight.    Mr. Welch says the Marine Corps, whose missions include the Middle East, is giving much thought to this scenario:   The first hint of the attack is a blip on a radar screen -- a Scud B in flight. Soon the blip arcs down from the stratosphere into the vicinity of a Marine amphibious landing force, the warships still miles from their beachhead. The blip disappears, seemingly harmlessly. But a few thousand feet before it hits the sea, small explosive charges pop open vents in its warhead.    The vents expose the liquid inside to the tremendous force of the air rushing past. The liquid is atomized, forming a mist of lethal droplets that descend in the night. The cloud forms undetected over an oval encompassing three square miles of ocean. Within a few hours several thousand troops are experiencing nausea, impaired vision, then convulsions and finally paralysis. Rescue efforts are extremely difficult because many areas of the tightly packed ships are contaminated. The killing power of nerve gas persists for days.    The U.S., which halted manufacture of chemical weapons in the early 1970s, has no effective defense against such an attack, Mr. Welch says. &quot;Retaliation by nuclear weapons is not credible in this situation. We are faced with the prospect either of defeat and horrible suffering by our people, or being driven to consider weapons we do not want to use.&quot;    The dilemma has inspired some policy changes. One, a couple of years ago, was to resume production of chemical weapons. Now the U.S. is trying to speed development of a nerve-gas bomb, called Bigeye, that could be delivered by carrier-based planes. Such weapons could serve as a deterrent, presenting a potential attacker with the threat of a prompt retaliation in kind.    The Pentagon also is delivering a batch of new protective clothing and other defensive equipment to the Marines. Yet most protective gear is so cumbersome that the mere threat of chemical attack can weaken an enemy, reducing both the morale and the fighting ability of soldiers.    Tough as it is to defend against a chemical attack, trying to stop the weapons from being built seems even harder. Trade in the needed chemicals cuts across boundaries of dozens of industrial nations, and deals are easily concealed. The current shopping spree for poison-gas ingredients is masked, because many are close or identical to compounds used to make pesticides, ink, paints, textiles and plastics, says J.P. Perry Robinson, a chemist at England's University of Sussex. In any case, secrecy is the custom in the highly competitive chemical business.    The frustration of those trying to stop chemical weapons isn't new. The ink was barely dry on the 1925 ban when clandestine use began. That very year, according to Mr. Robinson, Spain dropped surplus World War I chemical bombs on rebels in Morocco. In the 1930s, Japan launched more than 800 gas attacks in its conquest of Manchuria. The same decade, the Italian Army repeatedly gassed Ethiopians.    Then the technology advanced another lethal step. In 1936 a German chemist, Gerhard Schrader, stumbled on a phosphorus compound extremely poisonous to insects. This was good news for his company, which was looking for a better pesticide. But the compound worked almost as well on humans, attacking an enzyme in the nervous system and leading to uncontrollable twitching, paralysis and death. Tabun, as it was later called, was the first nerve gas. And two years later the company developed an even more potent one, known as Sarin.    The Nazis produced 12,000 tons of nerve gas during World War II, but never used it because Hitler was convinced Allied Forces also had nerve gas. He was wrong. But after the war, the Soviet Union, the U.S. and France all built their own arsenals based on the German technology.    Out of sight and out of mind, chemical attacks continued to occur from time to time. Egypt is believed to have used World War II British chemicals against rebels in North Yemen in the 1960s. In the 1970s there were persistent but unsubstantiated reports of Vietnamese use against Hmong tribesmen in Laos (so-called Yellow Rain) and of Iraqi use against the Kurds.    These attacks didn't involve nerve gases, which scientists used as the basis for new pesticides. But other scientists were extending the nerve gases' toxicity to humans, reaching the point where one drop on the skin can kill in minutes. And while nuclear technology is subjected to tough international inspections, nerve-gas technology isn't.    The technology is based on so-called organo-phosphorus compounds. Fifty to 75 plants around the world use them to make pesticides and pharmaceuticals, estimates Leo Zeftel, a Du Pont Co. chemist who is on a team advising U.S. negotiators at the chemical weapons talks in Geneva.    Their recipes are proprietary information, he explains, which companies would fear was endangered if international inspection teams monitored flows of the chemicals. &quot;They could find out who you bought it from, what your processes are and who you sell to. If someone on that inspection team releases that information to a competitor, that company has a problem.&quot;    Will Carpenter, a Monsanto executive who heads the advisory team, says some of the chemicals would be hard to track because they are so pervasive. Hydrogen cyanide, for instance, is a byproduct of plastics-making, and is so plentiful it is sometimes burned as a heat source, Mr. Carpenter says. &quot;Just imagine,&quot; he says. &quot;An inspector calculates you have 10,000 tons of hydrogen cyanide and you can only come up with a tiny part of that amount. He concludes you've built up a chemical-weapons stockpile. And you find that 9,990 tons were burned.&quot;    For such reasons, he predicts, a global chemical weapons ban would be difficult to sell. Politicians would be leery of anything that couldn't be totally verified. Governments and industry would be suspicious of intrusive verification schemes.    &quot;I really think you can wind up with a useful treaty,&quot; Mr. Carpenter says. &quot;If I didn't think so I wouldn't have spent the last nine years on this thing. But I think there is a difference between 100% effective and useful.&quot;    ---   Tim Carrington contributed to this article.    ---                       Spreading Menace                A chemical-weapons gazetteer    Known to have chemical weapons:      France, Iraq, Soviet Union, U.S.    Either have or are developing them:      Egypt, Iran, Israel, Libya, North Korea,      South Korea, Taiwan    Reportedly trying to acquire them:      Afghanistan, Burma, Chile, China, Cuba,      Ethiopia, Pakistan, Thailand, Vietnam    Source: J.P.
