But after his girlfriend, Annie Chervin, admired a particularengagement ring while they were window shopping one spring day in1988, he quietly went back to the shop and bought it withouttelling her.   Fast forward now to a dinner on Feb. 21, 1989. Justin hadsuggested they get dressed up, even though they were eating athome. A $75 bottle of wine signaled a special occasion.   ``The wine was wasted on me,'' recalls Annie, ``because afterJustin said `do you want to get married?' and I said `yes,' hepulled out that ring and gave it to me.''   Their thoughts quickly turned to an outdoor wedding. They couldsee the perfect site by looking out their window. It was theexpansive lawn surrounding the apartment, which occupies part of alandmark colonial house in South Salem, N.Y., a small town about 50miles north of New York City.   Typical of many couples these days, Annie and Justin alreadywere living together, and they planned to arrange and pay for theirwedding themselves. And they wanted a party that wouldn't offendtheir parents' sense of decorum.   As soon as their obliging landlord gave them permission to holdthe ceremony and reception on the grounds, Annie and Justin beganplanning the wedding which would take place a little more than ayear later, on May 19, 1990.   Their first budget estimate was $10,000, and they did manage tokeep costs to under $11,000. Ultimately, most of the cost wascovered by Annie's parents, Alexander and Edith Chernin ofMontreal, as a wedding gift.   As a floral designer and photographic stylist, Annie, now 33,says she knew she had the skills to plan a wedding with 80 guests.``I already had done flowers for weddings and coordinated models,props, logistics and food on many photographic shoots,'' sherecalls. Justin, 31, would lend moral support, help make decisionsand handle many of the technical chores, such as lighting andsound.   They agreed they wanted an informal yet dignified affair atwhich their friends and far-flung families - she is originally fromMontreal and he is English - would get a chance to meet.   ``Having everyone there from all the different aspects of ourlife was important to us,'' says Justin.   ``We started out with the thought of a non-traditional party,but as we got closer to the date, it got more traditional,'' Anniesays.   Taking on many of the tasks herself let her have things just asshe wanted and let her work with friends and acquaintances whoenjoyed creating the party as much as she did herself, she says.   Annie started her planning by making a list of what she thoughtshe would need for the wedding and then went straight to the YellowPages for names. She telephoned first for information about rentalcosts and availability, following up with visits to those vendorsshe considered good possibilities.   When possible, she hired people she already knew. The caterer,Danyell Ray of Greenwich, is a friend, as are the cake baker andphotographer. Otherwise, she relied on instinct, choosing peoplewho she felt were both professional and pleasant.   One of the first important decisions was to find someone tomarry them. Annie is Jewish; Justin's grandfather was a minister,and he grew up in a Church of England family. They wanted areligious service that would be comfortable to both families.   They asked the Rev. Scudder Edwards (not related to the groom),minister of the nearby South Salem Presbyterian Church, to performthe ceremony.   ``He was sensitive to our desire to weave the two religionstogether,'' recalls Justin.   ``He was willing to take out the Holy Ghost but leave God in,''says Annie.``He gave us a standard ceremony book to look at andtold us to put a bracket around any words that made usuncomfortable.''   This important matter settled, they moved on to select caterer,menu, photographer, and music. They found rental sources for alarge tent with a dance floor, tables and chairs, dishes, glassesand silver, tablecloths and portable toilet facilities.   They also had to find restaurant locations for pre-weddingevents and lodgings for the many out-of-town guests, including herfamily and friends from Canada and some of his relatives fromBritain (his parents, Michael and Shiela Edwards, live nearby inCoventry, Conn). Clothing for the wedding party had to be selected.   Annie created her own invitations, and with the help of a friendwho is a florist, chose and arranged the wedding flowers. She andJustin taped the music for the wedding procession and recession.And they chose a festive menu of interesting but healthful food.   Brides often talk of being nervous as their wedding dayapproaches, but for Annie and Justin, the hours rushed by as theymade their preparations.   ``I didn't have time to be nervous,'' says Annie, who was up at6:30 a.m. to start on flower arrangements. Besides the bouquet,which florist Karen McGowan created with flowers Annie had chosen,there were table decoratons for the tent and flowers and greens toadorn the lawn where the service would be held.   Justin was up by 7 a.m. and was soon at work on the sound systemand the temporary outdoor lighting he was rigging up with some helpfrom Michael Orcutt, one of his ushers. Annie's brother and sistersset the tables, working from the model she set up for them.   The day of an outdoor party is usually a worrisome time. Willthe weather cooperate? The morning of May 19 dawned chilly. Thewinds were strong enough to occasion anxious glances skyward as theday progressed.   But there were few mishaps. One was minor damage to his truckwhen Justin backed it out of the driveway into the path of anoncoming car. The people in the other car were mollified when theylearned it was his wedding day.   By 4:30 p.m., the wind had died down, the tables were set, theflowers arranged, and there was just enough time for the couple toduck into the house and change from jeans to wedding clothes. Eachdressed in a different area, since they observed the traditionalprohibition against the groom seeing the bridal gown before theceremony.   Annie recalls it took her a half hour to shower, do her hair,put on her makeup and put on her dress, an ethereal creation insilk and lace.   A few minutes past 5 p.m., the wedding procession began. Withtheir attendants, Justin and Annie strolled down a grassy pathunder a grapevine trellis. And they were married in front of familyand friends, just as they'd planned.   Then, after hors d'oeuvre on the terrace (minipizzas,tofu-sesame meatballs, skewered swordfish and smoked salmon), theguests moved into the heated tent to dance and dine on grilledsalmon, chicken, wild rice, salad, French cheeses and fruit and thetraditional English wedding cake of white iced fruitcake, servedbuffet style.   While everyone was still dancing, and white candles in glassholders glittered like fireflies on the lawn, Annie and Justinstole away to a quiet inn in Connecticut, certain that theirwedding was a fitting finale to their year of planning.</TEXT></DOC>
