Choi seems the model of middle-class propriety until she begins voicing her support for South Korea's student demonstrators.    &quot;Who else is going to be brave enough to face the government?&quot; asks the 45-year-old university graduate and mother of three teen-agers. &quot;I used to think the students were unduly influenced by North Korea. I was afraid they would be used by terrorists. But gradually, my friends and I have come to think the students are speaking their own minds. And what they are doing is really needed.&quot;    The growing disillusionment of the middle class is one of the most important factors in the developing South Korean crisis. The government faces its gravest political challenge since Chun Doo Hwan came to power eight years ago, and now it finds opposition to President Chun's rule is growing beyond its traditional base on campuses, in the militant clergy and in the political opposition movement.    Should a government package aimed at conciliating the opposition be accepted this week, the crisis will subside, at least temporarily. But if the opposition rejects the offer as too little, more demonstrations are likely, and these could trigger a government crackdown.    Active opposition is spreading among ordinarily cautious lawyers, among businessmen, middle-aged matrons and traditionally conservative Buddhist monks. They are people who perhaps never really respected the authoritarian Chun regime, but in the past few weeks they have turned more disenchanted and more vocal.    Their unhappiness stems in part from the fact that on April 13, Mr. Chun summarily broke off debate over a proposed revision of the Korean constitution that opponents had hoped would provide for direct presidential elections. The unhappiness has deepened as Mr. Chun has been unwilling to reverse himself, even in the face of massive protest marches and escalating violence.    In the streets of Seoul and in other South Korean cities, riot police have clashed with thousands of radical students and workers every night for almost two weeks. There have been few serious injuries so far, but police have made more than 4,000 arrests, while demonstrators have stoned police and burned police stations and police equipment. The riot police have dispersed the angry crowds with heavy use of powerful tear gas.    After riot police broke up a sit-in by monks Saturday afternoon, Won Myung vented his anger and frustration. &quot;Normally, monks are so gentle. They never do anything against the government,&quot; said the middle-aged monk, clad in gray robes and with a shaved head. &quot;But when the Buddhist is gentle, the government ignores us. I'm really upset about that.&quot; As for the firing of tear gas into temples and the arrests and beatings of protesting monks, he says, &quot;We are all so angry about that.&quot;    To be sure, the vast majority of Korean people want peace and stability. But conversations with engineers and shopkeepers, physicians, entrepreneurs and cab drivers over the past five days leave an unmistakable impression of a Korean middle class that is unwilling to forego democratization for the sake of prosperity or for mere stability at any price.    &quot;If you compare the economic growth in the society with the political growth, there is really no political growth,&quot; says Y.K. Choi, a well-off 45-year-old export-company executive. &quot;For these eight years of Chun, they have accumulated enough wrongdoing. And the April 13 announcement {postponing debate on the amendment of the constitution until after the Seoul Olympics in 1988} is being done only to prolong their power.&quot;    It would be difficult to imagine less likely closet firebrands than Mr. Choi and his wife, the supporter of student demonstrators. Although he demonstrated briefly during the 1960 student uprising that brought down the government of the late Syngman Rhee, Mr. Choi has lived quietly and conservatively with his wife and raised three children.    In the 1960s, he joined an international company whose good fortunes paralleled those of the Korean export economy overall. He dabbled successfully in land. He bought an apartment in a booming section of Seoul for just over $15,000. The apartment is worth $128,000 today. Although the exterior of the apartment house is an ugly slab of concrete, the Choi apartment itself would be considered comfortable anywhere in the U.S., with Oriental carpets, an expensive stereo, Korean chests, a separate dining room and three bedrooms.    Like other well-off Koreans, Mr. Choi and his family have a strong stake in social stability. But their affluence hasn't inhibited their growing sense of discontent.    &quot;We hear that 70% of us Koreans are middle class, but in a way it makes me laugh, when you stand your situation up against those in power,&quot; says Mr. Choi. &quot;If you want to make good business contracts, you have to have good political connections, or good military connections. And when there are bribery cases brought to light, the sum is huge, like 10 billion won,&quot; or $12.5 million.    Beyond that, Mr. Choi says that somehow the present government &quot;has a lack of political technique. Government doesn't know how to satisfy the people.&quot;    His wife, sitting on the opposite side of the coffee table, continues the conversation.    She grew up in a poor family, and remembers sometimes being hungry as a child. She says it probably makes her sympathetic to the growing gap between rich and poor in South Korea. And the government sometimes seems blind to the unequal distribution, she believes.    Until a few years ago, she says, poorer university students made pocket money by tutoring, but in recent years, the government has frowned upon school children taking after-school classes. Thus, university students, especially those from farming and rural backgrounds, have been deprived of a source of income.    Mrs. Choi sees a possible connection to rising student radicalism, although she admits that Korean radicalism is a confounding mix of Marxism and ultranationalism, at once anti-American and anti-authority.    &quot;The students from the countryside are more activist,&quot; she says. &quot;Many at Seoul National University {the top school} are there on merit. They are sons of farmers, from rural families. Part of their anger is seeing the rich kids drive by in their cars with their girlfriends.&quot;    At least some working-class Koreans believe an apocalyptic event of some kind is in the making. &quot;My boss is a member of the ruling party, and he is worried,&quot; says Chung Young Il, a 41-year-old taxi driver. &quot;We had a meeting with him Friday night, and he said something big is happening.&quot; Mr. Chung and his co-workers believe that Mr. Roh will soon meet with opposition leaders, but he believes the student protests will continue, and eventually the government will crack down. &quot;The military will come in,&quot; says Mr. Chung.    The taxi driver says he sympathizes with the students &quot;something like 80%,&quot; even though the street violence of the past two weeks has cost him financially.    &quot;Because of the protests, I couldn't make my quota,&quot; he says, which amounts to about $90 in fares per day. &quot;I barely made half. It was very damaging. I had to make up the difference.&quot; Mr. Chung earns about $600 per month.    Mr. Chung says he was unable to get downtown because rioting made access to the center of Seoul impossible during certain nightime rush hours last week.    Despite the growing activism of many in the middle class, the economic prosperity of South Korea in the 1980s does serve as a stabilizer. &quot;If you express yourself politically, you hurt yourself economically,&quot; says a Seoul physician who wants to be known only as Dr. Park. &quot;The situation in South Korea is very different from that of the Philippines.&quot;    Dr. Park says that in South Korea, &quot;The majority stay silent. They don't want to show whether they agree or disagree. Each individual has to have some guts.&quot;    Dr. Park says that the price of being a dissident in South Korea can be high. &quot;Professors in universities can be banned from overseas travel, denied promotion or fired. In business and the professions, people suffer, too. Just use your imagination.&quot; One Korean small-business owner in Seoul says the normal price of activism for a successful person is an aggressive tax audit.    Some South Koreans are convinced that foreign media focus on conflict too heavily. &quot;You report too much. You exaggerate,&quot; says Won Myung, the Buddhist monk in Seoul. &quot;The situation isn't as bad as the 1960s or 1970s.&quot;    One man who remembers those days sees both similarities and differences. Mr. Lee, a 70-year-old civil engineer who declines to give his first name, says:    &quot;This situation is the biggest since 1960, I would say, and one similarity is that Syngman Rhee had to step down because of demonstrations. It really started when one student was killed by police in a demonstration, in Masan,&quot; says Mr. Lee.    &quot;But the difference is, back in 1960, there was more support for the demonstrations by all the people. Everybody felt close to the students. This time, the range and scale of support is different,&quot; he says. The prosperity of present-day Korea has certainly diminished the chance for a united opposition. &quot;These high-class people are against demonstration,&quot; he says.    But Mr. Lee also says that sentiment is turning. &quot;People want more democracy.&quot;    And he believes that the aloof, unsmiling Mr. Chun is a far different character from the equally strong ruler the Korean people deposed in 1960. &quot;Syngman Rhee really loved the nation, and he really loved people. When he stepped down, he truly did. When he knew what the people wanted, he actually did it. And when he stepped down, he walked the long way from the Blue House to his villa. He didn't take a limousine. He walked.&quot;    ---   Looking at South Korea Population               41.6 million GNP per capita  1986                    $2,395  1987*                   $2,782 Real GNP Growth  1985                    5%  1986                    12.3% Trade surplus with U.S.  1986                    $7.6 billion U.S. troops              40,000 South Korean troops      600,000 National police force    120,000   *Projection by State Department </TEXT></DOC>
