The national Centers for Disease Control said significant geographic differences are apparent in the death rate from ischemic, or blocked-artery, heart disease -- most commonly heart attacks.    &quot;We're talking about thousands of deaths difference between the low states and the high states,&quot; said Dr. Patrick L. Remington, a CDC researcher.    For example, he said, the nation's worst rate is in New York, where, in 1985, 320 out of every 100,000 men died of ischemic heart disease. The national average was 249; in New Mexico, the rate was 151 per 100,000.    &quot;That translates to thousands of excess deaths in New York, if you compare them to New Mexico,&quot; Mr. Remington said. &quot;Even a 10% difference for this, the leading cause of death in the U.S., is substantial.&quot; The CDC said that 540,800 Americans died of ischemic heart disease in 1985.    The five worst states for men -- New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Michigan and Ohio -- all are in the Northeast or Midwest, where other states with the highest rates were clustered, the CDC reported.    The lowest rates were clustered near Chesapeake Bay and in the West. The areas with the five lowest heart disease death rates for men were the District of Columbia, Hawaii, New Mexico, Maryland and Utah.    For the most part, states with high heart disease death rates for men showed similar rates among women. The highest rates for women were, in order, in New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois and Rhode Island, with the lowest rates in Washington, D.C., Hawaii, New Mexico, Alaska and Utah.    A likely cause of the state-by-state discrepancies, Mr. Remington said, is the prevalence of cigarette smoking.    &quot;These (Northeast and Midwest) states are the states that have high rates of cigarette smoking,&quot; he said. &quot;And we do know that cigarette smoking is the most important preventable cause of heart disease. Most deaths from smoking are heart attacks -- not lung cancer.&quot;    In contrast, &quot;the lowest rates of smoking are in the West,&quot; he said.    Other possible factors include cholesterol levels and differences in medical care, for which no firm state-by-state data are available, Mr. Remington said.    Sociodemographic differences and population shifts also might play a part, the Atlanta-based CDC said in its weekly report.    Heart disease death rates for all ages and geographic areas have decreased in the last two decades, the CDC said, citing previously reported research.    Mr. Remington noted that much of the nation had similarly high heart disease death rates in the 1950s, &quot;then California and the Western states began declining. There's something about it . . . in certain states, it started earlier.&quot;    Heart disease is the leading killer in the U.S., taking more lives each year than all other causes combined, according to the American Heart Association. </TEXT></DOC>
