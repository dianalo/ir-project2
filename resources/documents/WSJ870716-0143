Col. Oliver North's six-day virtuoso performance. The man could play any part in the repertoire, with the possible exception of Quasimodo, and do equally well.    The problem, however, is that the colonel's testimony, stripped of peroration and hyperbole, boils down to an itemized rebuttal of the sworn and unsworn recollections of virtually the entire national security hierarchy. If the colonel is telling the truth, an extraordinary range of other public officials has been lying.    Even as Rear Adm. John Poindexter endures his moment in the spotlight, adding his sincerity to the general stew, the point-by-point contradictions between the claims of Col. North and his former boss, Robert McFarlane, loom in the background like Banquo's ghost. Those points of contention illustrate the larger problems facing the president and his men.    Mr. McFarlane and Col. North disagree on whether Mr. McFarlane ordered Col. North to alter documents. They also disagree on whether the Boland amendment applied to the National Security Council. The one-time NSC chief says that, contrary to Col. North's words, he was not kept informed of all of his aide's activities. Mr. McFarlane says he did not give prior approval to the use of retired Gen. Richard Secord in establishing a covert arms network for the Contras. And, finally, he does not recall any plan to make Col. North the fall guy if the secret operations were disclosed.    Some of this is petty and some of it is significant. Whatever it is, it is only the tip of an iceberg of clashing recollections and downright lies.    All the witnesses appear to have gone to school with the greatest star of them all, the president of the United States. His has been the model in more ways than one right from the start. It was President Reagan, after all, who said:    &quot;We did not -- repeat, did not -- trade weapons or anything else for hostages, nor will we.&quot;    Speculation about secret arms dealings with Iran &quot;has no foundation.&quot;    &quot;We . . . have had nothing to do with other countries or their shipment of arms or doing what they're doing.&quot;    &quot;Yes,&quot; the secretaries of state and defense supported the Iranian arms sale. &quot;We have all been working together.&quot;    One of the whoppers was retracted within an hour, one within a week and one after four months. All the retractions were grudging concessions to truth, wrung from the old trouper by facts that could not be shoved aside. And each admission was offered up with that air of frank, open-faced sincerity that has been the president's stock-in-trade for all of his public life.    On the basis of these two weeks in July, Oliver North is arguably the president's logical successor as public thespian, though not, let us pray, as president. But there are many other aspirants, almost all of whom will have been heard from before the congressional hearings are over. William Casey, the late head of the CIA, no longer qualifies. But as with all the rest, Col. North's words are damning. The colonel claims that his mentor was in on the diversion of the Iranian arms sales profits from the beginning. Mr. Casey, on the other hand, sincerely denied knowing anything of the matter until November 1986.    Then there are the other worthies. Col. North testified that Secretary of State George Shultz &quot;knew in sufficiently eloquent terms what I had done.&quot; Not so, said the secretary's spokesman. Mr. Shultz was not &quot;indicating either his knowledge or approval&quot; of the colonel's Contra-aid activities. Col. North said he assumed Attorney General Edwin Meese had to know of the arms shipments to Iran as early as 1985. Mr. Meese insists he knew nothing until last November too. Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams &quot;knew&quot; that the supply plane shot down in Nicaragua with an American on board was connected to the U.S. government, Col. North says. Absolutely not, says Mr. Abrams. Col. North had told him he &quot;was not violating the law.&quot;    Most of these men sound and look sincere. Certainly each one sees himself as honorable, and perhaps so are they all, all honorable men. But the public is no longer so sure. The polls say the people believe Col. North but not the president. They believe Col. North, but also believe his superiors are using him as a scapegoat.    The reason the president and the others are no longer believable is that even the best, the most sincere of performances cannot indefinitely sustain a script riddled with lies. From the first shipment of arms to Iran, American policy has been riddled with lies -- lies to allies, lies to Congress, lies to the American people, as committee co-chairman Lee Hamilton put it on Tuesday. Stellar performances notwithstanding, integrity, truth and commitment to a government of checks and balances are absolutely required or the only play that really matters will inevitably go off the boards.    ---   Mr. Carter is a political commentator who heads a television production firm. </TEXT></DOC>
