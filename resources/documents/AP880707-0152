The official Islamic Republic News Agency agency, monitored inNicosia, said the Foreign Ministry dismissed claims by Shultz thatIranian officials had sent messages through third partiesindicating a desire to open diplomatic discussions with the UnitedStates.   The unidentifed Foreign Ministry spokesman described Shultz'sclaim as ``futile efforts'' to divert world public attention fromSunday's downing of an Iranian passenger airliner by a U.S. missilecruiser in the Persian Gulf. All 290 people aboard the jetlinerwere killed.   The New York Times published a report Wednesday quoting Shultzas saying, ``we've had a number of probes ... from Iran throughvarious third parties saying that they'd like to talk with us, andwe've responded to those.''   The newspaper said Shultz declined to identify the Iranianofficials involved and that he would not speculate on what effectthe airliner attack might have on the previous proposal.   The Iranian spokesman said Shultz's report also aimed at coolingdown the fury of the Iranian people over the U.S. ``crime andlegitimizing its illegal military presence in the gulf.''</TEXT></DOC>
