Pascal Zachary   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>06/29/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B4</SO><CO>   WNEWS AAPL LOTS</CO><IN>COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR)SOFTWARE (SOF)</IN><LP>   Apple Computer Inc. decided to fold its Claris softwareunit -- which has spent most of this year laying plans for aninitial public offering -- back into the company.   The move is a major switch for Apple, which formed Claristhree years ago to take over much of its personal-computersoftware business. At the time, John Sculley, Apple's chiefexecutive officer, explained that Apple needed to distanceitself from the business of selling software applications soas not to anger independent companies in that business. Eversince, Mr. Sculley has cited Claris as an example of what hedescribes as a &quot;federation&quot; of companies all supporting theApple &quot;mothership.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   According to industry executives familiar with thesituation, Apple changed its mind because it believes itneeds more control over software applications for itscomputers at a time when some of the most creativeindependent software companies are beginning to spend moreresources on producing applications for competitors'computers.   Spokesmen for both Apple and Claris declined to comment,but industry executives said Apple was ready to announce themove as early as today.   &quot;It's a very sensible decision in my opinion,&quot; saidCharles Wolf, an analyst at First Boston Corp. &quot;The entirepremise for setting up Claris no longer holds.&quot;   Mr. Wolf said that unlike several years ago, when Apple'sflagship Macintosh computer had an insufficient amount ofsoftware, there is plenty available for the machine today.Apple now faces a situation where the outside firms thatwrite software for the Macintosh have been so successful thatthey have begun writing software for machines based onarch-rival International Business Machines Corp.'s personalcomputers.   Indeed, even executives at Claris conceded that once thefirm was independent from Apple, which was scheduled tohappen later this year, it too would begin writing softwarefor personal computers made by Apple competitors. WhileClaris has posted yearly revenue about $100 million fromselling software from Apple computers, investment bankers,handling the subsidiary's stock offering, insisted thatClaris broaden its business to flourish outside of Apple'sumbrella.   According to people familiar with the situation, MichaelSpindler, who was named Apple's chief operating officer inJanuary, would not brook such a situation. He is said tobelieve that Apple must have some internal capacity toproduce applications software that takes advantage of whatthe company considers the unique features of its Macintoshcomputers.   Bringing Claris, which is the second biggest supplier ofApple software after Microsoft Corp., back into Apple couldupset some independent software developers who are wary aboutcompeting directly with Apple in software applications. Butthe benefits of an internal applications business are worththe criticisms.   &quot;Now Apple has a currency to retain the unique software onthe Macintosh,&quot; Mr. Wolf said.   The flip-flop on the status of Claris is only one of manyorganizational and strategic changes occurring at theCupertino, Calif., computer maker. This week, the companyhired a new president of Apple USA, its biggest sales andmarketing organization and yesterday it announced thedeparture of one of its most senior executives in productdevelopment.   Donald P. Casey, Apple's vice president of networking andengineering, joined Lotus Development Corp., a Boston-basedsoftware company, as its new vice president of thespreadsheet division, in charge of its key revenue source.   Mr. Casey, 44 years old, said that the Lotus job &quot;is agreat opportunity.&quot; He said he wasn't leaving Apple in adispute over strategy, but declined to comment on Apple'soutlook.   Most of the changes are related to decisions made by Mr.Spindler, who ran Apple's fast-growing European operationsbefore coming to headquarters to revive the company'sdomestic marketing and streamline its field organization.   On the product side, meanwhile, Apple also has made anabout-face. In recent years the company has introduced aseries of increasingly expensive computers. While successful,these products have sharply narrowed the market for Apple'smachines, leading analysts to complain that the company is nolonger catering to the mass market.   Mr. Sculley has made it plain that he intends to fix thatand since taking over direct responsibility for Apple'sproduct development in late January has been spending most ofhis time trying to rush into creation two lower-pricedMacintosh machines.   While outsiders question the wisdom of Mr. Sculley'sdirect involvement in product planning -- the Apple chief isa marketing man and has no formal training in engineering --executives inside Apple's product development groups say heis getting results.   &quot;Apple's playing a different game now, and frankly, that'svery refreshing,&quot; said Lawrence Tesler, vice president foradvanced products at Apple. Mr. Tesler approves of Mr.Sculley's emphasis on less-expensive models because hebelieves it will result in a broader following among computerusers.</TEXT></DOC>
