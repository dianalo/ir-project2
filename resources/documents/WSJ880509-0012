Since the middle of April, the franc's value has stayed between 5.6460 and 5.7305 to the U.S. dollar and between 3.3920 and 3.4026 to the mark. Despite a slight weakening the past few weeks, &quot;all in all, it's been very well contained,&quot; Lawrence L. Kreicher, an international economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, New York, said of the French currency.    Last week, Christopher Potts, chief economist at Banque Indosuez, said the French election would be &quot;something of a non-event&quot; for the currency market.    President Francois Mitterrand won reelection by a wide margin yesterday.    Analysts had said the similarities between the broad economic policies of Socialist President Mitterrand and his conservative rival, Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, suggested that the election results wouldn't produce any major upheavals. &quot;We're not going to see any radical changes,&quot; Mr. Kreicher said.    Foreign exchange dealers said the recent calm partly reflected statements by both candidates that they wouldn't use what has been a common post-election tactic in France: seeking a devaluation of the currency within the eight-nation European Monetary System of managed exchange rates.    Devaluation has been an attractive option to newly elected politicians in the past. It gave industry an immediate competitive boost by lowering the prices French exports, and it allowed the new government to blame the move on the &quot;heritage&quot; of the previous administration.    But Messrs. Mitterrand and Chirac both support a strong franc and have said France's main problem in international trade isn't that its exports aren't competitively priced but that many French goods aren't adapted to foreign markets.    Calls from industry for a devaluation of the currency were conspicuously absent during the election campaign. Some analysts suggest this reflects the fact that labor costs in France have been rising more slowly than in its major trading partner, West Germany.    Another frequently cited reason for the franc's steadiness is that French interest rates are at historically high levels, offering a return of about two percentage points more than West German rates, when both are adjusted for inflation. This provides investors with an attractive cushion against a depreciation of the French franc and soothes inflation fears.    &quot;It's hard to believe that the French franc is really going to weaken a lot, because real interest rates are high,&quot; Hubert Pedroli, vice president, foreign exchange, at Credit Suisse in New York, said.    Many analysts agree, however, that a realignment of European Monetary System rates will become necessary by the end of this year. The most likely scenario would be downward pressure on the Italian lira later in the year that would oblige the Italian authorities to seek a realignment.    &quot;If any pressure is going to materialize, it will be on the lira,&quot; Mr. Pedroli said.    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   Conflicting interpretations of news that the U.S. unemployment rate dropped in April neutralized the report's impact on currency markets as the dollar slipped from its Thursday levels.    The Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate fell to 5.4% in April from 5.6% in March. It also said non-farm payrolls increased by 174,000 last month, compared with a revised rise of 296,000 in March.    The dollar initially rose on the news but abruptly turned back downward.    In late New York trading, the U.S. currency stood at 1.6796 marks, compared with 1.6855 late Thursday. The dollar also eased to 124.75 yen from 125.08.    In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at 124.70 yen.    Foreign exchange dealers and economists were ambivalent in their interpretations of the unemployment figures. While they agreed that the U.S. economy continues to grow at a moderate pace, market participants were divided on whether that's good for the dollar.    &quot;The number created some confusion, and the total effect was neutral,&quot; said Marc Goloven, a vice president and economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York.    &quot;This is one more sign that the economy's expansion remains on track at a moderate clip,&quot; Mr. Goloven said.    However, he said, there are two schools of thought in viewing the data. One is that strong employment growth might slow the process of reducing the U.S. trade deficit, with more Americans working and able to buy imported goods, making the trade deficit a continuing drag on the dollar. On the other hand, growth and the higher inflation that many expect to accompany it might prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, which would boost the dollar, Mr. Goloven said.    Michael D. Andrews, vice president and foreign exchange economist at Irving Trust Co., New York, said the employment report &quot;looks like it was neutral in the short run, but unless the economy slows down, ultimately it could be bad for the dollar.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $1.70 an ounce to $443.70 in brisk trading. Estimated volume was four million ounces.    In early Hong Kong trading Monday, gold was quoted at $444.20 an ounce.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Friday, May 6, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
