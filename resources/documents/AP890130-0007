SNIFFEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writers</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A fifth of all senior federal judges includingformer Chief Justice Warren E. Burger stand to collect their largestpay raises in a decade even though they no longer handle any courtcases, The Associated Press has learned.   This windfall _ increasing Burger's salary by $60,000 to $175,000a year, for example _ stems from a complex retirement system thatallows federal judges to reduce their caseloads sharply while stillqualifying for active-duty pay increases. In stepping down fromfull-time duty, they accept a title of ``senior judge.''   Aside from Burger, the 305 other senior judges also stand to seetheir salaries rise by about 50 percent unless Congress disapprovesthe package of raises for top federal officials.   Judges who retire through resignation _ the other option providedby Congress _ keep for life the same salary they received on theirlast day of work. In Burger's case, it would have been $108,400.   Senior status is the vastly more popular option, and expertsbelieve the federal court system might be hopelessly clogged withoutthe part-time contributions of these jurists.   But administrative records obtained by the AP indicate thatroughly one in five of the nation's 306 senior judges do no judicialwork whatsoever. They get the raises but are as hard to find on thebench as the 13 former judges who chose full retirement throughresignation.   ``It doesn't seem fair,'' said Rep. Carlos Moorhead, a member ofa House subcommittee overseeing the federal judiciary. TheCalifornia Republican, whose skepticism last year sidetracked a billto lower the eligibility age for senior status, said, ``We need tolook into this much further.'' Congress may want to study``establishing some minimum work to qualify for the raises,'' hesaid.   As the law stands now, there is no such minimum. A senior judgemay work as much _ or as little _ as he wants. A federal judgecannot be forced to resign; the Constitution says a judicialappointment is for life.   Under recommendations by then-President Reagan, the highest-paidfederal officials will receive their largest raises in a decade onFeb. 8 if Congress does not disapprove.   Comparatively unnoticed in the political controversy over the 50percent congressional pay raise are equal increases for federaltrial judges and raises nearly as generous for the rest of thejudiciary.   Federal district judges would see their salaries rise from$89,500 to $135,000; appellate judges from $95,000 to $140,000; andSupreme Court justices from $110,000 to $165,000. Senior judges getthe same salaries.   Stephen Gillers, professor of legal ethics at New YorkUniversity, said he saw no ethical problem for the non-workingsenior judges but ``it may be the statute should be changed. It maybe unwise or bad management. It's a question whether the public isgetting its money's worth.''   Congress created the senior judge category in 1919. By luringolder jurists out of their lifetime appointments, lawmakers hoped toease court workloads and open jobs for younger appointees to thebench.   In large measure, senior judges pitch in just as Congressintended.   As a group, they handle between 10 and 15 percent of all federalcases. ``The federal judiciary would be a mess without the help ofsenior judges,'' said Frank Coffin, an appeals court judge fromPortland, Maine, who plans to maintain a substantial caseload oncehe claims senior status.   Some, like 91-year-old Elbert P. Tuttle of Atlanta, are on thebench almost as often as their 750 active colleagues. Tuttle doesabout 70 percent as much work as the active judges in the 11th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals, according to circuit executive NormanZoller.   The Associated Press obtained a copy of the only public report onthe subject of senior judge workloads, compiled by theAdministrative Office of the Courts. Identifying each senior judgeonly by a code number, with no names listed, the report showed thatin the year ending June 30, 1987, 56 of 271 senior judges, or 21percent, handled no cases. Forty nine of the 56 were over 75 yearsold.   David Cook, who keeps track of such statistics for the office,said office policy bars him from releasing information on individualjudges by name or more recent coded data. But he said, ``If you didthe survey today, I don't think things would be much different.''   Senior status is available to any judge who is at least 65 with15 years experience or 70 with 10 years. There are now a total of306, including Burger, and Cook said the patterns found in 1987 are``not out of date.''   For those senior judges who do not work, reasons can differdramatically.   James Noel Jr., a senior judge in Houston, performed his lastjudicial duty in 1978 when his annual salary was $54,500 _ $80,500 ayear less than the salary he stands to begin receiving next month.   Noel, 79, took senior status in 1976 when he was 66, after 15years as a federal trial judge. Asked why he chose senior status andnot resignation, Noel told AP, ``It was just a matter of choice.''   Noel regularly travels to his downtown office to manage his``extensive investments.'' When asked about his impending pay raise,Noel said, ``I was expecting it.''   Owen Cox, appointed as a federal trial judge in Texas byPresident Nixon in 1970, took senior status in 1981. Jesse Clark,the district court's clerk, said Cox did substantial work for mostof a year until ``his health failed and he had difficulty getting tothe office.''   ``He's been hospitalized for three years. He's on a life-supportsystem,'' Clark said.   Cox's salary would rise to $135,000 next month. Had he resignedin 1981 his salary would have been frozen at $67,100.   Burger left the Supreme Court bench in September 1986 to serve asunpaid chairman of the commission celebrating the bicentennials ofthe Constitution and Bill of Rights. He declined to answer questionsabout his impending pay increase and his judicial workload otherthan to pass along that, ``I'm too busy to sit.''   When he retired, his salary was $108,400. Had he resigned,Burger's annual salary would have been frozen for life at thatfigure. But Burger, who has spent much of his career campaigning forhigher salaries for judges, chose senior status. As a result, hequalifies for whatever pay raises are extended to his successors aschief justice.   In 1987, the chief justice's salary was raised to $115,000, andBurger got the increase along with Chief Justice William Rehnquist.Under the new proposal, Rehnquist and Burger each would be paid$175,000.   Supreme Court spokeswoman Toni House said Burger has not beenasked to hear any cases because, she presumed, Rehnquist is awarethat Burger works full-time as chairman of the bicentennialcommission.   By contrast, Rehnquist assigned former Supreme Court JusticeLewis Powell to serve on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals inRichmond, Va.. Powell also will sit next month on the 11th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals in Florida.   ``As a lawyer and law teacher I would be troubled if judges werebeing paid for doing nothing and getting increments for doingnothing unless Congress made a conscious decision that even judgesin total retirement should get pay raises,'' Professor Gillers said.   He said nothing in law or judicial standards makes it unethicalfor a senior judge to do no work and collect pay raises.   ``I can't speak to the personal propriety,'' he said. ``Everyjudge has to make that decision for himself.''   Coffin, the federal appeals court judge, said, ``It's a goodtheoretical question'' whether the system is fair. ``If there weremore frequent pay raises for judges I'd be more bothered.''</TEXT></DOC>
