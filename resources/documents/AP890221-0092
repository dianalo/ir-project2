(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Camouflaged combat fatigues replaced pastelnursing uniforms at the state-run General Hospital, where the RhodeIsland National Guard was called in to replace striking workers forthe second time this year.   ``The Guard is prepared to stay there as long as necessary,''said Patrick Kirby, chief of staff for Gov. Edward D. DiPrete, afternurses and attendants at the 480-bed hospital walked out in acontract dispute Monday.   Seven of the 110 Guard troops sent to the hospital had nursingtraining; the rest were given non-medical tasks such as feeding,washing and dressing patients.   ``I think it's a very dangerous situation for patients, in fact Ithink it's life-threatening,'' said Thomas Romeo, director of thestate Department of Mental Health, Retardation and Hospitals. ``Notall the individuals up there right now know exactly what they'redoing. There's not a lot of tolerance for error.''   Citing the possible harm and the illegality of strikes by stateemployees, the state sought a court order to force the employees toreturn to the hospital, which mostly handles long-term patients.   Superior Court Judge Antonio S. Almeida said he would issue aruling today after listening to lawyers from both sides presenttheir arguments.   Joe Fargnoli, president of Local 1350 of the American Federationof State, County and Municipal Employees, said the main issue in thecontract dispute is not money but the hospital's refusal to fillvacant jobs.   ``We only want the state to honor its contract with us and pulltogether with the employees to restore normality and security hereat the hospital,'' he said.   Patient Louise Baran, herself a registered nurse, said she feltcomfortable about the care she was receiving. Although she didn'tfault either side in the dispute, she said she was disappointed ithad reached the point of a walkout.   However, 56-year-old Connie Prior, a quadriplegic who has been atthe hospital for two years, was incensed by the walkout.   ``I think this is totally uncalled for,'' Ms. Prior said.``Number one should be the patients.''   More than a dozen acute-care patients have been transferred toother hospitals since the walkout began, and the facility hasstopped admissions, officials said.   Doctors reported to work as usual Monday, but about one-fifth ofthe 89 attendants and fewer than half the 13 licensed practicalnurses showed up for the first shift, officials said. About half the26 registered nurses honored the picket line, said Dan Caley, aspokesman for the state health agency.   DiPrete called out the National Guard late Sunday after the unionvoted 4-1 to reject a proposed 53-cent-an-hour raise offered inreturn for concessions on staffing.   A previous four-day sickout ended Jan. 31 when the Guard wascalled in.   Under the hospital's latest offer, starting salaries forattendants would go from $16,600 to $17,600, and for nurses wouldincrease from $18,800 to $20,000, he said.   Contract negotiations broke off Friday, and no new talks werescheduled.   The hospital appealed for volunteers to augument the NationalGuard. Dan McCarthy, coordinator of hospital volunteers, said thefacility was seeking about 30 general helpers and 16 nurses. Onlyabout two dozen people volunteered Monday, said a volunteercoordinator who would not give her name.   One striker, a therapist who would not give her name, said shefelt no qualms about the walkout. ``I think it's for a good cause,''she said. ``We have a medical emergency staff (on call) in caseanything should happen. It's not like we're totally abandoningthem.''</TEXT></DOC>
