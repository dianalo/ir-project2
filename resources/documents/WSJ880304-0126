A senior administration official says Gen. Noriega, who has been indicted by two U.S. grand juries on drug charges, is only &quot;the most obvious product but not the cause&quot; of the country's weak civilian leadership, rampant corruption and flourishing money-laundering operations. &quot;Getting rid of him can only be the start, but unless he goes you can't even begin to clean up the rest,&quot; the official says.    The administration is optimistic that the economic warfare being waged by the U.S. and the Panamanian opposition will lead to Gen. Noriega's downfall. But, officials concede, it could still take months. And if Gen. Noriega manages to hold on, some officials worry that he will turn to Cuba and Nicaragua for support, further damaging U.S. interests in the region and possibly jeopardizing the security of the Panama Canal.    The U.S. is supporting lawsuits the Panamanian opposition has filed to freeze Panamanian assets in U.S. banks. The administration will put in escrow its monthly payments of $7 million for use of the Panama Canal and is preparing trade sanctions. These measures are aimed at boosting President Eric Arturo Delvalle, whom the U.S. considers Panama's constitutional leader. Mr. Delvalle went into hiding in Panama following his failed attempt last week to dismiss Gen. Noriega. The Panamanian legislature, which is controlled by Gen. Noriega, fired Mr. Delvalle and named a new president.    Should the U.S. succeed in toppling Gen. Noriega, its victory would be empty if Panama then proved incapable of reducing the power and corruption of the Panamanian Defense Forces and halting the laundering of billions of dollars in drug money. Most of all, the U.S. is acting now in the hope that a strong, democratic government can emerge by the end of 1999, when the U.S. has agreed to place the Panama Canal under Panamanian control.    &quot;The focus is now on getting rid of Noriega, but the problems that brought him will all be there when he's gone,&quot; says Richard Millett, an expert on Panama at Southern Illinois University. &quot;The flood of dirty money distorts politics and corrupts security forces. Noriega didn't create that, and it isn't going to change once he is gone. The money is there, and the people have grown accustomed to taking it.&quot;    After months of sending Gen. Noriega mixed signals, all branches of the administration -- as well as congressional leaders of both parties -- agree that his continued rule endangers vital U.S. interests. But there are differences on tactics.    The State Department continues to promote more immediate and severe anti-Noriega measures than does the Pentagon. Defense officials worry about their 10,000 soldiers in Panama, about intelligence listening posts, and about the security of the Panama Canal. &quot;They don't want to burn all bridges to Gen. Noriega, just in case he hangs on,&quot; says one official.    And the State Department, worried about provoking an anti-American backlash, is trying to moderate some senators' calls for a total trade embargo, hoping to make any actions more narrowly aimed at Gen. Noriega. Officials strongly deny Gen. Noriega's charges that the U.S. moves are designed to retain control of the canal.    In interagency meetings, State Department officials argue that more immediate pressure must be applied now before Gen. Noriega finds alternative sources of capital. They warn the Pentagon that the only countries in the region that have actively backed Gen. Noriega are Cuba and Nicaragua. His continued rule could hence result in a leftist-oriented military regime, State Department officials argue.    In its bid to oust the Panamanian strongman, Washington is trying to sway the only group it believes capable of removing him: his fellow officers. Its efforts are complemented by the opposition's progress in unifying a collection of weak parties around President Delvalle to demonstrate to the military that Gen. Noriega is isolated and should be abandoned.    Yesterday, U.S. district courts issued temporary restraining orders on Panamanian funds held at four U.S. banks: Marine Midland Bank, Bankers Trust Co., Irving Trust Co. and First National Bank of Boston. The courts acted at the request of Juan Sosa, Panama's ambassador to the U.S. and a Delvalle supporter. Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said Mr. Sosa was the &quot;sole person having authority to receive, control or dispose of any property held in any such federal reserve bank or insured bank&quot; on behalf of Panama.    Senior officials say the Panamanian leader hasn't threatened U.S. interests in the country, realizing that American response would be more harsh than it is now. Moreover, Panama Canal workers have proved to be firm supporters of the opposition, and would be unlikely to heed instructions from the general. The opposition has instructed them not to join the general strike in Panama that State Department official say has shut down 75% of the country's businesses.    Though analysts in Panama say Gen. Noriega has the loyalty of the Panamanian Defense Forces, U.S. officials contend there are signs of fissure. &quot;We are seeing evidence that Noriega isn't as sure of his officer corps as he is trying to portray,&quot; says William Walker, deputy assistant secretary of state for Central America.    U.S. officials say the ultimate success of their policy depends on whether they and the opposition can exploit these fissures without putting into power another military officer steeped in corruption and drug trafficking.
