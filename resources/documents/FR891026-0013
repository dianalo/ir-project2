The density of traffic and the type of operations being conducted in theairspace surrounding major terminals increase the probability of midaircollisions. In 1970, an extensive study found that the majority of midaircollisions occurred between a general aviation (GA) aircraft and an aircarrier, military or another GA aircraft. The basic causal factor commonto these conflicts was the mix of uncontrolled aircraft operating undervisual flight rules (VFR) and controlled aircraft operating under instrumentflight rules (IFR). TCA's provide a method to accommodate the increasingnumber of IFR and VFR operations. The regulatory requirements of TCA airspaceafford the greatest protection for the greatest number of people by providingATC with an increased capability to provide aircraft separation service,thereby minimizing the mix of controlled and uncontrolled aircraft. Salt Lake City International Airport qualifies for TCA status by meetingthe criteria published in FAA Handbook 7400.2C, ``Procedures for HandlingAirspace Matters.'' The criteria for establishing a TCA are based on factorswhich include the number of aircraft and people using that airspace, thetraffic density, and the type or nature of operations being conducted.Accordingly, guidelines have been established to identify TCA locationsbased on two elements_the number of enplaned passengers and the numberof aircraft operations.To date, the FAA has established a total of 25 TCA's. The FAA is proposingto take action to modify or implement the application of these proven safetytechniques on more airports so as to provide greater protection of airtraffic in the airspace regions most commonly used by passenger-carryingaircraft. <ITAG tagnum="84">User Group Participation </ITAG>The TCA adopted by this amendment is the product of discussions with abroad representation of the aviation community. In conjunction with thisaction, the FAA will continue to work cooperatively with local user groupsto ensure that the TCA is effective for all users by identifying any adjustmentsor modifications that appear necessary. Through joint FAA and user cooperation,any problems that arise can then be identified and corrective action takenwhen necessary. The TCA configuration adopted in this final rule has been developed throughsubstantial public participation. Initially, informal airspace meetingswere held on October 4, 5, and 6, 1988, to allow local aviation interestsand airspace users an opportunity to present input for the design of theproposed TCA. In addition, a local committee ASPAC was formed comprisinga cross section of the aviation community with technical assistance providedby Salt Lake City ATC personnel. After those initial meetings and furthercoordination with ASPAC representatives, a tentative TCA configurationwas prepared for public discussion. As a result of those efforts, furtheradjustments to the TCA configuration were made and were reflected in theFAA's modified configuration proposed formally for adoption. An additionalopportunity for public participation was provided by a Notice of ProposedRulemaking (NPRM) published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 23, 1989 (54 FR 26680). Four commentswere received in response to the Notice. Due consideration has been givento these comments as well as the comments received at the various meetings.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments </ITAG>The FAA received four comments pertaining to the TCA proposal. All commentswere considered fully before developing the final design contained in thisrule. The FAA believes that the final TCA design best meets ATC and userrequirements and promotes the safe and efficient use of airspace. Wasatch Front Regional Council wrote commending the FAA during this rulemakingprocess for cooperating with their subgroup, ASPAC, and including theirsuggestions in the TCA proposal. The FAA welcomes comments from user groups, and when all FAA safety requirementsare met, incorporates these comments in the final design. The Air Transport Association of America (ATA) wrote concurring with theproposed TCA configuration. The ATA stated that although the TCA designdoes not conform with a ``generic'' design, they believe the current ModeC rule (Transponder with Automatic Altitude Reporting Capability Requirement,53 FR 23356, June 21, 1988) essentially extends the effects of the TCAaircraft equipment requirements to a 30-nautical mile radius of the TCAairport from the surface up to 10,000 feet MSL. The lateral limits of the Salt Lake City TCA are extended to 25 miles tocontain all aircraft operating to and from the primary airport. This extensionallows aircraft to exit through the top of the TCA and operate above thedesignated floors. The Mode C veil substantially increases safety in theairspace surrounding the Salt Lake City TCA. However, because of exemptions(i.e., gliders and balloons) and other authorized exceptions granted individually,ATC will not have knowledge of all aircraft operating in the airspace betweenthe TCA boundaries and the Mode C veil. The Utah Aeronauts Hot Air Balloon Club wrote requesting a Mode C transponderexemption from Salt Lake City Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON)which would allow them to operate above 10,000 feet MSL within 30 nauticalmiles of the Salt Lake City International Airport. The Mode C rule provides exemptions for aircraft which were not originallycertificated with an engine-driven electrical system or which have notsubsequently been certified with such a system installed. Individual authorizationfor balloons to operate within the TCA may be granted on a case-by-casebasis. The Department of the Air Force wrote requesting the FAA to delete a three-mileradius around Hill Air Force Base to accommodate unrestricted trainingfor simulated flame out approaches (SFO). This area is also used by civil aircraft operating to and from the SaltLake City International Airport. The FAA believes that it is necessaryto retain this airspace within the TCA to provide a safer environment forthe mix of military aircraft with civil aircraft. Procedures to accommodateSFO approach training will be specified in a letter of agreement. In the NPRM design, the Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC) Runway16R ILS (I-MOY) localizer/DME (LOC/DME) antenna was used as the referencepoint to describe some of the lateral boundaries of the TCA. Since SLCRunway 16R ILS is interlocked with SLC Runway 34L ILS, simultaneous operationof both ILS's would be precluded. Therefore, the TCA will be describedutilizing the SLC Runway 16L LOC/DME ILS (I-BNT) which operates independently.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Rule </ITAG>This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations designatesa Terminal Control Area (TCA) at the Salt Lake City International Airport,UT. The TCA utilizes the Runway 16L ILS localizer/DME antenna, latitudeand longitude points, NAVAID radials, and landmarks where practical toaccommodate current traffic flows and provide a greater degree of safetyin known areas of congestion involving controlled IFR and uncontrolledVFR flights. Consequently, the FAA has determined that establishment ofa TCA at the Salt Lake City International Airport is in the interest offlight safety and will result in a greater degree of protection for thegreatest number of people during flight in that terminal area. Salt LakeCity lnternational Airport is currently served by an ARSA which is rescindedwith the establishment of this TCA. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation Summary </ITAG>The FAA is required to assess the benefits and costs of each rulemakingaction to ensure that the public is not burdened with rules having costswhich outweigh benefits. This section contains an analysis which quantifies,to the maximum possible extent, the costs and benefits of establishinga TCA at Salt Lake City, UT. This final rule is intended to lower the likelihood of midair collisionsby increasing the capability of the ATC system to separate all aircraftin terminal airspace around the Salt Lake City International Airport. Thisaction was prompted by data indicating that a high percentage of near midaircollisions reported to the FAA in terminal areas involve VFR aircraft thatare not required to be under the control of ATC. Thus, the overall objectiveof this rule is to substantially increase safety while accommodating thelegitimate concerns of airspace users.Costs-Benefits Analysis <ITAG tagnum="81">a. Costs </ITAG>The FAA estimates the total cost expected to accrue from implementationof this rule to be $2.6 million (discounted, 15 years) in 1987 dollars.Approximately $2.5 million (discounted) or 96 percent of the total estimatedcosts will be incurred by the FAA primarily for additional personnel andequipment. The remaining costs will be incurred by small general aviation(GA) aircraft operators who will be required under this rule to equip theiraircraft with Mode C transponders sooner than they would have for the formerSalt Lake City ARSA under the previous FAA rule: ``Transponder With AutomaticAltitude Reporting Capability Requirement (Mode C)'' (53 FR 23356, June21, 1988). This rule will be implemented in two phases. Phase I, whichbegan on July 1, 1989, requires a transponder with Mode C at and above10,000 feet MSL and in the vicinity (30 nautical miles) of TCA primaryairports. There are currently 25 TCA's. Phase II will implement a transponder with Mode C requirement in the airspacein the vicinity (10 nautical miles) of ARSA primary airports. Phase IIbecomes effective on December 30, 1990, and will affect over 135 ARSA's.Also in Phase II, a transponder with Mode C will be required at other designatedairports for which either a TCA or ARSA has not been adopted. Consequently,most aircraft without Mode C transponders will need ATC authorization tofly within 30 nautical miles of a TCA-primary airport, within 10 nauticalmiles of an ARSA-primary airport, or within controlled airspace of otherdesignatad airports that will also require Mode C transponders. Thus, this evaluation, as well as the Mode C rule, assumes that all operatorsof aircraft without Mode C will acquire such equipment rather than circumnavigatethe subject airport. The only aircraft without this equipment will be aircraftwithout electrical systems or others authorized by ATC. Costs to thesetypes of aircraft operators have already been accounted for by the ModeC rule. As a result, aircraft operators impacted by this rule will onlyincur the opportunity cost of capital necessary for them to acquire, install,and maintain Mode C transponders one year earlier than they will be requiredto do so in accordance with Phase II of the Mode C rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">b. Benefits </ITAG>This final rule is expected to generate potential benefits primarily inthe form of enhanced safety to the aviation community and the flying public.Such safety, for instance, will take the form of reduced casualty losses(namely, aviation fatalities and property damage) resulting from a loweredlikelihood of midair collisions because of increased positive control inairspace to be established by the TCA. In addition, potential benefitsare expected to accrue in the form of improved operational efficiency onthe part of FAA air traffic controllers. Ordinarily, the potential benefits of this rule would be the reductionin the probability of midair collisions resulting from converting the formerARSA to a TCA. However, because of the recent Mode C rule (and to someextent, the rule for Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS),54 FR 940, January 10, 1989), the number of potential midair collisionsavoided by this rule is expected to be significantly lower. Nevertheless,this TCA rule is still expected to accrue benefits in terms of enhancedsafety, though on a much smaller scale. This point can be illustrated with the use of statistical models basedon actual and projected critical near midair collision (NMAC) incidentsin lieu of actual midair collisions. (A critical NMAC is an event involvingtwo aircraft coming within 100 feet of each other; the fact that they donot collide is not due to an action on the part of either pilot, but, rather,is due purely to chance.) Since midair collisions involving part 135 aircraft,and especially part 121 aircraft, are rare, the use of critical NMAC'swill serve to illustrate, to some degree, the potential improvements inaviation safety from implementing this rule. Simple regression analyses were prepared for this evaluation which focusedon critical NMAC's and aircraft operations in the 23 existing TCA's andin a random sample of 23 of the existing 79 ARSA's (as of 1986 and 1987).The results of these analyses indicated that TCA's have approximately 68percent fewer critical NMAC's annually, on average, than ARSA's. Whilethere is no demonstrated relationship between NMAG's and actual midaircollisions, the lower NMAC rate does indicate more efficient separationof aircraft in congested airspace. As the result of these findings, if the former Salt Lake City ARSA hadremained intact (and the recent Mode C and TCAS rules were not in effect),the Salt Lake City Terminal Area would be expected to experience approximately2.1 critical NMAG's annually (or 31 critical NMAC's over the next 15 years).Due to the new TCA, however, this figure could be reduced to approximately0.7 critical NMAC's annually (or 10 critical NMAC's over the next 15 years).Thus, over the next 15 years, this rule could result in a reduction ofapproximately 21 critical NMAC's. However, it is important to note thatmany, if not most, of these potential critical NMAC's will never materializeas predicted primarily because of the Mode C rule and, to some extent,the TCAS rule. According to Phase II of the Mode C rule, all aircraft operating within10 nautical miles (except for flights below the outer 5-mile ``shelf'')of an ARSA-primary airport must be equipped with a Mode C Transponder.Phase I of the Mode C rule requires, as of July 1989, aircraft operatingwithin 30 nautical miles of a TCA to be equipped with a Mode C transponder.These requirements are expected to significantly reduce the risk of midaircollisions in ARSA's and TCA's. For this reason, the primary safety benefitof this rule to create a TCA in November 1989 at Salt Lake City is thatthe safety enhancements of the Mode C and TCAS requirements will occurone year earlier than they otherwise would be expected without this rule.A second safety benefit will be in terms of the lowered likelihood of midaircollisions as a result of expanding the lateral boundaries of mandatoryATC by 20 nautical miles due to the replacement of the Salt Lake City ARSAwith the new TCA.The safety benefits of the establishment of a new TCA, while positive,will be less than would otherwise accrue in the absence of the Mode C andTCAS rules. Since this TCA rule essentially extends the effects of theMode C rule, virtually all of its potential safety benefits are assumedto be part of that rule. Such benefits cannot be estimated separately and,therefore, are considered to be inextricably linked primarily to the ModeC rule. Over a 15-year period, the Mode C rule is expected to generatetotal potential safety benefits of $344 million (discounted, in 1987 dollars).(The Mode C rule benefits estimate of $310 million for 10 years has beenadjusted to a 15 year period for the purpose of comparability with theTCAS rule and other FAA rulemaking actions.) It is important to note thatpart of these potential safety benefits are attributed to the TCAS rule.Thus, the potential safety benefits of this TCA rule and the Mode C andTCAS rules are considered to be inextricably linked.Another potential benefit of this rule will be improved operational efficiencyon the part of FAA air traffic controllers. Under this TCA rule, Mode Ctransponder requirements are expected to ease controller workload per aircraftbeing controlled because of the reduction in radio communications. It willalso make potential traffic conflicts more readily apparent to the controller.As the result of improved operational efficiency, the impact of the controllerworkload increased by separation requirements in the new TCA will be somewhatoffset because of the controller's ability to adjust the volume of VFRtraffic in any given portion of the TCA. Improved operational efficiency should generate other types of benefitsin the form of significant reductions in the number of VFR aircraft requestsdenied and VFR aircraft delayed during busy periods. As the result of convertingthe former Salt Lake City ARSA to a TCA, the improved operational efficiencywill accrue because of the availability of additional air traffic controllersand ATC equipment. If the former Salt Lake City ARSA had remained intact,such air traffic personnel would not be required. Therefore, potentialbenefits of improved operational efficiency, which are not considered tobe quantifiable in monetary terms in this evaluation, are attributed tothis TCA final rule rather than either the Mode C rule or TCAS rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">c. Comparison of Benefits and Costs </ITAG>The total cost that will accrue from implementation of this rule is estimatedto be $2.6 million (discounted, in 1987 dollars). Approximately 4 percentof this total cost estimate will fall on those GA aircraft operators withoutMode C transponders in the form of opportunity costs by requiring themto acquire such avionics equipment, including maintenance, one year soonerthan they otherwise would under the status quo. The typical individualGA aircraft operator impacted will incur an estimated one-time cost rangingfrom $86 to $191 (discounted) under this rule. (As the result of the opportunitycost concept, the derivation of these cost estimates are too complex todiscuss briefly. Therefore, the reader should refer to the detailed regulatoryevaluation, which is contained in the docket, for a full explanation ofthe method by which these cost estimates were derived.) The potential benefits of this rule will be the lowered likelihood of midaircollisions from the conversion of the former ARSA to a TCA. The numberof midair collisions avoided and their respective monetary values cannotbe estimated for this TCA rule independent of the Mode C and TCAS rules;however, the FAA believes that the risk will be substantially reduced.An FAA analysis prepared for this evaluation, however, has shown that criticalnear midair collisions occur approximately two-thirds less frequently ina TCA than in an ARSA. The FAA believes that even after the aviation communitycomplies with the Mode C and TCAS rules, locations converting from ARSA'sto TCA's will continue to experience reduced critical NMAC's. In addition,this rule will generate improved operational efficiency benefits on thepart of FAA air traffic controllers, though they are not considered tobe quantifiable in monetary terms.Clearly, in view of the cost of compliance relative to the significantreduction in the likelihood of midair collisions as well as improved operationalefficiency in the Salt Lake City Terminal Area, the FAA firmly believesthis rule is cost-beneficial.The Regulatory Evaluation that has been placed in the docket contains additionaldetailed information related to the costs and benefits that are expectedto accrue from the implementation of this final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Regulatory Flexibility Determination</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted to ensure thatsmall entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened byGovernment regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules whichmay have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.''The small entities which could be potentially affected by the implementationof this rule are unscheduled operators of aircraft for hire who own nineor fewer aircraft.Virtually all of the aircraft operators impacted by this rule will be thosewho acquire Mode C transponder capability. The FAA believes that all unscheduledaircraft operators (namely, air taxi operators) potentially impacted bythis rule already have Mode C transponders due to the fact that such operatorsfly regularly in or near airports where radar approach control servicehas been established. Even if some of these operators were to acquire,install, and maintain Mode C transponders, the cost would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of them. The annual FAA thresholdfor significant economic impact is $3,700 (1987 dollars) for a small entity.According to FAA Order 2100.14A (Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance),the definition of a small entity, in terms of an air taxi operator, isone with nine aircraft owned, but not necessarily operated.If we were to assume that a particular aircraft operator had nine aircraftwithout transponders, then the annual one-time cost per impacted aircraftwould be approximately $210 (undiscounted, for the purpose of comparabilitywith the figure of $3,700). The total annual one-time cost per small entitywould amount to an estimated $1,890. Thus, the annual worst case cost fora small entity would fall far below the FAA's annual threshold of $3,700.Therefore, the FAA believes this rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">International Trade Impact Assessment</ITAG>This final rule will neither have an effect on the sale of foreign aviationproducts or services in the United States, nor will it have an effect onthe sale of U.S. products or services in foreign countries. This is becausethe rule will only potentially impact small GA aircraft operators withoutMode C, and not aircraft manufacturers. The average cost of acquiring ModeC capability is estimated to range from $900 (to upgrade from a Mode Atransponder) to $2,000 (to acquire a Mode C transponder without havinga Mode A transponder). The cost of acquiring Mode C capability is not consideredto be high enough to discourage potential buyers of small GA airplanes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implications</ITAG>This regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the states,on the relationship between the national government and the states, oron the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levelsof government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, preparationof a Federalism assessment is not warranted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>For the reasons discussed under ``Regulatory Evaluation,'' the FAA hasdetermined that this regulation (1) is not a ``major rule'' under ExecutiveOrder 12291; and (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). It is certifiedthat this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.The FAA has determined that the users of the Salt Lake City InternationalAirport and surrounding area will benefit from the implementation of theTCA. In order to maximize the benefit at the earliest time, the FAA willhave the TCA charted on the next available charting date, which is November16, 1989, and is making the implementation of the TCA effective on thatcharting date. Therefore, due to the need to implement the TCA at the earliestpossible time, the FAA finds good cause for making this amendment effectivein less than 30 days from the date of the publication of this amendment.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71</ITAG>Aviation safety, Terminal control areas, Airport radar service areas.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, part 71 of theFederal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 71) is amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 71_DESIGNATION OF FEDERAL AIRWAYS, AREA LOW ROUTES, CONTROLLEDAIRSPACE AND REPORTING POINTS </ITAG>1.
