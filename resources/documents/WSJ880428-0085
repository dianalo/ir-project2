The company said the test, conducted in a Brentwood, Calif., strawberry patch, again showed the bacteria to be effective in preventing strawberry blossoms from freezing. The company also said there was &quot;no significant amount&quot; of the bacteria that spread outside the test site.    The agricultural-biotechnology company said it hopes to begin the Environmental Protection Agency procedure for registering the bacteria by year end and to bring it to market as early as 1990. </TEXT></DOC>
