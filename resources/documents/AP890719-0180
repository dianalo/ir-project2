The protest was in support of former Presidential Guard commanderCol. Philippe Biamby, one of three officers expelled in April afterattempting a coup.   Dressed in white and clutching a Bible, Biamby's mother, KetlyBiamby, 69, sat in a wicker chair on the sidewalk facing theconsulate when 25 armed police appeared and ordered her and fourother relatives and friends to leave.   Police, who said the group had not obtained a permit for thesit-in, chased away onlookers and journalists.   U.S. Embassy Spokeswoman Susan Clyde said the embassy asked for``police protection, not knowing what sort of demonstration thesit-in could develop into.''   Mrs. Biamby began a hunger strike Monday to protest the detentionby U.S. Immigration authorities of her son and two other formerHaitian officers, Lt. Col. Leonce Qualo and Col. Himmler Rebu.   The three, hospitalized in a medical unit of the MetropolitanCorrectional Center in Manhattan, have been on a hunger strike sinceJune 26.   ``I will go all the way, and die with them if necessary,'' Mrs.Biamby said in front of the consulate in downtown Port-au-Prince.``Will they (U.S. authorities) let us die?''   Charles Troy, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Spokesman inNew York, confirmed Tuesday the three are on a hunger strike. Hesaid they are free to take back their passports and leave if theywithdraw their request for political asylum.   The three were expelled from Haiti to the neighboring DominicanRepublic on April 3 after troops loyal to Haitian ruler Lt. Gen.Prosper Avril foiled their attempted coup the day before.   They flew to Miami two days later and asked for political asylum.They have remained jailed in the U.S. Immigration and NaturalizationService detention facility in New York pending review of theirrequest.   Their detention has stirred controversy in Haiti. IndependentRadio Metropole broadcasts a daily countdown of the number of daysthe three have been jailed.   ``They are victims of an INS policy of racial discrimination''Jacques Biamby, Philippe Biamby's brother, said as police orderedhim away from the Consulate.   Avril, U.S. and other Western diplomats said the coup attempt anda rebellion the following week by two units, also crushed byloyalist soldiers, were financed by supporters of former dictatorJean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier, who fled into exile in France in1986.   Philippe Biamby's father, Pierre Biamby, served as interiorminister and close adviser to Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier, whoruled from 1957 until his death in office in 1971.   Pierre Biamby was linked to the 1964 massacre by Duvalieristthugs of more than 20 mostly wealthy men, women and children inJeremie, on Haiti's southwestern tip.   During the April coup attempt the three ringleaders briefly heldhostage several of Avril's relatives, including his children, wife,80-year-old mother-in-law and an American houseguest.</TEXT></DOC>
