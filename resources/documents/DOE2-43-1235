Large oscillations, which interrupted his original runsat {omega}{sub 0} T{approx_equal}1300 shortly after reaching the O'Neiltrapping level (OTL), were identified and controlled by heating the coldbackground electrons. A run to {omega}{sub 0}T = 30 000 showed growthwell beyond the OTL and eventually saturated at about the level predictedby Simon and Rosenbluth (SR) [Phys. Fluids 19, 1567 (1976)], before oscillationsset in. A run with warmer background electrons was again interruptedby oscillations. A weakly unstable case was followed to {omega}{sub 0}T= 60 000; it also showed growth well beyond the OTL but saturated atan amplitude that was significantly below that predicted by SR. In allcases, the velocity distribution developed strong ripples near v = 0.These are shown to be caused by a numerical grid effect, and they maybe responsible for the eventual development of the large oscillationsand for the low level of saturation in the weakly unstable case.</TEXT></DOC>
