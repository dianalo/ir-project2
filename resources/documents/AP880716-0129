The issue is this: Is the current economic expansion really 67months old, a lifespan that puts it into the great-grandparent agegroup? Or is it a lot younger than that, perhaps only a couple ofyears or so?   To put it another way, are we watching a continued,uninterrupted expansion over the past 67 months, or was there abreak in the record that, perhaps for methodological reasons,wasn't officially recorded?   In short, is it conceivable that we are watching a youngexpansion with room to grow rather than an old and totteringexpansion getting ready for the sickbed? Are we watching thegrandparent, or its offspring?   A recession, which is a break in an expansion, is said to occurwhen the gross national product declines for at least two straightquarters. There is nothing official about that definition; it issimply the one most used.   By that definition, the current expansion began late in 1982 andhas continued since then. But not everyone is willing to accept thedefinition. Times have changed; maybe the definition should, too.   Could it be that the country actually went through a recessionthat just wasn't record as such? According to some people who spenda lot of time examining such things, it isn't just possible butprobable.   To illustrate: In late 1986 the economy was said to be in anexpansion mode. For the nation as a whole, the gross nationalproduct was rising _ and according to the popular concept, thatmeant there was no recession.   Examining the breakdown of the national figures, however, seemedto present a reasonable challenge to the accepted definitions. Thebreakdown showed many industries and many states doing very poorly,and a few doing very well.   The economic numbers from states doing well, mainly on the Eastand West coasts, tended to hide the negative numbers produced inthe nation's midsection by manufacturing, mining, farming andoil-related businesses.   Sindlinger andamp; Co., an economic research firm that conductslengthy personal finance surveys on a regular basis, relegated theeconomies of no less than 31 states to what it says were recessionlevels.   Things turned around after that, however, and early this yearSindlinger's measurements put only four states at recession levels:Oklahoma, Louisiana, West Virginia and Mississippi. Meanwhile, theNew York economy had declined.   The employment and jobless figures suggest something roughlysimilar _ an initial economic advance, a slowdown, and then arenewed period of strength.   Reporting to Congress last week, Janet Norwood, commissioner ofthe Bureau of Labor Statistics, called attention to the phenomenon.   ``We have really had three distinctly different stages of(employment) growth,'' she said.   ``First, a strong initial rebound occurred in the first twoyears following the 1981-1982 recession. Then we had a two-yearperiod of slower, more moderate expansion, and, finally, the lastyear and a half has been a period of strong growth.''   In the past 18 months, she stated, factory and construction jobsrose considerably, and the service-producing sector continued toadvance. All major worker groups had lower jobless rates, with thesharpest drop among adult men.   Other respected analysts also have observed the inconsistency ofthe expansion. Edward Yardeni of Prudential-Bache Securities evensuggests that deep recessions have been replaced by ``rollingreadjustments.''   The term is not an empty euphemism, but refers to the tendencynoted by many others for one section of the nation to pick up theeconomic slack of another and for certain categories of industriesto strengthen while others weaken.   The national statistics might not show a recession or expansionhas occurred. But the residents of those areas and the workers inthose industries do not rely on the statistics. They know.   Some of them will tell you that no matter what the learned folkssay about a 67-month expansion, they have been through a recession.And for many of them, the economic expansion is brand new andprobably headed for a long life.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Monday July 18</NOTE></DOC>
