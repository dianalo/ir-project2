Coal pyrolysis was carriedout under helium atmosphere (0.1 MPa) in a fixed bed with a heating rateof 7 C/min. Tar was extracted from liquid phase with methylene chlorideand separated into maltenes and asphaltenes by treating with n-pentaneand benzene. The maltenic fraction represented 80% of the total low temperaturetar. Both fractions were then separated into aliphatic, aromatic andpolar subfractions by silica-gel chromatography. The i.r. examinationof subfractions showed the presence of aromatic structures with shortchain alkyl substituents, phenolic hydroxyls, carbonyl and aromatic ethergroups. The {sup 1}H n.m.r. spectra showed significant differences inhydrogen distribution. Starting from i.r. and n.m.r. data, structuralparameters such as aromaticity, degree of aromatic substitution and condensationwere calculated for each subfraction. 7 refs., 4 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
