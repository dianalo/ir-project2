The move was denounced immediately by labor unions.    Transportation Secretary James Burnley, in announcing the long-awaited rules, said they &quot;will take us as far as practically possible&quot; toward establishing a drug-free transportation system. The department estimated that the rules will cost industry $2 billion over 10 years to administer, but result in $8.7 billion in benefits from fewer accidents, lower absenteeism and other reductions in drug-related problems.    The most controversial requirement is for random drug testing, which labor unions contend is unconstitutional. The rules also require that a worker be tested before he or she is hired, at regular medical examinations, for reasonable cause when drug use is suspected and after accidents. The rules are to take effect for larger companies -- those with 50 or more employees -- in December 1989 and for smaller companies a year later. The tests will detect the presence of marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines and phencyclidine (PCP).    Mr. Burnley's order, announced at a news conference crowded with reporters and union officials, represents the government's first large-scale requirement that private-sector employees be tested for drug use.    But its future is cloudy. The Owner-Operators Independent Drivers Association of America Inc., which represents 9,000 independent truckers, filed suit yesterday in federal district court in San Francisco, challenging the drug-testing requirements as an invasion of privacy and an unconstitutional search. Unions representing airline pilots and railroad workers were talking about doing the same, as well as about going to Congress for relief.    In addition, two drug-testing cases pending before the Supreme Court could have a major effect on the new rules. The court's decisions are expected next spring, before the department's regulations go into effect.    Moreover, there are big questions about how drug tests for interstate truck drivers will be accomplished and enforced. Many of the nation's three million truck drivers are independent owner-operators; they own their own trucks and run their own businesses. According to a Transportation Department official, they can comply with the rules either by joining a pool of other independent truckers for purposes of drug testing or by participating in the programs set up by the big trucking companies.    The truckers won't be required to carry documentation showing they had undergone drug tests. Therefore, government officials will only be able to check compliance by visiting their places of business and combing through records.    The rules cover about 538,000 aviation-industry employees; three million interstate truck and bus drivers; 90,000 railroad employees, who already are subject to limited alcohol and drug testing under Federal Railroad Administration rules; 195,000 mass-transit workers, 120,000 merchant seamen and 116,500 employees of pipeline companies that transport natural gas and hazardous liquids.    Mr. Burnley, in arguing for the need for drug testing, said that since January 1987 there have been 60 rail accidents in which one or more employees have tested positive for drug use. Thirty-three people have been killed in those crashes. He also pointed to other drug-related accidents, including a January 1988 commuter-aircraft crash in Durango, Colo., in which nine people were killed. The pilot tested positive for cocaine use.    A number of major industry groups, including the Air Transport Association, which represents the major airlines, and the American Trucking Associations, which represents trucking companies, voiced support for the rules. &quot;The public deserves to know we are drug-free,&quot; said Lana Batts, a vice president for the trucking group. But she added that the department should have required testing of intrastate truck drivers as well.    Union officials vowed to fight the rules vigorously. Henry Duffy, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents 40,000 commercial-airline pilots, blasted the random drug-testing provision as the &quot;wrong fix&quot; and said the union would challenge it in court. &quot;We don't even know if there is a drug problem in aviation,&quot; he said.    Lawrence Mann, a Washington attorney who represents the 16 major rail unions on this issue, said he was worried about the accuracy of drug-testing labs. He also criticized the rules for not requiring companies to provide rehabilitation for employees who test positive.    Mr. Burnley acknowledged that as many as 10% of tests will result in false positives, but said a more-stringent follow-up test will correct any inaccuracies. He also said the department didn't mandate rehabilitation for employees because that question should be left to the collective-bargaining process. </TEXT></DOC>
