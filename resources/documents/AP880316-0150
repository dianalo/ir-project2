Just fine, says botanist Charles Nelson, whose desk is clutteredwith samples from all over the country.   The sprigs of green have been arriving in response to an appealby Nelson, who is conducting the first survey of the state ofIreland's national plant in nearly a century.   His timing is perfect, since Thursday is St. Patrick's Day, whenIrish minds turn to the ``chosen leaf of bard and chief, Old Erin'snative Shamrock'' and men, women and children adorn their lapelswith a sprig picked from garden, roadside or local supermarket.   But the shamrock's life is as fleeting as a ray of sunshine inthe Irish rain, and by the end of Thursday's St. Patrick's Dayparade through Dublin the streets will be littered with wiltedshamrock.   Myths galore surround the three-leafed weed.   St. Patrick is supposed to have used the three leaves to explainthe Holy Trinity to a Gaelic chieftain. In the 18th century theIrish establishment accepted it as a national symbol, like theWelsh leek, Scottish thistle and English rose.   It was later adopted as a symbol of defiance in the fight forIreland's independence from Britain.   ``Viva la, the rose shall fade, And the shamrock shine for evernew!'' sang Thomas Davis, the 19th-century rebel bard.   Today the shamrock emblem adorns everything from the nationalairline to bags of peat moss fertilizer.   But what exactly is the shamrock?   In 1893, Dublin legal clerk Nathaniel Colgan set out tocatalogue all the species, and concluded there were four main kinds.   Nelson concludes the shamrock is merely a humble clover toooften dressed up in ``colorful legend and sentimental nonsense.''The word shamrock derives from Seamrog, Irish for ``littleclover,'' he said.   Nelson held up two plastic bags of shamrock. One, sent to himfrom County Down in Northern Ireland, had large-leafed shamrocks.The other, from County Wicklow in the south, had much smaller,darker leaves.   ``This one is shamrock because the person who collected itbelieved it to be shamrock, and I accept that. And the same goesfor the other one too,'' he said in an interview.   ``It's a matter of a rose by any other name smelling just assweet. A shamrock is what a person believes is shamrock,'' he said,adding:   ``Botanically the plants used as shamrock are in fact clover.But if you tell an Irishman that he's wearing clover, not shamrock,he will feel insulted.''   Tom Coleman, who markets shamrock souvenirs, has his owndefinition: ``You know it when you see it.''   Coleman's factory 100 miles south of Dublin, turns out 300,000souvenirs a year, from key rings to ornamental plates, alldecorated with real shamrock preserved by a secret formula.   ``We have a shamrock here that's 17 years old and still green,''he said.   Nelson said there was no basis for the story about St. Patrickand the shamrock, saying that only in 1650, more than 1,000 yearsafter the patron saint of Ireland lived, was the shamrock firstrecorded as being something more than an weed.</TEXT></DOC>
