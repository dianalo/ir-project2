J. Gawlick Shepherds House Blackwells Street Dingwall Ross-shire,Scotland IV15 9NWandM;TechnobabbleandM;As one who prides himself on being a literate technical professional, I readthe February News Track with horror.andP;  In the item &quot;High-Tech Tots&quot; the sin ofpolluting the English language is committed four times in a single sentence.andO;It notes that a baby food company is &quot;pushing software programs that allowtechnically happening parents to analyze junior's individual nutritionalrequests and growth milestones.&quot;andM;This is so much high-flown, yuppified, over-inflated technobabble.andP;  Thephrase &quot;software programs&quot; is redundant and only reflects the modern penchantfor using two words where one will do.andP;  Infants who consume baby food do notmake &quot;individual nutritional requests.&quot; They cry when hungry and refuse foodthey do not like.andP;  Babies do not achieve &quot;growth milestones.&quot; If healthy,they gain height and weight at a rate physicians consider normal.andP;  The mostglaring instance of pollution is the phrase &quot;technically happening.&quot; Is thissupposed to mean parents who have home computers, VCRs, CD players, or whohold technical degrees? Is this a phrase for yuppies to include in theirlexicons along with &quot;parenting,&quot; &quot;birthing,&quot; and  grazing?&quot;andM;I would appreciate the editors of our fine publication screening morecarefully the tortured prose sometimes submitted to them.andM;Lawrence R. Daley 1025 Spring Run Rd. Lexington, KY 40514andM;U.S.andP;  and Them?andM;The December 1989 issue of Communications had in the ACM News section (pp.andO;1495-1496) two related items, one about the ACM cosponsored conference on&quot;Strategic Directions in Computing Research,&quot; the other on the ACM becoming amember of the Computing Research Board (at the cost of $100,000).andP;  The mainpurpose of the conference was to support the U.S.andP;  government's&quot;High-Performance Computing&quot; proposal.andP;  The Computing Research Board has awider, but similar, purpose.andP;  The january 1990 Communications had thePresident's letter (p.andP;  3) strongly urging us (presumably as members of ACM)to write to our Senators to support the National High-Performance Computinginitiative.andM;As a non-U.S.andP;  member of ACM for many years, the above-mentioned led me tomuse whether maybe I joined the wrong association.andP;  After all, whatever myfeelings about whose technology is the best or whose system is the best, Icertainly will not write my Senator about it (Senators in Canada are nobody'sin particular-so far), and to &quot;maintain U.S.andP;  leadership in informationtechnology&quot; (December, page 1495) or &quot;America's [sic] leadership role incomputers&quot; (january, page 3) is not something I am too concerned with.andP;  So Ichecked the purposes of the ACM, printed in the masthead of every issue ofthe Communications, and nowhere in it is it said or implied that it is anational, meaning U.S., association or that promoting the exclusive interestof the U.S.andP;  government or the U.S.andP;  industry is amongst its goals.andM;After some initial grumbling, I was ready to move on.andP;  After all, it was notthe first time that an article which appeared in Communications promoted U.S.andO;interests exclusively (the latest before that was about HDTV and itsconsequences).andP;  Then I received the latest issue of Computer Graphics, thepublication of SIGGRAPH, of which I am also a (still non-U.S.) member (it isthe August 1989 issue, vol.andP;  23, no.andP;  4, even though it was received inFebruary 1990).andP;  From page 275 to page 292 were several statements anddocuments about the &quot;National HighPerformance Computer Technology Act,&quot; alsoknown as Bill S.1067.andP;  There, the message (by Donna Cox, in her position asDirector on the SIGGRAPH executive committee) was even stronger, asking us(this time as members of SIGGRAPH) to write our congressman [sic] andgenerally lobby in favor of strengthening and promoting U.S.andP;  industryinterests.andP;  This time I had to write, since SIGGRAPH is a lot closer to myheart and interests than ACM as a whole.andM;Let me be clear about what my objection is.andP;  I understand perfectly that U.S.andO;citizens, or anybody for that matter, may want to keep or establish theleadership of the U.S.andP;  in whatever category they desire (I say understand, Iam not saying I approve).andP;  I also understand that they lobby theirgovernments, ask for subsidies to industry, even ask for tariff and otherprotections from foreign products (again I do not say I approve, I say thatit is their right to ask).andP;  My problem is that if they do so as the ACM or asSIGGRAPH, of which I am a (definitively non-U.S.) member, where does thatleave me? Not only these actions are not of my concerns, they might even beagainst some of my interests (after all, my country in this case, Canada, hassome high technology aspirations of its own).andP;  There are two possibleanswers: either, unnoticed to me, ACM and SIGGRAPH are nationalorganizations; or members from every country are welcome.andP;  If it is theformer, then the foreign members of ACM and SIGGRAPH should be asked firmly(and of course politely) to withdraw, as they do not belong.andP;  I would beupset not to have been told up front, and I would miss SIGGRAPH sorely; but Iwould understand and try to find truly international equivalent associations(of course I think it also would be a loss for ACM and SIGGRAPH; in thisrespect I would like to know what is the proportion of non-U.S.andP;  members inACM and SIGGRAPH).andP;  If it is the latter, then we as organizations (be it ACMor SIGGRAPH) should not proselytize for causes that are strictly in onecountry's interest.andP;  Of course, in this case that does not prevent subgroups(SIGUS?) to form for the particular purpose of promoting U.S.andP;  interests, aslong as they are not in flagrant conflict with the association's generalpurpose.andM;I would appreciate comments from people who know the official lines and fromany interested members.andM;Alain Fournier Dept.andP;  of Computer Science Univ.andP;  of British ColumbiaVancouver, British Columbia Canada V6T 1W5 FOURNIER@CS.UBC.CAandM;The Search for SmallandM;The letter from Nathaniel Borenstein in the February Forum (p.andP;  109),commenting on the November &quot;General News&quot; item about the recently obtainedrecord prime number, says that the statement that the new prime &quot;has morethan 600 times as many digits as the number of atoms in the known universe&quot;implies that &quot;there are fewer than 109 atoms in the universe.&quot; By me, itimplies that &quot;the number of atoms in the universe has less than 109 digits&quot;(in fact, it has a lot less than that!).andP;  The suspicion that &quot;the articleshould have said that the new prime itself, rather than its number of digits,is more than 600 times as large as the number of atoms in the known universe&quot;is also wrong.andP;  This letter obviously did not clarify anything.andM;Don Cohen Information Sciences Institute Univ.andP;  of Southern California 4676Admiralty Way Venice, CA 90292-6695andM;The largest known prime numbers are truly mind-boggling as is vividlydemonstrated by the letter from Nathaniel S. Borenstein (FebruaryCommunications, p. 109), whose mind was thoroughly boggled.andP;  By printing theletter the editors seem to agree with him, thus revealing their own&quot;bogglement.&quot; I cannot believe they would be so cruel as to knowingly printsuch horrible mistakes for 50,000 ACM members to see.&quot;andM;Let us say that the decimal representation of the number of atoms in theknown universe has about 109 digits, to use Borenstein's number.andP;  It isprobably right within a factor of a billion or so.andP;  The decimalrepresentation of the new prime has 65,087 digits.andP;  This is what was meant bythe statement in the original news item, and it was not confusing to thosewho were already familiar with both numbers.andM;Is it possible to get a feel for the meaning of such large numbers? Probablynot, but let us have a go at it.andP;  Take the number of atoms in the universe as10[.sup.108], a 109-digit number.andP;  Multiply it by ten and it becomes10[.sup.109], a 110-digit number.andP;  We made it ten times as large (tenuniverses!),andM;It only grew by one digit.andP;  Multiply it by 600, as Borenstein suggests, andit only grows by two or three digits to maybe 111 digits.andP;  Not enough.andP;  Weare looking for 65,087 digits! Let us multiply it by something big-itselfsay.andP;  We get a number with 217 digits.andP;  This means that if we take each atomin the universe and replace it with a universe, the number of atoms in thenew collection is a 217-digit number.andP;  Take each atom in this collection andreplace it with a universe.andP;  We then have a number with 325 digits.andP;  Do itagain, and we have number with 433 digits.andP;  Do it 602 times, and we get anumber with 65,017 digits.andP;  Close enough! We are only off by a factor of1070.andP;  We have taken the number of atoms in the universe and raised it to the602nd power.andP;  The number has no conceivable physical meaning.andP;  Perhaps thishelps give a feel for the size of the numbers involved, but I doubt it.andP;  Itdoes not help me.andP;  My mind boggles.andM;Alfred C. Anderson ARAMCO Box 6283 Dhahran 31311 Saudi ArabiaandM;C, P, andamp; Q of W-LandM;In &quot;Computerization, Productivity, and Quality of Work-Life&quot; (Communications,February 1989), Kraut, Dumais, and Koch help perpetuate some conceptualconfusions that are endemic in writing on computerization and other forms oftechnological change.andP;  Their detailed and empirically rich study alsoembodies many virtues.andP;  But the way they characterize the subject matter oftheir study-i.e., as the &quot;effects of information technology&quot; (p.andP;  220) onwork life-needs to be re-thought.andP;  In fact, it is misleading to ascribe theeffects that they detail to information technology or, indeed, any strictlytechnological consideration.andP;  The consequences of &quot;computerization&quot; as theydescribe it are not really inherent in the technology, for differentmanagement intent could well have led to much different results inimplementing the technologies in question.andM;Most of us who have written on these subjects have, no doubt, helped tosustain these confusions at one time or another, so I hardly hold myselfblameless.andP;  The temptation to bracket all the things that happen in the wakeof change from one technology to another as technological effects is hard toresist, because it normally goes unnoticed.andP;  But the effect of such neglectcan be to blind us to distinctions that are essential in the analysis ofsocial change.andM;The authors describe the transition of a customer service department of a&quot;large public utility&quot; from manual to computerized information storage.andP;  Thework thus computerized involved checking clients' billing records, seekingpayment for bills, explaining billing discrepancies to clients, and sellingnew services.andP;  All these activities were accomplished over the phone, bothbefore and after the computerization of work.andP;  But the computerized systemmade records available on line to service representatives whereas the earliersystem had required the representatives to access these records manually.andM;The article leaves no doubt as to the management interests guiding thistransition: &quot;.andP;  .  .  the computerized record system was one element of alabor-reduction strategy .andP;  .  .  &quot; they write.andP;  The innovations involvedefforts to reduce non-job-related activities during the working day.andP;  Thearticle says:andM;The office layout also changed; square arrangements of four desks separatedby portable panels replaced rows of desks, disrupting familiar seatingarrangements and friendship patterns, and making informal chatting moredifficult.andP;  [sic]andM;These were just a few of the multifaceted changes involved in the transition;others included an increased work load and closer enforcement, via thecomputer, of certain long-ignored work rules.andM;The authors report a number of measures of &quot;technological impact,&quot; includingboth developments that most people would consider positive (e.g., staffreported many common tasks as easier) and those that would strike most of usas negative (e.g., decreased job satisfaction).andP;  Yet, it would be difficultto argue that any of these outcomes represents a necessary result of thespecific technologies involved.andP;  It would be more accurate simply to statethat the new work experiences resulted from certain management decisionsabout how new work arrangements, including some new information technologies,were to be deployed.andM;At several points, the authors seem to acknowledge this idea; for example:andM;How did these changes [a decline in the job satisfaction and quality] occur?andO;...  they resulted partly from changes in social interaction, based on newseating arrangements, new privacy panels, and service representatives'limited physical movement that come from their coordinating informationthrough a database rather than through word of mouth and the transfer ofdocuments.andP;  In this setting part of the decrease in job quality ...andP;  was theresult of changes in office layout and architecture that were ancillary tomodifications in office procedure and only loosely linked to computerization.andM;In fact, the authors might make such observations about many of thedifferences they note in their subjects' job experience before and afterintroduction of computerized work routines.andP;  All aspects of &quot;computerization&quot;bear the stamp of management intent and interest.andP;  It would be very difficultto show that any particular aspect of the changes ensuing from thereorganization of work reported by Kraut et al.andP;  would necessarily haveensued from the introduction of the technologies involved, regardless of theinterests and auspices under which they were introduced.andP;  Thus, the authorsdraw what I consider to be precisely the wrong conclusion:andM;At a minimum this analysis suggests that the definition we use oftechnological impact must to [sic] expanded substantially to include thesenonintrinsic changes in work place and work procedure that often gohand-in-hand with the introduction of computer technology.andM;Bracketing all developments subsequent to change in information technologywithin organizations as &quot;effects of technology&quot; is hardly a desirablesolution to the conceptual problem confronted here.andP;  Yet, from this passageto the end of their article, the authors continue to discuss their findingsas &quot;effects of technology,&quot; &quot;technological impact,&quot; etc.andM;Strictly speaking, the effects of technology have to be understood as effectsthat ensue consistently and necessarily across some significant and definablerange of circumstances in which the technology is introduced.andP;  Thus,computing might be said to have &quot;privacy-invading effects,&quot; when madeavailable to powerful organizations with longstanding interests in keepingcloser track of the lives of the people they deal with.andP;  Or, snowmobilesmight justly be said to undermine community solidarity when introduced amongarctic communities with self-sufficient, traditional ways of life [1].andP;  Herethere are good reasons to believe that, given the interests and socialarrangements likely to attend introduction of particular technologies,specific effects are very likely to ensue.andM;But I do not see how Kraut, Dumais, and Koch make a case of this kind for the&quot;technological effects&quot; that they document.andP;  Perhaps such a case could bemade for one broad category of these effects-the increases in productivitythat were the intended and largely realized results of the managementinterventions involving technological change.andP;  In general, one might arguethat rational managers do not invest in new technologies or anything elsewithout some reason to believe that increased organizational advantage willensue; and such beliefs are arguably more likely to be correct thanincorrect.andP;  But, it would be much more difficult to build such an argumentfor another broad category of effects documented by the authors-the declinein quality of work life.andP;  For there, the same technologies might well beguided by more sensitive, less manipulative management decisions.andP;  And onemight imagine that some managers, under some not improbable circumstances,might make such decisions.andM;The lesson to be drawn from these reflections is that analyzing the effects&quot;of information technology on complexes of social arrangements is moreexacting than we often let on.andP;  To be meaningful, such studies have to domore than compare social situations before and after new technologies areinstated.andP;  They must provide convincing accounts of how particular socialconstraints can be expected to guide the use of technologies in somecircumscribed population of settings.andP;  Such a strategy hardly requires thatwe regard technologies as devoid of qualities that lend themselves to oneform of use or sponsorship versus another.andP;  But it does demand that anyinterpretation of technological effects stipulate what sorts of socialarrangements are apt to guide the technologies and how regularly sucharrangements can be expected to yield the effects in question.andM;REFERENCEandM;1.andP;

This column willandM;compare the results of this surveyandM;with a report jointly written by 10andM;intellectual property scholars [1]andM;concerning copyright protection forandM;look and feel and other aspects ofandM;user interfaces.andP;  The CHI survey resultsandM;are, in general, consistent withandM;the scholars' conclusions based onandM;copyright principles [4].andP;  The legalandM;experts see a basis in copyright lawandM;for denying copyright protection toandM;look and feel, which is what theandM;user interface field thinks would beandM;in the field's best interest.andM;The results of the CHI survey canandM;be summarized briefly.andP;  More thanandM;80 percent of the 667 respondents toandM;the survey opposed copyright protectionandM;for the look and feel of userandM;interfaces, although they stronglyandM;supported copyright protection forandM;source and object code.andP;  They regardandM;the kind of strong copyright protectionandM;being sought in the current lookandM;and feel lawsuits as likely to have aandM;negative effect on their own workandM;and on the user interface designandM;community and industry.andP;  They opposeandM;strong copyright protection forandM;user interfaces because they thinkandM;such protection would adversely affectandM;the climate of open exchangeandM;and discussion of research and designandM;innovations that has broughtandM;progress to the field.andM;Background on the CHI SurveyandM;To assist the user interface designandM;community in becoming moreandM;aware of the legal issues involved inandM;the current round of look and feelandM;lawsuits, Pamela Samuelson organizedandM;and moderated a 90-minuteandM;legal debate on copyright protectionandM;for user interfaces as a plenary sessionandM;at CHI  89 [2].andP;  The debate featuredandM;Jack Brown, the chief lawyerandM;for Apple Computer in the Apple-MicrosoftandM;litigation, and ThomasandM;Hemnes, a former defense lawyerandM;in the Lotus case.andP;  They debated theandM;legal perspectives on the pros andandM;cons of protecting the look and feelandM;of software user interfaces throughandM;copyright law.andP;  Michael Lesk of BellandM;Communications Research was anandM;industry discussant.andM;Brown's argument emphasized theandM;significant amount of creative workandM;that went into the design of a userandM;interface and the role of copyright inandM;protecting those whose intellectualandM;labor had produced a valuable productandM;from those who found it easierandM;to imitate a creative work than to doandM;something creative themselves.andM;Hemnes pointed out that not everyandM;valuable intellectual product wasandM;protectable by copyright law.andP;  Moreover,andM;copyright law should andandM;would respect nonprotection of certainandM;aspects of intellectual worksandM;would further progress in a field.andM;We realized the CHI legal debateandM;would provide a unique and efficientandM;opportunity to survey a largeandM;sample of the user interface fieldandM;about the legal issues.andP;  Such a surveyandM;should not be distributed until afterandM;the lawyers had had their say, soandM;the audience would have been educatedandM;about the terms of the legalandM;controversy and each side had presentedandM;its view.andP;  As the debate drewandM;to a close, Samuelson informed theandM;audience about the survey beingandM;distributed to them, and said althoughandM;judges would make the finalandM;rulings on the look and feel lawsuits,andM;this was a chance for representativesandM;of the user interface designandM;community to vote on the legalandM;issues, and urged them to do so.andP;  BeforeandM;filing out of the auditorium, 667andM;members of the audience filled outandM;the survey.andM;A Profile of Survey RespondentsandM;The survey asked a number of questionsandM;about the respondents andandM;their firms so it would be possible toandM;analyze whether characteristics ofandM;the respondents or their firms mightandM;predict their views on the look andandM;feel lawsuits and related issues.andP;  ForandM;example, respondents were asked toandM;select from a list of job functions theandM;one or two descriptions that best fitandM;(1.68 was the average rate of responseandM;by job function).andP;  Table IandM;shows the respondents' profile byandM;job function for the most frequentlyandM;indicated categories.andM;Respondents were also asked toandM;identify the one best description ofandM;the organization or company forandM;which they work.andP;  Table II reflectsandM;the results of this question.andP;  The surveyandM;did not ask respondents to identifyandM;the organization or firm forandM;which they worked, but since theandM;respondents made up 42 percent ofandM;the total conference registration, thisandM;information provides a reasonableandM;substitute without compromisingandM;the identity of particular respondents.andM;The 10 organizations with theandM;highest number of attendees at CHIandM;'89 were, in decreasing rank order:andM;IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Apple, MCCandM;(the host organization in Austin),andM;ATandamp;T, Texas Instruments, Xerox,andM;Bell Communications Research,andM;the University of Michigan, andandM;Carnegie-Mellon University.andP;  InandM;addition to look and feel litigantsandM;Hewlett-Packard, Apple, and XeroxandM;in positions two, three, and five,andM;there were several representativesandM;each from Ashton-Tate Lotus, andandM;Microsoft in attendance.andM;None of the factors characterizingandM;the survey respondents were foundandM;to predict statistically significant differencesandM;in their answers to theandM;questions concerning the role ofandM;copyright and patent in the protectionandM;of various aspects of software orandM;concerning predicted effects ofandM;strong copyright protection.andP;  In viewandM;of the support the survey gives toandM;the minimalist interpretation of theandM;appropriate reach of copyright lawandM;as applied to software [21, it is worthandM;pointing out that the respondentsandM;were among the leading designersandM;and researchers in their field, responsibleandM;for creating many of theandM;most commercially valuable user interfacesandM;in the software industry.andM;They typically worked for commercialandM;firms that rely on copyrightandM;law to protect their software productsandM;[4].andM;Survey Findings on ProtectionandM;of Look and FeelandM;One of the principal findings of theandM;survey was that the user interfaceandM;field thinks the look and feel of userandM;interfaces should not be given protectionandM;by copyright or patent law.andM;Some 77 percent of the respondentsandM;with an opinion felt that look andandM;feel should not be given protectionandM;by either copyright or patent law,andM;while 82 percent opposed copyrightandM;protection for look and feel.andM;Quite a few of the survey respondentsandM;explained their reasons for opposingandM;legal protection for look andandM;feel of user interfaces.andP;  Some saidandM;they were not sure what look andandM;feel meant.andP;  Some were unsure howandM;similar interfaces could be in lookandM;and feel before infringement mightandM;be found.andP;  Others thought look andandM;feel related largely to functionalitiesandM;of the interface which copyrightandM;should not protect.andP;  Still others expressedandM;concern for the effect on theandM;users, as well as the industry, if theandM;pending look and feel lawsuits establishedandM;strong copyright protectionandM;for user interfaces [4].andM;In addition to asking about lookandM;and feel, the survey asked for viewsandM;about legal protection of five otherandM;aspects of user interfaces, all ofandM;which (either explicitly or implicitly)andM;are at issue in the currentandM;round of look and feel cases.andP;  TheandM;survey revealed even stronger oppositionandM;to copyright protection forandM;commands, user interface functionalities,andM;and screen sequence than toandM;look and feel protection, as well asandM;strong (but somewhat less opposition)andM;to such protection for screenandM;layouts.andP;

Icons wereandM;the aspect of user interfaces forandM;which there was strongest sympathyandM;for protection, but not even this featureandM;enjoyed majority supportandM;among respondents.andP;  Strongest oppositionandM;was registered as to protectionandM;of commands and user interfaceandM;functionalities, with more than 9 ofandM;every 10 respondents objecting toandM;their protection by copyright.andM;Because many of these featuresandM;overlap significantly with the kindandM;of look and feel being sought to beandM;protected in the lawsuits, it is notandM;surprising the respondents wouldandM;view protection of these aspects ofandM;interfaces in much the same wayandM;they viewed protection of look andandM;feel.andM;However, opposition to protectionandM;of look and feel was not part ofandM;wholesale rejection of intellectualandM;property protection for software, asandM;shown in Table 111.andP;  The respondentsandM;overwhelmingly supported intellectualandM;property (and mainly for copyright)andM;protection for source and objectandM;code.andP;  Fully 93 percent of thoseandM;with an opinion supported intellectualandM;property protection, eitherandM;through copyright or patent, forandM;source code.andP;  The 85 percent supportandM;for object code protection wasandM;nearly as strong.andM;As a group, the respondentsandM;strongly supported copyright protectionandM;for source and object code, butandM;did not support copyright protectionandM;for pseudocode or modular design.andM;Least of all did they support copyrightandM;protection for algorithms, althoughandM;nearly 40 percent of the respondentsandM;supported patentandM;protection for algorithms.andM;Predicted Negative Effect fromandM;Copyright Protection forandM;Look and FeelandM;Another major finding of the CHIandM;survey was that respondents regardedandM;the kind of strong copyrightandM;protection being sought in the lookandM;and feel lawsuits as likely to haveandM;a clear negative effect both on theandM;industry/community and on theirandM;own work.andM;In response to a survey questionandM;about the effect such protectionandM;would have &quot;on your own work,&quot;andM;the average rating (on a five-pointandM;scale ranging from &quot;1&quot; for &quot;significantandM;negative effect&quot; to &quot;5&quot; for &quot;significantandM;positive effect&quot;) was 2.049,andM;a clear overall expectation of a negativeandM;effect.andP;  But it was not just aandM;minority of respondents with &quot;significantandM;negative&quot; votes who swayedandM;the average; 72 percent expected aandM;negative impact on their own workandM;(ratings of &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot;) if the currentandM;lawsuits established strong copyrightandM;protection, while only nine percentandM;expected the effect on their work toandM;be positive (ratings of &quot;4&quot; or &quot;5&quot;).andM;The predicted effect &quot;on the userandM;interface design industry/community&quot;andM;was even more strongly negative,andM;with an average rating of 1.646andM;on the same five-point scale.andP;  Indeed,andM;86 percent of the respondents expectedandM;the kind of strong copyrightandM;protection for user interfaces beingandM;sought in the look and feel lawsuitsandM;to have a negative impact on theandM;industry, while only 10 percentandM;viewed the prospect as positive.andM;Table IV gives the results of the respondents'andM;predictions about theandM;likely effect of strong protection onandM;their own work and on the industry.andM;Lest the reader interpret these resultsandM;as only reflecting the opinionandM;of worker bees or ivory-tower types,andM;we hasten to point out that 15 percentandM;of the respondent populationandM;identified themselves as managers,andM;and their responses to the predictionandM;questions and the protectability ofandM;individual features question did notandM;differ in a statistically significantandM;way from the responses of the respondentandM;group as a whole.andP;  TheandM;average predicted industry effectandM;among the managers, for example,andM;was 1.74.andP;  The average responses byandM;job function closest to the managerandM;predictions were those of facultyandM;(1.76), students (1.73) and user interfaceandM;designers (1.72).andP;  All were stillandM;well under a 2.0 rating, which itselfandM;was a negative rating.andP;  Not a singleandM;category of respondents measuredandM;by job function predicted even aandM;neutral, let alone a positive, effectandM;on the industry if the look and feelandM;lawsuits established the kind ofandM;copyright protection being sought.andM;When we compared the answersandM;respondents gave concerning theirandM;predictions of effect on their ownandM;work with their predictions aboutandM;the industry effect, we noted thatandM;while there was some shifting inandM;both directions, people who gaveandM;different ratings on the two questionsandM;were 3.5 times more likely toandM;move in a more negative directionandM;when predicting the industry effect.andM;Particularly striking was the findingandM;that 19 percent of respondents whoandM;expected to be unaffected in theirandM;own work if the current lawsuits establishedandM;strong copyright for userandM;interfaces, 69 percent expected aandM;negative effect for the field.andM;The Extent of RestrictionandM;Perceived at PresentandM;The survey also inquired about theandM;extent of restriction the respondentsandM;currently felt about the use theyandM;could make of the latest researchandM;and design innovations which theyandM;saw or learned about at conferencesandM;such as CHI.andP;  Respondents wereandM;asked to select one of four statementsandM;that best described theirandM;views.andM;1.andP;  No restrictions: I can freely useandM;anything I learn about or see,andM;2.andP;  Some restrictions: I can't copy exactly,andM;but I am allowed to reimplementandM;or reverse engineer anyandM;interesting designs,andM;3.andP;  Significant restrictions: I can copyandM;only general concepts or ideas atandM;the research stage, orandM;4.andP;  Total restrictions: Once I see it atandM;CHI, I know I can't copy it in anyandM;user interface design of my own.andM;Some 31 percent reported feelingandM;&quot;no restrictions&quot; on use of innovationsandM;seen at CHI.andP;  just under half ofandM;the respondents (49 percent) feltandM;only &quot;some restriction.&quot; One 1-in-5andM;respondents reported feeling &quot;significantly&quot;andM;(19 percent) or  totally&quot;andM;(1 percent) restricted in their use ofandM;design innovations seen at CHI.andM;(Here, there were some statisticallyandM;significant responses among respondentsandM;by type of employer.andP;  GovernmentandM;employees felt least restricted,andM;with 64 percent assuming no restrictions.andM;However, even those whoandM;worked for computer manufacturersandM;felt fewer constraints than oneandM;might have guessed, with 24 percentandM;perceiving no restrictions, and anotherandM;50 percent reporting some restrictions.)andM;Not surprisingly, the fewer restrictionsandM;that people currently felt, theandM;more likely they were to expect aandM;negative effect on their own work ifandM;strong copyright protection was establishedandM;by the current lawsuitsandM;about user interface issues.andP;  But evenandM;those who already feel significantandM;restrictions predicted negative consequencesandM;if look and feel protectionandM;was established, with an average ofandM;2.303 on the five-point scale as toandM;their own work, and 1.70 as to theandM;industry/community effect.andP;  TheandM;average response of &quot;no restriction&quot;andM;respondents was 1.464 for theandM;industry/community effect.andM;How the Legal Debate AffectedandM;the Respondents' ViewsandM;Perhaps the most dramatic findingandM;from the survey was the fact thatandM;the more those in the user interfaceandM;field learned about what copyrightandM;lawyers thought about copyrightandM;protection of user interface issues,andM;the more likely they were to thinkandM;copyright protection for user interfacesandM;should be weaker, rather thanandM;stronger.andM;Attendees of the CHI legal debateandM;came with some familiarity of theandM;legal issues involved in the look andandM;feel cases.andP;  Indeed, 64 percent of theandM;respondents rated themselvesandM;as &quot;moderately familiar&quot; with theandM;legal issues before the legal debate,andM;and another 9 percent reportedandM;being  very familiar&quot; with the issues.andM;Given how much press attentionandM;the look and feel lawsuits haveandM;received, and given how importantandM;this community feels the legal issuesandM;to be to the health of their field, thisandM;result in itself is not surprising.andM;What was surprising was howandM;people reacted to copyright protectionandM;for user interfaces after theyandM;had heard the legal debate.andP;  Half ofandM;the respondents indicated that attendingandM;the debate had caused themandM;to change their opinion on copyrightandM;protection.andP;  Ten times as manyandM;changed their minds to thinking thatandM;copyright protection should beandM;weaker than changed to thinking itandM;should be stronger.andM;It was not the case that JackandM;Brown argued less persuasively thanandM;Thomas Hemnes, for Peter Lewis ofandM;the New York Times reported bothandM;sides of the legal debate to beandM;equally persuasive (May 7, 1989).andM;Moreover, a number of respondentsandM;praised Brown's skill in argumentation.andM;The lawyers, quite appropriately,andM;presented arguments based onandM;the issues that copyright law regardsandM;as relevant to deciding legal disputes.andM;What then explains the strongandM;shift toward thinking copyright protectionandM;should be weaker? We believeandM;the CHI audience was not soandM;much persuaded to one legal positionandM;or the other, but awakened toandM;the nature of the legal debate and itsandM;implications for how they workedandM;and for the field in which theyandM;worked.andP;  The comment of one surveyandM;respondent expresses well the authors'andM;interpretation of the outcomeandM;of the legal debate: &quot;The argumentsandM;and session made me very nervousandM;because the arguments againstandM;strong protection were so compellingandM;based on my knowledge of the field,andM;but they may not be anywhere nearandM;as obvious to non-practitioners-andandM;the courts are generally nonpractitioners.&quot;andM;The respondents felt stronglyandM;enough about the predicted harm toandM;their industry that 63 percent ofandM;those who expressed an opinionandM;wanted SIGCHI to take an officialandM;position on the legal issues based onandM;the results of this survey.andP;  Many whoandM;responded &quot;no&quot; to this question saidandM;they did so because they thoughtandM;the entire SIGCHI membershipandM;should be polled before SIGCHI tookandM;an official position.andM;Comparing the CHI Survey ResultsandM;to Law Scholars' ReportandM;In part because of some novel legalandM;questions presented by the softwareandM;copyright lawsuits, a group of 10 intellectualandM;property scholars met lastandM;February at Arizona State UniversityandM;to try to reach consensus on theandM;proper application of copyright lawandM;to the protection of computer programs.andM;Among the questions theyandM;addressed was whether copyrightandM;protection was appropriate for theandM;look and feel of computer programandM;user interfaces.andP;  The confereesandM;agreed it was not, saying that use ofandM;terms like look and feel &quot;obscuresandM;rather than assists in the applicationandM;of copyright principles to softwareandM;interfaces&quot; [1].andP;  The conferees recognizedandM;that software user interfacesandM;may be highly functional, and to theandM;extent they are, that copyright protectionandM;is not available for them, norandM;for functionally optimal expressionsandM;of them.andP;  In addition, the confereesandM;recognized that user interface designandM;may be constrained by technologicalandM;considerations that may limit theandM;range of viable  expressions,&quot; whichandM;would restrict the scope of copyrightandM;protection available to them.andM;The conferees found in traditionalandM;principles of copyright law an affirmationandM;of the right to study and takeandM;unprotected elements from copyrightedandM;programs and reimplementandM;them in other products [1].andP;  WhileandM;accepting that intellectual propertyandM;protection for computer programsandM;should balance the needs of innovatorsandM;and competitors so as to promoteandM;the health of industries suchandM;as that for software, the confereesandM;regarded their aim to be a limitedandM;one of articulating how traditionalandM;copyright principles might be appliedandM;to computer programs, not toandM;offer their judgment about whetherandM;the larger goal of intellectual propertyandM;law can best be served by use ofandM;copyright law to protect computerandM;programs.andM;The conferees, while agreeingandM;with the user interface survey respondentsandM;that individual commandsandM;or even sets of commandsandM;should not be protected by copyright,andM;were not able to reach consensusandM;on whether a less than functionallyandM;optimal arrangement ofandM;commands (or icons) in a user interfaceandM;would be protectable by copyright.andM;Some conferees, like many inandM;the CHI survey population, thoughtandM;the benefits that would flow to usersandM;from standardization of such thingsandM;as command names and commandandM;groupings in software user interfaces,andM;as well as functional reasonsandM;that might exist for grouping certainandM;kinds of commands together, madeandM;it generally inappropriate for copyrightandM;protection to attach to arrangementsandM;of commands.andP;  Other confereesandM;thought that in view of theandM;protection copyright law had traditionallyandM;afforded to compilations,andM;the organization of a set of commandsandM;from one program, if original,andM;might be protected by copyrightandM;from exact duplication in a competingandM;program.andM;The conferees were also in agreementandM;with those in the user interfaceandM;field about some issues relatedandM;to the protection of icons-thatandM;&quot;adoption of a functional generalandM;purpose metaphor might limit theandM;range of copyrightable expression&quot;andM;and when &quot;the choice of icons is logicallyandM;based upon the choice of anandM;overarching metaphor (such as aandM;desktop) or the icon itself has noandM;fanciful characteristics, applicationandM;of traditional principles would precludeandM;copyright protection for theandM;particular representation of theandM;icon.&quot; However, the conferees alsoandM;thought traditional principles ofandM;copyright law might provide protectionandM;for some more fanciful pictorialandM;representation of icons.andP;  The CHIandM;survey respondents, however, didandM;not support copyright protection forandM;icons, perhaps because they perceiveandM;user interface icons as notandM;really having a fanciful character.andM;The CHI survey data suggests theandM;user interface field has developedandM;because people in the field come toandM;conferences such as CHI to shareandM;their new user interface design ideasandM;with others.andP;  When attendees seeandM;good design ideas and the researchandM;that stands behind them, they feelandM;they can incorporate these designsandM;into new products of their own,andM;blending the ideas they have receivedandM;from others with the ideasandM;they have developed themselves.andM;And they do not consider themselvesandM;thieves, plagiarists, or copyrightandM;infringers when they do so.andM;Rather, they consider themselvesandM;scientists and engineers who are innovatingandM;on top of others' ideas inandM;the kind of evolutionary fashionandM;which has exemplified developmentandM;in this field.andM;This evolutionary developmentandM;seems to have brought about a considerableandM;amount of innovation, improvedandM;designs which have madeandM;computers and software more accessibleandM;and usable by those with minimalandM;or no technical training, andandM;competition about performance, enhancedandM;features, and price.andP;  If eachandM;software firm had to develop a differentandM;style of user interface to complyandM;with copyright law, there is concernandM;that copyright might impedeandM;how those in the user interface fieldandM;do their work, might harm theandM;health of the industry, and mightandM;make more difficult the achievementandM;of the goal of making computersandM;usable by ordinary people.andM;CONCLUSIONandM;It is often stated, but nonethelessandM;true, that a fundamental purpose ofandM;the intellectual property laws is toandM;provide protection for innovations inandM;order to give incentives for people toandM;be creative, thereby promoting progressandM;in various fields of endeavor.andM;From this, it follows that where legalandM;protection of some kinds of innovationsandM;is not needed to promote innovationandM;in a field, no protectiveandM;legislation is needed.andP;  Thus, it mustandM;surely be the case that where intellectualandM;property protection wouldandM;have a detrimental effect on innovationandM;in a field, it should be withheld,andM;especially in an era where the lawandM;does not as yet dictate the protectionandM;being sought.andM;In the case of user interfaces, theandM;CHI survey clearly demonstratesandM;that a significant segment of theandM;leading designers and researchersandM;in the user interface field are overwhelminglyandM;opposed to strong copyrightandM;protection for user interfacesandM;and regard such protection as likelyandM;to be harmful to the field, ratherandM;than helpful.andP;  These are the veryandM;people whom the copyright law isandM;supposed to be encouraging to beandM;creative.andP;  Given that copyright lawandM;has, as yet, not formed a firmandM;position about protection of various aspectsandM;of user interfaces discussed inandM;this column-and can be construedandM;to support either side in the legalandM;debate-judges in the current roundandM;of copyright look and feel casesandM;should be receptive to consideringandM;the effect strong protection wouldandM;have on the industry.andM;That the views of the technicalandM;community are largely consistentandM;with views expressed by legal scholarsandM;[1] as to the application of copyrightandM;law to computer programs suggestsandM;that judges in look and feelandM;cases could find an adequate basisandM;in copyright doctrine to do what theandM;user interface field thinks would beandM;in the field's best interest.andM;Acknowledgments.andP;
