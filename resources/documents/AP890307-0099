The latest news from the Labor Department confirmed an initialreport by the department a month ago which showed that productivity,or output per hour of work, turned sluggish in the final threemonths of the year while inflationary pressures intensified.   The 5.6 percent rise in unit labor costs was almost double the3.7 percent rate of increase in the third quarter. Unit labor costsreflect changes in hourly compensation as well as changes inproductivity.   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan last week cited laborcosts as one of the factors behind the central bank's recentdecision to push interest rates higher in an effort to fightinflation.   Analysts said that Tuesday's report, which did not revise theunit labor costs from the initial estimate, would likely add to thecentral bank's resolve to keep pushing interest rates higher,especially if the report on February unemployment, to be released onFriday, comes in as strong as expected.   With demand for workers pushing up against tight labor marketsand high factory operating rates, economists are worried thatresulting pressures are starting to be seen in rising wage demandsby workers and product-price increases on the part of businesses.   ``Almost any reasonable person has to be scared about inflationright now,'' said David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc.of Lexington, Mass. ``There is clear evidence that compensationcosts are accelerating.''   The fear is that if wage demands begin chasing rising consumerprices, the country could be plunged back into a wage-price spiralsimilar to the one in the 1970s that then-Federal Reserve ChairmanPaul Volcker fought with the steep 1981-82 recession.   The 5.6 percent rate of increase for unit labor costs in thefourth quarter reflected a 5.6 percent rise in hourly compensation,which includes wages and salaries as well as fringe benefits.   In the final six months of the year, hourly compensation wasrising at an annual rate of 5.7 percent, a sharp acceleration froman annual rate of 3.9 percent in the first six months of 1988.   Analysts said most of the increase in the final half of the yearreflected rising health insurance costs.   For the year as a whole, productivity increased 1.4 percent,matching the average annual gains since the end of the 1981-82recession.   The final quarter's 0.1 percent rise in nonfarm businessproductivity reflected a 3.7 percent increase in output which wasnearly offset by a 3.6 percent rise in the number of hours worked.The weak advance continued a sawtooth pattern in which a strong gainin one quarter has been followed by a poor showing in the next.   Productivity rose at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the firstquarter of 1988, dropped at a rate of 2.4 percent in the secondquarter and then rebounded at a 2 percent rate in the July-Septemberquarter.   Michael K. Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, saidthat the 1.4 percent advance for the year, while up from a 0.8percent increase in 1987, was still a dismal performance compared tothe rapid gains of 3.3 percent posted in the two decades followingWorld War II when American workers enjoyed healthy wage gains and arising standard of living.   ``This set of figures reinforces the fact that productivitygrowth in this country is still very sluggish,'' he said. ``Ifproductivity is hardly growing at all, that means that people'sstandard of living is not rising either.''   The Bush administration is counting on productivity rising about2 percent a year as a key underpinning of its economic forecastwhich sees the budget deficit being eliminated by the year 1993.   However, many private economists believe this forecast is overlyoptimistic despite a major push by U.S. industry since the lastrecession to modernize production facilities.   Tuesday's productivity report showed that total U.S.productivity, including the farm sector, fell at an annual rate of 2percent in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting the continuedeffects of last summer's severe drought.</TEXT></DOC>
