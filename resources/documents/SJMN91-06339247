Glutamic acid is anamino acid that occurs naturally in all proteins in the human body and infoods. Its concentration varies from protein to protein, but it is present inparticularly high amounts in mushrooms, peas and other vegetables. Whenproteins are broken down, they release individual amino acids. Monosodiumglutamate occurs when glutamic acid joins with sodium.;   For many centuries,Asian cooks used a seaweed flavoring that contained MSG, but in more moderntimes it has been made by fermenting a protein source such as casein. It iscomparatively low in sodium (12 percent vs. 40 percent in table salt), but itis not a good salt substitute for low-sodium diets because it also tastes farless salty than table salt.;   Q What is it used for?;   A It used to beassociated only with Chinese food, where it is widely used as a flavorenhancer, but now it is found in a staggering variety of processed foods,ranging from soups, broths, sauces, gravies and spice blends to many processedmeats and canned or frozen products.;   Q Why so much controversy?;   A TheFood and Drug Administration has put MSG on its &quot;generally recognized as safe&quot;list.;   However, for the last 20 years or so people have talked about acondition which used to be known as the &quot;Chinese Restaurant Syndrome.&quot; Themost common symptoms, which typically occurred during or shortly after eatingChinese food, were warmth, flushing, tightness and numbness in the upper bodyand face, and headaches. As the word spread about the syndrome, the number ofsymptoms attributed to MSG grew in quantity and severity.;   Because the useof MSG has increased dramatically in the last 30 years or so, the claims madeabout its danger have escalated in a similar fashion. In fact, it has becomeone of the most widely studied substances in the world's food supply.Unfortunately, the huge body of research is inconclusive and the controversyover its safety still rages on.;   What we do know is that large doses of anysingle amino acid can be toxic, partly because of the rapidity with which theyare absorbed. Studies on the brains of young animals show toxic effects fromhuge loads of glutamic acid. However, this same effect has not beendemonstrated in young humans.;   Nonetheless, the FDA acknowledges that MSGmay cause unpleasant side effects in particularly sensitive people. (The samecan be said of many other foods and food additives.) Even though the number ofsuch people is likely to be quite small, the potential exposure to higher andhigher doses of MSG makes this a problem the FDA intends to address.;   Atpresent, pure MSG must be labeled as such, but it is often added to othersubstances which end up being labeled as sodium caseinate, autolyzed yeast,hydrolyzed protein and natural flavorings. In these cases, MSG can be presentwithout having to be listed as such.;   It is interesting to note thathydrolyzed protein (protein that has been broken down into its amino acids,including glutamic acid) is taking some of the MSG-generated heat as well.When the glutamic acid released from hydrolyzed protein joins with sodium, itforms MSG.;   Hydrolyzed protein is also used as a flavor enhancer and thereis some evidence that the same people who are sensitive to MSG may also besensitive to hydrolyzed protein. The big problem is that when you add thisform of MSG to the pure MSG that is added to foods, you end up with aparticularly high dosage.;   Until recently, hydrolyzed protein could appearon labels as just natural flavoring, which certainly sounds less intimidating.However, in September, the USDA started requiring processed meat and poultrycompanies to list this and other such additives by name instead of by theirdescription.;   The FDA is looking at doing the same for all other foods. Insuch a way, those people who believe they are sensitive can choose their foodsaccordingly.;   Q What is the best advice?;   A There is no need forwidespread panic. While it is true that MSG and hydrolyzed proteins arepopping up in more and more foods, there is very little evidence that this isbecoming a public health hazard.;   If you are experiencing symptoms you thinkmight be related to additives, try keeping a complete and accuratefood/symptom diary for several months. Carry your diary with you and writedown everything you eat and drink during the day.;   Whenever the suspicioussymptoms occur, write them down as well, making certain to note the date, timeand type of symptom.;   After a few months, go back and see what you ate onthe days when you experienced symptoms. See if any pattern emerges. Check thelabels carefully. Contact the manufacturers or restaurants, if necessary, tofind out if MSG or hydrolyzed protein was present in any form.;   If you donotice a connection, try eliminating the offending foods for a similar periodof time and see if the symptoms go away.;   Until we know a great deal moreabout this problem, there is no reason to avoid any foods that are notbothering you. Most people simply are not affected by this in any noticeableway. MSG is not a dangerous chemical, and nobody is suggesting that it causescancer.;   However -- just to be cautious -- if you are pregnant or nursing,it is probably a good idea to avoid MSG. You should also try not to feed foodscontaining MSG to babies and, in fact, manufacturers have removed it fromcommercial baby foods.;   If you are eating out, especially in restaurantsthat specialize in Asian or Latin American food, do not be afraid to ask ifthe food is prepared with MSG. Most good restaurants will leave it out if youwish and you probably will not notice much difference in taste.;   The mostimportant advice: Try to eat a variety of foods and make sure that as many ofthem as possible are fresh and not highly refined or processed.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DR.
