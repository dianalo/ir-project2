Like their economies, the currencies of the U.S. and Canada are closely related. But as interest rates rise in Canada, the Canadian dollar is gaining on its U.S. counterpart, traders and analysts say. And as the Canadian unit rises, it lures more foreign investment -- particularly from Japan -- which adds to its strength.    Canada's narrowing budget deficit, deregulation of its financial markets and a perceived bottoming of commodity prices also have whetted investor appetite for the Canadian currency.    &quot;Our recommendation is buy Canada,&quot; says Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., New York. &quot;That implies that anything denominated in Canadian dollars should do well.&quot;    Because the Canadian and U.S. currencies are closely related, both have tumbled steadily against the major European and Japanese units over the past 22 months. But the daily movements between the Canadian and U.S. units usually are relatively small.    In late New York trading Friday, the Canadian dollar stood at 73.61 U.S. cents, up from 73.56 U.S. cents Thursday. On Wednesday, the Canadian unit climbed to 73.71 U.S. cents, its highest level since August 1985.    No one is predicting the Canadian dollar will undergo a full recovery after slipping for about a decade. But for the short run, 74.35 U.S. cents is in sight, says James M. Pugh, vice president and corporate foreign-exchange manager at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York.    Last February, the Canadian dollar was setting lows. Speculators shunned the currency over concerns about then-plunging prices for oil and other commodities, which account for a major portion of Canadian exports. A relatively wide federal budget deficit and what was viewed as a negative business climate were also factors. The Canadian dollar hit bottom at 69.24 U.S. cents during February, although it had climbed to slightly more than 70 cents by month's end.    Its recovery has been a halting one. A summer surge in tourism, a better-than-expected economy and the belief that the business environment has improved got things rolling. Subsequently, however, the currency's value meandered. But over the past several weeks, the Canadian dollar has risen against the U.S. currency just as the American unit crashed against the Japanese yen and West German mark.    The recent rise in the Canadian currency was good news for American officials. While the U.S. dollar has fallen sharply against such currencies as the yen and the mark since the September 1985 accord was reached to lower its value in order to narrow the American trade deficit, it hadn't declined against such currencies as those in Canada, Taiwan and South Korea. A weaker dollar makes U.S. exports more competitive.    The U.S. has been quietly pressuring Taiwan and Korea to stop trying to block their currencies from appreciating. But Treasury Secretary James Baker, who visited Ottawa last week, reassured Canadian officials that the U.S. has no complaints about Canada's policies toward its currency, the officials said. Mr. Baker said Thursday that &quot;to the best of our knowledge, the Canadians do not manipulate the exchange rate to take advantage on trade.&quot;    Traders and analysts say the latest increase in the Canadian dollar is partly caused by Japanese investors. &quot;The Japanese have switched to buying Canadian dollars,&quot; says Frank Pusateri, senior corporate trader at Bank of Boston. &quot;At the moment, they're a little disillusioned with the American economy.&quot;    Mr. Pugh of Manufacturers Hanover says that in buying Canadian dollars, Japanese investors &quot;figure it's a good play on a diversification basis. And they're right.&quot;    The attraction is interest rates. Last week, the yield on three-month Canadian Treasury bills was 7.53%, in contrast to 5.52% for a similar U.S. investment. Long-term Canadian government bonds yielded 8.90%, in contrast to 7.40% for the U.S. equivalent.    While Canada is closely related economically to the U.S., it doesn't carry all of America's economic risks, traders and analysts say. For example, the inflation that some economists fear will follow a further decline in the U.S. dollar may benefit Canada, some analysts say. They reason that inflation will boost prices of Canada's commodity exports.    With its currency on the mend, Canada also offers less of a foreign-exchange risk than do U.S. investments. That's especially important to the Japanese, who saw the dollar fall 21% against the yen last year and a further 3.6% so far this year.    Japanese holdings of Canadian securities acquired through Japanese investment firms alone grew by an estimated 71% between Jan. 31 and Aug. 31 last year, says Robert A. Brusca, senior vice president and chief economist at Nikko Securities Co. International, New York. The growth was &quot;accelerating sharply as the year progressed,&quot; he notes.    Canada's liberalization of rules governing its securities industry is also cited for attracting foreign investment. Mr. Kudlow of Bear Stearns describes the loosening of restrictions on foreign participation in Canadian financial markets as &quot;sort of a mini-'Big Bang'&quot; that's stimulating outside interest. &quot;Big Bang&quot; is the term used to describe London's financial deregulation last year.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   In Friday's foreign-exchange activity, the U.S. dollar rose as traders covered short, or oversold, positions in the currency. Overall, however, market sentiment remained bearish toward the U.S. unit.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8183 marks, up slightly from 1.8150 Thursday. The dollar climbed to 152.68 yen, from 151.93.    ---                      CURRENCY RATES                         New York    Home Mkt.    New York                           Fri.        Fri.
