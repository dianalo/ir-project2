All of the people who have been storing those back issues ofNational Geographic can throw them out if they can come up with $65for ``Odyssey: The Art of Photography at National Geographic''(Thomasson-Grant). The selections from 100 years of NationalGeographic photography are rich in quality and variety.   Among other retrospectives, John Loengard has assembled ``LifeClassic Photography: A Personal Interpretation'' (New York GraphicSociety, $24.95). Each photograph is accompanied by a succinct,provocative statement on how the shot came to be, giving it atextbook value.   The West is at the top of landscape books with two works from theGraphic Society: ``Ansel Adams: Letter and Images'' ($50), and EliotPorter's ``The West'' ($60). The Adams book is distinguished by thelate photographer's lucid personal reflections on his art, whilePorter's shots stand alone with the luster of oil paintings.   To complete the history lesson, the life and work of a Westernphotography pioneer can be found in ``William Henry Jackson and theTransformation of the American Landscape,'' by Peter B. Hales(Temple University Press, $39.95).   The hit of the Midwest is ``Hometowns: An American Pilgrimage''(Graphic Society, $50). George Tice looks for a connection betweenthree little Midwestern towns and three large figures they produced:James Dean's Fairmount, Ind.; Ronald Reagan's Dixon, Ill.; and MarkTwain's Hannibal, Mo.   ``Wayfarer: A Voice From the Southern Mountains'' (Oxmoor House,$50), is photographer William A. Bake's fourth book on the South.The poet James Dickey spins an interesting but uneven tale toaccompany the photographs.   One of the best features on New England comes from Life magazinelegend Alfred Eisenstaedt, who in ``Eisenstaedt: Martha's Vineyard''(Oxmoor House, $35), lets us in on his personal collection of 50years of photographing his summer place.   From more exotic places come rare glimpses at ``The Honey Huntersof Nepal,'' by Eric Valli (Abrams, $29.95), and ``The Whisper ofStars: A Siberian Journey'' (The Globe Pequot Press, $24.95). Thefirst offers breathtaking shots of the Gurung tribe committing thecliff-hanging robberies that have helped sustain the Himalayanpeople for centuries. In the second, Boston Globe two-time PulitzerPrize-winner Stan Grossfeld captures the warmth and life of analmost mythically forbidding land.   There also are portraits aplenty this year, from the popularstudy of the ruling house of Windsor in ``Cecil Beaton: The RoyalPortraits'' (Simon and Schuster, $35), to Sally Mann's evocativelook at girls on the brink of maturity, ``At Twelve: Portraits ofYoung Women'' (New Images, $25).   At the head of the class is ``Album: The Portraits of DuaneMichals 1958-1988'' (Twelvetrees Press, $55). Michals says he isonly sharing an encounter he had with movie stars and ordinarypeople, that most were strangers to him and therefore his portraitsrevealed ``nothing profound about the subjects or capturedanything.'' But there is an almost palpable self-consciousness _ onthe part of the subjects and the photographer _ that gives theseportraits a special freshness.   ``Nicholas Nixon: Pictures of People'' (Graphic Society, $40),coincides with the Museum of Modern Art's first retrospective on the41-year-old photographer. His use of a large-format camera, not invogue since Walker Evans' Depression-era work, forces some soberingconfrontations with subjects such as the elderly and AIDS victims.   Like Beaton, Patrick Lichfield's royal portraits helped make himone of the few British photographers to work for Vogue. Hisportraits and pictures from a style that emerged from commercialwork are presented in ``Lichfield in Retrospect'' (Salem House, $35).   Jazz lovers will be thrilled with ``Jazz: A VisualRetrospective'' (Billboard Publications, $60). Designer K. Abe hascombed archives for portraits so often revealing because thesubjects, as critic Nat Hentoff says in introducing the 350photographs, ``are less likely than most people to wear masks.''   An insider's look at 50 years of jazz can be found in ``BassLine: The Stories and Photographs of Milt Hinton,'' by Hinton andDavid G. Berger (Temple University Press, $39.95). The great bassplayer also has a remarkable eye.   For cultural significance there may be no more important a bookthan Peter Weiermair's ``The Hidden Image'' (The MIT Press, $45), alook at the evolution of the male nude in photography. But like``Robert Mapplethorpe'' (Graphic Society, $50), whose beautiful workhas long been augmented with sometimes shocking male nudes, the bookwill not be of general appeal.   If one of photography's aims is to draw attention to details wemight otherwise give little notice, there is no more successful bookthan MIT Press' $50 ``Water Towers,'' by Bernd and Hilla Becher. Theeffect can only be realized by leafing through the Bechers'groupings of these often overlooked staples of the industriallandscape.   Among other books of interest, author Stephen King andphotographer f-stop Fitzgerald (his legal name) take a look atgargoyles in ``Nightmares in the Sky'' (Viking Studio Books,$29.95); Ansel Adams and writer John Hersey's talents help makepotent ``Manzanar'' (Times Books, $27.50), a look at one of theJapanese internment camps of World War II; Carl Chiarenza's``Landscapes of the Mind'' (David R. Godine, $40), is studio workfor the most serious artists.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Dec. 19</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
