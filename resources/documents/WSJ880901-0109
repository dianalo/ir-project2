Samoth Capital Corp. said the court-appointed trustee for the financially troubled ministry informed it that Mr. Bakker had submitted an offer &quot;on terms which appear to exceed the Samoth offer.&quot;    Samoth's previously reported offer included a $46 million down payment and 7% interest on the balance, which would be paid after five years.    Samoth said it doesn't intend to enter a &quot;bidding war&quot; for PTL, but also said it might &quot;renew its interest&quot; at a later date. The company didn't elaborate on its plans or Mr. Bakker's offer. Its executives weren't immediately available.    The PTL ministry filed last year for reorganization in a federal bankruptcy court after Mr. Bakker resigned amid allegations of sexual improprieties. </TEXT></DOC>
