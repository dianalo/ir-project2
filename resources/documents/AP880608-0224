(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker said Wednesday that God hasgiven him a plan to save PTL as a Christian retreat, and if theministry is sold for non-religious purposes, it will be cursed.   Bakker said he has started raising money to buy back the $160million televangelical empire he built over 14 years and lost 15months ago after a sex and money scandal. He refused to say howmuch money has been raised.   Asked if he had the resources to buy PTL, he said, ``God does.''   ``God has given us a plan how to pay for it and how to restoreit,'' he told The Associated Press after a brief news conference.``The same God that has given me the vision to build it has givenme a vision to maintain it.''   Bakker did not reveal details of his vision.   Bakker said he would try to buy PTL's 2,300-acre Heritage USAcomplex in Fort Mill piece by piece as it is liquidated inbankruptcy court.   The ministry is as much as $130 million in debt. Areorganization plan calling for the sale of much of PTL's assets isup for final approval by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds onJune 16 in Columbia.   Under the plan, a separate, non-profit corporation calledHeritage Ministries would be formed to run the cable televisionshow and church at Heritage USA. However, even those operationswere threatened as PTL officials said they haven't raised enoughmoney to pay TV affiliates.   George Shinn, owner of the Charlotte, N.C., Knights minor-leaguebaseball team and the new Charlotte Hornets of the NationalBasketball Association, is among those who have expressed interestin buying Heritage USA. Shinn would like to build a baseballstadium there.   Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye, returned to Fort Mill onTuesday from Gatlinburg, Tenn., and set up in an office about amile from Heritage USA.   ``We are prepared to do whatever it takes to restore PTL,''Bakker said Wednesday. ``We are also prepared to wait. If anyonetakes Heritage USA and turns it into anything other than what itwas dedicated, I'm convinced it will be cursed.''   Bakker met Wednesday with supporters in the office, which hadbeen headquarters of the Bring Bakkers Back Club. The meeting endedwith a prayer session in which he read from the Bible.   Then, everyone stood up, reached their arms toward Bakker andbegan talking and chanting. Some appeared to speak in tongues.   Bakker resigned his ministry March 19, 1987, as a story abouthis tryst with former church secretary Jessica Hahn was about tobreak. His successor, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, banished Bakker afterthe Internal Revenue Service said Bakker and his aides divertedmillions of dollars from the ministry.   ``God forgives anyone of sin. We must live in love,'' Bakkersaid.</TEXT></DOC>
