Mutual fund companies say investors are continuing toinvest in stock funds. A total of $3.1 billion poured intostock funds in February, nearly five times the January level,a trade group reported yesterday.</LP><TEXT>   The sales pace has slackened somewhat in recent weeks,several fund companies say. But that doesn't mean investorsare getting any less bullish. The flood of new cash may beslowing to a torrent, but investors are still snapping upsome of the most speculative funds available.   Small-company stock funds, health care specialty funds andtechnology sector funds are all attracting large sums ofmoney. And among bond funds, high-yielding junk-bond fundsare back in favor as yield-hungry money-fund investors huntfor bigger dividend checks.   February's $3.1 billion inflow was the largest since May1990, when stock funds attracted $4.4 billion, according tothe Investment Company Institute. Last month's inflow waswell ahead of the $646 million inflow in January.   (The inflow figures consist of new sales of fund shares,minus redemptions, plus the net result of switches betweenstock funds and other funds in the same fund family.Reinvested dividends are excluded.)   Investors also are flocking back into junk-bond funds,which took in $330 million from investors in February. It wasthe first monthly net inflow since July 1990, and thestrongest inflow since June 1989.   Money continued to pour into fund groups during March.Large mutual fund companies such as Fidelity Investments, T.Rowe Price Associates and Vanguard Group said they are seeingstrong cash inflows into their stock funds this month. Butthey say inflows are lower than in February.   Where is all the money going? It seems the morespeculative the fund, the more popular it is. At T. RowePrice in Baltimore, for instance, the best-selling stockfunds this month include its technology specialty fund andone of its small-company stock funds.   &quot;There's a very, very strong interest in the small-capfunds,&quot; says Michael Hines, a Fidelity marketing vicepresident.   At Denver's Financial Funds, half of all the money goinginto the fund group's stock funds during March has ended upin its health-care specialty fund.   &quot;We're starting to see a significant change in investors'buying patterns,&quot; says Tim Pitts, an executive vice presidentwith New York's Oppenheimer Management Corp. &quot;The small-capstocks are getting a lot of attention.&quot;   Aggressive growth funds such as single-sector funds andsmall-company stock funds typically account for a minorportion of the fund industry's sales. But according to theInvestment Company Institute, aggressive growth funds werethe second best-selling category of stock fund in February,pulling in $806 million. That compares with an inflow intoaggressive growth funds of just $517 million for all of 1990.   Amid the euphoria, some fund investors are taking profits.New England Securities' stock funds still are pulling in moremoney than they are surrendering to departing shareholders.But, says Executive Vice President Henry Schmelzer, &quot;We'reseeing some big redemptions from some of our equity funds.People are taking advantage of what they see as a peak in themarket, and they're bailing out.&quot;   Stock fund managers also appear edgy about the market. InFebruary, the average cash position at stock funds eased to10.6% of assets from 10.7% in January. But that dip was astatistical quirk, caused by a jump in value of the stocksowned by the funds. Cash held by stock funds in Februaryactually rose, to $29.7 billion from January's $27.7 billion.   Bond funds are attracting investors frustrated bydeclining yields elsewhere. &quot;You've got money-market yieldsthat have come down,&quot; notes Fidelity's Mr. Hines. &quot;You've gotcertificates of deposit and Treasury bill yields coming down.People are interested in moving out on the yield curve&quot; intohigher-yielding funds that own bonds with a longer time tomaturity.   Vanguard says money appears to be moving out of its largetaxable-money fund, which yields 6.6%, and into itshigh-yielding junk-bond fund, which yields 12.9%, and itsGovernment National Mortgage Association bond fund, whichyields 8.7%.   Franklin Resources reports a similar pattern, with cashmoving from its money funds into higher-yielding funds suchas its utility stock fund, adjustable-rate mortgage fund andmunicipal bond funds.   &quot;Whenever you see the money market yields go under 6%,you'll always have a move into the longer maturities,&quot; saysGregory Johnson, a Franklin marketing vice president. &quot;Peopleare willing to take more risk.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
