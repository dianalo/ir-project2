Robertson conceded that Vice President George Bush all but hasthe Republican nomination assured for 1988, but said he would runagain in 1992.   ``There is an enterprise the Lord set me on a year or so ago _running for President of the United States,'' Robertson told anestimated crowd of 3,000 people at the Happy Church in south Denver.   ``Out of what seems to be defeat we are laying the foundationfor a great victory for this nation. It may not be in 1988 ... butI am not going to quit,'' Robertson said.   ``That is His plan for me and for this nation.''   The former television evangelist delivered his Easter message asDemocratic presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson prepared to preach toa packed congregation across town at First Baptist Church.   Later, both candidates spoke at Colorado Springs.   Robertson and Jackson spent the weekend in Colorado trying tosolidify support prior to today's caucuses when the two partieswill begin choosing delegates to the upcoming national conventions.Democratic candidate Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis alsocampaigned in Colorado on Saturday.   Robertson has conceded he has virtually no chance of winning butsaid he hopes he can influence the GOP platform that will be drawnup at the national convention in August.   ``I'm just visiting to encourage some of the people here,''Robertson said Sunday. ``I want them to know that I'm doing work onthe caucuses.''   Robertson's remarks on Sunday echoed statements he had madeSaturday while campaigning in Denver. ``I am going to be thechampion of the Christian and conservative points of view ... if ittakes until 1992 to do it,'' he told a rally of about 400 people atthe Sheraton Denver Tech Center.   Robertson, who last year gave up his credentials as a SouthernBaptist ministe and has said he no longer want to be identified asa ``television evangelist,'' spoke to four different congregationsin the Denver area during a three-hour period. His message centeredon the hope of the resurrection as he assured churchgoers his owncampaign is not dead.   ``The cross lost it for Satan and won it for us. I want toencourage all of you today that we are not finished. We are justwarming up,'' he said as churchgoers showed their approval withnods and ``Amens.''   During his appearance at the New Life Baptist Church in ColoradoSprings, Robertson also told more than 1,000 supporters that thenation has a moral and not a governmental problem.   But societal problems continue to grow because governmentagencies assist by giving contraceptives to teen-agers and byproposing that clean needles be given to drug users to help preventthe spread of AIDS he said.</TEXT></DOC>
