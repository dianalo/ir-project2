But Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ruled out a reintroductionof detention without trial to deal without an upsurge of violenceby the outlawed Irish Republican Army in the British province.   British and Irish government officials, meanwhile, met inBelfast today to discuss security in the aftermath of the IRAbombing Wednesday that killed six off-duty soldiers in Lisburn,seven miles southwest of Belfast.   Mrs. Thatcher's top official in he province, Tom King,acknowledged that a security lapse allowed IRA guerrillas to planta bomb on the soldiers' van while they were running in a 13-milecharity half-marathon.   King said the soldiers failed to check the unmarked van forexplosives and should not have left it unattended in a parking lotwhile taking part in the footrace. The bomb exploded in the markettown as the soldiers were returning to their barracks.   The seven pounds of plastic explosives used in the bomb werethought to have been smuggled into the province from Libya, Kingsaid.   Ten civilians, including a 2-year-old boy and an 80-year-oldman, were injured, none seriously, authorities said. The bombingbrought this year's death toll from sectarian violence to 38, eightthis week alone.   Claiming responsibility for the bombing, the IRA vowed to wage``unceasing war'' against the British security forces. Theguerrilla group is fighting to oust Britain from Northern Irelandand unite the Protestant-dominated province with the mainly RomanCatholic Irish Republic.   In Parliament Thursday night, King's deputy, Northern IrelandMinister John Stanley, said the government was giving the RoyalUlster Constabulary, the province's mainly Protestant police force,new power to use genetic fingerprinting to fight terrorism.   Police forces in England and Wales already use the sophisticatedtechnique, which matches DNA extracts found in a suspect's blood,semen, hair or saliva with evidence found at a crime scene.   In England and Wales, police cannot use genetic fingerprintingwithout a suspect's consent, but police in Northern Ireland will beallowed to require suspects to provide saliva samples withoutconsent, Stanley said. Police would take the samples with mouthswabs.   ``In the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland,highlighted once again by the horrific murder of the six soldiersyesterday, it seems to us entirely reasonable and necessary ... togive the police the power to take a mouth swab, if necessary,without a suspect's consent,'' Stanley said.   Earlier Thursday, Mrs. Thatcher called the attack a ``terribleatrocity.''   But she rejected a lawmaker's proposal to reintroduce the policyof internment without trial used in the 1970s to round up terroristsuspects. Britain abandoned the policy in the face of widespreadcriticism of it as a violation of civil liberties.   Mrs. Thatcher said the possibility of allowing police to detainsuspects without trial was being kept under review, but added: ``Iwould be very, very reluctant to do so.''   The meeting of government officials in Belfast was being heldunder the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, which gave the Irish Republica formal role in running the British province.   It was their first meeting since March, when nine people died intwo weeks of mayhem in Belfast touched off by the shooting deathsof three suspected IRA bombers by British commandos in Gibraltar onMarch 6.   The death toll from Wednesday's bombing was the highest since anIRA bomb killed 11 Protestants attending a war-memorial service inEnniskillen on Nov. 8, 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
