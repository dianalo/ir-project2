The two-day melee in the capital's Mount Pleasant andAdams Morgan neighborhoods brought little directconfrontation between Hispanics, who were protesting theshooting and wounding of a Salvadoran immigrant by a Districtof Columbia police officer, and neighborhood blacks, a numberof whom joined in the looting and bottle throwing.</LP><TEXT>   But Hispanic groups say a major contributing factor in theconflict was continuing ethnic friction between theircommunity and the district's government, which like the cityitself is predominantly black.   Politicians and scholars across the nation say relationsare often strained between the two groups, which frequentlycompete at the bottom of the economic ladder. &quot;If anyoneshould know what the folks in Mount Pleasant are goingthrough, it should be members of the African-Americancommunity,&quot; says Lisa Navarrete, a spokeswoman for theNational Council of La Raza.   The fact that the district's power structure is black --Mayor Sharon Pratt Dixon is black, as is Police Chief IsaacFulwood -- adds to those tensions. In some regards,Washington's situation is almost the mirror image of Miami's,where black residents confront a local power structuredominated by Cuban-Americans.   &quot;The community lashes out against those that are in chargeand who they believe can make a difference,&quot; says Maudine R.Cooper, president of the Washington Urban League. Shedisputes the role of ethnic tensions in the riot, saying theresults here would have been the same &quot;if the mayor and citycouncil had been white or green.&quot;   Among the grievances presented by Hispanic communityleaders to Mayor Dixon is that Hispanic and Spanish-speakingindividuals are inadequately represented in city jobs thatinvolve direct contact with the city's Hispanic population.That population -- which consists largely of Central Americanimmigrants, many of whom don't speak English -- makes up 5%of the district's population, according to the 1990 census,but only 1% of the local-government work force. Hispanicleaders have also been complaining that the top job in thecity's Office of Latino Affairs has been vacant for a year.   In response to these complaints, Mayor Dixon this weekestablished a &quot;multicultural task force&quot; to examine problemsin the district's Hispanic community, and has pledged toincrease cross-cultural training for all district policeofficers. And Rita Soler Ossolinski, the acting director ofthe Latino Affairs office, says a permanent director will beappointed &quot;imminently.&quot;   Competition between ethnic groups at the bottom of theeconomic ladder is nothing new. Earlier in this century,Irish, Italian and East European immigrants jostled for turf,jobs and patronage among big-city tenements. More recently,blacks and Hispanics have clashed over access to city jobs inMiami and Chicago.   In Chicago, Hispanics complained that the administrationof Harold Washington, the city's first black mayor, didn'thire sufficient numbers of Hispanic workers. Today, underMayor Richard Daley Jr., many blacks complain they are losingout to Hispanics in city jobs.   In Washington, the issue of city employment is complicatedby the fact that a large proportion of the city's Hispanicsaren't U.S. citizens. But tensions also run high in theprivate sector, where blacks and Hispanics, in Washington aselsewhere, vie for low-wage jobs in a recession.   &quot;Competition is brutal and tragic at the bottom end of theeconomic spectrum,&quot; says Roger Wilkins, a professor ofhistory at George Mason University and a veteran of thecivil-rights movement. &quot;When you have communities whichsuffer high unemployment, low wages when employed, and largerskills deficits than the white community -- and you have arecession -- things are bound to be difficult and tense.&quot;   Although Washington's Hispanic community is small comparedwith that of other cities, the capital, like the nation as awhole, saw a rapid increase in its Hispanic population duringthe past decade. The Census Bureau says the city's Hispanicpopulation nearly doubled between 1980 and 1990. Because manyof these immigrants came illegally, principally from ElSalvador, the city's Hispanic leaders believe the official 5%figure is too low.   In the past, illegal immigrants have often found work asdishwashers and busboys in hotels and restaurants. But the1986 immigration law cracked down on employers who hiredillegal immigrants, causing many of these jobs to dry up;some Hispanic groups allege the enforcement has beenparticularly fierce in Washington because the Immigration andNaturalization Service is based here. Salvadoran refugees gotsome relief when President Bush last year signed a lawgranting them 18-month visas. Meanwhile, many of Washington'sCentral Americans found jobs in construction -- until therecession put them out of work again.   Construction jobs are a particular point of contentionbetween blacks and Hispanics. &quot;There's an informalapprenticeship process working,&quot; says James Johnson, directorof the Center for Urban Policy at the University ofCalifornia at Los Angeles. &quot;Employers actually identify oneor more Hispanics who in turn do the hiring through theseinformal networks.&quot; Mr. Johnson contends that many whiteemployers prefer a Hispanic buddy system to a black onebecause of pervasive prejudice against low-income blacks. Asa result, he says, blacks feel a sense of &quot;competition andanger.&quot;   Mr. Wilkins says that for years there's been a feelingamong blacks that &quot;black workers in unskilled positionsusually lose out to new immigrants.&quot; But he hastens to add,&quot;I don't have access to the other side of the story.&quot;   Hispanic immigrants complain that they are often exploitedon construction jobs because employers can threaten to reportthem to immigration authorities -- a threat that can't bemade against their non-Hispanic co-workers.&quot;African-Americans who work in the same industries haverights, and they know what their rights are,&quot; says BenitoDiaz, a Hispanic community organizer in Washington.Hispanics, he says, don't.   Local officials and residents here hope that this week'sturmoil is under control, but many believe the underlyingfriction will continue. &quot;Anywhere where there are two racesrubbing together every day, there are bound to be tensionswhere there's a lack of understanding,&quot; says Elaine Grant,executive director of the Woodrow Wilson InternationalCenter, a nonprofit organization providing social services tothe Hispanic community. &quot;And there's a lack of understandinghere from the top down.&quot;   With the riots and the new attention Mayor Dixon isfocusing on the problem, that may be changing. &quot;If there isfollow-through, hopefully it will be adequate, and hopefullyit will be very, very soon,&quot; says Ms. Grant. &quot;Or it's goingto be an incredibly long summer.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
