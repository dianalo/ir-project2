Galler might since he had a handwith many others in the maintenance of the system.andP;  Of course, I had littlereason to know the value since I had taken Professor Galler's introductoryprogramming course; and my programs were (and still are) well-advised intheir branches and process only well-defined variables.andM;Charles R. Crawford 39 MacPherson Avenue Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5R 1W7andM;E-mail vs.andP;  FaxandM;John McCarthy's Viewpoint on the harmful effects of networks on e-mail(December 1989 Communications, pp.andP;  1389-40), and the reply &quot;E-Mail Ham&quot; byDave Goforth (March 1990 Communications, p. 263), raise some issues thatmight merit a more comprehensive discussion.andM;McCarthy notes that fax technology is flourishing, while network e-maillanguishes.andP;  Goforth ascribes this phenomenon to the fact that fax usespoint-to-point network connections, while e-mail does not.andM;However, the relative popularity of fax (in the U.S.A.) with respect toe-mail might be better explained by the widespread adoption of internationalstandards for fax, in contrast to the existing proliferation of proprietarye-mail systems.andP;  This observation was made, albeit implicitly, in McCarthy'sarticle.andM;Fax and e-mail differ in several ways.andP;  Some of the key points can besummarized as follows:andM;Fax is:andM;(a) point-to-pointandM;(b) based on international standardsandM;(c) capable of transmitting graphicsandM;Network e-mail as widely implemented today is:andM;(e) store-and-forwardandM;(f) based on proprietary protocolsandM;(g) not capable of transmitting graphicsandM;Point (c), graphics capability, was mentioned in passing by McCarthy andlikely explains why fax has almost completely replaced (in the U.S.A.) telex,the older commonly used point-to-point communication protocol for writtenmessages.andM;The store-and-forward functions of network e-mail allow users to sendmessages in a &quot;fire and forget&quot; mode, even if the recipient is not on-line,since the network service will buffer the message and deliver it when therecipient comes back on-line.andP;  The network service will also accept adistribution list and optimize transmission of a message (for example, if anoriginator in New York specifies 10 recipients in California, the networkcould transmit a single copy of the message and its distribution list fromNew York to California and duplicate the message 10 times only once itreaches California).andP;  Distribution list handling and the associated savingsin transmission costs are significant benefits for users of store-and-forwardnetworks.andM;The main advantage of point-to-point network connections, as compared tostore-and-forward, is the guarantee of immediate delivery.andP;  This guaranteehas a price: the originator has to wait until the recipient is on-line andready to receive (i.e., not busy receiving another message).andM;McCarthy characterizes the industry that provides store-and-forward servicesas &quot;substantially useless and actually harmful.&quot;andP;  He is certainly entitled tohis own opinion, as well all are.andP;  It should be noted, however, that usersappear to desire the features of store-and-forward network connections, ascan be seen by the proliferation of devices that add crude store-and-forwardfeatures to point-to-point communications protocols.andP;  As examples, considertelephone answering machines, repeat-dialing capabilities in fax machines,and multiple-recipient features in fax machines.andM;Within my own company, Hewlett-Packard, essentially all employees haveconvenient access to both fax and internal e-mail (HPDesk).andP;  Fax tends to beused only when guaranteed immediate delivery is essential.andP;  E-mail is usedfor the overwhelming majority of intra-company written communicationprecisely because users like the co venience of being able to submit amessage to a reliable network, which will ensure delivery even if therecipient happens to be off-line at the moment the message is submitted.andO;Graphs can be transmitted within HPDesk.andM;Inter-company (as opposed to intra-company) use of e-mail has certainly beenstymied by point (f), reliance on proprietary protocols.andM;While international standards for e-mail have been available since 1984 (theCCITT X.400 series of recommendations), they have not yet been widelyadopted, for a number of reasons.andP;  This situation is now changing.andP;  Mostmajor e-mail networks and most major vendors of proprietary e-mail softwarenow offer reasonably priced, reliable, good-performance X.400 interconnectoptions.andP;  Most European PTTs offer X.400 e-mail to fax conversion, thusallowing e-mail users to use store-and-forward protocols to send messages torecipients equipped only with fax machines.andM;Many companies, including my own, are already connected on a pilot basis toother companies using the X.400 protocols.andP;  I am personally expecting to beable to use X.400 links to reach a significant number of my non-HPcorrespondents by the end of 1990.andM;Within the next few years, use of X.400 should become widespread, thusallowing the same proliferation of interconnectivity that has been one of thereasons for the success of fax.andM;PC-based implementations of X.400 are already available from several vendorsand will drop in price as the use of X.400 protocols fore-mailinterconnection increases.andP;  It is my belief that in the near future we willsee a proliferation of PCs that exchange messages using the X.400 protocols.andO;Furthermore, graphics capability will be available in X.400 implementationsin the future, thus obviating point (g) above.andM;This is not to say that e-mail will replace fax.andP;  Point-to-point operation isclearly desirable in many cases and will continue to be used.andP;  Butstore-and-forward operation is also desirable in other cases and can beprovided when international standards for e-mail are widely programmed.andM;Richard Hill Hewlett-Packard-- Middle East Operations Route du Nant-d'Avril150 P.O. Box CH-1217, Meyrin 2 Geneva, SwitzerlandandM;Better Late Than NeverandM;I have been meaning to respond to Brian Kocher's article on certification,which originally appeared as a President's Letter in the June 1989 issue ofCommunications (pp.andP;  660-662), and I apologize for the belatedness of theresponse.andM;I feel very strongly that regulation is needed, since in this wonderfultechnological age computers are being used everywhere for applications thathave the possibility of endangering the safety and life of people.andP;  Not onlydoes this concern the real-time use of computers (in manufacturing plants, inthe medical profession, etc.) but also in the design of buildings, airplanes,and other items used by us in everday life.andP;  If the design is faulty becauseof faulty computer programs, then that product is potentially a killer.andM;I believe that accreditation should be offered in at least these areas:andM;Real-time ProgrammingandM;On-Line andamp; Batch ProgrammingandM;System Requirements andamp; analysisandM;System DesignandM;Quality AssuranceandM;I believe that accreditation should involve three parts:andM;Part1: Subject area knowledge test.andM;Example: programming would have questions on (1) programming techniques(scope of control, scope of effect, modularity, cohesiveness), (2) debuggingtechniques, (3) unit-testing techniques.andM;Part 2: Subject area performance test.andM;The applicant would actually perform the skills being tested; for example,the test on programming would require that code be written (which would thenbe evaluated according to set criteria: use of structured techniques,correctness, error-handling, etc.).andP;  Possibly some erroneous code could bepresented, with the applicant having to analyze what problems exist.andM;Part 3: Peer review.andM;Similar to what Certified Management Consultants now endure, a panel of peerswould ask questions of the applicant to ascertain &quot;competence.&quot;andM;Passing for each part would be 85 percent, and there would be requirementsfor continued education and for adhering to a stringent code of ethics.andM;If assuring that a company's books are audited correctly is important enoughto be regulated (the CPA designation), then we should require nothing lessfor computer professionals who often produce systems with possiblylife-threatening impact.andM;Whatever form regulation takes, it needs to (1) be fair and impartial and (2)be comprehensive, to ensure competence.andM;These are my thoughts (prejudices?) on this often emotional subject.andM;In closing, I want to offer my help in achieving regulation.andP;  Like mostworthwhile goals, it will require a tremendous amount of work.andM;Noel K. Lytle Lytle and Associates, Inc. P.O. Box 767336 Atlanta, GA30076-7336andM;Standards and HDTVandM;&quot;HDTV and the Computer Industry,&quot; in the November 1989 Communications (pp.andO;1301-12), contained one inaccuracy in the account of the SIGGRAPH '89 HDTVpanel.andP;  The issue of nonsquare pixels was indeed raised and discussed asdescribed, but I, not Glenn Reitmeier, responded to the &quot;square pixels anon-issue&quot; remark and provided the &quot;newspaper page&quot; example.andP;  The aspectratio distortion that I cited was eight percent (four percent plus fourpercent, assuming a font rendered for landscape and used on a portrait page)not 44 percent as reported.andP;  I believe that Reitmeier did, as reported,explain the origin of the nonsquare-pixel standard and challenge the panel toaddress both square pixels and progressive scan.andP;  The article as it standsimplies that Reitmeier made an unjustifiable criticism of the Japanesestandard, while mentioning that his institution (the Sarnoff Research Center)received a DARPA grant to work on American HDTV, thus casting doubt on hiscredibility.andP;  It furthermore gives the false impression that criticism of thebroadcast-industry-generated standard was confined to those parties directlyinterested in developing HDTV standards, thus casting doubt on the sincerityof those who challenged the panel's assumptions and coloring it as if it werea simple case of not invented here.andP;  On the contrary, the speakers whochallenged the panel on these issues were knowledgeable, citing specificconcerns arising in many kinds of applications, and they were heavilyapplauded by the SIGGRAPH audience--a very diverse group dominated by usersand designers interested in results, not standards quibbles.andP;  Clearly a notof people saw the problems with HDTV.andP;  With nonsquare pixels, no progressivescan, no option for a 2:1 screen aspect ratio (for compatibility with filmand stereographics), etc., it seems to have poor potential to become aforward-looking computer display standard.andP;  If the broadcast industry expectsthe computer industry to pave the way towards economies of scale for HDTV, itwill have to meet some of these expectations.andM;This was a minor error in an otherwise excellent article.andP;  Karen Frenkel dida very complete job of enumerating the complex technical issues and equallycomplex politics involved in standardizing HDTV, and I thank her for it.andM;Craig Hubley Craig Hubley andamp; Assoc.andP;  700 Spadina Avenue Toronto, Ontario,Canada M5S 2J2andM;Smaller and SmallerandM;The letters in the ACM Forum in April 1990 Communications, concerningNathaniel Borensteins's letter of February, underscore the problem ofproofreading that column.andP;  The P.S.andP;  of Guy Steele refers to an errorinvolving &quot;[10.sup.600]&quot; in his mail letter, but in fact, this notation neverappeared.andP;  Instead, it was printed as &quot;10,600.&quot;andP;  This is the same sort oferror as Morton Kaplon described, so, in spite of the footnore, I suspectthat the error occurred in formating the exponent.andM;I believe that at the minimum such letters should be proofread by someone inthe ACM office capable of the understanding their content.andP;  A better solutionwould be to give the authors galley proofs to proofread themselves [sic].andP;  Iwas impressed when the British journal Nature returned galleys of a shortletter to me before it was published.andP;  Although this may delay publication ofcertain borderline letters by one month, it would help solve the typoproblem.andP;  If you publish this letter, please follow one of these procedures,so the comedy of error does not continue.andM;Nelson L. Max Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory P.O. Box 808 Livermore,CA 94550andM;With humble apologies to the readers, yes, the notation should have read as[10.sup.600] instead of 10,600.andP;  To help clear up other matters, however,readers who are following this correspondence may wish to consider thefollowing.andP;  Kaplon's letter may have been somewhat hastily written, in thathe seems to have missed the point that Borenstein was criticizing informationpresented in a Newstrack item, which reported the discovery of a new primenumber.andP;  Based on the informatio provided in the item, Borenstein calculatedthat &quot;there are fewer than 109 atoms,&quot; but he then goes on to say that &quot;I amfairly certain that the universe with which I am familiar with is somewhatlarger&quot; (sarcasm intended).andP;  Hence, he meant &quot;109&quot; and not [10.sup.9], asKaplon suggests, and no typo occurred, as both Kaplon and Max suggest.andP;  Ergo,the statement &quot;this is the same sort of error as Morton Kaplon Described&quot; isinaccurate.--G.C.andM;Concerning the 1989andM;Turing AwardandM;In a news item announcing William M. Kahan as the recipient of the 1989 A.M.andO;Turing Award (ACM News, January 1990, p. 89), it is stated the &quot;Kahan wascited for his drive not only to solve a problem [floating-point computation]but to see the solutions adopted,&quot; referring to his &quot;spearheading the effortto develop and adopt IEEE Standards 754 and 854 for binary andradix-independent floating-point numbers.&quot;andM;I have questions concerning the idea that a contribution to standardizationno matter how major represents the sort of research for which the Turi gaward is intended.andP;  In addition, even if standardization contributions areacceptable, the IEEE floating-point standardz is, I believe, a scientific andtechnical mistake in the sense that it hinders growth in mathematicalalgorithms in order to help protect non-experts from errors.andP;  The reason thestandard has not been more widely criticized is that it is of minor pote tialnegative consequence, compared to the government-mandated Ada programminglanguage and VHDL hardware description standards (see my paper &quot;CAD ToolInterchangeability through Net List Translation,&quot; to appear in SIGDANewsletter, June 1990).andM;I also have a reservation of another kind in this case, although it is basedon considerations other than the value of technical research.andP;  During mygraduate studies at UC Berkeley, I witnessed two kinds of unfair treatment ofstudents that are not of the high caliber that should be required of a Turingaward winner.andP;  Many undergraduate computer science majors receivedconsistently high grades with the exception of a data structure orprogramming class taught by professor Kahan.andP;  This was viewed at the time asrepresenting unfair treatment of undergraduates by Professor Kahan, and Ibelieve he has ceased teaching undergraduate classes.andM;I, personally, in addition to four or five other graduate students (two arenow Professors at Waterloo), had difficulty passing our preliminaryexaminations in the old Berkeley CS departme t in 1972 because of ProfessorKahan.andP;  Each of us had passed five out of the six written examinations undera system that allowed examinations to be retaken.andP;  We were all repeatedlyfailing the numerical analysis examination graded only by Professor Kahansince the other professor in the area was on sabbatical.andP;  In my case,Professor Kahan stated in a critique that I would never pass.andP;  I believe thereason was that he disagreed with my view of numerical analysis, but myviewpoint, which was believed a d taught by Stanford's physicists anddifferential equation specialists in the late 1960s, posits that the numberof computations is more important than arithmetic accuracy and that answersmust be evaluated with common sense.andP;  Eventually, we were all told to retakethe examination and everyone passed.andM;Steve Meyer Pragmatic C Software 220 Montgomery Street, Suite 925 SanFrancisco, CA 94104</TEXT></DOC>
