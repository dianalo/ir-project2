But the United States is widely expected to make an issue of itsallegations that Libya has built a large chemical weapons plant.   The conference, opening Saturday, follows the downing of twoLibyan jet fighters by U.S. Navy planes on Wednesday.   The conference also may become a forum for disputes between Iranand Iraq, following Iraq's use of chemical weapons in the eight-yearPersian Gulf war. Iraq said it used chemical weapons after Iran did,but Iran has denied using them.   Speaking at a news conference, Dumas said France hopes thefive-day conference ``will not deviate from its agenda'' after theincident. He also said the meeting should avoid reviewing pastchemical weapons deployment.   ``The Paris conference must not judge past acts,'' Dumas said.   The aim of the conference is to reaffirm the 1925 Geneva Protocolbanning the use of chemical weapons and give impetus to negotiationsin Geneva on a universal ban on use and production of chemical arms.   Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general, will attendthe conference, U.N. officials said.   William Burns, the U.S. arms control director, told reporters inWashington on Wednesday that the American delegation will focus ontrying to strengthen the secretary-general's authority toinvestigate allegations of chemical weapons use and authorize theU.N. General Assembly or Security Council to impose sanctions.   But Burns said this could be difficult since all actions at theconference will be taken by consensus. This means a singleparticipant, such as Libya, could hold off an overwhelming majority.   The U.S. government accuses Libya of having built a chemicalweapons plant in the desert town of Rabta, 35 miles south of itscapital, Tripoli. President Reagan last month said a military strikeon the plant was under consideration.   Libya says the plant in question produces pharmaceuticals.   West German radio quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying the WestGerman ambassador in Tripoli met Wednesday with Libyan leader Col.Moammar Gadhafi to discuss ways for an international commission toinspect the Rabta plant.   U.S. officials have said they suspect that a West German companyhelped build the chemical plant.   Hans-Dietrich Genscher, West Germany's foreign minister, toldreporters in Bonn before the attack that his government wasinvestigating the firm Imhausen-Chemie, but that it had noindependent verification of the U.S. claims that it supplied Libyawith materials for the plant.   Britain's Foreign Office said Wednesday night it had independentinformation confirming the plant was built to produce chemicalweapons. It was Britain's first comment on the U.S. allegations.   On Wednesday, two American F-14s shot down two Libyan jetfighters. U.S. government officials said the Navy jets wereconducting routine operations and had been threatened.   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci denied the action wasrelated to the earlier accusation concerning the chemical weaponsplant.   Dumas said it was too soon for all the facts on the air skirmishto be known and that France awaited the ``Libyan version'' of theevents.   Dumas said France did not have enough information to decidewhether the Libyan plant was capable of producing chemical weapons.   The conference was formally proposed by President Reagan duringhis September address to the U.N. General Assembly.</TEXT></DOC>
