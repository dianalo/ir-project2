Oat bran has become ``a buzz word,'' says Agriculture Departmentnutritionist Ruth H. Matthews. ``Everybody's got to have oat bran.You've got to have oat bran in this and that. I've seen potatochips with oat bran, and popcorn and everything else.''   U.S. oats production rebounded this year from a drought-level1988 output of 219 million bushels _ the lowest since theAgriculture Department began records in 1866 _ to 371 millionbushels this year.   But that won't be enough, and the United States will wind up in1989-90 importing around 55 million bushels of oats. Last year,when drought shriveled yields, imports jumped to 68 million bushels.   Even before the current craze, the United States was importingoats from Canada, Sweden, Finland and Argentina. Now the demand isgreater than ever.   It was only a few years ago that medical researchers foundhealth benefits in foods rich in fiber. Combined with a reductionin the consumption of fats, they can help guard against coloncancers and high levels levels of serum cholesterol.   Oats, long-recognized as a nutritious food, gained furtherdietary fame as researchers found that certain kinds of fiber _those that are soluble in water _ are even more effective.   ``If you cook oatmeal in a pan, you know how sticky it is andhow difficult it is to clean,'' Mrs. Matthews said. ``Well, thatsticky product is the soluble fiber.''   Oat bran, which is extracted from the oat seed, is even moreconcentrated in fiber content.   When farms were powered mostly by horses and mules _ a record of25 million in the U.S. inventory in the early 1920s _ farmers grewmore than 40 million acres of oats each year.   As recently as 1954, oats were harvested from 40.6 millionacres. But by the mid-1960s the crop was down to less than 20million acres, and in the late 1970s dropped to below 10 million.   Last year's drought cut the harvest to 5.6 million acres. Thisyear's harvest rose to more than 6.8 million acres, primarily aresult of improved weather in some key areas and relatively highmarket prices.   A major reason for the slide in oats production, however, hasbeen the federal crop program that makes barley and other grainsmore profitable to produce.   Oats are grown in most states but are concentrated in the NorthCentral region, including the Dakotas, Minnesota, Iowa and Nebraska.   Since 1982, according to USDA economists Linwood A. Hoffman andMark Ash, government programs ``have created a competitivedisadvantage for oats'' by assigning a common acreage base to oatsand barley.   Under the price support apparatus, farmers simply had a betterfinancial deal with barley instead of oats.   Finally, Hoffman and Ash say in a recent analysis, Congress in1985 set up the Conservation Reserve Program so that farmers couldtake erosion-prone land from crop production for 10 years.   ``In many instances, this land was planted to oats prior toentry into the program,'' they said.   Oats is not a kingpin crop in the United States when comparedwith some others. In pre-drought 1987, for example, the value ofoats production ranked 16th among major U.S. field crops at $606million. By comparison, corn was $14 billion; soybeans, $11.3billion; hay, $9 billion; and wheat, $5.5 billion.   Despite the growth in supermarket products, oats is stillbasically a livestock feed grain, with only the higher-qualityportion going to food processors. About 300 million bushels areexpected to be used as feed in 1989-90, compared with around 110million bushels as food and seed.   Pete Riley of the USDA Economic Research Service said oatsprices averaged about $1.52 a bushel in the first five months ofthe crop's current marketing year, which began June 1.   The average for the full 1988-89 marketing year was $2.61 abushel, up from $1.56 in 1987-88, reflecting the drought-yearmarket bulge.   Congress is putting together new legislation to replace the 1985farm law that expires next year. One of the items under review isthe oats program and how more U.S. production can be encouraged.   David L. Senter, national director of the American AgriculturalMovement, said the best way to avoid importing more oats ``is justto improve the program so that farmers can economically afford togrow 'em'' again.   Senter said that when the current farm law was designed in 1985there was virtually no concern about oats. Lawmakers, he said,``got caught up in writing programs'' for other crops and oatsproduction ``did not receive the attention it should have.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday AMs, Nov. 13</NOTE></DOC>
