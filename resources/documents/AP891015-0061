The powerful storm sent a wall of water washing over the island,and some called it the worst natural disaster in U.S. history.   The death toll from that storm isn't certain, but expertsgenerally agree it easily topped 6,000. Some accounts placed thenumber of people killed at 8,000.   The storm caused damage estimated at $30 million and $40 million.   Fifteen years later, in August, another hurricane hit Galveston.The official death toll was estimated at 275, much lower than thegreat 1900 storm.   That's because storm-wary residents had raised the grade of theisland and built a seawall to protect them from surging tidesblamed for most of the deaths. Still, damage from the 1915 stormwas set at $50 million.</TEXT></DOC>
