The rule amendsmarine mammal regulations regarding the importation of yellowfin tuna fromnations with purse seine vessels fishing in the eastern tropical PacificOcean (ETP) and for the first time covers intermediary nations, which arenations that may or may not fish in the ETP but import yellowfin tuna andsubsequently offer tuna or tuna products for importation into the UnitedStates.Under this rule, any nation that has purse seine vessels in the ETP andthat wishes to have yellowfin tuna it harvests imported into the UnitedStates must satisfy two categories of requirements by providing documentaryevidence that: (1) The nation has adopted a regulatory program governingthe incidental taking of marine mammals in the fishery that is comparableto the program of the United States, and (2) the average rate of incidentalmortality of marine mammals in the fishery by its vessels is comparableto the rate of incidental mortality of marine mammals from fishing by theU.S. fleet as specified in the 1988 amendments. The rule also generallyrequires that any intermediary nation which wants to export yellowfin tunaand tuna products to the United States must ban the importation of yellowfintuna and tuna products from any nation that is prohibited from exportingdirectly to the United States.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>Dates:</T2> This rule is effective March 7, 1989.

As a result of comments received on the interim final rule,modifications and clarifications have been made to the rule. In addition,on November 23, 1988, the President signed into law the Marine Mammal ProtectionAct Amendments of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-711) which contains several specificinstructions relating to regulation of tuna imports. This amendment broadenedconsiderably the scope of persons affected by the import rule. Particularly,persons in nations that are defined as ``intermediary nations'' in thisrule were not as significantly affected by the interim final rule publishedin March 1988. In order to provide an opportunity to comment on these regulations,this interim final rule has a 60-day comment period.Additional background information is available in the preamble to the interimfinal regulations published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 18, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">MMPA Amendments of 1988</ITAG>Many of the changes made by the 1988 amendments directly address requirementsfor nations wishing to have yellowfin tuna or tuna products imported intothe United States. Other changes are directed toward the domestic tunapurse seine fishing industry and affect this import rule because foreignharvesting nations must have marine mammal protection measures that arecomparable to those of the United States.These regulations require, implementing the 1988 amendments, that by thebeginning of the 1990 fishing season, a harvesting nation must have thesame prohibitions on purse seine sets on pure schools of species of marinemammals, conducting sundown sets, and on other activities that are madeapplicable to U.S.-flag vessels by the 1988 amendments in order to havea program comparable to the United States. The sundown set prohibitionmust provide that sets must be completed through backdown to rolling thenet to sack-up within one-half hour after sundown (an operator who consistentlyhas had and continues to have an average mortality rate in observed sundownsets that is no greater than the average of the fleet in daylight setsmay be exempted from this prohibition.) Two other new marine mammal protectionmeasures and prohibitions a foreign nation must adopt for the purposesof comparability by the beginning of 1990 are: (1) A prohibition on theuse of explosives, other than explosives equivalent to U.S. Departmentof Transportation rated Class C agricultural pest control devices; and(2) a system to identify, provide remedial training, and remove from thefishery operators whose mortality rate is consistently and substantiallyabove the majority of the fleet.In regard to observer coverage, these regulations require that fishingby the nation's tuna fishing fleet of purse seine vessels of greater than400 tons carrying capacity, including all certified charter vessels operatingunder its laws, must be monitored by observers of the Inter-American TropicalTuna Commission (IATTC) or another international observer program in whichthe United States participates. The sampling level achieved by that observerprogram must be equal to that achieved for the U.S. fleet for the sameperiod, unless the Secretary of Commerce finds that an alternative observerprogram will provide a reliable estimate of the mortality rate of the nation'sfleet. Further, a harvesting nation's fleet incidental mammal mortalityrate to be comparable must not exceed twice that of the U.S. fleet forthe same period by the end of 1989 and must not exceed 1.25 times thatof the U.S. fleet for the same period by the end of 1990 and for subsequentyears. In addition, the number of eastern spinner dolphin (<T3>Stenella longirostris</T3>) and coastal spotted dolphin (<T3>Stenella attenuata</T3>) incidentally killed by the nation's fleetcannot exceed 15 percent and 2 percent, respectively, of the nation's totalmarine mammal mortality during 1989 and for any subsequent fishing year.To provide a reasonable time period for a nation to respond to future changesin the U.S. program, these regulations provide that any new prohibitionsor marine mammal protection measures adopted in the future by the UnitedStates for its vessels must be substantially adopted and implemented withinsix months of the U.S. implementation to avoid a finding that a programis no longer comparable to that of the United States. Failure of a harvestingnation to satisfy any of these conditions will result in a negative findingand a ban on the importation of its yellowfin tuna into the United States.A substantial change from the interim final rule published in March 1988is that these regulations apply to intermediary nations as mandated bythe 1988 amendments. Except as noted below, any nation from which yellowfintuna or tuna products will be imported into the United States must certifythat it has acted to ban importation of yellowfin tuna and tuna productsfrom any nation which is banned from directly importing them into the UnitedStates. The intermediary nation must implement its ban no later than 60days after the United States bans such imports. These regulations providethat failure of an intermediary nation to certify within 90 days of theU.S. ban that it has implemented its ban will result in the United Statesprohibiting entry of all yellowfin tuna and tuna products from the intermediarynation. However, a nation which the Secretary determines does not obtainany part of its tuna supply from embargoed nations, will not be requiredto certify that it has banned imports from the embargoed nation or nations.Another substantial change required by the 1988 amendments is that shoulda ban on imports of yellowfin tuna and tuna products from either a harvestingor intermediary nation under these regulations persist for six months,NOAA must certify that fact to the President. That certification will bedeemed to be a certification under section 8(a) of the Fishermen's ProtectiveAct of 1967 (22 U.S.C. 1978(a)). The ultimate effect of such a certificationcould be a ban on importation of all fish products from the subject nationinto the United States. The ban would remain in effect so long as the banon yellowfin tuna and tuna products persists under these regulations.<ITAG tagnum="85">Comments on the Original Interim Final Rule and Responses</ITAG>Seven comments were received on the original interim final rule. Letterswere received from conservation organizations, a segment of the tuna fishingindustry, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, and the Marine MammalCommission. A summary of the comments received and the NMFS responses tothese comments are as follows.1. Comment: Several commenters expressed concern that the phase-in periodin the regulations was longer than necessary and should be reduced to requirethat the kill rates of other nations be immediately comparable with theU.S. rate.<T3>Response:</T3> The MMPA Amendments of 1988 established specific standardsof mortality rate comparability. By the end of 1989, nations must havean average annual mortality rate no greater than twice that of the U.S.fleet average for the same period and by the end of 1990, their mortalityrates can be no greater than 1.25 times that of the U.S. fleet for thesame period. This rule implements those standards.2. Comment: Several commenters indicated that the collection of kill andserious injury data and data on other forms of incidental take, includingharassment and encirclement, should be required for individual species.<T3>Response:</T3> The NMFS has modified the regulations to require thecollection of kill and serious injury data for individual stocks but decidednot to include harassment and encirclement data. As noted in the responsesto comments in the March 1988 interim final regulations and in the responseto comment 4 here, NMFS has chosen the rate of kill as the standard forthe rate comparison test, and not other types of ``takings'' like chase,encirclement, or capture because ``kill'' is the most meaningful standardestablished by regulations that can be monitored and measured with thegreatest accuracy. Marine mammal mortality is the ``take'' standard bywhich the U.S. tuna fleet is regulated under the quota system in effectunder the MMPA.3. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several comments were received indicating that the observersample size should be greater than the 33 percent required.<T3>Response:</T3> The MMPA amendments of 1988 require that the foreignharvesting nations' marine mammal mortality be monitored by observers fromthe IATTC or another international program in which the United States participates.That observer program must achieve a sample rate equal to that achievedby the United States for the same period, unless the Secretary of Commercedetermines that an alternate observer program will provide a sufficientlyreliable estimate of the nation's mortality rate. That determination mustbe published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> no less than sixty days before an alternate observerprogram can be accepted as meeting this requirement.4. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters indicated that kill-per-set should beused as a performance standard.<T3>Response:</T3> The NMFS still finds that kill-per-ton is the best singlerate to use in the comparability test implemented in these regulations.Of the three performance standards evaluated by NMFS, kill-per-day, kill-per-ton,and kill-per-set, kill-per-set is the most variable because of the wayoccasional problem sets (kill-per-set andgreater; 15 animals) affect theestimate of variance.5. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters recommended that participation in theIATTC observer program should be mandatory.<T3>Response:</T3> The NMFS continues to support the IATTC observer programas it is the only international porpoise research and observer programat the present time. This does not preclude, however, recognition of analternate program proposed by any nation or regional body which will meetthe requirements under the MMPA as amended in 1988. The Assistant Administratorwill review any proposed alternate observer program to ascertain whetherthe observer training qualifications and requirements, methods of assigningobservers to vessels, and the statistical reliability and accuracy of thedata collected can serve as an acceptable basis for making mortality estimates.This review also could include an on-site review of the nation's porpoiseprotection program. The Assistant Administrator's proposed determinationwill be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> at least 60 days before implementation.6. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that the terms ``consistently''and ``drastically'' should be defined in relation to comparability of achieving33 percent coverage in foreign observer programs.<T3>Response:</T3> The MMPA Amendments of 1988 have resulted in a modificationof this portion of the rule. The basic observer coverage required is atleast the same as achieved by the United States for the same period. Anyexception from this requirement will require notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> at least 60 days before final action is taken,as explained in response five.7. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters questioned the basis for allowing theforeign kill rates to be 25 percent and 75 percent higher than the UnitedStates.<T3>Response:</T3> This provision was eliminated to comply with the MMPAAmendments of 1988. Accordingly, all nations will be required to maintaina kill-per-ton rate within 25 percent of the U.S. rate by the end of 1990,regardless of the number of vessels in their fishing fleet.8. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that nations be required to submitdata for all years from 1986-1991 and subsequent years and that these databe made publicly available.<T3>Response:</T3> The NMFS has clarified the language to require nationsto submit data for each year any of their vessels fished in the ETP beginningin 1986. Summary data for individual nations will be publicly availableat the time a finding is made if three or more vessels participated inthat nation's fishery. In accordance with NOAA's standard confidentialityprocedures, confidential business information from nations with fewer thanthree vessels in this fishery will not be released to the public. However,the overall kill rate for even the nations with fewer than three vesselswill be made available.9. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter indicated that a finding should be terminatedif a nation does not submit the required documentation by August 16, 1988,or fails to submit a complete annual report by July 31.<T3>Response:</T3> The NMFS agrees and has modified the language in theregulations (see modification 10 on page 19) to clarify this point.10. <T3>Comment: </T3>two commenters suggested that an overall ceiling be placedon the foreign kill rate and also that quotas be established for individualstocks and the aggregate kill of porpoise using current kill rates andannual net recruitment rates.<T3>Response:</T3> The NMFS review of the 1984 and 1988 amendments to theMMPA and their legislative histories finds explicit instructions on variousaspects of comparability, including establishment of a kill rate standard.There is not any indication that foreign quotas are contemplated. Theseregulations establish the kill rate standards and the species/stock limitationsrequired by the 1988 amendments.As required by the 1988 amendments, this rule limits the percentage ofeastern spinner dolphin and coastal spotted dolphin that can be killedby each nation to 15 percent and 2 percent, respectively, of that nation'stotal annual mortality starting in 1989.11. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter pointed out that there did not appear tobe a specific requirement for fish being imported to have been caught whilea finding of comparability was in effect, and that such a requirement shouldbe explicitly included in the regulations.<T3>Response:</T3> Neither the 1984 nor the 1988 amendments provide forsuch a treatment of tuna offered for importation. In order for a nationto receive an affirmative finding, the nations must demonstrate that ithas in place a mammal protection program comparable to that of the UnitedStates and that its purse seine vessels have achieved a mortality ratecomparable to that of the U.S. fleet over the same time period. NMFS believesthat tuna caught during the period when the nation's fleet performancewarranted a finding of comparability should be allowed entry into the UnitedStates.12. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters requested that the Certificate of Originbe modified to indicate the country that actually caught the canned tunabeing imported and the dates that the fish were caught in order to preventthe importation of tuna taken when findings were not valid.<T3>Response:</T3> The NMFS has modified the Certificate of Origin formto require nations exporting yellowfin tuna, both canned and non-canned,to the United States to provide the trip dates for the catch included inthe shipment. This information will allow the U.S. Government to determinethe identity of harvesting nations for tuna that is imported into the UnitedStates from an intermediary nation.13. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that the declaration statementon the Certificate of Origin form be changed to use language containedin 28 U.S.C. 1746(1) for unsworn declarations executed outside the UnitedStates.<T3>Response:</T3> The NMFS reviewed the declaration statement and hasdecided not to modify the language which is patterned after the languageused by the U.S. Customs Service in its declaration statement on documentsaccompanying the Certificate of Origin. 14. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested clarification on the scope ofan embargo on nations without findings.<T3>Response:</T3> The MMPA Amendments of 1988 modified the scope of theimport ban envisioned in the original interim final rule. Consequently,the rule now provides that a nation purse seining for yellowfin tuna inthe ETP (i.e. harvesting nation) without a finding cannot export any yellowfintuna or tuna products to the United States regardless of the ocean areawhere the tuna were caught. Further, if the import ban remains in effectfor six months, the ban may be broadened to include all fishery productsfrom the harvesting nation. Intermediary nations with a history of importingeastern tropical Pacific yellowfin tuna, that desire to export yellowfintuna or tuna products to the United States must certify to the U.S. Governmentthat they have acted within 60 days of the effective date of the U.S. embargoof the harvesting nation to ban imports of yellowfin tuna and tuna productsfrom that nation otherwise their yellowfin tuna and tuna products willalso become subject to an import ban.15. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters indicated that a program should be establishedto verify foreign documentation and that comparable enforcement methods,effectiveness, and levels of penalties should be required.<T3>Response:</T3> The NMFS will review all documentation and other availablesources to verify the enactment of marine mammal laws, regulations, andguidelines and to assess the implementation of effective enforcement programs.An affirmative finding will not be granted unless all of these programareas, including enforcement, are comparable to the United States. However,the specific elements of enforcement programs are not required to be identicalto those of the United States.16. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested an environmental impact statementshould be prepared for the regulations.<T3>Response:</T3> The NMFS has prepared an environmental assessment forthe regulations which is available to the public. The Assistant Administratorhas determined that no significant impact on the human environment, otherthan economic impacts, will occur as a result of these regulations andthat no environmental impact statement will be required. Due to the potentialfor economic impacts, a Regulatory Impact Analysis will be prepared whena final rule is prepared to supersede this interim rule.17. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter indicated that all required documents shouldbe submitted in English, unless there is in-house translating capability.<T3>Response:</T3> The NMFS has concluded that this additional burden onforeign countries is not warranted. The NMFS prefers receiving originallanguage documents and obtaining its own translations, which it is committedto complete in a timely manner.<ITAG tagnum="84">Modifications to the Original Interim Final Rule</ITAG>This interim rule makes the following changes from the original interimrule:1. Modifies the definition of ``ETP Fishing Area 1'' in andSection; 216.3to include an eastward boundary of 86anddegrees; W. longitude which moreaccurately defines the region of differential mortality rate identifiedby IATTC. Other definitions added by the March 18, 1988 interim rule continueto apply unchanged. For ease of reference, those definitions that are notchanged from the previous interim rule are as follow:<ITAG tagnum="21">``ETP'' means the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean which includes thePacific Ocean area bounded by 40anddegrees; N. latitude, 40anddegrees; S. latitude,160anddegrees; W. longitude and the coastlines of North, Central and SouthAmerica. ``ETP Fishing Area 2'' means the offshore area south of 14anddegrees;N. latitude, north of 6anddegrees; N. latitude, east of 150anddegrees; W. longitude,and west of 123anddegrees; W. longitude. ``ETP Fishing Area 3'' means allother areas within the ETP not included in Fishing Areas 1 and 2. ``Harvestingnation'' means the country under whose flag one or more fishing vesselsare documented, or which has by formal declaration agreed to assert jurisdictionover one or more certified charter vessels, from which vessel(s) fish arecaught that are a part of any cargo or shipment of fish to be importedinto the United States, regardless of any intervening transshipment. ``Kill-per-ton''means the number of small, toothed-cetaceans (marine mammals) killed-per-shortton of yellowfin tuna caught in sets made on marine mammals. ``Purse seineset on common dolphins'' means a purse seine set in which more than 50percent of the marine mammals captured are common dolphins.</ITAG>2. Adds the definition of ``Intermediary nation'' in andSection; 216.3 toidentify nations that are now required to ban importation of yellowfintuna from nations that are prohibited from importing yellowfin tuna directlyinto the United States.3. Modifies the language in paragraph (e)(3)(i) to reflect the additionof requirements for intermediary nations to qualify for importing tunainto the United States.4. Revises paragraph (e)(3)(ii) to adopt the new U.S. Harmonized TariffCodes.5. Modifies the Yellowfin Tuna Certificate of Origin in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)to require that ``the nation under whose laws the vessel operated'' beidentified instead of the country of registry for the harvesting vessel.This provides for the proper treatment of certified charter fishing vessels.NMFS added questions about the location of the harvest and the vessel tripdates for the tuna included in the shipment. These modifications were necessaryto improve the monitoring of tuna shipments that may be submitted for importationinto the United States from embargoed nations. The language in the declarationstatement in the Certificate of Origin in sub-paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(G) wasmodified to conform with the language used by the U.S. Customs in its documentationaccompanying the Certificate of Origin, and adds a cannery representativeas a person who can sign the certificate. In the case of canned tuna offeredfor importation into the United States, a representative of the foreigncannery which processed the tuna is the person who has access to the informationneeded to accurately complete the Yellowfin Certificate of Origin becauseone shipment of canned tuna may contain the catch from several vessels.6. Modifies paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(A) to reflect the 1988 MMPA amendmentswhich require that mortality rate data be collected by the IATTC or equivalentinternational observer program in which the United States participatesand to focus attention on the new measures that must be included in a harvestingnation's program for that program to remain comparable.7. Clarifies the language in paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(C) to require nationsto submit data for any vessel that fished in the ETP any time during acalendar year; and requires the inclusion of data on the number of marinemammals observed to be seriously injured, the number of trips, and on thenumber of purse seine sets by fishing area.8. Adds a new paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(D) to require the submission of datafor the individual species and stocks currently identified in the IATTCobserver program plus coastal spotted dolphins. These species and stocksare northern and southern offshore spotted dolphin, eastern spinner dolphin,northern and southern whitebelly spinner dolphin, northern, southern andcentral common dolphin and other dolphins.9. Modifies paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(E) to comply with the 1988 amendmentsto the MMPA. This paragraph now requires the data reported to the UnitedStates to be collected by the IATTC or other international observer programin which the United States participates. It also requires that the AssistantAdministrator issue a negative finding to a nation whose observer coveragefor any year falls below the level of observer coverage achieved by theU.S. program for the same period, unless the Assistant Administrator determinesthat the level of coverage achieved by the harvesting nation provides asufficiently reliable estimate of the average mortality rate for that nation'sfleet.10. Clarifies the language in paragraph (e)(5)(iii) to explain that a findingmay be terminated before the end of the next calendar year if the subsequentannual report is not submitted by July 31 (for nations participating inthe IATTC observer program, within 14 days after the date the IATTC releasesdata on porpoise mortality), or if that report indicates the nation's programor mortality rate are no longer comparable to the United States.11. Adds to paragraph (e)(5)(v) a new paragraph (B) requiring harvestingnations to adopt substantially the same restrictions for their vesselswithin 180 days of the date such restrictions are applied to U.S. vessels,unless other timing is specifically required in the statute.12. Adds a new paragraph (e)(5)(v)(D) to reflect the 1988 MMPA amendmentrequirement for the harvesting nations to maintain observer coverage equalto that achieved by the United States, unless the Assistant Administratordetermines a lesser level of coverage provides a sufficiently accuratesample of the nation's fleet mortality rate;13. Redesignates paragraph (e)(5)(v)(A)(<T3>4</T3>) as (e)(5)(v)(E) and modifies the language to establish that,by the end of the 1990 fishing year, the average kill-per-ton rate forany nation, regardless of its fleet size, can be no more than 25 percentgreater than the U.S. average for the same time period rather than the25/75 percent standard previously adopted. This subparagraph also incorporatesa provision for weighing a nation's observed mortality before comparingit to the U.S. rate to account for dissimilar fishing activity betweenthe two nations' fleets in the three designated ETP areas. The weighingprovision was contained in paragraph (e)(5)(v)(D) of the original interimrule.14. Adds a new paragraph (e)(5)(v)(F) which reflects the mortality ratecomparison standards contained in the MMPA amendments. For data collectedthrough 1989, a nation's mortality rate must be no greater than twice theU.S. rate for the same period.15. Adds a new paragraph (e)(5)(v)(G) which establishes that harvestingnations must limit the kill of eastern spinner dolphin and coastal spotteddolphin to 15 percent and 2 percent, respectively, of the nation's totalannual dolphin mortality for 1989 and subsequent fishing years.16. Adds a new paragraph (e)(5)(v)(H) which requires the Assistant Administratorto consider the harvesting nation's cooperation in conducting dolphin populationassessments when making a finding.17. Deletes paragraph (e)(5)(v)(B) which contained proposed criteria forcomparing a harvesting nation's mortality rate to the U.S. mortality rateduring a five-year baseline period (1986-90). The criteria for comparisonare now found in section (e)(5)(v)(A). The negative trend test which wasproposed has been eliminated in response to the 1988 MMPA amendments.18. Eliminates paragraph (e)(5)(v)(C) which described the variable 25/75percent standard for nations with fewer than five observed trips. Thatstandard was changed to 25 percent only and is now contained in (e)(5)(v)(E).19. Eliminates paragraph (e)(5)(v)(D) which provided for weighing the harvestingnation's mortality rate before comparing it with the U.S. rate. The weighingprovision is now contained in (e)(5)(v)(E).20. Eliminates paragraph (e)(5)(v)(E) which would have allowed the AssistantAdministrator to consider special circumstances with a request for a finding.21. Eliminates paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(B) and modifies paragraph (e)(5)(vii)(A)to reflect the submission of applications for initial findings that werereceived in response to the original interim rule. The findings for countriesthat had findings in effect on April 15, 1988, that did not submit therequired paperwork by August 16, 1988, terminated on October 15, 1988.22. Adds paragraph (e)(5)(viii) to require that the kill and serious injurydata for individual species and stocks of marine mammals taken in 1986,1987, and 1988 be included in the annual report covering 1988. This isnecessary as the effective date of this rule requiring these new data willbe after the August 16, 1988 due date for submitting applications for aninitial finding under the interim final rule.23. Adds a new paragraph (e)(5)(ix) which establishes the requirement forintermediary nations to ban imports of yellowfin tuna from any nation thatis banned from exporting yellowfin tuna directly to the United States andprovides for an embargo against yellowfin tuna and tuna products from anyintermediary nation that does not comply with this requirement. The Secretarymay waive this requirement for intermediary nations with no history ofimporting tuna from embargoed nations.24. Adds a new paragraph (e)(5)(x) which requires certification of a nationunder section 8 of the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 if an embargoagainst that nation under this section remains in effect for six months.25. Eliminates the requirement in (e)(5)(i) that the Assistant Administratorconsult with the Department of State in making a finding that imports canbe allowed into the United States. Because the regulations did not provideexplicitly for any role for the Department of State in the converse situation,in Agency decision-making leading to tuna being embargoed, and becausethe Department of State is not provided a consultive role in the MarineMammal Protection Act, and based upon the actual needs of the Departmentof State in implementing this system, the limited consultation provisionis replaced with a provision in the regulations at (e)(5)(xi) providingthat the Assistant Administrator will promptly advise the Department ofState of both embargo decisions and actions and finding decisions for itsinformation and use.26. Makes various editorial and numbering changes to conform the numberingas necessary to the changes made and to improve the clarity of certainsentences.<ITAG tagnum="84">Revised Interim Final Rule</ITAG>Requirements for Importation: Two-Part TestThis revised interim final rule implements two categories of requirementsfor yellowfin tuna importation certifications (``Two Part Test''). ThisTwo Part Test will be used each year to determine whether to grant or extenda finding of comparability for any nation that has one or more vesselsor certified charter vessels of greater than 400 short tons carrying capacitythat purse seines for tuna in the ETP. This minimum vessel size is consistentwith the U.S. experience that smaller vessels cannot effectively set anddo not set on marine mammals.First, a nation must have a regulatory program to protect marine mammalsthat is comparable to the U.S. program. The annual evaluation of the regulatoryprogram will consider the comparability of laws, regulations, guidelines,the observer program, and the enforcement program which govern vessel operatorsand the gear and techniques they must use to prevent or minimize the numberof marine mammals killed and seriously injured when purse seining for yellowfintuna.The second part of the test assesses the effectiveness of each nation'sregulatory program based upon the nation's annual marine mammal kill rate.Each nation must demonstrate, using reliable and verifiable data, thatthe average annual rate of incidental mortality of marine mammals per tonof yellowfin tuna taken with marine mammals from fishing vessels operatingunder its laws is comparable, as set forth in these regulations, to theincidental rate of marine mammal mortality achieved by U.S. vessels fishingin the same geographic area and in association with the same species groups.For purposes of this test, two species groups are considered, common dolphinsand all other marine mammal species. We will also consider three geographicalareas. The reasons for partitioning mortality data by species group andby area were explained in the preamble of the earlier rule (53 FR 8910).Beginning with fishing in 1989, limitations on the taking of eastern spinnerdolphin and coastal spotted dolphin also are included in the test. Thecomparable regulatory program test will be applied immediately and thekill rate test will be applied beginning in 1990. The kill rate test requiresthat the average kill per ton of a harvesting nation's fleet must be nogreater than twice that of the U.S. fleet for the same time period by theend of 1989 and no greater than 1.25 times the U.S. rate for the same timeperiod by the end of 1990 and thereafter.Additional information may be requested from the nation before issuingan affirmative finding. An affirmative finding for the regulatory programtest is likely to be issued if the program contains provisions substantiallysimilar to those of the United States. Copies of the relevant U.S. regulationshave been provided to all interested nations. Each nation's submissionmust be sufficiently documented and in adequate detail so that the AssistantAdministrator will be able to determine that the nation's regulatory programis comparable in substance and effectiveness to the U.S. program.The minimum documentation requirements are set forth in the regulations,and further explained in this preamble. Any nation that does not have anexisting finding of comparability but has one or more vessels of greaterthan 400 short tons carrying capacity using purse seine gear in the ETPthat desires to export yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products to theUnited States must submit documentation to support a finding at least 120days prior to the date it wishes the finding to be effective. A nationwhich has an affirmative finding in effect and is applying for renewal,must apply for renewal annually by submitting its report by July 31 or,if the nation participates in the IATTC observer program, within 14 daysafter the IATTC releases the required observer data, whichever is later.For renewal of an affirmative finding, the regulations provide that onlynew and changed information, including a description of the implementationof its program, must be provided. Existing information on file need notbe resubmitted.Comparable Regulatory Program Test1. Marine mammal rescue gear, equipment and procedural requirements andguidelines.At a minimum, the gear and procedural requirements must include the installationand use of a superapron or fine mesh system in the purse seine net, a backdownprocedure, the availability of speedboats with towing bridles to hold opennets, the availability of a raft to aid live animals after backdown, aprohibition on brailing and sacking up live animals from the net, and theinstallation and use during darkness of a lighting system capable of illuminatingthe backdown channel with at least 140,000 lumens. Sets on pure schoolsof eastern spinner dolphins and on pure schools of any other species ofmarine mammals except offshore spotted dolphin stocks, striped dolphinspecies, and common dolphin species must be prohibited.By the beginning of the 1990 fishing year, additional requirements mustbe met for a program to be comparable. Purse seine sets on marine mammalsmust be required to be completed through backdown to rolling the net tosack-up by one-half hour after sundown, except that operators with demonstratedkill rates in sundown sets that are consistently as low as the fleet'sdaylight set average may be exempted from this prohibition. Use of explosivedevices must be prohibited with the following exception. Explosive devicesmay be used to influence the movements of marine mammals, if the devicesmeet the following description (taken from 49 CFR 173.100(ii)):<ITAG tagnum="21">Explosive pest control devices, Class C explosives, consist of a cardboard-pasteboardtype tube not exceeding 4 inches in length and \3/4\ inch in diameter ora shotgun shell type having an explosive projectile. They may contain amixture of potassium perchlorate, aluminum powder, sulfur, black powder,smokeless powder or similar pyrotechnic mixture. The component which producesthe audible effect may not contain more than 40 grains of explosive composition.</ITAG>The 1988 amendments further require that NOAA study the effects of ClassC explosive devices on marine mammals in the tuna fishery and possiblyrestrict or prohibit their use by April 1, 1989. Should additional restrictionsbe applied to U.S. vessels, similar restrictions would have to be adoptedby other harvesting nations to maintain a comparable program.2. Observer ProgramAn observer program must be used to monitor the effectiveness of marinemammal rescue gear and procedures and to record the number of marine mammalsby stock which are killed and seriously injured during fishing operations.To be comparable with the U.S. observer program, a nation must participatein the IATTC or other international observer program in which the UnitedStates participates and that program must achieve a level of observer coverageequal to that achieved by the U.S. program during the same period. TheAssistant Administrator may determine, after 60 days notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, that an alternative observer program is acceptablebecause it will provide a sufficiently reliable estimate of the nation'smortality rate. This includes making a determination that an alternativeprogram with a lower level of observer coverage is acceptable because itprovides a sufficiently reliable estimate of a nation's mortality rate.3. A System to Deal With Operators With ProblemsAn advisory group must exist to identify problems and to provide solutionsto improve the performance of individual fishermen in reducing incidentalmarine mammal mortality. A panel of expert fishing captains is used bythe U.S. industry as a peer advisory group to review and improve individualskipper performance. A similar peer advisory group established by an individualnation or cooperatively with other nations on a regional basis, would beconsidered comparable, as would an advisory group of technical experts.When working with operators with problems, we expect these advisory groupsto pay particular attention to sets that had a mortality of 15 animalsor more. The U.S. industry uses this level of mortality as a thresholdlevel above which the individual set is examined to determine what thecause of high mortality was. These sets require special attention by thenation to analyze operator performance or the effectiveness of fishingtechniques to avoid future mortalities from similar causes.By the beginning of 1990, a nation must have a system for identifying operatorswith consistently and substantially higher mortality rates than the majorityof the nation's fleet, for the purpose of providing remedial training tothese operators, and, if performance does not improve to that of the majorityof the fleet, for removing the operator from the fishery.Comparable Mortality Rate TestAs required by the 1988 amendments, this rule requires that by the endof the 1989 fishing year, a nation must achieve a fleet average marinemammal kill-per-ton rate that is no greater than twice that of the U.S.fleet for the same time period. By the end of the 1990 fishing year, theforeign nation's rate may not exceed 1.25 times that of the U.S. fleetfor the same time period. For the purposes of this comparable rate test,a nation may offer the average rate for the most recent five year periodor the average rate for only the most recent year, whichever is lower.The method to be used to compare mortality rates is described in detailbelow. The rates of marine mammal mortality (kill-per-ton) estimated fromextensive observer data have varied significantly for the U.S. fleet since1979 in each fishing area (Figure 1). We assume that the foreign kill ratewill also vary significantly from year to year. To reduce this variability,NMFS will use a five year running average for kill rate comparison in 1990and in subsequent years. This will provide a larger data base for use inthe analysis. Most nations purse seining for tuna in the ETP were participatingin the IATTC observer program by 1986 and are expected to continue gatheringadequate data during the interim period of 1986 through 1990. If a countrydoes not have five years of adequate data because it was not fishing inthe ETP for one or more years, NMFS will use up to five years of data fromthose years for which the country was fishing and has data. If a nation'skill rate for the most recent year is lower than the multi-year average,the lower of the two averages will be used for comparison.There are significant differences in mortality rates in three differentareas of the ETP (Figure 2). These areas are the major inshore area (Area1) and offshore area (Area 2) and all other areas fished (Area 3). Also,the marine mammal kill rate in sets on common dolphin is significantlygreater than the kill rate from sets on all other species. NMFS has decidedthat these differences should be accounted for in applying the kill ratetest. This results in a more fair and accurate comparison than a simplecomparison of rates which does not consider the effect of area and speciesdifferences upon mortality rates.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3510-22-M002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 269-270</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3510-22-C</ITAG>Therefore, the comparable mortality rate test will compare a nation's averagemortality rate to the average mortality rate of the United States whichis weighted to account for dissimilar amounts of fishing activity betweenthe United States and the foreign nation in three discrete fishing areasand for two groupings of dolphin species. The foreign nation's averagemortality rate using the most recent year of data, or the average of allof the data available from the last five years, whichever is lower, willbe used to compare with the kill rates from the U.S. fleet for the sameperiod.In addition to this comparable rate test, each nation must limit its annualincidental mortality of eastern spinner dolphin and coastal spotted dolphinto 15 percent and 2 percent of its total marine mammal mortality. If theselevels are exceeded in 1989 or any subsequent fishing year, the AssistantAdministrator cannot make an affirmative finding for that nation. As aconsequence, that nation's yellowfin tuna will be embargoed for at leastone year.Formulas Used to Calculate Foreign and U.S. Mortality RatesThe mortality rate (dolphins killed/ton yellowfin caught) for each foreignnation R<T2>f</T2> is calculated using data stratified by year, species groupingand area as<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>10,L0,b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,4,r14,r14,r14,r14,1,r14,r14,r14,r14</C><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D/>m<D/>2<D/>3<D> </D><D> </D><D/>m<D/>2<D/>3<ITAG tagnum="22">R</ITAG><T2>f</T2>=<D/>S <D/>S <D/>S<D>M</D><T2>ijk</T2><D>/</D><D/>S<D/>S<D/>S<D>C</D><T2>ijk</T2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D/>i=1<D/>j=1<D/>k=1<D> </D><D> </D><D/>i=1<D/>j=1<D/>k=1<ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">where M<T2>ijk</T2> equals the number of dolphins killed during year i, of speciesgroup j and in area k and C<T2>ijk</T2> is the tons of yellowfin tuna caught during year i, on speciesgroup j and in area k.

C<T2>ijk</T2> equals the tons of yellowfin tuna caught by the foreign nationduring year i, on species grouping j, and in area k and C . . . is thetotal catch of the foreign nation for all years, species groupings, andareas combined.Finally, the U.S. rate (R<T2>US</T2>) is multiplied by 1.25 to apply the standard that nations musthave a kill rate within 25 percent of the U.S. rate.

Intermediary nations must certifyto the U.S. Government that they have acted within 60 days of the U.S.ban to prohibit imports of yellowfin tuna and tuna products from a nationthat is banned from directly exporting tuna to the United States. Intermediarynations that fail to provide such a certification within 90 days of theU.S. ban will not be allowed to import yellowfin tuna into the United States.The rule provides intermediary nations an additional 30 days to certifytheir action to the U.S. government. This period for notification to reachour government is intended to allow intermediary nations the full 60 daysto be informed of the U.S. embargo of a nation's tuna and to take the necessarysteps to prohibit import of the same products.The reference to intermediary nations was contained in the 1988 amendmentsto the MMPA and is intended to prevent embargoed nations from circumventingthe embargo by passing their tuna through other nations for importationinto the United States. However, the amendment also provides the Secretarywith discretion to consider its requirements and purposes satisfied withoutrequiring formal governmental certifications when there is no reason tosuspect that nations are importing tuna from embargoed nations. Accordingly,a nation, which the Secretary determines does not obtain any part of itstuna supply from embargoed nations, will not be required to certify thatit has banned imports from the embargoed nation or nations. Each nationtherefore, which expects to export tuna to the United States, should determinefrom its citizens whether yellowfin tuna from a nation whose tuna is prohibitedfrom entry into the United States is also imported into their country.If a nation learns that it imported such tuna, then appropriate action,described above, should be taken. Should an intermediary nation be embargoedunder this rule, other intermediary nations would be required to prohibityellowfin imports from that nation as well, if they wish to continue toimport tuna into the United States.As of the date of publication of this rule, only El Salvador is prohibitedfrom exporting yellowfin tuna and yellowfin tuna products to the UnitedStates. The U.S.S.R., which was prohibited from exporting yellowfin tunato the United States under the previous rule (53 FR 8910, March 18, 1988),has not participated in the ETP fishery for over two years. Therefore,the prohibition on the importation of yellowfin tuna and tuna productsinto the United States is no longer appropriate and is hereby rescinded.The time period for intermediary nations to embargo tuna imported fromthese nations with existing embargoes will start running from the effectivedate of these regulations. The United States considers the publicationof these regulations as the first effective opportunity to advise themto comply with these provisions recently added to the Marine Mammal ProtectionAct by the 1988 amendments.<T3>Embargo of All Fish Products</T3>This revised interim final rule requires that the Secretary of Commercecertify to the President when a ban on tuna imports under this rule remainsin effect for six months. That certification will be considered a certificationfor the purposes of section 8 of the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967and could trigger an embargo on all fish products from the nation thatwas subject to the initial import ban. This provision applies to both harvestingand intermediary nations.Certifications in Effect Before August 16, 1988For harvesting nations, a finding of comparability (or ``conformance'')in effect before August 16, 1988, will continue in effect until a determination(either affirmative or negative) is made on a new request for a findingunder these new regulations, if the request and required supporting documentationwere submitted by August 16, 1988. If a request and documentation froma harvesting nation were not received by that date, the existing findingof conformance was rescinded and yellowfin tuna and tuna products fromthat nation were banned from importation into the United States. That bancontinues until a new finding of comparability is made.Certifications in Effect on the Date This Rule is PublishedA finding of comparability that is in effect on the date these regulationsare published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>will remain in effect until a new finding ismade based on the application for renewal that is required to be submittedby July 31, 1989 or, if the nation participates in the IATTC observer program,within 14 days after the IATTC release the required observer data, whicheveris later. Should a nation with an affirmative finding fail to apply fora renewal of its finding by the required date, the finding will be terminatedand imports from that nation will be banned.ConfidentialityAll data submitted by foreign nations in compliance with this rule willbe kept confidential as allowed by U.S. law. Generally, this means thatconfidential business information will be made available to the publiconly in aggregated form.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>This rule is being issued as an interim final rule because the statuterequires harvesting nations meet action requirements by January 1, 1989,as well as additional requirements that must be in place by 1990. Publiccomment prior to publication is therefore impracticable.The Assistant Administrator has determined that the modifications to theregulations being made at 50 CFR 216.24(e) will not have a significantimpact on the human environment. NMFS has prepared an environmental assessment(EA) on the modification. The conclusion of that EA was a finding of nosignificant impact on the human environment, other than economic and socialimpacts. Therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required.The EA is available upon request (see <T2>ADDRESS</T2>).The Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere has determined that thisrule is a ``major'' Federal action under Executive Order 12291. The potentialannual effect on the U.S. economy, in the worst case, would exceed $100million. However, this interim final rule is exempt from the advance reviewrequirements of Executive Order 12291 under section 8(a)(2), which exemptsactions that must meet statutory or judicial deadlines. Deadlines imposedby the Marine Mammal Protection Act Amendments of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-711)require that yellowfin tuna harvesting nations act to comply with provisionsof the statute beginning January 1, 1989. This rule is being reported tothe Director of the Office of Management and Budget with an explanationof why it is not possible to follow the procedures of that order. The Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply since the opportunity forpublic comment prior to publication of the interim final rule is not requiredby the Marine Mammal Protection Act or any other act. As a result, a RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis was not prepared.This rule contains collections of information subject to the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). The collections which aresubject to the Act are found at 50 CFR 216.24(e) (3) and (4) and have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB ControlNumber 0648-0040.Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average .50 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Importers arerequired to present the information on a form 370-1 ``Yellowfin Tuna Certificateof Origin'' at the time of entry. Burden hours for the salmon/halibut collectionis estimated to be the same as for yellowfin tuna. Send comments regardingthese burden estimates, or any other aspect of this collection of informationincluding suggestions for reducing this burden, to the National MarineFisheries Service ((F/PR1), 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910,and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Managementand Budget, Washington, DC 20503 (Attn: Paperwork Reduction Act Project0648-0040)).This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR 216</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Imports, Marine mammals, Penalties,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: March 1, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.

Upon receipt of a statement of conformance, the AssistantAdministrator may then make a finding, and publish such finding in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>, that fish imports listed in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)of this section from the nation were not caught with commercial fishingtechnology which results in the incidental kill of marine mammals in excessof U.S. standards.(5) <T3>Yellowfin tuna. </T3>(i) Any tuna or tuna products in the classificationslisted in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, from harvesting nationswhose vessels of greater than 400 short tons carrying capacity operatein the ETP tuna purse seine fishery as determined by the Assistant Administrator,may not be imported into the United States unless the Assistant Administratormakes an affirmative finding and publishes the finding in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> that:(A) The government of the harvesting nation has adopted a regulatory programgoverning the incidental taking of marine mammals in the course of suchharvesting that is comparable to the regulatory program of the United States;and(B) The average rate of incidental mortality by the vessels of the harvestingnation is comparable to the average rate of incidental mortality of marinemammals by U.S. vessels in the course of such harvesting.(ii) A harvesting nation which desires an initial finding under these regulationsthat will allow it to import into the United States those products listedin paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section must provide the Assistant Administratorwith the following information:(A) A detailed description of the nation's regulatory and enforcement programgoverning incidental taking of marine mammals in the purse seine fisheryfor yellowfin tuna, including:(<T3>1</T3>) A description, with copies of relevant laws, implementing regulationsand guidelines, of the gear and procedures required in the fishery to protectmarine mammals, including but not limited to the following:(<T3>i</T3>) A description of the methods used to identify problems andto take corrective actions to improve the performance of individual fishermenin reducing incidental mortality and serious injury. By 1990 the methodsmust identify individual operators with marine mammal mortality rates whichare consistently and substantially higher than the majority of the nation'sfleet, and provide for corrective training and, ultimately, suspensionand removal from the fishery if the operator's performance does not improveto at least the performance of the majority of the fleet in a reasonabletime period;(<T3>ii</T3>) By 1990, a description of a regulatory system in operationwhich ensures that all marine mammal sets are completed through backdownto rolling the net to sack-up no later than one-half hour after sundown,except that individual operators may be exempted, if they have maintainedconsistently a rate of kill during their observed sundown sets which isnot higher than that of the nation's fleet average during daylight setsmade during the time period used for their comparability finding; and(<T3>iii</T3>) By 1990, a description of its restrictions on the use ofexplosive devices in the purse seine fishery which are comparable to thoseof the United States.(<T3>2</T3>) A detailed description of the method (e.g., IATTC or otherinternational program observer records), and level, of observer coverageby which the incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammalswill be monitored;(B) A list of its vessels and any certified charter vessels of greaterthan 400 short tons carrying capacity which purse seined for yellowfintuna at any time during the preceding two years in the ETP, indicatingthe status of each such vessel during that two year period (i.e. activelyfishing in ETP, fishing in other waters; in port for repairs; inactive)and the status of each vessel expected to operate in the ETP in the yearin which the submission is made.(C) A compilation of the best available data for the 1986 calendar yearand each subsequent calendar year on the performance of any of its purseseine vessels (including certified charter vessels) fishing at any timefor tuna associated with marine mammals within the ETP including the following:(<T3>1</T3>) Total number of tons of yellowfin tuna observed caught in eachfishing area by purse seine sets on:(<T3>i</T3>) Common dolphin and(<T3>ii</T3>) All other marine mammal species;(<T3>2</T3>) Total number of marine mammals in each fishing area by species/stockobserved killed and seriously injured by purse seine sets on:(<T3>i</T3>) Common dolphin and(<T3>ii</T3>) All other marine mammal species;(<T3>3</T3>) Total number of observed trips and total number of observedpurse seine sets on marine mammals in each fishing area by the nation'spurse seine fleet during the year;(<T3>4</T3>) Total number of vessel trips and total number of purse seinesets on marine mammals in each fishing area by the nation's purse seinefleet during the year; and(<T3>5</T3>) The total number of observed purse seine sets in each fishingarea in which more than 15 marine mammals were killed.(D) Data required by paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(C)(<T3>2</T3>) presented individually for the following marine mammal species/stocks:offshore spotted dolphin, coastal spotted dolphin, eastern spinner dolphin,whitebelly spinner dolphin, common dolphin, striped dolphin, and ``othermarine mammals''.(E) A description of the source of the data provided in accordance withparagraph (e)(5)(ii)(C) of this section. The observer program from whichthese data are provided must be operated by the IATTC or another internationalprogram in which the United States participates and must sample at leastthe same percentage of the fishing trips as the United States achievesover the same time period, unless the Assistant Administrator determinesthat an alternate observer program, including a lesser level of observercoverage, will provide a sufficiently reliable average rate of incidentaltaking for the nation.(iii) A nation applying for its initial finding of comparability shouldapply at least 120 days before the desired effective date. The AssistantAdministrator's determination on a nation's application for its initialfinding will be announced and published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> within 120 days of receipt of the informationrequired in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section. A finding is valid onlyfor the period for which it was issued, and may be terminated before theend of the year if the Assistant Administrator finds that the nation nolonger has a comparable regulatory program or kill rate.(iv) A harvesting nation, which has in effect a positive finding underthis section, may request renewal of its finding for the subsequent calendaryear by providing the Assistant Administrator July 31, or for nations participatingin the IATTC observer program, within 14 days after the date the IATTCreleases data on porpoise mortality, whichever is later, an annual reportupdating the information listed in andSection; 216.24(e)(5)(ii) which iscurrent through the previous full calendar year.(v) The Assistant Administrator will make an affirmative finding or renewan affirmative finding for a harvesting nation if:(A) The harvesting nation has provided all information required by paragraphs(e)(5)(ii) and (e)(5)(iv) of this section;(B) The nation's regulatory program is comparable to the regulatory programof the United States as described in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d)(2),and (f) of this section and the nation has incorporated into its regulatoryprogram such additional prohibitions as the United States may apply toits own vessels within 180 days after the prohibition applies to U.S. vessels,except that provisions for identifying and removing problem operators,prohibiting sundown sets, and restricting the use of explosives describedin (e)(5)(ii)(A)(<T3>1</T3>) must be applied by a nation to its vessels by January 1, 1990;(C) The data on marine mammal mortality and serious injury submitted bythe harvesting nation are determined to be accurate;(D) The observer coverage of fishing trips was equal to that achieved bythe United States during the same time period or, if less, was determinedby the Assistant Administrator to provide a sufficiently accurate sampleof the nation's fleet mortality rate;(E) The average kill-per-ton rate for the longest period of time for whichdata are available, up to 5 consecutive years, or for the most recent year,whichever is lower, is no more than 25 percent greater than the U.S. averagefor the same time period, after the U.S. mortality rate is weighed to accountfor dissimilar amounts of fishing activities between the two nations inthe three ETP fishing areas and for common dolphin and other marine mammalspecies, except as provided in (e)(5)(v)(F) below for findings made in1990;(F) For findings made in 1990 only, which are based on data collected throughthe 1989 fishing year, a nation's average mortality rate is no more thantwice that of the U.S.-flag fleet for the same period, after the U.S. mortalityrate is weighed to account for dissimilar amounts of fishing activitiesbetween the two nations in the three ETP fishing areas and for common dolphinand other marine mammal species;(G) For the 1989 fishing year and subsequent years, the nation's observedkill of eastern spinner dolphin (<T3>Stenella longirostris</T3>) and coastal spotted (<T3>Stenella attenuata</T3>) dolphin is no greater than 15 percent and2 percent, respectively, of the nation's total annual observed dolphinmortality; and(H) The nation has complied with all reasonable requests by the AssistantAdministrator for cooperation in carrying out dolphin population assessmentsin the ETP.(vi) The Assistant Administrator may require verification of statementsmade in connection with requests to allow importations. The Assistant Administratormay reconsider a finding upon a request from and the submission of additionalinformation by the harvesting nation.(vii) Any finding in effect on April 18, 1988 will remain in effect untilthe Assistant Administrator's decision on the 1988 application is announcedor until September 1, 1989, whichever is earlier, if the Assistant Administratorreceived on or before August 16, 1988, a valid, signed and substantiallycomplete application for a new finding.(viii) The 1988 annual report (to be submitted in 1989) required in paragraph(e)(5)(iv) of this section, must include data for the years 1986, 1987,and 1988, as requested in paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(C)(<T3>2</T3>) of this rule, before the Assistant Administrator will considera request for a renewal of a finding in 1989. However, data on coastalspotted dolphin do not have to be submitted until the 1989 annual report.(ix) Any tuna or tuna products in the classifications listed in paragraph(e)(2)(i) of this section, from any intermediary nation, may not be importedinto the United States if the Assistant Administrator determines and publishesthe determination in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> that the intermediary nation has not providedreasonable proof and has not certified to the United States that it hasacted to ban the importation into its nation of all yellowfin tuna andtuna products from those nations from which the United States has bannedthe importation of yellowfin tuna and tuna products. The Secretary willnot require an intermediary nation to certify that it has implemented aban on yellowfin tuna and tuna products from nations embargoed by the UnitedStates, if the Secretary is satisfied that the intermediary nation importstuna products, directly or indirectly, from sources other than an embargoednation. The intermediary nation's ban must be effective within sixty daysof the effective date of the United States ban to avoid a determinationprohibiting importation, and the intermediary nation must supply the AssistantAdministrator with the reasonable proof and certification within 90 daysof the effective date of the United States ban in order to avoid impositionof the embargo on the 91st day. An embargo under this paragraph may belifted by the Assistant Administrator upon a determination announced inthe <T4>Federal Register,</T4> based upon new information supplied by the embargoednation, that the nation has acted to ban yellowfin tuna and tuna productsfrom those nations from which the United States has banned the importationof yellowfin tuna and tuna products.(x) After six months of an embargo being in place against a nation underthis section, that fact shall be certified to the President for purposesof certification under section 8(a) of the Fishermen's Protective Act of1967 (22 U.S.C. 1978(a)) for as long as the embargo is in effect.(xi) The Assistant Administrator will promptly advise the Department ofState of embargo decisions and actions and of finding determinations.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-5154 Filed 3-2-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3510-22-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
