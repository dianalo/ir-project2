CohenStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)SUPREME COURT (SUP) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Institutional money managers attacked a Supreme Court decision regulating hostile takeover bids, contending that it could cost shareholders a lot of money by curbing takeovers.    The high court ruling &quot;will hurt shareholders' bottom line,&quot; said Harvey P. Eisen, president of Integrated Asset Management Corp.    &quot;I'm appalled at the decision,&quot; said Seth Glickenhaus, senior partner of Glickenhaus andamp; Co., a New York investment management concern. &quot;It raises serious questions about the intelligence and integrity of our highest courts.&quot;    The Supreme Court's ruling Tuesday upheld a strict Indiana takeover law that is now expected to be adopted by other states. Takeover lawyers and corporate raiders say that the decision will make hostile takeovers more costly and more difficult.    Under the Indiana law, an investor who buys more than 20% of a company's shares can't vote that stake unless he wins approval from a majority of &quot;disinterested&quot; shareholders. The law defines disinterested shareholders as everyone except officers, inside directors and the takeover investor.    Many investment managers have benefited handsomely from hostile bids that have forced companies to restructure or sell out at a premium. Some managers worried yesterday that there would be fewer takeover transactions as a result of the law and that more states will rush to pass laws similar to Indiana's.    &quot;We haven't been involved in quick money investments, but we have benefited from owning large blocks of stock in companies that were takeover targets,&quot; said Roland Machold, director of New Jersey's Division of Investment. Mr. Machold believes that the ruling will &quot;make management much more thoroughly entrenched,&quot; and there will be fewer opportunities to profit from hostile bids.    Institutional money managers object most to the provision of the Indiana law that renders a bidder's stock neutral unless the bidder's voting power is ratified at a shareholders' meeting. &quot;The ruling flies in the face of the one-share, one-vote principle,&quot; said Mr. Machold, who is also co-chairman of the Council of Institutional Investors, a group of public employees and union pension fund managers.    James S. Martin, chief investment officer of the College Retirement Equities Fund, said that the Supreme Court &quot;shouldn't be getting into the process&quot; of determining what is &quot;good or bad for shareholders.&quot; While he doesn't believe that the ruling will discourage all hostile bidders, Mr. Martin believes the decision &quot;has further insulated shareholders from management&quot; by removing some of the shareholders' power.    But one money manager yesterday found a silver lining in the cloud that the Supreme Court's ruling is expected to cast over hostile takeover bids. &quot;Every time you make hostile takeovers less likely, some clever lawyer will find a way to mount one as long as the profit opportunity is there,&quot; said Dean LeBaron, trustee of Boston-based Batterymarch Financial Management. </TEXT></DOC>
