We also determine that critical circumstances exist withrespect to imports of certain classes or kinds of AFBs from the UK, asoutlined in the ``Critical Circumstances'' section of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Case History </ITAG>Since our notice of preliminary determinations (53 FR 45312, November 9,1988), the following events have occurred. All respondents and the petitionerrequested that the final determinations in all of the antidumping dutyinvestigations be postponed until not later than 135 days after the dateof publication of the preliminary determinations, pursuant to section 735(a)(2)(A)of the Act. On December 2, 1988, we issued a notice postponing our finaldeterminations until not later than March 24, 1989 (53 FR 49581, December8, 1988). That notice also announced the scheduling of the public hearingin these investigations. Verification of the questionnaire responses was conducted in the UK andthe United States during November and December 1988 and January and February1989. A public hearing was held on February 14, 1989. Petitioner, respondents,and other interested parties have filed pre- and post-hearing briefs. <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigations </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule </T3>(HTS), and all merchandise enteredor withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after that date is nowclassified solely according to the appropriate HTS item number(s). TheDepartment is providing both the appropriate <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated </T3>(TSUSA) item number(s)and the appropriate HTS item number(s) with its product descriptions forconvenience and Customs purposes. The Department's written descriptionof the products under investigation remains dispositive as to the scopeof the products covered by these investigations. These determinations cover ball bearings, mounted or unmounted, and partsthereof (ball bearings); spherical roller bearings; mounted or unmounted,and parts thereof (spherical roller bearings); cylindrical roller bearings,mounted or unmounted, and parts thereof (cylindrical roller bearings);needle roller bearings, mounted or unmounted, and parts thereof (needleroller bearings); and spherical plain bearings, mounted or unmounted, andparts thereof (including rod end bearings) (spherical plain bearings).For a complete description of these products, see Appendix A to the ``FinalDeterminations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Antifriction Bearings(Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from the FederalRepublic of Germany'' (hereinafter referred to as Appendix A) which ispublished in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. <ITAG tagnum="84">Class or Kind of Merchandise </ITAG>Subsequent to the initiation of these investigations, the Department determinedthat the products under investigation constituted five separate classesor kinds of merchandise. After consideration of all comments, arguments,and information submitted by the parties, we find no reason to alter thatdecision. For a full discussion of our position on class or kind of merchandise,see Appendix B which is referred to below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Standing </ITAG>We determine that petitioner has standing with respect to each of the fiveclasses or kinds of merchandise described in Appendix A. For a full discussionof standing see Appendix B which is referred to below. <ITAG tagnum="84">General Issues </ITAG>Appendix B to the ``Final Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value:Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereoffrom the Federal Republic of Germany'' (hereinafter referred to as AppendixB) contains detailed discussions of all issues timely raised by partiesto the proceeding in each of the concurrent antidumping duty investigationsinvolving AFBs from nine countries. The first part of that Appendix addressesall general issues raised during these investigations and our treatmentof these topics. The general issues discussed therein are listed below.<ITAG tagnum="15">1. Class or Kind of Merchandise </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">2. Standing </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">3.

For the reasons cited below, in accordance with section 776(c) of the Act,we have determined that use of the best information available is appropriatefor INA. This statutory provision requires the Department to use the bestinformation available ``whenever a party or any other person refuses oris unable to produce information requested in a timely manner or in theform required, or otherwise significantly impedes an investigation''. In accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, we have determined that useof the best information available is appropriate for INA. (<T3>See, </T3>Best Information Available section of Appendix B.) <ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price </ITAG>For those sales made directly to unrelated parties prior to importationinto the United States, we based the United States price on purchase price,in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act. In those cases where sales were made through a related sales agent in theUnited States to an unrelated purchaser prior to the date of importation,we also used purchase price as the basis for determining United Statesprice. For these sales, the Department determined that purchase price wasthe most appropriate determinant of United States price based on the followingelements: 1. the merchandise in question was shipped directly from the manufacturerto the unrelated buyer, without being introduced into the inventory ofa related selling agent; 2. this was the customary commercial channel for sales of this merchandisebetween the parties involved; and 3. the related selling agent located in the United States acted only asa processor of sales-related documentation and a communication link withthe unrelated U.S. buyer. Where all the above elements are met, we regard the routine selling functionsof the exporter as merely having been relocated geographically from thecountry of exportation to the United States, where the sales agent performsthem. Whether these functions take place in the United States or abroaddoes not change the substance of the transactions or the functions themselves.Where the sale to the first unrelated purchaser took place after importationinto the United States, we based United States price on exporter's salesprice (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act. The calculation of United States price for each class or kind of merchandisefor each respondent is detailed below. I. Ball Bearings A. <T3>RHP Bearings (RHP): </T3>RHP reported that more than 33 percent byvolume of its U.S. sales were identical to products sold in the home market.(<T3>See, </T3>Alternative Reporting Requirements section of Appendix B.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons. We calculated purchase price and ESP based on packed, f.o.b., and deliveredprices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductionsfrom purchase price and ESP, where appropriate, for brokerage and handling,foreign inland freight, transit insurance, ocean freight, U.S. duty, andU.S. inland freight in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Act. Wealso made deductions, where appropriate, for discounts and rebates. Wemade further deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for commissions, creditexpenses, credit notes, and indirect selling expenses (including advertising,technical services, inventory carrying expenses, product liability premiums,and other miscellaneous indirect selling expenses incurred in the U.S.and home markets) pursuant to section 772(e) (1) and (2) of the Act. Weadded the amount of value added taxes which would have been collected ifthe merchandise had not been exported. B. <T3>SKF (U.K.) Limited (SKF): </T3>SKF reported that more than 33 percentby volume of its U.S. sales were identical to products sold in the homemarket. (<T3>See, </T3>Alternative Reporting Requirements section of Appendix B.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons. All of SKF's U.S. sales were ESP transactions. We calculated ESP basedon packed, f.o.b. or delivered prices to unrelated customers in the UnitedStates. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for brokerage andhandling, duty, inland freight, marine insurance, and ocean freight, whichincluded foreign inland freight, in accordance with section 772(d)(2) ofthe Act. We also made deductions, where appropriate, for cash discountsand rebates. We made further deductions from ESP, where appropriate, forcredit, repacking expenses in the United States, technical service expenses,warranty expenses, and indirect selling expenses (including product liability,inventory carrying expenses, and other miscellaneous indirect selling expensesincurred in the U.S. and home markets) pursuant to sections 772(e) (1)and (2) of the Act. We added ``other expenses'' (<T3>i.e., </T3>price corrections). II. Spherical Roller Bearings <T3>SKF: </T3>SKF reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. Therefore, wehave used all U.S. sales with identical home market matches in our price-to-pricecomparisons. All of SKF's U.S. sales were ESP transactions. We calculated ESP for sphericalroller bearings based on packed, c.i.f., and delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. We added the amount of value added taxeswhich would have been collected if the merchandise had not been exported.The adjustments were identical to those described above for ball bearings.III. Cylindrical Roller Bearings <T3>RHP: </T3>RHP reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. Therefore, wehave used all U.S. sales with identical home market matches in our price-to-pricecomparisons. We calculated ESP for cylindrical roller bearings based on packed, f.o.b.and delivered prices to unrelated customers in the United States. The adjustmentswere identical to those described above for ball bearings. IV. Needle Roller Bearings <T3>INA Bearing Co., Ltd. (INA): See, </T3>Best Information Available sectionof Appendix B. V. Spherical Plain Bearings <T3>Rose Bearings, Ltd. (Rose): </T3>Rose reported that more than 33 percentby volume of its U.S. sales were identical to products sold in the homemarket. Therefore, except as noted below, we have used all U.S. sales withidentical home market matches in our price-to-price comparisons. We calculated purchase price based on packed, f.o.b. factory prices, netof discounts, to unrelated customers in the United States. We added theamount of value added taxes which would have been collected if the merchandisehad not been exported.All of Rose's sales were purchase price transactions. We have excludedfrom our calculation of United States price sales of bearings by Rose Bearingsto the U.S. government for military/defense procurement. These sales weremade under Schedule 8 of the TSUSA and were made prior to enactment ofthe Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the 1988 Act). As such,they will not be subject to any antidumping duties. <T3>See e.g., Final Affirmative Antidumping Duty Determination; TitaniumSponge from Japan, </T3>(49 FR 38687, October 1, 1984). Therefore, theseSchedule 8 bearings have not been included in our calculations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value </ITAG>In accordance with section 773(a) of the Act, we calculated foreign marketvalue based on home market sales and constructed value. The calculationof foreign market value for each class or kind of merchandise for eachrespondent is detailed below. I. Ball Bearings A. <T3>RHP: </T3>Petitioner alleged that RHP's home market sales of ball bearingswere made at prices below the cost of production (COP). Based on the petitioner'sallegation, we gathered and verified data on RHP's production costs forball bearings. We calculated the COP on the basis of RHP's cost of materials,labor, other fabrication costs and general and administrative expenses.The COP data submitted by RHP was relied upon, except in the followinginstances where the costs were not appropriately quantified or valued.These were: (1) Interest expense was adjusted from a division specific interest rateto a total company interest rate, calculated based on the percentage ofnet interest expense to cost of sales. (2) General and administrative (Gandamp;A) costs were adjusted from the divisionspecific Gandamp;A percentage as submitted to a weighted-average Gandamp;Apercentage. We calculated the foreign market value based on CV, where appropriate,in accordance with section 773(e) of the Act. CV was calculated on thebasis of RHP's material fabrication costs plus general expenses and profit.Actual general expenses were used since these exceeded the statutory minimumrequirement of ten percent of materials and fabrication. Actual averageprofit for ball bearings in the home market was used because this was higherthan the statutory minimum of eight percent. Imputed credit and inventorycarrying costs were included in selling expenses, therefore, interest expensereflected on the company books was reduced for a portion of the expenserelated to these activities in order to avoid double counting. All thechanges noted under the COP were also made to those cost elements in CV.Where we compared constructed value with purchase price transactions, weadded U.S. packing and adjusted for differences in circumstances of sale.For comparisons involving ESP transactions, we added U.S. packing and deductedall direct selling expenses and indirect selling expenses up to the amountof the ESP cap. Where we found that sufficient sales were above cost to permit the useof these sales as the basis for determining foreign market value, we calculatedforeign market value based on packed, c.i.f. prices to unrelated customersin the home market. We made deductions from the home market price, whereappropriate, for inland freight, transit insurance, home market packing,and rebates. We added U.S. packing to the home market price, in accordancewith section 773(a)(1) of the Act. For comparisons involving purchase price sales, we made adjustments tothe home market price, where appropriate, for differences in credit expensespursuant to 19 CFR 353.15. We made an adjustment for differences in circumstancesof sale for value-added tax paid on home market sales which was not includedin the price reported. For comparisons involving ESP transactions, we madefurther deductions from home market price, where appropriate, for creditexpenses and credit notes. We also deducted indirect selling expenses (includingadvertising, inventory carrying expenses, product liability insurance premiums,product liability expenses, technical services and other miscellaneousindirect selling expenses) in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c). We madean upward adjustment to the tax-exclusive home market prices for the value-addedtax we computed for United States price. B. <T3>SKF: </T3>Petitioner alleged that SKF U.K.'s home market sales of ballbearings were made at prices below the COP. Based on the petitioner's allegation,we gathered and verified data on SKF's production costs for ball bearings.We calculated the COP on the basis of SKF's cost of materials, labor, otherfabrication costs and general and administrative expenses. The COP datasubmitted by SKF U.K. was relied upon, except in the following instanceswhere the costs were not appropriately quantified or valued. These were:(1) Manufacturing costs for the fourth quarter of 1987 were adjusted toreflect the weighted-average result of 1987 because of unexplainable fluctuationsin costs among the quarters, (2) General expenses for the first quarter 1988 were adjusted to reflectSKF U.K.'s share of actual research and development (Randamp;D) expensesincurred by a related company, (3) Interest expense was adjusted to reflect the net financial expenserelated to operations of the SKF consolidated corporation,(4) General expenses were adjusted to correct a clerical error and to includea portion of the headquarter expenses which had not been allocated to thesubsidiaries.In accordance with section 773(a) of the Act, we calculated foreign marketvalue based on constructed value (CV) since there were insufficient salesat or above the COP. CV was calculated on the basis of SKF's material fabricationcosts plus general expenses and profit. Actual general expenses were usedsince these exceeded the statutory minimum requirement of ten percent ofmaterials and fabrication. The statutory eight percent minimum profit wasapplied. Imputed credit and inventory carrying costs were included in sellingexpenses, therefore, interest expense reflected on the company books wasreduced for a portion of the expense related to these activities in orderto avoid double counting. All the changes noted under the COP were alsomade to those cost elements in CV. We added U.S. packing. We deducted alldirect selling expenses and indirect selling expenses, up to the amountof the ESP cap.II. Spherical Roller Bearings<T3>SKF: </T3>Petitioner alleged that SKF's home market sales of sphericalroller bearings were made at prices below the COP. Based on the petitioner'sallegation, we gathered and verified data on SKF's production costs forspherical roller bearings. We calculated the COP on the same basis describedabove for ball bearings. The COP data submitted by SKF was relied upon,except in those instances listed above in the Foreign Market Value sectionof this notice for SKF ball bearings.In accordance with section 773(a) of the Act, we calculated foreign marketvalue based on home market prices since we found that all or sufficientsales were above cost to permit the use of these sales as the basis fordetermining foreign market value.We calculated foreign market value based on delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the home market. We made deductions from the home market price,where appropriate, for inland freight and rebates. We made no adjustmentfor packing.Since all U.S. transactions involved ESP, we made further deductions fromhome market price, where appropriate, for credit. We also deducted indirectselling expenses (including inventory carrying costs and other miscellaneousindirect selling expenses) in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c). We madean upward adjustment to the tax-exclusive home market prices for the value-addedtax we computed for United States price.SKF claimed deductions for inland freight based on the average cost perkilogram times the shipping weight of each product. SKF calculated theaverage cost per kilogram by dividing the total freight cost for the POIby the total weight shipped during the POI. SKF calculated the shippingweight for each product by multiplying the product's unit weight timesa factor derived from shipping documents. At verification, we found thatthis factor was not adequately supported by documentation. We recalculatedinland freight based on the average cost per kilogram times the unit weightof each product.SKF claimed deductions for rebates and based its claim on the average rebatepaid to all eligible customers. We have recalculated rebates accordingto the specific rebate percentage paid to each customer.SKF reported packing costs for home market and export sales based on materialand labor costs. At verification, we found these costs to be unsubstantiated.Because packing charges are essentially equivalent between markets, wemade no adjustment for packing. (<T3>See, </T3>Selling Expenses section of Appendix B.)SKF claimed a credit adjustment based on an interest rate derived fromthe commercial base rate. We recalculated credit based on the interestrate established during verification of the COP data. (<T3>See, </T3>Credit section of Appendix B.)SKF claimed an adjustment for inventory carrying cost based on the amountof time products spend in both the international and the domestic warehouse.We made an adjustment based on the amount of time products spend in theinternational warehouse. (<T3>See, </T3>Inventory Carrying Costs section of Appendix B.)SKF claimed an adjustment for indirect selling expenses based on sellingexpenses and expenses allocated as selling expenses. We recalculated indirectselling expenses based on selling expenses only. (<T3>See, </T3>Selling Expenses section of Appendix B.)III. Cylindrical Roller Bearings<T3>RHP: </T3>We calculated foreign market value for cylindrical rollerbearings based on packed, c.i.f. prices to unrelated customers in the homemarket. The adjustments were identical to those described above for ballbearings.IV. Needle Roller Bearings<T3>INA: See, </T3>Best Information Available section of Appendix B.V. Spherical Plain Bearings<T3>ROSE: </T3>We calculated foreign market value for spherical plain bearingsbased on the packed, f.o.b. destination prices, net of discounts, to unrelatedcustomers in the home market. We made deductions from the home market price,where appropriate, for inland freight, inland insurance, and home marketpacking. We added U.S. packing to the home market price, in accordancewith section 773(a)(1) of the Act.We made adjustments to home market price for differences in credit expensespursuant to 19 CFR 353.15. We also adjusted for commissions on sales inthe home market, where appropriate, using indirect selling expenses inthe United States as an offset to those commissions pursuant to section353.15(c) of our regulations. We made an adjustment for differences incircumstances of sale for value-added tax paid on home market sales whichwas not included in the price reported.We did not allow deductions for product liability premiums and advertisingexpenses because an examination of these expenses showed they were indirect,rather than direct, selling expenses. (<T3>See, </T3>Selling Expenses section of Appendix B.)<ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversion</ITAG>For comparisons involving purchase price transactions, we made currencyconversions in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a)(1). For comparisons involvingESP transactions, we used the official exchange rates in effect on thedates of U.S. sales, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act, asamended by section 615 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984. All currencyconversions were made at the rates certified by the Federal Reserve Bank.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Circumstances</ITAG>On August 1, 1988, petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' existwith respect to imports of the subject merchandise from the UK. Section735(a)(3) of the Act provides that critical circumstances exist if we determinethat:<ITAG tagnum="21">(A) (i) There is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhereof the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation;or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"> (ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise wasimported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value;and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) There have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation over a relatively short period.</ITAG>We generally consider the following factors in determining whether importshave been massive over a relatively short period of time: (1) The volumeand value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends (if applicable); and (3)the share of domestic consumption accounted for by imports. Because the Department's import data pertaining to the subject merchandiseare based on basket TSUSA categories, we requested specific data on shipmentsof the subject merchandise as the most appropriate basis for our determinationsof critical circumstances. Furthermore, we believe that company-specificcritical circumstances determinations better fulfill the objective of thecritical circumstances provision of deterring specific companies that maytry to increase imports massively prior to the suspension of liquidation.We asked all respondents in each of the AFB investigations to supply monthlyvolume shipment data from January 1986 through the present in order forthe Department to base the critical circumstances determinations on company-specificdata. We were unable to verify the shipment data provided by INA and SKF.(<T3>See, </T3>Critical Circumstances section of Appendix B.) Therefore,as best information available, we are assuming that imports of needle rollerbearings by INA and imports of ball and spherical roller bearings by SKFhave been massive over a relatively short period of time. Based on ouranalysis of the monthly shipment data submitted by respondents, and thebest information available for INA and SKF, we have found that importsof the following classes or kinds of merchandise from the companies listedbelow have been massive over a relatively short period of time.<ITAG tagnum="15">1. Ball Bearings_SKF </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">2. Spherical Roller Bearings_SKF </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">3. Cylindrical Roller Bearings_RHP </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">4. Needle Roller Bearings_INA</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Therefore, we find that the requirements of section 735(a)(3)(B) aremet for the above companies and classes or kinds of merchandise. We examined recent antidumping duty cases and found that there are currentlyno findings of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the subjectmerchandise by UK manufacturers, producers, and exporters of the subjectmerchandise. However, it is our standard practice to impute knowledge ofdumping under section 735(a)(3)(A) of the Act when the estimated marginsin our determinations are of such a magnitude that the importer shouldrealize that dumping exists with regard to the subject merchandise. Normallywe consider estimated margins of 25 percent or greater to be sufficient.<T3>See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; TaperedRoller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or Unfinished, from Italy </T3>(52FR 24198, June 29, 1987). However, in cases where the foreign manufacturersells in the United States through a related company, we consider thatlower margins may be sufficient. <T3>See, e g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; CertainInternal-Combustion, Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan </T3>(53 FR12552, April 15, 1988). Since INA, RHP, and SKF sell in the United Statesthrough related companies, and their margins are sufficiently high, wefind that the requirements of section 735(a)(3)(A) are met for these companieswith respect to the classes or kinds listed below. Therefore, the followingchart sets forth our company-specific determinations with respect to theexistence of critical circumstances for each company and each class orkind of merchandise from the UK.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1> </H1><H1> Critical Circumstances </H1>Ball bearings:<ITAG tagnum="2">RHP<D>No</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">SKF<D>Yes.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others<D>No.</D></ITAG>Spherical roller bearings:<ITAG tagnum="2">SKF<D>No.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others<D>No.</D></ITAG>Cylindrical roller bearings:<ITAG tagnum="2">RHP<D>Yes.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others<D>Yes.</D></ITAG>Needle roller bearings:<ITAG tagnum="2">INA<D>Yes.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others<D>No.</D></ITAG>Spherical plain bearings:<ITAG tagnum="2">Rose<D>No.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others<D>No. </D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Verification</ITAG>Except where noted, we verified the information used in making our finaldeterminations in accordance with section 776(b) of the Act. We used standardverification procedures including examination of relevant accounting recordsand original source documents of the respondents. Our verification resultsare outlined in the public versions of the verification reports which areon file in the Central Records Unit (Room B-099) of the Main Commerce Building.<ITAG tagnum="84">Interested Party Comments</ITAG>As noted above, all comments raised by parties to the proceedings in theantidumping duty investigations on AFBs from nine countries are discussedin Appendix B.<ITAG tagnum="84">Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation</ITAG>We are directing the U.S. Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidationof all entries of the subject merchandise, except spherical plain bearingsfrom the UK, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigations'' section of thisnotice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumptionon or after the date of publication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. In those situations where we have found affirmativecritical circumstances in both our preliminary determinations and finaldeterminations, the retroactive suspension of liquidation ordered in ourpreliminary determinations will remain in effect. In those situations wherehave found affirmative critical circumstances only in these final determinations,we are instructing the U.S. Customs Service to suspend liquidation of suchentries that are entered or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption,on or after the date which is 90 days prior to the date of publicationof the notice of the preliminary determinations in these investigationsin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.
