Godwin, the former undersecretary of defense foracquisition who was brought into the Pentagon to carry out reformsrecommended by another Californian, industrialist David Packard.   Godwin, the former president of Bechtel Civil and Minerals Inc.,also said Weinberger, the former defense secretary, was ``100percent wrong'' in defending the way the Pentagon buys weapons.   In a telephone interview Wednesday, Godwin called the Pentagonprocurement process a ``national crisis,'' as serious for theUnited States as drug trafficking and the AIDS epidemic.   ``We have institutionalized a bad system,'' said the 66-year-oldGodwin, who worked with Weinberger at Bechtel before PresidentReagan's election in 1980.   Bechtel Civil and Minerals was a division of Bechtel Group Inc.,the huge construction company based in San Francisco. Betweenassignments in Republican administrations, Weinberger served asvice president and general counsel of the Bechtel Group. Secretaryof State George P. Shultz was president of Bechtel Group from1975-1982.   Weinberger has said he thinks the Pentagon's weapons-buyingprocedures are generally adequate, but it is impossible toeliminate dishonesty on the part of some people.   Reagan said on Tuesday that although he does not condonemisconduct, some corruption is ``understandable'' in an enterpriseas big as the defense department, which spends $160 billion a yearon acquisitions and which, Weinberger noted Wednesday, lets morethan 50,000 contracts a day.   Godwin said he accepted the job as the first undersecretary ofdefense for acquisition in 1986 with the understanding that hewould stay only as long as he felt he was effective.   The post was created by Congress in the wake of a report byPackard's presidential commission recommending changes inprocurement practices. Packard served as deputy secretary ofdefense in the Nixon administration.   ``I determined the job was not do-able in large part because ofthe unwillingness to make some hard decisions,'' Godwin said.   Specificially, Godwin said Weinberger and Reagan refused to givehim the support he needed to create a central management system foracquisitions, giving one person control over Pentagon buying andstripping service chiefs of some of their authority to decide whichweapons system should be bought.   The service chiefs would no longer control the acquisitionssystem, though they would carry out instructions, he said.   His goal, Godwin said, was to run the Pentagon purchasing systemlike a corporation since the Defense Department is ``the biggestbusiness in the world,'' involving in some way over 100 millionpeople and spending more money than the gross national product ofsome countries.   Asked why Reagan and Weinberger did not back him in the way hefelt he needed to create a central management system, Godwin said,``I don't know. They just didn't support it.''   The showdown, Godwin said, came when Air Force Secretary EdwardC. Aldridge Jr. complained Godwin was ``getting intomicromanaging'' the Air Force. Aldridge simply ignored the centralmanagement plan and was not brought to heel by his superiors,Godwin said.   ``If you are ignored, I consider that as tantamount tonon-support,'' he said.   Aldridge was not immediately available for comment, hisspokesman said.   Without a central acquisitions system, no one person knows whatthe Defense Department is spending on weapons and how costs arebeing controlled, Godwin said. Moreover, no one is accountable, hesaid.   Instead, the service chiefs _ or ``warlords'' as Godwin calledthem _ go their own way, establish fiefdoms, lobby Congress formoney and let contracts for weapons.   Godwin, who serves on several boards of directors and operatesvineyards in Sonoma County, Calif., said he was unaware of thefederal investigation into allegations that bribes and gratuitieswere paid for crucial information about Pentagon contracts andsecret information was passed from the Pentagon to defensecontractors.   Authorities are looking into allegations that defensecontractors obtained classified information through theirconsultants in order to get billions of dollars of defensecontracts.   While Godwin said he did not come in contact with specificincidents of wrongdoing, he said the entire system needs to beoverhauled.   ``We have to make major changes in functions, authorities andaccountability,'' he said. One idea, Godwin said, is to have threepeople running the Pentagon: one to oversee the military'scombat-readiness; one to deal with policy matters; and a third tooperate the Pentagon business.   Asked if his policy disputes with Weinberger have soured theirrelationship, Godwin replied: ``We are not as we were.''</TEXT></DOC>
