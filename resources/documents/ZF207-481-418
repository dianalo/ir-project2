(Boston) is rapidlyapproaching PC saturation.andP;  Its 200 employees are equipped, collectively,with 190 personal computers.andP;  However, Keystone's vice predisent ofinformation services, Jerry Peters, has discovered that much of the existingequipment hasn't the horsepower or speed to tackle some jobs.andP;  &quot;We look upona 12-MHz 80286 system as our minimal future workstation,&quot; says Peters.andP;  Tomake room for more-powerful systems, Keystone Provident is selling its olderPCs to employees.andP;  So far, 60 employees have taken advantage of this offer.andM;Fierce upgrade pressureandM;For other organizations, having too many PCs is a problem they wish they had.andO;But even in these companies, there's fierce upgrade pressure from employeeswho need newer equipment that is more in line with their company's goals anddirection.andP;  For example, if a department needs the memory and processingcapabilities of loose networked PCs running under OS/2, it will want toreplace its 8088-based PCs.andM;For the Farm Credit Administration in McLean, Va., the changeover from thefirst generation of personal computers to the next will be a multiple-phaseundertaking.andP;  Bill Cassidy, chief of the administation'sinformation-processing division, is converting from Digital Equipment Corp.'sRainbow series, which he says DEC generously describes as &quot;a mature product.&quot;andO;Cassidy is replacing the DEC machines with IBM compatibles so that employeescan run Oracle's database add-in for 1-2-3 on their PCs, under Oracle'sSQL*Net software, which connects the PCs to the administration'sminicomputer-based data.andP;  The Oracle software won't run on DEC Rainbows.andM;So what will cassidy do with a couple of hundred cast-off system? First, theRainbows will be passed on to staff members who are without personalcomputers.andP;  Next, some systems will be cannibalized for spare parts, sinceDEC no longer makes the Rainbow.andP;  Finally, Cassidy will try to get areasonable trade-in on new equipment for any remaining Rainbows, but he's notoptimistic about this possibility.andP;  The used-computer brokers he's spokenwith seem to regard the Rainbow as the PC equivalent of the Edsel.andM;The brokerage connectionandM;Nonetheless, as more people like Cassidy find themselves having to deal withsurplus hardware, a rapidly evolving used-computer market is emerging.andM;A growing number of computer brokerage firms will refurbish your usedequipment and resell it to students, used-equipment dealerships, and smallbusinesses.andP;  Often, a used-computer broker will throw in equipment warrantiesand national service contracts to sweeten the deal.andM;Cliff Linsey, a vice president with Dataquest, a market research firm in SanJose, Calif., says the way the computer-brokerage process works is similar tothe way IBM used to manage trade-ins on its typewriters.andM;IBM set up a refurbishing assembly line alongside its new-machine productionand developed an active marketing program for the used gear throughoffice-machine dealers.andP;  For years, IBM was the best-selling typewriter.andP;  And&quot;the second-best seller,&quot; says Lindsey, &quot;was a used IBM.&quot;andM;Other companies are jumping on the trade-in bandwagon.andP;  For example, PacTelInfosystems recently instituted its own up-to-$1,400 trade-in offer on Compaqcomputers and has &quot;customized&quot; IBM's trade-in promotion to includecertification of used equipment at the user's site.andP;  Hewlett-Packard has anintriguing offer: a $100 trade-in on its DeskJet printer, plus $10 toward theshipping cost, if you mail in your old dot-matrix clunker.andM;However, before you decide to trade in your old equipment or hand it over toa broker, you'll want to find out its market value.andP;  This isn't as easy as itsounds because the used-computer market is quite volatile.andP;  Discounts, salesto employees, and trade-in offers all contribute to a confused pricingpicture.andP;  But the following sources should help you find out what your oldPCs are worth.andM;The Newman Computer Exchange (Ann Arbor, Mich., 313-994-3200) prints amonthly catalog; the Boston Computer Exchange puts out the &quot;BoCoEx Index onUsed Computers,&quot; published weekly in Computerworld and PC Week; and OrionComputer Blue Book (Orion Research Corp., Durango, Colo., 303-247-8855) ispublished annually and costs $19.95.andM;Take the deductionandM;If you decide that trading in or brokering your old PCs is more trouble thanit's worth, or if you have a philanthropic urge, you may want to considerdonating any excess equipment to a nonprofit organization and taking the taxdeduction.andM;However, the tax rules relating to charitable contributions of property areextremely complex, advises Mike Devejian, manager of tax compliance at LotusDevelopment Corp.andP;  The deduction you can take for donated equipment oftendepends on the type of equipment, what you used it for, and who's getting it.andO;For example, the allowed deduction may be greater if the equipment was usedoriginally for research and development or the donation will be used for thecare of the ill or the needy.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
