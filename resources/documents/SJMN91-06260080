The part, a nine-foot de-icingattachment, is considered a vital clue in the investigation into what causedFlight 2574 to crash Wednesday, on its way from Laredo to Houston. Three crewmembers and all 11 passengers died.;   Investigators speculated Saturday thatthe de-icing boot fell off because 43 screws were missing from the leadingedge of the plane's stabilizer, a section of the tail that keeps the airplanehorizontal in flight. The sudden loss of the de-icer would stall the tail andcause the plane to nose-dive, officials said. It was found aboutthree-quarters of a mile northeast of the crash site.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PLANE PART COULD BE KEY TO CRASH CAUSE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  National News in Brief  </MEMO><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910916  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  144  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, September 16, 199100260080,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
