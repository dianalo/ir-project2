Boesky scandal, spokesman Larry Speakes said.    Even though the group was set up several weeks ago, its existence wasn't announced until Friday, when Mr. Speakes described a variety of domestic initiatives the administration plans for President Reagan's final two years in office. The announcement appeared designed to call attention to the administration's agenda after it has been diverted for weeks by the Iran-Nicaragua arms-sales scandal.    The insider-trading task force, a cabinet working group headed by Treasury Undersecretary George Gould, will study recent developments in money and securities markets, and review whether the Securities and Exchange Commission &quot;has all the tools it needs&quot; to deal with insider trading, according to Mr. Speakes. The group is expected to report its recommendations to President Reagan in early January.    The task force isn't likely to recommend any sweeping changes, however, because administration officials are still waiting to see how far the current spate of insider-trading cases goes. &quot;It's a little hard to select policy options when we don't know what other shoe is going to drop,&quot; said Treasury Secretary James Baker in a speech before the Chicago Economic Club last week.    Other domestic initiatives the White House is working on include:    --Catastrophic illness initiative. President Reagan will meet with aides today to consider competing proposals by the Department of Health and Human Services and a White House Domestic Policy Council task force.    The department has recommended charging an additional Medicare premium to pay for acute care for the elderly, and providing tax breaks for catastrophic health insurance coverage for people under 65. The task force favors relying more on the private sector instead of expanding federal programs. It has suggested providing vouchers for low-income people to buy insurance from private carriers.    --Budget reform. An administration task force has been looking at the possibility of splitting the federal budget into capital and operating budgets, an idea being promoted by White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan. The group hasn't decided whether to push for such a change, though.    --Keeping America competitive. Initiatives on trade, antitrust, natural gas, trucking and telecommunications deregulation are all being considered.    --Agriculture. The administration is studying ways to change the tendency of current subsidy programs to encourage overproduction.    --Revamping the welfare system. Task forces are putting the final touches on proposals designed to give state and local governments more control over welfare rules. This will be &quot;a top priority in 1987,&quot; Mr. Speakes said.    The president has yet to decide which initiatives he will give a higher priority, according to the White House.    As Mr. Speakes laid out the domestic initiatives, Mr. Reagan said Friday that &quot;we cannot and we will not&quot; allow the Iran crisis to &quot;stop us from getting on with the business of governing.&quot; But Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said yesterday on NBC-TV's &quot;Meet the Press&quot; that until the Iran story is told in full and dealt with, &quot;there's going to be a little paralysis&quot; in the government's ability to handle other issues. </TEXT></DOC>
