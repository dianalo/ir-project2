James E. Olson, chairman and chief executive officer, said the company expects next year to continue boosting earnings and return on equity, but he declined to say by how much.    &quot;We see no signals in the economy that will prevent us from meeting our objectives,&quot; he said.    One analyst, Robert Morris of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America, said executives had given him the impression that ATandamp;T's earnings could grow 10% next year, meaning the company hopes to earn at least $2.05 a share in 1988.    For the nine months of 1987, ATandamp;T had net income of $1.55 billion, or $1.42 a share, on revenue of $25 billion. For 1986, ATandamp;T had net of $139 million, or five cents a share, on revenue of $34.1 billion.    ATandamp;T shares closed Friday at $27.375 a share, up 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    The analysts' meeting, at a hotel in New York's financial district, was considerably more upbeat than the one a year ago, at which ATandamp;T announced a much larger-than-expected $3.2 billion pretax charge to fourth-quarter earnings and 27,400 job cuts.    Presentations at the year-ago meeting were disjointed at best, analysts said, and executives said that despite the job cuts and other restructuring moves, they didn't think ATandamp;T could earn significantly more than $1.26 a share this year.    &quot;It seems clear that your average forecasts of $1.87 per share for 1987 are going to be much closer to the range of possibility than we dared think last December,&quot; Mr. Olson told analysts Friday.    He said ATandamp;T remains committed to gaining credibility in the computer market and will work to maintain its No. 1 position in the markets of long-distance phone service, office switchboards and phone switches sold to telephone companies.    Analysts said they thought that ATandamp;T has a better strategic focus than it had a year ago and that Mr. Olson clearly wants to lift earnings next year by growing revenue instead of just cutting costs.    But some analysts worried that Mr. Olson's statements about getting relief from profit regulation for its long-distance business may hurt ATandamp;T's chances of gaining such relief. Analysts say they believe that a proposed change in regulation -- capping ATandamp;T's prices instead of its profit -- will enable the company to earn significantly more money.    Mr. Olson said he didn't believe ATandamp;T needed to promise any up-front concessions, such as a big price reduction, to the Federal Communications Commission to get relief from profit regulation. &quot;We've given up an awful lot already,&quot; Mr. Olson said. &quot;I really don't see any quid pro quo necessary.&quot;    &quot;If Olson thinks they won't have to give anything back, then . . . (that) will guarantee they won't get&quot; the relief the company seeks, said John Bain of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. Indeed, one senior FCC official said last week that the agency isn't happy with ATandamp;T's current proposal on price caps and that the FCC wants to have a method that would guarantee that long-distance prices will continue to decline under such regulation.    Last week the House's two most influential lawmakers on telecommunications expressed reservations about the price-cap proposal. ATandamp;T executives said Friday that they expected such a reaction from the lawmakers and that the company's public-affairs people think the FCC will be able to satisfy congressional concerns. </TEXT></DOC>
