FlexCache 25386Z with8M bytes of RAM.andP;  Each version was installed on the PC Week Labs 3Com NetBIOSnetwork.andP;  Printing was evaluated on network-connected Hewlett-Packard Co.andO;LaserJet Series II and Apple Computer Inc. LaserWriter II printers.andM;In the Ventura tradition, both packages continue to offer a popular, richarray of features.andP;  The DOS/GEM and Windows releases both include full WYSIWYpage rendition, a wide variety of text import and export filters, support formany popular graphics file formats, dynamic pagination, automatic hyphenationand powerful typograhical controls.andP;  In addition, the newest versions includeProfessional Extensions, previously sold separately.andP;  The extensions includean equation package for building extensive mathematical equations and afeature to help create complex tables.andM;With its Network Server, Professional Extensions also provide multiple userswith access to Ventura.andP;  Each user is given installation options, includingmonitor and mouse type as well as a choice of Extensions options.andM;Multiple users can read the same document simultaneously but are restrictedfrom making changes.andP;  The DOS/GEM version also includes a memory-resident,1.2M-byte English hyphenation dictionary.andP;  The Windows version uses thetraditional rules and hyphenation exceptions.andM;Windows users cutting their teeth on Ventura will find the program awell-behaved Windows application.andP;  However, Ventura could benefit fromWindows 3.0's dynamic data exchange.andP;  If a change is made in the originaldocument, it isn't updated in Ventura until the file is either loaded backinto ventura or the Ventura document is closed and reopened.andM;Both versions require some sort of upper memory.andP;  The Windows version needs2M bytes of extended memory, and the DOS version needs 256K bytes of expandedmemory (1M byte of expanded if using the hyphenation dictionary in theDOS/GEM version).andM;The DOS/GEM version ran certain tasks considerably faster than than Windowsversion.andP;  Loading a 40-page text file took only 17 seconds on the DOS/GEMversion, whereas the Windows version took 36 seconds.andP;  Windows compensatesfor this by beign able to switch to other applications with a click of themouse.andP;  With DOS/GEM Ventura, however, users must completely leave theprogram to use another application.andM;In desktop publishing, it's common to move among word-processing, graphicsand page-layout applications.andP;  Certain functions take longer, but movingamong applications in Windows is little more than switchingapplications--much faster than unloading, loading and unloading in DOS.andM;By the same token, DOS/GEM Ventura is not subject to the inherent, flaws ofWindows 3.0.andP;  For example, even if another printer is selected in the WindowsControl Panels, Ventura as well as other Windows applications, continues touse the original printer.andP;  Although Windows Ventura can read DOS/GEMdesktop-published files, which the company calls chapters, DOS/GEM can't readWindows chapters.andM;Windows Ventura, of course, works with about 150 printers supported byWindows.andP;  The DOS/GEM version supports only 13 printers, but these representa fairly broad cross-section of de facto protocols, such as PostScript andthe LaserJet.andP;  Also, many of the Windows printer drivers are inappropriatefor desktop publishing.andM;Both packages can import the same word-processing and graphics file types.andO;The word-processor and graphics file types.andP;  The word-processor files includeASCII, WordStar, Multimate, Microsoft Word 5.0, WordPerfect 4.0 and 5.0,XyWrite and IBM's DCA format.andM;The vector-graphics formats supported by DOS/GEM and Ventura Windows includeGEM, AutodCAD, Lotus PIC, Macintosh PICT, HPGL, CGM, Encapsulated PostScriptand Videoshow vector-graphics file formats, as well as non-bit-mapped imagessupported Clipboard files.andP;  Bit-mapped images supported include Dr. halo DPE,PC Paintbrush PCX, MacPaint and TIFF file formats.andM;Ventura Software Inc., of San Diego, can be reached at (800) 822-8221.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
