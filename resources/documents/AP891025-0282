MARTINEZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business News</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mobil Corp.'s plan to trim its U.S. explorationand production business reflects an industry-wide trend towardbolstering their shrinking reserves by boosting overseasexploration, analysts said Wednesday.   Mobil's announcement on Tuesday followed similar restructuringsearlier this year by other major oil companies, including TexacoInc., Amoco Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp.   Mobil, the nation's second-largest oil company after ExxonCorp., said in its third-quarter earnings report that it had takena $40 million provision for the restructuring costs.   The oil giant said it planned to transfer and terminateemployees over a two-year period ``to reduce costs and focusefforts in areas where the projected financial returns are mostattractive.''   Details of the reorganization were not immediately available,but Mobil spokesman John Lord said an announcement was planned forFriday.   ``Mobil has been selling off a great number of small propertiessince the early 1980s,'' Lord said. ``This (restructuring) is partof that.''   Analysts familiar with Mobil's strategy said the announcementwas not a surprise given the general industry trend to cut U.S.drilling costs and focus exploration overseas, where theprobability of finding large reserves is greater and financialexposure is lower due partly to more favorable tax and royaltyrates.   ``We're going to see more and more announcements by othermajors,'' said Paul Ting, analyst with the investment firmOppenheimer andamp; Co.   Low crude oil prices over the last few years and heavyexploration costs in the United States have discouraged manycompanies from pumping more money into domestic oil drilling.   Crude prices have hovered in the $18 to $20 a barrel range inrecent months, and as low as the $12 range last year.   More importantly, analysts say, the U.S. oil patch may be nearlybone dry, with little oil left outside of the Gulf of Mexico,Alaska and offshore California. The last major U.S. oil find was inthe late 1960s in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska.   Industrywide, domestic production fell by more than 500,000barrels a day during the first nine months of this year comparedwith a decline of about 200,000 barrels a day during 1988.   ``Basically, the U.S. has been drilled over for oil. The largedeposits are in geologically hostile areas or off limits due toenvironmental concerns,'' said Philip J. Kehl, an analyst with DeanWitter Reynolds Inc.   Most oil companies, including large independents, arereshuffling assets abroad because of declining U.S. output, Kehlsaid.   ``Areas outside the U.S. are considered a more cost-effectiveuse of oil drilling funds,'' he said.   In 1986 Mobil announced a major restructuring of its upstreamoperations _ exploration and production _ as part of anindustry-wide shakeout due to plummeting oil prices.   Last March, Texaco announced the reorganization of its U.S.upstream operations into two regions as part of an overallrestructuring to increase the company's profits worldwide. The moveincluded the streamlining of regional and divisional offices andtrimming of management.   Amoco followed with an announcement in late March that it wascutting its U.S. exploration and production workforce by 800. Amocosaid at the time that its domestic operations would continue toshrink through divestment of marginal and non-strategic propertieswhile international activities would grow.   Occidental continued the trend in recent weeks with theannouncement that it had ceased all U.S. exploration and wasexpanding its drilling overseas.</TEXT></DOC>
