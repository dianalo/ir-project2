<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-27-0569 </DOCNO><TEXT>Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and x-ray absorption spectroscopy(XAS) were used to characterize components involved in the light reactionsof photosynthetic reaction centers from spinach and a thermophilic cyanobacterium,Synechococcus sp.: center X, the low electron potential acceptor in PhotosystemI (PS I) and the Mn complex involved in water oxidation and oxygen evolution.The dependence of its EPR amplitude on microwave power and temperatureindicate an Orbach spin relaxation mechanism involving an excited stateat 40 cm{sup -1}. This low energy contributes to its unusually anisotropicg-tensor. XAS of iron in PS I preparations containing ferredoxins A,B and X are consistent with a model with [4Fe-4S] ferredoxins, whichare presumably centers A and B and [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins, which wouldbe X. Illumination of dark-adapted Synechococcus PS II samples at 220to 240 K results in the formation of the multiline EPR signal previouslyassigned as a Mn S{sub 2} species, and g = 1.8 and 1.9 signals of Fe{sup2+} Q/sub A/{sup -}. In contrast to spinach, illumination at 110 to 160K produces only a new EPR signal at g = 1.6 which we assign to anotherconfiguration of Fe/sup 2+ - Q{sup -}. Following illumination of a S{sub1} sample at 140 K or 215 K, the Mn x-ray absorption edge inflectionenergy changes from 6550 eV to 6551 eV, indicating an oxidation of Mn,and average valences greater than Mn(II). Concomitant changes in theshape of the pre-edge spectrum indicate oxidation of Mn(III) to Mn(IV).The Mn EXAFS spectrum of PS II from Synechococcus is similar in the S{sub1} and S{sub 2} states, indicating O or N ligands at 1.75 +- 0.05 A,transition metal neighbor(s) at 2.75 +- 0.05 A, and N and O ligands at2.2 A with heterogeneous bond lengths; these data demonstrate the presenceof a di-{mu}-oxo bridged Mn structure. 202 refs., 40 figs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
