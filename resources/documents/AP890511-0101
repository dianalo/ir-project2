The original 40-horse hitches were developed at the turn of thecentury to advertise the circus and at the time, he said, ``It wasthe most spectacular thing they could do.''   Sparrow is putting together a modern version of the big hitch,and the Zearing farmer says it's still spectacular. ``Sometimes Ialmost get mind boggled by it,'' he said. ``I wonder, am I in overmy head?''   After months of training the animals, Sparrow gave them apractice spin today on a 300-acre plot on the Sparrow farm.   ``It went off real well,'' said his wife, Sandy Sparrow.   Sparrow said the last time family attempted a 40-horse hitch wasin 1977, when his father, Dick, did it.   Since then, sponsoring money ran out, the Sparrows sold theanimals and went back to farming.   ``We went all over the country, Rose Bowl, coast to coast,''said the son.   Now, thanks to a $120,000 grant from General Foods Corp., theSparrows assembled a new team. The grant covers expenses oftraining and transportation to the only planned public appearance,the Great Circus Parade in Milwaukee in July.   Sparrow, 34, said it takes patience and practice to arrange theanimals correctly.   ``It's like assembling a football team,'' he said. ``Someanimals are interchangeable and some aren't.''   Hauling the wagon takes just a fraction of the horsepoweravailable, meaning there's more than enough energy to causetrouble, Sparrow said, especially in a crowd.   ``There's no way you can make them crowd proof, but you do thebest you can.''   Sparrow said the animals are trained to think nothing of it whena balloon pops nearby or a band blares or a car horn sounds.   ``When you stop, you have to stand there and not get spooked,''he said. ``We drive right up to them in cars with the hornblaring.''   Sparrow said he can shout loud enough for the lead animals, 115feet away, to hear the commands, but the hitch requires two pairsof mounted outriders as well. One pair flanks the lead animals andthe other is midway.   ``We had a 4-year-old one time who darted right toward the hitchand would have gone under if it hadn't been for one of theoutriders cutting him off,'' Sparrow said.   What if an animal midway in the pack wants to bolt right and thecommand is to hang a gradual left? Not to fear, he said, the otherhorses will provide the correct influence.   ``If one horse doesn't want to turn, the others will push himand he won't have any choice.''</TEXT></DOC>
