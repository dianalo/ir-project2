The increase in a roof'ssurface temperature due to insolation increases the building's heat gainduring the summer and reduces its heat loss during the winter. This studyexamines this counteracting influence on annual HVAC energy use. Thereport reviews pertinent background and presents computed changes inheating and cooling needs obtained using the computer code, DOE 2.1B.All computations were made corresponding to a reduction in a flat roof'ssolar absorptance from 0.8 to 0.3. They were made for two different buildingsusing TMY weather data for twenty cities within the United States; theywere also made for a third building using weather data for five US cities.Computed annual changes in building heating and cooling energy use arepresented in the form of bar charts for each location. Calculations weremade for three different roof insulation levels. The change in annualenergy use caused by the reduction in solar absorptance decreases withincreased roof insulation. This effect is depicted graphically for representativecases. Incorporating realistic HVAC system performance and using a particularenergy cost scenario based on use of natural gas for heating and coolingvia an electrically driven unit, the best cost savings occurred for locationsin the Southwest and were equivalent to approximately the costs of 1Kw-hr of electrical energy per square foot of flat roof surface. 16 refs.,18 figs., 29 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
