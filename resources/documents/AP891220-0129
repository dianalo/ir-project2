The letters may be an important clue in the FBI's investigationof the parcel bombs that killed Judge Robert S. Vance, a member ofthe 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, and Robert E.Robinson, a Savannah, Ga., alderman and civil rights lawyer, saidFBI spokesman Greg Jones.   ``We are examining those letters to try to determine whether ornot there is a link between those threats in August and the mattersat hand today,'' Jones said.   One letter declaring war on the 11th Circuit was received Aug.24 by WAPT-TV in Jackson, Miss., the station reported Tuesday night.   Similar letters were received that month in Minneapolis,Milwaukee and California that made threatening statements againstother federal appellate circuit courts, Jones said.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement Tuesdaythat the investigation is focusing on the possibility that racemotivated the killings and the sending of similar package bombs tothe 11th Circuit and the NAACP in Jacksonville, Fla.   Vance ruled in favor of the Jacksonville NAACP on Sept. 15 in aschool desegregation case.   The letter received in Jackson bore an Atlanta postmark datedAug. 21, the day before a tear-gas cannister exploded in thatcity's NAACP office, injuring eight people. Jones declined todescribe the postmarks on the other letters, except to say theywere sent in late August.   All four letters were examined by the FBI laboratory inWashington but yielded no further physical clues, such asfingerprints, Jones said. U.S. Marshals in the variousjurisdictions were told of the threatening letters, Jones.   The letter attacking the 11th Circuit threatened poison gasattacks on large cities to force the court to ``adopt fair andimpartial treatment of all.''   Entitled ``Declaration of War,'' the letter said the 11thCircuit ``does deliberately and wrongfully refuse to fulfill itsobligation to protect the innocent.''   ``The court's failure to render impartial and equitablejudgments is due to rank bias and the mistaken belief its victimscannot effectively retaliate,'' the letter said.   The Jackson television station said it immediately turned theletter over to the FBI.   Three weeks after the letter surfaced, the 11th Circuitpublished Vance's opinion for the unanimous three-judge panel inthe Jacksonville school case. It reversed a lower-court ruling thatJacksonville schools could stop busing to achieve racialintegration.   On Saturday, Vance was killed in his Mountain Brook, Ala., homeafter opening a parcel mailed to him.   On Monday, a similar bomb was found at the 11th Circuitcourthouse in Atlanta and removed without incident. Hours later,Robinson was fatally injured in his Savannah law office when heopened the parcel mailed to him.   On Tuesday, authorities found a similar bomb at the office ofthe Jacksonville NAACP, which brought the school case.   FBI Director William Sessions told reporters Tuesday he wouldnot be surprised if the Vance murder was related to cases he hadworked on as a federal appellate judge.   Sessions said Vance's court docket would be carefully studied todetermine if his rulings may have sparked a racially motivatedmurder.   Sessions implied that the bureau did not have a suspect, andindicated there might be more than one perpetrator.   ``As far as I know there's been no claimant of responsibility atall,'' Sessions said at a news conference at the Justice Department.   Sessions said investigators found no similarities between thebomb incidents and the actions of extremist white groups but ``itis something you cannot rule out.''   ``We would hope the patterns of these types of groups whenstudied carefully and compared will yield fruit,'' Sessions said.   Asked about racial motivation, Sessions said: ``When the NAACPheadquarters receives a suspicious package, an alderman is killed,you have to have that in the back of your mind.''   The package containing the bomb that killed Vance bore thereturn address of another 11th Circuit judge, Lewis F. Morgan, agovernment source said in Washington.   Morgan, who had previously sent packages to Vance, is not asuspect but the evidence suggests that the killer was familiar withthe two judges' friendship, said the source, who spoke on conditionof anonymity.   Thornburgh called the incidents ``an affront to our nation'scommitment to the rule of law'' and said he had assured civilrights leaders the case would be thoroughly investigated.</TEXT></DOC>
