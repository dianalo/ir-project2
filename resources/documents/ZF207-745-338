 957-74, including Dissent and Response to theDissent-Ed.).andP;  When the martial law was introduced in Poland in December,1981, I was interned (detained without charge) in a prison camp near Warsaw.andO;At that time, I was employed as a Teaching and Research Assistant ,at theInstitute of Informatics, Warsaw University.andP;  I was released from internmentin May, 1982.andP;  1 was greatly moved to see my name and those of my colleaguesin jack Minker's report (&quot;Computer Professionals Whose Scientific Freedom andHuman Rights Have Been Violated,&quot; 1982-communications, December 1982).andO;Considering the difficulties with passing the information about human rightsabuses from Poland to the West at that time, it was surprising how timely andaccurate the report was.andP;  The report helped me in keeping my job and later,in obtaining a passport and leaving Poland to pursue doctoral studies in theU.S.andM;While in this country, I read the third report on human rights prepared byjack Minker (&quot;Computer Professionals Whose Scientific Freedom and HumanRights Have Been Violated,&quot; 1984-Communications, Jan.andP;  1985).andP;  To the best ofmy knowledge, the information about Poland contained in this report wascomprehensive, detailed, accurate and up-to-date.andM;It is extraordinary that the enormous task of gathering, confirming,compiling, and regularly publishing extensive data about abuses of humanrights of computer professionals has been performed since its inception 10years ago by a single person, jack Minker.andP;  I am personally grateful for hisunyielding efforts, and I would like to commend him very highly for thisunique service to the world computer science community.andP;  I am sure that aslong as he is in charge of the ACM reports, computer professionals all aroundthe world can feel quite a bit safer.andM;Jan Chomicki ACM Student Member University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, NC27599andM;As a person mentioned several times in the reports of the ACM Committee onScientific Freedom and Human Rights, I would like to express my seriousconcern about the &quot;dissenting report&quot; (Communications, August 1989).andM;I can understand the barely concealed irritation of the authors of thedissenting report by the fact that most of the 144 persecuted individualswere Jews.andP;  Indeed, as some of the Soviet officials had told me(unofficially), &quot;there are too many Jews here&quot;; this &quot;just one group&quot; (p.andO;972) has clearly been overrepresented.andP;  Moreover, I do understand that &quot;thesignificance and reliability of information&quot; obtained from such &quot;externalsources&quot; as &quot;various Soviet Jewry committees&quot; might be consideredquestionable by the dissenting report authors: the &quot;missions&quot; of theseorganizations are &quot;very different from ACM's.&quot; Of course, &quot;it is notreasonable to expect such passionate advocates to provide impartialevaluations of the individual cases&quot; because both the committees and theindividuals &quot;can hardly be expected to maintain their detachment.&quot; If theauthors of the Report would just base it on the detached and impartial Sovietgovernment information, the dissenting report would probably never have toappear.andM;In my case, I was contacted many times by various people, including membersof the subcommittee, in order to verify the citations in question.andP;  Althoughneither I nor persons who got in contact with me, violated any written Sovietlaws, these contacts were often extremely difficult to arrange because then,and even now, information from the USSR was scarce and difficult to obtaindue to multiple unwritten (i.e., secret) Soviet regulations.andP;  However, forall individuals known to me the information published in the Reports of theCSFHR was correct to the best of my knowledge.andM;I had spoken out there when I encountered such behavior of Soviet officialsfrom KGB and other impartial bodies, and I am not willing to remain silenthere.andP;  1, as a Jew, will never forget that 6 million Jews and some 50 millionnon-Jews were killed as a result of impartial observation of the activitiesof one of the governments.andP;  More recently, the world impartially observed themurder of an unknown number of people, including probably some computerscientists, by the progressive and humanitarian government of Pol Pot.andP;  It isdifficult to understand why sincere and noble attempts to help the governmentpersecution victims have become the cause of irritation and hatred.andM;I am happy to express once more my gratitude and admiration to all themembers of ACM who supported me in difficult times, and expecially tothemembers of CSFHR Daniel McCracken, jack Minker, and Anthony Ralston.andM;Haim Kilov 40 Court Street Apt.andP;  2 Morristown, NJ 07960andM;Don't Quote Me, But .andP;  .  .andM;Thank you for publishing my letter entitled &quot;Why is it difficult to writeabout programs?&quot; in the June 1989 issue of Communications (p.andP;  675).andM;However, a somewhat unfortunate typesetting error happened there in themiddle of the first full paragraph of the second column.andP;  One sentence in mymanuscript read like this:andM;Thus nobody gets confused when I write, &quot;My name is Markku Sakkinen&quot;,although really my name is 'Markku Sakkinen' and I am Markku Sakkinen.andM;but was printed as follows:andM;Thus nobody gets confused when I write, &quot;My name is Markku Sakkinen,&quot;although really my name is Markku Sakkinen and I am Markku Sakkinen.andM;The sentence pretty much loses its sense if read literally; I was a littlepuzzled by some comments sent by James Fetzer via e-mail before I had seen acopy of the publication of his letters (see Forum, Communications, June 1989,p.andP;  676; Aug.andP;  1989, p.andP;  921).andP;  still, most people who are really interestedin these questions presumably will deduce that some error of this kind hashappened.andP;  It is probably not worthwhile to publish a correction a couple ofmonths after the original has appeared, especially as this is not animportant technical paper.*andM;Markku Sakkinen Department of Computer Science University of JyadskylaSeminaarinkatu 15 SF-40100 Jyvaskyla Finland Electronic mail address:andM;markku@jytko.jyu.fi (Bitnet: SAKKINEN@FINIYU)andM;In partial answer to the letter by Markku Sakkinen in the June Forum, I use anotation which clearly distinguishes natural language from identifiers.andP;  Tomy best knowledge, this &quot;naming standard&quot; was developed by Charles Simonyiand used at Microsoft Corporation sometime around 1981.andM;The philosophical basis of the standard is to name data and functionsaccording to type.andP;  The names that result are composites of primitive &quot;typetags.&quot; Since the tags are short, and few, they are very easy to remember.andO;Few type tags are required even in large programming projects since most dataand functions have composite semantics.andM;To make these identifiers distinguishable from natural language one ought notto use natural words as type tags.andP;  As composites of type tags, identifiersare clearly not natural language, and their dereferencing and context remainclear.andM;For example, a pointer to an array of task control blocks would be named&quot;prtcb&quot;; &quot;p&quot; abbreviates &quot;pointer to,&quot; &quot;r&quot; abbreviates &quot;array of,&quot; and &quot;tcb&quot;is a nonstandard application-specific tag for &quot;task control block.&quot;andM;Some frequently seen tags are:andM;px pointer to an xandM;ix index of an xandM;rx array of x'sandM;sc counted stringandM;sx size of, in bytesandM;w &quot;word&quot; size integerandM;fl floating pointandM;cx count of x'sandM;dx delta, or step size of an xandM;f flagandM;sz zero terminated stringandM;ch character, usually asciiandM;I &quot;long&quot; integerandM;dfl double floating pointandM;Identifiers of the same type in the same scope can be distinguished byappending qualifiers: e.g., pchfst, pchlst.andM;Some standard qualifiers are: t (temporary), 0, 1, 2, etc., fst (first), 1st(last),* * nxt (next), prv (previous), max (maximum value), min (minimumvalue), mac (maximum current value), Qualifiers are omitted when possible.andM;A programming group can add tags and qualifiers to the standard, for specificpurposes.andM;Function names are analogous; some favorite verb tags are get, put, init, Iok(lock), and ulok (unlock), cpy.andP;  Inverse operations are generally prefacedwith a  &quot;u.&quot;andM;The standard I know has probably mutated from Simonyi's; all errors here aremine.andM;I really hated this standard untill saw programmers produce identicalidentifiers, without talking to each other.andP;  I have not seen other namingstandards remove this communication burden.andM;We have used the standard successfully in C, assembler, and FORTH, and oldcode remains clear, short, and comprehensible.andP;  I do not have to remembernames and their semantics, and text searches for identifiers rarely land incomments.andM;The lecture on transition logic was fascinating.andM;Ray Van De Walker 1782 Nisson Rd., #60 Tustin, CA 92680andM;&quot;Not to be confused with 1st,-Ed,andM;Get GraphicandM;In the Turing Award interview in the June 1989 issue of Communications (pp.andO;711-18), Ivan Sutherland says that a visual display of a program's structuremight help people understand the program, but he did not have any suggestionsas to what programs look like.andP;  I propose a less ambitious visual aid: theinclusion of figures in source programs.andP;  They would enhance understanding inthe same way as do figures in technical papers.andM;I am a graphics programmer, so sketches of geometric entities are importantas I develop the ideas in my programs, and inclusion of these sketches in thesource would be worth &quot;a thousand words&quot; of alphanumeric comments.andP;  Thehardware capabilities of most modern printers, workstations, and even manyvideo display terminals allow the printing and display of one-bitper-pixelraster images.andP;  Desktop publishing systems provide software for mixing textand images, but current source editors and compilers would choke on suchmixtures.andP;  I hope that designers of future software engineering systems willconsider the utility of graphical annotations to source text.andM;Nelson Max Professor, Department of AppliedandM;Science University of California, Davis Davis, CA 95616andM;Drop ChargesandM;I found the column by Larry Press, &quot;Thoughts and Observations At TheMicrosoft CD-ROM Conference&quot; (Communications, July 1989 issue, pp.andP;  784-88)to be very informative and well written.andM;The column mentions that Hewlett Packard is considering making CD-ROMdocumentation the default and charging the customers extra for supplying thepaper version.andP;  I feel that a &quot;customer friendly&quot; approach would be to permitusers to print out individual pages, sections, chapters, etc.andP;  at their owndiscretion.andP;  This would permit customers to optimize their documentationcosts according to their requirements.andM;Amol Khedkar Dept.andP;  of Computer Science Florida Atlantic University BocaRaton, FL 33431andM;Popular StandardsandM;X3J3 has voted the second draft of the 8x Fortran Standard out of committee.andO;Public review is scheduled from July 27 to November 24.andP;  The documentdistributors are unable to ship a copy of the draft as of July 27.andM;For the first Fortran 8x public review, there was hardly any PR and reviewerswere charged $50 for a poorly-printed draft standard.andP;  To the best of myknowledge, this was the first time ACM had not distributed a draft standard.andO;I understand that ACM did not distribute so that CBEMA could be paid $25 percopy.andP;  I think ACM should distribute draft standards for the followingreasons:andM;* ACM has a quality track record inandM;giving previous draft standards wide distribution.andM;* ACM distribution does not requireandM;as much additional advertising.andP;  Lahey Computer Systems is making a copy ofthe draft standard available for $23 per copy, including shipping via UPSsecond day.andP;  We will begin shipping August 21.andP;  We are doing this for thefollowing reasons:andM;* The standard is a volunteer effortandM;whose goal has never been to raise funds for a worthy cause.andM;* The standard is typeset at noandM;charge by an X3J3 committee member.andM;* Limiting distribution of draftandM;standards to those willing to pay large (circa $50) sums is in directopposition to the goal of producing the best possible final standard.andM;* Many comments of the first publicandM;review were critical of the print quality of that document.andM;* WG5 resolution I6 asks that draftandM;standards receive the widest possible distribution.andM;I hope future draft standards are distributed by ACM.andM;Thomas M.andP;  Lahey, President P.O.andP;  Box 6091 Incline Village, NV 89450-60911-800-548-4778andM;Leave Home Without ItandM;I am writing to protest mildly some overly-assertive use of the Association'sname, and some hard-sell marketing.andM;In the past several months, I have received several offers from theAssociation to sign up for a Gold Mastercard (or whatever it is), sponsored(or whatever) by the Association.andP;  I already have too many credit cards, andI long ago decided that the effort required to evaluate each new offer (I getmany every month) to determine whether or not to replace an existing one isnot worth the expected payoff.andP;  So I open these letters from you, see whatthey are, and throw them away.andP;  Getting five or six of these is only a slightannoyance.andM;This evening, however, I got a telephone call from someone claiming to befrom the &quot;Association of Computing Machinery.&quot; Assuming that he meant theACM, I pointed out that he had the name wrong.andP;  He grunted, obviously eagerto get on to the rest of his script.andP;  He then began to tell me of the gloriesof this Gold Mastercard (or whatever it is).andP;  I interrupted, politely Ithink, to say that I had already gotten the offer several times in the mail,and was not interested.andP;  Rather than politely hanging up, which is the RightThing to Do in those circumstances, he challenged me to tell him What WasWrong with his wonderful offer.andP;  It became clear that he was not with the ACMat all, but was with whatever bank it is that actually provides the thing.andP;  Ieventually convinced him that he was wasting his time harping at me, and he&quot;thanked&quot; me and hung up.andM;If it is at all possible, I would rather NOT be bothered by pushy salesmenwho do not know when to Go Away.andP;  I am VERY well aware of the ACMwhatever-it-is offer, having thrown it away several times in the mail.andP;  Theimplication that perhaps I do not know how to read mail, and that I mightenjoy being called by a pushy salesman and harped at, is not flattering.andP;  Ialready pay Lots of Money to belong to the ACM.andP;  I would rather not besubjected to annoying telephone calls as an additional cost of membership.andM;David M.andP;  Chess 3215 Lake Front Drive Mohegan Lake, NY 10547andM;Afterthought: I am not really complaining about the doubtless underpaidhireling that called me.andP;  I object to being called by ANY salesperson, givenall the times you have sent me the same offer by mail.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
