<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-21-0296 </DOCNO><TEXT>A number of photoabsorption processes can be explained and calculatedefficiently by adopting a state-specific point of view for the electronicstructure of atomic and molecular ground and excited states. This viewputs emphasis on the separate and appropriate choice and optimizationof the function spaces describing the zeroth order and the remainingpart of the N-electron wave-functions, especially in excited states.Analysis of the photoabsorption amplitude leads to a consistent understandingof the interplay between the atomic structure and the dynamics of photoabsorption.As applications, cases of extraordinary photoabsorption phenomena arediscussed, including the so-called giant resonances, as well as the recentlydefined and computed Wannier two-electron ionization ladder (TEIL). 40references, 3 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
