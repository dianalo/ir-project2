After the construction of such largetokamaks as TFTR, JET and JT-60, many investigations have been done toevaluate the various candidate materials facing plasma, and now iso-graphiteand C-C composite were picked as the best materials for tokamaks withoutnuclear reaction and burning. Now, the feasibility of graphite and C-Ccomposite under 14 MeV neutron irradiation environment must be evaluated.The key properties in applying bulk graphite to CIT and ETR are heatconductivity, thermal expansion, degasing, strength and fracture toughness,and the data on the irradiation effect of these properties are availablefor CIT condition, but not always applicable to ETR. The apparent advantageof carbon fiber-carbon matrix structures for fusion energy applicationis obvious. The serious problem is the ability to withstand the damagedue to 14 MeV neutrons. C-C composite must be investigated under CITand ITER irradiation conditions. The international effort should be developedin view of efficiency and cost to execute the research.
