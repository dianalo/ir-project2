Dan Howard, the spokesman, said a preliminary investigationsuggests either an electrical or mechanical glitch in the part ofthe missile that swivels the rocket nozzles from side to side.   ``And we do believe that we have the necessary data to be able toevaluate it and pinpoint the problem, even without the recovery ofthe vehicle,'' Howard said.   ``We do have further launches scheduled. At this point, there areno plans to delay or alter that planned launch program. And we stillexpect that the Trident 2 will be fully operational aboard the USSTennessee in December.''   The investigation began Tuesday, shortly after a Trident 2missile fired from the submarine Tennessee self-destructed fourseconds after launch. The missile popped to the surface as plannedand the first stage ignited properly, but the missile then beganspinning like a burning pinwheel and exploded.   It was the first submarine launch of the Navy's newest and mostpowerful weapon.   According to Howard, the missile's first-stage rocket nozzles aresupposed to swivel immediately after firing to put the weapon on a19-degree angle of flight. Another internal command is then sent tothe nozzles to straighten back up, thus maintaining the missile's19-degree angle.   In this case, the spokesman, the radio telemetry discloses thesecond command to the nozzles to straighten was sent but notexecuted.   ``They do not know yet whether the difficulty is in theelectrical system, that that signal did not get from the sendingpoint to the receiving point, or if the difficulty was simplymechanical, that a pump didn't operate correctly or whatever,'' hecontinued.   ``In any event, (the nozzles) did not correct. So the missilecontinued in that pitchover maneuver, round and round in circles.And as it did so, it generated G-forces internal to the missile,''triggering a self-destruct safety system, he said.   Howard declined to predict how long it would take technicians toisolate the cause of the failure.   The three-stage Trident 2 is a more lethal version of the weaponthat is the heart of America's naval nuclear deterrent, the Trident1. The new missile can deliver three to 12 nuclear warheads toindividual targets up to 6,000 miles away.   The Trident 1 experienced similar test failures but still wasdeployed on schedule, Howard noted Thursday. After 19 test launches,the Trident 1 had worked only 13 times compared to 16 for theTrident 2, he said.   The Navy says the new weapon is much more accurate than itsundersea predecessors _ Polaris, Poseidon and Trident 1 _ and canmatch the targeting ability of land-based missiles even though it islaunched from a submerged, moving submarine.   The Tennessee is the first of nine submarines equipped to carry24 of the deadly missiles.</TEXT></DOC>
