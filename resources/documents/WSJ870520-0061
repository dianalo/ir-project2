The unit, Norfolk andamp; Western Railway, is reviewing the use of 455 miles of line that it leases from Wheeling andamp; Lake Erie Railway, which is itself a unit of Norfolk andamp; Western. The track under consideration is a northeastern Ohio general merchandise line.    Indicating that the line is under-utilized, a Norfolk Southern spokesman noted a trend in the railroad industry toward selling track line to smaller, lower-overhead operations that might be able to operate the lines more efficiently.    Norfolk Southern controls 17,000 miles of rail line.    The spokesman said that under certain conditions, a sale of rail line would be subject to federal regulation.    The spokesman declined to put a value on the 455 miles of line. </TEXT></DOC>
