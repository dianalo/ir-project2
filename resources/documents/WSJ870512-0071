In the year-earlier period, the maker of military equipment and ice cream had an $821,000 loss on revenue of $23 million. But the company is much larger now through acquisitions such as General Defense Corp., which makes munitions parts. For the year ended Jan. 31, 1986, Clabir had revenue of only $57 million, compared with $421.4 million in fiscal 1987.    A spokesman for Clabir said he expects the company to pay dividends of about $3.3 million to shareholders in the fiscal first-quarter. He wouldn't give any other reasons for the anticipated loss or say whether Clabir's businesses would show a profit from operations in the quarter.    Clabir's chairman and chief executive officer, Henry D. Clarke Jr., told securities analysts yesterday that &quot;we expect that our net income will increase (in fiscal 1988), although the dividend requirements of our preferred stock are such that it is unlikely we will report&quot; per-share common-stock earnings. That is partly because the company has shed an investment portfolio that provided interest and dividend income, Clabir said.    In fiscal 1987, Clabir earned $7.2 million, or two cents a share. Earnings in fiscal 1989, he added, &quot;will provide substantial&quot; per-share earnings after &quot;providing for the dividend on our preferred stock.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
