Some examples are given concerning the evaluationof a solar plant with heliostats and central receiver, and of an energyconservation system through renewable energy utilization and the simulationand the optimization of a combined solar-wind-batteries-diesel motorpower production system. The simulation technique is then extrapolatedto the simulation and optimization of energy politics in a multisectorialeconomical context.</TEXT></DOC>
