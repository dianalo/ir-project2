GreenbergerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/14/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LATAMAEROSPACE (ARO)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Reagan administration unleashed a new weapon in its fight to win more aid for the Nicaraguan Contras: a senior-level Nicaraguan defector who claims that the government in Managua continues to build a massive military machine and meddle in its neighbors' affairs.    The administration is hoping the information will help tilt the balance in Congress in favor of aid to the rebels. A partial test could come as early as this week, when House and Senate conferees consider a Senate-approved provision that would give the Contras &quot;non-lethal&quot; aid. The administration plans to push for military aid early next year.    In press interviews arranged by the State Department, Roger Miranda, a former major in the Sandinista Popular Army and chief of the Nicaraguan Defense Ministry's secretariat, said Nicaragua's Sandinista government plans to build a 500,000-man active and reserve military force, about double the current size. Further, Mr. Miranda, who defected in October, said Nicaragua agreed in September to provide Soviet-made SA-7 anti-aircraft missiles to leftist guerrillas in El Salvador. That was one month after Managua signed a regional peace plan.    Mr. Miranda also said Managua expects the Soviet Union to deliver 12 MiG-21 aircraft to Nicaragua by 1991 and has requested from Moscow, among other items, 12 Mi-25 HIND helicopters and 24 Mi-17 helicopters, according to a State Department summary of interviews by U.S. officials and by several news organizations.    U.S. officials already knew much of that information. But the first-hand account by a former senior Sandinista official who had access to secret planning documents and was present at top-level meetings will help dramatize the administration's case that the Nicaraguans, with close cooperation from the Soviet Union and Cuba, are building a military arsenal that poses a threat to their neighbors.    A U.S. official said interviews with national news organizations were arranged &quot;to make a maximum impact on Congress.&quot; The administration also has videotapes of some interviews with Mr. Miranda.    Nicaragua's defense minister, Humberto Ortega, brother of President Daniel Ortega, in effect confirmed some of the information. In what may have been an effort to pre-empt Mr. Miranda, Mr. Ortega said in a speech in Managua over the weekend that Nicaragua was planning to build a 600,000-man army -- an even higher figure than Mr. Miranda used -- by 1995. And he said Nicaragua had the right to defend itself with East-bloc hardware against U.S.-sponsored aggression.    It isn't certain whether Moscow would supply Managua with MiG-21 aircraft. Several years ago, the U.S. warned that it wouldn't permit the introduction of these fighter aircraft into Nicaragua, and Moscow has ignored previous Nicaraguan requests for MiG-21s.    Speaking yesterday on ABC's &quot;This Week with David Brinkley,&quot; Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, President Reagan's national security adviser, reiterated these warnings. &quot;I would suggest it would not be in the interest of U.S.-Soviet relations, and it would not be in the best interest of the people of Central America for such weapons to be introduced in that region,&quot; he said.    Mr. Miranda's revelations aren't expected to derail the regional peace negotiations currently under way. Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, author of the plan, already has expressed skepticism about Managua's intentions, but he insists peace would be the best way to take away the Sandinistas' excuse to expand their military machine and curtail domestic civil liberties. </TEXT></DOC>
