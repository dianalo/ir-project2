It is necessaryto develop and present a method which can fulfil maximal requirementsto an optimal extent. For this, the most suitable method is a systemof assessment as in the polydimensional method of assessment matrixes.As primary solution measure for assessment, an assessment matrix is developedwith 10 different single criteria, primarily dealing with all aspectsof mining requirements, which are assessed by point values p from 0-5and evaluation factors f from 1-5 according to the significance of thecriterium for the three different types of planning (t = technical-economical,s = security-ergonomical, g = orientated to fundamentals and future)which must be specially regarded and evaluated. The second step of theprocedure deals then with the evaluation of the assessment results tocreate a plausible order of priorities which can be assimulated at anytime. With the help of six different computation methods, the evaluationresults of seven different evaluators for 18 research and developmentschemes are put into order of priority, during a trial-run, as decisionassistance for the decision-makers.
