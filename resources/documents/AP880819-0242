He said at a weekly briefingthat the talks will focus on Cambodia and will be led by SovietVice Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev and his Chinese counterpartTian Zengpei. The meeting is expected to last several days.   ``The Chinese will be in a listening mode,'' said one Westerndiplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``They'll be waitingto see what the Soviets have to offer.''   He said the Chinese remain skeptical about a quick solution tothe Cambodian conflict. He added, however, that if Moscow andBeijing can come to terms on Cambodia, there would be ``a lot ofmovement toward the normalization process'' of Chinese-Sovietrelations.   Moscow is the main backer of Vietnam in its 9-year-old militaryoccupation of Cambodia. Beijing is chief supporter of the communistKhmer Rouge and the other anti-Vietnamese resistance forces inCambodia.   Communist Vietnam has pledged to withdraw 50,000 troops, orabout half its force in Cambodia, this year and the rest by early1990.   Both China and the Soviet Union have expressed support for apeaceful political solution in Cambodia. They are expected to seekways to bring about a Vietnamese withdrawal without leaving thenation vulnerable to a takeover by the Khmer Rouge, who launched areign of terror during their 1975-78 rule.   Although it has supported the Khmer Rouge, China has agreed thatthe group should not dominate a future coalition government. ButChina also rejects Vietnam's attempts to link its militarywithdrawal to dismantling Khmer Rouge forces.   The Beijing meeting could also help shape the future ofChinese-Soviet relations.   China stresses that it will fully normalize political relationswith the Soviet Union only when the Kremlin takes action to endVietnam's presence in Cambodia.   Ties between the two communist giants have been strained sincethey split over ideological and strategic differences in the early1960s.   Political normalization talks have gone on since 1982, butbogged down with China's objecting to Soviet military strength onthe common border, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and Cambodia.   The Communist Party general secretary, Zhao Ziyang, toldJapanese journalists Tuesday that the first Chinese-Soviet summitmeeting since the breakdown of relations was possible if Moscowfirst urges Vietnam to leave Cambodia.   The Western diplomat estimated that at least a 50 percent chanceexists that 1989 will see a Chinese-Soviet summit, which probablywould bring Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to Beijing to meetChina's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping.</TEXT></DOC>
