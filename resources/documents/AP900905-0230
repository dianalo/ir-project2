Gold prices moved higher in most world trading centers.   Heavy dollar selling began in Asia and carried over into laterEuropean and U.S. dealing.   The sales were triggered by speculation that the Federal Reservesoon might seek to foster a U.S. economic rebound by pushinginterest rates down. Falling U.S. rates would reduce returns ondollar holdings and lessen investment interest in dollars.   Currency dealers said the dollar also was hampered byspeculation that West Germany and Japan soon may raise theirinterest rates. Higher rates in those countries, especially if U.S.rates go down, would tend to spur demand for marks and yen.   Commenting on the dollar's selloff, analyst David Marshall ofMMS International said, ``I think on the whole it was a lot ofspeculation about the Fed easing. There was speculation about U.S.rates moving down and other rates moving up.''   Financial markets are awaiting the government's monthlyunemployment report, due Friday, for indications of the economy'scondition in August. Evidence of new softening in the labor marketwould bolster the case for the central bank to loosen its monetarypolicy.   Remarks Wednesday by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that theUnited States will regret involvement in the Middle East appearedto have only a minor impact on the dollar. If the Persian Gulfsituation stokes inflation and stalls the U.S. economy, the dollarwould suffer.   One of the most pronounced moves of the day was the dollar'sdrop against the yen. It was quoted at 141.65 yen late in New Yorktrading, down from 143.40 on Tuesday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollarfell to a closing 142.30 Japanese yen from 144.05 yen at Tuesday'sclose and in London it fell to 141.75 yen.   The British pound gained against the dollar. Sterlingstrengthened in New York with a pound fetching $1.9055 in latetrading, compared to $1.8810 Tuesday. In London, the British poundrose to $1.8990 from $1.8750 late Tuesday.
