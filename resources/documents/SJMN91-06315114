George M. Cohan died on Nov. 5, and it was also the day the firstColonial post office was set up, in Boston. How do you like them apples?;  Those dates, and the bit of 1930s slang, come from two of the five HyperCardstacks, or collections of data, that make up Writer's Dreamtools, by SlipperyDisks of Los Angeles.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Computing  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  FLURRY OF FASCINATING FACTS FILLS HYPERCARD STACKS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Software  </MEMO><TEXT>     Anybody who cranks out copy on a Macintosh, either professionally or as astudent, should find the set a source of inspiration and amusement. It is alsoa treasury of factoids, those gems of information that make a piece of writingseem more authoritative and better-researched than it really is.;   When thechips are down (1940s slang), Writer's Dreamtools may not be the greatestthing since sliced bread ('50s), but it is pretty far out ('70s).;   Forinstance, a copywriter trying to add a touch of verisimilitude to anadvertisement aimed at rural residents might write, &quot;You don't have to knowthe difference between a disk harrow and a snap machine to shop at Smythe's,but it helps,&quot; without, in fact, knowing the difference between a disk harrowand a snap machine.;   The names of the tools were taken from the Stack ofLists. This stack contains more than 600 lists of people, places and thingsfrom academic degrees -- STD, Doctor of Sacred Theology -- to Zoos --Riverbanks, Columbia, S.C.;   For other jobs, one might resort to the Stack ofDecades. This provides a card for every decade back to the 1650s.;   Each haslists with the headings Who Was In, What Was In and Major Events, as well astrends and events in art, music, literature, entertainment, the media,religion, science and medicine, money and fashion and beauty.;   There arealso lists of bad guys, notable deaths and slang expressions and buzz wordsthat originated in the decade. A writer of material for retired people,himself a child of the hubba-hubba or high-five eras, might make knowingreferences to Ouija boards, pleated skirts, George White's Scandals and otherartifacts of the '20s. You can say that again, as they often did then.;   TheStack of Lists and the Stack of Decades are new to Writer's Dreamtools. Thethree other stacks have been enlarged or updated for version 2.0.;   Beware:The Slang Thesaurus and the Dictionary of Cliches and Catch Phrases includewords and expressions not generally acceptable in polite company, whereverthat is these days.;   Events Day-by-Day is just what the name suggests, andyou will not be able to resist looking up your birthday. On mine, Nat (King)Cole was born and Marcus Aurelius died, though neither in the same year.;  Writer's Dreamtools was prepared by Larry Belling, who has enjoyed a longcareer as a publicist, writer and producer of commercials. His 42-page manualis a model of its kind, and it should be helpful to HyperCard experts andbeginners alike.;   The program comes in two forms. Writer's Dreamtools is thefull set of disks, plus HyperCard 2.1, and it eats up about 4.4 megabytes ofspace on a hard disk.;   Student's Dreamtools omits the slang and clichestacks, with their naughty words, and requires 2.9 megabytes. Neither willwork on a floppy-only Macintosh.;   The full set is $149; the student one is$89. Individual disks are sold without the manual or the HyperCard program for$35, or $49 for the Stack of Lists. They may be ordered from Heizer Softwareof Pleasant Hill by calling (800) 888-7667. More information is available fromSlippery Disks at (800) 522-7234.; EXPLOITING VIRTUAL MEMORY: If you haveupgraded your Macintosh to System 7, as I did recently, you discovered thatthe 2 megabytes of internal memory that recently looked like more than enoughis indeed cramped.;   Pulling down the &quot;About This Macintosh&quot; box under theApple logo at the upper left of the menu bar brings the information that thesystem alone takes 1.209 megabytes of memory at start-up and grabs more as youwork. That does not leave much room for anything else.;   The easy butexpensive solution is to add more memory. A stopgap solution is to devote partof the hard disk to virtual memory, memory that the system treats aselectronic though it is actually mechanical.;   Virtual memory is noticeablyslower than real memory, sort of like looking up a telephone number that youhaven't memorized. Call up the Control Panel, which is also under the Applelogo, and then double-click on the Memory icon.;   There is a good discussionof Mac memory, and much more, in Sharon Zardetto Aker's &quot;The MacintoshCompanion. The Basics and Beyond&quot; (Addison-Wesley; $22.95).  </TEXT><BYLINE>  L.R.
