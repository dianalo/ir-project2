Application of the correlations betweenspectral and structural values allowed one to conclude, that many spectralproperties of Nd/sup 3+/ aqueous solutions, crystallohydrates and waterlesssalts are explained by coordinational polyhedron configuration and theclosest surrounding composition. Based on the spectra recorded, absorptionband oscillator strengths which significanly increase under transitionfrom aqueous solution to crystallohydrate, are calculated.</TEXT></DOC>
