The treaty, which requires the elimination of medium-rangenuclear weapons, has been stalled by a number of issues, mostrecently the question of whether futuristic weapons are banned bythe pact.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said a failure to ratifythe treaty by the time Reagan meets with Soviet leader MikhailGorbachev May 29-June 2 would be a setback to ongoing negotiationsto curb strategic nuclear weapons under a so-called START treaty.   Fitzwater said that to have the medium-range weapon treatyratified before the summit ``would be an important boost to ournegotiations on the START treaty.   ``Similarly, if it's not (ratified) it would tend to dampen, Ithink, the prospects for serious START progress. It would not behelpful and we would hope that the Ccongress would be able toratify it before we go.''   The treaty is not expected to come to the Senate floor until May9 at the earliest, leaving only 2{ weeks before Reagan's departure.   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said Tuesday that the question aboutfuturistic weapons is still unanswered despite a statement by a topSoviet official.   ``I think the question still needs clarification and there's gotto be some more work done on this issue,'' he said.   Fitzwater said the issues raised in the Senate ``are allimportant and they certainly deserve clarification. We believe theyhave received it.''   The administration argues that the treaty will not affectdevelopment of futuristic weapons.   As Nunn expressed his reservations, the House was voting 393-7in favor of a non-binding resolution approving theIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty.   The vote has no effect on the Senate, which has exclusiveconstitutional authority to ratify treaties.   Nunn commented a day after the State Department forwarded to theSenate the transcipt of a letter by Soviet Foreign Minister EduardA. Shevardnadze to Secretary of State George P. Shultz.   In the letter, Shevardnadze said the Soviets agree with theUnited States that the INF treaty signed last Dec. 8 bans``futuristic weapons'' such as lasers or beam weapons.   The treaty eliminates existing missiles with a range of 300 to3,400 miles, but Nunn and other senators have questioned how thepact0would affect weapons in that range0dlatcoumd be1d</TEXT></DOC>
