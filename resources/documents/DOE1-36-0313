<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-36-0313 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new dose assessment model, called RASCAL, has been written for the USNuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for use during response to emergencies.RASCAL is designed to provide rough estimates of the health effects froma radiological accident in progress and only limited information is available.RASCAL will be used by the NRC personnel who report to the site of anuclear accident to conduct an independent evaluation of dose projections.It was written to correct the technical and operational problems in NRC'sprevious model and to be more appropriate to the personal computers presentlyin use by the NRC. The model has been constructed to be easy to modify,with separate modules for estimation of the quantity of radioactivityreleased, its transport through the atmosphere, and the resulting radiologicdose to man. RASCAL results can be displayed in graphical or ASCII form.4 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
