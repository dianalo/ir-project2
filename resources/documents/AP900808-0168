SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. warplanes and combat troops, backed by anarmada of Navy ships, have taken up defensive positions in and nearSaudi Arabia, U.S. military officials said Wednesday. Some AirNational Guard units were called up for active duty.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney described the deployment as ``amajor commitment of U.S. forces'' that included elements of the82nd Airborne Division and F-15 fighter jets. He declined toprovide specifics, citing security concerns.   Terming the military situation ``uncertain'' after IraqPresident Saddam Hussein's ``act of infamy'' in invading Kuwait,Cheney indicated American forces could be in the region for months.   About 5,000 ground troops and more than 100 F-15 fighter planeswere ordered to the region, congressional and Pentagon sourcesreported, and 4,000 Marines were said by diplomatic sources to havebeen moved close to the Saudi-Kuwait border. Nearly 40 warships andescort vessels _ some armed with sophisticated cruise missilesprogrammed to destroy specific Iraqi targets _ will be in Mideastwaters by next week, the sources said.   What was announced in Washington was evidently only part of thestory. Reports of other troop movements arrived throughout the day.   Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey announced in Trenton that the170th Air Refueling Group of his state's Air National Guard hadbeen called up. Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York said his state's 105thMilitary Airlift Group, which flew transport missions in theinvasion of Panama, had been called to active duty with hisagreement.   Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., said A-10 air-to-ground attack jetsfrom Myrtle Beach Air Force Base had left for Saudi Arabia. Unlikethe F-15, an ``air superiority'' fighter designed to tangle withother planes, the A-10 was designed to attack ground targets, andits six-barrelled 30mm anti-tank cannon has been described as thebest anti-tank weapon in the world.   Diplomatic sources in Saudi Arabia said 4,000 U.S. Marines hadbeen deployed at Khafji, a Saudi oil-terminal town on the borderwith Kuwait. It was not known where they came from, though Marineshad been based at Diego Garcia, the U.S. island bastion in theIndian Ocean about 1,500 miles away.   One of the diplomatic sources said the U.S. ground commitmentwould be 30,000.   The movement of troops, ships and planes will take ``severaldays at least,'' said one Pentagon source early Wednesday evening.   This source, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted that mostof the 82nd Airborne Division was still in the United States. Hedid not, however, say how much of the division would be moved toSaudi Arabia.   The build-up appeared to be going well without majordifficulties, the source said.   At present, two aircraft carriers bristling with 80 to 90aircraft each are within striking distance of Iraqi targets.Another is on the way.   ``Our purpose ... is to deter any further Iraqi aggression,''Cheney said. He said he expected other nations to join the militaryeffort but declined to name any except Britain.   ``The mission of the armed forces is to take up defensivepositions,'' said Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the JointChiefs of Staff.   Powell expressed confidence American sailors, soldiers andairmen were prepared for battle in the hostile, desert environmentif called upon.   ``We've trained for it, we've exercised in it,'' he said.   And while Iraq's million-man army has been hardened by itseight-year war with Iran, he said, ``They are not invincible. Theyare not ten feet tall.''   Cheney and Powell briefed a packed room of reporters in thePentagon, standing in front of a map of the Saudi region thatidentified some of the major U.S. units that had been deployed, butnot all of them.   Asked for information on U.S. troop movements or the size of thesudden deployment, Powell replied simply: ``You can be sure thatfor the mission we have been given we will put in adequate forces.''   Cheney and Powell said the aircraft carrier USS Independence andits support ships have taken up positions just outside the PersianGulf and the carrier USS Eisenhower is in the Red Sea _ not farfrom the end point of an Iraqi oil pipeline and within range forthe carrier's aircraft and other weapons to engage Iraqi forces.   Powell said the troops brought with them protective clothing andmedical supplies to be used in the event Iraq uses chemical weaponsagainst the American forces.   The briefing came after President Bush delivered a nationallytelevised address announcing his decision to send U.S. forces intothe tense Persian Gulf region.   Pentagon sources said the U.S. arsenal will include heavy tanks,dispatched aboard Marine supply ships from the secret U.S.facilities on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia. Othersupplies were en route from Guam, in the Pacific, the sources said.   The battleship Wisconsin, steaming across the Atlantic with theaircraft carrier Saratoga, had 32 Tomahawk cruise missilesprogrammed to destroy specific Iraqi targets, sources said.   And a second Navy cruiser has been added to the Navy's taskforce in the Persian Gulf, bringing the number of U.S. ships in thestrategic waterway to nine.   Powell and Cheney added that the aircraft carrier Eisenhower,accompanied by the warships Scott and Ticonderoga, had gone throughthe Suez Canal on its way to the scene.   Five AWACs, Airborne Warning and Control aircraft, sold to theSaudis in the late 1970s, had been put on station in central SaudiArabia, they said.   Cheney said his discussion with the Saudis on a quick visitearlier this week had also resulted in Bush's waiver of acongressional limit on the transfer of F-15 fighter jets to SaudiArabia, permitting a dozen of the sophisticated aircraft to beshipped to the kingdom.</TEXT></DOC>
