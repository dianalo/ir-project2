The meeting began after 6 p.m. (12 noon EDT), more than threehours late, lasted two hours, and adjourned until 10 a.m. (4 a.m.EDT) Sunday.   OPEC will try to decide whether to change an agreement among 12of its 13 members to limit output to 15.06 million barrels a day.The agreement, which was extended in December and expires June 30,was designed to support oil prices at $18 a barrel.   Iraq did not join in the pact, insisting on a quota equal toIran. The two nations have been at war since September 1980.   Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister, was elected OPEC president foranother six months in a vote taken at the start of the firstsession. He assumed the post in June 1986 and has been re-electedat every meeting since then.   Fernando Santos-Alvite, Ecuador's oil minister, was re-electedvice president.   Pessimism about the possibility of the cartel reaching agreementon a new accord has depressed the oil markets, pushing prices wellbelow the target.   The spot price of North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely tradedinternational crude oil, fell 52 cents to $15.85 a barrel onFriday. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, dropped42 cents to $16.865 on the spot market.   A Venezuela-led group has wanted to cut production to push oilprices up while Saudi Arabia leads other OPEC members who want toraise output or at least hold it steady to maintain the cartel'smarket share.   Industry analysts believe OPEC is so deeply divided that it willextend its current agreement for three or six months.   But late Saturday, Venezuela appeared to have softened itsposition.   Its oil minister, Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, said, ``I am notsure we have the unanimity to reduce the production level.   ``Anyway, if we maintain the current level of production, Ibelieve that prices will start going back up'' because of anexpected increase in demand in the second half of the year.   Saudi Arabia has wanted to increase oil output to take advantageof that anticipated increase in demand.   The Iran-Iraq war remains a major problem.   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqhazadeh said his countrycouldn't guarantee that it would continue to accept a quota, whichcurrently stands at 2.369 million barrels a day, if Iraq, which isproducing 2.6 million barrels a day, continued to refuse to accepta quota.</TEXT></DOC>
