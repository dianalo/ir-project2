The agency was responding to criticism that it is takingtoo long -- an average of 10 to 12 years -- for Superfundsites to be cleaned up. Other reports have complained thattoo much of the money the EPA pays to private contractors tooversee cleanup projects goes for administrative expenses,including in some cases such non-essentials as potted plantsand a Christmas party.</LP><TEXT>   EPA Administrator William Reilly said he hopes to cut twoto three years off the average cleanup time.   He vowed to make more efficient use of the 23 engineeringconcerns under contract with the EPA to do Superfund work andmore vigilantly audit their bills to the government. Althoughan EPA task force found no fraud in what the companies havebilled the government, Mr. Reilly called some of the paymentsinappropriate and said the agency would try to &quot;jawbone ourcontractors to agree to removal of some of the costs.&quot;   Among charges questioned by EPA investigators are a $1,600bill for a Christmas party, $150 a month for plant rental,and rent for an apartment to house out-of-town employeesvisiting a contractor's office. The EPA looked intocontractors' charges after a report in June by the WashingtonPost. The agency's report said such costs are a smallfraction of the $265 million the government has paid itscontractors since they signed on in January 1988.   A bigger problem is that there is less work than expectedfor all the companies the government signed on. Thegovernment is directing less of the cleanup work thanexpected because it has been successful in forcing morepolluters to pick up the tab and hire contractors themselves.   But there appears to be little way of getting out of thecontracts without incurring big penalties. Mr. Reilly saidthe agency may terminate a couple of the 45 contracts,presumably for poor performance. But he indicated it isn'tconsidering breaking off its 10-year contracts.   Mr. Reilly vowed to hold contractors' overhead costs toabout 20%, compared with 25% this past fiscal year, but stillless than a 15% target contemplated by some congressmen.Overall, some $6.3 billion has been spent on Superfund sitessince 1980; 63 cleanups have been completed so far.   Mr. Reilly said the EPA plans to standardize some of itscleanup techniques to shorten the planning process. He alsosaid he hopes polluters will agree to begin cleanup work oncethey strike an agreement with the EPA, rather than waiting upto two years for a formal court order.   The tougher management measures were unveiled by Mr.Reilly the day before Congress launches hearings into avariety problems with the Superfund program, which has beenunder attack since it was launched in 1980 to handleabandoned hazardous-waste dumps.</TEXT></DOC>
