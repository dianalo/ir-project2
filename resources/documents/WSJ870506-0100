The agreement, reached last week, replaces two secured agreements, the first of which expired last Wednesday and the second of which was to continue until April 29, 1988.    The new agreement allows Allegheny, a consumer and industrial products concern, and its finance and realty subsidiaries to borrow up to $375 million.    Like the earlier agreement, the new one prohibits payment of dividends and requires Allegheny to maintain certain levels of tangible net worth and working capital, as well as to satisfy a specified ratio of current assets to current liabilities.    Allegheny, which has struggled the past two years under heavy debt and mounting losses, said it was already negotiating with Mellon to extend the agreement, which was set to expire 21 calendar days after any termination of Allegheny's merger agreement with Sunter Holdings Corp., a unit of First Boston Inc.    As previously reported, the merger agreement was canceled Monday, and followed a failed tender offer made by Sunter for Allegheny that expired April 23. Sunter had offered to take Allegheny private in a transaction valued at $500 million. </TEXT></DOC>
