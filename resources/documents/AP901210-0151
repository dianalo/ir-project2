Both sides accepted the invitation of the director of theFederal Mediation and Conciliation Service to meet with him.   Negotiations have been going on since the beginning of the yearon contracts that expired in March. The talks with the unionscontinued after the strike began Oct. 25 amid violence.   James F. Power, a spokesman for the mediation service inWashington, said, ``Right now we feel quite happy we are gettingthem under the same roof. There's no way to say how these thingsare going to evolve.''   The Allied Printing Trades Council, the umbrella of the nineunions striking the paper, is to meet with the service's director,Bernard DeLury, Wednesday. DeLury will meet separately withmanagement.   The News says that by the end of this year its losses over thepast decade will have mounted to about $200 million and that itmust have major concessions to operate profitably. The unions saythey might be able to grant some relief but that the ``managementrights'' provisions sought by the paper are too broad.   The board of the Tribune Co., the Daily News' parent company,was scheduled to meet Tuesday in Chicago to discuss the strike.Also Tuesday, a U.S. Senate hearing will be held in New York on theissue of hiring replacement workers during a strike, said Sen.Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.   On Monday afternoon, Gov. Mario Cuomo, the Rev. Jesse Jacksonand Cardinal John O'Connor addressed a union rally of 6,500 acrossthe street from the paper's offices. Police reported no incidents.   ``The whole world is watching us ... as they watched Eastern. Ithas to come out better this time,'' Cuomo said, referring to theunion struggle of the strikers at Eastern Airlines.   The paper has printed daily since the strike began, although itscirculation has dropped from 1.09 million to 552,000 as of lastweek. The use of more than 1,600 hawkers has helped the Daily Newsregain some of the circulation lost when large numbers of vendorsrefused to sell it.   In another development Monday, unions representing transitworkers said they would make sure the paper's hawkers complied withrestrictions placed on them by a judge in allowing them to sell theDaily News on subway platforms.   U.S. District Court Judge Miriam G. Cedarbaum ordered that therebe no more than three hawkers at each station and that they remainwithin 10 feet of any existing newsstand, newspaper rack ornewspaper vending machine not displaying or offering the News.</TEXT></DOC>
