West Germany is elated over East Germany's opening of itsborders a week ago as well as over promises by the rulingCommunists in East Berlin of easing state control with sweepingpolitical and economic reforms.   With an offer of massive financial assistance that has stringsattached, the Bonn government is seeking to encourage the process.Yet it is trying hard not to invite charges it seeks to destabilizethe East German leadership.   Mikhail S. Gorbachev said this week that ``exportingcapitalism'' could hurt the growing climate of cooperation inEurope and also reaffirmed the Soviet Union's opposition to anysuggestions of German reunification.   Juergen Chrobog, spokesman for Foreign Minister Hans-DietrichGenscher, said interfering in East Germany's internal affairs isthe furthest thing from Bonn's intentions.   ``We don't want to interfere and take advantage of a weakenedgovernment. We must give them time to develop,'' he said Wednesday.   A group of officials from eight federal ministries has sinceMonday been holding closed-door sessions to consider how to bestsupport East Germany's reform processes in the long term.   The group has been working on a ``catalog'' of possible ways tohelp East Germany, said chief government spokesman Hans Klein.   Officials said the ideas included short- and long-term economicassistance and how such aid could be best carried out.   Improvements in cooperation in the areas of transportation,telephone communications and environmental projects were alsodiscussed.   West German officials are also considering setting up a specialfund to finance improvements in East Germany and to help EastGerman visitors get the convertible currency they need to travelWest, Bonn government sources said.   Klein said Rudolf Seiters, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief ofstaff, would discuss the ideas with East German Communist Partychief Egon Krenz in East Berlin on Monday.   Klein also indicated Kohl might postpone a crucial summit withKrenz until after an emergency Dec. 15-17 congress of EastGermany's Communist Party that could choose a new party leadership.   West German government officials make no efforts to concealtheir uncertainty over where East Germany is headed.   ``Concerning long-term help, we have to have discussions withthem to find out what their needs are, what their problems are. Wedon't even know what they want,'' said Chrobog.   ``Herr Seiters will go there (East Berlin), and when he comesback we will make decisions,'' said Chrobog.   Bonn has been sending out unclear signals on how much financialassistance it will pledge.   On Saturday, Kohl told reporters economic assistance to EastGermany cannot be successful unless the ``system of a state-plannedeconomy'' gives way to a ``socially responsible market economy.''   Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann on Tuesday said a massiveeconomic aid program for East Germany should be contingent uponconcrete economic reforms.   Genscher on Tuesday said Bonn should not set conditions for itsaid but that the reform process in East Germany must show``definite signals.''   Volker Ruehe, general secretary of Kohl's Christian Democrats,said Wednesday that some assistance could be offered to EastGermany soon, including an overhaul of East Germany's troubledtelephone communications network and environmental projects.   But Ruehe said ``far-reaching changes in the current economicsystem'' are needed for East Germany to be able to attractdesperately needed private investment.   East Germany's state-run news media as well as the country'smain opposition group, New Forum, have indicated wariness over WestGermany's intentions.   New Forum has expressed concern Western capitalists mightexploit an unstable East Germany without helping its people. Andthe country's news media have warned against a ``sellout'' to WestGermany.   But Klein rejected any suggestion that West Germany wanted toimpose its own type of economic system on its Communist neighbor.   ``We export a lot of things, but not capitalism,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
