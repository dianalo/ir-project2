The FDIC arranged for the insured deposits of North Central National Bank, Austin, Texas, to be transferred to another institution. The other failed bank, Osceola State Bank andamp; Trust Co., Osceola, Iowa, is to reopen today as a newly chartered institution.    The insured deposits held by North Central National, closed yesterday by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, are to be available immediately from Greater Texas Bank North, Austin, Texas. The FDIC arranged the transfer because the agency received no bids to buy the failed bank.    North Central National had assets of $23.3 million and held deposits of $22.2 million in 1,900 accounts, including $76,000 in 100 accounts that exceed the federal deposit insurance limit of $100,000 for each depositor. Holders of the uninsured deposits will share the proceeds from the liquidation of the failed bank's assets proportionately with the FDIC.    Greater Texas is to reopen North Central National's office today as a branch. North Central National was the 21st bank to fail in Texas this year.    Osceola State, closed yesterday by state authorities, is to reopen as American State Bank, a newly chartered subsidiary of Osceola Bancorp., also of Osceola. The failed bank had assets of $9.5 million and held $8.4 million in 2,200 deposit accounts.    Osceola State was the fourth Iowa bank to fail this year. </TEXT></DOC>
