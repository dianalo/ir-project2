The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. says it now controls 165failed Sandamp;Ls in 25 states after taking action Thursday in Texas,Illinois, Louisiana, Florida and Oklahoma. It hopes to assumecontrol of about another 60 in the next month.   The agency is going into the sickest Sandamp;Ls with the goal ofminimizing losses while the administration waits for Congress toappropriate the money to shut them down or sell them to new buyers.   Bush, in a luncheon speech in Houston, said Congress should getmoving. ``There's no excuse for delay,'' he said, urging legislatorsto meet his challenge to pass the reform package 45 days from Feb.22, when it was delivered to Congress.   Sen. Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate BankingCommittee, announced Thursday that his committee plans to act on anSandamp;L bill by April 14 and is pressing for a full Senate vote by April21, which is after the 45-day deadline expires earlier that month.   ``We're going as fast as we can within the bounds of doing thejob properly,'' Riegle said.   In the House, the subcommittee with jurisdiction over Sandamp;Ls plansa vote by April 14 with a vote by the full Banking Committee tofollow soon after. However, nearly a half dozen other Housecommittees are claiming jurisidiction over part of the bill and thatmay delay a vote by the full House.   In other developments:   _Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House BankingCommittee, said he will push to strip from the Bush Sandamp;L proposal aprovision for the automatic reappointment of M. Danny Wall as thenation's top Sandamp;L regulator.   _The Senate Finance Committee endorsed the nomination of David W.Mullins Jr., one of the architects of the administration's Sandamp;L plan,to a senior Treasury Department post. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,D-N.Y., said the full Senate could confirm Mullins as assistantsecretary for domestic finance as early as today.   _An internal report of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,summarized in a House Banking Committee memo, cited five exampleswhere Sandamp;L regulators in Dallas may have given preferential treatmentto influential members of the industry.   _Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., complained in a letter to TreasurySecretary Nicholas F. Brady about efforts by Sandamp;L regulators to sellrepossessed property in Europe.   Bush, in his reform legislation, is proposing to wrap the bankboard into the Treasury Department, reducing the three-member boardto just its chairman. The legislation specifies that Wall, a closeally of Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, senior Republican on the SenateBanking Committee, would continue as head of the agency.   Gonzalez, at a private meeting Tuesday of House Banking CommitteeDemocrats, said he would offer an amendment to the Bush bill thatwould force Wall to be reconfirmed by the Senate.   The bank board report on the Dallas regional bank was finishedlast spring as part of the agency's peer review process, where theperformance of regulators in each of the 12 districts is beingreviewed by colleagues from the other districts.   The regional banks are controlled by industry-chosen boards ofdirectors, although the boards are supposed to have no influenceover Sandamp;L examiners and supervisors policing institutions in theregion.   However, according to the banking committee staff, the agency'speer review criticized the Dallas bank for five incidents``involving what appeared to be preferential treatment of boardmembers.''   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for the bank board, said peer reviewswere begun about a year ago because ``there was a recognition thatthe system needs to police itself and tighten up its operation.'' Hesaid the reviews are heeded and in some cases ``have resulted inmajor personnel changes.''</TEXT></DOC>
