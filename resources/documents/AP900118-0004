(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The battle to keep Florida'senvironment off the terminal list gets a boost this week, asPresident Bush plans a visit to the Everglades and leadingconservationists meet to set their agenda.   Heavily populated South Florida is under mandatory waterrestrictions because of its worst drought in three decades, andstate environmentalists say time is running out for ambitious,expensive efforts to reverse damage caused by runaway growth.   ``The Everglades is on the critical list. It is the mostthreatened ecosystem in the United States,'' said Brien Culhane, aWilderness Society official and chairman of the EvergladesCoalition. ``The 1990s will be the decade of decision. Thedecisions we make _ and our success in carrying them out _ willdetermine whether the Everglades will be saved.''   The Everglades Coalition, an umbrella group of 25 organizationsthat includes the National Audubon Society, Sierra Club andWilderness Society, begins its fifth annual meeting Thursday. Aftersessions with Florida's top politicians, seminars, and field trips,the conservationists will announce their agenda for the year.   Meanwhile, Bush plans a tour and briefing Friday at EvergladesNational Park. The main purpose of Bush's six-hour Florida visit isto keynote a fund-raising dinner in Miami for Republican Gov. BobMartinez's November re-election effort, but Martinez likely willlobby Bush for federal money to help Florida environmental projects.   The governor is expected here Thursday to endorse anunprecedented, $276 million backfilling plan to restore theKissimmee River to its original, meandering boundaries.   The Army Corps of Engineers, because of state calls for floodcontrol, built a 52-mile, 30-feet-deep channel to straighten thewinding 98-mile-long river. But after the channelization wascompleted in 1971, pollution of Lake Okeechobee, the majorreservoir of South Florida's freshwater, increased and tens ofthousands of pollution-filtering wetlands were lost along withsubstantial numbers of fish and wildlife.   Estus Whitfield, the governor's chief environmental adviser,said the state will ask for 80 percent federal funding of therestoration.   Bush last month authorized expansion of the Everglades NationalPark by 107,600 acres, but state officials want him to pushimmediately for funding. Florida will donate 35,000 acres to thefederal park, and has agreed to pay 20 percent of the estimated $40million cost to acquire the other lands.   ``When you're talking about getting sizable amounts of federalfunds for any activity, that's tough these days,'' said U.S. Sen.Bob Graham, D-Fla.   Graham and other Florida leaders say the state's projects aremore than environmental idealism.   Adding wetlands and reversing development not only would protectthe 13 endangered species and dozens of threatened species, butalso could prevent the booming ``Gold Coast'' from Palm Beach toMiami from becoming a concrete desert.   About half of South Florida's 4,000 square miles of wetlandswere taken over by urban areas and agriculture after massivedredging and draining began around the turn of the century.Florida's population exploded after World War II, more thanquadrupling to nearly 13 million people. Canals and channels werebuilt for flood control, but changes in natural water flow havespurred pollution, destroyed wildlife habitats and disruptedevaporation-and-rainfall cycles.   South Florida has had its lowest rainfall since 1962 in the pastyear, and the water level in Lake Okeechobee, which serves as agiant reservoir for South Florida, is three feet below normal andat its lowest on record.   The dry conditions spur wildfires that push black smoke and ashover the southeast coast. Choking smoke last spring forcedrespiratory alerts and repeated closings of major highways. And thelow water levels can allow ocean saltwater intrusion to undergroundaquifers.</TEXT></DOC>
