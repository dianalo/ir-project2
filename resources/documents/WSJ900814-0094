The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.27 to 408.30, a 0.1%gain, buoyed by a late-afternoon rally in the Dow JonesIndustrial Average. OTC volume of 87.6 million shares fellfrom Friday's 112 million shares and decliners led gainers,1,143 to 799. Shearson Lehman's New York trading operations,which typically handle about 17% of OTC volume, were amongthose idled by the downtown power loss.</LP><TEXT>   More than one-third of the workstations servingover-the-counter traders in New York initially were downed bythe power outage, according to the National Association ofSecurities Dealers, which operates the over-the-countermarket.   However, traders in New York and at regional firms acrossthe country said investors remained wary of developments inthe Middle East and largely stayed away from the OTC market.   &quot;Because the market was so quiet, I don't think theblackout had much effect,&quot; said Lance Zipper, head of OTCtrading at Kidder Peabody. Kidder was one of the few New Yorkfirms where OTC trading wasn't halted when a fire at aConsolidated Edison Co. substation in lower Manhattaninterrupted power to much of New York's financial district.   Mr. Zipper said he didn't see any marked increase inbusiness because of the misfortunes of some of hiscompetitors.   &quot;It was quiet before the fire and it was quiet after thefire,&quot; said Mr. Zipper. &quot;There wasn't any business to pickup,&quot; he added. &quot;The market was dead anyway,&quot; agreed E.E.&quot;Buzzy&quot; Geduld, president of Herzog, Heine andamp; Geduld, whosefirm also traded throughout the day uninterrupted.   Nearly 600 terminals serving OTC traders in the New Yorkarea were initially shut down when the substation fireinterrupted service to one of three central NASD computers inthe New York area, according to John T. Wall, NASD executivevice president of marketing operations. By the end of theday, power had been restored to half of those terminalsthrough a backup system based in Trumbull, Conn. NASD has1,457 terminals serving the New York area.   Many firms such as Shearson relayed business to theiroffices outside of New York. Others transferred theiroperations to regional offices of other brokerage firms thatweren't affected, Mr. Wall said. He added that NASD is makingits own trading operations at its offices in Trumbull, NewYork and Rockville, Md., available to market makers whosebuildings remain without power today.   The OTC market's biggest stocks led the day's activity.The Nasdaq 100 Index, which tracks the OTC's 100 largestshares, rose 2.38 to 414.84. Among other strong sectors, theNasdaq Utilities Index gained 2.89 to 557.14.   Insurance stocks were among the day's biggest losers. TheNasdaq Insurance Index fell 2.02 to 470.97.   Sun Microsystems, the day's most active stock, fell 1 1/2to 29 1/2 on 3.2 million shares. The Mountain View, Calif.,maker of computer workstations filed with the Securities andExchange Commission for a proposed combination offering ofseven million shares. More than 5.9 million of those shareswill be newly issued; the rest will be sold by shareholders.   Among other active stocks, MCI Communications gained 7/8to 35 3/8, Apple Computer added 1 1/8 to 39 7/8; SeagateTechnology rose 3/4 to 11; Conner Peripherals jumped 1 1/4 to24 7/8, and Nike sprinted 1 1/4 to 75 1/2.   Amgen jumped 2 1/2 to 46 1/2 after shares of the ThousandOaks, Calif., biotechnology company split two-for-oneyesterday.   William A. Rothe, head of OTC trading at Alex. Brown andamp;Sons, Baltimore, was among several regional market makers whosaid they didn't see a marked increase in business because ofthe breakdown in operations at a number of New York firms. Heattributed the day's relatively smooth and light trading tothe nature of the OTC market, which uses multiple dealersacross the country, and to caution among investors in smallerissues.   &quot;People are relatively content to see what happens in theworld without making any big commitments one way or theother,&quot; Mr. Rothe said. &quot;At the moment, cash is king.&quot;   With about six weeks remaining in the fiscal quarter, Mr.Rothe isn't seeing much inclination among money managers tocommit capital to OTC stocks. He attributed yesterday'srebound in larger OTC issues to the late-afternoon rally inbigger stocks, a &quot;technical&quot; bounce in shares that have beenpressured recently and to some short-covering by traders.When traders &quot;cover their shorts,&quot; they buy shares to replacestocks that they previously borrowed and sold. A short-sellerhopes to profit by replacing borrowed shares later at a lowerprice.   Among other large OTC stocks, Intel was unchanged at 381/4. The Santa Clara, Calif., maker of semiconductorsannounced jointly with Picturetel a five-year agreement forjoint development of interactive digital video processingtechnology. Picturetel gained 1 1/4 to 12 7/8.   Riggs National surged 1 3/4 to 14 3/4. Late Friday, theWashington, D.C., bank said it will pay $33 million for theassets and deposits of National Bank of Washington, a failedbank in the nation's capital. Riggs added 1/2 on Friday.   Applebee's International fell 1 1/4 to 13 1/4, even thoughthe operator of franchised restaurants reported earnings of10 cents a share for the second quarter, compared with ayear-earlier loss of 11 cents a share.   Chemical Fabrics tumbled 3 to 20 1/2 after the maker ofhigh-performance coated fabrics reported that its fiscalfourth-quarter net income fell to one cent a share from 23cents a share a year ago. The latest quarter's $26,000 profitwas after a pretax charge of $2.9 million related to damagesassessed against the company in a dispute over constructionof a roof for Minneapolis' Metrodome stadium.   CPC-Rexcel rose 1/2 to 2 1/4 after the maker of plasticcontainers reported net income rose to two cents a share inthe second quarter from break-even a year earlier.   The American Depositary Receipts of LVMH Moet HennessyLouis Vuitton fell 4 1/4 to 143 3/4. The luxury-goods makerreported that sales rose only 2% in the first half of 1990,largely due to the effect of the dollar and yen's declineagainst the French franc. The company said sales would havebeen up 13% on a constant exchange-rate basis.   ---   Craig S. Smith contributed to this column.</TEXT></DOC>
