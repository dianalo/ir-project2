This book discusses the potentialof these resources, which are believed to exist in practically everysedimentary area of the world. Thus, the papers presented here focuson those conditions and solutions most conductive to the developmentof these resources. Related problems, such as the supply and maintenanceof drilling rigs and associated equipment, as well as training of personnel,are also addressed. Problems in development and design of productionsystems once these resources have been discovered are covered, with particularattention to the resources found in developing countries where gas networksor oil refineries may not exist.</TEXT></DOC>
