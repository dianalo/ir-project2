You see them on abright young man in the Defense Department who ordered a pair of Cyrus Vancetortoise-shell half-glasses to wear at the White House. He didn't need aprescription. Neither did a lot of the young Wall Street hustlers who wantedthe look of probity their glasses gave them in the 1980s.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  EYEGLASSES AREN'T REALLY ABOUT SEEING, BUT ABOUTBEING SEEN  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Cover Story  </MEMO><TEXT>     Eyeglasses are also big business -- $12 billion a year in America, up from$7.8 billion in 1985, according to the Opticians Association of America. Aboutsix out of 10 Americans own glasses.; (hbox);   Atlanta Falcons Coach JerryGlanville on his first meeting with defensive back Tim McKyer: &quot;McKyer had onblack sunglasses and the top of his frame was covered with snakeskin. Thesnakeskin matched his boots. I knew he was one of us.&quot;; (hbox);   There areopticians to the rich and powerful the way there were once wigmakers to thecourt of Louis XVI or mask-makers to lost Polynesian empires.;   &quot;I bought a$2.5 million home in Sherman Oaks, 6,000 square feet, and then as a present tomyself I bought a two-seater Mercedes,&quot; says a Los Angeles optician namedCheryl Shuman.;   Producers send her scripts. She tells them what glasses thecharacters should wear.;   She did Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine in&quot;Postcards From the Edge&quot; -- Streep's yuppie glasses with clip-on shades,MacLaine's old-gal goggles. She put the Robert La Roche MOD.55s on Meg Ryan in&quot;When Harry Met Sally&quot; and then sold 3,000 pairs of them in one day, she says,at $300 apiece. She sells to such collectors as Daryl Hannah, who has 60 pairsof glasses, Shuman says, all of them with non-prescription lenses.;   For&quot;Terminator 2,&quot; Shuman put the Persol 58230 sunglasses on ArnoldSchwarzenegger -- small enough on his huge bones and close enough to his eyesockets that they look like the mask the Phantom wears in the comic strip, butwith a slight feral uptilt that gave Schwarzenegger aphantom-from-the-Neon-Void look. She put the Matsuda remake of 1948 motorcyclegoggles on Linda Hamilton -- a neo-proto-retro look, as if they were anarchaeological find from the ruins of the future, destiny and nostalgia in thesame glasses.;   &quot;Linda Hamilton goes underground in that movie. I wanted awarrior-type look, the look of old army-surplus equipment -- metal, closed offon the sides, focused, strong.&quot;;   The look. Shuman has worked on 2,000different movies, television shows and music videos, doing the look, or eventhe absence of a look.;   &quot;I did Robert Downey Jr. in 'Soapdish,' &quot; she says.&quot;That character is indecisive, noodgy and crazy, so I put him in sevendifferent glasses.&quot;; (hbox);   &quot;Men seldom make passes at girls who wearglasses,&quot; Dorothy Parker wrote. And the corollary, of course, was that men inglasses seldom made passes at girls.;   In the old days, glasses unsexed you-- they feminized men (you couldn't hit a man who wore them, as if they weregirls) and they masculinized women. Clark Kent wore them to prove he wasn'tSuperman. They stood for finger-shaking schoolmarms and repressed secretarieswho were transformed in a moment, in a twinkling of the eyes when a male actorremoved her glasses: &quot;Say, now, Miss Ashcroft . . . &quot;;   Women in glasseslooked sad and distant. Hence the appeal of the cat-eye glasses and harlequinglasses (invented by May Optical in the late '30s), which mimicked the shapeof smiling eyes.;   Men's glasses got sexy in their own right in the '50s,when intellect, alienation and flaws became sexy in men. The tortured JamesDean was seen in glasses. Buddy Holly wore black plastic rims that said, Iwear glasses and I don't care if you think I'm handsome or not.;   At the sametime, androgyny and an edgy weariness would soon be fashionable in women.Twiggy. Unisex. A line of nervous actresses from Jill Clayburgh to MerylStreep.;   Now, 20 years down the line, &quot;men are attracted to a stronger, morepowerful, in-charge, aggressive look,&quot; Cheryl Shuman says. &quot;It's every man'sfantasy to make love to a woman in glasses.&quot;; (hbox);   Little glasses hadvogues in both the '60s and the '80s. In each decade they were wistful claimsto the integrity and authenticity of lost eras.;   Small glasses conveyearnest intensity. When framed in wire they convey industry and fiercemodesty. One thinks of granny glasses, John Lennon's English steel-rimmedhealth-service glasses. By seeming antique, they seemed &quot;natural,&quot; which wasthe opposite of &quot;plastic.&quot;;   In the '80s small glasses were taken up byyuppies and young fogies who wanted to look like 1920s stockbrokers, or palsof Evelyn Waugh. To all the attributes of littleness they added the lawyerlyluxury of tortoise shell -- they did faux-tortoise rims in ridiculousthinness.; (hbox);   Big glasses, balanced on the face like plate glass on theside of a truck, lenses flaring toward the ears, down to the nostrils: Theyare America's Glasses. They are generic, all-around, mid-cult football-coachand politician glasses. They are the glasses worn by George Bush, JesseJackson and Mikhail Gorbachev, and by a thousand television anchormen.;  There are Big-Guy glasses you see in Las Vegas lobbies; aviator glasses withthe built-in frown of the brow bar; the Vaclav Havelcapitalism-with-a-human-face glasses; the mad-moth spectacles on the lateMiles Davis; Old-Gal butterflies with forked temples; Garrison Keillorgood-boy glasses; Jackie O widow's-tears sunglasses.;   Big glasses announceto the world that you're not embarrassed to wear glasses, which announces, ofcourse, that you are embarrassed to wear glasses.; (hbox);   Worn atop awoman's head, glasses convey a &quot;just-popped-in&quot; look that says there areplaces to go, perhaps a dog show to judge, or a perfectly restored Jaguar XK140 waiting outside.;   A State Department official shows up at a Friday nightdinner party wearing half-glasses around her neck on a cord. The cord denotesa woman with better things to worry about than where she left herhalf-glasses; worn at a dinner party, they have the same cachet as combat gearworn in rear areas, a badge of the airborne amid the chairborne.; (hbox);   Asummary of what represents what:;   Round means tradition, authenticity,earnestness, pedigree, intellect.;   Squared-off means progress, technology,can-do, intelligence, engineering.;   Teardrop (aviator style) means masculineadventure.;   Putting the eye high in the frame denotes introspection.;   Lowis optimism and action.;   Tortoise shell is authority.;   Silver wire ismechanical practicality.;   Black wire hints at solid-state electronics andminimalist art.;   Heavy plastic frames mean big ego, big bucks, AristotleOnassis.;   Plastic and wire mixed are '50s retro. They convey a touch ofMalcolm X. If they tilt up a little they acquire a hint of Europe, France inparticular.;   Colored rims are playful, creative and eccentric.;   Rimless iseither coolness, modesty or a denial that you have to wear glasses.;   Tintedlenses are a little mysterious, like unexplained bruises.;   All of the abovecan be combined to produce a sort of image smorgasbord -- a female fighterpilot with a law practice, for instance.;   At the heart of the aesthetics ofglasses, from deliberate contradiction to pre-empting of stereotype, iscoyness.;   Contradiction: Gen. Douglas MacArthur decorated his face withaviator sunglasses, symbol of technological daring, and a corncob pipe, symbolof primitive folk wisdom -- one of the semiotic masterstrokes of the century.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  HENRY ALLEN, Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911226  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,340  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, December 26, 199100361084,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
