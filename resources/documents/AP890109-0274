He is one of some 350 hunters (out of 600 who apply) whom theMongolians allowed in last year. They control the number to preservethe wildlife.   Bremer, 52, also tracked down a tall-horned Siberian ibex as partof the tour, and, for an extra $750, shot a blacktailed gazelle.   He was the last hunter of 1988 to take the Gobi tour. He saidtemperatures in the Mongolian desert plunged to zero, and the windknifed through the treeless scrub at 30 mph.   Bremer, who farms 880 acres of corn and soybeans in Ocheyedan,Iowa, says he read of the Gobi hunt in hunting magazines. For about$6,500 the Mongolian tourist agency, Zhuulchin, provided in-countrytransportation, guides and attendants, and a license to shoot oneGobi sheep and one ibex.   Bremer had to get here on his own, via Beijing.   He also paid a fee of $200 dollars for every inch of the ram'shorn in excess of 43{ inches.   His kill had horns of 51 inches, which Bremer said may make therecord books.   But the experience was more than the hunt. His party passednomadic herdsmen, some armed with rifles and riding camels andhorses as they tended their herds and flocks in the parched bush.   The hunters lived in a yurt, the round tent-like home ofMongolian herdsmen, and were served by an interpreter, a driver, acook, a camp manager and a young woman who tended the stoves andskinned the animals.   The tourist agency also offers safaris to the woodlands ofcentral and northeast Mongolia, where elk, moose, deer and brownbear abound.   G. Batsukh, deputy general director of Zhuulchin, said severalyears ago the government sold licenses to hunt the rare andbeautiful snow leopard found in the Altai range, claiming theleopard population had increased and was preying on cattle, yaks andpeople. But he said only one or two of the white and black leopardswere killed, and shooting licenses are no longer issued.</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
