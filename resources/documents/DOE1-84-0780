The erosion-corrosion componentof the total wear is oxygen-mass-transfer controlled and the magnitudeof the erosion-corrosion can be estimated using well established masstransfer correlations. There is a breakaway velocity for each slurrybelow which mechanical erosion of the pipe is not a problem and it issuggested that slurry pipelines may be operated below this velocity butunder conditions of particle size and velocity where the pipe wall iskept free from rust and scale to prevent pitting corrosion. The erosion-corrosionwould be controlled by inhibitors and/or dearation resulting in a smoothrust and scale free pipe.</TEXT></DOC>
