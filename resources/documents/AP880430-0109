Twenty-one French police officers were still held hostage incaves on the New Caledonian island of Ouvea. An oppositionspokesman demanded that France agree to a referendum onindependence.   In Paris, the main separatist movement accused the Frenchgovernment of waging a ``colonial war'' against the nativeMelanesians.   About 25 military policemen traded gunfire with about 30 armedrebels near a guerrilla encampment at Pouebo, a village on theisland's east coast, said Philippe Berges, chief of staff at theFrench High Commission office here.   A patrol boat just off the coast fired submachine guns at theinsurgents, he said. No injuries were reported on either side.   But the exchange was indicative of the rapidly escalatingproportions of the conflict. Asked if the insurgency had reachedcivil war stage, Berges said: ``It's beginning to look that way.''   The main separatist group, the Kanak Socialist NationalLiberation Front, said in a statement in Paris that the navydetroyed a fishermen's cooperative in Pouebo. It charged that theFrench army was stepping up its operations throughout the territory.   ``Faced with this situation of colonial war, the Kanak peopleare organizing to thwart the occupation forces,'' the statementsaid.   Front spokesman Leopold Joredie said Saturday that the groupwants a mediator appointed to negotiate terms of an island-widereferendum on self-rule.   He said a mediator must be named before the insurgents willrespond to President Francois Mitterrand's appeal for the immediaterelease of the hostages.   The violence began April 22 when separatists tried to blockFrench presidential elections scheduled on New Caledonia on April24. Rebels raided a police station, kidnapping 27 gendarmes andkilling four others.   Twelve hostages were subsequently released. But eight morelawmen were seized Wednesday when they tried to negotiate therelease of the remaining hostages.   Two of those hostages, the head of an anti-terrorism squad andan assistant prosecutor, were subsequently released and ordered tonegotiate on behalf of the terrorists. They were told the remaininghostages would be killed if the two men did not return to the rebelhideout.   Because of that threat, the government said it considers the twoto still be hostages.   The native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, make up 43 percent ofthe territory's 145,000 people. About 36 percent of the populationis European, with the rest primarily Asian or Tahitian.</TEXT></DOC>
