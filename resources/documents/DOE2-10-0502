If the deformationat the surface exceeds 35 nm, it is possible to use holographic interferometryfor detection. The object is illuminated by a double pulsed ruby-laser.The frequency of the flashes is very large. Therefore it is not necessaryto use of a stabilized holographic equipment. In this way it is possibleto detect damage progression in the material of equipment during operationwith non-destructive methods. Usually the severity of a failure is characterizedby the apparent perturbation of its holographic fringe pattern. The methodis applicable to pressure vessels, if the holographic taken fringe patternis related quantitatively to the size of a failure. In this report wepresent the experimental results which give the relation between theperturbation of the holographic fringes and the size of different kindsof failures. The size of the smallest detectable failure is smaller thecritical size of a flaw in the material.</TEXT></DOC>
