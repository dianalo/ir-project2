Wright, who has been named chairman of the Democratic NationalConvention next month in Atlanta, has called the charges aRepublican attempt to embarrass him and the party. However, thespeaker said Wednesday he has not heard concerns from otherDemocrats that the effort could succeed.   The ethics committee began last week to examine charges againstWright filed by political enemy Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. Common Cause,a non-profit group which monitors government ethics, also calledfor a probe of Wright's actions.   The panel, still deciding whether to launch a formal inquiry,planned to meet again on Thursday. Wright was not expected totestify this week, his office said.   Gingrich's complaint said Wright violated House rules when helobbied on behalf of oil companies in cases in which he had afinancial stake, and in his accepting an unusually large royaltycontract from a friend and campaign contractor who published hisbook.   It was reported this week that Wright's book was written withconsiderable help from one of his Capitol Hill employees, includinga taxpayer-financed trip to Texas for the project.   A top aide to Wright, speaking on the condition of anonymity,said Wednesday that the speaker's current book project was alsobeing done with the help of a congressional employee, but hejustified it as commonplace on Capitol Hill.   ``We wouldn't have given a solitary thought to anything likethis before this big flap came up,'' he said.   Gingrich said Tuesday that he too had used a staff member towork on one of his books.   George Mair, a $65,000-a-year press assistant, is collaboratingwith Wright on a book about the speakers of the House throughCongress' first 200 years.   In an interview earlier this week, Mair insisted he was workingon the book only outside of regular working hours but the sourceconceded that work on the book was part of Mair's official duties.   ``One of the things that's envisioned for him to be doing is tobe working on the book about the speakership,'' he said.   The speaker is seeking a publisher for the book, and ``four orfive'' have expressed an interest, Mair said.   Members of Congress frequently have their staffs write speechesfor which the member pockets honoraria, he said, questioning wherethe line should be drawn.</TEXT></DOC>
