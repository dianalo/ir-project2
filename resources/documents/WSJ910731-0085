And it was.</LP><TEXT>   Simple Pleasures, an imitation ice cream made fromSimplesse, has been available only since last summer (andonly in some cities), but many food-industry executives havealready written off the faux fat. Simplesse has already beenovertaken by cheaper -- and maybe even equally delectable --fat substitutes. NutraSweet's consultants predicted thatSimplesse would be a $444 million business, bringing in morethan $20 million in annual profit by 1992. But NutraSweet,which has already sunk $100 million into developing theingredient, won't even come close to that next year. SimplePleasures had sales last year of only $12 million.   NutraSweet executives still say that the best is yet tocome for Simplesse. &quot;We're this close to so many majorannouncements,&quot; declares Robert E. Flynn, NutraSweet's newchief executive, holding his thumb and index finger closetogether for emphasis.   Simplesse was supposed to transform NutraSweet into amajor food company. Executives thought they could pitch thefat substitute as an ingredient that big food companies wouldgobble up even as NutraSweet laid plans to introduce its ownline of foods based on Simplesse. Last year, NutraSweet,originally part of G.D. Searle andamp; Co., and now a division ofMonsanto Co., which acquired Searle in 1985, had sales of$933 million and operating earnings of $183 million, based onsales of its dominant sweetener.   The company's 1969 patent for its sugar substitute,NutraSweet, however, expires next year. With the clockticking, the company needed another hit and thought it wouldbe Simplesse, an engineered mixture of whipped egg whites andskim milk that had been developed in 1979 by Labatt BrewingLtd., in London, Ontario.   Simplesse was intended to simulate not merely the taste offat but its rich texture, its so-called &quot;mouthfeel.&quot; Fat iswhat makes mayonnaise slippery and potato chips crunchy; itis the creaminess in Haagen-Dazs and the gratifyinggreasiness in a Big Mac.   Nowadays consumers see fat's dark underbelly: It tastesgreat, but with it can come love handles and heart disease.In the 1980s, the U.S. surgeon general, among others,recommended that Americans scale back their fat consumption.Accordingly, executives at NutraSweet sensed that there wouldbe a vast market for a substance that would enable people toeat rich-tasting foods and escape the consequences.Fortuitously, NutraSweet had hired Norman Singer, one of theinventors of Simplesse, in 1983, and bought the sales rightsto the creation.   To bring the ersatz fat to market, NutraSweet in 1986tapped 29-year-old David Morley. Robert B. Shapiro,NutraSweet's then chairman and chief executive, gave Mr.Morley authority to run his own show, and the Simplesse Groupwas set up in Skokie, Ill., 12 miles from NutraSweet'sheadquarters. Mr. Morley's background was finance. He wasneither a marketer nor inventor. And, as it turned out, hewas no diplomat.   Mr. Morley was given to what former employees call&quot;shrieking matches&quot; with Mr. Singer, the co-inventor ofSimplesse, over the pace of its development. (Mr. Singer washaving trouble coming up with the ultimate imitation vanillaice cream.) On those occasions, underlings starved forinformation about what was going on in their own divisionwould gather outside Mr. Morley's office and eavesdrop on hisconversations. The Simplesse chief shunned staff meetings,former associates say, on the ground that he wasn'tresponsible for keeping everyone informed. In 1989, apsychologist brought in by the company talked with the youngmanager and his staff about his interpersonal relations.NutraSweet says the psychologist was retained to &quot;help usdevelop better communication pathways across the company.&quot;   Once Mr. Morley, upset by a quotation he had read in awire-service dispatch about his Simplesse Group, drove toNutraSweet headquarters and, according to people present,gave the P.R. man responsible a tongue-lashing in front offellow workers. Mr. Morley later apologized, they say. Hedeclines to comment about how he deals with employees.   From the start, mystery surrounded the Simplesse Group andits research and marketing operations. Mr. Morley was sosecretive that even some senior NutraSweet executives weren'tkept up to date on the project.   And though he is said to have agonized over decisions, heseldom solicited the advice of his staff, former employeessay, preferring instead to hire outside consultants. Some ofhis marketing people quit because they say they feltsuperfluous and were uncomfortable with his management style.   Sam Molinary, NutraSweet's former regulatory vicepresident, heard about Simplesse by accident. Then, just daysbefore the product was to be announced with great fanfare, helearned that one of the fake fat's ingredients had beenchanged from whey protein concentrate to egg whites -- aswitch that would force him to rethink whether Simplesse wasgoing to meet the criteria of the Food and DrugAdministration's so-called GRAS list of ingredients&quot;generally recognized as safe.&quot;   Worried about the FDA, Mr. Molinary urged NutraSweet'shead, Mr. Shapiro, to restrain his claims in the pressunveiling and avoid any mention of whether FDA approval wasgoing to be required. The FDA had put the company through thewringer for six years in reviewing NutraSweet between 1975and 1981. The last thing the company wanted was anothertangle with the regulators.   Nonetheless, an ebullient Mr. Shapiro appeared on the CBSMorning News and boasted that Simplesse wouldn't needapproval because it was &quot;all natural.&quot; He repeated the claimat a huge media briefing in New York Jan. 27, 1988. Caught bysurprise, Frank Young, then commissioner of the FDA, listenedincredulously to this televised display of bravado -- andphoned Mr. Shapiro at his hotel.   In fact, Simplesse is nothing more than processed eggs andmilk, but what galled FDA brass was NutraSweet's arrogance inproclaiming that the wonder &quot;fat&quot; didn't need FDA review. Inhindsight, Mr. Molinary believes the FDA &quot;thought we werehiding a new chemical entity. . . . Even though we said itwas all natural, it seemed to me Dr. Young didn't believeit.&quot;   The next morning, Mr. Shapiro and NutraSweet employeesflew to Washington, where the FDA's Dr. Young lit into them.   Failing to mollify the FDA cost Simplesse its huge headstart. The agency took two years to review Simplesse -- itsingredients and processing -- before finally approving itsuse in frozen desserts.   But Simplesse really wasn't ready for market anyway. Backin the lab, the fat impostor still had major technologicalproblems.   &quot;The delay caused by the FDA was a blessing for NutraSweetbecause it gave them an out,&quot; says Robert Dudley, a formerNutraSweet manager, who is now vice president of research anddevelopment at Gynex Inc., a pharmaceutical research firm inVernon Hills, Ill. &quot;They hadn't done enough fundamentalresearch and development before they put themselves under thegun of having to come up with a product.&quot;   As an ingredient, Simplesse is temperamental. It curdleswhen heated to high temperature, which makes it hard to usein baked goods. And in the refrigerator, its shelf life isshort. The Simplesse illusion is made possible by whipping upits prosaic ingredients into microparticulated beads so tinythat 50 billion of them will fit in a teaspoon. After a fewweeks, however, the beadlets begin to adhere to one another.And when the clumps get big enough, the silky smooth,fat-like texture of Simplesse begins to have a distinctlygritty feel on the tongue.   That problem and myriad others dogged the Simplesse team'sattempt to come up with the perfect imitation ice cream.Messrs. Shapiro and Morley believed that an artificial icecream, rich in taste and high in price but devoid of fat,would be the ultimate product in which to show off Simplesse.   At a Christmas dinner at Chicago's Palm Restaurant in1989, Mr. Shapiro told executives from Ogilvy andamp; Mather, thead agency for NutraSweet and Simplesse, that &quot;if those idiotsBen andamp; Jerry can do it, why can't we?&quot;   Steve McNeil, who until this month was a senior vicepresident at Haagen-Dazs, says NutraSweet was guilty ofhubris. &quot;They presumed an ability to operate effectively inan industry they didn't know much about.&quot;   Indeed, for months, the frazzled research team couldn'tcreate a vanilla flavor that came close to rivaling theHaagen-Dazs standard -- though in taste tests Mr. Morleyregularly made the comparison. Says Mr. Molinary: &quot;Dave usedto hand you the container and say, `Doesn't it taste likeHaagen-Dazs?' And everyone would say, `Yes, it tastes likeHaagenDazs.'&quot;   Actually, recalls one former Simplesse marketer, &quot;ittasted like chalk.&quot; Moreover, early versions of SimplePleasures melted too slowly and left a scummy ring around thebowl.   Worse, NutraSweet brass badly underestimated how much itwould cost to make and market a product mimicking ice cream,how much manufacturing capacity they needed, and howdifficult it would be to go from small batches made in thelab to large-scale production lines.   The start-up was so rocky that NutraSweet spent $5 millionmaking batches of its frozen dessert that were never sold,one ex-NutraSweet executive estimates. A labeling error, forwhich NutraSweet blames a supplier, overstated how muchVitamin A was in Simple Pleasures, and the packaging had tobe redone. Because of that, product and packaging ended up ina landfill.   When Simple Pleasures finally hit the market last summer,the company's main plant couldn't keep up with initialdemand. The brand never did live up to the Haagen-Dazsstandard, except for its price (the suggested retail price is$2.39 a pint), which hurt Simple Pleasures in competing withcheaper diet brands.   A number of newspapers have convened informal tastingpanels to see how Simple Pleasures stacks up against otherfrozen desserts. The consensus seems to be that while SimplePleasures isn't dreadful, it isn't ice cream. But sometasters say it compares well with other low-fat and no-fatbrands.   The proliferation of pseudo ice creams using conventionalgums, gels and other, cheaper ingredients (potato starcheven) instead of breakthrough fat substitutes, also hasundercut Simple Pleasures.   &quot;Simple Pleasures' point of difference wasn't very clearto consumers,&quot; says Yves Coleon, vice president of marketingat Haagen-Dazs, a unit of Grand Metropolitan PLC. &quot;The valueof their fat substitute was diluted by competitive entries.&quot;   But NutraSweet could no longer afford to re-acquaintconsumers with the wonders of Simplesse. In late 1990, afterMr. Shapiro left, Monsanto cracked down on the free-spendingNutraSweet unit.   NutraSweet didn't fare much better in persuading corporatecustomers to sign agreements to use Simplesse in theirproducts. NutraSweet executives were very secretive aboutdiscussing the details of the company's fake-fatbreakthrough, since its patent doesn't offer much protectionto its microparticulation process. &quot;The technology that wentinto it wasn't very strong. You could basically reproduce itin your kitchen,&quot; says a former manufacturing executive.   Companies that have done business with NutraSweet in thepast tend to be twice shy. In the 1980s the attitudes of suchNutraSweet customers as Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo Inc., GeneralFoods Corp. and Thomas J. Lipton Co. were described in aninternal NutraSweet study as falling &quot;in a tight range ofanger, dislike, mistrust and bad feeling&quot; because they feltthat with its sweetener, NutraSweet had been high-handed withthem in contract negotiations, demanding a steep price andinsisting that the NutraSweet logo go on their products. Somehoped that, with Simplesse, NutraSweet would get itscomeuppance.   Borden Inc. executives say NutraSweet offered a Simplessedeal in the summer of 1989 that would give NutraSweet jointownership of any patents that Borden might derive from itsuse of the fake fat. NutraSweet, furthermore, wanted theauthority to make Borden's formulations available to Borden'srivals in the dairy industry. It was &quot;very one-sided andtotally unacceptable,&quot; recalls Eugene Skiest, Borden'sdirector of research and technology. And Borden refused to doa deal, even when the offer was made more palatable thefollowing year.   NutraSweet did sign up a customer in August 1989, grantingKraft General Foods the exclusive right to use Simplesse in aproduct mimicking mayonnaise. But months earlier, Kraft hadbegun work on its own Simplesse-like ingredient, code-namedTrailblazer. Former executives of NutraSweet say that insigning with Simplesse Kraft merely hoped to keep the productout of the hands of archrival CPC International Inc., whichmakes Best Foods and Hellman's Real Mayonnaise. A KraftGeneral Foods spokesman declines comment.   Furthermore, when Kraft began experimenting withNutraSweet's wonder-fat, it found the ingredient hard to workwith. And the deal came unglued just five months after it wassigned. Kraft was allowed to drop out of the agreement inexchange for keeping quiet about the problems it had withSimplesse. A month later came Kraft Free Mayo, which usescellulose gel, not Simplesse.   To date, NutraSweet has managed to persuade just four U.S.companies to use Simplesse in frozen desserts: Baskin-RobbinsInc., Eskimo Pie Corp., a Chicago cheese cake company and adairy in Omaha. NutraSweet insists the FDA will soon grantapproval for other uses, such as pretend cheese, a productsort of like yogurt and a salad dressing. (Last weekNutraSweet announced agreements with two companies, one Irishand the other Finnish, to use Simplesse in spreads not unlikebutter.) But potentially large customers such as Unilever PLCare working on their own fat replacers, and a host ofcheaper, more convenient and FDA-blessed alternatives alreadyare on the market, ranging from Pfizer Inc.'s Litesse(polydextrose) to A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co.'s Stellar(modified cornstarch.)   And what became of Messrs. Shapiro and Morley? They gotpromoted. Mr. Morley now leads the newly created FoodIngredients Group, selling both Simplesse and NutraSweet tofood processors. Mr. Shapiro, 52, now runs Monsanto'sagricultural chemicals business. Some think he is in line tobecome CEO of Monsanto.   NutraSweet's new chief, Mr. Flynn, had a reputation as acost cutter when he ran Monsanto's Fisher Controls.Dispatched to NutraSweet as a Mr. Fix-It, he has wastedlittle time waking Simplesse from its dream. In February, hesaid the company would concentrate on selling Simplesse as aningredient. There's no more talk of making NutraSweet a bigfood company. NutraSweet now says its goal never was to useSimplesse for that purpose. It does want to continue makingand selling its facsimile ice cream. But, says Mr. Flynn,&quot;It's not a strategic focus of the business.&quot;   Under Mr. Flynn, Simplesse's shelf life has been extendedto five weeks from two, and its wholesale price has beenlowered. And NutraSweet says it finally has figured out howto use Simplesse in baking some baked goods. Moreover,NutraSweet no longer requires customers to display theSimplesse logo on their products and has slimmed its 80 pagesof restrictions down to two.   &quot;Simplesse is going to succeed because it's the besttechnology for getting the fat out of food,&quot; declares Mr.Shapiro.   And while naysayers contend that the parade has long sincepassed Simplesse by, Mr. Singer, the inventor, is thinking inmore ethereal terms: Simplesse, he says, &quot;is spiritually andconceptually another NutraSweet.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
