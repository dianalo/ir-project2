But despite their apparent agreement on these goals, thetwo men and their respective parties remain far apart onsignificant details on taxes and spending priorities,including how much the defense budget should be pared.</LP><TEXT>   During a speech and an interview, Sen. Mitchell reiteratedhis party's backing for a tax cut for the middle class, andwelcomed the president's recent embrace of the idea. He alsojoined the president in calling for corporate tax breaks thatwould inspire quick investment.   The Maine Democrat predicted Congress will pass a billthis year that cuts taxes for individuals and corporations.He said it will do so &quot;as soon as possible.&quot;   Sen. Mitchell's comments reflect an emerging strategy bycongressional Democrats to demonstrate a desire to work withthe president for quick results and to minimize their obviousdisagreements with the White House. In part, the goal is toprotect themselves from accusations that Congress is anobstacle to measures that would help the economy.   The Democrats' differences with the administration aresubstantial. The president probably will propose a smallertax cut for the middle class than the Democrats want. Theadministration also is expected to propose cuts in Medicareand other benefit programs to pay for some of its tax cuts --a plan the Democrats would reject.   Moreover, the administration is again going to propose acut in the capital-gains tax, which Sen. Mitchell wouldaccept only if the top individual income-tax rate isincreased -- a trade-off that is anathema to President Bush.   Still, Mr. Bush and the top-ranking Democrat in the Senatenow agree, in theory, on these basic budgetary issues:   -- Funds previously designated for military spendingshould be diverted to domestic needs. Sen. Mitchell suggestedtaking more than $100 billion from military accounts overfive years. White House House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidyesterday: &quot;We'll be transferring savings from defense todeal with various aspects of domestic programs.&quot; ManyRepublicans have said any peace dividend should be used onlyto cut taxes and reduce the deficit, not add to domesticspending. Mr. Bush previously supported that position, and hestill appears unlikely to go as far as the Democrats inshifting defense funds to domestic programs.   -- &quot;Middle-class&quot; families should be given a tax cut tohelp revive the lagging economy. Sen. Mitchell declined tospecify the type of tax cut he preferred, but he said thatreductions of $30 billion to $50 billion over five years havebeen widely discussed; President Bush is expected to proposean increase in the personal exemption -- possibly just fordependent children -- to accomplish this goal.   -- A tax credit should be given for first-time homebuyers. Both President Bush and Sen. Mitchell would allowpenalty-free withdrawals from individual retirement accountsfor first-time home buyers.   -- Special tax breaks should be given to corporations forthe purchase of new plant and equipment. Sen. Mitchell urgedthe approval of a temporary investment-tax credit. PresidentBush is expected to propose rapid write-offs for these samepurchases, and Sen. Mitchell said he would be open to such anapproach.   -- The research-and-development tax credit should be madepermanent.   Sen. Mitchell said he intends to sit down soon with otherDemocratic leaders in Congress to discuss budgetaryproposals.   In sharp contrast to past years' budget plans, this year'sis likely to widen the budget deficit, at least in the shortrun, rather than aim to reduce it. The reason is that theDemocrats want to stimulate the weak economy, and believethat more deficit spending, rather than less, would do that.Sen. Mitchell and other Democrats, however, said they intendto make sure that the deficit isn't widened over the longterm.   Sen. Mitchell said his proposal would neither widen nornarrow the deficit over five years. In the first year,though, the plan probably would add to the deficit, he said.He declined to say how much red ink he would expect, but hedid note that economists have testified that a deficitincrease of about $50 billion would be needed to stimulatethe economy. The deficit is projected to be a record of about$360 billion in the current fiscal year.   Slated for increases in domestic spending under Sen.Mitchell's plan would be aid to state and local governments,extended unemployment benefits and education, research andtraining programs.   The senator also took a hard partisan shot at PresidentBush, saying Mr. Bush sounded &quot;like a panicky candidate in alosing campaign for president rather than a presidentconfidently seeking re-election.&quot;   Sen. Mitchell's proposed cuts in the military are almosttwice as deep as the reductions many Pentagon planners andWhite House aides have been considering. More importantly,his package would rely much more on cutting personnel andtraining than Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has been willingto support.   Mr. Cheney's latest cutback plans, for instance, envisionsaving an additional $15 billion or so over the next fewyears by letting active-duty military forces slip below the1.6 million President Bush has advocated. By contrast, Sen.Mitchell hopes to save as much as $40 billion over the sameperiod by slashing the number of personnel and sharplyreducing training efforts.   The Pentagon contends that cuts of that magnitude woulddecimate morale, force out thousands of officers and returnthe military to the malaise of the post-Vietnam era. Thosewho seek swift defense-outlay reductions, however, counterthat cutting personnel and training are the only ways toachieve large and immediate savings.   Sen. Mitchell's speech is bound to run into flak fromDemocratic leaders in the House, who are still trying todevise their own cutback proposals. Just a few hours beforeSen. Mitchell's speech, House Armed Services Committeechairman Les Aspin (D., Wis.) told reporters that he andHouse Democratic leaders are assembling a defense package --to be unveiled by the end of next week -- that they hopedwill be embraced by their Senate counterparts and byDemocratic presidential candidates.   Rep. Aspin's aides said they hadn't yet come up with anoverall spending target. But unlike Sen. Mitchell's plan, theHouse version is expected to be backed by a detailedassessment of changes in the international military threatsfacing the U.S.   ---   Andy Pasztor contributed to this story.</TEXT></DOC>
