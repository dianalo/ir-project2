Concerns mount that the campaign is overconfident. Dukakis, expecting his lead in the polls to vanish, plans to strike an activist profile in coming weeks. In a speech Sunday and a swing South next week, he will open a new drive keyed to drugs, crime and family issues. He plans to zero in on Bush's actions as head of the South Florida drug task force.    The search for a running mate takes center stage. The focus: character, foreign-policy credentials and populism. Indiana Rep. Hamilton is a new possibility among some campaign insiders. But top contenders remain Sens. Glenn, Nunn, Bradley and Bentsen. Some Democrats think Dukakis fund-raiser Bob Farmer could quickly wipe out Glenn's $2.3 million 1984 campaign debt.    The Dukakis campaign won't fight Jackson's platform demand that South Africa be labeled a terrorist state.    OCTOBER SURPRISE? Speculation is raised about an Iranian hostage ploy.    A National Security Council staff memo warns that Iran may try to use the nine American hostages in Lebanon as political pawns during the Bush-Dukakis race. The memo, written by Mideast specialist Robert Oakley, foresees possible offers to release some hostages before the November election. The price, some officials think: A promise that Bush would soften the U.S.'s anti-Iran stance.    An Iranian official recently tried to arrange a clandestine meeting with a Bush aide whose colleagues told him he would be &quot;crazy&quot; to meet secretly with the Iranian. There haven't been any discussions with Iran, U.S. officials say. The speculation is partly aimed at deterring any temptation to make a deal with Iran.    LEGAL QUESTIONS threaten to derail the U.S.-Canada trade treaty.    A constitutional challenge seems certain, even after both nations ratify the pact. At issue: a dispute-settlement mechanism that substitutes arbitration for court appeals. Some legal scholars warn that U.S. companies can't be deprived totally of the right to challenge trade decisions in court. The scholars include a Harvard law professor who soon will join the Justice Department.    Companion legislation in Congress would allow courts to handle constitutional issues arising from arbitrators' rulings. The bill also would set up a process for an early court test of the treaty's overall legality. But &quot;there are still very serious constitutional questions,&quot; says public-interest lawyer Alan Morrison.    Another legal question also surfaces: Can federal agencies bow to rulings by non-government arbitrators?    SWITCH-HITTER? Former Carter national-security adviser Brzezinski may end up in the Bush camp. &quot;He's had some direct conversations with Bush about a {campaign} role, but it hasn't been defined yet,&quot; a top Bush political aide says. Brzezinski says he has worked with Bush on &quot;sensitive missions&quot; in recent years, but denies talking with Bush about a campaign post.    FEATHERING BYRD'S NEST: Friends of Senate Majority Leader Byrd lobby to increase the budget for the office of Senate president pro tempore next fiscal year to about $400,000 from $153,000 now. Byrd is expected to take the post next year when he steps down as Senate leader.    MEESE WILL SEEK up to a two-week delay in public release of Independent Counsel McKay's report on the attorney general, expected to be completed next week. His lawyers want time to analyze and respond to the document, which is expected to sharply criticize Meese. A court panel will decide, but a full two-week delay is unlikely.    SUNUNU'S SHADOW: Dukakis aides plan to pair Arkansas Gov. Clinton regularly with New Hampshire Gov. Sununu when TV news shows seek a spokesman to appear with Sununu, a top Bush backer. The personable Clinton's performance against Sununu recently on &quot;The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour&quot; impressed the Dukakis camp.    REPUBLICANS RUSH to the middle in Senate races as the political tide turns.    Some GOP candidates seem more like Democrats. Former Sen. Gorton of Washington state laments the federal government's &quot;benign neglect&quot; of social issues. Rep. Lott boosts the kind of pork-barrel spending for highways in Mississippi he has always opposed. At least three Republicans in tough Senate races call for Meese to resign.    The trend reflects polls showing voters want a more activist government than the GOP has supported. &quot;Whoever said that elephants never forget would be surprised to meet this year's Republican Senate candidates,&quot; snipes Democratic Sen. Kerry. But some liberal Democrats take more conservative stances on the budget, defense and social issues.    The Democratic Senate challenger in Connecticut tries to get right of Sen. Weicker by advocating a moment of silence in schools.    MINOR MEMOS: Theodore Sorensen's draft of a Democratic platform, criticized for being too short, surprisingly omits four words: Republicans, Bush, North and Meese. . . . Grass-roots appeal: With Bush from an affluent Houston district and Dukakis from upscale Brookline, political analyst Alan Baron says the presidential rivals represent &quot;the best-kept yards in America.&quot; . . . Relaxing from his presidential run, Jackson stays in a villa at the La Costa resort north of San Diego, where rates start at $825 a day. </TEXT></DOC>
