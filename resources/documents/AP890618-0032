WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's mayors moved Sunday toward astrong new policy statement advocating higher federal taxes, withRepublican mayors firmly in support of the departure fromadministration policy.   The proposed resolution before the U.S. Conference of Mayors atits annual meeting called on Congress and the Bush administration``to raise revenues in a fair, equitable and progressive way.''   The mayors, from more than 200 cities, neared approval on a widerange of resolutions on other issues, including one on the drugproblem that calls for a ban on the possession of semi-automaticassault weapons. It also calls for converting closed and underusedmilitary bases to use as prisons and drug treatment centers.   The position on gun control would go far beyond the Bushadministration's current ban on the importation offoreign-manufactured semi-automatics. It would ban the domesticmanufacture and sale as well as banning possession.   Both the drugs and taxes resolutions were approved with nodissent by the conference's resolutions committee and appearedheaded for approval by the full group at its concluding sessionWednesday.   Among the other resolutions was one saying the conferencedeplores recent Supreme Court decisions that civil rights advocatessay have weakened affirmative programs aimed at endingdiscrimination in employment. It calls on Congress to enactlegislation protecting affirmative action programs.   ``The problem with these decisions is it's just opening thefloodgates for negative lawsuits trying to undue just literallyhundreds and thousands of plans all around the country that havebasically been working pretty well,'' said Mayor Bill Hudnut ofIndianapolis, a Republican.   Although the budget statement uses the word ``revenues'' ratherthan taxes, there was no disputing that the mayors were advocating afederal tax increase. The resolution says the money raised should goboth to reduce the federal budget deficit and to finance new urbanaid programs.   ``A realistic evaluation of the deficit problem confirms that noeffective deficit reduction approach can be implemented without asignificant infusion of revenues into the federal treasury,'' thestatement said.   ``What we're being is realistic,'' said Republican Mayor BobIsaac of Colorado Springs, Colo., one of the conference's leaders.``I think it's pretty moderate.''   Most of the debate over the call for new federal taxes cameearlier in smaller committee meetings and before the conference'sexecutive committee. Republican mayors, outnumbered by Democrats,supported the call for higher taxes in those sessions.   Bill Canary, the White House's intergovernmental relationsdirector representing the administration here, said in an interviewthat the White House made no effort to oppose the resolution eventhough President Bush made a campaign pledge not to raise taxes.   ``Our position here has largely been one of observing,'' Canarysaid.   The mayors' statement goes further in calling for new taxes thanthe group has in the past, executive director Tom Cochran said. Butit does not go as far as a similar group, the League of Cities, wentlast winter in naming a list of taxes it thought should be raised,including the income tax.   The Conference of Mayors resolution calls on Congress to considerreducing defense spending ``consistent with national security,'' aposition the mayors have advocated previously. Mayors deleted aproposal supported by Republicans that would have called for anexamination of entitlement programs such as Social Security andfederal retirement programs.   Oddly, it was some of the more liberal Democratic mayors whoopposed the call for higher taxes, arguing that the statement mightnot be well received in Congress, while Republicans advocated it inthe committees.   ``It makes no sense from a political standpoint to go in thereand say, `We need to raise taxes,''' said Mayor John O. Norquist ofMilwaukee.   The mayors' statement laments the massive growth of the federalbudget deficit throughout the Reagan administration despite majorcutbacks in federal spending on urban programs during those sameyerars. It said federal funds for key urban programs have beenreduced by 82 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
