They also lauded Bush's measured response to the Chinesegovernment's brutal crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.   Many of the 17 Asian-Americans who met privately with Bush wereRepublican party activists, including Anna Chenault, head of theNational Republican Asian Assembly, and Cindy Shinga Daub, who wasnational director of Asian-Americans for Bush-Quayle.   Bush said he intends to nominate Ms. Daub as the new chairman ofthe Copyright Royalty Tribunal effective Sept. 27. He also told thegroup that John B. Tsu will head the secretary of education'sregional office in San Francisco.   Cressey Nakagawa, national president of the Japanese AmericanCitizens' League, appealed for Bush's help to speed reparationpayments to the World War II internees.   Former President Ronald Reagan signed legislation last Aug. 10authorizing payments of $20,000 each to the 60,000 survivors of the120,000 Japanse-Americans interned during the war. But Congress andthe administration have been slow to come up with the funds toactually make the payments.   Tsu, who teaches at John F. Kennedy University in Orienda,Calif., said he raised the issue of discrimination in admissions,and ``the president was very much concerned.''   Bush noted how many high school valedictorians areAsian-Americans, and said admissions ``should be equal and fair,''according to Tsu.   Asian-Americans have charged some elite universities limitadmissions of their children and hold them to higher entrystandards than other students.   Tsu said the Office for Civil Rights at the Department ofEducation is currently conducting compliance surveys at theUniversity of California, Los Angeles, and Harvard University.   On the China situation, Mrs. Chennault said, ``I have suggestedto our president we should be firm and yet be positive'' toward thegovernment in Beijing.   ``I think the president, looking in the long term, is taking avery reasonable, realistic position,'' said Mrs. Chennault, whosaid ``top leaders'' in China have invited her to visit.   Frank Yining Liu, president of the Organization of ChineseAmericans and law professor at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh,said they also urged Bush to ``preserve the principle of familyunification'' in U.S. immigration policies.   John K. Lim, president of the Federation of Korean AmericanAssociations of America, said Bush had a chance to ``open the doorto North Korea,'' as former President Nixon did with China.   Heng Cheng, a former president of Cambodia now living inHouston, said he asked for Bush's support to get a chance toparticipate in talks in Paris on settling the strife in Cambodia.   Krishna Srinivasa, co-chairman of Indian-Americans forBush-Quayle '88, said, ``We are very delighted. ... It is the firsttime in the history of the United States where a president hastaken special interest to call'' such a meeting of Asian-Americanleaders.   The Korean-born Ms. Daub is a former official of the Departmentof Health and Human Services. Her husband, Hal Daub, is the formerRepublican congressman defeated last year in a Senate race inNebraska.</TEXT></DOC>
