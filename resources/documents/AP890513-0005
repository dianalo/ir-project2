(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The attorney for former CIA agent JosephFernandez says a classified documents law would force him to giveprosecutors ``a soup to nuts disclosure'' of the defense's casebefore the Iran-Contra figure goes to trial.   Defense lawyer Thomas Wilson told a court hearing Friday thatthe Classified Information Procedures Act was unconstitutional andwould seriously harm Fernandez's case.   Fernandez was the CIA station chief in Costa Rica when formerNational Security Council aide Oliver North was helping supplyweapons to the Nicaraguan Contras during a congressional ban onsuch assistance.   A federal grand jury, under supervision of Iran-Contraindependent counsel Lawrence Walsh, charged that Fernandez liedabout his role in the Contra arms network.   The Classified Information Procedures Act would force thedefense to notify prosecutors in advance of the classifieddocuments Fernandez plans to use. Wilson told U.S. District JudgeClaude Hilton that ``100 percent of the domain of evidence isclassified'' and that Fernandez would have to ``reveal his defensein a way that would be wholly unreciprocated by the government.''   Iran-Contra prosecutor Geoffrey Stewart told the judge that muchof the information in the case no longer involves classifiedmatters and that the defense ``overstates what is required.''   Hilton took the case under advisement.   Fernandez, who used the code name of Tomas Castillo in CentralAmerica, was charged with four criminal counts. He is accused ofobstructing inquiries by the CIA general counsel and thepresidentially appointed Tower commission that investigated theIran-Contra arms and money affair, and false swearing in connectionwith those inquiries.   The indictment said Fernandez falsely told the CIA that anairstrip in Costa Rica, used to supply the Contras, was built bythe Costa Rican government to train pilots for a possibleNicaraguan invasion of Costa Rica.   Fernandez allegedly lied to the Tower commission by denying thathe knew the now-convicted North was involved in helping arm theContras.   Each of four charges in the indictment carries a maximumfive-year sentence and a $250,000 fine upon conviction.   Hilton noted that a hearing was scheduled May 26 on documentsthat prosecutors might have to reveal to the defense. The judgesaid that if he rules the government must give the defensesubstantial information about the prosecution case, there would beno harm to Fernandez.   North's trial on Iran-Contra charges was conducted under theclassified procedures law, after surviving a similar challenge fromthe defense.</TEXT></DOC>
