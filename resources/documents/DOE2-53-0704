The valuesof N(epsilon) and v/sub {alpha}/(epsilon) come directly from the calculatedeigenvalue spectrum, whereas tau(epsilon) requires an additional calculation.If electron-phonon scattering dominates (which provides a reasonableand conservative explanation for the measured rho/sub {alpha}{alpha}/(T)in samples with linear T-dependence and rrr {ge} 4) then tau(epsilon)is given by 1/tau(epsilon) = 2{pi}{lambda}(epsilon)k/sub B/T/n and {lambda}(epsilon)can be approximated by {Sigma} eta/sub a/(epsilon)/M/sub a/andless;omega{sup2}andgt; where eta/sub a/(epsilon) has already been calculated in the rigidmuffin tin model. Alternatively, if impurity scattering dominates, onemight assume 1/tau(epsilon) {alpha} N(epsilon), or possibility 1/tau(epsilon)= const. The results for {sigma}/sub {alpha}{alpha}/(epsilon) and S/sub{alpha}{alpha}/(T) for all three models are given. All three models predictmoderately large positive (hole-like) behavior of S/sub zz/ and smaller,negative (electron-like) behavior of S/sub xx/.</TEXT></DOC>
