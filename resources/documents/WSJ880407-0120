American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. has its affirmative action protesters. GTE Corp. and United Telecommunications Inc. have Paul Walton.    Mr. Walton, a 32-year-old former subcontractor for the two companies' US Sprint Communications Co. phone joint venture, has already won $1,740,000 from US Sprint arising from a contract dispute. Now, he wants more: He wants to be president of US Sprint.    Mr. Walton says he plans to attend annual meetings of GTE and United, to appeal directly to shareholders. There is one problem, however. The job of US Sprint president is already filled and shareholders don't choose the candidate, a six-member partnership committee of GTE and United executives does.    But that hasn't stopped Mr. Walton from hiring advance men, calling up reporters, and handing out T-shirts and bumper stickers reading &quot;Sprint lost a $billion$. Paul made a $million$. Make Paul president!&quot; In what US Sprint calls a &quot;symbolic&quot; move, he's renting U.S. Rep. Richard Gephardt's former Kansas City campaign headquarters.    Mr. Walton, who signed up customers for a predecessor company of US Sprint, says he will probably spend some $60,000 on his campaign. He has been speaking on college campuses and in front of public buildings. Today, he plans to be on Wall Street in New York. His platform: reforming US Sprint's billing problems.    US Sprint says it already knows, from volumes of customer complaints, about its billing problems. &quot;The problems he is talking about are old hat. We don't know what his purpose is,&quot; says Del Wnorowski, senior vice president and general counsel of US Sprint. As far as US Sprint is concerned the Walton matter was closed with a $1,740,000 check.    Mr. Walton says he just wants the thousands of customers he signed up for US Sprint service to know he still cares about them. At his talks, he's handing out the address of the Federal Communications Commission so customers can complain directly.    But he may have an ulterior motive. Mr. Walton says during negotiations on his contract dispute he told US Sprint he wouldn't publicly talk about US Sprint's problems if US Sprint paid him $2 million instead of $1,740,000. And, he says, what he really wants is to work for another phone company &quot;that appreciates a salesperson who has integrity and will stand behind&quot;' the service he is selling.    If Mr. Walton is just slamming US Sprint to curry favor with a competitor, however, he may find himself back in a legal wrangle with US Sprint. &quot;We will take issue with that,&quot; says Mr. Wnorowski. </TEXT></DOC>
