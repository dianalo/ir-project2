Radiochemical analysis of the preparation usingpaper chromatography (PC), thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high performanceliquid chromatography (HPLC) indicated a stable product with one majorcomponent. The labelling efficiency was approximately 90%. Animal biodistributionstudies performed in mice showed that most of the injected radioactivitywas confined to the liver, kidney, lungs, intestine and heart. The heartto blood ratio was small but persisted up to 3 hrs. after the injection.</TEXT></DOC>
