<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-01-1096 </DOCNO><TEXT>Cetyl-trimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB) was added to sodium silicate solutionand geothermal hot water (Ohtake Geothermal Power Plant and HatchobaruGeo-thermal Power Plant) to precipitate silica. 1) CTA ions do not reactwith monosilicic acid, but only the polymerization among the polysilicicacids proceeds and causes silica to precipitate. Optimum pH for the silicaprecipitation is 6 - 7 and the higher concentration of polysilicic acidwill cause more precipitation. 2) When added to geothermal hot water,the silica precipita-tion increases with the increase of CTAB concentrationwithin the range of 10{sup -7} - 10{sup -4} mol dm{sup 3} concentration.Almost all poly-silicic acid precipitated at 10{sup -4} mol dm{sup 3}when measured for silica precipitation after 5 minutes. Total concentrationof silicic acid was higher in the Hatchobaru geothermal water than thatof the Ohtake geothermal water. (10 figs, 14 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
