Eighteen Chilean journalists currently are being tried bymilitary courts in 28 different cases, all of them on charges of``offending'' or ``defaming'' the armed forces.   A journalist can be arrested if a military official deems anarticle or broadcast to be offensive to him or his service, eventhough the report is true.   A navy prosecutor has requested jail sentences of four and threeyears, respectively, for Fernando Paulsen, chief editor of theopposition weekly Cauce, and Ivan Badilla, a reporter for themagazine. It was believed to be the stiffest sanctions ever soughtin a press trial. Paulsen and Badilla are accused of offending thenavy in a story suggesting that it agreed to an inflated price inthe purchase of French-made helicopters.   Nine other journalists face charges before civilian courts.   A 1988 report by lawyers of the Vicary of Solidarity, the RomanCatholic Church's human rights agency in Chile, said 34 differentlaws affect freedom of the press.   The report also criticized what the vicary perceived as anincreased reliance on military courts to deal with the press.   ``The government in recent years has chosen the military courtsas an extraordinarily useful deterrant against the media and freepublic information,'' it said.   The military codes were changed twice in recent years to stiffenpenalities for ``opinion or press crimes,'' according to JoseGaliano, a lawyer who works as an adviser for the ChileanJournalists Association.   One change, he noted in an interview, increased from five yearsto 10 the maximum penalty for any journalist found guilty of``offending'' the armed forces or any of their units or members.   Making the situation more serious, Galiano said, the law now doesnot require that an article had to be false for it to be a crime. Ifit ``offends'' a member of the military, the journalist who authoredit, can be tried and sentenced.   ``In other words,'' the lawyer said, ``if you write that thesecret police tortured a prisoner, you can be jailed, even if youprove that your report was correct, because accusing someone ofbeing a torturer is certainly an offense.''   The result, Galiano said, is that ``it has become virtuallyimpossible to talk in critical terms of the armed forces.''   Many journalists do take note, however, that the militarygovernment has allowed a marked opening to the Chilean press inrecent months, especially since the Oct. 5 referendum in whichvoters rejected a military proposal that the president and armycommander, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, remain in office until 1997.   ``After the referendum, the government allowed a real opening,including in television,'' La Epoca's Felippi said. ``But therestrictive laws are still there, posing a clear danger.''   Filippi noted that the government announced it is studying a newpress law to streamline and unify the legislation existing now.   ``And that is also very dangerous, because every time new presslegislation was passed under this government, it was to stiffenpenalties and impose new restrictions,'' he said.   On New Year's Eve, the government said it was ordering an end tothe prosecution of journalists, as ``a contribution to the necessaryreconciliation in the country.''   It later explained, however, that the action was limited toprosecution initiated by the Interior Ministry, which deals incivilian cases. Only four journalists, all tried by civilian courts,were favored by the decision. All other trials, including thosebefore military courts, are to continue.   ``The government claims it cannot interfere with those trials,but that's false,'' said Jaime Moreno, president of the JournalistsAssociation. ``We all know that Gen. Pinochet is not only thepresident of the republic, but also the commander of the armedforces and of the army.''   ``As such, he has the decisive word on anything related to themilitary courts,'' Moreno said.   ``What we see here is the lack of a real political will by thegovernment to stop prosecution of journalists.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tue AMs, Jan. 24</NOTE></DOC>
