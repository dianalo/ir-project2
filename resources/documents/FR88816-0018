Background</ITAG>Legislation to authorize Enterprise Zones has been a goal of the Administrationsince its inception. Since 1982, several Enterprise Zone Bills have beenintroduced on behalf of the Administration, providing significant tax incentivesas well as the potential for waiver of Federal regulations.In his 1988 Legislative Message, President Reagan stated: ``More than halfof the states have set up their own enterprise zones, even without Federalincentives. These zones have created new jobs and spurred billions of dollarsin capital investment. Their success is testimony to the power of thisconcept and is just a small indication of how much could be accomplishedif Federal incentives were added to those of States and localities. AddingFederal incentives would make existing zones far more economically attractiveand successful and would also encourage more State and local zones. Accordingly,I am renewing my call to the Congress to take up effective Federal EnterpriseZone legislation which will complement the State Programs.''The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 included Title VII, EnterpriseZone Development, as a new program. As required by the statute, the proposedrule for Title VII was published for comments on June 3, 1988. The 30 daycomment period closed on July 5, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Comments</ITAG>The Department received nineteen public comments in response to the June3, 1988 proposed rule. In addition, a number of telephone calls were received.Several of the commenters and callers raised concern over the requirementof UDAC eligibility for the nominating jurisdiction. Others, concernedbecause designation will be based entirely on rank order of distress, suggestedthat the quality of the Course of Action should be taken into considerationin making the designation. Both of these provisions, however, are so clearlyrequired by the statute that there is no basis for interpretation throughrulemaking.The Secretary is not authorized to designate any zones which have an inadequateCourse of Action. Accordingly, even though the designation will be basedon the rank order of distress, HUD will emphasize the necessity for developmentof a credible local strategy as reflected in the Course of Action.As suggested by one commenter, in evaluating the Course of Action, therule does provide for consideration of the past efforts, as reflected instate enterprise zone designation, as well as effective coordination oflocal, State and Federal efforts. (See andSection; 596.202(C)).One commenter suggested that HUD require that more than four of the coreelements in the Course of Action be required to make the determinationof adequacy. The statute is clear that meeting not less than four of thecore elements constitutes an adequate Course of Action. Therefore, we seeno basis for expansion of this provision through rulemaking.Several commenters suggested that the measurement criteria for the povertyrate be modified so that the average of all census tracts of the nominatedarea meet the poverty criteria. The language of the statute is clear, however,that the requirement applies to ``* * * the poverty rate for <T3>each </T3>populous census tract * * * or equivalent county division''.Accordingly, this provision cannot be modified through rulemaking.One commenter questioned the appropriateness of the ``special assistance''contemplated for HUD programs in support of Enterprise Zones, on the theorythat this would detract from the Enterprise Zone ``Experiment''.HUD could play a useful role in encouraging more intergovernmental cooperationand sharing of ``success'' models from the different States by sponsoringworkshops and conferences, this commenter said. The Department will continueits support of such efforts, but our focus will be on support of the zonesdesignated in accordance with Title VII.Several commenters noted that the Enterprize Zone Program needs Federaltax incentives to maximize a positive influence on businesses in the zone.While having merit, the comment goes well beyond the purview of rulemakingunder Title VII.One commenter noted that the 25-year designation period seems excessive.This period is in the statute and, in any case, is a maximum. The nominatingjurisdiction is free to specify a shorter time period. This commenter alsosuggested that HUD take a leadership role in coordinating other Federalactivities in Enterprise Zones. As a practical matter, HUD has been workingactively with other Federal agencies from whom we have received significantindications of support, and HUD will continue this effort on a zone byzone basis following designation.One State government commented that it was pleased with the Federal government'ssupport of State efforts to revitalize economically distressed communities,and welcomes the opportunity to join in the nomination process.Another State noted its strong support for the Federal enterprise zoneeffort, and raised a question about the population loss criterion. TheState pointed out that more recent data to demonstrate population lossare available than from the 1980 census. However, the statute specifies1970-1980 as the time frame to which the population loss determinationapplies. Accordingly this could only be changed by amending the law andcannot be addressed by rulemaking.The same commenter suggested designation of zones on a semiannual basisover a two-year period, primarily to enable States with relatively newenterprise zone programs to compete effectively. The statute does not requirethat nominated areas be State zones, but rather implies that the basisfor the joint nomination process is to assure State support for zone activities.Nothing precludes States without zone programs from participating. Thiscomment will, however, be taken into consideration before HUD's publicationof the <T4>Federal Register </T4>Notice announcing submission period, deadlinedates and number of zones to be designated in accordance with andSection;596.304.One State is concerned because its State law does not explicitly authorizeapplication for Federal enterprise zones. However such explicit authorizationis not required by Title VII. The requirement is only that the State joinin the nomination by providing support for the Course of Action and certifyingthe eligibility data. This can be done, HUD believes, under general governmentalpowers and should not require State enabling legislation.The same commenter objects to rural areas being ranked separately. Howeverthis is specified in the statute and there is no room for HUD interpretation.One commenter suggested clarification of the one-third rural set-asideto say ``* * * 100 enterprise zones, at least one-third of * * *'' Therule states that there will be ``not less than one-third''. We think thisis clear and have not changed the language in the rule.Several commenters provided suggestions regarding waiver of HUD regulationsand coordination of HUD programs. Except for subject matter which is requiredby statute (and therefore cannot be waived) the provisions of this ruleare broad enough to cover all of the possibilities that have been raised.These suggestions will be very helpful to the department in preparing forcoordination of HUD programs in zones following designation.One commenter misunderstood the requirement for UDAG eligibility for thejurisdiction. If UDAG eligibility is based on a ``pocket of poverty'' designation,the proposed zone could be in or adjacent to the ``pocket of poverty''area, as long as the zone eligibility criteria are met.The same commenter suggested Regional allocations of zones, to attemptto achieve a geographic dispersion. Again, the statute is clear that thedesignations will be based solely on rank order of distress, and accordingly,this suggestion cannot be adopted.Another commenter suggested that the same distress criteria be appliedto both the urban and rural zones_specifically, that zones in each categorybe required to meet only one of the four distress criteria to demonstrateeligibility (unemployment, poverty, income level, population loss). Thelaw specifies that urban areas must meet the poverty and unemployment test,and must satisfy one of the other two criteria. Accordingly, this suggestioncannot be adopted.Another commenter was concerned that rural areas in the State could notmeet the 1.5 unemployment rate and therefore could not be eligible. Thiscomment reflects a misunderstanding of the eligibility criteria for ruralareas. Only one of the four criteria (unemployment, poverty, income level,or population loss) must be met for a rural area to be eligible.One commenter suggested that, with regard to Indian Tribes, the definitionof ``Reservation'' should be changed to add ``off reservation lands'' heldin trust by the Secretary of Interior. Since the statute uses the term``Reservation'' there is no basis for changing the reference in the rule.The same commenter was concerned about the requirement for a ``continuousboundary'' for an Enterprise Zone on an Indian Reservation. Even if a particularreservation does not possess a continuous boundary, an Enterprise Zonemay be so constructed that it does present such a boundary and hence mayqualify for designation.The suggestion was made by this commenter that HUD use data from the Departmentof Interior to compile the employment statistics to be used to rate nominatedareas on Indian Reservations. The regulation currently states in andSection;596.101(d)(1) that ``unemployment will be based upon decennial census dataadjusted by the most recently available annual average unemployment estimates,from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the smallest jurisdiction whichincludes the nominated area.'' We have checked with the Bureau of IndianAffairs concerning the data available on unemployment on Indian Reservationsand found that the data is inconsistent in quality for different Reservations.In addition, the methodology used to derive the data is not standard andis not consistent with that for other areas nationwide. The estimates ofthe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the U.S. Department of Labor arethe only labor force and unemployment data for all nationwide areas derivedusing a uniform standard methodology. Since nominated areas must competewith each other for designation on the basis of these and other criteriaspecified in the legislation, the Department considers it to be especiallyimportant to use data which is available nationwide and is derived usinga standard methodology. Therefore, HUD has decided not to change this provisionof the regulation.Another issue raised by this commenter is that of UDAG eligibility forIndian Reservations, particularly the problem caused by the fact that thoseTribes which never received revenue sharing are ineligible for the UDAGprogram.Section 701(c)(3)(B) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987provides that an area eligible for nomination must be ``located whollywithin the jurisdiction of a local government eligible for assistance undersection 119 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974.'' (section119 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 is the UDAG enablinglegislation). All nominated areas are subject to this requirement includingnominated areas on Indian Reservations. In addition, in determining UDAGeligibility with regard to Indian Tribes, the Department is constrainedby section 14001 (b)(6) of the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Actof 1985 (Pub. L. 99-272), which provides that section 119 (n)(2) of theHousing and Community Development Act of 1974 (the section of the UDAGenabling legislation concerning Indian Tribes) is amended to state thatan eligible applicant <T3>``was </T3>an eligible recipient under Chapter 67 of title 31, U.S.Code (General Revenue Sharing) prior to the repeal of such Chapter.''The same commenter suggested that the regulation should be clarified topermit joint nominations by Tribes and State or local government. Thisis already provided for in the rule. (see andSection; 596.200(a)).Two commenters were concerned that the reference to ``program setasides''referred to preference for minority businesses in contracting. In the Contextof Subpart G_Coordination of Housing and Urban Development Programs, ``programsetasides'' is given as an example of one form of special assistance, andrefers to an allocation of program funds specifically for Enterprise Zones,and does not refer to the contracting process.Crime problems and the homeless population should be considered as evidenceof general distress, one commenter suggested. The regulation states that``general distress shall be evidenced by describing conditions of distressexisting within the area * * * such as abandoned housing, infrastructuredeficiencies, or other appropriate indicators of conditions of generaldistress. HUD agrees these might be ``appropriate indicators of conditionsof general distress'' for some localities.One commenter suggested that size of communities be a basis for allocatingzones, i.e. small SMSA, large SMSA, and Non-SMSA. However, the statuteprovides only for the one-third rural setaside. Accordingly, there is nobasis for additional allocation requirements through rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Addition to Final Rule</ITAG>In the proposed rule, andSection; 596.400 Monitoring, was reserved. Followingdiscussions within the Department, the following section now is being includedin the final rule:Section 596.400 MonitoringHUD's role in monitoring Enterprise Zone activity will be kept to the minimumnecessary to determine compliance with the State and local commitmentsmade in accordance with andSection; 596.200(4) or (for an Indian Reservation)the assurance required by andSection; 596.201(b). Monitoring will be carriedout in conjunction with ongoing CPD activities in the community, e.g.,CDBG monitoring visits.The rationale for this approach is that since the Secretary is authorizedto revoke an Enterprise Designation (andSection; 596.401), a process mustbe in place to determine whether conditions exist that would trigger revocation.At the same time, the Department does not want to place an undue burdenon either the HUD field office or on Enterprise Zone designees.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Other Matters</ITAG>A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR Part 50, which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42U.S.C. 4332. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for publicinspection and copying during regular business hours in the Office of theRules Docket Clerk, Room 10278, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC20410.This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of the Executive Order on Federal Regulation issued bythe President on February 17, 1981. Analysis of the rule indicated thatit does not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovations, or the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic exportmarkets. If Congress passes tax legislation to augment the authority underwhich this rule is promulgated, the implementing rule for such legislationwould constitute a major economic impact and the Department would preparea Regulatory Impact Analysis at that time.The information collection requirements contained in Part 596 of this rulehave been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review underthe Paperwork Reduction Act. No person may be subjected to penalty forfailure to comply with the information collection requirements containedin Part 596 until they have been approved and assigned an OMB control number.The OMB control number, when assigned, will be announced in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the Undersignedhereby certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. While the Enterprise Zone Programwill permit small entities to apply for designation and to benefit fromtheir participation in the program, the impact on these entities is a functionof the operation of Title VII of the Housing and Community DevelopmentAct of 1987, and is not caused by the rulemaking, which merely providesthe machinery for designations of zones under the statutory criteria.This rule is not listed in the Department's semiannual agenda of regulationspublished on April 25, 1988 (53 FR 13854), under Executive Order 12291and the Regulatory Flexibility Act at 49 FR 15960.<ITAG tagnum="21">A catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program number for the EnterpriseZone Development Program is 14.233.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 596</ITAG>Enterprise zones, Economic development, Housing and urban development,Community development.Accordingly, the Department adds a new 24 CFR Part 596, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 596_ENTERPRISE ZONE DEVELOPMENT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_General Provisions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.1 Applicability and scope.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.2 Objective and purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.3 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.4 Secretarial review and enterprise zone designation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.5 Waivers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.6 Consultation with other federal agencies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Area Requirements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.100 General.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.101 Eligibility requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_State and Local Government Actions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.200 Nominations by State and local governments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.201 Nomination of Indian reservations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.202 Course of action.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart D_Zone Designation Process</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.300 Nomination for designation of an enterprise zone.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.301 HUD action and review of nominations for zone designation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.302 Selection factors for designation of nominated zones.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.303 Zone designation in rural areas.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.304 Number of zones designated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart E_Post Zone Designation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.400 Monitoring.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.401 Revocation of enterprise zone designation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.402 Evaluation and reporting.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart F_Waiver or Modification of Rules</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.500 Requests for waivers or modifications.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.501 Waiver or modification of HUD rules in enterprise zones.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart G_Coordination of Housing and Urban Development Programs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">596.600 Coordination of HUD programs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> Title VII, Housing and Community Development Act of1987 (42 U.S.C. 11501-11505); Sec. 7(d), Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_General Provisions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 596.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Applicability and scope.</ITAG>(a) This part covers policies and procedures applicable to enterprise zonesauthorized under Title VII of the Housing and Urban Development Act of1987, (Pub.
