The Department has now completedthat administrative review in accordance with section 751(a) of the TariffAct of 1930 (``the Tariff Act'').<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Review </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of Customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule(HTS) as provided for in section 1201 et seq. of the Omnibus Trade andCompetitiveness Act of 1988. All merchandise entered, or withdrawn fromwarehouse, for consumption on or after that date is now classified solelyaccording to the appropriate HTS item number(s). Imports covered by this review are shipments of Pakistani cotton shop towels.During the review period, such merchandise was classifiable under itemnumber 366.2840 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated.This merchandise is currently classifiable under HTS item number 6307.10.20.The HTS item number is provided for convenience and Customs purposes. Thewritten description remains dispositive. The review covers the period April 1, 1984 through December 31, 1985 andsix programs: (I) Export Financing Scheme; (2) Compensatory Rebate Scheme;(3) Excise Tax, Sales Tax and Customs Duty Rebate programs; (4) IncomeTax Reductions for Exports; (5) Import Duty Rebate; and (6) Export CreditGuarantee Scheme. <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments Received </ITAG>We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminaryresults. We received comments from counsel for the exporters of shop towelsfrom Pakistan. <T3>Comment 1: </T3>The exporters contend that, in calculating the benefitfrom the export financing scheme, the Department failed to take into accounta 100 rupee stamp tax charged on all export loans. The 100 rupee tax, whichis not charged on the commercial loans used to establish the benchmark,amounts to an additional cost to the exporter and reduces the benefit fromthis program determined by the Department in the preliminary results. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree. We have revised our calculationsaccordingly and determine the benefit from this program to be 1.40 percent<T3>ad valorem </T3>for the 1984 period and 2.33 percent ad valorem for1985. <T3>Comment 2: </T3>The exporters contest the Department's determinationthat the Government of Pakistan failed to provide any documentation linkingthe amount of the excise tax, sales tax, and customs duty rebates to actualindirect taxes borne by shop towels. The exporters argue that the verificationreport, and calculations based on a 1980 survey that were submitted inthe questionnaire response, indicate that linkage does exist between taxespaid and taxes refunded and that the tax incidence was calculated withprecision. Finally, the exporters claim that the questionnaire responseand statements made during verification are the best information available,and the Department should accept the calculations that were submitted andfind the refunds to be non-excessive rebates of indirect taxes. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. In deciding whether a taxrebate program provides a countervailable benefit, the Department askstwo questions. First, does the requisite linkage between the payment andthe indirect tax incidence exist? Second, is the payment less than, equalto, or greater than the indirect tax on the exported product? <T3>See Certain Apparel from Argentina; Final Results of CountervailingDuty Administrative Review </T3>(53 FR 1053; January 15, 1988).In its questionnaire response, the Government of Pakistan provided a completeand extensive response to questions concerning this program. At verification,we were provided with a lengthy verbal explanation of the program and theprocess by which the government establishes the various tax rebate rates.However, the Pakistani government did not provide any of the supportingdocumentation to the 1980 survey that we requested in order to verify thecost structure and cost matrices used to derive the various tax rebaterates. Due to disturbances in Karachi during verification, which createdlogistical problems for providing documentation, we allowed the Pakistanigovernment additional time to submit the requested documentation afterverification and prior to publication of the preliminary results. However,no documentation was submitted. Without this documentation, we were unableto verify the requisite linkage and determine whether the rebates duringthis review period were less than, equal to, or greater than the indirecttax incidence on shop towels. Therefore, the Department determines thefull amount of the three rebates to be countervailable. <T3>Comment 3: </T3>The exporters argue that, with respect to the incometax reductions for exports, the Department incorrectly used the highestbenefit reported by any one company in the questionnaire response and appliedthat rate, as the best information available (``BIA''), to all other companies.They contend that use of the highest benefit reported to obtain a BIA rateis excessively punitive and is not in accordance with section 776 of theTariff Act of I930, as amended (``the Tariff Act''), (19 U.S.C. 1677e).The exporters state that the Department applied section 776(c), which isan ``exception to the general rule'' articulated in section 776(b) andwhich allows the Department to disregard information in the questionnaireresponse in the event that the respondent significantly impedes the investigation.Events in Karachi at the time of verification, which were outside the controlof the Pakistani government and the companies under review, prevented thecollection and verification of information pertinent to this program. Theverified companies cooperated to the fullest extent possible under thecircumstances. Furthermore, the other data submitted by the exporters subjectto verification were verified as correct. Therefore, the use of section776(c), which should be used to penalize uncooperative respondents, isinappropriate. The fact that one number out of many could not be ``proved''should not be a reason to penalize all companies by resorting to informationfrom one company and applying it to all others. The Department should usethe income tax reductions reported for each company in the questionnaireresponse. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. In our final affirmative countervailingduty determination, we stated that, even after verification, we were unableto obtain complete information on this program. Therefore, we used thebest information available, which consisted of information from the petition.<T3>See Cotton Shop Towels from Pakistan; Final Affirmative CountervailingDuty Determination </T3>(49 FR 1408, January 11, l984). In the first administrativereview of this countervailing duty order, the Pakistani government submittedan incomplete response to the questionnaire. Once again, the Departmentrelied on the best information available for this program which consistedof the results in our final determination. See Cotton Shop Towels fromPakistan; Final Results of Administrative Review of Countervailing DutyOrder (51 FR 5219, February 12, 1986). Faced with an explanation of theoperation of this program which could not be tied to verifiable informationfrom companies with whom we were able to conduct verifications, we hadno choice but to use again the best information available. Contrary to the exporters' belief, section 776(c) of the Tariff Act isnot an ``exception'' to the best information available rule. Subsections(b) and (c) of section 776 simply identify two different kinds of testsfor verification failure, yet they bring about an identical response fromthe Department, the use of the best information available. Furthermore,the Department makes no differentiation between these two types of testsin the Commerce Regulations on verification, but combines the languagein both (19 CFR 353.51(b)) (See also, 355.37 of the Commerce Regulationspublished in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 27, 1988 (53 FR 52306) (to be codifiedat 19 CFR 355.22)). In addition, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuithas frequently recognized the Department's broad discretion in the useof the best information available. <T3>See Atlantic Sugar, Ltd. v. United States, </T3>744 F. 2d 1556 (Fed.Cir. 1984). In accordance with the statute, we applied the highest income tax reductionbenefit reported by any one company as the best information available forthe benefit from this program. <ITAG tagnum="84">Final Results of Review </ITAG>After considering all comments received, we determine the net subsidy tobe 15.06 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for the period April 1, 1984 through December 31, 1984,and 16.61 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for the period January 1, 1985 through December 31,1985. The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess countervailingduties of 15.06 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments ofthis merchandise exported on or after April 1, 1984 and on or before December31, 1984. The Department will also instruct the Customs Service to assesscountervailing duties of 16.61 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on allshipments of this merchandise exported on or after January 1, 1985 andon or before December 31, 1985. Further, due to the termination of the Compensatory Rebate Scheme, theDepartment will instruct the Customs Service to collect cash deposits ofestimated countervailing duties of 8.49 percent of f.o.b. invoice priceon all shipments of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice. Thisdeposit requirement shall remain in effect until publication of the finalresults of the next administrative review. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1)of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and andSection; 355.22 of the CommerceRegulations published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> on December 27, 1988 (53 FR 52306) (to be codifiedat 19 CFR 355.22). <ITAG tagnum="6">Timothy N.
