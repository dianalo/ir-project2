Four months after a judge ruled that Samuel Thomas should besent back to Nicaragua, he remains at the Krome Avenue detentioncenter. He's even willing to buy his own ticket back to Managua,the Nicaraguan capital.   ``I can't stand it. I'm desperate to see my family,'' saidThomas, 31. ``I want to go, but they don't want to send me.''   Of the dozen or so Nicaraguans at Krome, Thomas is the only onewho wants to go back, he said.   Thomas' case is bogged down in Washington, where it is underreview by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and theJustice Department.   Since 1987, it has been standard for Nicaraguans' deportationorders to be checked by Justice Department officers to giveasylum-seekers an extra level of review before they're forced outof the country, said Ken Powers, assistant director of deportationfor the Miami district of INS.   ``I would have to admit it's bureaucracy,'' Powers said ofThomas' situation. ``We've added additional steps to protect therights of Nicaraguans going to back to Nicaragua. This process isvery cumbersome.''   But added Powers, ``It's ridiculous to have the system prevent aguy from going back.''   Thomas arrived March 15 at Miami International Airport with avalid visa but without documentation as a cruise ship employee. Heinitially asked for asylum at the airport but dropped that by thetime he had a hearing April 11.   The INS ruled him excludable, and Thomas didn't appeal.   At that point, Powers said, even though it had been noted inThomas' file that he wanted to be deported, his records wereshipped to Washington along with those of people fightingdeportation.</TEXT></DOC>
