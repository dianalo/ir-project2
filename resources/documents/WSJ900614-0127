Many Democrats believe they should be bashing PresidentBush and the Republicans for causing and mishandling thenation's biggest financial scandal. &quot;It's the biggest issue Ican see for us against Bush,&quot; says Rep. Dan Glickman (D.,Kan.).</LP><TEXT>   The issue resonates with the voters. &quot;I have not done atown meeting where this hasn't been a major focus ofattention,&quot; says Rep. Thomas Downey (D., N.Y.). &quot;I amastonished by the level of interest, but more horrified bythe level of anger. This is a political issue of the veryfirst magnitude and it's going to bite somebody hard.&quot;   But, so far, the Democrats have remained mostly passive inwhat seems to be a ready-made issue for them. When TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady went before the Senate BankingCommittee recently to concede that his agency had grosslyunderestimated the cost of the thrift-rescue plan, Bushadministration aides were astounded -- and relieved -- tofind questioning by the panel's Democrats so tame.   The reason? In the public mind, the Democrats are at leastas culpable in the Sandamp;L mess as the Republicans. Four of the&quot;Keating Five&quot; senators under investigation for interveningon behalf of Sandamp;L kingpin Charles Keating are Democrats,including the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee,Donald Riegel of Michigan. And former House Speaker JamesWright and former House Banking Committee Chairman FerdinandSt Germain both were ruined politically after allegations ofclose ties with thrift executives.   &quot;I don't believe that either party is totally without sinon the issue,&quot; says Rep. Thomas Carper (D., Del.).   As a result, Republicans doubt the $100 billion-pluscrisis will rub off on them exclusively. &quot;A thumbnail sketchof the history of the Sandamp;L crisis has a veritable rogues'gallery of Democratic leaders in it,&quot; says John Buckley, aRepublican strategist.   Instead, incumbents of either stripe may well be victimsof the Sandamp;L fallout. &quot;It is best as an outsider-vs.-insiderissue, as opposed to a Democrat-vs.-Republican issue,&quot; saysHarrison Hickman, a Democratic consultant.   &quot;It's bad for everybody,&quot; agrees Sen. John Breaux (D.,La.), chairman of the Senate Democrats' campaign committee.&quot;It's bad for incumbents.&quot;   &quot;It's going to be a very salient issue in the fall,&quot;predicts Roger Stone, a Republican consultant. &quot;Incumbentsbeware]&quot;   In particular, the Sandamp;L bailout is expected to play a rolein the re-election contests this year of Democratic Rep.Frank Annunzio of Illinois, a senior member of the HouseBanking Committee, and of GOP Rep. Charles Pashayan ofCalifornia, who accepted and then later returned a campaigncontribution from a group run by Mr. Keating.   Still, a growing number of Democrats believe their partyshould try to use the thrift crisis against the Republicans.Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraskaand Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York make criticism of the Sandamp;Lbailout part of their stump speeches. Last week at New YorkState's Democratic Party convention in Albany, Gov. Cuomoexcoriated the Republicans for allowing thrift executives to&quot;do what they want to do.&quot; The result, he said, was that&quot;they stole everything in sight. They fouled up everything insight and now you're paying for it.&quot;   Other Democrats are taking this same line of attack. TheSandamp;L situation &quot;is going to be one of the most importantissues of the campaign,&quot; says Rep. Vic Fazio (D., Calif.).&quot;If there's a political price to be paid, and there will be,&quot;he adds, &quot;I don't think those bills are going to come due forDemocrats.&quot;   There is some reason for Democrats to be sanguine thatthey can direct voter anger at the GOP. Many of them say thatthe thrift industry's basic problems stem from the Reaganadministration's emphasis on deregulation and itsunwillingness to budget an adequate number of governmentauditors. In addition, they note that Mr. Bush was at thecenter of the issue; as vice president he headed Mr. Reagan'stask force on deregulation.   What's more, the most recent setbacks in the bailout --especially its ever-escalating cost -- are easily laid at thefeet of the Bush administration, Democrats say.&quot;Responsibility for what happened in the past is somewhatshared,&quot; says Rep. Barney Frank (D., Mass.). &quot;But since {lastyear's bailout} bill passed they have done a very poor job ofadministering it. . . . It's been a real screw-up.&quot;   Few believe the Sandamp;L problem is much better now than whenthe president won the legislation he sought last year toclean up the mess. And Democrats have begun to target theirbarbs at what they see as shortcomings of that enterprise.These include the Justice Department's slowness inprosecuting thrift executives and the Treasury's long-delayedsale of confiscated assets.   Some congressional Democrats warn that the Bushadministration's request for more bailout money will berejected unless the deposit-insurance system is overhauled ina populist way, including placing lower limits on the amountof deposits that are federally insured. This would serve toput a Democratic stamp on the solution. What's more,Democratic-led efforts are under way in both the Senate andthe House to force the administration to spend more than itwants to prosecute savings-and-loan criminals.   &quot;This is worse than Watergate,&quot; asserts Rep. Annunzio ofthe House Banking Committee. His subcommittee on financialinstitutions, which already has grilled the president's sonNeil about his directorship of a failed Colorado thrift, hasscheduled other hearings for later this year.   But it isn't clear that the Democrats can succeed infulfilling their political aspirations with the issue. &quot;Theproblem we have as Democrats,&quot; concludes Rep. Bruce Vento(D., Minn.), &quot;is that a few Democrats stuck their noses inwhere they didn't belong.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
