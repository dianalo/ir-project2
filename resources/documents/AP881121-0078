The Pakistan People's Party, led by Ms. Bhutto, captured thelargest bloc of votes in Wednesday's national election but fellshort of a majority in the National Assembly.   Ms. Bhutto, who has said she expects to be the country's newprime minister, is seeking the support of elected independent andsmaller parties to form a governing majority.   She met today with Altaf Hussain, leader of the Mohajir QuamiMovement, which came in third in the election and represents ethnicIndian Moslem immigrants.   Wasim Sajjad, minister for justice and parliamentary affairs,announced today that President Ghulam Ishaq Khan intends to persuadeMs. Bhutto and her conservative rival Nawaz Sharif to unite in acoalition government. Sajjad said Khan will meet separately with thetwo leaders Tuesday.   A government spokesman, who requested anonymity, said ``thediscussion with the two major party leaders will be to form abroad-based government. It's only natural.''   But Ms. Bhutto said she will not accept a coalition with Sharif,whose Islamic Democratic Alliance was second in the election,officials said.   Last week's vote, the first free elections in Pakistan since1977, had no majority winner.   Ms. Bhutto's party won 93 seats in the 237-member NationalAssembly, compared to 55 for the right-wing Islamic DemocraticAlliance led by Sharif. The remaining 68 seats contested went toindependents, minor parties and non-Moslem candidates.   Ms. Bhutto, 35, says she has enough recruits among newly electedmembers of the National Assembly to command a majority in thechamber, and expects the president to ask her party to form the newgovernment.   In voting for provincial assembly seats on Saturday, Ms. Bhutto'sparty was only able to obtain an outright majority in one of thecountry's four provinces.   She virtually swept her home province of Sind in southernPakistan. But in the heavily populated Punjab province, where 60percent of the country's 107 million people live, the majority wentto the right-wing alliance.   In Pakistan, the Senate, National Assembly and the fourprovincial assemblies elect the president, who is head of state. Thepresident, in turn, has the power to name the prime minister.   However, the Constitution has two clauses on naming a primeminister.   One gives the president discretion both in timing and selectionof a prime minister. The other, originally meant to apply toelections held after 1990, requires the new legislature to convenefirst and the person with the majority of votes to head thegovernment.   Ms. Bhutto maintains that the 1990 provision applies to thecurrent situation. Pakistan's military leader, Gen. Mohammed Ziaul-Haq, had added the 1990 provision to the Constitution afterdeciding he would continue as president with the powers to decideprime minister until 1990.   Zia died in a plane crash Aug. 17, just weeks after callingnational elections. Zia ousted Bhutto's father, former PrimeMinister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in a bloodless 1977 coup and hadBhutto executed two years later.</TEXT></DOC>
