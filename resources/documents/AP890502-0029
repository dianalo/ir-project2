The new rate, which took effect Monday, will be 7.81 percent, upfrom the rate of 7.35 percent that had been in effect over the pastsix months. The new rate is the highest return for savers since thebonds earned 8.36 percent for the sx-month period ending in April1986.   Interest on savings bonds is adjusted twice a year on May 1 andNov. 1 to reflect open market rates. The rate is based on 85percent of the yield on five-year Treasury securities, which haveaveraged 9.19 percent over the past six months.   Since the government switched to market rates for savings bondsin November 1982, the rate of return has averaged 8.29 percent.Investors who hold their bonds for at least five years earn theaverage of the half-year rtes.   Jerrold B. Speers, executive director of the savings bondprogram, called the new rate ``terrific news for savers.''   ``When looked at in combination of the other benefits of bonds _including tax advantages, complete safety against loss, ease ofpurchase _ it is clear that this new rate makes savings bonds anunbeatable deal,'' Speers said.   Investors are guaranteed a minimum interest rate, regardless ofwhat the market rates do. That minimum guaranteed rate is currently6 percent. But for bonds purchased before Nov. 1, 1986, the minimumis 7.5 percent.   Since market rates for bonds were introduced, the rates haveranged from a high of 10.94 percent for the six months beginning inNovember 1984 to a low of 5.84 percent for the six months beginningin May 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
