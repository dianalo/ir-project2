Like traders atPaineWebber in New York and Robinson Humphrey in Atlanta, Mr.Meiser said that sellers dominated activity much of the daybefore buyers ventured back in during the afternoon.</LP><TEXT>   Though the bargain hunters trimmed the day's worst losses,the OTC market failed to rebound into positive territory asNew York Stock Exchange issues did. The Nasdaq CompositeIndex fell to its lowest level since June 27, dropping 2.65,or 0.58%, to 458.17; it had been down about six points atmidday. Volume was a brisk 182.6 million shares, anddeclining stocks outpaced advancing issues 1,116 to 791.   Lotus was the most active OTC issue, plummeting 6 1/8 to25 1/8 on 10.3 million shares; it didn't recover much fromits day's low of 24. The Cambridge, Mass., software concernshocked analysts Wednesday by announcing its third-quarterearnings may fall short of year-earlier profit.   Apple Computer also contributed heavily to thetechnology-stock dive, falling 2 7/8 to 41 3/4 on 5.2 millionshares; it traded as low as 40. The Cupertino, Calif.,computer maker cautioned analysts that earnings in itscurrent fiscal fourth quarter might trail year-earlierresults.   Though other technology companies didn't join in thedisappointment chorus, their stocks were hammered, too. SunMicrosystems fell 3/4 to 34; Conner Peripherals lost 1/2 to29 3/4; Intel sank 3/4 to 47 3/4; Seagate Technology fell 5/8to 13 5/8, and Autodesk dropped 7/8 to 56 5/8.   The Nasdaq Industrial Index, which includes mosttechnology shares, lost 4.07 to 496.59, or 0.8%, recoveringfrom a midday low of 493.32. That index just reached anall-time high of 510.61 on Monday.   Despite the heavy selling, managers of OTC and technologyportfolios at several mutual funds said they don't believethe day's losses signal a long-term setback for technologyissues.   &quot;It's a typical correction in the land of technology,&quot;said Richard Frucci, senior vice president for PutnamInformation Sciences Trust in Boston. &quot;I don't think it willlead the market down,&quot; he said, adding that he still expectstechnology issues this year will outperform both the NasdaqComposite Index and the larger Standard andamp; Poor's 500 Index.   Alan Radlo, portfolio manager of the $734 million FidelityOTC Portfolio, said he believed the day's sellers consistedof a number of investors who climbed onto the technologybandwagon late in its mid-year climb to levels well above thebroader Nasdaq Composite and Sandamp;P indexes.   &quot;I think it's a setback for people who threw money {attechnology stocks} and didn't know what they own,&quot; he said.&quot;You get these whipsaws and they're expected.&quot;   Like Roger McNamee, manager of the T. Rowe Price Scienceand Technology Fund, Mr. Radlo said he was taking advantageof the overall decline in technology issues to buy some ofhis favorite stocks.   However, analysts said they don't expect Lotus's shares tobounce back soon. Cowen andamp; Co. analyst Michele Preston saidshe expects Lotus to recover next year as it introduces newversions of its 1-2-3 spreadsheet software. After yesterday'sdrop, she said, the stock is selling at a relatively low ninetimes her 1991 earnings estimate of $2.60 a share, which shelowered yesterday from $2.90 previously. Ms. Preston said shelowered her Lotus earnings estimate for 1990 to $2.10 a sharefrom $2.30 previously.   Goldman Sachs analyst Rick Sherlund said in an interviewhe is maintaining his &quot;sell&quot; recommendation on Lotus anddoesn't expect the software developer to recover until itbrings out a version of its spreadsheet software that iscompatible with the well-received new Windows 3.0 softwarerecently introduced by Microsoft. The analyst added that hedoesn't expect Lotus to introduce that product until themiddle of next year and predicts &quot;the market will pass it by&quot;until the new version is available.   Despite yesterday's sell-off, analysts say they don'texpect technology stocks to follow the pattern of recentyears: good performance until mid-year, followed byunderperformance for the remainder of the year, causedlargely by a seasonal slowdown in business.   This year will be different, analysts assert.   &quot;We're about to embark on one of the most important newproduct cycles in the industry's history,&quot; said Ms. Prestonof Cowen, though that transition will bring both good and badnews. Companies such as Apple and Lotus may stumble as theyadapt to the transition, she said. But in 12 to 18 months,with new products on the market, she expects growth at thosecompanies to accelerate.   Leading the way in the new product cycle is Microsoft,with its much-touted Windows 3.0 software. The software isbased on what is known in computer jargon as &quot;graphical userinterface,&quot; or the use of pictures, rather than characters,on computer screens to guide users.   &quot;Going from the character mode to the graphics mode is abig hurdle,&quot; agrees Mr. Sherlund of Goldman Sachs. He addsthat companies such as Lotus will have to scramble to come upwith products that adapt to the new standards.   &quot;Rapid and evolutionary and revolutionary changes areoccurring in technology,&quot; said Mr. Radlo, adding that hebelieves U.S. companies are in the forefront of those changesand will benefit, particularly next year, as the new productsare introduced and sold overseas.   But companies with good earnings news weren't punishedindiscriminately. American Ecology rose 2 to 10 1/4. TheAgoura Hills, Calif., waste disposal company Wednesdayreported net income for the second quarter of 57 cents ashare, compared with a loss a year earlier of 94 cents.   SynOptics Communications rose 1 7/8 to 59 after the makerof computer network systems surprised analysts with secondquarter net income of 34 cents a share, up from 13 cents ayear earlier.   ---   Craig S.
