That, explains respected Annex Research commentator RobertDjurdjevic, is because there is a war going on in IBM between the EnterpriseSystems Group and the sales force: the former believes that adding fibreoptic cabling to the existing Js will give users enough of a boost to keepthem happy, while the people at the sharp end in the salesforce want the gutsof the J repackaged in a new cabinet with new plumbing and power supplies ina configuration that would provide a smaller footprint and use less power -and each side is talking its book to the customers, who are not surprisinglyconfused; and although IBM says that users are telling it they want betteroffice automation, computer-integrated manufacturing, image and transactionprocessing, larger networks, data security and easier systems management -and that it intends to address those demands - according to Computer SystemsNews, Gartner Group says it is hearing a different story from IBM users,namely that they are effectively being offered a total 7% improvement inperformance between 1988 and 1991, and they reckon they deserve rather more.andM;- o -andM;Having controversially bundled its Rdb database with the VMS operating systemlast year, DEC is reportedly set to do the same thing with Ultrix and theIngres 6.0 relational database, which is sold under the name Ultrix/SQL: DECis set to launch its new range of DECstation 5000 RISC systems today, April3, and is not expected to be able to match IBM's RS/6000s in raw processingpower - the top model is tipped to do 24 MIPS against 27 MIPS for the RS/6000320 and 34.5 MIPS for the 530; as a result, DEC is expected to highlight thefact that its machines are desktop rather than desk-side, and claim that theyoffer better graphics; DEC's R3000 RISC-based DECstations may also outperformthe IBM machines in commercial applications, while losing out in rawscientific performance.andM;- o -andM;ICL has gone across the Channel for a laptop computer, picking up Bull SA'sZenith Data Systems SuperSport 80286 machine: ICL will offer it as the PT286vand will offer it at from #2,700 with 12MHz 80286 CPU, 1Mb of memory and 3.5&quot;floppy disk.andM;- o -andM;DEC is reportedly considering the possibility of licensing its forthcomingDECnet Phase V networking software to other vendors to run on non-DEC kit,hears Digital Review DECnet Phase V supports use of Open SystemsInterconnection protocols.andM;- o -andM;Seems that the downgrading of its forecast for STC Plc by Kleinwort Bensonhad more to do with the expectation of lower orders for STC from BritishTelecommunications Plc than from anything nasty it discovered in the ICLwoodshed on its visit last week to the STC computer systems subsidiary (CI No1,397).andM;- o -andM;US and Japanese trade negotiators reached agreement on further liberalisationof Japan's telecommunications market when the Japanese bowed to US demandsthat it liberalise the market for termination equipment and ease restrictiverules on approving foreign equipment; the two are also close to agreement ontrade in satellites.andM;- o -andM;The US Department of Defense is to relinquish its right to review exports ofsmaller personal computers, telecommunications equipment and medicalelectronic equipment to the Comecon countries including the Soviet Union: forthe goods covered, the Commerce Department will be the sole arbitor on exportlicences - which should speed the process.andM;- o -andM;Following the acquisition of its distributor there, Power andamp;
