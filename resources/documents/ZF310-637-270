Furthermore, if two cameras are used, one must havea genlock feature to accept timing from the other.andP;  Similarly, you'll need aclean signal if you want to use the Toaster's titling features to add fixed,scrolling and &quot;crawling&quot; (horizontally scrolling) titles to your Mac imagesand to reliably grab the highest-quality images.andM;Just as in professional video production, if you attach two additional videomonitors to your Toaster, you can see both a program (current output) and apreview (video ready for a transition).andP;  The Toaster screen serves as thecontrol window.andP;  You can get by with one extra monitor in a more awkwardtwo-monitor configuration, but it's not worth the savings.andM;Toaster upstream.andP;  Because the Toaster's signal is clean enough even forbroadcast use, you won't need as much hardware to use the Toaster as anupstream source.andM;The Toaster's still-image capture and display rivals professional units (eachimage is a full four-field store to capture complete picture-timing andcolor-phasing information) and can serve as an excellent source for overlays,graphics and backgrounds for Mac graphics.andP;  You can archive and retrievecaptured images on a one-by-one and project basis.andM;The bundled software seemed a bit crude compared with the polish we expect ofMac programs, but it does the job, and the Amiga painting, modeling,animation and rendering programs included with the system are about aspowerful as popular Mac applications.andP;  A future upgrade will allow users todo more work with Mac software (see story, this page).andM;With a little skill and practice, images from the Toaster's software can beexquisite.andP;  But like all personal computer-based animation and renderingsystems, you can't expect real-time rendering and animation for complexfigures.andP;  For production-oriented work, such as cartooning and architecturalpresentations, you'd need multiple machines or a lot of all-night renderingsessions.andM;Based mainly on user-interface issues, you might not want to switch to theToaster for all your image creation.andP;  But you'll find it makes an excellentimage source, especially when your Mac is tied up with coordinating theproduction or controlling an edit.andM;A hybrid system.andP;  Admittedly, it would make it much easier for Mac users ifNewTek would build a Mac-compatible card with all the Toaster's functions.andO;But if you're enough of an experimenter to consider a hybrid system, thereare several ways to control the Toaster from your Mac desktop.andP;  We inspectedseveral working systems that used these methods but did not attempt toconstruct equivalents of our own from scratch.andM;At the simplest level, the Toaster accepts a General Purpose Interface Bus(GPIB) trigger as a signal to execute an effect that's set up and waiting.andO;Macs have no GPIB output, but a serial-to-parallel converter or a laboratoryinstrument controller can generate one from the Mac's serial output.andM;More-advanced hackers can send series of macros to the Toaster.andP;  The Toasterswitcher program (as well as some but not all of the graphics programs)accept commands in the Amiga Arex language, which can be generated on a Macby a custom program and sent from machine to machine over a serialconnection.andM;Finally, by combining Amiga programs that turn Musical Instrument DigitalInterface signals into mouse movements along with Macintosh programs thatgenerate MIDI commands, a Mac-based sequencer can treat the Amiga-Toastercombination as a video peripheral in a combination audio and videoproduction.andM;Conclusions.andP;  Eventually, there will be affordable Mac systems that providethe video capabilities of the Toaster, but none announced so far comes closeto the Toaster performance or price.andP;  Even Radius Inc.'s Collage engine,which the company plans to sell only on an OEM basis for a price closer to$10,000, doesn't match the Toaster for bundled software and basic features.andM;Adding a NewTek Video Toaster can greatly increase your desktop-videooptions, but at the added cost of supporting another hardware and softwaresystem.andP;  If you're willing to accept the complexity of a hybrid system alongwith some inconsistencies and quirks in the software -- and that's a big &quot;if&quot;-- you'll find the Amiga-based Toaster a valuable component in a compositevideo system.andM;NewTek Inc. is at 215 E. Eighth St., Topeka, Kan.andP;  66603.andP;  Phone (913)354-1146 or (800) 843-8934.andM;Video ToasterandM;NewTek Inc.andM;The Amiga-based Video Toaster offers some very good video-manipulationfeatures not available on any comparable Mac-based system, and at a veryattractive price.andP;  It can be used as an NTSC source for a Mac and as a deviceswitcher for manipulating Mac-produced images.andP;  Using an Amiga product in aMac setup means supporting another hardware-and-software system; controlsbetween the Toaster and the Mac are still in the do-it-yourself experimentalstage.andM;NewTek describes its Amiga-based video switcher and special-effects system asthe &quot;world's first desktop television studio,&quot; and television and cablenetworks -- including ABC, NBC, CBS and MTV -- and corporate videodepartments at companies such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and Bausch andamp; Lomb havefound a few desks to put it on.andM;&quot;To be a desktop television studio,&quot; said Mark Randall, NewTek director ofmarketing, &quot;andlsqb;the Toasterandrsqb; must do video switching, digital-video effects,character generation for titling, freeze images and save them, paintgraphics, 3-D animation, and have multiple inputs to video.&quot;andM;The Toaster does all that, and at at a price &quot;unheard of&quot; by most videoprofessionals, according to Nick Arnett, president of Multimedia ComputingCorp., a research firm in Santa Clara, Calif.andP;  &quot;There is nothing like it onthe Mac yet, and you can't really get those video effects anywhere at thatprice.&quot;andM;Mac-based video-editing systems, such as Digital F/X Inc.'s $10,000 Video F/Xsystem, allow users to edit on-line from the desktop (see MacWEEK, April 9).andO;For Mac users, the Toaster complements current on-line and off-line editingsystems, according to Arnett and Tony Bove, editor of the Bove andamp; RhodesInside Report on Multimedia and Desktop Publishing in Gualala, Calif.andM;&quot;The Amiga with the Toaster is a video-effects system that can take a videosignal from the Mac,&quot; said Bove.andP;  &quot;But I would expect there will be productslike it that will be Mac-based so users will have an all-in-desktop systemwithout having to learn the Amiga.&quot;andM;NewTek last week announced a stand-alone version of the system that does notrequire users to own or buy an Amiga.andP;  To sell for $3,995 when it ships inJune, the new Toaster also will be able to read Mac PICT, EncapsulatedPostScript and 3-D file formats directly, unlike the existing Toaster, whichcan only accept Mac-generated graphics that have been converted to NTSCformat.andM;&quot;With the new Toaster, people don't have to worry about getting anothercomputer platform,&quot; Randall said.andP;  &quot;It will hook up to the Mac, so users witha video-editing system will have everything they need on the desktop to dobroadcast-quality video.&quot; -- By Connie Guglielmo</TEXT></DOC>
