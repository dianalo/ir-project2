The minister, Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi, told the Al-Watannewspaper that Iraq would not rule out increasing its output from2.7 million barrels a day as part of an effort to rebuild itsshattered economy after eight years of war with Iran.   Iraq has refused to abide by a quota of 1.5 million barrels aday set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesbecause its Persian Gulf enemy has been allowed to produce 2.3million barrels a day.   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto has held talks with severalmembers of the cartel recently, including Iran, who are opposed toraising Iraq's official quota to parity with Iran.   However, the newspaper Thursday said Chalabi's latest statementsindicate Baghdad no longer is interested in gaining parity withIran or in accepting any assigned quota.   ``We sacrificed and lost a lot in the eight years of hostilitiesduring which we could not produce our output quota,'' the ministerwas quoted as saying.   ``Therefore, we are not prepared to sacrifice more as we nowhave our construction commitments and debt which we should repay.''   The minister declined to estimate by how much Iraq mightincrease its oil exports, saying it would ``depend to a largeextent on the state of our ports.''   ``But our output will be larger when the second stage of theIraqi-Saudi pipeline is completed in September 1989,'' he said.   The pipeline to the Red Sea and another via Turkey to theMediterranean were oil export outlets Iraq used after its portswere damaged and shipments through the gulf blocked by the war.   Oil prices have risen sharply in recent days after a steadydecline in previous weeks prompted by fears of a world oversupplyof oil. The sharp rise in prices started Monday was fueled byreports suggesting that OPEC could be closer to limiting production.   Chalabi dismissed as ``baseless'' charges that Iraq wasresponsible for the overall decline in oil prices, saying: ``Iraqiproduction did not change whereas oil prices dropped by 30percent.''   OPEC is producing at least 3.5 million barrels a day more thanits self-imposed collective quota of 15 million barrels. Crude isselling between $14 and $15.50 a barrel on world markets. OPEC'sbenchmark price is $18.   The New York-based Petroleum Intelligence Weekly reported inAugust that Iraq was exporting 500,000 barrels of oil a day to theUnited States.   Chalabi said that talk of a U.S. embargo of Iraqi oil because ofIraq's alleged use of chemical weapons against Turkish refugees didnot worry him.   ``Iraq will be able to find markets for selling its oil, andconsequently our oil exports will not be affected by any embargo,''Chalabi said.</TEXT></DOC>
