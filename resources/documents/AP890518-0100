More than 10,000 licensed pilots have drunken driving records,but officials said they had not determined how many might beaffected. The FAA last month announced it was cracking down on morethan 1,000 pilots who had failed to report drunken driving actions.   Under a proposed rule published in today's Federal Register, theFAA could deny an application or suspend a pilot's certificate ifthe individual's license is revoked or suspended for an offenseinvolving alcohol or drugs twice within three years.   The rule-making follows concerns raised by the NationalTransportation Safety Board over pilots who were allowed to flyeven though their automobile driver's licenses were suspended fordrunken driving. The board has raised similar concerns over shipcaptains and others not under FAA jurisdiction.   The FAA rule would require that pilots report any alcohol- ordrug-related convictions or administrative action that occurredwithin a three-year period before the rule takes effect. Failure toreport subsequent actions within 60 days after they occur would begrounds for losing a pilot's license.   The rule would become final later this year if it passes apublic comment period and further analysis by FAA lawyers, saidagency spokeswoman JoAnn Sloane.   In a 1987 comparison of FAA medical records with the NationalDriver Register, the agency found that driver's licenses of 10,300of the more than 700,000 active pilots had been suspended orrevoked in the preceding seven years for drunken driving.   More than three-fourths of those did not report the convictionsto the FAA when applying for a medical certificate to fly, althoughsuch a report is required, the agency said.   The new rule also would cause a pilot's medical certificate toexpire 61 days after a single drunken driving conviction andrequire reapplication with proof that the pilot was enrolled in analcohol treatment program.   Both a medical certificate and a pilot certificate are requiredto fly.</TEXT></DOC>
