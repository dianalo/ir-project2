A Simple Quiz to Gauge Whether You Earn   Too Little, Just Enough or Too Much   ----   By Gil Schwartz</HL><DATE>04/18/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE R27</SO><LP>   NEWS OF THE $260 MILLION in bonuses paid out by DrexelBurnham as it was spiraling into insolvency has cast thequestion of executive compensation in a new and refreshinglight. In a year when the firm lost $40 million, seniorexecutives carted off envelopes engorged with seven- andeight-figure sums -- all for doing what even dispassionateobservers might call a dramatically terrible job.   That sounds like a pretty good deal to me.</LP><TEXT>   Payment for performance is a noble concept. But to begrossly overpaid regardless of the result? That, my friends,is the American dream]   If you, too, are inspired by this tale, you're probably inthe process of evaluating your compensation package andasking yourself: &quot;How much am I worth? And in spite of that,how can I do better?&quot;   To get a handle on your market value, please fill in thefollowing information as truthfully as possible. Remember --your career path is at stake]                                                                                                          1) It's 7:30 am. You're at your desk, eating a dry muffin.The phone rings. &quot;Can you have the financial impact of theKotzwinkle deal in shape by 11?&quot; asks the controller. You:                                                                                                          a) Say, &quot;Of course, sir&quot; and proceed creatively to crunchnumbers until they appear credible. You format themattractively, take them to the production shop, print andbind them by hand, and deliver them to your boss, who is kindenough to take them to the executive suite.   b) Call in three subordinates, complete the task quickly,and take the completed document over to the controller. Youschmooze for a couple of hours, accepting his thanks andkudos with aplomb.   c) Say, &quot;Sorry, Irv, I've got a full plate through theclose of business.&quot; You then accept his apologies for havingtroubled you on such a busy day, and go to lunch.                                                                                                          2) How many people do you manage?                                                                                                          a) None.
