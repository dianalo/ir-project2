White House aides are said to be elated with the poll results on President Reagan's performance. Whatever the popularity ratings, we hope it isn't impolite to point out that, on the most important issues in U.S.-Soviet relations, the summit in the end was notable more for expectations than results.    More than anything else, this was an arms-control summit. President Reagan insists the summit had a four-part agenda, but discussions on human rights, Afghanistan or Jewish emigration were hard to discern amid all the talk about working toward a nuclear-free world. From the very start, the two sides established two working groups -- one for arms control, and one for everything else. Certainly, it wasn't the human-rights working group that stayed up till all hours trying to strike some &quot;grand compromise.&quot; President Reagan no doubt made the case for human freedom to the Soviets forcefully in private, but the impact can be seen in the final communique's reference to human rights -- 22 antiseptic words.    We wonder, for example, how much solace those words gave the members of the Charter 77 group of human rights in Czechoslovakia. The group, persecuted during the 1970s, resurfaced last week in a letter calling for Soviet and East European compliance with an earlier treaty the U.S. signed with the Soviets, the Helsinki accords. Verification of Helsinki, the letter said, should be treated with no less care than verification of arms-control treaties. The summit, however, produced no on-site inspections for Charter 77.    Expectations also had been high that Mikhail Gorbachev might announce a Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, but in the event &quot;new thinking&quot; offered only old justification. By week's end, Mr. Gorbachev was lapsing back into the propaganda line that the U.S. was to blame for the Soviet presence; if only we'd stop aiding the freedom-fighters, his troops could go home. Mr. Gorbachev also failed to announce any intention to stop providing military aid to Nicaragua, Vietnam, Ethiopia or the many other victories for the Brezhnev Doctrine that make life miserable for the U.S.S.R.'s neighbors as well as its own citizens.    Still, President Reagan said Friday that &quot;the people of both countries won&quot; at the summit, and he clearly meant arms control. The INF Treaty signing may have been the showcase, but &quot;progress&quot; was also reported on reducing strategic nuclear arms. We doubt a prudent START agreement can be struck any time soon, but Mr. Reagan seems intent on pursuing a treaty he can sign in Moscow.    In doing so, we hope the President will keep foremost in mind his commitment to SDI, or strategic defense. The Soviets now claim not to oppose SDI, but only to want the U.S. to adhere to the ABM Treaty. They can afford such generosity because they know Congress wants to commit the Reagan administration to a narrow ABM interpretation that will cripple SDI testing. At the summit, the Soviets wouldn't agree to wording that included space testing for SDI, but they did agree to finesse the issue of treaty interpretation. So Mr. Reagan can still keep SDI, but only if he's willing to fight for it. He has refused to let SDI become a bargaining chip with the Soviets, but SDI will still fail if he continues to use it as a bargaining chip with Congress.    Mr. Reagan's finest hour in summitry was at Reykjavik last year, when he walked away from a START agreement -- and a Nobel Prize -- rather than give up SDI. He can renew that triumph if he remembers that SDI remains more important to American security than any START agreement Mr. Gorbachev is likely to give him. </TEXT></DOC>
