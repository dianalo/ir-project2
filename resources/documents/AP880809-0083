SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Weather experts usually are loathe to sayanything nice about hurricanes, but some are conceding that the bigtropical storms could be something of a blessing during the drought.   People who don't live along the Atlantic or Gulf coasts shouldbe hoping for hurricanes, Douglas LeComte, editor of theAgriculture Department's Weekly Weather and Crop Bulletin, saidTuesday.   ``I think most people are really hoping for a benign hurricaneto move up the Mississippi Valley and really drench the TennesseeValley,'' LeComte said.   ``What we really want is to get a hurricane and take the windaway and take the tornadoes away but keep the rain,'' said RichardHeim, a meteorologist at the National Climatic Data Center inAsheville, N.C.   ``Of course, if you get one you get the other,'' Heim observed,so if ``we get a nice hurricane to put a dent in the drought, itcan also put a dent in a lot of people's property.''   Hurricanes, nature's most powerful storms, develop over warmtropical waters and churn into huge systems with winds as high as100 mph or more. The hurricane season starts in June but the stormstend to be most active in August and September.   Right now, tropical storm Beryl is churning up the Gulf ofMexico near New Orleans.   Historically, hurricanes have caused massive destruction ofoceanfront properties. Weather experts say the winds and surge ofsea water driven ahead of the storms are especially dangerous. Oncethey move inland, hurricanes lose the energy derived from the oceanand break up, sometimes producing powerful thunderstorms.   These storms often provide 5 inches of rain or more, and canproduce a major share of the annual moisture in some areas.   In 1980, for example, a serious drought in Texas was broken bythe combined rains of Hurricane Allen and Tropical Storm Danielle.   Yet hurricanes also can produce so much moisture that droughtsmay be replaced by equally disastrous flooding.   Alvin, Texas, was swamped by 43 inches of rain in 24 hours onJuly 24-25, 1979. In two days in September 1950, Yankeetown, Fla.,was drenched by 38.7 inches of rain.   This year, as drought continues to plague much of the nation,the onset of hurricane season _ even if the storms prove as benignas LeComte would hope _ probably would benefit only limited areas.   ``What we would like it to do, to help end the drought, is (fora storm) to move into the Georgia and Tennessee and North Carolinaand Kentucky areas and sit here for two or three days. That's theoptimum thing,'' Heim said.   Axel Graumann of the Asheville data center said hurricanesusually move along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts and bring morerelief to the Southeast than most other areas. Others tend to movenorthward as far as New England and Canada.   It is possible for remnants of Gulf Coast hurricanes to move asfar inland as Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, ``but that is very,very unlikely,'' Heim said. It is very rare for rain clouds from ahurricane to become caught up in a cold front and move even fartherinland.   ``About the only way to quickly make up the 10 to 15 inches ofrain needed in the Tennessee Valley would be a hurricane, but Idon't think anybody wants it all at once,'' LeComte said.</TEXT></DOC>
