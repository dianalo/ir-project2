Although thisdefinition seems straightforward, it was apparent at a recent workshopon evolutionary theory and molecular biology that it was not one thatcould be accepted by all. In particular, the fact that the definitiondoes not include a cause, eg, natural selection, was quite distressingto some. In itself, this points up one of the principal issues that willmark any discussion in which we are asked to explain how any one distinctivecharacteristic evolved, be it a pattern of behavior, a morphologic feature,an amino acid sequence, or a run of nucleotides. Time and again, theissue will be: Did it evolve by Darwinian natural selection or was it,wholly or in part, the work of some other mechanism? In what follows,the intent is to consider this issue as it bears on discoveries emanatingfrom the capacity to examine the products of genes, and now genes themselves,at a molecular level. The focus will be first on what the author believesare some of the principles or lessons to be learned form these endeavorsand second on what he sees as the central questions emerging in the courseof such endeavors. By way of a warning, he has called this minimalistsketch an outsider's view, not just as a disclaimer but to emphasizethat any view of evolution will necessarily be an outsider's, since avalid evolutionary synthesis must encompass disciplines as diverse asmathematical population genetics and paleobiology and all the other biologies;behavioral, developmental, cell, and molecular.</TEXT></DOC>
