Massey to manage its London-based European operations, causing the departure of the previous boss, Miles A. Slater.    The appointment, a significant upgrading of the post, reflects increasing efforts by Salomon and U.S. securities houses generally to tighten controls on their operations here and improve profitability.    The shake-up also marks the latest executive upheaval at the Wall Street securities house. In the past few months, several senior Salomon officials have quit in internal power struggles and disputes over management direction.    Mr. Slater, who has been with Salomon in London for the past 18 months, quit after Salomon offered him other executive positions in the U.S. that apparently were lower in independence and status. The departure of Mr. Slater, a gruff New Yorker whose style apparently alienated many Salomon veterans in London, had been rumored since the Salomon turmoil began.    In a telephone interview yesterday, Salomon Brothers President Thomas W. Strauss said Mr. Massey's appointment as president and chief executive officer of the Salomon Brothers International unit &quot;underscores how (importantly) we view London and Europe&quot; in the coming years. He said the 45-year-old Mr. Massey is one of Salomon's top seven executives and will retain his position as vice chairman and a member of the office of Salomon Chairman John Gutfreund.    Mr. Strauss said Mr. Massey will report to him, as Mr. Slater did. But Salomon officials said they expect Mr. Massey to exert greater personal influence over the direction of the London operations. Mr. Massey, a 21-year Salomon veteran, rose through the firm's sales operation. An executive vice president of Salomon Inc., the securities firm's parent, he previously was responsible for marketing and information technology.    Mr. Massey wasn't available for comment yesterday.    Asked if he was pushed out, Mr. Slater replied: &quot;not in a clinical sense.&quot; He added: &quot;There comes a time when you look at yourself and the world and say, 'I want to take a fresh look.'&quot; He said he hadn't decided yet whether to remain in the securities business, though he likely will return to the U.S. He described his departure as amicable; the resignation was effective yesterday. He will remain with the firm here until July 1 to assist the transition.    Mr. Strauss said the decision to post Mr. Massey to London preceded Mr. Slater's decision to resign. He said the move doesn't reflect any unhappiness with Mr. Slater's performance since he came to London. &quot;Business here has been very good, and we are pleased,&quot; he said.    He declined to say whether the London operation currently is profitable, but other Salomon officials have said costs outstripped revenue during parts of last year.    Mr. Strauss said Mr. Massey's move will beef up London management. &quot;This transition has been dictated by the importance of this office for Salomon.&quot; Charles S. McVeigh will remain chairman of the London unit, a largely non-executive role.    Mr. Slater came to London as head of Salomon's non-U.S. securities trading operations just prior to October 1986's Big Bang deregulation of the London financial markets. He was appointed president and chief executive of the London unit last April. </TEXT></DOC>
