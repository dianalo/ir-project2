At 2 p.m. on Nov. 4, Mr. Burrington was shrugging off hisjacket at the Mirror Group Newspapers' executive dining roomwhen he was summoned to the phone. It was Mr. Maxwell,calling via satellite from his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine,anchored at harbor in the Canary Islands.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;He apologized for disturbing me, which wasn't like him,&quot;recalls Mr. Burrington, Mirror Group's deputy chairman. ThenMr. Maxwell asked: &quot;Anything happening?&quot;   Minor corporate skirmishes, Mr. Burrington told him, whichcould wait until Mr. Maxwell got back. But he seized thechance to remind his boss of a pledge he had made to meetwith Mr. Burrington immediately upon his return. Mr. Maxwellknew he would then have to answer questions from an anxiousMirror Group board about the mysterious transfer of #47million in Mirror funds to U.S. banks and to a privateMaxwell company. &quot;We must talk,&quot; Mr. Burrington told him onthe phone.   Mr. Maxwell had promised to face board members on Nov. 1,before abruptly pleading illness and flying instead toGibraltar for a sail on the Lady Ghislaine. In the phone chaton Nov. 4, he told Mr. Burrington he would be back the nextday, and they would meet soon.   Fifteen or so hours later, 68-year-old Mr. Maxwell tumbledoff his yacht into the Atlantic. The official autopsyverdict, citing both heart trouble and drowning ascontributing factors, is inconclusive.   What is clear is that Mr. Maxwell had the answers hisboard was seeking. But to reveal them meant ruin.   A reconstruction of the last months of Mr. Maxwell's lifeshows a desperate, and ultimately futile, strategy to save aship sinking in a sea of debt. The press baron's ploy wasvintage Maxwell. By shuffling an estimated $1.3 billionbetween the public and private parts of his empire, &quot;Cap'nBob&quot; hoped to hide his financial straits while propping upthe share price of Maxwell Communication Corp. (MCC), hisflagship public company. It was the value of these shares --collateral for both public and private debt -- thatunderpinned banks' continued support for his borrowings.   By the night of Nov. 4, however, Mr. Maxwell knew hisscheme was on the rocks. There had been indications thatBritish regulators were snooping around his empire. Hisconversation with Mr. Burrington implied that the MirrorGroup board also was ready to unmask Mr. Maxwell's illegalmoney shuffling.   A later phone call, from his son Kevin, would deliver afurther blow: Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. had broken ranks withother lenders and unloaded more than two million MaxwellCommunication shares to recoup a portion of its Maxwellloans. The sale, on Oct. 31, would be announced on Nov. 5,likely setting off a panic among MCC holders.   Mr. Burrington believes that the prospect of returning toLondon, &quot;humiliated and exposed as a wrongdoer,&quot; may havebeen more than Mr. Maxwell could bear. &quot;Robert Maxwell was abrave man,&quot; he says, but &quot;I think he killed himself.&quot;   The Goldman Sachs share sale was announced just hoursbefore MCC revealed to a startled financial world that Mr.Maxwell was missing at sea. By then, its shares wereplunging, in a free fall from which they have neverrecovered.   The Ides of March                                                                                                          On the surface, March 1991 was a month of triumph forRobert Maxwell. Docking the 190-foot Lady Ghislaine at NewYork's Water Club, Mr. Maxwell, who preferred to sleep at theHelmsley Palace, entered negotiations to rescue the ailing,strife-ridden Daily News. Eventually, he charmed and bulliedunion leaders into cutting 800 jobs. It seemed a repeat ofthe magic he'd worked when he bought the union-encrustedLondon Daily Mirror in 1984 and proved it was still possibleto publish a profitable paper on Fleet Street.   In retrospect, the Daily News takeover was acharacteristic act of gluttony. In a race to keep up with hisarchrival, Rupert Murdoch, Mr. Maxwell couldn't resistingesting another paper -- even as debt already was burstingthe seams of his empire. &quot;His ego was bigger than SaddamHussein's,&quot; says Roy Greenslade, a former Daily Mirrorexecutive editor fired in a clash of wills with Mr. Maxwelllast year.   And it was in the same expansionist spirit as Mr.Maxwell's acquisition three years earlier of publisherMacmillan Inc. and Official Airline Guides. During thisbuying spree, he not only regularly paid too much; all of thepurchases saddled his empire with $3.35 billion in additionaldebt. Atop that came recession. By the time he became saviorof the Daily News, sirens already were wailing in London.   But the alarm wasn't widely heard; in retrospect, it wasonly Mr. Maxwell's talent for bullying critics into silencethat allowed him to hang on as long as he did. On Oct. 4,1990, Brian Sturgess, a media analyst with London brokersBarclays de Zoete Wedd, sent a notice to clients titled &quot;Debtat the Captain's Table.&quot; It said Mr. Maxwell was doing &quot;aseries of juggling acts between MCC and {his} privatevehicles&quot; to raise cash to meet short-term debt. It calledMCC's overall strategy &quot;totally off course&quot; and recommended a&quot;cautious stance&quot; by investors.   Mr. Sturgess says his essential message was that Mr.Maxwell could keep up with his debts only by &quot;robbing Peterto pay Paul.&quot;   Mr. Maxwell threatened to sue, then contacted officials atBarclays Bank, the brokerage firm's parent and a majorMaxwell lender. The upshot: The firm's research departmenttook another look at MCC and told Mr. Sturgess that &quot;they sawthe company's point of view&quot; about the objections to hisreport, he says. Over Mr. Sturgess's objections, it printedthree corrections of his report, the last of which apologizedfor his judgment that asset sales would &quot;weaken the group'searning prospects.&quot;   A month later, Mr. Sturgess was fired. &quot;They didn't giveany reason, but they did say the Maxwell thing hadn'thelped,&quot; says the analyst, who now runs his own economicconsultancy. A Barclays de Zoete Wedd spokesman says thefiring had &quot;no connection&quot; to the incident; he also pointsout that a later revised report, while lacking the sting ofMr. Sturgess's, retained its sell recommendation.   In fact, Mr. Sturgess's report was prescient.Investigators now believe that it was soon after taking overthe Daily News that Mr. Maxwell began intensively raiding thetreasuries of his public companies to keep his creditors atbay. In other words, robbing Peter to pay Paul.                                                                                                          A Troubled Spring                                                                                                          In late March and April this year, Mr. Maxwell began amore public scramble for cash. First, he announced the saleof Pergamon Press, a cash generator and the foundation onwhich he first built his fortune in the 1950s. Then heannounced he would sell 49% of Mirror to the public.   While some analysts saw these moves as a sign ofdesperation, Mr. Maxwell was his usual ebullient self. Heboasted before the share float that Mirror Group was so solidand its shares so fairly priced that even &quot;a one-eyedAlbanian&quot; could see the virtue of investing. He also impliedthat the float, coupled with the Pergamon sale, would put hisempire back on an even keel. &quot;You will notice that Mr.Maxwell has not been having any meetings with his bankers,&quot;he said. &quot;My next meeting will be in October 1992.&quot;   This was technically true of his public-company debts.What the public couldn't see was the growing debt in hisconvoluted, and largely hidden, private empire, which wascontrolled by family trusts in Liechtenstein, famed forbanking privacy.   Mr. Maxwell also was blunt about retaining majorityownership of Mirror Group: &quot;I will not, so long as I amalive, be in a public company in which I or my family haveless than 51%.&quot; Control also meant controlling the finances-- pension fund included.   Between April and November, more than $1 billion wouldflow from various Maxwell public-company accounts. At leastsome of it, in April and in July, went to a share-buyingscheme whose sole aim was boosting the price of MaxwellCommunication stock, investigators for Britain's SeriousFraud Office now believe.   Exactly how it worked, and who the players were, has onlypartly been revealed. One clue is in an affidavit read in aLondon court Monday. It says a Maxwell executive, SheldonAboff, got a #3.1 million loan from a private Maxwellcompany, which he used to buy 422,000 shares of the publiccompanies, MCC and MGN (Mirror Group Newspapers).   In April, no such details had emerged. But as MCC sharesreached a two-year peak of 239 pence in mid-April, London'sFinancial Times noted: &quot;In the past few weeks, they haveproduced a remarkable and slightly mysterious recovery.&quot;   On another front, Giles Orton, a solicitor, had agreed totake on a risky job: representing Mirror Group pensionersalready concerned about possible manipulations in the MirrorGroup fund. At its last audit, the fund had been running a#150 million surplus. But raises to pensioners had beenstingy, and more and more of the pension fund was beinghanded over to a Maxwell private company to administer.   Mr. Orton says his initial tack was to &quot;raise properquestions&quot; in a letter to the pension fund trustees, chairedby Mr. Maxwell. He got back a letter telling him that theclaims were unfounded. Mr. Orton kept pressing, but notwithout the same trepidation that journalists and financialanalysts felt each time they got near Mr. Maxwell. When TomBower, a free-lance author, wrote a critical biography of himin 1988, Mr. Maxwell filed 11 separate lawsuits to stoppublication; when that failed, he succeeded in intimidatingmany booksellers -- usually by threatening lawsuits -- intokeeping the book off their shelves.   Later, Mr. Bower turned to magazines and was commissionedfive times to write articles by the British press in 1990 and1991; he collected &quot;kill fees&quot; on all five when publishers,in the end, pleaded fear of lawsuits and spiked the stories.   &quot;You didn't need Maxwell to threaten you,&quot; says Mr. Orton;his reputation as the most litigious man in Britain meantthat &quot;he no longer even needed to make threats.&quot; In the end,the pensioners' appeal fell on deaf ears.                                                                                                          Summer Storms                                                                                                          Whatever private palliatives Mr. Maxwell was applying toMCC's share price, they couldn't halt a slow, steady slide inMay and June. In fact, it was only the unseen hand of theshare-support scheme that kept the stock from falling out ofbed, according to both investigators and analysts who followthe company.   Not only was the share price important to Mr. Maxwellbecause it underpinned his loans, but also because itjustified the dividend -- and Mr. Maxwell himself, throughhis various holdings, controlled fully 68% of the dividends.That was a nice chunk of change that could help keep hismushrooming private debt at bay.   The release, on June 14, of MCC's March 1991 year-endearnings showed just how shaky the empire had become. It wasa typical Maxwell earnings report: so convoluted it causedlittle immediate stir. But analysts wading through thethicket found ample cause for alarm. Some #80.7 million, ormore than half of pretax profit, came from currency trading,and much of the rest was from one-time sales of stocks, bondsand real estate. Publishing generated a paltry #12.6 millionprofit.   Quintin Price, a media analyst at James Capel andamp; Co., hadendured a battering from Mr. Maxwell a year before when heurged a &quot;cautious stance&quot; toward MCC after seeing itsyear-end figures. Nonetheless, this time he gave MCC sharesthe firm's lowest rating, a C4, which Mr. Price translates as&quot;get me out.&quot;   The scary thing for John Kenny, an analyst at Barclays deZoete Wedd, was the amount MCC had to risk for the currencyprofits. &quot;It sounds to me like they could have been punting{wagering} the best part of one billion pounds to achievethat profit,&quot; he says. It wasn't lost on him and others thatthose who make fortunes on foreign-exchange trading have beenknown to lose fortunes as well.   This would happen soon enough. During the summer, Mr.Maxwell began betting, and losing, ever larger sums on the&quot;forex&quot; market. This trading was itself financed by newshort-term debt, deepening the hole Mr. Maxwell had alreadydug. Investigators now know that he also was dipping everlarger amounts out of the Mirror Group's pension till andother accounts.   Peter Checketts, financial editor of European MediaBusiness andamp; Finance, thinks the currency trading was &quot;a signof a desperate man, a man on a sticky wicket who realizedtime was running out.&quot;   There were other clues. Accountants say Mr. Maxwellconvinced trustees of both the MGN and MCC pension funds thisyear to change the fiscal years of the funds to delay audits.The result: delaying the audit of both funds until early1992, instead of last April.   Mr. Maxwell began shedding ever larger chunks of hisempire, such as an Israeli computer graphics concern and a50.1% stake in MTV Europe. He announced nebulous plans tospin off other U.S. assets in public offerings. He evenstaked his Mirror Group properties at Holborn Circus -- acollection of office buildings that serve as the group'sheadquarters, as well as the headquarters and printing plantfor the Daily Mirror -- as collateral for a #94 million loan.   Eyebrows arched. If Cap'n Bob was mortgaging the seat ofpower, nothing was safe.   But to the public Mr. Maxwell was his usual chameleonself. One day the generous big shot; the next the pettybully; the next, the self-assured wheeler-dealer telling askeptical financial community that his hand was steady at thehelm. Says a broker who dealt with him then: &quot;Maxwell's wholeattitude was: `Bob Maxwell has a plan, even if Bob Maxwell isthe only person who understands what the plan is.' Trustme.'&quot;   And in New York in July, Mr. Maxwell was still being fetedas the Savior of the Daily News. He named himself publisherand hinted that New York might become the new focus of hisempire. He was elected chairman of the board of New York'sPolytechnic University, the nation's second oldest privatetechnological university, and promised a $10 milliondonation. It would never be delivered.   If the lights were still glittering in New York, the glareof the spotlight was growing hotter in London. The biggeststir was an announcement in July by Peter Walker, a formerTory cabinet minister, that he wouldn't assume the reins ofMCC. The selection of the experienced, orthodox executive hadbeen lauded a short time before as a calming influence forMr. Maxwell's largest public company.   Mr. Walker wouldn't comment, and still won't, on hisdecision to refuse the appointment, but that didn't stopLondon's Independent newspaper from offering an explanation.It said Mr. Walker had initiated his own review of Maxwellaccounts, found them wanting, and decided he wanted nothingto do with the situation.   The Independent articles, which included an analysis ofMr. Maxwell's finances, ran on July 16 and 17. On the 18th,Mr. Maxwell's solicitors filed a libel writ -- their fifthaction against the paper in three years -- and won aninjunction to prevent the paper, or others, from reprintingthe allegations concerning Mr. Walker. Mr. Maxwell had onceagain managed to gag his critics.   The Fall                                                                                                          In September, Mr. Maxwell's Cockney chauffeur observed achange in his boss's behavior. Normally, John Featley says,the preoccupied press baron &quot;was the sort who'd walk past youwithout noticing you were there.&quot; But in the last two monthsof his life, he became more open and chatty. &quot;He'd say goodmorning to you, instead of the other way around,&quot; says Mr.Featley, who had been driving Mr. Maxwell's Silver SpurRolls-Royce for three years. &quot;He was over the moon. That'swhen I started thinking, `Something's not quite right.'&quot;   Those who knew him see two possible explanations for Mr.Maxwell's giddiness: He still thought he could worm his wayout of what was by now a colossal jam; or he had reconciledhimself to defeat and recognized he would soon be dethronedas a corporate monarch. Maybe he thought he'd need a fewfriends on the way down.   One of the things that had gone terribly wrong was thatMr. Maxwell had finally run out of money. Even the hundredsof millions he was pulling out of MGN and MCC were no longerenough to cover his debts. Until now, shifting money about --combined with cajolery -- had kept bankers at bay. In fact,while much now is made of the gullibility of banks lendingMr. Maxwell billions, the truth is that Mr. Maxwell, howevermercurial his 20-year rise had been, had always paid hisbanks.   But now, lenders were near revolt. Some, like GoldmanSachs, which held a large block of MCC shares as collateral,had begun dumping them. Such selling, by mid-October, sankthe shares to 157 pence, down 82 pence from their April high.   This forced Mr. Maxwell into even more desperate buying ofhis own shares, which he had to fund with yet more loans. &quot;Hegot into a vicious circle,&quot; says Christopher Napier, alecturer in accounting at the London School of Economics.&quot;Because so many of the private loans were secured withpublic shares, he had to keep up the value of the shares atany cost. He was really chasing his own tail.&quot;   The most nettlesome creditor was Swiss Bank Corp., whichwas hounding a Maxwell private company, known as Adviser 188,for securities that Adviser had promised as collateral for a#55 million loan in August. Throughout September and October,there had been a rash of meetings. Exasperated, the bankfinally declared it would have its securities or declare theloan in default. On Oct. 30, Mr. Maxwell's representativessaid his company would instead prepay the loan in full. Theagreed-upon prepayment date was Nov. 5 -- the day Mr. Maxwelldied.   Those familiar with the loan say it also reveals howarcane, and devious, the Maxwell empire had become. The loanwas to be used by Adviser to purchase all the shares of FirstTokyo Investment Trust, a Scottish concern that invested inJapanese stocks.   Another Maxwell private concern had held a minority stakein the trust since 1988. In 1990, First Tokyo's investmentstrategy wasn't working, and the trust hoped to improve itsfortunes by engaging in securities lending -- the temporarylending of stock from a portfolio for a fee.   What directors of the trust discovered, however, is thatits Maxwell partners, though they had no right to do so, hadalready pledged the First Tokyo portfolio as collateral tosecure private Maxwell loans, those familiar with the casesay. In the tumult that ensued, Mr. Maxwell, to quiet thetrustees, agreed to buy all of the First Tokyo portfolio hedidn't already own.   Under his loan agreement with Swiss Bank, Mr. Maxwell wasto promptly turn over the entire First Tokyo portfolio ascollateral. Astonishingly, despite all the assurances toSwiss Bank during the fall meetings, Mr. Maxwell no longereven owned the shares. He had already sold most of them inAugust, according to documents provided by Swiss Bank.   It would be that revelation, two days after Mr. Maxwell'sdeath, that would send Britain's Serious Fraud Officescurrying over to Maxwell's Holborn headquarters fordocuments.   In October, Mr. Maxwell also was under siege from his ownexecutives. On Oct. 15, Lawrence Guest, the Mirror Group'sfinancial director, first confronted Mr. Maxwell about the#47 million in Mirror Group accounts. Mr. Maxwell hemmed andhawed but found himself collared by Mr. Guest and Mr.Burrington six days later. He flatly told Mr. Guest that hisfears were unfounded -- an outright lie. The meeting set thestage for a showdown with the Mirror board, the one scheduledfor Mr. Maxwell's return from the Canary Islands.   Throughout the fall, as Mr. Maxwell staved off creditorsand colleagues, he also endured his worst public poundingsince 1971, when British regulators had declared he wasn'tfit to run a public company. On Sept. 23, BritishBroadcasting Corp. aired a 40-minute special on Mr. Maxwell'smounting debts, his dubious accounting, his attempts to propup MCC shares and his rigging of lottery games at the Mirror.It also discussed &quot;the Max Factor,&quot; shorth -- and for thetheory that shares in Maxwell companies traded lower thanthey might if someone else were in charge.   While most of the material was known to analysts, it hadnever received such a broad -- and bald -- public airing. Mr.Maxwell's characteristic flurry of libel writs, issued hoursafter the show, couldn't undo the damage.   Also in September, The Wall Street Journal ran afront-page article headlined &quot;Bloated Empire&quot; that suggestedMr. Maxwell's tangle of debts would force him to sell many ofhis remaining assets, at a fraction of what he'd paid forthem.   Then, on Oct. 20, came publication of Seymour Hersh's book&quot;The Samson Option,&quot; about Israel's nuclear weapons program.It included allegations that Mr. Maxwell had links to theIsraeli intelligence agency Mossad, allegations promptlydiscussed in the House of Commons. Mr. Maxwell issued writs,of course, and unsuccessfully sought an injunction to stopdistribution of the book.                                                                                                          The End Game                                                                                                          Mr. Maxwell began the last week of his life as he had somany others, shuttling between his Holborn office and banksin the City of London. Mr. Featley, his driver, says the lastride he gave Mr. Maxwell was on Oct. 29, to visit the headoffices of National Westminster Bank, his largest creditor.&quot;I thought, here we're at it again: Poof -- he's going topull another one out of the hat,&quot; Mr. Featley recalls.   Mr. Maxwell's son Kevin was along in the Rolls those lastfew days, speaking with his father in French, &quot;which theyalways did when talking about finance,&quot; says Mr. Featley, whoassumes they did so for confidentiality. Mr. Maxwell alsoseemed subdued in his use of his cellular phone. &quot;He wasn'tcalling George {Bush} and Boris {Yeltsin} and other worldleaders as much as he usually did,&quot; he says.   On the 30th, Mr. Maxwell didn't leave Holborn and slept inthe luxury penthouse above his offices there. Mr. Featleysays he was lingering in the hall at 8:45 that night when Mr.Maxwell spotted him, slung an arm over his shoulder --something he'd done only once in three years -- and asked himto be on call because he might &quot;go some place early in themorning.&quot; When Mr. Featley arrived at work on the 31st, helearned that Mr. Maxwell had flown by helicopter from hisHolborn heliport at 6:30 a.m. to London Airport, and fromthere by private jet to Gibraltar.   Such last-minute travels weren't unusual, nor did thedestination surprise Mr. Featley. &quot;He had a bad cold that hecouldn't shake,&quot; he says. &quot;Rumor Central had it that hisdoctors in New York had told him to take some rest, maybeeven check into a hospital.&quot;   Mr. Maxwell chose instead a sail on the Lady Ghislaine. Onprevious cruises, he'd usually taken a working holiday on theyacht, with a butler and secretary in tow, phoning and faxingto every outpost of his empire. This time, he took no one butthe boat's 11-man crew. &quot;It was very unusual,&quot; says Mr.Burrington. &quot;He wanted an entourage and an audience. Therewas no pleasure in him being alone.&quot;   In Gibraltar, Mr. Maxwell rode from his plane to the boatin a white Mercedes, with only two briefcases and a smallhandbag as luggage. The yacht spent several days cruisingfrom Gibraltar to the Canaries, with a stop at Madeira. Whilethere, Mr. Maxwell played tourist and, according to Britishpress reports, gambled at the Portuguese island's casino. Healso spoke on the phone to Jean Baddeley, a longtimeconfidant and now marketing development director at MirrorGroup. &quot;He sounded in good spirits, and said he was feelingbetter and the sun was shining,&quot; she recalls.   On the morning of Nov. 4, the Lady Ghislaine arrived atSanta Cruz on the Canary island of Tenerife. Mr. Maxwell swamin the morning. In the afternoon he had his fatefulconversations with Mr. Burrington, about meeting with theboard to discuss missing funds, and with his son Kevin, aboutthe Goldman Sachs sale. Even then, crew members say, hedisplayed no overt signs of distress. The boat's captain, GusRankin, was struck by Mr. Maxwell's uncharacteristicallylaidback demeanor throughout the cruise. &quot;It was quite a calmtrip,&quot; he says, with fewer phone calls and business dealingsthan normal for the workaholic tycoon.   Mr. Maxwell had been scheduled to speak that night inLondon at an annual $135-a-head dinner at the Anglo-IsraelAssociation. Ruth Saunders, an association official, says thegroup didn't learn he would be absent until 7:15, just 15minutes before the event was to begin. It was then that Mr.Maxwell's wife and his son Ian arrived and explained that Ianwould deliver his father's prepared speech. Ms. Saundersdescribes it as a &quot;very frank and very un-English&quot; talk inits blunt call for strong support of Israel, and criticism ofSyria. She adds that there was nothing in the behavior ofeither mother or son to suggest anything was amiss.   As Ian spoke, Mr. Maxwell dined alone at the Hotel Mencey,Santa Cruz's best restaurant. He was the only person eatingthere at the time. According to the maitre d'hotel, SergioRodriguez, he had a mixed salad and hake with mushroom andclam sauce, with a pear for dessert. He drank two beers, andordered a third but didn't drink it. He smoked a cigar buthad no coffee.   He paid the 5,200-peseta bill (about $52) in cash, with an800-peseta tip. When he got up to leave at about 9:30, heleft his jacket on the chair. Mr. Rodriguez pointed this outto him and Mr. Maxwell went back to get it. Other than thissomewhat distracted moment, Mr. Rodriguez says Mr. Maxwellappeared normal, if slightly out of breath, &quot;but only as muchas any person who weighed 300 pounds.&quot; Workers at the hoteltook no particular notice of Mr. Maxwell, having no idea whohe was.   Mr. Maxwell returned by taxi to the yacht, which set sailfor the night with the intent of returning to land the nextday for Mr. Maxwell's return flight to London. He madeseveral calls, including one to a London rabbi, reportedly todiscuss recovering Jewish archives in Moscow. At 11 p.m., hespoke with Ian, who later told the British press his fatherseemed in good spirits. He said he had reminded his father ofthe busy schedule he faced on his return.   According to investigators' reports, Mr. Maxwell was lastseen strolling on deck at about 4:20 a.m. Complaining aboutthe heat, he asked that the air conditioning in his cabin beturned on. Then, at 4:45, he called from there and asked thatit be shut off. Sometime in the next three hours, accordingto the coroner, he disappeared overboard.   Gauging Mr. Maxwell's state of mind in his final hours hasbecome something of a party game in Britain. Friends andcolleagues have floated every conceivable theory about hisdemise. Some have speculated that he cleverly engineered hisown death to collect insurance, or even faked his death andescaped with billions to South America. Capt. Rankin, forone, scoffs at such speculation. &quot;The guy couldn't evenremember his own phone number, for Christ's sake,&quot; he says.   Ms. Baddeley is another who thinks the suicide theoriesare bunk. As his secretary and later as his office director,she worked with him &quot;20 hours a day for 25 years,&quot; she says.&quot;He was my best friend.&quot; At no time, she says, did he everbrood, or run from his considerable problems.   &quot;He was a great positive thinker,&quot; she says. &quot;He didn'thave the words `impossible' or `can't' in his vocabulary.&quot;She imagines his mind working the same way, right up to theend. &quot;His thought would have been, `There must be a way toget out of this.'&quot;   In fact, escape plans he had laid were still hatching inthe hours after his death. At about 10:30 a.m. on Nov. 5,Robert Pirie of Rothschild Inc. in New York phoned Mr.Maxwell &quot;on behalf of a client to see if he would sell adivision of Macmillan.&quot; Capt. Rankin took the call and saidMr. Maxwell had asked not to be disturbed.   It was a later call, at 11 a.m., that caused the crew tofinally check Mr. Maxwell's cabin. Finding it empty, theyreported him missing. After an air and sea search, ahelicopter winched Mr. Maxwell's unclothed body from theAtlantic at 6:45 p.m. The precise cause of death remainselusive. The Spanish coroner found Mr. Maxwell's arteries upto 70% clogged, which could have caused a heart attack(although a pathologist hired by Mr. Maxwell's insurers issaid to have found no evidence of a heart attack). Drowningwasn't ruled out.   Mr. Maxwell's last will and testament also is shrouded indoubt. The will is in the hands of insolvency accountants,who say only that it is several pages long and verycomplicated. They also are searching for additional willsthat may exist in Liechtenstein, Israel and France.   Mr. Maxwell, however, often spoke about his posthumousplans. He was fond of saying that, having grown up destitutehimself, he didn't intend to leave his children a cent. In aninterview with Playboy magazine published just before hisdeath, he said that, instead of money, he hoped to leave themsome larger lessons instead.
