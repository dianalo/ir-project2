The Census Bureau's first ``final'' figures from the 1990census, released Wednesday, showed the pull of the Sun Beltremained strong, despite efforts by the industrial North to promotegrowth and the collapse during the 1980s of the oil and savings andloan industries - two mainstays of the Southern and Western states.   The census figures are used to adjust the number ofrepresentatives each state sends to Congress so that politicalclout is in line with population. The figures also determine thedivision of federal money among states and localities.   The numbers could change next summer when the CommerceDepartment decides whether to adjust the count. Some states andcities are likely to challenge the tallies, whichever way theadjustment decision goes.   ---andequals;   WASHINGTON (AP) - Most Americans have not planned for criticalmedical decisions they some day may have no control over, but NancyCruzan's ``right-to-die'' struggle made them more aware of theiroptions, experts say.

Weber said his New York-based organization has filled 800,000requests for sample living wills and similar documents since theSupreme Court's decision in the Cruzan case last June.   ``The volume from all over the country, which we trackeddirectly from the Cruzan case, was incredible. We had to start anight shift,'' he said.   ---andequals;   LYON, France (AP) - For Garry Kasparov, it was the world chesstitle and something more.
