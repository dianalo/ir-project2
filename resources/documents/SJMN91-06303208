Kocher also said water customers needed to be rewarded forexcellent conservation practices during rationing the previous summer.;    Thedecision made some people uneasy; more than a few angry calls came intoKocher's office.;    On Monday, however, an examination of summer statisticsshowed Santa Cruz residents hadn't wasted water when rationing was lifted.Kocher felt vindicated and heaved a sigh of relief.;    Based on totalsthrough Monday and predictions for the final three days of the season, SantaCruz's 22,000 water customers -- 70 percent are households -- will have used atiny bit less than was projected, or 1.949 billion gallons.;    The numbersmean the department's prediction, based on a dicey combination of historicaldata, river patterns and climatological guesswork, proved amazingly close,only 5 million gallons off, or about half of one day's usage.;    &quot;How aboutthat!&quot; exclaimed Kocher, beaming as he finished adding a column of numbers.&quot;That's pretty damn close.&quot;;    &quot;Spooky,&quot; said water conservation coordinatorAnn-Marie Mitroff.;    Both cautioned that the drought is not over. Steadywinter rains are desperately needed to bring the city water picture back tonormal. But because residents maintained a 20 percent cut this summer, SantaCruz's water supply clearly is not in the dire shape some had predictedearlier this year.;    Santa Cruz's only reservoir, Loch Lomond, is 45 percentfull, the same as at the end of last summer and 11 feet higher than at thesame time in 1988. If this winter brings rainfall slightly above average, forexample 55 inches, Loch Lomond likely will return to before-drought levels ofabout 70 percent full, Kocher said.;    That would mean the reservoir could bereopened to anglers next year for the first time in four years, he said. Also,decent winter rains would certainly negate summer rationing for next year.;   Showers on Saturday and Sunday dumped 2.5 inches of rain over Santa Cruz'swatershed. But almost all of it soaked into the parched ground. It will taketwo or three more steady rainfalls before a sizable amount runs off and beginsrefilling Loch Lomond, Kocher said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PAUL ROGERS, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Santa Cruz/Monterey  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911029  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  447  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, October 29, 199100303208,SJ1  </DATELINE><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
