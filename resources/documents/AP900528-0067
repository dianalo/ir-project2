The patient died.   ``The sheets just caught on fire. It's bizarre,'' said FireDepartment spokesman Pat Marek.   Investigators were seeking the cause of the fire at thesprawling UCLA Medical Center on the campus of the University ofCalifornia, Los Angeles, Marek said.   An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death of thepatient, 26-year-old Angela Hernandez, who had been undergoingsurgery for injuries suffered in an automobile accident, saidcampus spokeswoman Vicki Beck.   It was not immediately known if Ms. Hernandez died because ofthe fire and smoke, her injuries, or a combination of the two.   Eight to 10 medical staff members, including doctors and nurses,were performing the surgery when flames engulfed the surgical clothover the patient, said Ms. Beck.   ``There was a serious attempt by the staff to extinguish thefire,'' she said.   But the smoke became so bad that the operating room staffmembers had to leave the room, and university police arriving atthe scene could not get inside the room, said Ms. Beck.   About five minutes after the fire broke out, city firefightersarrived, but by then the blaze had mostly burned itself out, saidMarek.   ``The fire was just kind of smoldering,'' he said.   The fire was isolated to the operating table and the hospitalhad no structural damage. Nobody else was injured, but the smokeforced the closure of all operating rooms for the day so they couldbe sterilized.   It was the second time in 1{ years a patient died in anoperating room blaze in a southern California hospital.   In October 1988, a 15-day-old boy was fatally burned atCedars-Sinai Medical Center when a spark from an electriccauterizer, used to stop bleeding, started a fire that wasstrengthened by a high concentration of oxygen in the room.   UCLA Medical Center officials declined to say if doctors hadbeen using a cauterizer Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
