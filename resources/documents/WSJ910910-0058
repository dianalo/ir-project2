Employers could remove workers only for &quot;good cause&quot; underan &quot;Employment Termination Act&quot; proposed by the NationalConference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. Thestate-appointed panel recommends arbitration for disputedfirings and says workers who prevail should be entitled toreinstatement with back-pay or severance pay -- but notpunitive damages.</LP><TEXT>   The American Civil Liberties Union's Lewis Maltby praisesthe proposal as potentially &quot;one of the most sweeping piecesof labor law since the National Labor Relations Act.&quot; ButBarry Roseman of the National Employment Lawyers Association,complains that the proposal has lots of loopholes foremployers and would sharply limit workers' rights to seekredress in court.   The commission says that two million private, nonunionemployees are fired annually, of whom up to 200,000 wouldhave legitimate claims using a &quot;good cause&quot; test.                                                                                                          CRITICS CONTEND existing common-law job protections areadequate.   The commission plan would overturn the long-establisheddoctrine that employers can fire &quot;at will.&quot; But courts inmost states already have recognized some grounds forwrongful-firing lawsuits. The panel says the patchworkarrangement complicates management for interstate firms, andit argues that the danger of lawsuits forces employers toadopt costly personnel practices.   Some lawyers argue that without the threat of punitivedamages employers wouldn't be effectively restrained.Attorney Roseman concedes, though, that litigation costs nowkeep many lower-level workers from pursuing claims. TheChamber of Commerce's Peter Eide reserves judgment but saysthe plan may be burdensome to employers in most states,where, he says, the &quot;at-will&quot; principle largely prevails.

Motorola will begin training employees to &quot;pass ontheir knowledge&quot; as advisers; it also offers courses inskills ranging from communication to management to employees,customers and suppliers.   &quot;The education level of a high-school graduate has to bejust as high today to enter the labor market as to go tocollege,&quot; says the National Alliance of Business's GarrisonMoore.
