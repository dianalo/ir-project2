At the annual meeting Friday, holders voted to merge Champion and its subsidiaries into Champion Enterprises Inc., the new holding company. Under the split, holders will receive one share of Champion Enterprises for each five shares of Champion Home Builders.    The pay and record dates for the split were contemporaneous with the effective date of the merger, Saturday.    Champion said shareholders with less than 100 shares will generally receive cash instead of shares of Champion Enterprises.    Champion, which makes manufactured homes, motor homes and medium-duty buses, said reorganization into a holding company will make it easier for management to operate the company's diverse businesses. The spokesman said the reverse split was undertaken to bring the company's stock into a higher price range in an effort to &quot;attract people who are investors, instead of speculators.&quot;    The stock has been trading around $1.50 a share to $2.00 a share for the past few months. Friday, it closed at $1.50 a share, unchanged, in American Stock Exchange composite trading.    As of Friday, before the reverse split, Champion had about 36 million shares outstanding. </TEXT></DOC>
