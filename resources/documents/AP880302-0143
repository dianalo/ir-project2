The Consumer Product Safety Commission said it wants to haltsales of the WORM GETT'R made by Pandamp;M Enterprises of Caldwell, Idaho.   Directory information showed no listing for Pandamp;M Enterprises inCaldwell.   The device uses metal probes on wooden handles and is tiedtogether by an electric wire, the commission said. When the probesare inserted into the ground, electric current passed through thewire drives worms to the surface.   But the commission said the design exposes users to the baremetal charged with electricity and thus could lead to a dangerousshock.   No injuries have been reported involving the device, but therehave been 23 deaths since 1971 involving other brands of similarlydesigned worm probes, the agency reported.   About 30,000 WORM GETT'R devices were sold nationally over thepast five years at prices ranging from $8 to $30, the commissionsaid.   The commission asked that consumers who have been injured, orknow of others who have had mishaps involving any type of wormprobe, to call it at 1-800-638-2772.</TEXT></DOC>
