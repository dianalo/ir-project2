Garcia</HL><DD> 10/28/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   The stock market pulled out of its nosedive once again yesterday, as a rebound in world equity markets and foreign buying of U.S. stocks lifted share prices in an active, but relatively stable session in New York.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 52.56 to 1846.49. The gain yesterday followed a 157-point drop Monday, the second-largest point decline for the average. After its historic plunge of 508 points last Monday, the industrial average had recouped more than half of its losses before sinking near the end of last week.    Although most of the widely followed market indexes posted gains, the advance wasn't overwhelmingly broad. Advancing issues had a small lead over decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, 941 to 821. For the small-capitalization issues traded in the over-the-counter market and on the American Stock Exchange, there was no relief as the selling continued.    The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.52 to 233.19, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 2.63 to 130.51.    Volume fell to 260.2 million shares from 308.8 million in yesterday's shorter trading session. The shorter trading hours will continue through the end of the week.    With a rebound in the stock market, investors' fears about a recession cooled and the bond market slumped. A sharp slide in the U.S. dollar also added some downward pressure to bond prices. Despite the decline in bonds, the Federal Reserve System still continued to make good on its promise to provide ample liquidity through its open market operations.    Traders said investors are still shell-shocked from the turmoil that has engulfed the markets in the past two weeks, so that they are only paying minimal attention to economic news and research reports from Wall Street. The government reported that new orders for nondefense capital goods, usually considered a barometer for future plant and equipment spending, fell 1.3% in September, after a 7.7% decrease in August.    Michael Metz, a market strategist with Oppenheimer andamp; Co. in New York, said that &quot;minimizing risk rather than maximizing returns&quot; have become the new operative terms for investors in the market these days. He sees investors that still want to have a stake in the stock market reaching for blue-chip stocks and trying to get sell positions in secondary issues.    Thomas Bailey, president of Janus Capital Management Corp. in Denver, is certainly living by that philosophy. In a letter to clients, he said the firm is aiming at &quot;capital preservation, lots of cash and bulletproof stocks.&quot; Two weeks ago, as the stock market started to sink after getting disappointing trade-deficit news, Janus Capital began to sell stocks, raising cash in its portfolios to more than 50% from 30%.    Mr. Bailey believes it's important to have lots of cash and hold stocks of companies whose earnings won't be hurt by a slowdown in growth, &quot;because we still don't know what kind of economic picture is going to come out of&quot; this crash.    Wall Street brokerage houses are revamping their lists of recommended issues, putting much emphasis on conservative investments that are likely to fare well even if the economy loses some steam. Standard andamp; Poor's told its clients yesterday to go for utility, food and oil stocks.    Electric and telephone utilities were among some of the stocks that advanced yesterday, along with auto, pharmaceutical, air freight and property-and-casualty insurance issues. Gold, silver, steel, railroad and heavy machinery issues, as well as brokerage stocks lagged yesterday's rebound.    Stock buy-back programs didn't give a boost to all issues. International Business Machines added 6 to 118 in active trading. Big Blue will continue its buy-back plan, spending as much as a total of $1 billion. But NCR finished down 3 1/4 at 53 1/2 after this computer maker said it plans to buy back as much as 10 million shares. Boeing, which made buy-back plans public Monday, fell 1 to 36 1/8.    CBS jumped 8 7/8 to 153 7/8 after the broadcaster said it was discussing with Sony Corp. of America a possible sale of its record operations for $2 billion.    Allegis, the travel conglomerate that is shedding all its units, yesterday said it reached an agreement to sell its Westin Hotel business for $1.35 billion to a group composed of Robert Bass Group and Aoki Corp. of Japan. The group is supported by the Industrial Bank of Japan. Allegis's shares advanced 9 1/2 to 71 on more than 3.3 million shares.    Allegis has agreed to sell its Hertz unit to Ford Motor Co. and a Hertz management group, but it still owns United Airlines.    Rorer Group fell 1 7/8 to 33 1/2, and A.H. Robins dropped 1 1/8 to 16 7/8, amid investor worries that the merger of the two firms might not be completed. Lawyers familiar with the transaction have said this week that the merger appears to be on track. After the market closed, Rorer said its board has decided to follow through on the merger.    The market's turmoil has served losses for the arbitragers who have speculated in many of the rumored takeover targets as the value of their stock holdings plunged. Some pending deals have been squashed.    Bundy Corp. sank 16 1/2 to 20 after the company said TI Group PLC dropped its $40-a-share bid. TI Group cited the current market crisis and the uncertainty of how it might affect the economy. Bundy said it's planning to spend as much as $2.5 million to buy back its shares, but the news hardly slowed the stock's slide.    Another victim was Minstar, whose stock dropped 4 3/4 to 14 in the OTC market. Minstar, controlled by Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs, abandoned its plans to merge with Genmar Industries. Minstar also announced a stock buy-back of as much as five million shares.    Japanese stocks were big gainers, following the rally in the Tokyo stock market. Matshusita Electric Industrial climbed 21 1/2 to 143; Hitachi moved up 12 to 82 1/2; TDK added 4 1/4 to 57 1/2; Sony rose 4 3/8 to 29 1/2; Honda Motor advanced 10 3/4 to 90 3/4; and Kyocera gained 4 5/8 to 63 1/4.    The turmoil in the stock market has made it difficult for companies to raise cash by selling new stock. Several offerings are being pulled. Anchor Glass, whose stock rose 7/8 to 13 3/8, withdrew an issue of three million shares. United Education andamp; Software rose 1/4 to 9 3/4; it's seeking to withdraw a planned public offering of one million shares.    HAL Inc. didn't open for trading yesterday on the American Stock Exchange, after closing at 40 Monday. The parent company for Hawaiian Airlines said its agreement to be acquired at $50 a share, or $95 million, is in jeopardy because its suitor, Hemmeter Corp., has run into difficulties in obtaining financing because of the market plunge. A Hemmeter official said the company was still hopeful that financing could be arranged.    British Petroleum fell 1 to 51 1/2. British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, hopes to reach a decision on whether or not to continue a British Petroleum stock offering by tomorrow. Underwriters have asked that the deal be terminated because of the current unstable market conditions. </TEXT></DOC>
