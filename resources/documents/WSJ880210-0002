The machine, a year late partly because gifted supercomputer designer Steve S. Chen quit the project before it was finished, will make three-dimensional modeling much more sophisticated. Such modeling could lead to designing safer planes and cars and developing exotic new drugs.    Called the Y-MP, the machine is the first Cray to use eight central processors; its largest previous model used four. Multiprocessor machines can break a complicated problem into pieces and send them to separate processors, sharply reducing solution time.    Japanese supercomputer makers have yet to produce a multiprocessor. NEC Corp. and other Japanese makers are believed to be working on four-processor systems, but Cray's latest entry seems likely to make eight processors the industry standard. That gives Minneapolis-based Cray a further leg up in the supercomputer field, which is turning into a battleground between the U.S. and Japan. The Japanese have made supercomputer development a national priority.    With faster speed, more memory and three times the computing capability of the X-MP models it succeeds, the new Cray will perform detailed three-dimensional simulations. Today most computer simulation is two-dimensional, because of the enormous additional computation needed for the third dimension.    Cray already has sold two of the new computers. All told, Cray says it expects to sell four Y-MPs this year and perhaps a dozen next year -- about as many as it can build. The government's Los Alamos National Laboratory confirmed it is buying the first machines to add to what a spokesman described as &quot;the world's most powerful scientific computing network.&quot; The laboratory bought the first Cray in 1976.    The supercomputer's arrival cheered Wall Street. Cray's common stock jumped $3.375 to close at $74.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.    Cray is counting on the new machine to improve its fortunes, which were hurt by the one-year delay. Revenue growth slowed to 15% last year, after exceeding 50% the previous two years, as new users bought smaller Crays and established customers waited for the introduction of the top-of-the-line Y-MP.    The delay also allowed ETA to announce its own eight-processor machine several months ago, beating Cray, which has made building the world's fastest and biggest supercomputers a point of honor. ETA, a unit of Control Data Corp., also grabbed attention by recently introducing two small supercomputers priced at around $1 million, a major price reduction.    But Cray Chairman John A. Rollwagen said the Y-MP's introduction should curb both problems. Though revenue growth is likely to be only 10% to 15% this year, he said, &quot;we're positioned now to enter a new program of growth, starting next year.&quot;    And the new machine should indirectly combat ETA at the low end of the market. Mr. Rollwagen said some Y-MP buyers will trade in their old machines, which might then sell used for as little as $2 million. &quot;This further complicates ETA's life,&quot; said Gary P. Smaby, an analyst with Piper, Jaffray andamp; Hopwood Inc., Minneapolis.    Technologically, the Y-MP is an evolutionary machine. Although it features a new, compact 2,500-gate array Motorola Inc. semiconductor chip, the machine will be cooled with an inert liquid used in sister models and will include some hand-wired panels. The Y-MP's operating software remains Unicos, Cray's version of ATandamp;T's Unix standard. Software written for the X-MP will run on the Y-MP.    But unlike earlier models that could only be connected to one data pipeline, the eight-processor machine can be connected to two. The system also comes with a huge solid-state memory storage device and software that helps assign tasks to processors for more efficient use.    ---                     The Supercomputer Race         MACHINE            PROCESSORS   INTERNAL SPEED*     (YEAR INTRODUCED)        Cray-1 (1976)            1           12.5        Cray X-MP (1982)         2            9.5        Cray-2 (1985)            4            4.1        Cray X-MP/4 (1986)       4            8.5        NEC SX 2-400 (1987)      1            6.0        ETA 10-G (1988)        2-8            7.0        Cray Y-MP (1988)         8            6.0   *In nanoseconds, or billionths of a second</TEXT></DOC>
