It said: &quot;Mason'scredentials are reliable: He is the author of the first 10amendments to our Constitution.&quot;   The drafting of the Bill of Rights was left to the membersof the First Congress in 1789. James Madison, a member of theHouse of Representatives, was on the special committeeresponsible for sifting through the amendments suggested bythe states. The Bill of Rights were framed under hisleadership. One might say then that the framing of the Billof Rights was the work of the First Congress.</LP><TEXT>   George Mason's influence on the Bill of Rights, however,cannot be denied. Mason was the author of Virginia'sDeclaration of Rights (1776), upon which much of the Bill ofRights is based. But if one were attempting to attributeauthorship to one person, one would still have to settle onMadison.   George Mason's understandable prominence in any discussionof the Bill of Rights stems from his motion during theConstitutional Convention (Wednesday, Sept. 12, 1787) that aBill of Rights be added to the proposed Constitution. All ofthe states represented voted down the motion because it wasgenerally believed unnecessary.   Cecilia A.
