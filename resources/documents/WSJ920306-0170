Congressional critics are using the Pentagon's own,recently revised procurement policies to attack the F-22fighter being developed by a team headed by Lockheed Corp.And several competing contractors, some of whose big-ticketprojects already have been killed by the Pentagon, arepouncing on the same arguments in a debate that could set thetone for bitter military spending fights through the year.</LP><TEXT>   A supersonic, twin-engine fighter designed to assure U.S.air superiority in the 21st century, the F-22 until now hasenjoyed a charmed life despite the collapse of the Sovietthreat. The Pentagon in the past few months considered butultimately rejected any move to slash the program, andlawmakers have been loath to target the F-22 because it couldcreate tens of thousands of jobs down the road.   So the radar-evading plane with diamond-shaped wingsremains the military's largest weapons acquisition program --consuming nearly half the Air Force's engineering developmentbudget proposed for next year -- while Defense Secretary DickCheney has resisted all moves to scale back the program ordelay production.   When he recently unveiled his budget priorities, Mr.Cheney emphasized he doesn't expect &quot;any fundamentalalteration&quot; in the F-22. He said the program appears to beadvancing &quot;without any significant problems,&quot; is stayingwithin budget constraints, and is &quot;something we need topursue&quot; despite the end of the Cold War.   The fighter project will survive in some form, butpressure is building to chop funding in the short term andbegin a bruising debate over the F-22's long-term need andcost. At the least, according to lawmakers, congressionalaides and industry lobbyists, Congress is likely to imposemore rigorous testing and manufacturing hurdles beforeproduction can proceed.   Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.), chairman of the ArmedServices subcommittee overseeing the F-22, is part of agrowing band of skeptics relying on the Bush administration'snew, go-slow procurement strategy to justify their attacks onthe plane. Asserting that the Pentagon's intention to rapidlymove the fighter into low-rate production &quot;seems inconsistentwith their own rules,&quot; Sen. Levin said, &quot;I'm going to beasking a lot of questions&quot; about why the F-22 shouldn't beslowed down.   Rep. John Spratt (D., S.C.), a senior member of the HouseArmed Services Committee, agreed that F-22 development shouldcontinue, but predicted it will be one of the prime targetsfor budget-cutters in the next few months.   Kenneth Cannestra, president of Lockheed's AeronauticalSystems Group, said the F-22 retains &quot;strong support inCongress&quot; and is considered to be a model acquisitionprogram. But these days, he acknowledged, &quot;even the mostsuccessful programs are going to be looked at.&quot;   The Air Force and the Lockheed-led team -- which includesBoeing Co. and General Dynamics Corp. as partners -- haveinvested over $5 billion together to develop the F-22. Morethan $10 billion more is earmarked to begin low-rateproduction and acquire 11 test planes and 33 engines by theend of the decade. But the Pentagon's new acquisitionpolicies require production decisions to be put on hold untilthe military need for a new generation of weapons isjustified, engineering risks are minimized, and manufacturinguncertainties are resolved.   Even some Lockheed insiders have acknowledged that thefull 648-plane fleet envisioned by the Air Force will neverbe built. Some internal Pentagon estimates peg the total costof the F-22 at nearly $130 million each -- about 25% higherthan official estimates barely a year ago and three times thecurrent price of a top-of-the-line fighter.   If those figures turn out to be accurate, the Air Forcewill be able to buy barely 400 of the fighters after the year2000 to replace its existing fleet of F-15 Eagles, and theservice will be hard-pressed to find money to buy a separatereplacement for its aging fleet of F-16 fighters.   ---   Jeff Cole in Los Angeles contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
