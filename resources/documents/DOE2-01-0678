Althoughsolar energy will not fulfill all of the energy needs, it can make anincreasing contribution to the energy independence. Solar central receiverpower systems are a promising way to harness solar thermal energy forlarge scale applications. These systems can provide thermal energy overa wide temperature range for plants varying in size from one to severalhundred megawatts. Potential end-use applications include electric powerproduction, and process heat supply for use in a variety of industrialapplications. In the United States alone, more than 100 organizations,including engineering and construction firms, component manufacturers,utilities, industrial process heat users and research centers, have gainedexperience in this technology. Internationally, solar central receiverplants are under construction in Spain, France, Italy and Japan.</TEXT></DOC>
