The central issue will be whether to require non-financial companies to give up majority ownership of trust companies, which are similar to U.S. savings and loan associations.    The House of Commons Finance Committee last summer proposed that non-financial companies be barred from owning more than 30% of financial concerns.    The restrictions could affect holdings of several large Canadian companies, including Brascan Ltd., controlled by Edward and Peter Bronfman; Olympia andamp; York Developments Ltd., owned by the Reichmann family; and Imasco Ltd., controlled by B.A.IT Industries PLC of Britain. These concerns all control large trust companies.    Currently, a company or individual can't control more than 10% of a Canadian national bank, which is a bank that can operate in all the nation's provinces. But there aren't any restrictions on ownership of trust companies, some of which have assets of more than $20 billion (Canadian.)    Another major issue is likely to be access by banks to the securities business. Canada currently restricts banks from owning more than 10% of securities firms. The government today is expected to say that banks can own securities dealers, after a recent decision by Ontario province to allow financial institutions to own 100% of Ontario-based securities firms.    Political sources said Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's cabinet was divided over whether to require non-financial companies to give up majority ownership of trust companies. They said Finance Minister Michael Wilson and the minister of state for finance, Tom Hockin, favored such limits, which would be phased in over a period of years.    A bank executive said he was &quot;amazed&quot; by the government's apparent intention of restricting trust company ownership, as the major trust companies are owned by big corporate interests that are generally &quot;friendly&quot; to the Mulroney administration.    The expected government action, however, follows several bank and trust failures and takeovers of shaky financial institutions by foreign banks. The government delayed its move until now because it wanted to consider the findings of a federally commissioned inquiry into the 1985 failures of two Alberta banks, Canadian Commercial Bank and Northland Bank.    As recommended by the inquiry, the government also is expected to grant more powers to bank regulators.    On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, most major Canadian bank stocks rose, and stocks of Brascan and Imasco, which control trust companies, fell.    Hugh Brown, banking analyst with Burns Fry Ltd., attributed the movements mainly to market expectations that the government will &quot;give or promise to give&quot; some new powers to banks and may place ownership restrictions on trust companies. </TEXT></DOC>
