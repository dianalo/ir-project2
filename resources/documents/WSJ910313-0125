Now, as Yugoslavia's ethnic disputes seemincreasingly likely to boil over into civil war, theseparatist republic's militia is preparing to fightYugoslavia's army.   At a militia training camp, instructors show volunteershow to fire assault weapons and maneuver armored personnelcarriers, and strategists draw up plans to protect suchimportant sites as TV stations. Amid the cracking ofsmall-arms fire, Milan Brezak, an official in the CroatianMinistry of Internal Affairs, says: &quot;If it comes to conflict,people here are prepared to defend themselves -- against anyenemy.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   One enemy lurks just across town. Dragan Pribicevic, aSerb active in protesting the treatment of Serbs in Croatia,says the Serbs, who account for 10% of Croatia's population,&quot;will never accept&quot; the disintegration of Yugoslavia. And theSerbs are in good position to fight any moves towardindependence. They control the national army, making up 75%of its officer corps, and they represent more than a third ofYugoslavia's population.   But Yugoslavia, torn by racial and religious hatred andresurgent ethnic nationalism, is falling apart -- and at anaccelerating rate.   The turbulence isn't confined to secession-mindedrepublics. For the past four days, violent demonstrationshave erupted in Belgrade, the federal capital, asanti-Communist demonstrators have fought soldiers and riotpolice. Two people died, and at least 100 were injured.Yesterday, Belgrade remained tense as thousands of studentsstaged a new round of protests and as representatives of thenation's executive council met to discuss the crisis. Armoredvehicles and police carrying truncheons and tear gas patrolthe city's center.   Even before the clashes, Yugoslavia was sharply divided.Two of its six republics -- Slovenia and Croatia -- havedeclared their sovereignty and are preparing to print theirown money and passports.   But many Serbs are striking back. In Serb-dominated partsof Croatia, they have set up roadblocks and mined railroads,and the region has become dangerous, even impassable. InBosnia-Hercegovina, a republic sandwiched between Serbia andCroatia, Serbs have dynamited television transmitters in aneffort to stop signals from Bosnia's network from leapinginto Serbia. Even the national associations of lawyers,accountants and veterans have broken up.   Fractured by two alphabets, three major religions, fourprincipal languages, five nationalities and dozens of minorsects and ethnic groups, Yugoslavia's 23.8 million people areclassified politically into six republics and two autonomouszones. Even its presidency is divided: The job, currentlyheld by Borisav Jovic, a Serb, is rotated annually amongrepresentatives of the various republics.   Yugoslavia has long been Europe's most fragile country.But right now, &quot;the level of tension is unprecedented,&quot; saysSlaven Letica, special adviser to Croatian President FranjoTudjman. &quot;If shooting starts, we will have bloodshed like noone has seen.&quot;   Though shooting has already started, the likelihood ofescalation into full-blown civil war is difficult to assess;hyperbole as well as tension fills the air. The key to thefuture is the role of the army. Several times in the past sixweeks, it has moved to its highest alert to crack down on anysecessionist moves in the republics. And now, the army -- byallying itself with Serbia's Marxist leadership againstanti-Communist activists -- may accelerate the trend towarddisintegration and conflict.   &quot;Talks hardly seem possible now in a situation where thearmy is being used as an instrument of persuasion,&quot; saysMario Nobilo, a spokesman for Croatian President Tudjman.   Recently, army brigades using tanks and helicopters werepatrolling Croatia's capital, Zagreb, to enforce a federalarrest warrant for Martin Spegelj, the Croatian defenseminister. Serbs accuse him of buying Hungarian arms forCroatian secessionists. Croatia responds that it would go towar before handing over Mr. Spegelj, who, it contends, soughtthe arms under the republic's right to self-defense. Hetravels around Zagreb these days in an armed convoy tovarious safehouses.   As a result of such conflicts, Croatia's Mr. Tudjman hasboycotted talks with the chiefs of other republics inBelgrade to discuss transforming Yugoslavia into a looser&quot;confederation&quot; of sovereign nations -- a sort of smallEuropean Community in the Balkans. Without Croatia, whoserepresentatives refused to cross an angry picket line ofSerbs accusing Croatians of fascism, other republics walkedout, too.   In many ways, Yugoslavia already seems a country on thebrink of war. The top item on the evening television news isregularly about people buying weapons; recently, Croatian TVinterviewed the grumbling police chief of a town near theHungarian border who held up a thick stack of newapplications for gun permits. And an outbreak of violenceanywhere could embroil other republics. &quot;Slovenia would be insolidarity with Croatia&quot; in any confrontation with the army,says Slovene Prime Minister Lojze Peterle.   Talk of war in the Balkans seems like a throwback toanother era, the era in which, eventually, the assassinationof Archduke Francis Ferdinand sparked World War I. TheYugoslav federation, which was stitched together from thetattered Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires in 1918, haslong suffered from cultural clashes. Although no world warwould be likely to result from Yugoslavia's feuds this time,the country's breakup would dramatically affect thepolitical, economic and social landscape of Europe.   To the west, Italy and Austria are bracing for a wave ofrefugees if war erupts in Yugoslavia. Such an influx --perhaps as many as 100,000 people into Austria alone -- wouldexacerbate Western Europe's problems with refugees from theEast.   In Yugoslavia, the political turmoil is damaging thealready-depressed economy. Domestic and foreign investmenthas shrunk, output plunged 10% last year, and tens ofthousands of people have lost their jobs in communities whereunemployment had long been virtually unknown. Any furtherdisintegration would raise big doubts about the future,especially about who would take responsibility for thenation's foreign debt, which exceeds $16 billion.   Moreover, Yugoslavia sits in a strategically importantposition, a bridge between Western and Eastern countries andbetween Christian and Muslim religions. Six of Yugoslavia'sseven neighbors have a territorial claim against it, andsome, such as Bulgaria, might press harder if Yugoslavialacked any central authority. Such claims could requireintervention by other countries to preserve current borders.And an upheaval in Yugoslavia could inflame the minoritydisputes rife in most of Eastern Europe -- and in WesternEurope, too.   &quot;Yugoslavia is still strategically important, but theimportance has changed,&quot; says Christopher Cviic, an expert atLondon's Royal Institute of International Affairs. &quot;WhileYugoslavia used to worry about its neighbors, now itsneighbors worry about Yugoslavia.&quot;   Concerned about the dangers, the U.S. and EC have beenpressing the Yugoslavs to settle their differencespeacefully. But few signs of compromise have appeared.Slovenian officials say they aren't interested in remainingin a confederation and add that the republic could beginmoving toward secession as early as mid-June. Meanwhile, theSerbs say that if any republic secedes, they will press toredraw the remaining internal frontiers to encompass more ofthe land where Serbs live; that could spark furtherconfrontation.   The federal government's latest plan to halt thedisintegration is to negotiate a new constitution based onwhat it calls the republics' &quot;minimum common interests,&quot;including a single foreign policy and customs union. Butwhether such a proposal will succeed is far from certain.   The current mood contrasts with the immediate postwaryears, when Yugoslavia's charismatic dictator, Marshal Tito,provided the glue that held the country together. Under him,Yugoslavia quit the Soviet bloc, opened its borders andstruck out on a nonaligned path of economic and politicaldevelopment. For a time, Yugoslavia seemed about the bestanyone could hope for in a Communist country.   But after Tito died in 1980, the glue dissolved. The onlycountry that Yugoslavia can really compare itself to, oddlyenough, is the one Tito thought he left behind in 1949: theSoviet Union. People here bet that Yugoslavia will break upfirst.   The past year of upheaval in Eastern Europe has worsenedYugoslavia's tensions. The first multiparty elections in morethan half a century produced free-market, Western-leaninggovernments in most of Yugoslavia, including Slovenia andCroatia. Meantime, Serbia remains controlled by a Marxiststrongman, Slobodan Milosevic, who wants the country toremain united under the leadership of a stronger Serbia.   The economic crisis has underscored the sharp contrastsbetween regions and fueled ethnic tensions. In Slovenia,which is nearer Munich than Belgrade and where people driveMercedes-Benz cars on superhighways, per capita income isnearly 1,000% higher than in the poorest parts of the south,where people travel in horse-drawn carts and eke out a livingon small farms.   On a snowy street in Ljubljana, Slovenia's capital, MarkoHocevar sells once-outlawed nationalist items, including keychains, decals and leather wallets embossed &quot;SlovenianPassport&quot; in gold letters. &quot;Everyone here wantsindependence,&quot; the peddler says. &quot;The rest of the country isholding us back.&quot; Last December, a referendum found nine outof 10 Slovenians favored secession. Says Prime MinisterPeterle: &quot;The time has passed when there was any supportingevidence for the principle of a united Yugoslavia.&quot;   But in Zagreb, Mr. Pribicevic, the Serbian activist, saysYugoslavia can't be split up peacefully because minoritygroups from various republics are spread all across thecountry. &quot;Croatia can't secede because Croatia wasn't madeonly by Croats but also by Serbs,&quot; he says. &quot;If it comes tosplitting, we Serbs will never accept it.&quot;   Against that backdrop, people live in a sort of suspendedanimation, uncertain about the present and even moreuncertain about the future. &quot;We continue with our daily life,but it is very difficult to concentrate,&quot; says IngridBadurina, a Yugoslav journalist. At the Klub Maksimir, astylish restaurant in the hills near Zagreb, the most populardish is called Beef Apocalypse. Says a waiter: &quot;The nameaccurately describes our customers' mood.&quot;   ---                                                                                                        Percent of total population (23.8 million)                                                                                                        Serbs                              36.3% Croats                             19.7% Muslims                             8.9% Slovenes                            7.8% Albanians                           7.7% Macedonians                         5.9% Yugoslavs                           5.4% Other                               3.9% Montenegrins                        2.5% Hungarians                          1.9%                                                                                                        Source: Central Intelligence Agency</TEXT></DOC>
