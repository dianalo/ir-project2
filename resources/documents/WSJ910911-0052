The Japanese computer giant's U.S. unit submitted a bidthis summer to sell a machine to the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency, and plans to enter one this month to theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration. It's alsoconsidering competing on another NASA contract later thisyear, an NEC spokesman said.</LP><TEXT>   If any of NEC's bids are successful, it would be the firsttime a U.S. government agency has purchased a Japanesesupercomputer.   Until now, the U.S. has officially directed government anduniversity organizations to buy only American-madeultrapowerful computers. But that position has become awkwardas the U.S. pushes Japan to open its own governmentsupercomputer market to American products. Just over a yearago, Japan revised its official bidding process forsupercomputers, and Cray Research Inc. of Minneapolis hassince won three contracts.   NEC sold its first supercomputer in North America in 1986to a university research consortium in Houston. This year itwon a contract to supply a supercomputer to Canada'senvironmental agency.   NASA's decision to open the contract to foreign bids hasdrawn criticism from House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt(D., Mo.) who argued it should be limited to U.S. companies.Opponents of opening up the bidding say the NASA contractinvolves national security data.</TEXT></DOC>
