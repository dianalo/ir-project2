(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nobody would have guessed, least of all14-year-old Jamie White.   But as it turned out, her keen eye for casual fashion hasbrightened the lives of thousands of deprived American youngsters,and will, apparently, for years to come.   She was with her father and a church group on a trip to Antiguain the West Indies in 1987 when she saw some simple cotton shirtsand shorts fashioned from flour and sugar bags fluttering from aclothesline. She liked them so much she bought them from the womanwho made them.   ``On the plane back home, she began discussing making andselling flour sack clothes,'' her father, Joe White, says. ``By thetime we got back home, we'd carved out a lot of ideas.''   White and his wife, Debbie Jo, operate four Christian,non-denominational sports camps in the scenic Ozark Mountains ofsouthwestern Missouri that each summer attract 5,000 children ages8 to 18 from 44 states and 11 other countries.   The family decided that any clothing profits would go towardtheir dream of opening additional camps solely for inner city andmentally handicapped children from across the nation.   A non-profit foundation has purchased 150 acres on Table RockLake for the new camps, which the Whites hope to open in 1991.   Jamie, a sandy-haired 14-year-old with braces, has seen hersimple idea grow into a line of cotton T-shirts, tops, shorts,sweat shirts, sweat pants and blue-jean vests. They are marketedfor girls 13 to 16 under the White Sands Clothing Co. label.   White says the family-run business has sold about $200,000 worthof clothing in its first year, mostly to Little Rock, Ark.-basedDillard Department Stores. The Nordstrom's department store chainalso carries some White Sands garments, and Macy's has expressed aninterest in next year's lines, White says.   Orders for next year are rolling in, and White expects businessto at least double in 1990.   ``This is a Cinderella story, all the way. We're David competingagainst the Goliaths, like Esprit and Guess,'' he says.   A benefactor of the camps put the Whites, who had no previousexperience in the garment industry, in touch with Mike Dillard,president of Dillard Department Stores.   The chain liked Jamie's designs for a line of shorts and topslike the Antigua flour and sugar bag garments and featured them inlast spring's line.   Jamie also sold Dillard's on about 25 varieties of neonT-shirts, shorts and tops for summer, along with knit jerseys andjean vests adorned with dozens of costume jewelry pieces, buttonsand beads for fall.   For Christmas, Dillard is carrying a line of White Sands sweatshirts with holiday themes.   ``We've just now gained the respect of stores and they'resaying, `Hey, these guys are a real company, they can reallyproduce clothes,''' White says.   His soft-spoken daughter admits she doubted the business wouldget off the ground.   ``I thought it was going to be something we'd try to do butwouldn't really get started,'' she says. ``It's really done well.''   Jamie, the oldest of the Whites' four children, ``has anincredible knack for seeing what will sell in department stores.It's a sixth sense,'' her father says.   Jamie does the designing but relies on Rick Mumford, one of1,000 camp counselors and an art major at Southwest Missouri StateUniversity, to actually put her ideas on fabric.   ``The kids at camp also help me design and tell me what theylike and would buy,'' she says.   The clothes are cut, sewn and screened at factories in Ozark,Ava and Shell Knob, Mo. The fledgling company employs three peoplefull time and has about a dozen part-time workers, including asaleswoman.   Jamie attends trade shows in New York, where the new White Sandslines are exhibited to buyers from major clothing companies.   She says she gets a thrill every time she's in a departmentstore and sees the clothing she has designed for other teen-agegirls displayed next to big name lines.   ``I'll see people looking through the racks and it's like, `Ohmy gosh, they're buying my clothes!''' she says.   But that's not the greatest thrill.   For the past 10 years, about 400 ghetto and mentally handicappedchildren have spent a week each August at Kanakuk Kamps, which werebegun by White's father, Spike White, in 1954. Children canparticipate in 30 sports, from baseball to horseback riding towater skiing.   ``It's just a joy to see those kids having so much fun doingthings they'd never get to do otherwise,'' Jamie says. ``And theyget a chance to know Christ and develop everlasting friendships.''   What of the future for this clothes designing ingenue?   ``I never had a dream to be a designer. I like to be outsidedoing athletic things. I'd rather be a camp director.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
