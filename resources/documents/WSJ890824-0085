And for the company that wrote an insurance policy on the cornfield, it was hell.    Blistering heat and the 1988 summer drought nearly ruined the field. Just three weeks before filming was due to start, the parched corn barely reached Mr. Costner's knees. Seeing not a cloud in the sky, Fireman's Fund Corp. had to shell out $200,000 for a makeshift irrigation system that tapped a nearby creek.    &quot;Mother Nature got us that time,&quot; says Denise Dimon, a Fireman's Fund claims adjuster in Los Angeles. The bite could have been worse: Without a cornfield, there might have been no movie. Without a movie, the production company stood to lose more than $10 million.    Last year, Hollywood released some 500 films, which made about $4.5 billion at the box office. But if not for insurance, the industry would soon be out of business, for few investors are willing to risk their money unless there are safety nets.    A tight filming schedule is easily derailed by a star who sprains an ankle, a stunt that backfires and burns down a set, a mishap that destroys valuable negatives or a thief who makes off with equipment. Insurers pay the tab for such mishaps, and they have to be agile to get a production crew back on its feet. Downtime in Hollywood can cost big bucks -- about $500 a minute, or $250,000 a day.    What's more, increasingly elaborate productions and swelling budgets are making insurance ever more important. Policies in the '50s seldom covered much beyond damage to props; now they commonly apply to all sorts of risks inherent in exotic locations, death-defying stunts and sophisticated special effects. With films today costing an average of $19 million, the insurer of a major picture might have as much as $75 million on the line. The price of such coverage is usually 1% to 3% of a movie's budget.    Although insuring movies can be lucrative -- such policies brought in between $250 million and $300 million for insurers in 1988 -- the headaches it entails can be enormous. One of the biggest so far resulted when Natalie Wood died during the filming of &quot;Brainstorm.&quot; MGM wanted to abandon the movie and collect from its insurers. But underwriters at Lloyds of London thought it would be cheaper to complete the film, using a stand-in for Ms. Wood in the scenes that remained. Lloyds got its way, but it still had to pay about $8 million in claims to cover production delays.    More recently, filming of &quot;Karate Kid III&quot; was delayed for several days when star Ralph Macchio ran into some poison oak, costing the movie's insurer about $100,000. And a broken arm took actress Sean Young out of &quot;Batman&quot; 10 days before the cameras were ready to roll and nearly forced the Caped Crusader to stalk Gotham's nasties solo. Warner Bros.' insurer paid the costs of finding a replacement (Kim Basinger), of buying the necessary new wardrobe and of juggling the production schedule to accommodate reshooting. The total bill came to well over half a million dollars.    If Hollywood's insurers toil in a world of make-believe, they must still come up with real-life ways to minimize their losses. The special effects for &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; required a battery of hot lights and equipment that would have triggered the studio's sprinkler system. The sprinklers were turned off, but the insurer demanded that a fire company be on the set at all times.    Determining premium rates for a movie can be a rather arbitrary process. A higher deductible here, a lower loss limit there -- such factors can make a big difference in the bottom line. For &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,&quot; the latest installment in Steven Spielberg's adventure series, obtaining insurance meant getting more rats.    In one scene, Harrison Ford and his blond sidekick wade through a dank underground chamber teeming with rats. Lucasfilm Ltd., the producer, had 2,000 rats specially bred for the scene. It asked Fireman's Fund to insure the rodents and cover the cost of any delays in filming if the production company lost a large number of the animals.    But the insurer demanded &quot;a 1,000-rat deductible,&quot; meaning that it wouldn't pay any claims resulting from the loss of the first 1,000 rats. So Lucasfilm lined up an extra 1,000 rats as a cushion.    When one of the drug-dealing hoods in the James Bond thriller &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; was about to cut the ropes that held Timothy Dalton suspended above a giant shredder, the knife slipped. Her Majesty's favorite secret agent was left with a deep gash in his right hand.    The producer could have lost nearly $100,000 if he had been forced to close up shop for the rest of the day. But LifeStar International, a Washington-based medical consulting group, had been retained for just such emergencies at the remote filming site in Mexico. The doctor on the set repaired the damaged tendon in Mr. Dalton's hand and, with the help of a makeup artist, fashioned a latex bandage out of a surgical glove. The star was back in front of the cameras in about an hour.    Without the LifeStar unit on the set, Mr. Dalton probably would have had to fly to Los Angeles for surgery. Chubb Corp., which insured &quot;Licence to Kill,&quot; is said to have given the producer a discount of more than $20,000 on its premium (which totaled about $525,000) because of the physician on call.    Insuring such big stars as Elizabeth Taylor and Tom Cruise doesn't cost more than covering B-movie actors, unless they are in bad health. All movie insurers require actors to have a physical exam before starting every film. Some of the insurers keep medical files on the stars they have covered, including notations on which have drinking or drug problems, which have a tendency to get sick during projects and which show up late for every cast call.    Many insurers refused entirely to write a policy for John Huston's &quot;The Dead&quot; because of the legendary director's poor health. Fireman's Fund eventually agreed, but it insisted on having an ambulance on the set and a nurse to accompany Mr. Huston at all times. The insurer also required a backup director -- a position filled by Mr. Huston's son -- who could finish the film if Mr. Huston had proved too ill to complete it. (Mr. Huston died shortly after finishing the movie.)    Although insurers take painstaking steps to limit losses, they can't control everything. &quot;You think you might know it all,&quot; says Sal Nociforo, executive vice president of an American International Group entertainment division in New York. &quot;But when you're insuring a film, there are very many unknowns.&quot;    The insurer that covered Francis Ford Coppola's &quot;Apocalypse Now,&quot; shot in the Philippines, had carefully researched the typhoon season and refused to cover damages caused by those storms during a specified four-month span. Unfortunately, the first typhoon that year hit about five days earlier than normal.    The insurer had to pay $1.5 million to rebuild a jungle village set destroyed by the storm -- even though it would be set on fire in the closing sequence of the movie. &quot;There had to be a set to torch,&quot; explains Richard Youens, a group executive director with Graham, Miller andamp; Co. Ltd.    Fireman's Fund, for its part, acknowledges that the request to insure the cornfield in &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; was a bit unorthodox. The company took on the job after checking with the U.S. Weather Service to see if the forecast rain would be sufficient. Even more reassuring was the report of the movie's farm adviser, who had selected a special fast-growing seed to develop tall, beautiful green stalks.    Nobody figured on the drought, however, during which the corn grew at only half its usual pace. Even after irrigation -- which angered neighboring farmers whose own fields were turning brown -- the Iowa cornfield still wasn't ready for the cameras in late June. As evidence for its claim, the producers measured the corn daily and recorded it on videotape. The cast and crew sat idle for two days, literally watching the corn grow.    Through it all, Don Lansing, whose farm was used in the movie, couldn't help thinking that Hollywood should have come the year before. His 1987 crop, he notes, reached full height three weeks early. </TEXT></DOC>
