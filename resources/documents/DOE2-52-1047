Researchesto be developed on metals solid and gaseous compounds, solution chemistry,thermodynamic properties, oxidation degree, chemical species in solutionnon aqueous media, chemical reaction kinetics and chemistry at the atomscale are reviewed. These studies have an interest from a theoreticalpoint of views on 5 f elements and practical because of heavy elementproduction in the nuclear fuel cycle.</TEXT></DOC>
