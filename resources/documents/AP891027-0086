The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidintelligence reports indicated that South Africa last summer testeda modified version of the Israeli-made Jericho II medium-rangemissile at Armaston on the Indian Ocean coast near Capetown.   Israel test-fired its own Jericho II missile over theMediterranean last year, he said. Both missiles have a 900-milerange.   The two countries, which have had an extensive defenserelationship since the 1960s, also are cooperating in thedevelopment of a long-range missile that could be used to launchreconnaissance satellites into space, the official said.   A long-range version of the Jericho _ known as the Shavit, whichis Hebrew for comet _ was used to launch an Israeliphoto-reconnaissance satellite earlier this year from the NegevDesert, the official said. Media reports then described the rocketas a multistage missile having a 2,000-mile range.   Responding to reports about the nuclear cooperation, the StateDepartment urged Israel to sign the international NuclearNon-Proliferation Treaty, which it has refused to do for fear ofopening its facilities to international inspection.   ``We have repeatedly urged Israel and other non-signatories'' tojoin the pact, the department said in statement issued lateThursday. ``We reiterate that call.''   Both Israel and South Africa have denied they are sharing suchtechnology.   ``I bear no knowledge whatsoever of such cooperation,'' saidSouth African Foreign Minister Pik Botha.   In Jerusalem today, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said thereports of Israeli-South African nuclear cooperation were designedto ``tear the fabric'' of U.S.-Israeli relations at a time whenIsrael was trying to bridge differences with Secretary of StateJames A. Baker III about peace talks with Palestinians.   Under intense U.S. pressure, Israel announced in 1987 that itwould not sign any new defense contracts with South Africa butwould honor existing ones.   The State Department and the Pentagon refused to discuss thematter.   ``We do not comment on intelligence matters. The U.S. policy ofopposition to the proliferation of missiles and nuclear weapons iswell known,'' said State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.   Ms. Tutwiler said the U.S. ambassador in Israel had brought upsimilar reports of nuclear proliferation with Israel in the past.Israel turned down the protest of former ambassador ThomasPickering, The Washington Post reported in today's editions.   And when a senior State Department official brought up the issuewith a visiting Israeli delegation last spring, ``he was stiffed,just absolutely stiffed on it,'' the Post quoted an unidentifiedsource as saying.   Israel and South Africa reportedly also are cooperating ondevelopment of a South African jet fighter known as the Cheetah. Itis a modified version of the Israeli Lavi fighter that was scrappedunder strong U.S. pressure in the final stages of its developmenttwo years ago.   The assistant secretary of state for African affairs, HermanCohen, indirectly confirmed recently that there had been somecooperation between the two countries on intermediate-rangemissiles.   Israel has pledged to phase out its defense ties with SouthAfrica, Cohen said in a television interview, but added, ``I amassuming cooperation of intermediate range ballistic missiles comesunder existing contracts.''   NBC-TV reported that South Africa was providing Israel withenriched uranium for its own nuclear warheads. Neither country hasadmitted having nuclear weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
