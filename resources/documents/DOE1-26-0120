Silica-alumina fibersare ideal. Apparent density, thermal conductivity, and {radical}{lambda}/rhoare compared for insulating bricks and fiber products. Fiber productshave an open porosity andgt;85%, which means that the kiln atmosphere penetratesthe lining, leading to corrosion problems. The construction and performanceof a ceramic kiln are described. 3 figs. (DLC)</TEXT></DOC>
