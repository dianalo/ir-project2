Two valves for controlling the flow of fluid through the device      are situated serially within the fluid flow path between the inlet and the      outlet. The fluid flow path includes a first fluid conduit which directs      fluid through both valves, and a second fluid conduit which bypasses the      first valve and directs fluid only through the second valve. The first      valve is constructed to provide a greater resistance to flow through the      device than the second valve, and when the second fluid conduit is      unobstructed, fluid will tend to flow through the second fluid conduit and      bypass the first valve. A plug is integrally formed with a portion of the      encasement, for occluding the second fluid conduit. The plug can be      inserted into a receiving collar to occlude the second fluid conduit, by      manual percutaneous pressure, thereby requiring all fluid flow through the      device to pass through the first fluid conduit. A siphen control device is      provided between the valves and the outlet to prevent fluid flow in the      absence of positive upstream fluid pressure or in response to negative      downstream hydrostatic pressure on the outlet of the device. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention relates generally to surgically implanted physiological      shunt systems and related flow control devices. More particularly, the      present invention relates to shunt systems including one-way flow control      valves for controlling the flow of cerebrospinal fluid out of a brain      ventricle and preventing backflow of fluid into the brain ventricle. </PAR><PAR>  In the medical arts, to relieve undesirable accumulation of fluids it is      frequently necessary to provide a means for draining a fluid from one part      of the human body to another in a controlled manner. This is required, for      example, in the treatment of hydrocephalus, a ailment usually afflicting      infants or children in which fluids accumulate within the skull and exert      extreme pressure and skull deforming forces. </PAR><PAR>  In treating hydrocephalus, cerebrospinal fluid accumulated in the brain      ventricles is typically drained away utilizing a drainage or shunt system      including a catheter inserted into the ventricle through the skull, which      is connected to a tube which conducts the fluid away from the brain to be      reintroduced into the peritoneal cavity or into the vascular system, as by      extending a distal catheter through the patient's jugular vein to the      atrium portion of the heart. To control the flow of cerebrospinal fluid      and maintain the proper pressure in the brain ventricle, a pump or valve      is placed in the conduit between the brain and the peritoneal cavity or      the heart. An exemplary flow control device is found in U.S. Pat. No.      4,560,375. </PAR><PAR>  Although such drainage systems have provided successful results, a problem      of over drainage of the cerebrospinal fluid from the brain ventricles      sometimes exists. Over drainage of cerebrospinal fluid may result in      excessive reduction of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure within the brain      ventricles and predispose the development of a subdural hematoma or      hydroma, and excessive reduction of ventricular size leading to shunt      obstruction because of impingement of the ventricular walls on the inlet      holes of the ventricular catheter. This over drainage can be caused by the      siphoning effect of hydrostatic pressure in the distal shunt catheter. The      siphoning effect of hydrostatic pressure may be created by the elevation      of the ventricular catheter inlet with respect to the distal catheter      outlet (i.e., when the patient sits, stands or is held erect). In order to      prevent such over drainage caused by the siphoning effect of hydrostatic      pressure in the distal shunt catheter, siphon control devices have been      placed in the conduit, typically between the flow control device and the      peritoneal cavity or the heart. An exemplary siphon control device is      found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,795,437. </PAR><PAR>  It is desirable in some instances to permit the physician to be able to      alter the flow characteristics through the drainage system after it has      been subcutaneously implanted. To this end, on-off devices have been      provided for implantation as a portion of the fluid conduit, as an      additional element of the shunt. An exemplary on-off device is shown in      U.S. Pat. No. 3,827,439. </PAR><PAR>  Prior physiological shunt systems have failed to provide, however, a flow      control device which permits only unidirectional flow through the shunt      system, prevents over drainage caused by the siphoning effect of      hydrostatic pressure in the distal shunt catheter, and permits the flow      characteristics through the shunt to be altered by means of percutaneous      pressure after the shunt system has been surgically implanted. Further,      existing flow control devices extensively used in connection with the      treatment of hydrocephalus typically provide only a single pre-set      resistance to the flow of excess cerebrospinal fluid through the shunt      system, which cannot be varied except to prevent fluid flow through the      shunt by means of an on-off valve. </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly, there has been a continuing need in the medical arts for      convenient and effective physiological drainage devices for controlling      the flow of fluid from one part of the body to another, which are      relatively inexpensive to manufacture and can be constructed substantially      of non-metallic parts which are not subject to adhering to one another and      causing a malfunction of the device. A flow control device is needed which      permits fluid flow therethrough only when upstream fluid pressure exceeds      downstream fluid pressure by a selected pressure differential, and which      also provides means for altering the selected pressure differential by      manual percutaneous manipulation of the device when it is subcutaneously      implanted. </PAR><PAR>  Additionally, a novel flow control device for use in a physiological shunt      system is needed which utilizes a plurality of flow control valves having      different flow control characteristics. Such a device should provide      alternative fluid pathways therethrough such that selection of the desired      fluid pathway can be made by the selective application of percutaneous      manual pressure to the device when it is subcutaneously implanted.      Moreover, such a flow control device is needed which incorporates an      integral siphon control device that opens only in response to positive      upstream fluid pressure, and recloses or remains closed in the absence of      such positive upstream fluid pressure or in response to negative      downstream hydrostatic pressure on the device. As will become apparent      from the following description, the present invention satisfies these      needs and provides other related advantages. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention resides in a physiological shunt system for      controlling the flow of fluid from one part of the body to another, which      is constructed substantially of non-metallic materials and provides      trouble-free and reliable operation in use. The shunt system of the      present invention is relatively inexpensive to manufacture, and can be      easily modified to provide a variety of pressure/flow characteristics. In      accordance with the present invention, a flow control device for use in a      subcutaneously implanted physiological shunt system includes a housing      having an inlet and an outlet, a fluid flow path through the housing from      the inlet to the outlet, and means for controlling fluid flow through the      fluid flow path. The controlling means includes means for permitting fluid      flow through the fluid flow path when upstream fluid pressure exceeds      downstream fluid pressure by a selected pressure differential, and means      for altering the selected pressure differential by manual percutaneous      manipulation of the flow control device when it is subcutaneously      implanted. </PAR><PAR>  In a preferred form of the invention, the controlling means includes a      first normally closed valve which opens to permit fluid flow through the      fluid flow path when upstream fluid pressure exceeds downstream fluid      pressure by a first pressure differential, and a second normally closed      valve which opens to permit fluid flow through the fluid flow path when      upstream fluid pressure exceeds downstream fluid pressure by a second      pressure differential. Preferably, the first pressure differential is      greater than the second pressure differential. </PAR><PAR>  The fluid flow path includes a first fluid conduit for directing fluid      through the first and second normally closed valves, and a second fluid      conduit which bypasses the first normally closed valve and directs fluid      through the second normally closed valve only. The means for altering the      selected pressure differential comprises means for selectively directing      fluid either through the first or second fluid conduits. </PAR><PAR>  The first and second normally closed valves each include a base having a      valve passageway therethrough, and a valve seat surrounding a portion of      the valve passageway. A flow control member is attached to each base so as      to contact the valve seat in a manner normally occluding the valve      passageway, but selectively opening to permit controlled unidirectional      flow therethrough. Each flow control member includes a central support and      a resilient membrane. The central support is attached to the base and      extends therefrom to support the resilient membrane. The resilient      membrane is generally arch-shaped and has a portion thereof capable of      engaging the valve seat to occlude the valve passageway. </PAR><PAR>  A variety of pressure/flow characteristics can be provided by the flow      control device of the present invention by manufacturing the normally      closed valves with different resilient membranes of varying thicknesses.      The resistance to flow past a normally closed valve increases with an      increase in membrane thickness. </PAR><PAR>  The means for selectively directing fluid either through the first or      second fluid conduits includes means for occluding the second fluid      conduit means. This occluding means includes a plug insertable into the      second fluid conduit by manual percutaneous pressure applied to the      device. The plug is retained within a collar to occlude the second fluid      conduit and thus require all fluid flow through the device to pass through      the first fluid conduit. The plug can be dislodged from the collar to open      the second fluid conduit by additional selective manual percutaneous      manipulation of the device. </PAR><PAR>  In order to provide the desired resistance to adhesion between various      components of the flow control device, particularly during storage, rigid      components of the valve are generally formed of a rigid polypropylene      material, while elastic components, such as the valve resilient membranes,      are preferably molded of a silicone elastomer material. </PAR><PAR>  An intermediate fluid passageway between the inlet and the normally closed      valves is configured to provide a flushing reservoir, and integral flow      occluders are provided generally adjacent to the inlet and the outlet, all      of which are operated by percutaneous finger pressure applied to the      device. Through selective application of percutaneous pressure to the flow      occluders and the flushing reservoir, fluid within the reservoir can be      selectively flushed both proximally and distally through the device. </PAR><PAR>  A siphon control device is situated between the normally closed valves and      the outlet, to prevent fluid flow through the flow control device in the      absence of positive upstream fluid pressure or in response to negative      downstream hydrostatic pressure. The siphon control device comprises an      integral housing including a pair of spaced, substantially parallel,      flexible diaphragms, and a base invested within the housing. The base and      housing define a fluid flow pathway between the normally closed valves and      the outlet. </PAR><PAR>  Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent      from the following more detailed description, taken in conjunction with      the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, the      principles of the invention. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  The accompanying drawings illustrate the invention.

The      improved flow control device 10 is intended for use in a surgically      implanted physiological shunt system for draining fluid from one portion      of the body to another. In order to connect, for example, the device 10 in      such a system, the device includes an inlet connector 12 and an outlet      connector 14 which each receive one end of a piece of surgical tubing (not      shown). The ends of the surgical tubing are placed over the connectors 12      and 14 and secured thereon by a single ligature just inside of an annular      ridge 16 formed near the end of each connector. </PAR><PAR>  When the flow control device 10 is used in a drainage system intended for      the treatment of hydrocephalus, the inlet connector 12 is fluidly      connected with a proximal catheter which is inserted through the skull      into a brain ventricle containing cerebrospinal fluid under pressure. The      outlet connector 14 is fluidly connected to a distal catheter which serves      to discharge cerebrospinal fluid into, for example, the atrium portion of      a patient's heart. Ordinarily the flow control device 10 will be      surgically implanted on the patient's skull with a flap of skin overlying      the device. To facilitate holding the device in its desired position after      implantation, a generally flexible mounting plate 18 can be provided with      one or more suture holes. </PAR><PAR>  As will become apparent from the following description, the present      invention provides a highly reliable flow control device having selectable      alternative fluid pathways which permit the flow control characteristics      of the device 10 to be altered when subcutaneously implanted by manual      percutaneous manipulation of the device. The present invention provides a      highly reliable flow control device designed to prevent valve seat      deformation and membrane to valve seat sticking, and to facilitate      implantation by eliminating components to be connected or adjusted other      than the surgical tubing to the device itself. </PAR><PAR>  In accordance with the present invention, the flow control device 10      includes a pair of relatively rigid, molded plastic bases 20 and 22      invested within a resiliently flexible housing 24 which, together, define      a fluid flow path through the housing from the inlet connector 12 to the      outlet connector 14. Two normally closed valves 26 and 28 are provided      within the fluid flow path to restrict the flow of fluid through the      device 10. The housing 24 and the second base 22 cooperate to provide a      siphon control device 30, situated between the valves 26 and 28 and the      outlet connector 14, which prevents fluid flow through the device 10 in      the absence of positive upstream fluid pressure or in response to negative      downstream hydrostatic pressure on the device. Further, the housing 24 and      the first base 20 cooperate to define a pump or flushing reservoir 32      between the inlet connector 12 and the valves 26 and 28. </PAR><PAR>  Two alternative fluid conduits, defining portions of the fluid flow path      through the device 10, are provided in order to permit the flow control      characteristics of the device 10 to be altered by manual percutaneous      pressure applied to the device when subcutaneously implanted. A first      fluid conduit 34 directs fluid through both the first and second normally      closed valves 26 and 28. A second fluid conduit 36 bypasses the first      normally closed valve 26 and directs fluid through the second normally      closed valve 28 only. </PAR><PAR>  More specifically, and as shown best in FIGS. 2-7, the bases 20 and 22      interfit with one another and are integrally formed with, respectively,      the inlet and outlet connectors 12 and 14. The first base 20 is integrally      formed with the inlet connector 12 and defines an inlet flow channel 38      extending the inlet connector 12 to an upwardly facing inlet occluder port      40. The first base 20 further forms a bottom plate 42 for the flushing      reservoir 32, and a generally cylindrical receptacle 44 which receives a      portion of the second base 22. </PAR><PAR>  The second base 22 is integrally formed with the outlet connector 14 and      includes a generally cylindrical valve housing 46 which is received, in an      interference fit, into the receptacle 44 of the first base 20. The valve      housing 46 includes a housing key 48 which snap-fits into an aperture      provided through the receptacle 44, for the purpose of properly aligning      the second base 22 with respect to the first base 20. The second base 22      defines a valve housing outlet flow channel 50 which terminates at an      upwardly facing outlet occluder port 52. Between the outlet occluder port      52 and the outlet connector 14, the second base 22 defines a portion of      the siphon control device 30. </PAR><PAR>  The flexible housing 24 is provided in two parts: an inlet housing portion      24a in which the first base 20 and a portion of the second base 22 are      invested, and an outlet housing portion 24b which is sealed by a suitable      adhesive 54 to the inlet housing portion 24a in order to provide a      continuous elastomeric exterior to the device 10, with the exception of      the inlet and outlet connectors 12 and 14 which extend therefrom. The      inlet housing portion 24a is integrally formed with the mounting plate 18      and includes an inlet aperture through which the inlet connector 12      extends, an inlet occluder wing 56 which generally overlies the inlet      occluder port 40, and a resiliently flexible dome 58 for the flushing      reservoir 32. The inlet housing 24a surrounds the receptacle 44 and      adjacent portions of the second base 22, and includes a recess 60 in which      an engaging flange 62 of the outlet housing 24b is secured by means of the      adhesive 54. </PAR><PAR>  In order to provide a fluid-tight seal between the inlet connector 12 and      the housing 24a, a tube 64 is placed over a portion of the inlet connector      and secured in place by means of an over suture 66. A silicone adhesive 68      is then injected into the remaining gap between the housing 24a and the      inlet connector 12. This same sealing arrangement is made between the      housing 24b and the outlet connector 14. </PAR><PAR>  The inlet occluder wing 56 is positioned over the inlet occluder port 40 to      facilitate occluding the inlet flow channel 38 at the port 40 by pressing      the wing 56 downwardly. Depressing the wing 56 and occluding the port 40      prevents proximal fluid flow from the flushing reservoir 32, defined by      the dome 58 and the bottom plate 42, when the dome is pressed downwardly      by manual percutaneous pressure (see FIG. 5). The dome 58 is preferably      molded of a silicone elastomer material and is designed to permit      injection into the flow control device 10 by a hypodermic needle through      the dome. The bases 20 and 22 are preferably molded of a polypropylene      material which provides sufficient rigidity to prevent a needle from      inadvertently passing through the device 10 if an injection is made into      the flushing reservoir 32. The construction of the bases 20 and 22 and the      housing 24 helps to guide a physician in manually percutaneously      manipulating the device 10 when subcutaneously implanted, for purposes of      flushing the shunt system and/or altering the flow characteristics of the      flow control device. </PAR><PAR>  The outlet housing portion 24b surrounds a portion of the second base 22 to      define the siphon control device 30 which is similar to that shown and      described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,795,437, the contents of which are      incorporated herein by reference. The siphon control device 30 includes an      outer wall 70 and an inner wall 72 which is situated within and encircled      about by the outer wall. The valve housing outlet flow channel 50 channels      fluid from the second normally closed valve 28 to a central SCD reservoir      74 defined as the area between the inner wall 72 and the outer wall 70. An      outlet flow channel 76 extends through the inner wall 72 to the distal end      of the outlet connector 14. </PAR><PAR>  As can be seen best in FIG. 3, the outer wall 70 is generally circular in      shape, and is spaced from and encircles the inner wall 72. The inner wall      is also generally circular in shape, and defines an outlet chamber 78      which is adjacent to and in fluid communication with the outlet flow      channel 76. The inner wall 72 is constructed to have substantially      parallel upper and lower seating surfaces 80, and it effectively forms a      barrier separating the SCD reservoir 74 from the outlet chamber 78. </PAR><PAR>  The outlet housing portion 24b is provided with a pair of spaced,      substantially parallel, flexible and elastic diaphragms 82 which are fixed      about their peripheries adjacent to the outer wall 70. Each diaphragm has      an inner surface which defines the upper and lower limits of the SCD      reservoir 74 and the outlet chamber 78, and an outer surface which forms      an exterior surface of the siphon control device 30. The diaphragms 82 are      situated on opposite sides of the inner wall 72 to position a portion of      each inner surface thereof in contact with an adjacent one of the seating      surfaces 80 and form a seal therebetween which prevents fluid flow between      the outlet occluder port 52 and the outlet flow channel 76. </PAR><PAR>  The outlet housing portion 24b further includes integral offset rings 84      which surround each diaphragm 82 to inhibit overlying tissue from      occluding the siphon control device 30 when implanted into a patient. An      aperture is provided through the housing 24b through which the outlet      connector 14 extends. A fluid tight seal is effected between the housing      outlet aperture and the outlet connector 14 utilizing a tube 64, an over      suture 66 and an adhesive 68, as described above in connection with the      inlet housing portion 24a and the inlet connector 12. </PAR><PAR>  In use, the diaphragms 82 normally lie against and interact with the      seating surfaces 80 of the inner wall 72 to close the device 10 to fluid      flow. The diaphragms 82 move away from the seating surfaces 80, however,      in response to a minimal level of positive fluid pressure within the SCD      reservoir 74 to permit passage of fluid from tee valve housing flow      channel 50 to the outlet flow channel 76 (see FIG. 5). The diaphragms 82      close and seal upon the seating surfaces 80 once again in the absence of      such positive upstream fluid pressure, or in response to negative      downstream hydrostatic pressure in the outlet chamber 78. The siphon      control device 30 thus minimizes the undesirable consequences attendant to      excessive over drainage of fluid due to the siphoning effect of      hydrostatic pressure. </PAR><PAR>  With reference now to the normally closed valves 26 and 28, each valve      includes a valve membrane carrier 86 which is securely positioned within      the valve housing 46 of the second base 22. Each valve membrane carrier 86      provides a cylindrical support for a respective flow control member 88 or      90, and is press-fit within the valve housing 46. </PAR><PAR>  Each of the valve membrane carriers 86 includes a cylindrical outer portion      which abuts against a correspondingly shaped inner surface of the valve      housing 46 to form a fluid tight seal therebetween. A central reinforced      aperture 92 is provided for receiving a portion of the respective flow      control member 88 or 90, and the central aperture 92 is surrounded by      three additional apertures 94 which provide a plurality of channels      through which fluid is permitted to flow. </PAR><PAR>  The valves 26 and 28 are arranged serially within the valve housing 46 for      controlling the flow of cerebrospinal fluid out of a brain ventricle. Each      flow control member 88 and 90 includes a membrane 96, molded of a      synthetic polymer material different from the material of the valve      membrane carrier 86, which is secured relative to the valve membrane      carriers to generally cover the apertures 94. </PAR><PAR>  The resilient membranes 96 are normally biased to close communication      between inlet and outlet sides of each valve 26 and 28, but will open to      permit flow when the pressure on the inlet or proximal side of the      resilient membrane exceeds the pressure on the outlet or distal side by a      predetermined amount. Moreover, should the pressure on the distal side of      either resilient membrane 96 ever exceed the pressure on the proximal      side, tending to cause flow in a reverse direction through the valves 26      and 28, the membrane 96 will seal tightly against a valve seat 98 provided      on the valve membrane carrier 86, to prevent any such reverse fluid flow. </PAR><PAR>  The valve membrane carriers 86 are preferably formed of a polypropylene      material, and the membranes 96 are preferably formed of a silicone      elastomer material. Both polypropylene and elastomer materials have been      shown to produce an acceptable level of tissue reaction, and the use of      this particular duality of materials, in contrast to the use of only a      single material, markedly decreases the chance of the membranes 96      adhering to any portion of the valve membrane carriers 86, which would      clog the drain passage and defeat the purpose of the valves 26 and 28. </PAR><PAR>  An added advantage of using these particular materials is the avoidance of      the negative effect of metal components, due to radiation scatter or      &quot;sunburst effect,&quot; on films taken by, for example, computerized axial      tomography (CAT) scanning equipment. This type of scanning frequently      accompanies the use of surgically implanted flow control valves, and the      absence or limitation of metal in the areas scanned will permit more      accurate and complete results to be gathered from CAT scanning. </PAR><PAR>  The flow control members 88 and 90 each include a rigid nail 100 having an      elongated shaft and an expanded head at an end of the shaft. The nail 100      is capable of being driven into the central aperture 92 of the respective      valve membrane carrier 86 to be frictionally retained therein. The nail      100 is preferably constructed of a polypropylene material which will not      stretch or flex as the nail is being driven into the central aperture 92.      After the nail is properly placed within the aperture, it is preferably      heat welded in place. </PAR><PAR>  The membranes 96 have an arch-shape, as for example a section of a sphere,      and are designed to contact the valve seats 98 generally along the outer      edges of the membrane in a manner surrounding the apertures 94. Each      membrane 96 is secured to its respective valve membrane carrier 86 by the      central support/nail 100. The membrane is retained in place on the nail by      an interference fit or by use of an adhesive, or by any other suitable      means. </PAR><PAR>  Since the valves 26 and 28 are primarily designed to provide controlled      resistance to cerebrospinal fluid flow from a brain ventricle to another      location in the body, it will be appreciated that a doctor must be able to      select valves having the particular pressure/flow characteristics desired      for each individual application. That is, a valve which permits flow at a      relatively low pressure differential may not be suitable where the      maintenance of a higher pressure differential is indicated. Toward this      end, in order to provide a flow control device with a variety of different      pressure/flow characteristics, the first normally closed valve 26 has a      different pressure/flow characteristic than the second normally closed      valve 28. More particularly, the first normally closed valve 26 is      provided with a relatively thick membrane 96, whereas the second normally      closed valve 28 is provided a relatively thin membrane 96. Resistance to      flow increases with an increase in membrane thickness. Thus, the first      normally closed valve provides a higher degree of resistance to flow      through the device 10 than the second normally closed valve 28. </PAR><PAR>  Recognizing that fluid will tend to take the path of least resistance, it      can be seen that fluid permitted to flow through the second fluid conduit      36, thereby bypassing the first normally closed valve 26, will experience      a lesser degree of resistance to flow than if forced to flow through the      first fluid conduit 34. FIGS. 1 through 4 illustrate the configuration of      the flow control device 10 wherein the second fluid conduit 36 is open to      fluid flow therethrough. The inlet housing portion 24a includes a bypass      portion 102 which overlies aligned apertures 104 provided through both the      receptacle 44 and the valve housing 46. As shown best in FIGS. 3 and 4,      fluid is permitted to flow from the flushing reservoir 32 between the      bypass portion 102 and the first base 20, and through the aligned      apertures 104 for introduction on the inlet side of the second normally      closed valve 28. Since both of the normally closed valves 26 and 28      prevent retrograde fluid flow, the fluid passes only through the second      normally closed valve 28 into the valve housing outlet flow channel 50.      Accordingly, resistance to flow through the flow control device 10 when      the second fluid conduit 36 is open, is determined primarily by the second      normally closed valve 28. From the flow channel 50, the fluid then passes      through the siphon control device 30 to the outlet flow channel 76, for      delivery to a distal catheter. </PAR><PAR>  Integrally formed with the bypass portion 102 is a plug 106 configured to      occlude the aligned apertures 104. The receptacle 44 includes a collar 108      designed to retain the plug 106 therein (FIGS. 6 and 7) when inserted by      manual percutaneous pressure applied to the bypass portion 102 of the      housing 24a. With the plug 106 held in place by the collar 108 to occlude      the aligned apertures 104, fluid flow through the second fluid conduit 36      is prevented, thereby requiring any fluid flow through the flow control      device 10 to occur solely through the first fluid conduit 34. </PAR><PAR>  Fluid flow through the first fluid conduit 34 is illustrated best in FIG.      7, which shows that fluid within the flushing reservoir 32 must pass      through both the first and second normally closed valves 26 and 28. Since      the first normally closed valve 26 provides a greater degree of resistance      to flow than the second normally closed valve 28, the first valve 26      primarily determines the resistance to flow of the device 10 in this      configuration. </PAR><PAR>  The design of the flow control device 10, as described above, lends itself      to easy percutaneous distal and proximal flushing, and permits the      selective adjustment of flow characteristics by percutaneous manual      manipulation when subcutaneously implanted. In order to flush the device      10 distally, the inlet occluder wing 56 is pressed downwardly to occlude      the inlet occluder port 40. The dome 58 is then simply pressed downwardly      (FIG. 5) to flush the contents of the flushing reservoir 32 through the      second fluid conduit 36 (or the first fluid conduit 34 if the second fluid      conduit is occluded), past the siphon control device 30 and through the      outlet flow channel 76. Similarly, proximal flushing can be accomplished      by pressing downwardly the offset ring 84 of the siphon control device 30      adjacent to the distal end of the inlet housing portion 24a to occlude the      outlet occluder port 52. The dome 58 is then pressed downwardly to flush      fluid proximally from the flushing reservoir 32 out of the device 10      through the inlet flow channel 38. </PAR><PAR>  In order to dislodge the plug 106 from the collar 108 and thereby open the      second fluid conduit 36, pressure is applied to the housing 24 to occlude      both the inlet occluder port 40 and the outlet occluder port 52, and then      the dome 58 is depressed as if to flush the device 10. However, since both      the distal and proximal flow paths for fluid within the flushing reservoir      32 are occluded, the static fluid pressure between the occluder ports 40      and 52 is raised sufficiently to dislodge the plug 106 from the collar      108. The housing 24 is preferably formed of a resiliently flexible      material so that after dislodging the plug 106 from the collar 108, the      bypass portion 102 of the housing takes on its original shape to permit      fluid flow through the aligned apertures 104 of the second fluid conduit      36. </PAR><PAR>  From the foregoing it is to be appreciated that the present invention      provides a flow control device 10 for use in a subcutaneously implanted      physiological shunt system having selectable alternative means for      controlling fluid flow through the fluid flow path. Through the provision      of a first fluid conduit 34 which directs fluid through both the first and      second normally closed valves 26 and 28, and an alternative second fluid      conduit 36 which bypasses the first normally closed valve 26, means are      provided for permitting fluid flow when upstream fluid pressure exceeds      downstream fluid pressure by two different selected pressure      differentials. The construction of the flow control device 10 of the      present invention permits selective distal and proximal flushing of the      device through the application of manual percutaneous pressure, and      further permits the selected pressure differential to be altered, also      through percutaneous manual manipulation of the device when subcutaneously      implanted. The present invention provides a device by which the flow of      cerebrospinal fluid out of a brain ventricle can be controlled while      preventing the backflow of fluid into the brain ventricle, and inhibits      excessive drainage through the physiological shunt in the presence of      excessive downstream suction. </PAR><PAR>  Although a particular embodiment of the invention has been described in      detail for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made      without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly,      the invention is not to be limited, except as by the appended claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  We claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
