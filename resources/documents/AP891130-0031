The former hard-line leader said the massive dailydemonstrations, and ultimately his downfall, were spurred by anerroneous report that police had killed a student demonstrator.   Jakes, 67, said he opposed the police brutality that sparked themass revolt against his rule. Riot police on Nov. 17 clubbedhundreds of peaceful demonstrators in downtown Prague.   ``There's always some impulse or other'' to popular revolt,Jakes said. ``Here the impulse was the events of Nov. 17. It was atragedy.''   ``We didn't want such an intervention'' by the police, he said,claiming he opposed it along with the Interior Minister, FrantisekKincl. He refused to say who was responsible.   ``Then, the news about the so-called death of a participantelectrified the students and set them in motion. This news provedto be a lie, but the landslide was already moving,'' Jakes saidmatter-of-factly.   On Nov. 18, rumors swept Prague that a mathematics studentidentified as Martin Smid had died when police beat peacefulstudents on a city street.   Dissident Petr Uhl was arrested a day later for putting out thereport, based on the statement of a woman who visited fellowdissident Vaclav Benda and claimed her fiance, Martin Smid, haddied in the violence.   The government frantically tried to shoot down the rumors, evenshowing two men named Martin Smid on television.   Uhl publicly apologized for the false report at a mass rally onSunday, hours after Communist authorities released him from jailunder pressure from the opposition.   By then, the anti-government rallies were attracting hundreds ofthousands of people and events had spun out of the government'scontrol.   Change had been coming anyway, said Jakes, who spoke with threeWestern reporters Wednesday during a break in Parliament, whichamended the constitution to eliminate the Communists' 40-yearmonopoly on power.   ``We were going to create space for democracy. But events movedquicker than we planned, so now we have to take these measuresunder more complicated conditions.''   Jakes, smiling and composed, defended his record as party bosswith the air of a man unable to drink in the momentous changes ofthe past 11 days.   The Communist Party, he said, had planned to introducedemocratic reforms of its own at a December meeting of itspolicy-making Central Committee. But then the mass rallies forcedimmediate leadership changes and concessions.   His claim echoes similar recent claims by many East GermanCommunists that they had always favored change, but were blocked atthe top.   In both countries, citizens who remember four decades of brokenCommunist promises are skeptical of such statements.   Jakes, a Communist steeped in party work for more than fourdecades, seemed unable to believe that the party could lose powerif it goes ahead with the free elections a Politburo member saidWednesday were likely within a year.   The mass demonstrations of recent days ``have concerned only asmall part of the country,'' he said, contradicting a report inTuesday's Communist Party daily Rude Pravo that said ``everylayer'' of society was involved in Monday's general strike calledby the opposition.   Jakes said he favored removing the Communists' leading role fromthe constitution, a key opposition demand.   Enshrining the leading role in the constitution ``damaged ourinterests,'' Jakes said. ``Life has shown that it was not importantwhether the leading role was written down somewhere or not. What isimportant is how we win trust in life.''   Jakes' admission was surprising in the light of his close linksto the crackdown on reform after the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion thatsnuffed out Alexander Dubcek's glorious ``Prague Spring.''   For 21 years, Jakes, President Gustav Husak and other partyleaders resisted the reform they were installed by Moscow tosuppress but which took hold of the Soviet Union after Mikhail S.Gorbachev came to power in 1985.   Jakes denied any responsibility for creating the current crisisin Czechoslovakia, and also said Soviet officials played no role inthe stunning events of the past week.   While sanguine about what he called the damaged prestige of theparty, Jakes signaled the Communists are not going to cave in toall the opposition demands.   The Civic Forum opposition movement has demanded Husak'sresignation by Dec. 10. But Jakes said Civic Forum, as an unelectedbody, cannot usurp this right from Parliament, which under theconstitution appoints the president.   He also opposed Civic Forum demands to disband the party'sparamilitary force.   Jakes, dumped from the ruling Politburo on Friday after the massdemonstrations gathered steam, was asked how he felt about thechants heard against him heard at the pro-democracy rallies.   He sighed and said: ``I have always worked honestly my wholelife, and I worked not for myself, but for society. You can't feelhappy _ but this is what happens in politics.''</TEXT></DOC>
