But the shortagewill be less dire than had once been expected.   The commission now projects that the fund will receive$33.4 million next year, which would be about $3 million morethan had been predicted earlier. The fund gets its money fromtaxpayers' designating that $1 of their federal income-taxpayments go into the fund. For 1990 returns, the checkoffrate was higher than projected, giving way to new optimismfor next year's collections.</LP><TEXT>   Still, the fund is expected to run short, at leasttemporarily, early next year as the Treasury has decided toset aside money for the general election and the politicalconventions before making allowance for early-in-the-yearprimaries. The commission staff estimated that there could bea shortage of $1 million next February and $2.5 million inMarch, compared with the maximum that candidates couldreceive under a statutory formula. (The projections are basedon a comparison with the amount of fund raising in 1984, thelast time an incumbent president was seeking reelection.)   Afterward, the fund will begin growing because ofcheckoffs on income-tax returns for 1991, the commissionsaid, leaving a surplus at the end of next year. However, thenew report still expects the fund to be in deficit in 1996.</TEXT></DOC>
