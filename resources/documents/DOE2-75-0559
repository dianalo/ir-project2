Meanwhile KfK and COSY MicroTec GmbH jointly pursued a detailedstudy to provide for the basis of the construction and to estimate theexpected cost of a synchrotron light source. The results of the studyare described in this report. The results of the study enable KfK toapply for the amount of money necessary to build the synchrotron lightsource.</TEXT></DOC>
