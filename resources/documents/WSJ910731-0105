Naturally, tariffclassification rulings are often disputed with a passion thatwould have made St. Thomas Aquinas proud.   Take tariff classification ruling 89-27(6), which couldhave a major impact on some Americans' social lives. Customsdecreed in 1989 that condoms imported from Mexico that areelectronically tested must carry a higher import tax thancondoms that are not tested. Customs also ruled thatimporters must pay more for condoms that include a spermicidethan they would for condoms without spermicide. (It is notknown whether this decision was part of a secret plan toboost the revenues of family planning clinics.)</LP><TEXT>   The arbitrariness of such customs decisions can devastateimporters and destabilize international trade. Here are a fewmore examples from the Customs casebook:   -- Girls' jackets. The Customs Service in 1988 boosted thetariff on a shipment of 33,000 girls' ski jackets to 27.5%plus 17 cents a pound from 10.6% because the jackets hadsmall strips of corduroy trim on the sleeves. Customs ruledthat the strips, amounting to roughly 2% of the jacket'scomposition, changed the tariff category from &quot;garmentsdesigned for rainwear, hunting, fishing, or similar uses&quot;(such as skiing) to &quot;other girls' wearing apparel, notornamented.&quot;   Famous Raincoat Co., the importer, appealed the Customsruling to the U.S. Court of International Trade. Judge KentonMusgrave observed, &quot;During the trial, government counsel . .. relied on the `philosophical' meaning of the word `or' . .. as opposed to `and.' &quot; The judge threw out the government'scase and ordered Customs to refund the tariff surcharge.   -- Shoes. More than 3,600 of the U.S.'s 8,753 tariffcategories are restricted by import quotas. When Customs'decisions change a product's tariff classification fromunrestricted to restricted, the ruling can effectively banimports. In 1989, a Customs inspector decreed that a box ofathletic shoes could not contain an extra pair ofshoestrings. Shoestring imports are covered by textile importquotas; Customs' decision, by requiring importers to have afederal license to import the extra shoestrings, blocked theimport of tens of thousands of athletic shoes from Asia. Noneof the athletic shoe importers were thinking of the extrashoestrings as anything but part of the athletic shoes, manyof which had eyelets for more than one set of shoestrings.   Customs modified the ruling in 1990, permitting an extrapair of strings as long as the extra shoestrings were lacedinto the athletic shoes and were color coordinated with theshoe. But Customs warned importers, &quot;We note that wheremultiple pairs of laces of like colors and/or designs areimported . . . a presumption is raised&quot; that the shoelacesare not actually part of the shoe.   -- Lingerie. The U.S. government has been drubbed inrepeated court battles for trying to block imports oflingerie and nightgowns by claiming that the lingerie isactually a blouse or long shirt. As the U.S. Association ofImporters of Textiles and Apparel complained in 1988,&quot;Customs resistance to a decision which distinguishednightwear from daywear has left importers in limbo. Importerswho believe they are following the dictates of the Courtcontinue to have merchandise seized as non-complying.&quot;   -- Steel. In the 1980s, the U.S. strong-armed 28 nationsinto signing so-called Voluntary Restraint Agreements (VRAs)to restrict their steel exports. Each VRA specified whichtariff classifications of steel would be restrained. Thoughhappy with the VRAs, the U.S. steel industry was aghast atthe prospect of any freely imported steel remaining andlobbied Customs to solve this problem.   On Dec. 6, 1988, Customs reversed three previous rulingsdating back to 1974 and announced that it was reclassifyingsteel wire rope with beckets from an uncontrolled tariffcategory into a tariff classification restricted by the VRAs.On Aug. 31, 1989, at the behest of Bethlehem Steel, Customsreversed three rulings since 1978 and moved scroll-cuttin-free steel sheet into a restricted tariff classification.   -- Sweeteners. In the early 1980s, Canadian firms wereexporting sugar-corn-sweetener blends to the U.S. Theseblends were 35% cheaper than pure sugar, for which there arequotas. The U.S. government created a separate import quotaand classification for the blended product in 1985. Eventhough the quota limited Canadian sales to 2% of the U.S.market, the imports still gave heartburn to American sugargrowers. In 1988, the Cane Sugar Refiners Associationcontacted its good friend, Sen. Jesse Helms; the NorthCarolina Republican repeatedly called his good friend,Customs Commissioner William von Raab, for sweet talk,according to Greg Rushford of the Legal Times.   In early 1989, the Customs Service redefined sugar andbanned all Canadian blended imports. The first time Canadiancompanies learned of the new sugar definition was when fourtrucks carrying their products were stopped at theU.S.-Canada border and prohibited from entering the U.S. TheCustoms' change in definition devastated an Ohio firm thatrelied on the Canadian blend as its primary product, as Mr.Rushford reported.   The combination of thousands of tariff categories andendless redefinitions of products is turning importing into acrapshoot. Tariff classification disputes are the ultimate&quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; of enlightened `managed trade.' If thegovernment cannot even intelligently decide what an athleticshoe or an item of lingerie is, how likely is it thatgovernment trade restrictions will actually benefit Americaas a nation?   ---   Mr. Bovard is a Cato Institute associate analyst and theauthor of the forthcoming &quot;The Fair Trade Fraud&quot; (St.Martin's Press).</TEXT></DOC>
