Fernandez in Virginia ifcharges filed here were dismissed.   U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. scheduled an Oct. 6hearing on a motion by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh todismiss five criminal charges against Fernandez so that prosecutorscould seek a new indictment from a federal grand jury in nearbyAlexandria, Va.   Lawyers for Fernandez, who is charged with helping direct asecret arms supply network for the Nicaraguan rebels in defiance ofa congressional ban on such aid, urged the judge to dismiss thecase altogether rather than give prosecutors a chance to bringfresh charges.   The dispute stems from Fernandez's refusal to waive his right tobe tried in the Eastern District of Virginia on charges that helied about his role in the arms-supply network to his CIA superiorsand to the presidential commission headed by former Sen. JohnTower, R-Texas, that investigated the Iran-Contra affair.   Four counts of the indictment alleging Fernandez obstructed thecommission's work and made false statements charge the allegedoffenses occurred at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va.   The conspiracy charge, which is the fifth count of theindictment, alleges that Fernandez, former National SecurityCouncil aide Oliver North and arms dealer Richard V. Secord,operated an illegal arms supply network. Part of the conspiracyoccurred in Washington, according to the indictment.   Last week, Fernandez moved to dismiss the four other chargesbecause the federal court in Washington lacked jurisdiction overthem.   Rather than face the prospect of two trials, Walsh askedRobinson for permission to dismiss all five charges againstFernandez so that he could seek a new indictment from a federalgrand jury in Alexandria.   Defense attorney Thomas E. Wilson argued in court papers earlierthis week that prosecutors should not be allowed to bring the casein Virginia because they already have been given a preview ofFernandez's defense in motions filed before Robinson.</TEXT></DOC>
