Background </ITAG>Under section 410(a) of the Copyright Act of 1976, title 17 of the UnitedStates Code, the Register of Copyrights determines whether the materialsubmitted for registration ``constitutes copyrightable subject matter andthat other legal and formal requirements have been met'' before issuinga certificate of registration. To be registrable and copyrightable, a work must constitute an ``originalwork of authorship.'' 17 U.S.C. 102. Useful articles are not protectedexcept to the extent the articles contain artistic features capable ofexisting separately and independently of the overall utilitarian shape.Variations of typographic ornamentation [or] ``mere lettering'' are notcopyrightable. 37 CFR 202.1(a). In <T3>Eltra Corp. v. Ringer, </T3>579 F.2d 294 (4th Cir. 1978), the FourthCircuit upheld the Office's refusal to register a claim to copyright intypeface design under its then regulation, 37 CFR 202.10(c)(1978) [nowcodified in the Copyright Act in the definition of ``pictorial, graphic,or sculptural works'']. The <T3>Eltra </T3>court reasoned that ``it is patent that typeface is an industrialdesign in which the design cannot exist independently and separately asa work of art.'' 579 F.2d at 298. The decision in <T3>Eltra Corp. v. Ringer </T3>clearly comports with the intention of theCongress. Whether typeface designs should be protected by copyright wasconsidered and specifically rejected by Congress in passing the CopyrightAct of 1976. The 1976 House Report states:<ITAG tagnum="21">A ``typeface'' can be defined as a set of letters, numbers, or othersymbolic characters, whose forms are related by repeating design elementsconsistently applied in a notational system and are intended to be embodiedin articles whose intrinsic utilitarian function is for use in composingtext or other cognizable combinations of characters. The Committee doesnot regard the design of typeface, as thus defined, to be a copyrightable``pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work'' within the meaning of this billand the application of the dividing line in section 101. [H.R. Rep. No.1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 55 (1976)].</ITAG>In rejecting copyright protection for typeface designs, the Congress inaddition deferred a decision on a more limited form of protection underproposed ornamental design legislation. Title II of the 1976 copyrightrevision bill as passed by the Senate could have protected typeface designs,but the House of Representatives had doubts about even this limited formof protection. Consequently, only copyright revision passed. H.R. Rep.No. 1476 at 50 and 55. Design legislation has yet to be enacted, and Congresshas chosen not to include typeface designs within the Copyright Act's definitionof pictorial, graphic or sculptural works. The Copyright Office has received applications to register claims to copyrightin material variously termed ``data,'' ``database,'' ``computer program,''``compilation of data,'' and ``typefont data set,'' which relate to, orrepresent, digitized versions of typeface designs. A Notice of Inquirywas published in October 1986 requesting public comment regarding the registrabilityof this material. ((51 FR 36410 (Oct. 10, 1986)). The Notice raised primarilyfour questions about the nature and extent of any copyrightable authorshipin digitized typography, apart from the typeface design itself: whetherthere exist a variety of ways to express instructions for creating thesame typeface design; are there any copyrightable elements, apart fromthe unprotectible typeface design, which comprise the ``original work ofauthorship;'' does the ``information,'' ``instructions,'' or ``data'' comprisea computer program, compilation or database; and, finally, if registrationis permitted, what would be the appropriate form of deposit? The comment period was extended twice (52 FR 3146 and 52 FR 23476) to allowfull public comment. A total of 19 initial and reply comments were received,including a videotape demonstration of the digitization process and otherexhibits. <ITAG tagnum="84">2. Technology and the Digitizing Process </ITAG>In describing the process of the digitization of typefont characters, theOffice will employ technical terms, for which we adopt the following definitions.``Digital typefont'' is a bitmapped digital representation of an actualanalog typeface design, stored in binary form on magnetic or optical media,or Read-Only-Memory (ROM) mounted on a circuit board. Sometimes, the ROMon the circuit board is assembled into a plastic cartridge which is insertedinto a laser printer or other microprocessor-driven device. When decodedand interpreted, by the ``bitmapping code'' software, the digital representationof the design will reproduce the appropriate character. ``Bitmapping''refers to the technology that allows control of individual pixels on adisplay screen to produce graphic elements of superior resolution, permittingaccurate reproduction of arcs, circles, sine waves, or other curved images.A ``bitmapped character,'' whether used on a computer screen or on a dot-matrixor laser printer, is a dotted representation of an analog letter or characterimage where dots are so close together that when reduced to actual printedor displayed size, they form an image or character without the need toconnect the dots.To create a digitized typeface from an existing analog typeface, analogvisual representations of characters are scanned and represented as a collectionof discrete picture elements, called pixels. Pixels can be efficientlyencoded in digital form on any convenient storage medium. The medium canbe magnetic (e.g. tape, disk or diskette), electronic (e.g., ROM cartridge),or optical (e.g., video-disk). The encoded digitized representation isthen organized as bits of information, manipulated and changed (usuallyreduced to minimize storage requirements) and placed in a format usablewith a specific program and compatible digital typesetter.  Typically, a specialized computer circuit in the printing device readsthe information from the storage media or cartridge and causes a laserbeam to draw a representation of a particular typefont character on a cylindricalsurface in direct response to the digital data and instructions in themedia or cartridge. This image is then transferred by a process, similarto printing, to paper from which the information is read or the printermay drive a set of wires against an inked ribbon that places dots on thepaper. The visual representation appears once again.   There are basically three techniques applied to represent characters digitally:Bitmapping, outlining and stroke definition. A digitized typeface couldbe prepared by bitmapping alone, but it is more common to use a combinationof the three techniques to improve the quality of the typeface.  Bitmapping is a dot-by-dot representation of each character. A differentbitmap is required for each size and style of a character, and there areseveral ways to create a bitmap. The most popular ways are by scanningblack and white images, scan converting a digital outline representation(soft scanning) using software written for this purpose, building up animage bit-by-bit using an interactive editor on a computer, and througha combination of scanning and editing.  In the outline method, lines or curves define the boundaries of typefacecharacters. The outlines can consist of straight line segments only orstraight line segments along with abstract representations of the curves.The digital information, comprised of instructions and data, is fixed bya computer operator who digitally locates only the outlines of characters.In order to form a completed letter on a screen display or on paper whenprinted out, an outline font program instructs a computer or printer logicto fill in the outline of the character. If a laser printer is used, thebeam sweeps from side to side or up and down within the boundaries of theletter, filling in the bounded area with dots that will show up as solidson the paper or screen.  In the stroked definition method, characters are represented like the ``strokes''of a pen or brush following the path of a straight or curved line. Thecomputer operator must define the characteristics of the ``pen'' or ``brush,''such as what occurs at corners and stroke endings. Ultimately, these descriptionsmust be converted into bitmaps.  Finally, digitization techniques may be used to create a new typeface_onethat has no prior analog counterpart.  <ITAG tagnum="84">3. Summary of Comments  </ITAG>The Copyright Office received 19 initial and reply comments in responseto its Notice.  Two comments maintain that the digitized typefaces are not copyrightable.The first argues that the only difference between the digitized versionand the unprotectible typeface itself is that the former is ``read'' bya machine to create the visually perceptible typeface. The ``look-up''table in a bitmap, this comment continues, is a one-on-one correlationwhich involves no creativity. The algorithms used in the outline methodlikewise involve <T3>de minimis</T3> judgment and creativity. Finally, the commentator cautionsthat protection of digitized versions of typeface may inhibit the standardizationof character matrixes that facilitate the compatibility of software forpersonal computers.  The second comment opposing registration declares that bitmaps are staticdata, fixed representations of images at a given resolution. This commentcompares the static dot pattern representation of each letter to the patternscast and carved onto metal in medieval times.  In support of registration, eleven comments espouse variations of the basicproposition that the data and instructions which comprise the digital typefontare computer programs, copyrightable databases or some protectible hybridof the two. The themes which run through their various comments are thatthe data and instructions are a ``work'' apart from the typeface itself,the ``work'' is ``used directly or indirectly in a computer to bring abouta certain result'' and qualifies as a computer program within the meaningof section 101 of title 17, and/or the ultimate shape of the typefont characterdoes not predetermine its digital representation and elements of humanselection and arrangement are required, constituting a protectible database. One comment states that the ``work'' is a computer program which operateson a data stream and is configured in a particular format. Another amplifiesthis position, explaining that execution of the program calls up storeddata in the form of digitized typeface instructions and converts the instructionsinto printed typeface characters.  Two comments take the position that the ``rule of doubt'' should be used.The first argues that digitized databases are both databases and programs,and, since neither can be read by the Office, ultimately the courts shoulddecide on their copyrightability. This comment advocates that, in any event,the ``work'' is protectible as a program, compilation or separately asa literary work. Another comment claims protection for the edited, compiledset of instructions and data as a literary work. The second comment espousingrule of doubt would limit the registration to the typeface database.  Several comments state that not all typeface programs and databases areprotectible. Purely mechanical translations from analog to digitized typefaces,they acknowledge, are not copyrightible. For example, they state that protectionshould not be extended where an analog typefont is merely scanned intodigital form with no editing or selection of font characteristics, or wherethere is mere duplication of preexisting digital typefont without furtherediting.  One comment recommends considering typefont a special class of program.Another one opines that the protectible work is a digital photograph. Copyrightable expression attaches, another comment contends, in that programmingchoices exist apart from the functional data and algorithms utilized inthe program expressing the typeface design.One comment recommends protecting the typefont as a software/database hybrid.The ``work'' is the integration of all elements of the software and database.The software should be protected separately also, this comment continues,because it is a different work then the typeface, and programs are protectible,it is argued, even if they ultimately produce an uncopyrightable end product.Another comment describes the choices inherent in font digitization, andargues that the combination of data and instructions statisfies the CopyrightAct's definition of the term ``computer program.'' The digital image, itmaintains, can be represented in different computer languages using differenttechniques. This comment also states that no distinction is drawn at themachine language level between data and instructions. In general purposeprogramming languages, the surface separation between data and algorithmsis for the ease of human programmers. Programs are like sentences: Algorithms(verbs) act upon data (nouns). In some languages, data and algorithms aretightly bound in a single program. In others, the data and algorithms areinitially stored separarely, though they must be conjoined in order forthe computer to successfully execute the instructions for rendering digitaltype. This comment further argues that the conversion from analog to digitalis not an automatic computer process_ different printers read differentcomputer languages and this must be factored into the translation; thetranslation is a derivative work.Another comment states that programs to generate typeface design can bewritten in various languages and for many different machines with distinctprograms. Typeface programs, it is argued, are original and creative andshould be protected.<ITAG tagnum="84">4. Policy Decision and Rationale</ITAG>The proponents of copyright registration for data or other elements relatedto digitized typefaces seek, as they must, to present arguments for protectionof data, or program instructions, or hybrid works consisting of both dataand instructions that are entitled to copyright apart from the uncopyrightabletypeface designs and typefonts. Both the Congress and the Fourth CircuitCourt of Appeals in <T3>Eltra Corp. v. Ringer </T3>decided that analog typeface designs arenot now copyright subject matter. The Copyright Office concludes that typefacescreated by a computerized-digital process are also uncopyrightable. Likeanalog typefaces, digitally created typefaces exhibit no creative authorshipapart from the utilitarian shapes that are formed to compose letters orother font characters.Congress has not only rejected copyright protection for typeface designs.It has refused to enact a more limited form of protection, the proposed``design protection law,'' which might be a vehicle for typeface designprotection.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Senate design bill, S. 791, would specifically protecttypeface designs. The House bills (H.R. 379; H.R. 1179; H.R. 1603) omitspecific reference to typeface, but the definitions of the bills probablyinclude typeface protection.In making this decision on registration for digitized versions of typefaces,the Copyright Office has been conscious of the need for caution to avoida decision that would undermine the clear congressional and judicial findingsthat typeface designs are not copyright subject matter. Moreover, a typefontis not copyrightable since it constitutes the useful article itself.The issue then is whether the process of computer assisted digitizationof uncopyrightable typeface designs and typefonts creates compilationsof data or computer program instructions that are copyrightable and separatefrom the uncopyrightable elements. We conclude that computer programs usedto control the general digitization process and that otherwise meet thestandards for protection are registrable notwithstanding their use in generatingunprotectible typefonts, but the claim to copyright must exclude any datathat merely depicts the typeface or letterforms.Although most comments favored protection of the data/instructions actuallydepiciting particular digital typefonts, our analysis of the copyrightstatute and relevant judicial precedent, as well as the arguments of thecomments that opposed registration (and even the comments of some of thosesupporting registration of some elements), convinces us that any data thatmerely transforms an analog visual representation of a typeface or letterforminto a digital electronic typefont or letterform is not protectible asa work of authorship.The Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. 101 <T3>et. seq.</T3> (1976), defines the term compilation as ``a work formedby the collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data thatare selected, coordinated, or arranged in such a way that the resultingwork as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship.'' 17 U.S.C.101. To be an original work of authorship, a compilation must include subjectiveelements of human selection and arrangement. <T3>Financial Information, Inc. v. Moody's Investor Service, Inc., </T3>808F.2d 204, 206-08 (2d Cir. 1986), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>108 S.Ct. 79 (1987). Because the typefont data isdetermined by the ultimate shape of the typeface character, and requires<T3>de minimis, </T3>if any, selection and arrangement, it does not qualifyas a compilation or any other original work of authorship.Proponents of registration argued that the data representing a digitizedtypeface should be copyrightable because, after the initial rendering ofthe letterform into electronic digital form, there is selection, coordination,or arrangement of data/instructions in order to generate an acceptable,final typeface image. One commentator drew an analogy to ``connect-the-dots''or ``fill-in-the-blanks'' illustrations in children's books. The analogyis unpersuasive. A ``connect-the-dots'' illustration is copyrightable onlyif the ``connected'' illustration is a copyrightable pictorial or graphicwork. In the case of typeface ``connect-the-dots,'' the ``connected'' illustrationis an uncopyrightable typeface, and the connecting process is indistinguishablefrom the creation of the typeface design itself.Proponents also argued that the data representing a digitized typefaceis copyrightable even though the end result_a typeface or typefont_is uncopyrightable.By analogy to a cookbook, they argued that the explanation and illustrationof recipes is copyrightable even though the end result_the food product_isnot. The Copyright Office agrees, of course, that original explanationsand illustrations in cookbooks are copyrightable. But neither lists ofingredients nor the method of preparing the food product is copyrightable.The Copyright Office finds that digitized typeface data is more like anuncopyrightable list of ingredients than a copyrightable explanation orillustration of a process.Before the advent of digitized typeface technology, arguments were madethat, in creating new typeface designs, artists expended thousands of hoursof effort in preparing by hand the drawings of letters and characters thatultimately would lead to the creation of an original typeface design. Afterseveral years of consideration and a public hearing, the Copyright Officefound that this effort did not result in a work of authorship. The Officerefused to register claims in typeface designs or in the drawings of theletters and typefont characters because the design choices were responsiveto the functional characteristics of typefonts used in high-speed printing.That is, no work of authorship existed separate from the utilitarian aspectsof typefonts and letterforms. That decision was upheld in <T3>Eltra Corp. v. Ringer.</T3>Under earlier technology, typeface designs were fixed in wood blocks, incold metal, or in film fonts. With computer-digital technology, the typefaceis fixed in an electronic font. The Copyright Office finds that no workof authorship is created by the process that fixes or depicts a particulartypeface in a digital electronic form. Like analog typeface design, thedesign choices or any selection of data involved in the bitmapping, outlining,and stroke definition techniques are limited by the objective of renderingor fixing the uncopyrightable electronic font. This finding applies bothto the initial scanning of the letterforms and to the subsequent refiningof the typeface by ``curving,'' ``connect-the-dots,'' and other techniques.The data created is an electronic depiction of the typeface. In fact, thereare fewer authorship choices involved in transforming an existing analogtypeface to an electronic font than in using the digitization process tocreate a new typeface design. Yet clearly the typeface design and the processof creating it are uncopyrightable whether the process is digital or analog.The use of the computer in this process neither diminishes nor adds tothe factors that determine copyrightability.The Copyright Office observes that more digitization of even a pre-existingcopyrightable work does not result in a new work of authorship. The digitizedversion is a copy of the pre-existing work and would be protected as such,but no new work of authorship is created. A novel may be digitized andstored in an electronic medium. Protection depends on the status of copyrightin the novel; digitization does not add any new authorship.Although the master computer program used to control the generic digitizationprocess is protectible and may be registered, if original, this protectiondoes not extend to the data fixing or depicting a particular typeface ortypefont or to any algorithms created as an alternative means of fixingthe data. The Office will register a program that can be used to createdigitized versions of various typefaces but will not register the dataused to depict a particular typeface or individual letterforms. If thecomputer program submitted for registration includes data that fixes ordepicts a particular typeface, typefont, or letterform, the Office requiresan appropriate disclaimer of copyright on the application to exclude theuncopyrightable data.The Copyright Office in this decision has been conscious of the interestsof typeface developers and the interests of typeface users, who, in accordancewith a congressional decision not to protect typefaces, are entitled tocopy this uncopyrightable subject matter. While copyright protection isnot available for digitized versions of typefaces, the typeface industryhas other avenues of protection through unfair competition laws, contract,and perhaps trade secrecy and trademark protection.On the other hand, the congressional decision not to protect typeface designs,in addition to adhering to traditional standards of original authorship,reflects a concern about inappropriate protection of the vehicles for reproducingthe printed word. If copyright protection existed for the data representinga particular typeface design, a printer who innocently used an infringingelectronic typefont to print a public domain book would presumably infringethe copyright in the data fixed in the electronic font. The Copyright Officeis persuaded that this result would undermine the congressional policyagainst protection for typeface designs.The Office therefore concludes that, if copyright protection for the mastercomputer program alone is not adequate to encourage creativity in the fieldof computer-assisted typeface design, any broader protection, if appropriate,should be legislated by Congress rather than established by administrativedecision-making. Congress is the appropriate forum for debating the concernsthat infect the question of legal protection for typeface designs or digitizedrepresentations of typefaces. Congress can legislate limitations on thescope of protection, including any appropriate exemptions for printersor other secondary, ``innocent infringers.''<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 13, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Ralph Oman,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Register of Copyrights.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Approved by:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James H.
