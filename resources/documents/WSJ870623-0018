The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 24.66 to 2445.51, its third consecutive record close. The industrial average started to climb right from the opening bell, with the stage set by advances in the dollar and Treasury bond prices in Tokyo and European trading early yesterday.    The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 2.68 to 309.65, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index moved up 1.24 to 173.77 -- both indexes finished at records.    There is a feeling among investors &quot;that the dollar has stabilized and the old bugaboo of inflation won't rear its ugly head for a while,&quot; said Dick Kehne, a managing director in the equity trading department at S.G. Warburg.    Adding to the stock market's strength was a sharp decline in commodity prices. The Commodity Research Bureau's futures-price index slid 6.46 to 223.06.    Some buying by foreign investors also contributed to the higher opening, but foreigners typically aren't big buyers on Mondays. Some traders said buy programs tied to investment strategies using stock-index futures and options added to some of the demand for stocks.    &quot;This continues to be a market that surprises people on the upside,&quot; said Laszlo Birinyi, a market analyst with Salomon Brothers in New York. He believes that money managers might be surprised with the market's climb from its low in late May. But they might also feel compelled to spend some of the cash accumulated in their portfolios before the end of the quarter, when they must present their quarterly performance reports to clients, he added.    Mr. Birinyi noted that among yesterday's advancers were such high-priced issues as International Business Machines, Merck, Du Pont and Digital Equipment. &quot;These are the kinds of stocks where you can spend some money quickly,&quot; he said.    But traders said they didn't see much aggressive buying demand from their money manager clients. One trader said money managers might be reluctant to pay the current high prices for stocks.    Blue-chips, such as the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, &quot;are leading the advance as we move into the end of the quarter,&quot; said Steven Kroll, chief investment officer for Hutton Asset Management. He noted that these stocks had been pulling the market for the last four weeks, and he is ready to take some profits in these issues now and invest the cash in such issues as airlines and thrifts, which have lagged.    Volume on the Big Board fell to 178.2 million shares from 220.5 million shares Friday. Despite the advances in the stock indexes, gainers didn't have an overwhelming lead over losers on the Big Board, with 907 issues up and 692 down.    Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing gained 2 1/2 to 71 1/2. The company said it expects higher sales and earnings for the second quarter and for the full year. The company earned $1.72 a share in the 1986 second quarter, and it earned $6.80 a share in 1986. The company cited a weaker dollar as one of the reasons for the better results.    Gold and other mining stocks tumbled as precious metals and other commodity prices had big setbacks. ASA fell 2 1/8 to 55 1/8, Campbell Red Lake lost 1 7/8 to 23 1/2, Echo Bay Mines dropped 2 3/8 to 32 3/4, Hecla Mining declined 3/4 to 17 1/8, Homestake Mining sank 1 3/8 to 32 3/4, Phelps Dodge fell 1 1/8 to 34 3/4, Newmont Mining lost 1 3/8 to 44 1/8 and Asarco eased 3/8 to 23.    Crude oil prices declined along with other commodity prices, and some oil stocks had small gains.    Allegis closed up 1/8 at 90 3/8 in moderately active trading. Marriott said it &quot;is not currently involved&quot; in any negotiations regarding the buyout of Allegis or any part of the giant travel concern.    There were rumors late last week that Marriott and the Pritzker family of Chicago, both of which already have extensive hotel interests, were considering a joint buyout of Allegis.    Financial Corp. of America tumbled 1 to 5 1/2 on volume of 932,400 shares. The stock was the biggest percentage loser on the Big Board. An article in yesterday's Wall Street Journal said that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board search for a buyer for the troubled company is centering on proposals by Ford Motor and an investor group led by former Treasury Secretary William E. Simon. Ford inched up 1/8 to 96 1/4.    Gillette lost 1/2 to 39 1/4 in active trading. Last week Gillette rejected a $40.50-a-share takeover offer from Revlon Group. Gillette shareholders yesterday filed a suit in federal court in Boston asking for a preliminary injunction that would prevent Gillette from enforcing a standstill agreement between the company and Revlon.    Korea Fund rose 5 1/8 to 61 1/4 on heavy volume of 245,900 shares. The shares of this closed-end investment fund had dropped last week on worries about the student protests and political unrest in South Korea. Seoul apparently is offering some concessions aimed at quelling the protests.    ACCO World jumped 4 7/8 to 28 3/8. The office-supply company agreed to be acquired by American Brands at $29 a share. American Brands eased 3/8 to 46 7/8.    Dayton Hudson sank 2 1/2 to 54 on trading of more than 2.2 million shares. The Minneapolis-based retailer confirmed that Dart Group has a stake in the company, but Dayton Hudson said it isn't interested in being acquired. As part of a defensive effort, it has asked Minnesota to bolster its takeover laws.    Imperial Chemical Industries moved up 2 1/4 to 95. Imperial has agreed to sell the specialty chemicals business of Stauffer Chemical to Akzo America, a unit of a Dutch chemical company, Akzo N.V., for $625 million. Imperial bought Stauffer from Unilever earlier this month for $1.7 billion.    Diamond-Bathurst rose 1 5/8 to 21 7/8 in active trading. The company said it was in the midst of preliminary talks with several parties regarding various merger possibilities.    JWT Group inched up 3/4 to 52 3/4. Bear Stearns said it holds a 7.33% stake for itself and for some of its clients in JWT, acquired as part of its business as a broker-dealer. JWT Chairman Don Johnston said the company wasn't prepared to respond to WPP Group's proposal to increase its offer to acquire JWT to $50.50 a share by noon EDT yesterday.    The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that JWT was meeting with at least three companies about taking the advertising concern private.    General Dynamics rose 1 3/4 to 68. The aerospace concern was cleared of fraud charges involving the Sgt. York antiaircraft gun. </TEXT></DOC>
