The services, which the regional Bell phone company willoffer starting next year, are aimed at businesses that wantto move data, graphics and video images between facilities.Companies have been scrambling to transfer such data faster,to help link together their far-flung networks of personalcomputers, mainframes and teleconference rooms.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Our customers are expecting these services from us,&quot; saidRobert G. Meldrum, marketing communications director for U SWest Communications, the unit that will direct the newbusiness. &quot;This is the direction they're moving, and we needto follow.&quot;   And quickly, analysts say. That's because a host oftelecommunications concerns, by building high-speed privatelines that sidestep the public networks, have begun tothreaten the dominance over data transmission that big phonecompanies like U S West have long held. Indeed, yesterdayBritish Telecom North America, a unit of BritishTelecommunications PLC, unveiled an international datatransmission service linking 160 U.S. cities and points inEurope.   &quot;The Baby Bells want to protect their market share and winback some of the share they've lost to private networkvendors,&quot; said Susan B. Kalla, vice president at LinkResources Corp., a New Yorkbased research firm.   U S West's move also comes at a time when many bigcorporate customers are turning back to public data networks-- and the major phone companies that operate them -- to helptrim the high costs that internal, custom-built networks canentail, Ms. Kalla said.   U S West, Engelwood, Colo., plans to spend $75 million onits new Advanced Communications Services business by the endof 1992, and the remainder of the $300 million over the nextfour years. The money will be used for research, marketing,equipment, software and sales and support staff training. Theservices will eventually be available in 14 western stateswhere U S West operates.   U S West wouldn't project revenues or a specific timetablefor recovering its investment. But Mr. Meldrum said thecompany's business plan called for recouping its expenses&quot;much faster than in five years.&quot;   The first products are expected by next June, Mr. Meldrumsaid. They will include a high-speed digital service known asSwitched Multimegabit Data Service and an efficient form oftransmission known as Frame Relay, as well as a variety oftechnologies designed to link so-called LANs, the local areanetworks that tie together office computers.   While every phone company is expanding its datatransmission enterprises, not all are taking the sameapproach -- or investing as heavily -- as U S West.Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., a unit of St. Louis-basedSouthwestern Bell Corp., is spending $50 million to $100million over the next seven years to build several high-speedfiber-optic data rings in its service areas. But its networkwon't be as extensive as the one U S West plans.</TEXT></DOC>
