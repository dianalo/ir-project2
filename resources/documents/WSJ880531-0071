The venture pools GPA's existing order for two MD-11s and options for two more with an existing order for three MD-11s and six options placed by British Caledonian Airways -- now part of British Airways. Though this total of 13 airplanes is small, &quot;We look at this fleet as phase one,&quot; James M. King, GPA's executive vice president for operations, said. &quot;It is expected that we'll buy more.&quot;    The leasing venture is 50%-owned by GPA, based in Shannon, Ireland; 25% by British Airways; and 25% by St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas, which has an aircraft division in Long Beach, Calif. The new company is comparable to a four-year-old joint venture of GPA, McDonnell Douglas and Mitsui andamp; Co. of Japan that buys and leases McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft.    The formation of the MD-11 venture means different things to the three participants. For British Airways, it is a way of postponing delivery of the MD-11s ordered by British Caledonian without giving up the airplanes. British Airways, which needs to replace its fleet of Lockheed Corp. L-1011s and British Caledonian's McDonnell Douglas DC-10s, may well choose MD-11s, but sources said the carrier isn't yet ready to make that decision.    With the first MD-11 scheduled for delivery next March, British Airways was facing a quick decision. Leasing the long-haul, wide-body planes allows British Airways to assess more carefully the alternatives, which include the A-340 model of Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft consortium.    For McDonnell Douglas, the leasing venture &quot;helps us keep BA (British Airways) in the fold,&quot; said Edmund Rug, U.K. marketing director for the U.S. company. &quot;We want BA very badly. We haven't sold them anything for 30 years.&quot;    McDonnell Douglas has run into some difficulties in selling the 280-seat, three-engine successor to the DC-10. Scandinavian Airlines System and Hong Kong-based Dragonair both reneged on early orders, and the aircraft's sales momentum has stalled of late. Airbus is giving it rough competition with its range of wide-body planes, and Seattle-based Boeing Co. is stealing business with its 767 model.    Mr. Rug said British Airways is under heavy pressure from its government, British Aerospace PLC and Rolls-Royce PLC to buy Airbus planes. British Aerospace is a 20% shareholder in the Airbus consortium; the government subsidizes Airbus projects; and Rolls-Royce, an aircraft engines maker, is trying to upgrade an existing engine so that it could power the A-340. British Airways is a big Rolls-Royce customer and would find an A-340 powered by Rolls engines attractive.    GPA, which already has 113 aircraft valued at $1.7 billion in its leasing portfolio, simply wants to have the planes that airlines want to lease. Mr. King, the executive vice president, said that traffic growth projections, expecially for the Pacific, indicate that wide-body planes will be in demand in the future. Most of GPA's planes now are narrow-body, twin-engine aircraft.    GPA, a closely held company with shareholders that include airlines and financial institutions in Europe, North America and Japan, has 224 new aircraft on order and options for another 110. The company has a joint venture with Airbus and others that buys and leases Airbus A-320s, and a venture with a Canadian carrier that buys and leases a variety of commuter aircraft. </TEXT></DOC>
