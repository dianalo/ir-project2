For instance, U.S. companieslocked in survival battles with Asian competitors aren'trushing to sign up managers of Asian descent to investemployees' pension money, pension-fund watchers say.   Nor are women universally seen as deserving specialtreatment. A black money manager complains that givingbusiness to a firm owned by a woman would be of little socialutility if, for example, her son were to inherit thebusiness. &quot;My son will still be black,&quot; he says.   Suspicious of &quot;fronts,&quot; most pension funds require womenor minorities to own at least 51% of a firm if it is toqualify for special hiring consideration. But that doesn'tensure minorities will benefit the most in joint-ownershiparrangements.   &quot;The non-minorities are using this as a loophole toattract more business,&quot; money manager Lawrence Cisneros saysof many joint ventures.   Just how complicated the search for minority managers canbe is illustrated by the competition staged last year by theCalifornia Public Employees Retirement System. Despiteapplications from 85 firms, many of them owned by blacks,trustees were dismayed that the staff-selected finalistsdidn't include any black-owned firms.   There was further distress because although severalHispanic money managers were among the finalists, none wereof Mexican descent -- a significant consideration inCalifornia.   The competition was reconsidered, and the 12 managerswinning accounts included both black-owned andMexican-American firms.   Mindful of possible charges of reverse discrimination, theCalifornia search also invited applications from any&quot;emerging&quot; firm with less than $500 million under management.Among applicants was: Nikko Capital Management (USA) Inc., anaffiliate of Japan's Nikko Securities Co., one of the world'sbiggest brokerage firms. Nikko Capital met the size testbecause it managed just $288 million in assets.   It wasn't chosen.
