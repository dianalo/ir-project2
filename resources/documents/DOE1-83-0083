<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-83-0083 </DOCNO><TEXT>We report on tunneling between the two-dimensional electron inversionlayer on a degenerate p-InAs substrate and the three-dimensional bulkvalence states in Yb/oxide/InAs tunnel junctions. The current-voltagecharacteristics show negative differential conductance with current peak-to-valleyratio up to 2.7 (17) at T = 300 K (77 K). The inversion layer is inducedby the high electric surface field that arises from the low work functionof the Yb electrode. Tunneling across the oxide provides a low-resistivecontact of the metal to the electron layer.</TEXT></DOC>
