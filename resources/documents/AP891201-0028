SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The CIA has reported that some seniorPhilippine officials are worried that entire segments of theirarmed forces supposedly loyal to President Corazon Aquino will failto ``fight effectively'' in fending off the rebels attempting totopple her government, an administration source said today.   The Central Intelligence Agency, in its daily intellgencesummary prepared for top U.S. officials, reported that thesituation in the Philippines remains ``quite uncertain,'' said theofficial, speaking on condition he not be identified by name.   ``It's all very gauzy stuff,'' said the source, who added thatthe assessment was open to change given the fluid situation on theground in the Philippines.   The report came as Rear Adm. Edward D. Sheafer, a DefenseIntelligence Agency official, told reporters at a Pentagon briefing:   ``We're cautiously optimistic based upon reports we have fromthe Philippine government that the government forces seem to beprevailing.''   Sheafer, went asked how much support the rebel forces hadoutside Manila, said, ``It's difficult to judge how well it'sorganized.'' He added that recent reports indicate the NPA _ thecommunists _ were not playing an active role in the rebellion.   The dual reports came just hours after President Bush orderedU.S. fighters into action to provide air cover for two Philippineair bases and help defend the Aquino government against a coupattempt.   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams, who joined Sheafer at thebriefing, said, ``no U.S. planes have fired any shots orintercepted any rebel aircraft.''   The administration source said that the CIA relayed anassessment during the early morning hours to Washington that wasbased on the judgments of some senior Philippine officials.   The report ``questioned whether the Philippine military ... willfight effectively'' on Mrs. Aquino's behalf because of low moraleamong the troops, the source said.   The official said the assessment did not detail exactly howwidespread the discontent might be in the Philippine military, butthat it did note that the loyalty of the Marine Corps, inparticular, ``is in question.''   Besides unrest within the military, public discontent with theAquino government has been growing because of rising prices, ashortage of electricity and allegations of corruption.   The administration source said the CIA analysis also mademention of other areas of unrest in the Philippines.   The report said that U.S. Embassy officials in Manila hadreported to the State Department that they had been informed bysenior Philippine military officials that the Mactan air base atCebu in the south had ``gone over to the rebels,'' the source said.   The report to the State Department also noted that Gov. RudolfoAguinaldo of Cagayan province ``is supporting the coup,'' thesource said.   In a radio interview, the governor has stated that soldiers inhis northern Luzon area supported the mutiny and ``we are bringingin artillery and armor.''</TEXT></DOC>
