Grossman, of insider-trading charges related to his family's trading in Colt Industries Inc. stock options.    After a two-week trial -- the first criminal insider-trading case in two years that the government had to prove in court -- and three hours of deliberations, the jury yesterday convicted the 34-year-old Mr. Grossman of all 38 felony counts of securities fraud and mail fraud.    U.S. District Judge Richard Owen could sentence Mr. Grossman to a maximum 190 years in prison and fine him almost $10 million.    The judge set sentencing for Sept. 15. Prosecutors said they will urge a prison term be given by Judge Owen, who is regarded as one of the court's toughest-sentencing judges. The longest prison sentence given in a U.S. insider-trading case was four years.    Mr. Grossman was ordered jailed after prosecutors said there was a risk he would flee the country.    Mr. Grossman had been an associate at the Manhattan law firm of Kramer, Levin, Nessen, Kamin andamp; Frankel. Mr. Grossman's attorney, Irving P. Seidman, said his client would appeal &quot;and committed no crime cognizable under our laws.&quot;    The verdict is a boost for U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, who only lately has been facing court challenges from insider-trading defendants, after a string of guilty pleas starting last year with Dennis B. Levine. The chief of Mr. Giuliani's criminal division personally prosecuted the case.    Mr. Giuliani said afterward that the verdict showed it was &quot;silly&quot; to think that insider-trading cases are too difficult to prove before a jury.    Mr. Grossman, of Brooklyn, N.Y., had been arrested in February and was charged with leaking nonpublic information from his law firm about a planned Colt recapitalization. The government charged that the data helped him, five relatives and a friend of one relative reap a total profit of almost $1.5 million on an investment in certain high-risk Colt call options of $33,938. Mr. Grossman received $25,000 of the profit, the government alleged.    Call options allow an investor to buy a security at a specific price, usually above the current price and within a limited period.    The Securities and Exchange Commission uncovered the case after the Philadelphia Stock Exchange noticed that members of Mr. Grossman's family accounted for 86% of all activity in such Colt options nationwide in mid-July 1986.    At the time, Mr. Grossman was an associate at Kramer Levin, which Colt's pension-plan trustees had retained. Mr. Grossman was told of the recapitalization by another young lawyer at the firm. That lawyer and other Kramer Levin employees weren't accused of wrongdoing.    Mr. Grossman's family profited because after Colt's announcement July 20, 1986, that it would distribute more than $1.5 billion to holders in the recapitalization, Colt shares shot up in New York Stock Exchange composite trading by almost $27, to more than $93, in one trading day.    Mr. Grossman is the only person charged criminally in the case. The other six individuals are named in a related SEC civil action.    During the trial, Howard Wilson, the lead prosecutor, relied on Kramer Levin phone records that he said showed Mr. Grossman made 45 phone calls from his office to his relatives before the Colt plan was announced, and 13 calls to a small securities firm where his brother-in-law had Colt options in an account.    Prosecutors also produced as a witness David Lev, a brother-in-law of a Grossman cousin. Mr. Lev is a convicted perjurer who was granted immunity from prosecution in the Grossman case in exchange for his testimony.    &quot;Little Israel Grossman,&quot; Mr. Seidman had said to the jury, is &quot;not an Ivan Boesky, he's not a yuppie, he's not on Wall Street. He's not even an investment banker.&quot;    Mr. Giuliani's office had lost the last insider-trading case it had to prove before a jury, against Thomas C. Reed, a former presidential adviser, in late 1985. </TEXT></DOC>
