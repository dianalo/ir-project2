it is not exact, but is claimed to yield a tremendousreduction in the number of bytes needed to describe a picture so that apicture made up of 2Mb to 3Mb of data can be reduced to between 400 and 600bytes, the new company claims, suggesting that when combined with superfastgraphics processing chips, the potential in graphic arts is unimaginable.andM;Samsung Information Systems, San Jose, California has unveiled thePCtermina/286, a 12MHz diskless workstation that uses the Intel 80286microprocessor and includes four expansion slots, as well as its firstproduct designed in the US, the SE2100 Ethernet interface board: thePCterminal/286 was co-developed with Novell Inc and is optimised for NetWare,and the extra expansion slots are claimed to privde the AT-alike with greaterflexibility than competing workstations;
