Augustine once proclaimed what he calls the Law of Propagation of Misery: &quot;If a sufficient number of management layers are superimposed on top of each other,&quot; he reasoned, &quot;it can be assured that disaster is not left to chance.&quot;    Now, as president and chief operating officer of Martin Marietta Corp., Mr. Augustine is taking a stab at avoiding that fate. This week, he streamlined the company's operations, creating five new units that each report directly to him. The new structure eliminates a layer of management and is supposed to make Martin Marietta &quot;more competitive and more efficient,&quot; he says.    The step also advances the leadership transition already under way at the Bethesda, Md.-based aerospace and information systems concern. Thomas G. Pownall, the 65-year-old chairman and chief executive officer, is expected to retire next spring, when his one-year extension granted by the board expires. Mr. Augustine, a 51-year-old former Defense Department official, is expected to succeed him. And Caleb B. Hurtt, a 55-year-old executive vice president, is expected to become chief operating officer.    The changing of the guard probably won't result in a change of course for Martin Marietta, which in recent years has shed low-technology businesses and focused on missiles, sophisticated navigation devices and aerospace and information systems. But since many government contracts these days are awarded on a fixed-price basis (meaning that companies can't pass along cost overruns to the government), Mr. Augustine probably will put even more emphasis on efficiency and production quality.    He is also likely to emerge as a prominent spokesman for the aerospace industry, which has had image problems lately because of charges of waste and fraud. He is known as the author of &quot;Augustine's Laws,&quot; a book of 52 maxims, like the one on layers of management, that provide a whimsical look at what's wrong with American industry. Take, for example, his Law of the Core Dump:    &quot;The thickness of the proposal required to win a multimillion-dollar contract is about one millimeter per million dollars. If all the proposals conforming to this standard were piled on top of each other at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, it would probably be a good idea.&quot;    Moreover, Mr. Augustine's two stints at the Pentagon in the 1960s and 1970s establish him as someone who understands the government's point of view. And his self-effacing demeanor is disarming.    &quot;He has credibility,&quot; says Robert C. Little, a vice president at McDonnell Douglas Corp. in St. Louis. &quot;He comes on in a manner that is acceptable and enjoyable. He can handle things without making a lot of people mad.&quot;    For his part, Mr. Augustine dismisses suggestions that he might speak for others. &quot;I'm a spokesman for myself,&quot; he says, noting that both industry and government officials often disagree with him.    But he gets respect in both industry and government. Recently he was chosen to lead a Pentagon-sponsored task force that studied the decline of the U.S. semiconductor industry. The group recommended setting up a consortium to develop advanced computer chips and manufacturing processes. Mr. Augustine appeared on ABC's &quot;Nightline&quot; to defend the proposal.    Luck has been a big factor throughout his career. While growing up in Denver, he had hoped to become a forest ranger. But his high school adviser persuaded him to apply to Princeton, and he accepted admission before realizing that Princeton didn't offer forestry courses. Instead, he majored in aeronautical engineering.    He still enjoys the outdoors. He plans to spend this weekend backpacking with his children in Colorado. On other vacations, they have trekked the Oregon Trail in a covered wagon, explored Africa from a hot-air balloon and ridden a dog sled in Alaska.    Chance also led Mr. Augustine to Martin Marietta. In late 1976, while serving as undersecretary of the Army, he was within a day or two of leaving the government to take a job with another company because, he says, he was running out of money. At a luncheon attended by 2,000 people, he wound up sitting next to Martin Marietta's Mr. Pownall, who suggested that he reconsider his plans. Mr. Augustine joined Martin Marietta the following year.    Largely because of Mr. Pownall, Martin Marietta is a very different company from the one Mr. Augustine joined a decade ago. In 1982, Bendix Corp. tried to take over Martin Marietta. But Mr. Pownall, a U.S. Naval Academy graduate, fought back. He borrowed $1 billion to launch a retaliatory tender offer against Bendix in what became known as the &quot;Pac-Man&quot; anti-takeover defense. Later, Mr. Pownall sold off the company's cement, chemical and aluminum operations to pay back the debt.    Mr. Pownall &quot;managed to transform the company quite deftly into a major force in the aerospace industry and, at the same time, to prune away the basic-industry segments that weren't good investments for the company,&quot; says Robert Kugel, an analyst at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.    When Mr. Augustine takes over, he is expected to work closely with Mr. Hurtt. An engineer, Mr. Hurtt has spent the past 31 years working his way up through the ranks of Martin Marietta's aerospace operations. He has overseen the Titan rocket program, the Viking unmanned landings on Mars and the company's work on NASA's Skylab space station.    &quot;The two of us complement each other very well,&quot; Mr. Augustine says of Mr. Hurtt and himself. &quot;I bring an outside perspective.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
