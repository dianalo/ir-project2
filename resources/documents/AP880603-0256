Sakharov saidFriday that Mikhail S. Gorbachev has not yet guaranteed humanrights but that the Soviet leader must be given time and trust tocarry out his reforms.   Sahharov, the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner and a formerpolitical exile, told reporters at the Foreign Ministry presscenter that his unprecedented appearance at a government building``reflects a change in the situation in this country, and it's nota matter of me changing my position.''   He held his news conference in the same hall where Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday held his first formal meetingwith reporters in the Soviet Union.   Sakharov, 67, handed Gorbachev a list of names of 200 politicalprisoners when they met for the first time in January. On Friday,he called again for the release of those who remain incarceratedfor their beliefs.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Unemployment increased for the first time thisyear to 5.6 percent in May, the Labor Department said Friday. Butboth government officials and private economists cautioned that thejob figures for last month are too unreliable to suggest that theeconomy is losing steam.   The 0.2 percentage point increase from April's 14-year-lowcivilian jobless rate of 5.4 percent reflected a seasonallyadjusted shrinking of the U.S. labor force by 363,000 people, with536,000 fewer Americans at work.   But before the seasonal adjustments made in the government'shousehold survey to reflect an historically burgeoning job marketin May with the end of school terms, the actual number of peopleworking increased by 317,000.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Pentagon's drug coordinator listed forCongress on Friday a series of obstacles the military faces inplaying an expanded role in the drug war, among them planes toofast to catch the little aircraft smugglers use and military policenot trained to read people their rights.   Marine Lt. Gen. Stephen G. Olmstead, deputy assistant secretaryof defense for drug policy and enforcement, noted that the JointChiefs of Staff are preparing a plan for an escalated militaryanti-drug effort. Such an expanded military presence in the fightagainst drugs is part of legislation authorizing the Pentagon'sspending programs for the upcoming fiscal year.   One solution to detecting drug smugglers flying over theU.S.-Mexican border, Olmstead told a House Government Operationssubcommittee, would be to use airborne detection planes: the AirForce AWACS, the Navy's E2C and the Navy's P-3.</TEXT><DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A bomb hidden in a trash binexploded on a busy street corner Friday, killing four people andinjuring 19 in South Africa's deadliest bombing in more than a year.   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok blamed the African NationalCongress guerrilla movement, which has been accused of four otherbombings in the past nine days.   The ANC has not commented on the recent bombings. But it issueda statement Friday from its headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, sayingthe month of June ``must be a period of united and decisive popularoffensive'' against the government.</TEXT><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Another Arab strike paralyzed the occupiedlands Friday, and a 20-year-old man shot in the chest became the200th Palestinian killed since a rebellion against Israeli rulebegan six months ago.   Officials at Alia hospital in Hebron said relatives of MustafaAhmed Halaika told them the man was shot by Jewish settlers in thenearby West Bank village of Shuykh.   He died of a bullet wound in the chest, and three other Arabswere wounded by gunfire in the village, the hospital officialssaid.

Shultz saidFriday that Arabs and Israelis must accept that they will each haveto compromise to reach a fair settlement of the Middle Eastconflict.   Shultz, arriving on his fourth mission to promote a U.S. peaceplan for the Middle East, told reporters on a flight from Londonthat he has ``no particular indication'' of changes in positionssince his last failed effort two months ago.   In a five-page arrival statement, Shultz said the root of theArab-Israeli dispute ``is the competition between two nationalmovements for sovereignty on one land.''</TEXT><DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Iraqiy drove off anIranian warplane that flew 110 miles into Iraq and tried to bombPresident Saddam Hussein's family home north of Baghdad, a mil forces onFridaitarycommand announced.   While maneuvering to evade Iraqi ground fire, the Iranian jet``dropped all its load of explosives indiscriminately'' in thevillage of Ouja, just south of Tikrit, Saddam's hometown, theofficial Iraqi News Agency said.   No injuries were reported in the attack at 5:55 a.m., accordingto the news agency. The report, monitored in Nicosia, did not saywhether Saddam was home at the time. It was the first time theIraqis have reported an ate early-warning radar planes pending overhaulstostrengthen their wings, officials said Friday.   According to one Navy source, 28 of the 98 Hawkeyes now inservice have been grounded until they can receive the overhaul workby the Grumman Corp.   The disclosure that such a large percentage of the``eye-in-the-sky'' surveillance planes are now grounded was madeFriday during congressional testimony by Marine Lt. Gen. Stephen G.Olmstead, deputy assistant secretary of defense for drug policy andenforcement.   Olmstead appeared before a House Government Operationssubcommittee to discuss proposals to increase the military's rolein the war on drug smuggling. In the process, he informed the panelthe Navy's E-2C's were ``in bad trouble with cracked wingproblems.''   ``The Navy has a major rehabilitation problem,'' the generalcontinued, saying 34 out of a fleet of 85 were out of service.   ``I'm not sure any would be available (for a crackdown onsmuggling). We have just reduced the force by a drastic number thepast year.''   The Navy declined to discuss the matter late Friday. But severalsources who spoke only on condition they not be named acknowledgedthe service was facing a serious problem, while adding they couldnot confirm the general's figures.   According to the sources, there are 98 Hawkeyes now in the U.S.inventory instead of the 85 cited by Olmstead. Of that total, fourare assigned to the Coast Guard and Customs Service for druginterdiction work.   Those four planes have not been grounded, however, so all 28 nowunder flight restriction are assigned to the military, the sourcescontinued. Even with the groundings, the officials insisted theNavy has enough of the planes to equip its aircraft carriers whenthey go out on a deployment.   The E-2C is a twin-engine turbo-prop that carries a large,rotating radar dome atop its fuselage. Hawkeyes recently haveplayed critical roles maintaining surveillance and directing combatoperations in the Persian Gulf. In October 1985, an E-2C guided thefighters that intercepted a plane carrying the hijackers of theItalian cruise ship Achille Lauro.   The Navy first disclosed the wing fatigue problem in February1987, announcing that seven of the planes had been grounded and 10prohibited from operating off aircraft carriers.   The service has stressed from the beginning it did not blame theplane's prime contractor, the Grumman Corp., for the wing fatigueproblem. Rather, in order to modernize the plane over the years,more sophisticated and heavier radar and communications equipmenthad to be added, the Navy explained.   The original ``A'' model of the plane, for example, weighedroughly 48,000 pounds, while the current ``C'' model weighs atleast 52,500 pounds.   Given the constant poundings of carrier take-offs and landings,that extra weight has placed more stress on the Hawkeye wings thanthey were originally designed to handle. As the planes age, most ofthem will have to undergo the wing overhauls, the Navy says.   Larry Hamilton, a Grumman spokesman, said the company hascompleted three Hawkeye overhauls and now has five planesundergoing the work at a facility in St. Augustine, Fla.   Hamilton said two of the planes assigned to the Coast Guard andCustoms Service had required some wing work this spring, but addedthat work involved a different problem ``and eventually, they'llhave to come back'' for the overhaul.   According to the Navy, it costs about $250,000 to overhaul asingle wing and $600,000 if a wing has to be replaced.</TEXT></DOC>
