(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three young people said farewell to thefathers they never knew, almost two decades after the two men werekilled in Laos in the last major offensive of the Vietnam War.   ``It has been a long time - their children were infants whenthey died,'' Chaplain Lt. Col. John Morrison said Friday at theburial ceremony in Arlington National Cemetery.   A chain of POW-MIA bracelets was draped over the casket of Capt.Keith A. Brandt of Bellingham, Wash., a helicopter pilot who diedalong the Xe Pon River in March 1971 while trying to rescuestranded South Vietnamese soldiers.   Lt. Alan B. Boffman of Norfolk, Va., co-pilot of Brandt'shelicopter, was buried in the same ceremony.   Don George of Vietnam Veterans of America Chapter 165 ofBellingham said it was difficult to give up his POW-MIA bracelet.   ``I had always hoped and wished he would come back alive,''George said. ``I guess the odds were not in favor of that but youdo hope and hope and hope.''   Family members declined to talk to reporters. George said,though, that the captain's brother, Garth Brandt, told him, ``Nowwe don't have to worry anymore. We know he's back home.''   Brandt, a pilot who was 31 at the time of his death, was theleader of an attack helicopter section of the 101st AviationBattalion Company D.   He and Boffman, age 24, volunteered to lead rescuers to the bombcrater where survivors of the 420-member South Vietnamese battalionhad retreated.   At a private funeral Friday at Fort Meyer, Va., Morrison said,he spoke with Brandt's sons, Eric, 21, and Garth, 19, of MillCreek, Wash., and Boffman's daughter, Carla, of Fayetteville, N.C.   He said he told them to be proud of their fathers.   ``I indicated to the children that we knew they would alwayshonor their dads' supreme sacrifice and that this service was forthe rest of the nation to honor them,'' he said.   Also attending the service were Brandt's widow, Donna Hager ofMill Creek, and mother, Lorraine Brandt of Bellingham, as well asBoffman's widow, Jean Boffman Williams of Fayetteville, and mother,Bessie Boffman of Baltimore, Md.   A single casket with the remains of both men was brought to theburial site in a procession with a military band, color guard andtwo riderless horses. After a 21-gun salute, Mrs. Williams wipedaway tears as the band played ``Taps'' and ``America theBeautiful.''   George later took the bracelets to the Vietnam Memorial inWashington. He left a message on a paper napkin that he said hescribbled when he awoke in the middle of the night Thursday:   ``Sleep in peace at last in the soil of your native country,which will always remember gratefully your supreme sacrifice in thecourse of fulfilling your duty for God and country.''</TEXT></DOC>
