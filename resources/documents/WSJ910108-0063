In its annual report Syntex showed capsules of thedrug spilling forth as shining examples of research. Itpictured the drug's inventor, Gabriel Garay, at work in hislab.   Five years later, that scene of ideal science has beenshattered by angry recriminations, and so far Syntex hasfailed to get the drug, enprostil, approved for sale in theU.S. Critics are charging that the company, after investingmillions in the drug's development, played down -- and evensuppressed -- potentially serious safety problems that couldhinder its approval.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Garay says it was he who sounded alarms internallyover enprostil, warning it could cause dangerous blood clotsand actually prompt new ulcers. Even when an outsideresearcher agreed there were potential dangers, Syntexexecutives dismissed the findings as preliminary. Mr. Garaysays Syntex then forced him out.   Angry over his ousting, Mr. Garay told the Food and DrugAdministration of his concerns about enprostil's safety. TheFDA reprimanded the company. But Syntex, which had $1.52billion in sales in its last fiscal year, insists that thedrug is safe -- it is sold abroad -- and that Mr. Garay isjust a disgruntled employee trying to bolster awrongful-dismissal charge he filed against the company.   Enprostil's troubled story begins in 1977, when Mr. Garay,a senior Syntex researcher with a Ph.D. in pharmacology, leda team that created the new drug, which was designed to turnoff stomach acid and thus help heal ulcers. Syntex won apatent on the compound in 1978 and named Mr. Garay and twocolleagues as co-inventors.   The market was potentially immense. About 23 millionpeople world-wide have ulcer problems, and treatment productslike Smith-Kline Beecham's Tagamet and Glaxo Holdings PLC'sZantac have yielded billions in sales. Enprostil wasconservatively forecast to generate sales of $50 million to$100 million a year. For Syntex, the timing was perfect:Sales of the new drug would help offset the expiration of thepatent on its big moneymaker, Naprosyn, an anti-inflammatorydrug.   By a stroke of scientific serendipity, Syntex alsodiscovered that enprostil not only healed ulcers but loweredcholesterol, through an active ingredient Syntex called RSfor short. This raised the possibility of big sales inanother market. Researchers, however, eventually found thatenprostil and RS tended to make blood platelets clot in thetest tube, posing a possible risk of stroke or heart attack.Moreover, the agents, while healing existing stomach ulcers,seemed to cause new ones.   In 1981, on the eve of a proposed study of enprostil givenintravenously, Mr. Garay requested guinea pig studies tocheck out the clotting problem. According to court testimony,Syntex researcher Anthony Willis confirmed that clottingoccurred in animals and wrote a memo warning that the drug inintravenous form could provoke a &quot;possibly fatal or cripplingthromboembolism.&quot;   John Fried, then president of the company's SyntexResearch division and now additionally the company's vicechairman, ordered the memo rewritten. In court Mr. Friedtestified that the memo was &quot;inflammatory&quot; and &quot;speculative.&quot;Intravenous trials were canceled, though other types of humantests would take place. A Syntex spokeswoman said Mr. Friedwouldn't comment for this article.   In 1985, with its new-drug application pending before theFDA, Syntex pushed ahead with its clinical research onenprostil. A Philadelphia physician and researcher, MaxCohen, conducted a study for Syntex to test whether the drugcould protect the stomach lining from the effects of liquor.He put a tube down the throat of some volunteers and sprayedtheir stomachs with enprostil, and then sprayed again withalcohol to observe the results.   &quot;In every single subject, enprostil significantlyincreased the damage caused by alcohol,&quot; recalls Dr. Cohen,who testified at the trial of Mr. Garay's suit. &quot;One subjectwas dropped from the study because he developed fairlysubstantial damage from enprostil alone. This was a startlingobservation.&quot; But when he called Syntex, urging follow-upstudies, he says, Syntex stalled.   &quot;They persuaded me not to publish&quot; the results, says Dr.Cohen, now a professor of surgery at the University ofColorado at Denver. &quot;It became clear these studies weren'tgoing to be done, and they weren't going to be done by me. Iwas getting nowhere with Syntex. . . . I had neverencountered this kind of pressure -- pressure and deception,I would say.&quot;   Syntex Chairman Paul Freiman says he regrets Syntex &quot;saton&quot; Dr. Cohen's data. &quot;Syntex should have been more active&quot;in following up the findings, he says. But he adds thatspraying the drug in the stomach, rather than using capsulesas the company planned to do, was an &quot;oddball&quot; study design,the conclusions of which were at odds with previous findings.He also notes that the company has a long tradition ofscientific research. &quot;The whole process of developing a drugtakes 10 years, and if you look backwards at any point intime you can find things you wish you had done differently,&quot;he says.   In early 1986, a different sort of test went awry. Duringanimal tests of the spinoff anti-cholesterol agent RS, twoout of three test dogs suddenly died. Mr. Garay testifiedthat he planned follow-up studies to determine the precisecause of death, but that Syntex management squelched theresearch -- a claim Syntex denies.   Mr. Fried and other managers, however, testified that thedog deaths were &quot;unsurprising&quot; because the drug was givenrapidly, and because other chemicals were used in the test.Though Syntex reported the deaths to the FDA team reviewingRS, it didn't tell the team reviewing enprostil. Syntexcalled this &quot;an oversight&quot; that the company corrected afterMr. Garay discovered it.   In a December 1986 meeting with the FDA, Syntex sufferedanother setback. The company was arguing that RS should bepermitted to proceed to human clinical trials because it wasjust four times stronger than enprostil, and enprostil hadalready been approved for human trials. However, Mr. Garaysays he told the FDA he believed RS could be up to 30 timesas potent -- a potential safety concern. So the FDA blockedfurther human tests of RS until Syntex could supply a fullsafety and toxicology report on the drug.   Syntex, in court testimony, blamed the FDA's decision on apoor showing by Mr. Garay. Mr. Garay counters that corporategreed had driven the company to make a &quot;rushed, weak&quot; FDAapplication for RS because &quot;the cash registers had startedjingling.&quot; Straying from the Syntex party line is whatdamaged his career, he says in an interview.   In the spring of 1987, with the FDA blocking RS humantests in the U.S., Syntex turned to the United Kingdom as atest site. Mr. Garay testified that his superior, RogerWhiting, prepared a briefing report for U.K. officials thatdidn't mention safety hazards the research team had found.Syntex's Mr. Fried testified that Syntex's U.K. reportincluded all &quot;relevant&quot; data. Mr. Freiman calls charges thatthe report was sanitized &quot;totally false.&quot; A spokeswoman forSyntex said Mr. Whiting declined comment for this article.   Then in May of 1987, Mr. Whiting's own research ignitedanother dispute. Mr. Whiting proved in the lab that bothdrugs worked by a mechanism -- called &quot;thromboxane agonism&quot;-- known to cause clotting and spasms in veins and arteries.This further raised the danger of possible strokes or heartattacks in patients.   In court, Mr. Whiting testified that this research washalted by Mr. Fried. Mr. Fried, according to Mr. Garay andother Syntex employees who testified, further ordered theenprostil team not to discuss the matter with the FDA. SaidMr. Garay in testimony: &quot;I thought that, actually, he wastelling us to break the law.&quot;   Mr. Fried testified he never stopped any research, norordered any cover-up. But he admitted concern that the teamwas &quot;going around in circles rather than going forward in ameaningful manner&quot; and was potentially wasting the FDA'stime. Court records show Mr. Fried repeatedly attacked ordismissed unfavorable study reports as &quot;preliminary,&quot;&quot;speculative,&quot; &quot;inflammatory&quot; or &quot;irrelevant.&quot;   Mr. Freiman backs Mr. Fried's scientific judgment calls.But when pressed about whether it was wise to counsel theSyntex team not to discuss its findings with the FDA, hesaid: &quot;In hindsight, no. My own feeling is we have to be asopen as we can.&quot;   Mr. Garay testified that, in June 1987, he was summoned byMr. Whiting and fired as head of gastrointestinalpharmacology. He says he was told the section was beingexpanded into a department and Syntex was recruiting anexpert to head it. The job was already being advertised inscientific journals.   &quot;I looked up the ad,&quot; Mr. Garay says. &quot;The job theydescribed was mine to a T, right down to the number of yearsof experience.&quot;   Syntex says Mr. Garay was never officially head ofgastrointestinal pharmacology at the company and that hewasn't fired, but resigned when he wasn't named to lead thedepartment; the company says it offered to let him continuein a post as a senior scientist. Syntex never made a seriousattempt to disparage Mr. Garay's science in court, butcompany lawyers said he spent too much time on raquetball andreal-estate ventures. Mr. Fried added that it was Mr. Garaywho was too &quot;promotional&quot; about enprostil.   Mr. Garay denies he indulged in sports or personalbusiness on company time. And he adds: &quot;I'm an advocate {ofenprostil}. But I'm an advocate of a safe drug.&quot;   Mr. Garay cleaned out his desk and hired a lawyer. Then hewrote the FDA reporting his safety concerns. Almost exactlythree years later, a state court jury in San Jose, Calif.,came back in with its decision on the wrongful dismissallawsuit Mr. Garay filed against Syntex. The jury believed Mr.Garay, and awarded him a $17.5 million judgment, including$15 million in punitive damages, partly because of evidencethat Syntex failed to submit required safety reports to theFDA. Syntex is appealing the verdict.   The company's appeals attorney, Ezra Hendon, calls thelawsuit &quot;a very lame claim&quot; and says Mr. Garay trumped up thesafety issue to claim higher damages. &quot;What we've seen is amad scramble to find a tort, to manipulate the facts,&quot; Mr.Hendon charges. &quot;But when you sort it out, who was injured?&quot;The judge in the case reduced the jury's award to $3.6million from $17.5 million, in part because he found noevidence that anyone had been hurt by the drug.   Syntex calls the jury verdict &quot;an outrage&quot; and insists itdidn't do anything wrong; there was simply honestdisagreement in the company over the significance of thedisputed studies, company executives say. &quot;To the best of myknowledge, no one at Syntex ever `hid' data from FDA on anyinvestigational new drug -- or any new drug,&quot; says Mr.Freiman. &quot;That is totally contrary to our policy andsomething that we do not countenance.&quot; As for its failure tocross-reference adverse data on RS and enprostil with theFDA, he says, &quot;Our error turned out to be one of too littleduplication, not of omission.&quot;   Events after Mr. Garay's departure from Syntex largelyconfirm the substance of his concerns about enprostil'ssafety.   In February 1988, the FDA met with Syntex and said sideeffects made it unlikely enprostil could win broad marketapproval as a treatment for common ulcers. Shortly afterward,Syntex withdrew its application. Today, Syntex is stilltesting enprostil for a smaller niche market -- treatment ofulcers induced by aspirin and other drugs. The development ofRS was halted because it caused too much diarrhea in dogstudies, Mr. Fried testified.   After months spent investigating Mr. Garay's complaint,the FDA in May 1988 issued a &quot;Notice of Adverse Findings&quot;against the company, citing its failure to make promptreports of &quot;significant adverse findings&quot; to federalofficials and outside researchers. The FDA issues about 2,500of these notices to companies every year, often addressingmatters such as witholding of data.   &quot;It's the mildest form of discipline that FDA could haveimposed,&quot; says Mr. Hendon, Syntex's appeals attorney. &quot;Thisisn't the crime of the century.&quot;   But even after the FDA's action, the debate continued overwhen to publish negative findings concerning enprostil.   For example, in 1988, Jonathan Isenberg, chairman ofgastroenterology at the University of California at SanDiego, conducted a follow-up study for Syntex on howenprostil affects the stomach lining. Dr. Isenberg testedenprostil in its normal capsule form and observed similarstomach-lining damage to that which Dr. Cohen found. Syntexsays that, in accordance with company policy, it urged himnot to publish his findings until a larger and moredefinitive study was completed. Dr. Isenberg, who didn'treturn phone calls seeking comment for this article, at onepoint wrote Syntex a letter saying that &quot;the good as well asthe bad of scientific inquiry needs to be published.&quot;   Mr. Freiman says that, last month, the broader study waspublished in a medical journal and that it concluded thestomach lesions aren't clinically relevant. The company alsoeventually reported Dr. Cohen's initial study to the FDA andsays it is satisfied that all relevant research is nowpublic. &quot;This is an honest-to-God scientific company thatwants to see the truth come out,&quot; Mr. Freiman said.   However, Sandor Szabo, a Harvard professor and formermember of the FDA advisory panel on enprostil, says thatoverall, Syntex waited too long to report its findings onenprostil. &quot;Whenever there's an adverse finding, it should bereported immediately -- simple medical ethics would dictateit,&quot; says Dr. Szabo, who was an expert witness for Mr. Garayduring his litigation. &quot;It's impossible to say how frequently{withholding data} occurs, unless someone brings a suit, likeDr. Garay did.&quot;   Mr. Freiman says that since Syntex has complied with theFDA's notice, the federal agency now is satisfied with thecompany's conduct. An FDA spokesman declines to comment onthe case.   Mr. Garay, now 50 years old, says he has tried to get anew job, but he believes all the litigation has scaredpotential employers away. Today, he continues withindependent drug development work from his San Franciscohome.   For its part, Syntex issued an updated management manuallast June emphasizing guidelines for issuing research reports&quot;that are accurate and do not mislead.&quot; Mr. Freiman says,&quot;Our senses were heightened by this Garay thing that we'vegot an awesome responsibility. There is no room for error.You've got to report out, and report out in a timely way.&quot;   Enprostil, meanwhile, is sold in France and Mexico withoutserious problems, Syntex says. In those countries, the drug'slabels warn of such side effects as stomach pain anddiarrhea. There is no warning of possible clotting orulceration.   ---                        Syntex's Business                                                                                                                              Trying to Diversify...
