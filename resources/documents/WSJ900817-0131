The Jordanian monarch, a neighbor and friend of Iraqileader Saddam Hussein, visited President Bush for two hoursat the president's Maine vacation home in hope of defusingthe military tension that has been building since Iraqinvaded Kuwait. The king indicated that Amman generallyintends to abide by international sanctions against Iraq bychoking the flow of Iraqi goods through the Jordanian port ofAqaba. But neither he nor President Bush expressed anyoptimism about a negotiated end to the crisis.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I did not come away from that conversation with anyfeeling of hope that Saddam Hussein would do that which he'sbeen called upon to do under international law,&quot; Mr. Bushsaid.   For his part, King Hussein said he was &quot;leaving with aclearer idea of what the president's thinking is.&quot; But heacknowledged that there hadn't been any breakthrough. At onepoint in a brief exchange with reporters, he seemed almostfatalistic as he pledged to continue trying to bring his U.S.and Iraqi friends together.   &quot;I suppose one has to have hope,&quot; he said. &quot;Without hopeyou can't get anywhere. And the dangers are such that it'sunthinkable to contemplate the idea of giving up and nottrying one's best to resolve this problem to the satisfactionof all.&quot; The king denied persistent reports that he carried aspecific message or negotiating proposal from Saddam Hussein.   Separately, a senior Jordanian official told reportersthat Jordan doesn't intend to condone Iraq's occupation orannexation of Kuwait. He said Jordan's low-key response toBaghdad's moves, which has been so mild as to anger U.S.officials, was designed to keep alive King Hussein's effortsto reverse Iraqi policy. He suggested the king's effort wasderailed by the rapid international diplomatic and militaryresponse that escalated tensions.   While prospects for a diplomatic resolution of the crisisremained weak, the outlook also grew dimmer for the quickdeparture of Americans who have been stuck in Iraq and Kuwaitsince the invasion. In a move that troubled Bushadministration officials, Iraqis overseeing the occupation ofKuwait declared that the estimated 2,500 Americans in Kuwaitshould gather at a Kuwaiti hotel. The officials issued asimilar demand for British citizens.   By gathering these foreign nationals in one spot, Iraqiauthorities would increase their control over them. The orderraised fears that the Americans and Britons in Kuwait mightbe moved to Iraq.   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Iraqiauthorities told the U.S. ambassador to Kuwait, NathanielHowell, that the Americans were being gathered to protectthem from some unspecified threat, and they asked him forcompliance within two hours. The ambassador replied that hewould inform Americans but couldn't order them to move. Heprotested the demand.   A senior State Department official said the Iraqicommander who conveyed the order hinted to the ambassadorthat if Americans didn't comply, he would send his troops outto round them up.   President Bush tried to avoid escalating U.S. rhetoricabout the Americans, arguing that &quot;it's more dangerous, Ithink, if I heighten the concern.&quot; But he said the order forAmericans to gather was a &quot;violation of international norms&quot;and added: &quot;Anything that compels individuals to do anythingagainst their will would, of course, concern me.&quot;   Meanwhile, Saddam Hussein issued another statement,calling Mr. Bush and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak &quot;liars&quot;and warning that if the U.S. persists, &quot;you are going toreceive some American bodies in bags.&quot; The Iraqi leader alsosaid that for the U.S. to demand that he withdraw from Kuwaitis like Iraq demanding that the U.S. &quot;withdraw from thesouthern states in the United States.&quot;   While Iraq has sent hints in recent days that it'sinterested in negotiating about its occupation of Kuwait, Mr.Bush continues to show little interest in holding such talks.King Hussein, after his meeting with President Bush, saidtheir discussion was &quot;open&quot; and &quot;candid,&quot; words that suggestthe talk was blunt.   King Hussein did please U.S. officials by suggesting thatJordan is observing U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq andwon't serve as a conduit for goods heading to Iraq inviolation of the U.N.-ordered embargo. Just three days ago,President Bush threatened to stop ships going into Jordan'sonly port, Aqaba, if their cargo is destined for Iraq.   Later, the Pentagon formally announced the procedures U.S.warships will follow to prevent civilian vessels from pickingup or delivering shipments to Iraq and Kuwait. The decision,which had been expected but wasn't spelled out untilyesterday, authorizes the U.S. Navy to interdict cargo shipsby warning them to stop, searching them for materials coveredby United Nations sanctions and using &quot;the minimal amount offorce necessary&quot; to divert the vessels to other ports.   The Jordanian port of Aqaba is explicitly included in the&quot;primary area of operation&quot; in the Persian Gulf, Gulf ofOman, and the Red Sea announced by the Pentagon.   During his discussion, King Hussein also told Secretary ofState James Baker that Jordan is seeking a ruling from theUnited Nations about whether food shipments would be allowedunder its sanctions resolution, which allows shipments ofgoods for undefined humanitarian reasons. Referring to foodshipments, King Hussein said: &quot;I believe there are certaincategories or areas where the situation is unclear.&quot;   Taken together, the comments suggest that Jordan intendsto follow the trade embargo voted by the U.N. in response toBaghdad's military takeover of Kuwait but also wants toplease Iraq by exploiting any loopholes considered legallyacceptable.   President Bush suggested that he was generally, but nottotally, satisfied with Jordan's position, saying&quot;differences that possibly existed with Jordan have beennarrowed.&quot;   Mr. Bush also showed little concern about Iraq's attemptthis week to settle its differences with Iran, a step someanalysts said could ease military pressure on Baghdad andlead to economic cooperation between the two states. Heexpressed pleasure that Iran, which fought an eight-year warwith Iraq that ground to a halt only two years ago, continuesto criticize the Iraqi invasion.   After King Hussein left the presidential retreat, Mr. Bushmet with Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al Faisal. The Saudiofficial later said the U.S. decision to offer troops todefend Saudi Arabia against possible further Iraqi militarymoves &quot;will long be remembered.&quot; He asserted that the nextmove in the standoff is up to Iraq and said, &quot;What we arehoping for is for Iraq to respond to international will andArab will.&quot;   Separately, a senior Jordanian official suggested thatabiding by U.N. sanctions is particularly important to Jordanbecause of Amman's own insistence that the Israeli-occupiedWest Bank be returned to it under a 23-year-old U.N.resolution.   The official also said that Iraq's move into Kuwait mayhave represented a &quot;miscalculation&quot; by Saddam Hussein, whoprobably didn't anticipate the international response it hasaroused. But the Jordanian urged the U.S. to avoid a similarmiscalculation and refrain from military hostilities withIraq. He said a military fight &quot;in the long run is going tobe a major disaster, and mostly for you, the U.S.&quot; because itwould incite radicals and Islamic fundamentalists throughoutthe Middle East.
