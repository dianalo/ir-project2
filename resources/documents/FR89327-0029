Background</ITAG>Section 6 of the OFPP Act Amendments of 1988 amended the OFPP Act by addingsection 27, Procurement Integrity, which has been codified as section 423,Title 41 of the United States Code.The section on procurement integrity prohibits certain activities by competingcontractors and Government procurement officials during the conduct ofFederal procurements. In general, these prohibited activities involve solicitingor discussing post-Government employment, offering or accepting a gratuity,or soliciting or disclosing proprietary or source selection information.The section also (a) contains certification and disclosure provisions forboth contractors and Government officials, (b) imposes post-employmentrestrictions on Government personnel, and (c) provides for contractual,civil, and criminal penalties.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The proposed change to the FAR may have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. The impact is likely to occur because,in connection with contract awards, extensions, and modifications in excessof $100,000, offerors will be required to gather and provide to the Governmentcertain information regarding the activities of the offeror during theconduct of the procurement. Therefore, an Initial Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis (IRFA) has been prepared and will be sent to the Chief Counselfor Advocacy of the Small Business Administration. A copy of the IRFA maybe obtained from the FAR Secretariat. Comments are invited. Comments fromsmall entities concerning the affected FAR subparts will also be considered.Such comments must be submitted separately and cite FAR Case 89-610 incorrespondence.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This proposed rule contains information collection requirements withinthe meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, etseq. Annual reporting burden: The annual reporting burden is estimatedas follows: Respondents, 20,000; responses per respondent, 20; total annualresponses, 400,000; hours per response, 5 min.; and total response burdenhours, 33,333. Annual recordkeeping burden: The annual recordkeeping burdenwith respect to incorporating the training requirement into training programs,is estimaed as follows: Respondents, 20,000; responses per respondent,20; total annual responses, 400,000; hours per response, 20 min.; and totalresponse burden hours, 13,333. Accordingly, an information collection approvalrequest has been submitted to OMB for expedited review pursuant to 5 CFR1320.18. Public comments concerning the request should be submitted toOMB, Ms. Eyvette Flynn, FAR Desk Officer, Room 3235, NEOB, Washington,DC 20503 by April 26, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 1, 3, 4, 9, 15, 37, and 52</ITAG>Government procurement.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 24, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Harry S.

It requires more than official responsibility,knowledge, perfunctory involvement, or involvement on an administrativeor peripheral issue. A finding of substantiality should be based not onlyon the effort devoted to a matter, but on the importance of the effort.While a series of peripheral involvements may be insubstantial, the singleact of approving or participating in a critical step may be substantial.An employee whose responsibility is the review of a procurement solelyfor compliance with administrative control or budgetary considerations,and who reviews a document involved in the procurement for such a purpose,should not be regarded as having participated substantially in the procurement.(h) (1) ``Procurement official'' means any civilian or military officialor employee of an agency who has participated personally and substantiallyin the conduct of the agency procurement concerned, including all officialsand employees who are responsible for reviewing or approving the procurement.(2) ``Procurement official'' includes any civilian or military officialor employee of an agency who has participated personally and substantiallyin the following activities:(i) Development of acquisition plans.(ii) Development of specifications, statements of work, or purchase descriptions/requests.(iii) Evaluation or selection of a contractor.(iv) Negotiation or award of a contract or modification or extension toa contract.(3) For purposes of subparagraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2), the term ``employeeof an agency'' includes a contractor, subcontractor, consultant, expert,or advisor (other than a competing contractor) acting on behalf of, orproviding advice to, the agency with respect to any phase of the agencyprocurement concerned.(i) ``Property'' includes supplies as defined at 2.101.(j) (1) ``Proprietary information'' means_(i) Information contained in a bid or proposal;(ii) Cost or pricing data; or(iii) Any other information submitted to the Government by a contractorand designated as proprietary, in accordance with law or regulation, bythe contractor, the head of the agency, or the contracting officer.(2) It does not include information_(i) Furnished without limitations on its use;(ii) That is otherwise available to the Government, to a competing contractor,or to the public without restrictions; or(iii) Contained in subdivisions (j)(1) (i) or (ii) of this subsection thatthe contracting officer determines, after consultation with the contractor,would not reasonably be expected to cause the contractor competitive harmif disclosed to other competing contractors (see 3.104-5(d)).(k) (1) ``Source selection information'' means information determined bythe head of the agency or the contracting officer to be information_(i) The disclosure of which to a competing contractor would jeopardizethe integrity or successful completion of the procurement concerned; and(ii) Which is required by statute, regulation, or order to be secured ina source selection file or other restricted facility to prevent such disclosure;(2) ``Source selection information,'' includes documents, or oral or writtenextracts thereof, related to a particular procurement that_(i) Are contained in_(A) Acquisition plans (see 7.105); (B) Source selection plans, including technical evaluation plans, suchas those described in 15.612(c); (C) Field pricing reports and preaward surveys; (D) Prenegotiation memoranda (see 15.807); (E) Price negotiation memoranda (see 15.808(b)); or (ii) Result from the source selection process of such procurement, includingcompetitive range determinations, rankings, recommendations, technicalreports of the source selection board, or recommendations of the sourceselection advisory boards; and (iii) That are marked with an identification that identifies the documentas being contained in one of the categories specified in paragraphs (k)(2)(i) or (ii) of this subsection.

(3) Information marked by the contractor as proprietary shall not be releasedfor a period of ten business days from the issuance of the notice in subparagraph(d)(2) of this subsection. Thereafter, unless the contractor takes otheraction to prevent such release, the contracting officer may release theinformation. (e) Competing contractors may disclose, or authorize the Government todisclose, their company specific proprietary information to any employeeof the contractor and to other persons where not otherwise prohibited bylaw. (f) A person who discloses proprietary or source selection information,even though the information has not been stamped as such, shall not beconsidered to have violated the disclosure prohibitions set forth hereinunless that person knows, or should have known, such information is proprietaryor source selection information.<ITAG tagnum="80">3.104-6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Restrictions on Government officials and employees. </ITAG>For purposes of evaluating any certificate required by the Act, the term``Government official or employee,'' as used in subsection 27(e) of theAct refers to a person who was a Government official or employee on orafter May 16, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="80">3.104-7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Identification of date of beginning of procurement. </ITAG>(a) For prime contracts for the development or production of major elementsof a major system, the program manager shall publish in the Commerce BusinessDaily a notice when the development of a procurement solicitation begins.For purposes of this paragraph (a), a major system is a system where: (1) The total expenditures for research, development, test and evaluationfor the system are estimated to be more than $75,000,000, or the eventualtotal expenditure for procurement is expected to be more than $300,000,000;or  (2) The system is designated a ``major system'' by the head of the agencyresponsible for the system.

However, certain acts that are forbidden by theAct would be inappropriate at any time. It is generally recognized thatpotential contractors should not offer, and agency officials should notsolicit gratuities at any time. Similarly, potential contractors shouldnot solicit, and agency personnel should not offer, proprietary or sourceselection information at any time. However, potential contractors may offer,and Government employees may solicit, employment except as prohibited bylaw. During the period prior to the issuance of the procurement solicitation,contractors who wish to discuss employment opportunities with a possibleprocurement official should ask the other party whether he or she is aprocurement official for a procurement for which the contractor is a competingcontractor before conducting any discussions related to employment. Similarly,procurement officials who wish to solicit employment from a potential competingcontractor should ask whether the contractor is reasonably likely to becomea competing contractor on any procurement for which the procurement officialis responsible.(b) Agency personnel should be presumed to know the procurement for whichthey are procurement officials. Contractor personnel are presumed to knowthe procurements for which they are reasonably likely to be competing.Individuals who do not, in fact, know whether they are procurement officials,or whether the organization they represent is a competing contractor, shoulddefer any discussions regarding employment until these questions can beresolved by consulting appropriate parties within their respective organizations.(c) A competing contractor shall not be considered to have knowingly violatedthe prohibitions set forth in subsection 27(a)(1) of the Act if the contractorhas made an inquiry in good faith of the possible procurement officialand has been advised that the individual is not a procurement officialfor any procurement for which the contractor is a competing contractor.Similarly, a procurement official shall not be considered to have knowinglyviolated the prohibitions set forth in subsection 27(b)(1) of the Act,if the procurement official made inquiry in good faith of the potentialcontractor, and had been advised that the contractor would not be a competingcontractor on a procurement under the responsibility of the procurementofficial.(d) A competing contractor or procurement official shall not be consideredto have knowingly violated the prohibitions in subsection 27(a)(3) or 27(b)(3)of the Act if, before source selection information or proprietary informationwas solicited, obtained, or disclosed, the contractor or procurement official_(1) Had made an inquiry in good faith of the appropriate Government orcontractor official regarding whether information not released in accordancewith 3.104-4(j) or (k) was proprietary or source selection information;and(2) Had been advised by such official that the information was not proprietaryor source selection information.<ITAG tagnum="80">3.104-9</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Certification requirements.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Applicability.</T3> In accordance with subsection 27(d)(7)(A) of theAct, certification requirements set forth herein apply to contracts inexcess of $100,000 awarded on or after May 16, 1989, and to any contractextensions or modifications in excess of $100,000 executed on or afterMay 16, 1989, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this subsection.(b) <T3>Contractor certification.</T3> (1) In accordance with subsection 27(d)(1)of the Act, an agency shall not award a contract for the procurement ofproperty or services to any competing contractor, or agree to any modificationor extension of a contract, unless the officer or employee of such contractorresponsible for the offer or bid for such contract, or the modificationor extension of such contract_(i) Certifies in writing to the contracting officer responsible for suchcontract that such officer or employee of the competing contractor hasno information concerning a violation or possible violation of subsections27 (a), (b), (c), or (e) of the Act (see 3.104-3) as implemented in theFAR and agency supplements;
