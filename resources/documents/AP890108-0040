Shultz said Sunday theSoviet Union promised to look into U.S. allegations that Libya hasbuilt a factory to manufacture chemical weapons.   Shultz said he outlined the U.S. case and offered a descriptionof the plant to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze at ameeting in Paris, where an international conference on chemicalweapons opened Saturday.   Based on this ``general flow of evidence,'' Shultz said,Shevardnadze pledged the Soviets would make their own inquiry.   ``Since he cares about the subject and the Soviet Union caresabout the subject, there is no doubt the questions (to Libya) willbe pointed,'' Shultz told reporters just before leaving Paris.   ``I think that is a constructive response,'' he added.   Libya has denied the U.S. claim and said the facility 60 milessouthwest of Tripoli is intended to produce pharmaceuticals.   Earlier, in a speech to the conference, Shevardnadze announcedhis government will begin destroying its stockpile of chemicalweapons this year. Shevardnadze did not comment to reporters afterhis meeting with Shultz.   Shultz said the Soviets were given a statement of U.S. concernover the plant during the visit to New York last month of SovietPresident Mikhail Gorbachev. But in the meeting Sunday withShevardnadze, ``they heard a little more about it,'' Shultz said.   He said the U.S. goal is to prevent the plant, which the StateDepartment has said was on the verge of producing chemical weapons,from achieving production of poison gas. ``If we can succeed inthat, we'll feel gratified,'' he said.   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi often has turned to the Soviets forsupport when his country was the target of U.S. condemnation. But inthis case, Shultz said, the Soviets share the U.S. aversion tochemical weapons.   He said he believed the Soviets ultimately would back the UnitedStates on the issue.   Shultz sidestepped Shevardnadze's statements that the SovietUnion had never transferred poison gas to other countries.   ``I put that in terms of a pledge and I take it that way,''Shultz said.   In the past, the United States has alleged Soviet-backed forcesin Afghanistan used chemical weapons against U.S.-armed rebels.   Shultz reminded reporters that President-elect George Bush hadproposed outlawing possession of chemical weapons five years ago ata 40-nation disarmament conference in Geneva.   Shultz and Shevardnadze also signed two accords, on drugtrafficking and on scientific cooperation, and toasted each otherwith champagne afterward.   The two countries are to share information on suspected drugtraffickers and methods of intercepting drugs. They also agreed tocooperate in scientific research, including an exchange of experts.</TEXT></DOC>
