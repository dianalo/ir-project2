WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   East Germany's new premier today presented a28-member Cabinet that includes 11 non-Communists and called formore private enterprise to help the troubled economy, but herejected a free-market economy.   In his first speech since taking office Monday, Hans Modrow alsorejected the idea of German reunification as ``dangerous andunrealistic.''   The 500-member Parliament met today to approve Modrow's proposedCabinet, which will replace the body that resigned Nov. 7.   East German media said Communist Party chief Egon Krenz approvedthe Cabinet makeup Thursday, and no serious opposition was expectedin Parliament, which convened a two-day session today.   Despite more than a third of the seats being given tonon-Communists, the proposed Cabinet includes several holdoversfrom the former hard-line leadership of Erich Honecker, and theparty still dominates.   The non-Communists all come from parties that have beenCommunist allies.   After Modrow's speech, however, Manfred Gerlach, head of theLiberal Democrats, announced his party would no longer run inelections in a bloc with the Communists and called for ``truesharing of power'' in free voting.   His party was given three seats in the new Cabinet. In the past,the Cabinet has been subservient to the Communist Party leadership.   Gerlach has proposed ridding the Constitution of the Communists'40-year monopoly on power, and a parliamentary committee was to beset up to study that and other possible changes.   Modrow, in his speech to Parliament, outlined hopes forimproving the lives of East Germans while retaining a plannedsocialist economy.   He said the nation is ``open for proposals on joint ventures,investment, transfer of profits and environmental pilot projects,''all of which address some of the concerns of Western businesslooking for openings in the East German market.   ``The government sees as its most urgent responsibility thestabilization of the economy,'' Modrow said.   He called for ``increasing individual responsibility of theeconomic units'' and the introduction of some private enterprise toencourage East Germans to produce goods and services to help endshortages.   Modrow urged improvements in the sometimes stifling plannedeconomy but rejected a full free-market economy.   He called for a ``better socialism,'' with better supplies ofconsumer goods and a ``full and varied life'' for the East Germanpopulation.   Modrow also suggested legal and political reforms, includingremoval of restrictions that prohibit unauthorized publicgatherings and free expression. Authorities have tolerated massivepro-democracy demonstrations in East Germany in recent weeks, butsuch demonstrations remain technically illegal.   East German leaders have been struggling to retain a basicsocialist system in a nation swept by pro-democracy activism andtempted by offers of aid from West Germany in return forfree-market reforms.   ``We must have unwavering political and ideological tolerance,''Modrow said, apparently referring to Western appeals for EastGermany to accept some capitalist reforms.   ``By means of a new reality of life in the German DemocraticRepublic (East Germany), the dangerous and unrealistic talk of areunification will be clearly rejected,'' he said, drawing a longround of applause from lawmakers.   Modrow's government is faced with a struggling economy in needof a massive overhaul. He also must win popular trust for aleadership that until a month ago governed by Stalinist edicts.   The East German labor force has been impoverished this year bythe flight of more than 200,000 citizens to West Germany, althoughsome, encouraged by reforms, now are headed back to their homeland.   During his speech to Parliament, Gerlach repeated his call fornew legislation on voting rights and new elections.   But he made clear in an interview with East German televisionlater that he foresees no break with the nation's socialisttradition.   ``We are a party of socialists in a socialist system,'' Gerlachsaid of his Liberal Democratic Party. ``The task before us now isto define what socialism means and how we can make it meet theneeds of the people.''   On Thursday, the Communist Party stripped 27 people of theirseats in Parliament, including Honecker and his wife, Margot, whopreviously was sacked from her job as education minister.   The others who lost their seats were mainly officials associatedwith Honecker's orthodox rule, which ended Oct. 18 amid an exodusof East Germans fed up with their rigid homeland. Since Krenz tookover, East Germany has opened its borders to the West, and passageshave been carved in the Berlin Wall.   President Bush has expressed interest in closer ties to EastGermany and praised the nation's reform course in a message toKrenz, East Germany's official news agency ADN said today.Relations between Washington and East Berlin often were strainedunder Honecker.   In the written message to Krenz, Bush said he welcomed thecountry's new open-border policy, according to ADN. The news agencydid not say how or when the message was delivered.</TEXT></DOC>
