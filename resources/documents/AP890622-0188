(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Plans to attempt an override of Gov. MarioCuomo's latest veto of legislation to restore the death penalty inNew York state were scrapped Thursday because of a key senator'sillness.   New York governors have vetoed death penalty bills every yearsince 1977.   State Senate Majority Leader Ralph Marino said the override vote,which had been expected Tuesday, was being postponed indefinitelybecause of new cancer surgery for state Sen. James Donovan.   Donovan issued a statement saying he would enter MemorialSloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City on Monday for surgeryWednesday.   The bill's chief sponsor, state Sen. Dale Volker, had saidearlier that without Donovan's support he had almost no chance ofwinning the override test in the Senate.   Donovan, 65, who underwent surgery in early May for colon cancer,went to New York City on Wednesday for tests at Sloan-Kettering.   A consistent death penalty supporter in the past, Donovan stunnedhis colleagues last week when he said his bout with cancer hadcaused him to have second thoughts about the death penalty.   On Monday, Donovan had returned to Albany for the first timesince his May surgery and Cuomo sent a state helicopter to Donovan'shome to pick him up for a lengthy lunch at the Executive Mansion.   Emerging from that lunch, Donovan said he still wasn't certainhow he would vote on the override attempt.   But he added: ``If you were standing where I am and your life wasin danger, you would have some second thoughts.''   For the past four years, the Republican-controlled state Senatehas successfully voted to override Cuomo's death penalty vetoes butthe effort has repeatedly fallen short in the Democratic-controlledAssembly.   This year, death penalty supporters felt they were within onevote of winning in the Assembly before problems began appearing inthe Senate.   In February, state Sen. Israel Ruiz was convicted of a federalfelony that eventually cost him his seat. The Democrat had voted forthe death penalty in recent years.   With Ruiz gone, Volker could only count on 41 votes for anoverride, the exact number needed in the 61-member Senate. And thatassumed that Donovan would vote for the death penalty.   New York's electric chair hasn't been used since 1963.</TEXT></DOC>
