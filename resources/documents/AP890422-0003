Home Office Minister Timothy Renton said the panel would reportwithin a year.   ``Editors and publishers of the national press in this countryare on probation,'' Renton told the House of Commons. ``They have ayear or two to clean up their act.''   British media freedom, meanwhile, came under unprecedentedscrutiny at an international conference on Friday, spurred bycharges that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government hasundermined the public's right to know.   The announcement in Parliament came as the group of editors,publishers, broadcast executives and journalists debated news mediafreedom at a one-day seminar sponsored by the International PressInstitute.   The watchdog body, which has a membership of 2,000 publishersand editors in some 60 countries, normally focuses attention ongovernment harassment of newspapers or journalists in Third Worldcountries.   Political charges that the Conservative Party government hasundermined press freedom, and complaints about excesses by masscirculation newspapers are the two big issues in a growingcontroversy about the news media in Britain.   On the political front, editors cite a government ban onbroadcast interviews with the Irish Republican Army, far-reachingofficial secrets laws and a three-year court battle over governmentattempts to block publication of ``Spycatcher,'' a retiredintelligence agent's memoirs.   But newspapers have themselves been increasingly criticized forsensational stories that boost circulations of the major tabloids,which each sell more than a million copies a day.   ``What is disturbing is the fact that the government can getaway with this without the public caring,'' said Max Hastings,editor of London's pro-conservative Daily Telegraph.   ``The British public is disenchanted with the press. The chiefissue is how we raise our standards so that the British public willcare about the press.''   Renton announced the press review panel after a ``right ofreply'' bill foundered Friday in the Commons for lack of governmentbacking.   The bill, put forward by a rank-and-file legislator, TonyWorthington, sought to empower the government to force newspapersto publish corrections of errors.   The bill attracted considerable support from government andopposition legislators, but Renton rejected it on grounds ``itwould introduce a measure of government control over the press.''   Supporters accused the tabloids of what one called ``replacingjournalism with voyeurism.''   ``The reporter's profession has been infiltrated by a seedystream of rent boys, pimps, bimbos, spurned lovers, smear artistswith grudges, prostitutes and perjurers,'' said Jonathan Aitken, arank-and-file Conservative Party legislator. ``This is a cast ofshame.''   Apart from racy stories about the private lives of people fromTV stars to accident victims, the tabloids regularly incur thewrath of Buckingham Palace for pursuit of the royal family.   At the seminar, an American participant, Dana Bullen, directorof the Washington-based World Press Freedom Committee, contrastedBritish and American treatment of the news media.   ``Where there is an Official Secrets Act here, we have a Freedomof Information Act,'' said Bullen.   Andrew Neil, editor of London's Sunday Times, the top-sellingupmarket weekly in Britain, led complaints by editors and broadcastchiefs about government use of court orders. During the controversyover ``Spycatcher,'' national newsapers were barred at each stageby orders, called ``prior restraints,'' from publishing.   ``There is a culture in this country against the freedom of thepress because ... the government and the judges belong to the sameclub,'' said Neil, referring to the British establishment. ``Wemust have the freedom to publish and then take the consequences.''   In a series of disputes since Mrs. Thatcher won power in 1979,the government has also clashed with television networks, usuallyover features and documentaries involving the outlawed IrishRepublican Army or the intelligence services.   Also, media and civil rights groups charge that a bill to reformthe catchall 1911 Official Secrets Act is inadequate. One examplethey cite is the government's refusal to allow civil servants wholeak classfied information to argue they acted in the nationalinterest to expose a government cover-up.   Earlier Friday, a British delegate at a a meeting of 35 nationsto monitor a recent East-West accord on media freedom said theattitude of Mrs. Thatcher's government toward the media ``alarmsus.''   Neal Acherson, a columnist in the Observer, a liberal Londonweekly, said the British government tradition of organizedunattributable briefings by officials to domestic politicalcorrespondents conflicted with the East-West accord.   The accord was signed last January by the 35 nations at the endof of the Conference on European Security and Cooperation in Vienna.</TEXT></DOC>
