The dynamical behavior of the magnetizationis observed under high resolution by varying the dc field and microwavepump power. Varied behavior is found: (1) onset of the Suhl instabilityby excitation of a single spin wave mode; (2) when two or more modesare excited, interactions lead to auto-oscillations displaying period-doublingto chaos; (3) quasiperiodicity, locking, and chaos occur when three ormore modes are excited; (4) abrupt transition to wide band power spectra(i.e., turbulence), with hysteresis; (5) irregular relaxation oscillationsand aperiodic spiking behavior. A theoretical model is developed usingthe plane wave approximation obtaining the lowest order nonlinear interactionterms between the excited modes. Extension of this analysis to the truespherical spin-modes is discussed. Bifurcation behavior is examined,and dynamical behavior is numerically computed and compared to the experimentaldata. A theory is developed regarding the nature of the experimentallyobserved relaxation oscillations and spiking behavior based on the interactionof &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;strong&quot; modes, and this is demonstrated in the numericalsimulations for two modes. Quasiperiodicity is shown to occur in thenumerical study when at least 3 modes are excited with appropriate parametervalues. A possible mechanism for generating microwave subharmonics athalf of the pumping frequency is discussed. 57 refs., 25 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
