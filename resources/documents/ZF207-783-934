(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>DESKTOP PUBLISHING SOFTWAREandM;Desktop publishing has such a mixed heritage that deciding what to buy is farfrom simple.andP;  Unlike most other software, desktop publishing migrated fromApple Macintosh to the MS-DOS world.andP;  It still keeps a foot in both camps.andM;Mac owners enthusiastically welcomed Aldus Corp.'s u985 introduction ofPageMaker, along with the affordable Apple LaserWriter printer and higherscreen resolutions that banished the jaggies of early bit-mapped typefaces.andO;However, IBM PC owners were less than enthused until the Hewlett-Packard Co.andO;LaserJet printer came along.andM;Soon, other manufacturers began scrambling to improve their lumpy dotmatrixcharacters.andP;  Word processing vendors started paying attention to details likeformatting, multiple columns and text placement.andP;  After WordStar Versioni 3encountered competitors in Microsoft Word, XyWrite, Perfect Writer,WordPerfect and others, it became easy to add dropped capitals, insets andsidebars to documents.andM;Meanwhile, phototypesetter vendors like Compugraphics were finding ways tolink their machines to Macs and PCs, replacing their older optical-film-basedtechnology with lasers and also discovering PostScript.andM;The now-famous page description language from Adobe Systems Inc. was just thething for high-resolution devices.andP;  It worked well with the new office laserprinters, too.andM;Hardy HeritageandM;This &quot;sudden&quot; success had borrowed from an earlier heritage.andP;  For quite a fewyears before anyone ever heard of Apple Computer Inc. or Aldus Corp., XeroxCorp. had been marketing an upscale word processing system called the Star.andM;With landscape-style monitors showing a full readable page, a pointing deviceand a graphical user interface, the minicomputer-based Star won early favorfor high-volume word processing.andP;  Xerox actually pioneered the graphical userinterfaces, pointing devices, pull-down menus and pop-up panels so familiartoday.andM;Apple and Aldus managed to steal the office publishing market from the Star,while IBM PC-compatible makers were still quibbling over specifications forgraphics boards and monitors.andP;  The vast number of visual &quot;standards&quot; such asHercules, color graphics adapter (CGA), extended graphics adapter (EGA),video graphics array (VGA) and all their incompatible offshoots made it hardfor PC software vendors to introduce a product, much less support it.andM;That problem now seems to have stabilized, except in the 80386 PC market, sothat quality PV desktop publishing offerings appear regularly.andP;  Their costrange is enormous, running from the low hundreds into thousands of dollars,with high-end products geared to photocomposition devices rather than laserprinters.andM;The advent of reasonably priced image scanners means that even the simplestPC graphics programs now can become tools for serious publishing.andP;  Andeveryone wants to get into the act.andP;  Almost any package that can handlegraphics, print some text and arrange layouts is advertising itself as adesktop publishing package.andM;Major work processors have been adding graphics capabilities as well.andO;Graphics packages for line drawing and images always could handle text up toa point, so they to call themselves desktop publishing packages.andM;Last but not least, text formatters for output to high-resolution laserprinters have added a few page commands, imported some graphics and renamedthemselves as desktop publishing packages.andM;With such a bewildering choice, it is mandatory for buyers to give carefulthought to the quality of publishing they want to do as well as the learningtime they can invest.andM;First, decide on text manipulation needs.andP;  Most business publishing consistsof text, not pictures.andP;  Does the office already have a good, full-featuredword processor?andP;  If not, remember that publishing packages with graphicsforebears usually make feeble word processors.andP;  Even some of the high-endpackages turn heavy editing into a tooth-grinding chore.andM;Do not expect to solve all publishing problems with a single package.andP;  Foranything harder than simply wrapping some short lines of text around agraphic or two, start the job with a good, heavy-duty word processor such asMicrosoft Word 5.0, lotus Manuscript, WordPerfect 5.0 or WordStar 5.5.andM;Feature-FortifiedandM;Word processors have set their sights on capturing the desktop publishingbusiness with their rich text handling, spelling checkers, thesaurus scans,global replacements and complex macros.andP;  Many of them can import not onlyline drawings and clip art, but also scanned halftone images.andM;By and large, they accept most of the popular graphics formats, although notevery vendor's graphics Metafile or PCX file is compatible with everybodyelse's.andP;  But usually it is possible to inset a picture, line drawing or Lotus1-2-3 graph into a document, stretch it, rotate it and move it around thepage with a few keystrokes.andM;Layout is where the going gets tougher, even with preview orwhat-you-see-is-what-you-get, or WYSIWYG, capability.andP;  All the newer wordprocessors have some kind of preview mode.andP;  Some desktop publishing packagesprovide nothing more.andP;  In other words, what you see is likely what you get,but not necessarily identical.andM;Even so, with a 14-inch or bigger monitor, a Hercules or VGA graphics cardand a word processor like Word 5.0, people with good eyesight can almost readtext on the screen.andM;Like other application software, desktop publishing has collections ofprograms aimed at narrow vertical market segments.andP;  Specialty programs offerdatabase publishing of directories and catalogs; music publishing; equations;organic chemical structures; and the like.andP;  On e such package for databasepublishing is dbPublisher from Digital Composition Systems in Phoenix.andM;Vexing VisageandM;While some publishing packages run with a conventional CGA or even amonochrome monitor, screens look less than pleasing.andP;  An EGA, VGA, or eventhe old faithful Hercules adapter, coupled with at least a 14-inch diagonalmonitor, is almost mandatory.andP;  A 13-inch monitor gives a passable display,but the 14-inch is a lot easier on the eyes for type sizes below 10 points.andM;Most packages have a range of drivers for graphics adapters and monitors.andO;One package listed in the accompanying chart, BestInfo Inc.'s Wave4, requiresa special monitor and graphics adapter.andM;A mouse is indispensable for quickly selecting elements and stretching ormoving them.andP;  Many packages have pull-down menus with few or no keystrokealternatives to the mouse.andP;  Almost anything that runs with a graphical userinterface such as Windows or GEM Windows will be difficult to use without amouse.andM;Most of the high-end and mid range packages use up lots of random accessmemory and hard disk space.andP;  Many require a minimum 384K to 640K, but a fewtop packages need as much as 3M RAM on an 80286 or 80386 computer.andO;Bit-mapped images fare better in a hard-disk environment.andP;  Many publishingpackages require a hard disk.andM;Last but not least among the components comes the printer.andP;  AlthoughDot-matrix output is not top-quality, many packages support dot-matrixprinters.andP;  A 24-pin device is a must.andP;  The new ink-jet color or monochromeprinters actually rival laser printers.andM;But when most people think of desktop publishing, they think of laserprinters.andP;  The problem comes in deciding whether to spend an extra $1,000 orso for PostScript capability, or to settle for a more limited array oftypeface styles and buy extra fonts later.andM;It is a good idea to stay HP LaserJet-compatible, because every desktoppublishing package offers at least HP drivers.andP;  The more sophisticatedpackages take advantage of the many font cartridges now available for theLaserJet, and most offer downloaded fonts from vendors such as SoftCraft,SWFTE and Bitstream.andM;Users can even take a software route to PostScript output.andP;  Go-script fromLaserGo Inc., San Diego, is a $195 alternative to buying a PostScriptprinter.andP;  It does not deliver dazzling speed, but then speed was neverPostScript's strong point anyway, even with the right hardware.andP;  GoScriptwill deliver PostScript output to a plain-vanilla LaserJet printer.andM;The high-end WYSIWYG publishing packages all have a steep learning curve.andO;Prices range from $15,000 or so down to $700, with the costlier ones fullysupporting high-resolution typesetters.andP;  High-end users often prefer to seeproofs from a laser printer before they ship the output to a phototypesetter.andM;Low-end packages dip down to the $80 mark, with most of them clustered in the$100 to $200 range.andP;  Many also have WYSIWYG, wrap text around graphics,import graphics and even create fonts.andP;  The catch is that the output quality,even from a laser printer, may not be satisfactory to the discerning eye.andO;Most such packages are quite easy to learn and use.andM;Their graphics usually is restricted to drawing simple boxes, lines, circlesor ovals.andP;  But manipulation can be powerful, ranging from scaling, rotatingand cropping to applying halftone screens is varying densities.andM;Even so, desktop publishers often find they need a couple of specializedpackages to handle graphics.andP;  Older paint programs such as Z-Soft Corp.'s PCPaintbrush, upgraded for higher-resolution laser printers, can retouch andedit scanned-in halftone and line drawings.andM;Graphics packages now probably out-number desktop publishing packages.andP;  Theyrange from full-blown drafting programs costing more than $1,000 down topaint programs for less than $100.andM;For publishing graphs and charts, particularly those generated inspreadsheets and databases, consider packages like Lotus Freelance Plus orHarvard Graphics.andP;  If publishing needs include quality line illustrations butfall short of genuine drafting, then look at Adobe Illustrator, GEM Artlineand Micrografx Designer.andM;The two packages that have come to be standards in desktop publishing areXerox Ventura Publisher and Aldus PageMaker.andP;  They definitely are high-end,with Ventura listing for $895 and PageMaker for $795.andM;Packages that can drive phototypesetters, express equations and deal withcolor in a big way tend to jump the $1,000 mark and head upward.andP;  Bestinfo'sWave4 Professional Publishing System costs $4,000 to $15,000.andP;  IBM'sInterleaf Publisher version of Interleaf Inc.'s Macintosh package goes for$2,495.andM;Because word processing vendors have not yet agreed on a standard format,everyone makes a DOC file as output, but not two are the same.andP;  Most desktoppublishing vendors provide input filters for several popular word processorformats.andM;Translation UtilitiesandM;On the other side of the fence, word processing vendors also providetranslation programs from one format to another.andP;  Some come in pairs and goboth ways.andP;  The one standard everyone adheres to is the old ASCII text file,although some packages have strange interpretations of what should be in anASCII file.andM;The most popular formats are Word, WordPerfect, WordStar, MultiMate andXyWrite.andP;  Buyers should study not only these import capabilities but alsotheir own word processing export capabilities.andP;  Word processors andspreadsheets often have utility programs or export menus that convenientlyaccess translation utilities from inside the program.andM;If all else fails, there is always ASCII.andM;Some publishing packages maintain text in its original input format, so thatif extensive rewriting becomes necessary, the user can exit, call up the wordprocessor and load the file for editing.andP;  Of course, the publishing packagemay have inserted its own formatting commands into the text, so be preparedto see something that is not quite the same as what originally appeared inthe word processor.andM;Graphics file formats are a bit more standardized.andM;While many companies still have their own proprietary file formats, mostpublishing packages handle the popular Tagged-Image File Format, known asTIFF; Computer Graphics Metafile, or CGM; Data Exchange File, or DXF; andencapsulated PostScript.andM;Many also handle PCX/PCC, supported by various paint programs; Lotus 1-2-3PIC; Graphics Environment Manager, or GEM; and Hewlett-Packard GraphicsLanguage, or HPGL.andP;  Graphics packages also may provide utilities or exportfunctions between file formats.andM;Few desktop publishing packages can edit imported graphics, which is why agraphics package becomes almost as necessary an adjunct to publishing as aword processor.andP;  Users may be able to scale and rotate graphics, or even addthem to an imported image within the publishing package.andP;  Editing of theactual imported image must be done externally with the graphics program thatcreated it.andM;For page designa nd layout, all the high-end and many of the mid-range andlow-end packages follow a style sheet or template.andP;  The style sheet storesindividual layout specifications developed from standard style sheetssupplied or sold as options with the package.andM;A style sheet brings uniformity to multiple-page publications by specifyingthe treatment of margins, line spacing, rules, indents, typefaces and sizes.andO;Some word processors such as Microsoft Word also have style sheets.andM;One significant advantage is that a document produced in one layout style canbe revamped completely by attaching a different style sheet to it.andP;  Standardsytle sheets often come in both portrait and landscape orientations.andM;Third-party publishers provide extra documentation for the industry leaders,PageMaker and Ventura, in the form of how-to books and extra canned stylesheets.andP;  While all desktop publishing software comes with fairlycomprehensive documentation, much of it is written from a program designer'spoint of view and proves less than helpful to the beginner.andM;Third-party books are more likely to come from people with publishing orgraphics backgrounds and a knowledge of good design.andP;  Graphic design is anart that brings coherency, reader interest and tasteful presentation to anypublication.andM;Some of the finer points to look for in text manipulation include automaticgeneration of index and table of contents, footnotes, headers, footers,pagination, chapter numbering and automatic text flow.andM;Typographic controls such as kerning, leading and range of type sizes alsodeserve close study.andP;  Kerning adjusts the spaces between letters, whileleading adjusts spacing between lines of text.andP;  High-end publishing packagessupply kerning tables for each type style and will automatically kern certainletter pairs.andM;Some mid-range products have only manual kerning, which removes space insmall controlled increments between adjacent letters.andP;  Professionaltypesetters use kerning to tighten up loose-looking lines of text,particularly headlines.andP;  Kerning also creates what typographers callligatures joining two letters, such as a and e, in Swedish and otherlanguages.andM;Letter spacing is the opposite of kerning.andP;  It adds small amounts of spacebetween characters rather than just at word boundaries, to eliminateunsightly spaces between words in a line of justified text.andM;Many packages only have line spacing control in fractional multiples of aline, but the more sophisticated packages control leading down to one point,1/72 of an inch, or less.andM;Typographers generally agree that a good line spacing is two points above thetype size, and many packages supply such a default.andM;Thus 12-point type usually goes on a line spacing of 14 points, where spacingis a measured from the top of a character on one line to the top of acharacter in the same position on the next line.andM;The Last WordandM;Publishing packages have at least three ways to deliver text to laserprinters and some dot-matrix printers.andP;  Certain pacakges send streams ofASCII text, embedding the necessary printer control characters in the stream.andM;These control characters supply information about typefaces that come withthe printer, reside in font cartridges or are downloaded to the printer fromthe host computer.andM;Packages classed a text or page formatters and some other publishing packagestake this approach.andP;  Although the software may not state any limitations tothe point sizes, the printer certainly imposes limitations.andM;Laser printers have maximum 24- or 36-point internal font sizes; somedownloaded fonts have similar limits because of the internal memory requiredto store the font descriptions.andM;Other publishing packages deliver bit-mapped images to the printer, drivingit in graphics mode.andP;  This approach does not use the printer's typefaces, butrather the standard bit-mapped fonts that are standard or optional with thepackage.andM;Buyers should study the quality of such typefaces throughout their sizeranges.andP;  The reason is that many low-end packages generate larger fonts byscaling up from a standard outline, which causes loss of definition andjaggies in very large type.andM;However, not all scaled faces suffer from jaggies.andP;  High-end packages withbit-mapped output generally have high-quality font generators likeBitstream's Fontware, so that scaled fonts remain smooth and clean throughouttheir entire size range.andM;The third and increasingly popular way of delivering output to a printer isvia PostScript.andP;  All bit-mapped output packages supply at least Helvetica,Times Roman and Courier standard faces or their equivalents.andP;  They come innormal, bold and italic styles, with point sizes from four to 72 points orso.andM;Many packages for PostScript printing can handle as many as 35 typefaces, allof them defined in the PostScript interpreter, although standard PostScriptpackages may supply only a basic set of 13 typefaces.andM;Like laser printer vendors, some desktop publishing vendors also stretch thedefinition of typefaces to include type styles.andP;  Thus a Times Roman typefacemight be counted as three different typefaces if it comes in normal, bold anditalic versions.andM;Saul B.
