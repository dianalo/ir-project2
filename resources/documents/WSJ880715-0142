The announcement followed the traditional mid-year review of the Bundesbank's monetary target by the central bank council.    The session also was attended by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who discussed economic and monetary issues with the council. Further details on the talks weren't disclosed.    M3 money supply exceeded its 1988 target in the first five months, growing at a 7.5% annual rate. Partly to rein in monetary expansion, the central bank council two weeks ago increased its discount rate to 3% from 2.5% and its rate on securities repurchase agreements to 3.75% from 3.5%.    M3, the broadest monetary aggregate, consists of cash in circulation, sight deposits, time deposits under four years, and savings accounts. Its growth rate is measured from the average of the fourth quarter of 1987.    The Bundesbank missed its monetary goals in 1986 and 1987, when it still targeted the central bank money supply. A third year of significant overshooting might hurt the credibility of the Bundesbank's anti-inflationary stance, some observers fear.    The confirmation of the money target didn't come as a surprise to the markets, especially after Bundesbank Vice President Helmut Schlesinger indicated last week that the central bank wants to stick to this goal. </TEXT></DOC>
