The primary objectivesof the study were to determine the concentration of radon, radon daughtersand formaldehyde in single family detached houses having low naturalventilation rates, to determine the sampling frequency required to establishthe profile of air contaminants that exist in houses during the heatingseason, and to ascertain whether a more extensive survey is warranted.The main observations and conclusions are as follows. There appearedto be positive correlations between daily infiltration rates obtainedby tracer gas measurements and the square root of the indoor/outdoortemperature difference, and between infiltration rates and wind speeds.A distinct monthly variation in overall average infiltration rates isevident, showing good correlation with degree-day months and averagewind speed data. Average concentrations of indoor formaldehyde rangedfrom 0.017 to 0.058 ppM; DuPont formaldehyde dosimiters and NIOSH testswere used and comparatively evaluated. A monthly variation in the overallaverage NIOSH results was evident and coincided with monthly variationsin infiltration rates. The average radon concentration ranged from 0.3to 2.2 picocuries/l and radon daughter concentration from 0.0007 to 0.0065working levels. A monthly variation in overall average radon concentrationwas evident and also coincided with monthly variations in infiltrationrates. Average interior relative humidities did not appear to differsignificantly from house to house, and decreased rapidly from Novemberto January. Additional research is recommended. 12 refs., 15 figs., 13tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
