News yesterday that the weak accord was imminent caused world petroleum prices to plunge and contributed to a U.S. stock market rally.    Brent, the chief North Sea crude, fell $1.05 a barrel, to $16.70, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 65.82 points to 1932.86 partly on hopes that lower oil prices would keep the brakes on inflation and interest rates. The bond market also rallied on the fall in oil prices as Treasury bond prices rose for the first time since Wednesday.    Even before the six-day meeting opened, many analysts expected prices to tumble to $15 a barrel by the spring, if not sooner. Such an opinion was unanimous among those analysts informally polled here following the announcement last night of an agreement.    The internal divisiveness that caused OPEC essentially to preserve its current price and production arrangements led to the appearance of a new leadership bloc within the group that is neutral in the Persian Gulf war between Iran and Iraq.    &quot;There seems to be a firm center that voices strongly the interests of the countries outside the Gulf,&quot; Subroto, the oil minister of Indonesia, said in an interview.    Notably, the biggest losers in the agreement were Iran and the Arab states supporting Iraq, though all OPEC members would be hurt by a slide in prices.    As previously reported, the agreement would preserve OPEC's widely flouted benchmark price of $18 a barrel. In addition, current official production quotas totaling 16.6 million barrels a day would remain unchanged for the next six months, except that Iraq, which bowed out of the agreement, will have no quota at all. That leaves the ceiling for the remaining 12 members at 15.1 million barrels a day, compared with actual OPEC output, including Iraq's, of about 18.5 million barrels a day.    Because it included neither a reduction in OPEC's overall ceiling nor a strong enforcement mechanism to curb excess production, the accord failed to signal that the cartel was ready to counter the effects of brimming world-wide oil inventories and the prospect of a global economic slowdown.    &quot;This is the best agreement we could achieve in the present political circumstances of OPEC,&quot; said Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, Venezuela's oil minister. He asserted, however, that OPEC was ready &quot;to take any other decision, any other measure with the purpose to strengthen the market and to stabilize the price.&quot;    Alhaji Rilwanu Lukman, the oil minister of Nigeria and the president of OPEC, told more than 100 reporters at 1 a.m. today that he was certain Iraq wouldn't flood the market with oil despite its absence from the agreement. &quot;If they produce excessively and the market collapses, it will collapse on top of them as well as us,&quot; Mr. Lukman said.    But Iraq, which has been producing nearly double its quota of 1.5 billion barrels a day, last night pledged to produce all the oil it can -- &quot;whatever the market can take,&quot; said Ramzi Salman Abdul Hussain, Iraq's deputy oil minister, in an interview.    Added Hisham M. Nazer, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia, &quot;The fact that they (the Iraqis) are out will make the situation a little more precarious.&quot;    Meeting with a small group of reporters after the conference ended last night, Mr. Nazer nevertheless said he considers the agreement a good one. &quot;It has reaffirmed the stability of the price at $18,&quot; he said, adding that OPEC wouldn't have been following a prudent policy had it seriously considered a price increase. &quot;There are chronic problems in OPEC,&quot; he continued. He added, however, that &quot;the situation isn't caused by market forces&quot; but is caused &quot;by us.&quot;    The United Arab Emirates, OPEC's leading quota violator other than Iraq, received a severe rebuke and some moral suasion from other members. Mana Saeed Otaiba, the oil minister of the emirates, &quot;was made to realize that by weakening the market his actions have jeopardized millions of people in the Third World,&quot; said a delegate from a non-Gulf nation. &quot;He was taken aback.&quot;    All the Gulf nations in fact were taken aback at the unanimity among countries uninvolved in Persian Gulf politics. Although seven years old, the Iran-Iraq war intruded into OPEC's councils like never before because newly escalated hostilities have spread to such uninvolved nations as Kuwait, hardening Arab alliances in the region. In addition, last summer's riots at Mecca, in which hundreds of Iranian pilgrims were killed, further polarized Saudi Arabia and Iran. Saudi Arabia's Mr. Nazer, however, asserted last night that his country's objectives during the meeting were purely economic and not political.    Led by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Arab Gulf producers arrived here determined to approve a pledge by Saudi King Fahd to keep the benchmark price at $18 a barrel, an objective in which they succeeded. But encountering unusually stiff resistance from poor, non-Gulf nations, the Arab Gulf faction failed in its hard-set goal of bringing Iraq back into production compliance by awarding it a quota equal to Iran's 2.4 million barrels a day.    Several of these neutral nations were appalled at the idea of increasing the quota for Iraq, a chronic abuser, by 800,000 barrels a day, when these nations, which generally abide by their quotas, desperately need higher revenue for peaceful purposes, but would receive nothing. &quot;There is a lot of misery in our countries,&quot; one oil minister explained.    Iraq's war foe, Iran, also lost big. The Iranian oil minister came here with orders to secure a benchmark price of at least $20 a barrel at any cost, and in the end said he could sign only after flying back to Tehran to obtain the blessings of his government. Though vanquished in its effort to increase prices, the Iranian delegation was not anxious to join Iraq in fleeing from the agreement into self-imposed isolation at a time when the warring nation counts so few friends in the Arab and non-Arab worlds.    Iran's prior refusal to sign any agreement without a price increase, even in the face of a soft oil market, apparently began to alienate even its traditional supporters of Libya and Algeria, who joined Gabon and Ecuador in moving toward the newly created center within the organization. The core of that centrist group consisted of three neutral, non-Arab nations -- Indonesia, Venezuela and Nigeria -- all of which were disturbed by the feuding and what they viewed as strong-arm tactics by the Gulf Arab states. In fact, the oil ministers of the three countries, who became known to some delegates as the &quot;three wise men,&quot; acted as intermediaries as the Gulf war threatened to block the achievement of any agreement at all.    &quot;I must say this conference is one of the most difficult conferences I have ever attended,&quot; said Indonesia's Mr. Subroto, an experience he attributed to &quot;the fallout from the tensions of the Gulf war.&quot;    This new bloc of OPEC members, should it hold together, could demand that OPEC rise above Persian Gulf political problems, should they persist until OPEC holds its next regularly scheduled meeting here in June. Although these countries are economically weak and don't own nearly as much oil reserves of the Gulf nations, their number -- seven -- represents a one-vote majority in the organization, all of whose members have one vote each. </TEXT></DOC>
