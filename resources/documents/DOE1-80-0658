Thisreport covers a programme to produce materials based upon commerciallyavailable lead-telluride-type material (specifically identified as 3P)with improved figures of merit and hence greater thermoelectric-conversionefficiency. One way of improving the figure of merit is by reducing thelattice thermal conductivity of the material in order to increase phonon-grainboundary scattering. A realistic model was developed for PbSnTe and usedto investigate the dependence of the lattice thermal conductivity ongrain size and level doping. Thermal diffusivity measurements on smallgain size compacted 3P material indicate that the reduction in latticethermal conductivity is more than double that predicted by the theoreticalmodel and is comparable to the reduction reported for silicon-germaniumalloys. The measured electric power-factor values do not appear to decreasewith a reduction in grain or size.</TEXT></DOC>
