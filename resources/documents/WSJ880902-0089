But barring a general settlement, the long-simmering fight over Washington Public Power Supply System's disastrous $2.25 billion default in 1983 will come to a boil Sept. 7 in the federal courthouse here.    As befits a case centered on the nation's largest-ever municipal default, the scope of the proceedings is expansive. Dozens of lawyers from across the country will sift through millions of pages of testimony and evidence for the nine to 15 months the trial is expected to run. And to help expedite matters, the court is counting on some unusual technological and legal strategies, including an oversize jury panel.    Allowing for the expected appeals to higher courts, it's likely to be years before more than 24,000 WPPSS bond buyers find out how much they will recoup.    But the action has already begun for Tucson, where the case was moved after Seattle-based federal judges recused themselves for fear of perceived conflicts of interest, and after it was decided that an impartial jury couldn't be found in Washington state. Tucson newspapers now carry details of pretrial maneuvering, and the clerk at a Days Inn across from the courthouse talks gleefully of extra business.    Jests one visiting lawyer, &quot;It's almost as good as having the Olympics in town.&quot;    On Wednesday, WPPSS itself reached a tentative settlement with plaintiffs, to be submitted to the court here. However, the trial won't be affected; WPPSS in some ways has been a rather minor defendant in terms of recovery, because others named in the litigation have more money. While the tentative settlement doesn't call for plaintiffs to get any cash, WPPSS agreed, among other things, not to contest the eventual payment of money into an account that might be created for use in reimbursing claimants.    For their part, the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss their securities-fraud and other claims against WPPSS. (Further pretrial settlements aren't expected, although the presiding judge, 57-year-old William D. Browning, has barred public discussion of any negotiations to that end.)    Because of its complexity and location, the trial is expected to break new technical ground in the federal court system. Unless the approach is overturned on appeal by the defendants, the first federal-court transmission of live testimony by satellite will be employed. It's a step designed to get around potential subpoena limitations by enabling lawyers to examine Seattle witnesses from here. Also planned is the use of videotaping -- widely accepted in state courts but a first for the federal system. Four stationary cameras will record the trial, with tapes then available only to Judge Browning and the lawyers.    Special arrangements also will allow court reporters to produce transcripts twice a day, both in print and on computer disks. Generally, transcripts are released every few days or, at most, daily.    Even the jury will be unusual. Twenty panel members -- more than in most federal cases -- will be culled from hundreds of candidates. And to keep a full jury available in case of a high number of dropouts, all 20 will sit through the trial without knowing which of them will finally vote. The court hasn't set an exact number of voting jurors, but it will be six or more.    The case in question, known as Multi-District Litigation 551, is a thicket of claims and counterclaims rooted in the financial rubble of two unfinished nuclear plants. The shells of WPPSS projects No. 4 and No. 5, each less than a quarter completed, are among the remnants of an ill-fated 1970s plan to build five reactors in Washington state under the direction of WPPSS, a state agency controlled in turn by a score of municipally owned electric-utility districts. The plan proved so misguided that WPPSS became widely known as &quot;Whoops.&quot;    Only one of the five projected plants, No. 2, is operating. That facility, along with unfinished Nos. 1 and 3, was in effect underwritten by the Bonneville Power Authority, a federal agency.    But under separate financial arrangements, the bonds for Nos. 4 and 5 were putatively backed only by the pledge of 88 municipal utilities and cooperatives, among them such tiny entities as the city of Drain, Ore., and the Cowlitz County (Wash.) Public Utility District. The pledge, which included a power-purchase agreement, proved to be a fragile one.    In 1982, after WPPSS's power projections proved vastly overstated, the agency halted work on Nos. 4 and 5. However, through 14 bond issues, some $2.25 billion had already been borrowed and allocated for their construction.    WPPSS teetered on the edge of default until June 1983, when the Washington state Supreme Court ruled that many of the 88 participants in Nos. 4 and 5 -- representing 68% of the obligations -- hadn't the legal authority to execute their contracts with the project, and thus didn't have to make good on the debt. Soon thereafter, WPPSS told the bond trustee, Chemical Bank, that it couldn't repay the debt, thereby defaulting. In November 1984, the court excused the remaining participants from their obligations.    MDL 551, a consolidation of claims filed in courts from Seattle to New York, is widely considered the most important of the cascade of state and federal lawsuits that followed. It comprises two basic plaintiff groups: Chemical Bank, which as trustee is seeking recovery on behalf of all current bondholders; and, as a class, those individuals and corporations that purchased bonds during a certain period, although they may no longer be holders. (Other suits outstanding include a case in Washington state court alleging that the state itself is liable for the losses, and a state-court securities-fraud case awaiting appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.)    The defendants include utilities representing about 65% of the participation in the projects; the projects' financial adviser, a company now part of PaineWebber Inc.; R.W. Beck andamp; Associates, Seattle-based consulting engineers; and two construction engineers: United Engineers andamp; Constructors Inc. of Philadelphia and Ebasco Services International of New York.    Chemical Bank and the bond buyers allege, among other things, that the defendants violated state and federal securities laws, and undertook massive fraud and misrepresentation in selling the bonds, as well as in describing the cost of the plants and the need for their output. They also claim the defendants knew that WPPSS couldn't force participants to make good on the debt, and that it was impossible to raise enough money to cover the projects' spiraling costs in a market saturated with WPPSS bonds.    According to WPPSS and the participants, there was neither fraud nor breach of securities laws. The utilities say they relied on the advice of outside consultants, that they made all necessary disclosures in a timely way and that, in any case, WPPSS's financial woes were well known for years before the final collapse.    However, the defendants apparently face an uphill battle in parts of the case. In a technical ruling last month, for example, Judge Browning noted that evidence indicates possible collusion to misrepresent or cover up both doubts about the participants' ability and willingness to pay, and risks that the market was already so saturated with WPPSS bonds that the projects never could be completed.    Fears of a long legal battle -- and the threat of losing -- have already compelled settlement by a half dozen defendant groups. They include bond underwriters, bond counsel and some of the smaller participating utilities, who have agreed to pay a total of $330 million and face the prospect of $60 million or so more in insurance coverage assigned to the plaintiffs. (There also remains about $100 million of bond proceeds that weren't spent by WPPSS and were retained by Chemical Bank.)    For the other parties, though, high noon approaches in this old Wild West capital. And Judge Browning has let it be known that verbal side arms must be checked at the courtroom door. In a detailed, 17-page protocol, he warns that &quot;sarcasm, disparaging comments or remarks indicating personal animosity, ill will or acrimony will not be tolerated.&quot;    ---               The Long Road to the Courtroom   July 14, 1976 -- Eighty-eight utilities in northwestern states formally agree to finance and build two nuclear gnerating stations designated WPPSS Projects 4 and 5.
