Sun on precision flying shows:   The show went on at the Canadian International Air Show ... aftertwo Canadian fighter jets touched and tumbled into Lake Ontario,killing Capt. Shane Antaya and injuring his commander, Maj. DanDempsey. Captain Antaya was only 24 years old.   It's time for the show to stop.   Precision flying shows perform three positive functions. Theyhelp recruiters interest young people in military flying. Theyprovide cheap, usually free, thrills to millions of onlookers. Andthey provide work for the people who must build another jet eachtime one crashes. ...   The young men who die in these crashes are told that they areserving their country. ...   A moment of reflection of that concept uncovers the deception ofit. Their lives are serving the public relations needs of a giantdefense industry that has been on a relentless feeding frenzy sinceWorld War II. Their lost lives are about as useful as a 60-secondspot during the Super Bowl.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 11   The News-Leader, Springfield, Mo., on South African elections:   It's hard to find reason for hope in South Africa, but recentnational elections may shine a sliver of light for the future of theminority white government.   Gains by the anti-apartheid forces on the left were partiallyoffset by gains on the racist right. Both gained strength at theexpense of the majority party in the center.   What that could mean for the future isn't certain. It suggeststhat South African whites are becoming more polarized. But that maybe the only way to force the Afrikaner majority to abandon thestupidity of apartheid, grant blacks a voice in the future, andrejoin the civilized world.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 12   Wilkes-Barre (Pa.) Times Leader on communism:   So far, it's been a lousy year for communism.   There has been widespread revolt against the Red Menace inPoland, which in January elected its first non-Communist governmentin about 40 years.   In China last June, about a million students and workers spentweeks protesting Communist domination in their country _ a rebellionthat wouldn't quit until the army, on orders from the government,moved in with tanks and bullets.   Not long ago, the people of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania startedturning up the heat in their quest to rid themselves of Sovietdomination.   And on Monday came the latest slap in the face to thepowerbrokers of communism, when 7,000 East Germans fled to freedom.   Incredibly, they were able to do so because another Communistcountry, Hungary, agreed to their passage to Austria and,eventually, West Germany. ...   What has prompted this welcome trend? And why now, all of asudden? As we see it, several factors are responsible. For onething, communism has not delivered on its promises. Instead ofprosperity in its host nations, it has brought economic decline.Instead of spreading happiness, it has brought grief. Instead ofgaining respect for its followers worldwide, it has brought themshame.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 10   Roswell (N.M.) Daily Record on illegal aliens in the census count:   Since the first nationwide count in 1790, the Census Bureau hastallied the entire population of the United States, as theConstitution specifies, without regard to individuals' residencystatus.   But there is now a move on Capitol Hill to disregard illegalimmigrants in the 1990 tally.   The intent of this effort, led by a number of Southern senatorsand representatives, is to dilute the congressional representationof states such as Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, New Mexicoand Texas, whose populations include large numbers of undocumentedaliens.   The head count is required by the Constitution every 10 years toapportion seats in the House of Representatives. Because the totalnumber of House seats remains constant at 435, states withfast-growing populations pick up additional seats at the expense ofstates where the growth rate is below average.   Lawmakers should read the Constitution, including the 14thAmendment, which uses the word ``persons'' as opposed to``citizens'' in determining electoral apportionment.   Every census in the past 200 years has counted all persons. To dootherwise would pretend that literally millions of residents in ourmidst simply don't count.</TEXT><NOTE>End Editorial Rdp</NOTE></DOC>
