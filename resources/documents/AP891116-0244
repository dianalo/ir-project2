Inspection instructions, work manuals and attendance reportswere things he never had to deal with before. Now he even isinvolved in hiring new staff for his production team.   Not that he regrets the extra work.   ``It's fun to have a job with responsibility,'' said Melzig, 23,who is a leader of a six-man team building Saab's upscale passengercars. ``Assembling cars is now a good job.''   Melzig is one of the workers in Saab-Scania AB's new Malmofactory, which takes innovative Swedish manufacturing laborpractices a step further in reducing mind-numbing drudgery andincreasing worker responsibility for such areas as quality controland day-to-day management.   ``You can't build a first-class car with workers whom youconsider to have second-class jobs,'' says Henry Selenius, theplant's general manager.   In labor-starved Sweden, industries must compete to attract andkeep workers. With an unemployment rate of just 1.5 percent,laborers can pick and choose their workplace.   The assembly line is gone at Saab's new $150 million plant.Replacing it is what the company calls ``parallel assembly,'' orautonomous work teams of up to 10 people who assemble a larger partof the unit and do their own quality control.   Each team, equipped with a personal computer, plans its dailywork ration and orders the materials it needs. It also draws up arotation of jobs within the group and files reports comparingresults with management's targets.   Workers _ here they're called ``car-builders'' _ start their daywith a company-provided breakfast, followed by a team planningsession against a backdrop of tropical flowers and water ponds.   The Saab factory is light and spacious, with walls and equipmentin matching colors and a cubistic net of shimmering pipes on theceiling.   Escalators have replaced stairways. A chessboard is painted onthe floor of the rest area and it's not unusual to find workersplaying with king-sized chess pieces during their lunch hour.   There's also a grocery store and the top-floor restaurantcommands a view over the Oresund sound between Sweden and Denmark.A company doctor offers specialist treatment for back strain, whichis the scourge of many factories.   In another innovation, the work team is responsible forcomputer-controlled quality tests before sending the car to itsnext assembly station.   ``Our goal is that the car-builders themselves should be able tocorrect any defects and in future use their experience to assistthe engineers ... in changing the construction to eliminateentirely the source of the defect,'' Selenius said.   Some of Sweden's largest companies began dismantling thestandard assembly lines in the early 1970s, freeing workers fromthe repetitive single-task work day.   When Saab took down the line in 1972 at its gasoline engineplant, production costs increased but the company claimed itsemployees did higher quality work, Selenius said.   Other factories were slow to follow, said Stig Marklund, of theMetal Workers' Confederation. But now the practice is becoming morecommon, he said, citing such companies as Alfa Laval AB and carmaker Volvo AB among the converted.   Marklund said other European manufacturers, facing a long-termdecline in the size of their work force, had expressed interest inthe Swedish concept.   Under Sweden's welfare laws, all workers get a minimum annualfive-week holiday and overtime may be compensated in extra timeoff, which many workers prefer to highly taxed cash payments.   Mothers or fathers are guaranteed 15 months of parental leaveafter the arrival of a newborn. Paid sick leave can apply also forthose who stay home to care for a sick child or aged parent. Unpaidstudy-leave of up to a year is available without risk of losing ajob.   One result of the system is chronic absenteeism. Saab's rate hasbeen as high as 25 percent, but Selenius said the first threemonths in Malmo showed an 8 percent decrease in absenteeism.   Saab also wants to revamp the salary system, which is strictlycontrolled by union contracts, to give greater flexibility and morereward for experience and merit. Monthly salaries are average forthe sector, starting at the equivalent of $1,613, or about $937after tax.</TEXT></DOC>
