If so, a disproportionate number of the vanquishedghosts were lawyers.   A war fought to restore the international rule of law byejecting the occupiers of Kuwait also restored the rule ofthe Constitution at home. A review of the domestic battleplans shows how Mr. Bush deftly deployed legal argumentsbacked by political force to prevail over congressionalclaims that he lacked power to make war. In the process, therevisionist idea that Congress runs wars has imploded into somuch Scud shrapnel.</LP><TEXT>   The received wisdom after Vietnam taught that presidentsmust no longer have the discretion to commit troops. Thisbeing the U.S., the straitjacket was not political or moral,but purely &quot;legal&quot; -- the War Powers Resolution. It's notwidely understood, but Mr. Bush violated this law back inAugust when he sent troops to Saudi Arabia without firstconsulting Congress. This is because the resolution claimedthat without congressional approval, presidents can dispatchtroops on their own only to defend U.S. territory or armedforces, neither of which was threatened.   Burying the War Powers Resolution was only the first stepto regaining the constitutional powers previous presidentsused to order U.S. force abroad more than 200 times in asmany years. After Mr. Bush decided to send an additional150,000 troops to the region in November to prepare toliberate Kuwait, he gave congressmen visiting the White Housemore bad news. When some claimed that only Congress couldauthorize such a large deployment, he pulled a copy of theConstitution out of his suit pocket. True, only Congress can&quot;declare&quot; war, Mr. Bush said, but &quot;It also says I'm thecommander in chief.&quot;   As the nation's chief diplomat, Mr. Bush also persuadedthe United Nations to pass resolutions authorizing the use offorce two months before Congress got around to voting. Hedispatched Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to tell Sen. SamNunn's anti-war hearings that Mr. Bush had all theconstitutional authority he needed to launch a battle;Secretary of State James Baker promised only to &quot;consult&quot;with leading members of Congress before the first bombsburst. We now know that Gen. Colin Powell and his aides werealready planning to liberate Kuwait with massive forcesencircling Iraqi troops.   It was at this point that a group of liberal congressmenfiled a lawsuit to block any &quot;offensive&quot; use of troopswithout prior congressional authorization. The argument wasthat even if Mr. Bush had the constitutional power to orderthe initial deployment, the power to declare war meant thatCongress had to approve any larger-scale deployment. But theConstitution does not distinguish between defensivedeployments and larger-scale offensive deployments. (If itdid, the Founders presumably would have preferred theWestmoreland incrementalist war to the Schwarzkopfget-the-job-done war.) Federal Judge Harold Greene dismissedthe lawsuit by saying the issue wasn't ripe for a court, butin nonbinding parts of his opinion also accepted theunprecedented argument that Congress must act before troopsattack.   By mid-January, Mr. Bush made clear that he was going touse force if necessary to free Kuwait. If Congress wanted toapprove his decision, fine, but either way he seemed to say,the die was cast. Several congressmen proposed a resolutiondemanding economic sanctions alone with no use of force. Rep.Richard Gephardt proposed using Congress's clearconstitutional power of the purse to cut off funds to blockan attack. The resolution that finally passed (by thepartisan 52 to 47 in the Senate) approved the use of forcewhile noting that only Congress can &quot;declare&quot; warwhichCongress did not do.   In the process Mr. Bush created a new constitutionalprinciple: If a president dispatches troops against adictator, tells Congress he's going to order them to battleregardless of what Congress does or fails to do, thenCongress will pass a resolution approving what the presidentalready said he was going to do anyway.   After the vote, Mr. Bush made it clear that he appreciatedCongress's vote as a signal to Saddam that the country wasunited, but that it didn't much matter as a constitutionalpoint. &quot;As I made clear to congressional leaders at theoutset,&quot; Mr. Bush wrote in his signing statement, &quot;my requestfor congressional support did not, and my signing thisresolution does not, constitute any change in thelongstanding positions of the executive branch on either thepresident's constitutional authority to use the armed forcesto defend vital U.S. interests or the constitutionality ofthe War Powers Resolution.&quot;   If the Vietnam/War Powers Resolution/Watergate specter istruly gone, the next time a president feels obliged to deployU.S. troops his first test won't be running theconstitutional gauntlet at home. We are now back to where wewere when Jefferson dispatched forces to rout the Barbarypirates, when FDR transferred warships to Britain beforeWorld War II despite neutrality laws and when Truman sent thetroops to Korea. The Constitution gives presidents theauthority to act first, consult Congress later. This is whywe've had only five declared wars, with only the War of 1812and Spanish-American War preceded by a debate in Congress onwhether to fight.   It's important to note that the two branches are&quot;co-equal,&quot; but in foreign affairs their powers are notidentical. The Persian Gulf War is a reminder that 535members of Congress can't possibly command troops to victory.This is why at the Constitutional Convention the Founderschanged the original proposed language in order to giveCongress the power to declare war instead of to make war -- apower they gave to the president.   At the same time, Congress always has the last word, whichis why as a political matter it's often wise to forceCongress to vote as early as possible on a deployment. IfCongress decides a war is unwise it can withdraw funding, asit eventually did in Vietnam. It's worth noting, however,that in its zeal to solicit other countries to pay for ourtroops, Congress this time delegated its power of the purse.   This distribution of power under the Constitution reflectsthe Founders' understanding that accountability is the key toconstitutional democracy. It's a political truism that onlypresidents are ever elected for their foreign-policy views.Indeed, far from holding them accountable, it's considereddirty pool even to remind voters of the congressmen who votedthat economic sanctions would succeed against a regime thatgouged out the eyes of Kuwaitis, beat up POWs and torched oilwells.   Congress often tries to micromanage most in the area --foreign policy -- in which voters are least able to hold itsmembers responsible. Mr. Bush risked his presidency on thiswar. In the process he won a victory at home for his office,the Constitution and accountable government.</TEXT></DOC>
