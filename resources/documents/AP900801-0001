In another development, the captain and helmsman of a Greektanker whose collision with two barges caused the spill blamed theaccident on a state pilot at a federal hearing.   And federal officials approved the use of oil-eating microbes tohelp clean up the spill, which threatens birds and other wildlifein nesting grounds around the bay.   The Greek tanker Shinoussa collided Saturday with two of threebarges towed by the tug Chandy N in the Houston Ship Channel, whichpasses through the bay. Heavy black oil spewed from the bargesuntil Tuesday. The double-hulled tanker didn't leak.   The state Health Department banned fishing as of midnightWednesday because the spill presents a health threat, according toNeil Travis, chief of the agency's consumer health protectionbureau in Austin.   ``It's as much a precautionary measure as anything else,''Travis said, adding that officials grew concerned after seeingshrimpers pull trawls through an oil slick. Some oil-tainted shrimphave been caught.   The indefinite ban for all of Galveston Bay and connectingwaters covers all aquatic organisms, including fish, crabs, oystersand shrimp, said biologist Don Pitts of the state Parks andWildlife Department, which will enforce the ban.   ``Everybody's just kind of taken by surprise,'' said JohnCollins, secretary of the Texas Live Bait Dealers Association.``There's really not too much you can say _ just do it. It's forpeople's health.''   Coast Guard officials said less of the 17-mile slick was visibleWednesday, indicating the oil either had begun dissipating or hadsunk.   But environmentalists said if the oil has reached the baysbottom, it may present an even more serious threat to wildlife.   ``I think it's a worse situation than if it was floating on thesurface,'' said Larry McKinney of the state Parks and WildlifeDepartment. He said oil on the bottom could kill small aquaticlife, breaking a crucial link in the food chain.   The bay is protected from the Gulf of Mexico by barrier islandsthat contain nesting grounds for dozens of species of birds andother wildlife. Environmentalists fear that the proximity of theislands and the oil's thickness would make it difficult todissipate.   Two seabirds have died and oily birds were spotted, but therewere no new reports of dead wildlife.   Cleanup crews used six skimmer vessels and a vacuum truck toscoop up the oil, which already has tainted several beaches aroundthe bay. More than 50,000 gallons of oil had been retrieved byWednesday, Coast Guard officials said.   Salvage crews slid a sling under the crippled barge to helprefloat it, said Coast Guard spokesman Dennis Schaefer.   The tanker's captain and helmsman testified at the openingsession of a hearing by the Coast Guard and the NationalTransportation Safety Board.   Capt. Nikolos Fioratos of Greece and helmsman Mohammad S. Haque,33, of Bangladesh claimed pilot Raymond Fincher of the HoustonPilots Association misdirected the Shinoussa into the path of thebarges.   Haque said the Shinoussa, headed out to the Gulf of Mexico, hadbeen traveling alongside a Liberian tanker headed into the shipchannel just before the accident occurred. The barges also wereheading in, behind the Liberian ship Hellespont Faith.   Fioratos, 44, said he thought Fincher had been directing thetanker to travel too fast _ at 14 knots _ and too close to theLiberian ship.   ``It was very close _ my estimate is about 10 meters,'' Fioratossaid. ``We almost greeted the other ship by hand.''   Fioratos said he didn't express his concerns because he didn'twant to make trouble for his crew.   Haque said the pilot ordered him to go left, then quicklyordered him to go right after realizing the tanker was headed forthe barges.   Haque said he responded immediately, but it was too late. Theexperienced helmsman hadn't steered through the channel before.   Fincher, who has yet to testify, disputed Haque's account. ``Heput the rudder the wrong way at a critical time,'' the pilot said.   A home video shot by a Timothy Hanes, of Spring, who was on asailboat during the accident, could provide some answers, officialssaid.   Hanes said the Shinoussa passed a vessel on the left, thencollided with the Apex Towing Co. barges.   Hanes is to testify and the videotape is to be aired during thethree-day hearing.   A federal-state task force said oil-eating microbes could bespread Thursday on the spill, which extends in patches for 17 miles.   In a process called bioremediation, the microbes convert the oilinto a fatty substance fish can eat.   The Coast Guard continued to direct traffic through the channel,opening one lane at a time. The shipping disruption costs about$1.5 million a day, said Ted Thorjunssen, president of the WestGulf Maritime Association.</TEXT></DOC>
