Ross Perot. General Motors Corp.'s chairman might be faulted for not handling their relationship more deftly to prevent a big blowup. But the increasingly public feud between the two men was becoming distracting and disruptive to people at all levels of GM and Electronic Data Systems Corp., the subsidiary that Mr. Perot founded.    In short, somebody had to go. &quot;The issue before the board was that there can be only one chief executive officer,&quot; a top-level GM executive said Monday, &quot;and not two.&quot;    Another issue, however, is just what skills and methods GM needs at the top right now. This isn't meant to be the gratuitous &quot;Roger-bashing&quot; that has become popular around Detroit lately -- even among people who were hailing Mr. Smith as an industrial visionary just a year ago. But like any man, the 61-year-old Mr. Smith has his strengths and weaknesses.    Mr. Perot addressed those last May in an interview about GM's situation and Mr. Smith's leadership. &quot;What you've got here is a numbers guy, and what we've got is a people problem,&quot; he said. &quot;But let me defend him for a minute. This is the way he's been brought up.&quot;    Mr. Smith's biggest strength is brains. His work so fast that, in interviews, he often doesn't complete his sentences, because his mind moves on to his next thought faster than his mouth completes the thought he's finishing.    What's more, Mr. Smith can be appealingly unassuming for the head of the largest company on earth. In an interview last April he was looking for a document he wanted to use to make a point, but he couldn't immediately find it. Instead of summoning one of his secretaries, Mr. Smith walked over to a cabinet, got down on his hands and knees, and started rummaging until he found what he wanted.    Another example: Eighteen months ago, one of my wife's out-of-town friends told her that a Detroiter had a cottage next to theirs on a lake in northern Michigan. The guy's name was Roger Smith, she said, and he worked for a car company, but she didn't know just which company or just what he did. That was an easy hunch to follow, and it led to the obvious answers. Mr. Smith certainly doesn't wear who he is on his sleeve.    But Roger Smith has spent 37 years in GM's financial ranks, the traditional grooming ground for the company's chairmen. By training and temperament he thinks of GM's problems -- and their solutions -- in terms of money.    That's apparent in his programs to make GM the world's premier auto maker once again. He spent over $7.5 billion to buy Electronic Data and Hughes Aircraft Co. -- the former to handle data processing, the latter to provide diversification and new technology for cars. The company planned to spend $5 billion to launch Saturn Corp., the project to develop innovative ways to make and sell cars. GM became the dominant U.S. robot concern by forming a venture with Fujitsu Fanuc Ltd. of Japan. It spent further billions to build &quot;factories of the future&quot; that wouldn't need forklift operators, windshield installers or tire mounters. Mr. Smith said GM was investing for the future, instead of playing for the short term.    But most of the workers who did the automated tasks stayed on the payroll, and many found themselves idle. Slumping orders forced layoffs at Hughes and GM-Fanuc Robotics. &quot;That's what happened to GM,&quot; says a top-level GM executive. &quot;We spent all this extra money, and didn't get any extra productivity.&quot; That realization is what prompted the sharp budget cuts at Saturn earlier this year.    In fact, the only GM experiment that has really worked well is the least expensive one: New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., the venture with Toyota Motor Corp. that produces cars at a once-abandoned GM factory near San Francisco.    The NUMMI plant, managed by Toyota and staffed by a once-unruly GM work force, has had the highest quality and efficiency ratings of any plant in the GM system. It isn't a high-tech plant. But Toyota managers -- much like good school teachers -- are adept at creatively using peer pressure to get employees interested and involved in their work. Abolishing executive dining rooms and parking places may be only symbolic, but symbols can mean a lot.    The lesson isn't lost on Ross Perot. &quot;That Toyota plant has 20-year-old equipment, but it produces the highest quality for us,&quot; he said in the May interview. &quot;The first thing you do going into battle is that you feed the troops first and feed the officers second. We've got to be much better listeners to the people who are doing the work.&quot;    Back in 1982, in the midst of the auto industry's depression, GM unveiled a plan to make it easier for 6,000 senior officials to earn bonuses on the same day the company signed a contract getting concessions from the United Auto Workers. Mr. Smith hasn't repeated that faux pas. But last year the bonuses for GM's top-salaried employees stayed about the same level as in 1984, while profit-sharing for GM rank-and-file workers went down sharply. It's an emotional issue on the assembly lines that could well help produce a strike at GM when the company's three-year labor contract expires next fall.    Mr. Smith may resolve GM's current woes. But he's more likely to do it by using some of Mr. Perot's ideas than by simply throwing money at the problems. If money alone was the answer, GM wouldn't have problems in the first place.    ---   Mr. Ingrassia is the Journal's Detroit bureau chief. </TEXT></DOC>
