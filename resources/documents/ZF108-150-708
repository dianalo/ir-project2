&quot; I told himthe problem with my travel schedule.andP;  Gerard rooted around his desk for awhile and came up with Pan Overseas' Prescript, a software interpreter thatintercepts Postscript printer output and converts it into Laserjet commands.andO;He also dug up a pair of boards that plug into the PC and the Laserjet andtransfer data at video rates.andP;  Frankly, I didn't care one way or the other.andO;I'd be thrilled if we could just get a page out before dawn on Thursday.andM;GLOOMY FOREBODINGSandM;Home I headed, weighed down by 20 pounds of hardware and software.andP;  I readthe documentation on the train.andP;  As I did so, my hopes sank lower and lower.andO;Prescript is a protected-mode TSR that loads in extended memory.andP;  ButWindows/386 takes over much of the machine when it runs.andP;  I was sure they'dconflict.andP;  Meanwhile, the Designer manual said that I needed to replace anumber of Windows drivers with more-recent ones from Micrografx in order toavoid lockups and incompatibilities.andP;  Changing drivers in Windows requiresreinstallation.andP;  That was fine, except that I didn't have the Windows/386disks at home, so I couldn't reinstall it.andM;When I arrived, I told Stephanie not to expect anything and got to work.andP;  Thedisappointment in her eyes was a haunting reminder of the risks involved ingetting new things to work for the first time.andP;  I installed Designer first,figuring that if I couldn't get to the clip art or hack together some kind ofdesign that suggested Treasured Moments, I'd quit right there and salvagewhat I could of the evening.andP;  Contrary to all the dire warnings, bothDesigner and the clipart disks worked fine with my old drivers, andMicrografx's Postscript driver didn't require a reinstallation of Windows.andO;Then I installed Prescript.andP;  It, too, went in without a hitch.andP;  I was tickledwhen the test page emerged from the Laserjet.andM;So it was time for the big risk.andP;  With Prescript still loaded in extendedmemory, I started Windows/386.andP;  Which, of course, died, averring that themachine had insufficient memory.andP;  Sure, I can see how 6 megabytes isn'tenough to hold Windows and Prescript.andP;  I rebooted the machine, figuring thata fresh start might do the trick.andP;  It didn't.andM;Clearly, I needed to reinstall Windows/ 386.andP;  Except that reinstallationwasn't an option.andP;  So I did the next best thing.andP;  I ran WIN86.COM, whichloads a single realmode copy of Windows.andP;  It warned me that I had changed themachine's memory configuration and that I should reinstall Windows, but thatwas old news.andP;  At least it worked.andM;Next, I ran Designer.andP;  Instead of the 4 megabytes or so that I was used tohaving under Windows 1386, Designer could scrape up only about 200K in whichto manage its overlays and the graphic image.andP;  I hadn't seen an applicationrun so slowly since I retired my old XT.andP;  The disk drive light came on andstayed on almost the entire time, as Designer and Windows swapped stuff inand out of memory.andM;But, amazingly, Prescript worked exactly as advertised.andP;  I was rewarded witha couple of beautiful images and an ecstatic 8-year-old.andP;  Despite Designer'sslow performance in its hampered mode, Prescript printed the images quicklyand without difficulty.andM;After the smoke cleared, I began to wonder if I had not, in fact, wasted thewhole evening.andP;  After all, didn't Designer have a PCL driver for theLaserjet? So I disabled Prescript and printed the image (a dense one) usingthe PCL driver.andP;  Twenty minutes later, a page finally emerged.andP;  The image wasnoticeably lower in quality and the typography was a complete mess.andP;  You canbet I'll be doing a complete reinstallation of Windows/386 and Prescript.andO;The right tools are worth it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
