Researchers who studied 516 Colorado uranium miners who hadnever smoked cigarettes, pipes or cigars, found that 14 had died oflung cancer between 1950 and 1984, a lung cancer death rate 12.7percent higher than for a comparison group of non-smoking veterans,the study found.   Radon, a radioactive decay product of uranium, is a colorless,odorless gas that can build up in closed areas such as mines andhouses, said Robert Roscoe, an epidemiologist at the NationalInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health in Cincinnati and oneof the researchers.   ``These results confirm that exposure to radon (and relatedradioactve decay products of uranium) in the absence of cigarettesmoking is a potent carcinogen that should be strictlycontrolled,'' the researchers wrote.   The uranium miners in the study worked an average of 14.6 yearsin the mine.   Federal law today is much more restrictive on how long uraniumminers can be exposed to radiation, compared with the 1950s, saidVicto Archer, an epidemiologist who has studied the history ofuranium miners.   ``Today, uranium miners do not experience radiation levelsanywhere near like the miners of the past,'' Roscoe said.   Previous studies of radon and miners examined those who hadalready died of lung cancer and questioned friends and relativesabout the miners' smoking habits, Roscoe said. This study selecteda group of miners who said they never had smoked and followed themfor three decades.   ``It took this long to finish the study because lung cancer israre and we had to wait for miners to die,'' Waxweiler said.``Because we keep track of them for years and recorded their habitswhen they were alive, we think our study is more accurate.''   Uranium decays into radium, a radioactive element, Waxweilersaid. Radium further decays into radon gas, which moves through thesoil without combining with other gases.   The damage from radon occurs as the gas decays, turning backinto a solid, Waxweiler said. Inhaled through the nose or mouth,the solid particles become ``little short-range machine guns'' thatfire off radioactive, cancer-causing particles, he said.   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency warns that children canbe especially harmed by radon, because they spend more time at homethan adults.   ``We've been recommending testing for radon from the beginningof time,'' said EPA spokeswoman Martha Casey in Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
