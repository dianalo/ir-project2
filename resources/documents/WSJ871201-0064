Employees who participate in the program will go on &quot;inactive status&quot; Jan. 1 and receive their regular salary and most benefits during 1988. They then will retire Jan. 1, 1989.    The response to the program will determine the extent of cost-cutting moves to be made in the first quarter of 1988, the company said. Hartford Insurance, which has 20,000 employees nationwide, imposed a hiring freeze in July. </TEXT></DOC>
