The Conference Board said its Consumer Confidence Index tumbledto 105.1 in January from 113 in December and 115.8 in January ayear earlier.   Fabian Linden, executive director of the New York-based businessresearch group's consumer research center, said ``the size of thedecline must be regarded as a possible, though not unmistakable,indication of economic troubles ahead.''   He noted, however, that ``in the context of the survey'shistory, the present level of consumer confidence does not yetsignal a likely recession in the coming months.''   The January reading was the lowest since the index registered100.8 in November 1987, the month after world financial marketssuffered major setbacks. On Oct. 19, 1987, the Dow Jones industrialaverage of 30 blue-chip stocks plummeted 508 points to 1,738.74, aloss of 22.6 percent of its value.   A monthly survey of 5,000 households throughout the countryindicated that people are less comfortable with their situationsand less optimistic about the next six months than they were whenpolled in December, the Conference Board said.   The latest poll showed 18.5 percent of all those respondingexpressed the view that business conditions were bad, a slightlylarger percentage than in December.   Only about one in four respondents believed that jobs were``plentiful,'' a figure that has been going steadily lower inrecent months. On the employment outlook, pessimists outnumberedoptimists for the first time since late 1987.   Expectations about economic conditions in the next half-yearhave deteriorated, the board said. Only 16.2 percent of therespondents thought that business would improve, down about 2percentage points from December.   Buying plans didn't show much change in the January survey. Thepercentage of people planning to buy a car fell slightly to 6.9percent. There still was strong interest in purchasing majorappliances while the number of people planning to buy homes barelybudged from its low level of 3.4 percent.   The survey is conducted for the board each month by NationalFamily Opinion of Toledo, Ohio.</TEXT></DOC>
