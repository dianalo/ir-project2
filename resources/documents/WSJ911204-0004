So far this year, market pressures have driven down pricesof some legal work by as much as 20%. Many on corporate legalstaffs are expecting prices to continue to drop well into1992.</LP><TEXT>   The insistence on bargains, spearheaded by such big legalspenders as General Motors Corp., Irvine Co. and MotorolaInc., reflects a nearly revolutionary shift in the balance ofpower between big-time law firms and their clients.   &quot;Two years ago, {lawyers} didn't talk about fees when theypitched you,&quot; says Peter D. Zeughauser, general counsel ofIrvine and until recently chairman of the American CorporateCounsel Association, a trade group. &quot;They were embarrassedabout the fees, and they didn't talk about the subject.Nobody talked about discounting. It's totally different now.&quot;   The king of the price choppers may be Harry J. Pearce,vice president and general counsel of General Motors, whichspends about $250 million a year on legal services. In aneffort to control the company's whopping legal tab, GM'sin-house legal team has extracted cut-rate deals from bothlarge and small legal vendors for work ranging from smallbreach-of-warranty cases to complex product-liability suits.   &quot;I'll be quite frank about it,&quot; says Mr. Pearce. &quot;We havemore leverage to do that than many other clients, and I'm notunwilling to use that leverage.&quot;   To aid his effort, Mr. Pearce has instituted acomputerized fee-tracking system that allows him to comparethe cost of using the company's top 30 law firms -- whichcharge GM a total of about $100 million a year -- for variouskinds of work. The statistics spewed out by the computer haveshown &quot;some less than stellar results&quot; among the &quot;highercosting firms,&quot; says Mr. Pearce.   Recently, GM has hauled in its top law firms for visits atwhich they were told where they stand compared with thecompetition. &quot;Where we have a firm that doesn't look good,&quot;says Mr. Pearce, &quot;our message is very simple: We'll give youtime to get your act together, and we will continue tomonitor your efforts. And if we don't see improvement, youwon't get any more of our business.&quot;   In the years before the recession began to take its tollon law firms, Mr. Pearce's exhortations might have beenignored by many of the legal behemoths he retains. But lawfirms that overflowed with business in the late '80s are nowscrounging for new accounts and worried about competition.They are ready to make customized deals.   One small but telling example involves an 18-month-oldarrangement between General Motors and Chukwuemeka N.Chionuma, a Kansas City, Mo., lawyer, concerningbreach-of-warranty cases. The deal calls for the company tofunnel all such cases filed by dissatisfied car buyers inMissouri and parts of Kansas to Mr. Chionuma's nine-lawyerfirm. In return, the firm, North andamp; Chionuma, charges thecompany a predetermined flat fee, rather than a traditionalhourly rate. The cost to GM on each case is the same whetherthe case takes a month or a year to settle or to try.   The law firm generally handles about eight to 10breach-of-warranty cases for GM at any given time. &quot;With thevolume of work that was assigned to us, we were able topropose and maintain a flat rate that is substantially belowwhat our hourly bill would have been,&quot; says Mr. Chionuma. GMhas worked out similar arrangements with other legal vendors,including firms in Minneapolis and New York, forproduct-liability cases and other litigation.   Mr. Zeughauser of Irvine says that in the past six monthshe hasn't encountered a single law firm unwilling to discountits rates. In fact, he says, some law firms have offered todo work free of charge &quot;as a way of introducing themselves tothe account.&quot; While the Newport Beach, Calif., company hasn'taccepted any such freebies, Mr. Zeughauser has tried apanoply of arrangements for cutting costs.   He is now having three law firms compete for legal workconnected to a series of office leases. The firms suppliedIrvine with staffing plans and offered discounts. Each willhandle a few leases on a trial basis, and then Irvine willselect one of the firms.   Irvine has also negotiated deep discounts with Latham andamp;Watkins, a large Los Angeles law firm that has traditionallyhandled much of the company's legal work. For some work,Irvine locked into a discounted billing schedule with Lathamandamp; Watkins for a two-year period. The biggest cuts were madein the hourly rates for junior associate lawyers and seniorpartners, says Latham partner Gregory P. Lindstrom.   &quot;As best we can figure it out, we try to come in a littlelower than the competition so there's an attractiveinducement to use us,&quot; Mr. Lindstrom says. He acknowledgesthat for some routine work, large law firms areinterchangeable. &quot;It's not going to affect the outcome of theproduct in {Irvine's} judgment,&quot; he says. &quot;And they're goingto be very price-conscious at that point.&quot;   Irvine generates about $1 million a year for Latham, whichbarely puts the client among the law firm's top 100 feegenerators, according to Mr. Lindstrom. But, he says, &quot;Toprosper in the '90s you've got to be competitive and flexibleat that level. . . . It's tough out there.&quot;   That was the lesson learned by two Houston law firms thatin recent years had done substantial work for Texas CommerceBancshares Inc., according to the company's senior vicepresident and general counsel, Shelby R. Rogers Jr. The lawfirms, which Mr. Rogers wouldn't name, were dropped by theHouston company after bank officers complained aboutinefficiencies such as overstaffing, excessive pretrialfact-finding and too many interoffice conferences.   Now Mr. Rogers, who says he started receiving bargain-rateoffers from law firms a year ago, is testing severalcost-cutting schemes. He is currently soliciting bids fromfour Texas law firms for legal work connected to sales of asignificant number of foreclosed properties. &quot;We would liketo cut a deal with a law firm to handle all of them inexchange for a set price,&quot; he says, adding: &quot;We expect toreceive some fairly competitive prices.&quot; Contenders mustsubmit plans for staffing and proposals for pricing -- ateither per-deal prices or bulk rates.   Some companies are looking for ways to avoid lawyersaltogether for certain work. Motorola senior vice presidentand general counsel Richard H. Weise has embarked on severaldaring cost-cutting experiments. In one, immigration work forthe company's semiconductor-products sector -- which had costthe company $700,000 to $800,000 a year -- has been removedfrom the legal department's jurisdiction.   About two months ago, legal matters pertaining toimmigration were taken over by the sector's personneldepartment, according to that department's senior vicepresident and director, David L. Pulatie. Now, instead oflawyers, an administrator with international experienceassisted by two paralegals who work for the personneldepartment handle most of the work. The outside law firm andin-house counsel that previously did the work are only calledoccasionally.   Mr. Weise is expecting significant savings. &quot;Clientswithin their own organization can learn to do certain typesof legal work as well as we can with a much lower cost,&quot; hesays.   In-house lawyers waging war against escalating fees saytheir experiments are only the beginning of an era ofinnovation. GM's Mr. Pearce, for example, maintains thatsavvy law firms will increasingly take the initiative to helpclients keep a lid on fees.   Law firms that &quot;step up to the efficiency issue, and ontheir own volition come up with innovative proposals, theywill become the pre-eminent firms in the country,&quot; Mr. Pearcesays. &quot;They will find themselves with a great glut ofclients.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
