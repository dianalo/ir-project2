However, Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Managementand Budget, said the automatic cuts can be avoided if Congress fullyimplements a budget agreement reached with the administration inApril.   ``It remains my hope, and my cautiously optimistic expectation,that necessary legislation may be enacted prior to'' Oct. 1 thatwould cut the deficit to the maximum $100 billion level specified bythe Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law, Darman said in a letter toPresident Bush.   Darman expressed that hope as his office made public a reportgauging progress made in reducing the deficit. ``We are cutting itvery close,'' he said.   That report projects a deficit of $116.2 billion in the 1990fiscal year. The Gramm-Rudman law limits the deficit to $100 billionin that year but allows a $10 billion cushion before requiringacross-the-board spending cuts. However, once spending cuts aretriggered, the full $16.2 billion reduction would be required.   Those automatic cuts, known in Washington jargon as``sequestration,'' would require a 5.3 percent reduction in mostnon-defense spending _ but not Social Security benefits, for example_ and a 4.3 percent cut in military spending.   The OMB report spelled out in detail how programs might beaffected by the arbitrary cuts.   For example, it said, cuts could undermine the ability of theDrug Enforcement Administration to fight illegal drugs;significantly hamper efforts by the Public Health Service to preventthe spread of AIDS; require furlough of Federal AviationAdministration personnel for three days a month; and reduce grantsfor needy college students by $1 billion below the level recommendedby the Department of Education.   The OMB forecast is based on economic projections that are moreoptimistic than those used by the Congressional Budget Office. CBOsaid last week that deficit-reduction efforts enacted so far wouldleave $141.5 billion of red ink in 1990 _ $25 billion above the OMBestimate.   Most of that gap is accounted for by the differing assumptionsabout economic growth and inflation, plus technical differences onhow the recently enacted bailout for the savings and loan industrywill be implemented.</TEXT></DOC>
