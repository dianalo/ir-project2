Rep. Robin Tallon, D-S.C., who traveled to Australia and NewZealand with three colleagues and their spouses last November saidhe was ``absolutely unaware'' of the filing requirements under the1978 Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act.   He wasn't alone.   ``If I didn't file, it was an oversight,'' said Rep. CharlesStenholm, D-Texas, chairman of a House agriculture subcommittee onlivestock, dairy and poultry and leader of the delegation thatspent 12 days in the two countries. Two of Stenholm's colleagues,however, did complete the forms.   The act was intended to prevent conflicts of interest byensuring disclosure of gifts from foreign governments, includingtravel expenses.   Other lawmakers who didn't fill out the forms also pledged to doso if congressional ethics officials deem it necessary.   The officials say they have no way of knowing how many membersof Congress fail to file the reports. Conviction of violating thelaw could carry a civil penalty of $5,000 plus the cost of thegift, but no member of Congress has been charged with failing tofile a proper foreign travel expense report.   In 1988, two senators and eight House members filed travelexpense reports under the gifts act.   Among those who didn't, at least at first:   _Sens. James Exon, D-Neb.; Larry Pressler, R-S.D.; Tom Harkin,D-Iowa; and then-Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont. They and othersreceived transportation paid for by the governments of New Zealandand Australia during a January 1988 congressional trip to thosecountries.   _Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, who spent one night at aninternational conference in Potsdam, East Germany, last June.   ``Since we never knew about it (the law), we never filled itout,'' said Mark Bowen, Exon's spokesman. Exon subsequentlyreported the travel expenses.   ``I'm going to check with the appropriate Senate office and ifindeed it's determined that a report was not filed that should havebeen filed, then we'll do that,'' said Don Foley, Harkin'sadministrative assistant.   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., chairman of the Senate SelectCommittee on Ethics, was the lone senator on the trip to the twocountries to disclose the travel expenses on a gifts anddecorations act form.   Stenholm neglected to file even though he was advised by theHouse ethics committee chairman, Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., that``the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act ... requires that expensesfor travel provided by a foreign government be reported to thecommittee within 30 days of departure from the donor country.''   Dixon enclosed a copy of the form with the advice to Stenholm.   Overseas expenses for the Stenholm delegation were paid byQantas Airways, the Australian government-owned airline, andseveral private, quasi-private and foreign government entities,such as the Australian Meat and Livestock Corp., the New ZealandWool Board and the New Zealand Meat Producers Board, Stenholm said.   Bryan Yolles, an attorney with Clifford andamp; Warnke, the firm thathelped arrange the trip to Australia, said no foreign governmentmoney was used in the trip. But House rules say funding by``quasi-governmental'' organizations must be listed.   The Institute for East-West Security Studies, a non-profitresearch organization in New York, paid Cohen's travel expenses butdidn't tell him the East Germans were picking up expenses in thecountry, said Kathy Gest, spokeswoman for Cohen.   ``If we should have filled one out, we will,'' Gest said. ``It'soften not clear in situations like this,'' she said. Cohen's officeplanned to check to see if his expenses exceeded the $100 thattriggers the filing requirement for the Senate. The House minimumis $180.   Rep. Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., who also attended the conference,did file a gift form, estimating the value of lodging and meals forthree days at the Interhotel in Potsdam at $400.   To ensure that senators are aware of the law, the Senate ethicscommittee sent all members a copy of it, plus an explanation, in aletter last November.   In some cases, members of Congress or their aides apparentlyfilled out the forms unnecessarily.   ``The confusion indicates to me ... it's not being enforced,''said Bernard Wruble, a private attorney who formerly headed theOffice of Government Ethics. But he said public officials have an``inescapable responsibility'' to know who is providing them withsomething of significant value.</TEXT></DOC>
