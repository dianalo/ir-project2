Col. Oliver North and Vice Adm. John Poindexter to relinquish their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination come close.    Words come to commentators easily. But how does the press act in an analogous situation?    I refer, of course, to the Fourth Estate's own constitutional cause militant, the so-called First Amendment &quot;shield&quot; that reporters automatically invoke when the state has compelled their testimony. Imagine, if you will, the press's reaction to public pressure on a publisher to &quot;encourage&quot; (read coerce) one of his reporters to drop this &quot;shield&quot; in the face of a subpoena! Ronald Reagan, take note.    In different ways and for different purposes, the Fifth Amendment and the so-called &quot;shield&quot; of the First provide essentially the same thing: protection against state-compelled testimony. That Messrs. North and Poindexter are technically correct in taking the Fifth, I believe no one doubts. Any lawyer counseling them otherwise under the prevailing circumstances would (and should) probably face professional disciplinary measures.    Upon closer examination, the Fifth Amendment affords these two unfortunates clearer and more solid protection than the First Amendment's illusory press shield provides to the press.    &quot;No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. . . .&quot; These words from the Fifth Amendment, adopted in 1791 as part of the Bill of Rights, are simple, clear and direct. They were intended to prohibit forced confessions of guilt by the accused. In a single phrase, the protection ensured that in order for the state to obtain convictions it would have to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt with evidence other than that wrung involuntarily from the accused. Its greatest affirmation came in the 1966 case of Miranda vs. Arizona Supreme Court, setting forth explicit warnings that police are to give an accused person in custodial interrogations. That the Fifth Amendment may be invoked before congressional panels, as Messrs. North and Poindexter have done, has long been recognized and judicially upheld. It was, in fact, recognized as early as 1857 when Congress enacted its first immunity statute.    By contrast, the First Amendment contains no language even remotely giving the press any kind of &quot;shield&quot; from state-compelled disclosures of evidence. The relevant portion states only that &quot;Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press. . . .&quot; Reporters are fond of claiming that this language in the First Amendment gives them the &quot;right&quot; to refuse to testify before fact-finding bodies of the state, especially grand juries. In a typical situation, a confidential source gives a reporter information about possible criminal wrongdoing. The information gets published, and a grand jury subpoenas the reporter, who refuses to testify. Following a well-publicized hearing, our heroic reporter is then jailed for contempt and his publisher is interviewed on the evening news, offering us insight about post-Anschluss Austria in 1938.    Yet the Supreme Court has never inferred a First Amendment &quot;shield&quot; that reporters so automatically invoke. More frequently, a limited press shield is provided by statute in many states. Note also that the party protected by the Fifth is the accused himself, whereas reporters invoke the &quot;shield&quot; not on their own behalf, but for a third-party beneficiary, the confidential source.    Editorial calls for Messrs. North and Poindexter to waive a precious right could undercut the press's own invoking of its beloved, but illusory, press shield. After all, many journalists are talking to many confidential sources about a lot of wrongdoing these days. Like the colonel and the admiral, they probably now have, or will have, evidence that the state may soon want to subpoena. Many of them, in fact, may soon rely on the same Constitution to justify withholding information from the state.    ---   Mr. Wilburn, a former Associated Press reporter, is a lawyer in Washington. </TEXT></DOC>
