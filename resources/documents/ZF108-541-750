Ask anyone in the know for adefinition of multimedia and you're bound to get a collection of personal,often self-serving, visions.andP;  In its broadeast sense, multimedia refers tothe delivery of information in intuitive, multisensory ways through theintegration of hitherto distinct meadia--text, graphics, computer animation,motio video, and sound--in a single presentation under the control of thecomputer.andP;  But the ways of doing this are still in a state of rapid andconfusing evolution.andM;Today, multimedia all too often means multiheadches.andP;  Creating a multimediaapplication requires a hodgepodge of heterogeneous tools, a walloping dose oftechnical expertise, the ability to think about information inmultidimensional ways, and, last but not least, a sizable investment in apowerful computing platform and complex peripherals.andM;So why should a hard-headed business person be interested in it?andP;  Simple.andO;The pie in the sky is plummeting to earth.andP;  In our age of informationoverload, the benefits of superb imagery and high-fidelity sound becomeincreasingly clear: they allow us to experience information rather thansimply acquire it.andM;By now you may have caught a glimpse of the multimedia future.andP;  A MarcusWelby look-alike appears in an on-screen window to coach a medical student ina simulated gall bladder operation.andP;  An executive gets stock information froman on-screen video news feed while animated business graphics simultaneouslyprovide company statistics.andP;  An art historian delivers a memorablesound-and-insight presentation on Renaissance art right to the desks of herstudents.andM;But how do you get from here to there?andP;  In this issue, PC Magazine takes ahands-on comparative look at five multimedia authoring systems--the softwareenvironments that glue together multimedia's disparate elements.andP;  Thoughthese aren't the alpha and omega of multimedia by a long shot, they do sit atthe center of things.andP;  Our tour of them will show you how the pieces of themultimedia puzzle fit together.andM;A PLATFORM, NOT A PRODUCTandM;Multimedia computing is fueled by the rapid development of digitaltechnology.andP;  Now that computers incorporate text and graphics as a matter ofcourse, it's but another step to the inclusion of photorealistic images,sound, and motion video.andP;  As digital CD players, digital cameras, digitalVCRs, and, eventually, digital high-definition television take hold inconsumer electronic markets, the previously segregated worlds of television,audio, and computing become intermingled in a single universe of bits andbytes.andM;Yet it will be a long time before you'll find multimedia applications allnicely shrink-wrapped under &quot;M&quot; on your dealer's shelves.andP;  Multimedia is nota product, nor even a technology.andP;  It's better seen as a platform--acombination of hardware and software elements that together support amultisensory information environment.andP;  Someday these components may bestandard equipment in everyday PC's.andP;  But today, multimedia is very much araw frontier in which tools and skills are mixed and matched depending on thesources you want to incorporate into your presentations.andM;FROM PROCESS TO PRODUCTandM;So what can you do with a multimedia?andP;  Historically, multimedia technologiesfound their first significant application in computer-based training (CBT).andO;Learning to assemble a machine or to understand a complex procedure requiresvisual realism, which CBT courses achieve by delivering controlled videosegments from a videodisk, reinforced with audio cues at appropriate points.andO;The student navigates the information at his or her own pace, while thesystem maintains a progress record.andP;  Until fairly recently.andP;  CBT was theprovince of specialized turnkey systems such as IBM's InfoWindows and Sony'sViews, but manufacturers are now making their audio and video boards andtheir authoring systems available on standard PCs.andM;Business presentations, broadly defined, make up the other area in whichusing multimedia makes sense.andP;  Television-like images and realistic stereosound add drama to standard presentations.andP;  More important, integrating videoand audio in a single computer makes it possible to create interactivepresentations that offer information on an as-you-need-it basis instead of awhether-you-want-it-or-not basis.andP;  Such presentations can be tailored forvarious viewing audiences--from a group with a live presenter to a standalonesystem in a kiosk or point-of-purchase environment.andM;The future holds even more exhilarating prospects: animated visualizationsand digital teleconferencing, even a new form of electronic publishing inwhich collaboratively created works fuse text, art, animation, video, andaudio in a compound document accessible over computer networks.andP;  And don'tforget entertainment.andP;  The interactivity and sensory richness that multimediaoffers may well be the deciding factor that finally puts a computer intoevery home.andP;  New CD-based multimedia standards are being driven by thispotential gold mine, but in the meantime, stay tuned for games andeducational simulations geared to new machines like Fujitsu's FM-Townes andTandy's 2500XL, which package CD-ROM drives or videodisk players, stereosound, and other multimedia components in a low-priced package for theconsumer market.andM;PLAYING CATCH-UPandM;The PC may be the king of business computing, but it lags a bit in themultimedia field.andP;  As of today at least, the Apple Macintosh sets thestandard.andP;  The Mac's integral graphical user interface, its built-in soundchip, and its well-defined standards for sharing graphic information make itan attractive platform for multimedia software developers.andP;  Thus, while thePC has a plethora of authoring programs, none go as far as MacroMind'sDirector on the Macintosh, which uses a score metaphor that lets youchoreograph graphics, sound, and animation sequences in a common workspace(see the sidebar &quot;A Peek at the Competition&quot;).andM;Less visible but equally notable is Commodore's Amiga.andP;  Engineered withNTSC-compatible video hardware, custom graphics chips, and digital soundsupport on the motherboard, the Amiga has acquired a devoted following amonganimators and desktop video producers.andP;  It supports a sizable number ofmultimedia tools, and specifies common file formats and compression standardsfor animations as well as for still graphics.andM;Achieving an equivalent level of multimedia support on a PC today meanssifting through dozens or potentially incompatible product add-ons.andP;  But ahuge installed base cheers it on.andP;  And though the PC's open, flexiblearchitecture creates the possibility of conflicting standards, it also makesa better platform for custom solutions.andP;  Future developments will give thenext generation of PCs a leg up, but in the meantime, if you plan to use thePC as a multimedia platform, count on a certain amount of rolling your own.andM;THE MULTIMEDIA TOOL BOXandM;Before the elements of a multimedia application can be assembled, they mustfirst be brought into the computer in a suitable form.andP;  The skills needed todo this work on a PC are disparate, and you'll need a correspondingly widevariety of tools.andM;Text and graphic images are the easiest to handle, as their standard's arethe best-defined.andP;  Most authoring systems have only limited drawingcapabilities, relying instead on images imported from other applications orscanned in through affordable desktop scanners.andP;  Thus a shelf well-stockedwith high-end paint programs, drawing programs, type manipulation tools, andgraphics file translators, is indispensable to the multimedia developer.andM;Animation, as simple as a bar chart that grows before your eyes or ascomplicated as an architectural walkthrough, adds another dimension to theprocess.andP;  Autodesk Animator, at the forefront of low-cost PC animation,offers a wide variety of animation tools for the creative-minded, includingcanned optical effects, cel animation, and tweening (where the movementbetween key frames is computer generated).andP;  Paul Mace Software's GRASP offersmore professional-level animation tools.andM;Getting sound into your PC requires an audio capture board, which convertsthe analog input generated by a microphone or cassette recorder into asampled digital waveform that can be stored on your hard disk.andP;  The best ofthe lot use digital signal processor (DSP) chips more efficient sampling, andsome boards can bring synthesized digital sound in directly through a MIDIinterface.andP;  Unfortunately, the complete lack of standards forces developersto support audio hardware case-by-case.andM;SNAPSHOTSandM;It's video that makes multimedia sizzle, but incorporating conventionalbroadcast television signals into computer-based presentations is the mostproblematic area in multimedia computing.andP;  Today, PCs and video devicesbelong to separate worlds, with different standards for scanning rates andresolution.andP;  Bridging the gap requires an array of special hardware devices.andM;The easiest and most straightforward way to handle video is to treat it likegraphics.andP;  Using one of a number of image capture boards on the market, youcan take a freeze frame from any video source, be it VCR, a video camera, avideodisk player, or even a live feed, and store it as a file on your harddisk where it can be treated like any other graphics file.andP;  The Targa fileformat, first generated by True Vision's Targa videographics boards and nowsupported by a range of Targa workalikes, has become something of a de factostandard for captured video images.andP;  Targa files can be converted to standardPC formats.andM;MOVING PICTURESandM;Bringing in motion video requires a different strategy.andP;  You can achieve afacsimile of motion by a method analogous to computer animation: capturing aseries, of successive video frames and playing them back more or lessrapidly, usually between 10 to 15 frames per second.andP;  But though thisapproach can successfully incorporate small &quot;movies&quot; into a presentation, itquickly breaks down on bigger jobs.andM;The reason is as simple as elementary arithmetic.andP;  At the U.S.andP;  broadcastrate of 30 frames per second, 1 minute of high-quality full-motion videorequires something on the order of 2 gigabytes of storage.andP;  Withoutcompression technology to squeeze this megabyte-gobbling imagery into asmaller space, digital video is ridiculously impractical.andP;  Hence theimportance of video compression and decompression schemes such as Intel's DVI(see the sidebar &quot;Digital Video Arrives&quot;).andM;VIDEODISKS RULEandM;In the meantime, the best source of motion video input is the analogvideodisk.andP;  A mature technology with proven reliability, these 12-inchplatters can hold up to an hour of high-quality full-motion video, plus twoaudio tracks that can be played separately or together.andP;  CAV-type videodiskplayers designed for use with computers afford fairly quick random access toindividual frames, and their cost is reasonable: suitable players from Sony,Pioneer, Panasonic, and others can be had for as little as $1,000.andM;The limitations? videodisks are bulky, read-only affairs.andP;  Though the cost ofmastering a videodisk for low-volume use has come down tremendously over thelast few years, producing the video source with conventional equipment stilltakes a considerable outlay.andP;  While a few videodisk recorders are availablefrom TEAC Sony, and others, they cost on the order of $10,000, and theirdisks are incompatible with standard videodisk players.andM;Though videodisks are easily controlled through a standard serial port, theirNTSC video output is incompatible with PC video standards.andP;  Therefore,getting video on your PC screen requires you to add a motion video board toyour computer to convert the signals.andP;  Older-model boards, such as the SonySMI-3081, simply let you play the video source on your PC monitor, but a newbreed of more-sophisticated boards lets you play video in a window, to clipit, scale it, overlay it with computer graphics, or even to impose a varietyof special effects such as mosaics, elongations, or split screens (see thesidebar &quot;Multimedia by Videodisk: Motion Video Boards for the PC&quot;).andM;AUTHOR, AUTHOR!andM;Authoring systems are the tie that binds these multiple media together.andP;  PCauthoring systems are as individual as their developers, but most take aflowchart approach that lets you specify the elements you'd like toincorporate and string them together in the order you'd like them to appear.andO;Specify transitions from one image to another or create animations using clipor frame animation techniques.andP;  Motion video is integrated by specifying thebeginning and end points of each video clip, and video tools let you overlaytitles and text atop it.andP;  Audio control ranges from simple playback from avideodisk audio track to complex musical notation systems.andM;Interactivity is one of multimedia's chief selling points, and most authoringsystems let you specify branch points and conditional events where users canmake choices about how to proceed with the presentation.andP;  The most flexibleauthoring systems use hypermedia concepts for maximum user control over theinformation.andP;  While hypermedia systems do best at handling text and graphics,their object-oriented design lends them to audio and video presentations aswell: clicking on a hypertext button can play a sound or video clip just aseasily as it can display a picture or jump to a text window.andM;STORE AND DELIVERandM;With its high-resolution graphics and sound files, multimedia makesunprecedented demands on storage space, and these demands will only becomemore acute as digital video hits the scene.andP;  While large hard disks areuseful for authoring and for limited in-house distribution over local areanetworks, CD-ROM is the best bet today for distributing multimediaapplications widely.andP;  WORM drives, erasable CDs, magneto-optical drives, andother exotica offer the possibility of denser and cheaper storage in thefuture.andM;Though they are strictly read-only, CD-ROMs hold more than 600MB of data in arugged, compact package, and their drives can be added to standard PCs at areasonable cost.andP;  CD-ROM mastering costs much less than it used to, thanks tolow-cost prepublishing software from companies such as Reference Technologyand Meridian Data, and to service bureaus that offer offsite masteringfacilities at reasonable fees.andM;The High Sierra format that CD-ROMs use specifies only data, not audio orvideo.andP;  CD-ROM XA (Extended Architecture) interleaves data with compressedaudio on the same disk.andP;  CD-ROM players modified to support CD-ROM XA arecurrently under development, and Microsoft plans to support it as amultimedia delivery technology on PCs.andP;  A more ambitious standard, CD-I,which includes specifications for compressed motion video as well as forsound and data, is also under development, but it won't appear on PCplatforms, at least in the short term.andM;The use of CD-ROM presumes that you're delivering the presentation on a PCequipped with the appropriate audio and video equipment.andP;  This is excellentfor one-on-one presentations or small groups, but for large audiences,consider the videotape--the cheapest and most compact way to integrate audio,video, and computer graphics--though not a very flexible or interactive one.andO;VGA-to-NTSC converter boards with built-in genlocking make it relatively easyto record your PC-based presentations on videotape--and even to overlay themon a live video source.andM;MORE TALK, MORE PRODUCTSandM;The next year or so will be a tumultuous scene or activity in the PCmultimedia arena.andP;  The big news is DVI; the first commercial productsincorporating these processor chips from Intel should appear by the time youread this.andP;  Topping the list is Intel's ProMedia 750, a matched set ofreal-time video boards that can be used for authoring and playback.andP;  Thecompression board, which you'll need for playing multimedia presentationsfrom CD-ROM or your hard disk, costs $1,995 with 1MB of RAM or $2,495 with2MB of RAM; its companion video capture board, necessary only if you need torecord motion video onto your hard disk, costs $2,150.andM;Intel's DVI boards will be supported by new or revamped authoring systemsfrom CEIT (Authology MM, $4,500) and Network Technology (Mediascript,$1,500), as well as by updated versions of Intel's own authoring tools andsoftware libraries.andP;  Time Arts is already selling a version of Lumena, itshigh-end paint program, that developers can use to edit high-resolutionDVI-standard images; the basic version is $1,500 and the production-levelversion costs $2,500.andM;GIANT MOVESandM;The major vendors in the PC world continue to hammer out their multimediastrategies.andP;  IBM's far-flung empire, whose marketing efforts have coalescedunder the umbrella of a single Multimedia Solutions group, has manymultimedia projects in the works.andP;  An enhanced version of its Audio VisualConnection authoring system, which will support the new M:Motion board, isexpected by fall.andP;  In the longer term, IBM is working closely with Intel topromulgate the DVI gospel and has expressed a notable interest in using DVIchips at the board level in future PS/2s, fueling rumors that it is preparinga line of competitively-priced &quot;multimedia PCs&quot; sporting multimedia featuressuch as CD-ROM, touch-screens, and stereo sound.andP;  Though IBM is close-mouthedon this subject, you can reasonably expect to see concrete evidence of thisnew breed of machines sometime in 1990.andM;Meanwhile, Microsoft is starting the enormous task of retrofitting Windowsand OS/2 Presentation Manager to support multimedia data structures.andO;Microsoft representatives say that we'll see &quot;multimedia extensions&quot; forWindows late in 1990 or early in 1991, and that the same code will beincorporated into the OS/2 environment at some unspecified future date.andO;These extensions will appear to applications as device drivers or dynamiclink libraries, letting developers link multimedia subroutines into them atruntime.andP;  Microsoft has also licensed the Director playback technology fromMacroMind and says that it intends to incorporate it into Windows, and hasestablished alliances with other developers as well.andM;Some of what Microsoft intends to do is already available inHewlett-Packard's NewWave, an object-oriented extension to Windows thatoffers a number of useful benefits to multimedia developers.andP;  NewWave'sObject Manager treats all elements--text, graphics, video, and audio--simplyas objects regardless of their origins, and its Agent can automate operationsinvolving multiple applications without knowing specifically about them.andO;NewWave drivers for a number of multimedia boards have already beenannounced.andM;As this list makes clear, the groundwork is being laid for a day in thenot-too-distant future when computing with audio and video will become asnatural for us as computing with text and graphics is now.andP;  1991 should bethe pivotal year, but in the meantime, enough is already out there to getstarted.andM;A MULTIMEDIA GLOSSARYandM;Asynmetric system A video system that requires more equipment to store,process, or compress a digital image than it needs to play that image back.andO;Intel's Digital Video Interactive (DVI) system and the Philips/SonyCD-Isystem are asymmetric in their full fidelity modes.andM;Authoring system The development environment used to create a multimediaproject or presentation.andP;  It is not necessarily needed for playback (seeDelivery system).andM;CAV and CLV The two main ways of recording video on videodisks.andP;  In the CAV(constant angular velocity) method, the rotation speed of the disk staysconstant, while with the CLV (constant linear velocity) method, the rotationrate changes to keep data on the disk passing the laser pickup at a constantrate.andP;  CAV videodiscs are capable of random access and therefore are the typegenerally used for interactive multimedia applications.andM;CBT Computer-based Training--the use of computers for interactive instructon,education, and training.andP;  An important use for multimedia.andM;CD-I Compact Disc Interactive--a standard for CDs that lets you integratedata, still graphics, audio, and motion video on the same disk.andM;CD-ROM XA Compact Disc Read-Only Memory Extended Architecture--a CD formatthat adds interleaved audio to data within the basic CD-ROM format.andM;Color key A color-based video overlay method that lets you drop all areas ofa selected color out of a foreground image so that the corresponding areas ofthe background image can show through it.andP;  Also called chroma key.andM;Composite video A video signal that combines all the color and timingcomponents of the picture in a single input line.andM;Delivery system The hardware and software needed to play back a multimediapresentation.andP;  It is often less costly and less sophisticated than the systemrequired to create the presentation (see Authoring system).andM;DSP Digital Signal Processor--a specialized computer chip designed to performspeedy and complex operations on digitized  waveforms.andP;  Useful in processingsound and video.andM;DVI digital Video Interactive--Intel's proprietary technology for puttingfull-motion video on CDs and magnetic media at a very high level ofcompression.andM;Frame In video and videographics, a complete picture.andM;Full-motion video Said of video sequences or systems that provide enoughimages per second to afford the illusion of smooth motion.andP;  Often defined asthe rate of U.S.andP;  standard video signals (30 frames per second).andM;Genlock Short for synchronization generator lock, a feature that allows avideo system to set its timing to match the timing of an outside signal, andso to overlay one signal on top of the other or to smoothly combine them.andM;Hypermedia A method of information delivery that provides multiple connectedpathways through a body of information, allowing the user to jump easily fromone topic to related or supplementary material, which may be in text,graphics, audio, or video form.andM;Interlaced video A video format that creates images by first drawing outevery other line in the image as one field, then sweeping down the screenagain to fill in the intervening lines.andP;  This method is used forbroadcast-standard NTSC video because it lets images be created withrelatively low signal rates, but with computer video it often results inunacceptable flickering on sharper transitions.andM;JPEG Joint Photographic Experts Group--a working group established to developa standard for compressing and storing still images in digital form, or theproposed standard under development by this group (see MPEG).andM;MPEG Moving Pictures Experts Group--a working group established to develop astandard for compressing and storing motion video and animation in digitalform, or the proposed standard under development by this group.andM;NTSC An abbreviation for National Televison Systems Committee, the industrygroup that formulated the standard for U.S.andP;  color television.andP;  NTSC signals(today, those meeting the equivalent RS-170A standard) use interlaced scansand 525 horizontal lines per frame at a rate of 30 frames per second.wandM;Overlay To show one image superimposed on another.andP;  Especially in videoimages, to show text on top of a picture or computer output on top of movingvideo (see Genlock).andM;PAL The format for color television signals used in West Germany, England,Holland, and several other countries.andP;  It uses an interlaced format with 25frames per second and 625 lines per screen.andM;RGB Video signals that use three signal lines to carry the red, green, andblue poretions of the picture information.andM;SECAM A format for television signals used in France, the U.S.S.R., EasternEurope, and other countries.andP;  It uses an interlaced image made of 625 linesat 25 frames per second.andM;S-video Separated video--a video signal format that puts the chroma (color)and luminance (brightness) information on separate signal lines instead of ina single composite signal.andP;  Super-VHS videocassette recorders rely on S-videofor imporved quality.andM;Symmetric system A video system that is capable of both storing and playingback compressed digital images (see Asymmetric system).andM;Targa A trademark of True Vision Inc. for one of its lines of videographicdisplay boards.andP;  More loosely, it refers to the file format (supporting262,144 colors out of a palette of 16.m million at 512 by 512 resolution)that was established for use with these boards and is widely used in themultimedia field.andM;Videographic Video adapters, monitors, and other computer output equipmentdesigned to connect computer video systems to broadcast-style video systems.andM;EDITOR'S CHOICEandM;Though our tests show that multimedia has arrived on the PC, they also showthat it's not well enough developed to warrant an Editor's Choice designationthis year.andP;  Hardware dependencies, graphics import difficulties, videocomplexities, and user-interface deficiencies make all of these productsproblematic purchases for most business users their generally high prices areanother hindrance to widespread use.andM;But if you're in the market today and you're prepared for what's in store,you can make some reasonable choices.andP;  If y our goal is interactivemultimedia presentations, Instant Replay Professional deserves an honorablemention: it performed best on our test presentation, and its software isreasonably priced.andP;  You should be aware, however, that it is exceptionallycomplex and works only with one type of motion video board.andP;  In the long run,a better choice may be IconAuthor, whose user interface is farclearer--provided that its Windows 3.0 version does indeed solve itsmemory-management problems, as the vendor claims it will.andM;Presentations aren't the only way to use multimedia.andP;  Though the above twosystems are versatile enough for building training systems, CBT systems likeQuest and TIE offer special support for scoring and evaluation; they may beworth a look if this is your goal.andP;  Finally, though Guide looks weak in ourtest presentation, don't discount it in the kind of text-rich hypermediaapplications to which it's best suited.andM;By next year, further development of standards and the emergence of asignificant group of DVI products should make your choices easier.andP;  In themeantime, watch this space: multimedia is in your future.andM;EVALUATING MULTIMEDIAandM;In developing our testing script for the multimedia authoring systems, PCLabs found itself face to face with the same problems that confront businessusers trying to implement this complex technology.andP;  The process of designinga presentaton and working through the plethora of hardware options requirednumerous choices before a single authoring system could be installe.andM;Our premise called for an interactive multimedia presentation of the kindthat might be presented at a point-of-information kiosk in a travel agency.andO;According, we conceived a sketch for a presentation on behalf of fictionalWAP Airlines, promoting a new route to the Falkland Islands.andP;  This, we felt,would test most of the important functons multimedia applications wouldrequire, as it would marshall text, graphics images, scanned photographs,animation, sound, and full-motion video to the job of convincing potentialtravelers to find out about the fun awaiting them in the Falklands.andM;So, we had a plan.andP;  Next, we needed hardware.andP;  For the authoringworkstations, we used Compaq 386 machines (two 25 MHz and one 16 MHz),equipped with large hard disks and multiscanning monitors (two Sony CPD-1302and one NEC MultiSync 3D).andP;  This is the about the minimum practical level ofcomputer power.andP;  Each authoring station was equipped with a Sony SMI-3081motion video overlay board, a typical first-generation product that is widelysupported among authoring systems; by and large, the newer boards such as theVideoLogic DVA-4000 still await the development of appropriate drivers.andO;Three controllable videodisk players (two Sony 1550 and a Sony 1200) andassorted cables rounded out the setup.andM;Right away, we discovered that most of the work lies up front, in theplanning and storyboarding phase.andP;  Our outline became a proposal, ourproposal a flowchart, and the flowchart a storyboard.andP;  Though it may betempting to skip or shorten this procedure, don't do it: you'll need a clearidea of your goal before you start wrestling with the authoring software.andM;To give the file-import capabilities a workout, we developed a range ofgraphics files for the menus, backgrounds, scanned photographs, and otherstill elements of the presentaton.andP;  We used ZSoftr's PC Paintbrush IV Plus tocreate or clean up the images.andP;  We generated both 16-color and 253-color.andO;PCX files for improting into the authoring systems to test the ability ofthese systems to overlay high-resolution graphics on video.andP;  some of theimages were originally in the form of Targa files; we used Videotex'x T-EGAto convert them down to .PCX format.andM;Our presentation begins with an attract loop, a sequence repeated until thecustomer presses a key to begin.andP;  It conststs of the WAP logo with a smallanimated plane, followed by a push frame to video of a plane taking off with&quot;Flee to the Falklands&quot; superimposed.andP;  This allowed us to test a product'sanimation and video overlay support, as well as its keyboard control andgraphics import facilities.andM;After pressing a key, the customer is asked to enter his or her name; thenthe main menu--a scanned image of an airplane cockpit with icons representingthe information choices--appears.andP;  Five icons are included (The Tours,Weather, History, Calendar, and Your Opinion), but, in the interests of time,only the Weather feature was fully implemented.andP;  The various choices give afull workout to the authoring systems' branching support.andM;The Weather option shows a weather video, complete with audio, from anothersection of the laserdisk, and then lets you select information about each ofthe Falklands winter months (June, July, and August).andP;  The information foreach month included a chart, generated in Harvard Graphics and converted to a.PCX file) with overlayed graphics and text.andP;  A final screen displayscomparative information on &quot;Today's Weather&quot; for both New York City and theFalklands.andM;The results?andP;  Well, you'll have to turn to the reviews to find that out.andO;Rest assured, though, that simple as this presentation may sound, it took alot of work to implement provisionally.andP;  Doing it gracefully would requireeven more time and expertise.andP;  Today, multimedia is for the professionaluser.andM;DIGITAL VIDEO ARRIVESandM;High-quality, efficient digital video compression is the Holy Grail ofmultimedia computing.andP;  The prospect of selling millions of computers thatoffer television's uncanny ability to grab attention and motivate is highlyattractive both to computer companies and consumer electronics companies.andO;Whoever wins will sell a lot of hardware one of these days, so it's notsurprising that developers are busy working on digital video standards.andM;ON THE VERGEandM;Today, the front-runner in digital video is Digital Video Interactive (DVI),a compression and playback technology originally developed by RCA's SarnoffResearch Institute and eventually acquired by Intel Corp., which has takenover the DVI research team and the responsibility for developing DVI andbringing it to market.andM;DVI is not a compression technique per se, but a brand name for a set ofprocessor chips that Intel is developing to compress video onto disk and todecompress it for playback in real time at the U.S.andP;  standard motion videorate of 30 frames per second.andP;  The chip set includes both a pixel processor,which performs most of the decompression and also handles special videoeffects, and a display processor, which performs the rest of thedecompression and produces the video output.andM;DVI's greatest long-term advantage is that its microprocessors areprogrammable, so it can be adapted to a variety of compression anddecompression schemes.andP;  The data can even be programmed to tell the DVIprocessors how it was encoded, so that multiple compression schemes can beused on the same disk.andM;Intel officials say that DVI will support as many as six types of compressionin the next few years.andP;  The current standard it uses is a proprietarytechnique called region coding, which works by identifying the areas of avideo image that can be reduced to a small number of bits of data.andP;  DVI alsosaves space by interframe compression, a technique that eliminates the partsof a moving picture that don't change between frames.andM;Compressing the video without losing a substantial amount of informationtakes a lot of horsepower.andP;  To gain the highest quality level of which DVI iscapable, you must perform the compression on a specializedparallel-processing system, for which Intel charges $250 per finished minuteof video.andP;  Once this is done, the results can be stored on a CD-ROM andplayed directly from the CD-ROM disk by any PC equipped with a DVI playbackboard.andP;  Thus, in this mode, DVI is an asymmetrical system.andM;For those who need a symmetrical arrangement, Intel now offers the ProMedia750 a set of boards for about $5,000 that let you both compress anddecompress video on the same PC-based system.andP;  This real-time video is oflower quality than the production-level video that Intel produces off-line, anecessary tradeoff to bring processing requirements within the scope of anordinary PC.andP;  Moreover, real-time video doesn't use interframe compression,so it can't store as much video per megabyte.andP;  But it's good enough for manyuses.andP;  And, it can be stored on ordinary hard disks and distributed overcomputer networks, so it's an important option for authoring and for in-houseapplications like digital teleconferencing.andM;Intel's goal is to put a $1,000 playback board on the market next year, withthe video input board available for another $1,000.andP;  The company forecastssteady improvement in picture quality coupled with fairly rapid pricedeclines.andP;  By 1992 or 1993, Intel hopes to offer a high-quality symmetricalsystem for a few hundred dollars.andM;THE ALTERNATIVESandM;Compact Disc Interactive (CD-I) is most often mentioned as DVI's majorcompetitor, but in fact it's a different approach altogether--and as yet onethat has little relevance to the PC world.andP;  CD-I is being developed primarilyby Philips, with partners Sony and Matsushita, which are carefullypositioning it as a consumer product.andM;In its initial release, CD-I will come in the form of a custom system basedon a Motorola 68000-family processor and a proprietary real-time operatingsystem.andP;  It should be available in the first quarter of next year for about$1,000.andP;  Philips, whose American Interactive Media subsidiary is directingCD-I software development, is focusing on educational and entertainmentapplications.andM;DVI isn't the only digital video standard that applies to PCs, however.andP;  Anew class of compression chips based on an international standard called JPEG(Joint Photographic Experts Group) supports very high-quality video imagesfor applications such as random-access video editing.andP;  The first JPEG chipset has already been announced by C-Cube Corp. of San Jose, California, andothers are expected in the next few months.andM;JPEG chips will simplify the storage of color images, bring electroniccameras into the digital realm, and allow the networking of color printersand scanners.andP;  But the JPEG standard's ability to compress moving images islimited because it's primarily intended for still color-image compression andhence does not take advantage of interframe compression.andP;  Nor does JPEGspecify standards for audio.andM;To get over these limitations, JPEG has spawned a sister committee, calledMPEG (Moving Pictures Experts Group) to work on a standard for motion video.andO;With members from a wide variety of computer and telecommunicationscompanies, MPEG is striving for a symmetrical system.andM;The MPEG committee appears to have settled on a video compression techniquecalled Discrete Cosine Transforms, which uses a complex mathematicalalgorithm to eliminate redundant data in square blocks of pixels.andP;  This isbelieved to have the potential for the highest resolution at the highestcompression rate, but the facts won't be known until the standard is fullydeveloped.andP;  The first MPEG chips are not expected to be built beforemid-1991, and products would follow late next year or in early 1992.andP;  By thattime, Intel plans to support MPEG compression standards on its DVI chips.andM;The best news about JPEG and MPEG is that they're international standards,and their compression technique is compatible with the main teleconferencingstandard.andP;  If they become established, they should eventually be as widelyaccepted as facsimile standards, with, presumably, the same impact on price.andO;Just as fax machines dropped from $10,000 to under $1,000 because ofwidespread world demand, JPEG capability, which next year will probablycommand a $300 to $500 premium in a personal computer, should drop to under$50 in a couple of years.andP;  MPEG can be expected to follow the same kind ofcurve starting in late 1992.andM;A PEEK AT THE COMPETITIONandM;Though multimedia is just beginning to get off the ground on PCs, it'salready flying high on Apple's Macintosh and Commodore's Amiga.andP;  Because boththese platforms have built-in hardware support for coordinated images andsound, as well as a respectable installed base of machines, they've attracteda growing catalog of multimedia authoring tools.andP;  Both also host a good rangeof music creation and editing programs, and with the right software andinterface hardware, both can be used to control videodisc players forinteractive presentations.andM;The Macintosh wasn't originally designed as a multimedia machine, but evenits low-end models offer the basic requisites for simple multimediaapplications.andP;  Two programs especially have brought the Macintosh to the topof the multimedia stack.andM;STANDARD EQUIPMENTandM;The first, of course, is Apple's HyperCard, the &quot;software erector set&quot; thatcomes bundled with every Macintosh.andP;  HyperCard combines a database, scriptinglanguage, screen design editor, and a sound-and-image playback sequencer allin one simple program.andP;  Because it's object-oriented, graphics, sound, andanimation sequences can be incorporated as easily as text, making it anatural for getting one's feet wet in multimedia.andP;  Its simplicity makes it agood prototyping and development tool for people whose primary focus isn'tcomputers, but it's also useful to professional multimedia designers, and forcreating training and academic courseware.andM;HyperCard has merited the sincere flattery of imitation.andP;  Silicon Beach'sSuperCard and Spinnaker Software's Plus are largely compatible supersets ofHyperCard that offer color, larger card sizes, and a larger number of scriptcommands.andP;  Apple also has an upgrade in the works, but delivery of HyperCard2.0 isn't expected until at least this summer.andM;MacroMind's Director is the current hot program for making animatedpresentations combining images and sounds from other programs, as well as forcreating fancy product demonstrations.andP;  It uses a mixed playscript and scoremetaphor in which music-like notation coordinates the activities of &quot;actor&quot;objects and sequences that you create or import into the program.andP;  Thisdesign lets you create anything from dancing snakes to lettering that zoomsand rotates in time with a musical accompaniment.andP;  A new, even more powerfulversion of Director should be shipping by the time you read this.andM;Other multimedia offerings on the Mac run the gamut from the AI-basedMacSmarts from Cognition Technology through the tutorial Point of View fromScholastic Software.andP;  For quick product demonstrations and tutorials,Farallon Computing's ScreenRecorder is gaining a strong following.andP;  Severalother companies make Mac-based multimedia authoring systems, withAuthorware's Authorware Professional, Edudisc's Mentor, and TeleRobotic'sCourse Builder among the better known.andM;HIGHLY PRESENTABLEandM;On the Commodore side of the house, the Amiga has been best known for itscomputer-to-video hardware links.andP;  It now supports a growing number ofrespectable software packages.andP;  Amiga titling and animation packages havebeen popular in both industry and small-scale television production, butCommodore has particularly high hopes for its new authoring program calledAmigaVision, which was just about ready for release at the time this articlewent to press.andM;Much like AimTech's IconAuthor on the PC or Authorware Professional on theMac, AmigaVision lets you create a teaching or training document by draggingicons that represent actions onto a page to form a flowchart.andP;  The programthen &quot;plays&quot; your presentation by following the flowchart from top left tobottom right.andM;The elements you can work with include display options (such as showing agraphic or block of text), control options (such as playing a video clip on avideodisc drive), navigation options (including loops and subroutines), andinputs (such as reacting to user inputs such as mouse clicks or keystrokes).andO;If you have a touchscreen, AmigaVision will use that as well.andP;  The programeven has its own modest database.andM;AmigaVision has a limited ability to create simple display screens directlyin the program, but it's really meant to be used in conjunction with othergraphics, sound, and writing products.andP;  With the Amiga's multitaskingoperating system, it's easy to bounce back and forth between AmigaVision anda product such as Electronic Art's DeluxePaint III.andP;  AmigaVision even letsyou select different types of images and different screen modes for eachscreen you display.andM;The Amiga supports close to half a dozen other software packages that let youarrange sound and picture for multimedia presentations.andP;  Along withDeluxePaint III, they include Animation: Sound Track from Hash Enterprises,The Director from Right Answers Group, MovieSetter from Gold Disk, and PhotonVideo: Cel Animator from Micro-Illusions.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
