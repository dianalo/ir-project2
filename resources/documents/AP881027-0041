The Wilderness Society, in a report, recommended the Fish andWildlife Service find ways to better protect water quality on refugelands and give refuge managers more control.   The Wildlife Service, in response, said the problems cited by theconservation group ``are not new, nor are they being ignored.'' Theservice manages 445 refuges.   In no particular order, here are the 10 most endangered refugesas listed by the Wilderness Society.   _Kesterson, California. Described as ``in a coma'' because ofselenium poisoning from irrigation runoff that has killed thousandsof ducks and other waterfowl.   _National Key Deer, Florida. As many as 20 percent of the deer inthis western Florida Keys refuge are killed by cars each year.   _Loxahatchee, Florida. Nearby development has drastically changedwater flow patterns in this Everglades region, bringing periods ofboth excessive and insufficient flow. The water is contaminated byheavy fertilizer use.   _Stillwater, Nevada. It has become a chemical ``dumping ground''for the Newlands irrigation project. Mercury in fish has been foundat up to four times the amount permitted for human consumption.   _Chincoteague, Virginia. A growing visitor population has putpressure on wildlife nesting.   _Yazoo, Mississippi. Agricultural runoff is carrying highconcentrations of pesticides into the refuge.   _Arctic, Alaska. Oil companies and the Interior Department wantto explore for oil near the coast of the Beaufort Sea, whichCongress has not permitted.   _Lower Rio Grande, Texas. Nearby pesticide spraying and runoff,wastewater discharges and planned real estate development are themajor threats.   _Upper Mississippi River, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota andIllinois. Soil erosion is damaging habitat and reproduction.Wastewater and pesticide-loaded agricultural runoff is pollutingrefuge waters and heavy recreation use is hurting habitat.   _Great Swamp, New Jersey. Population growth 26 miles west ofManhattan is straining two sewage treatment plants whose outfloweventually reaches the refuge. Road salt, fertilizer and pesticidesare reaching the refuge. Old toxic dumps threaten contamination ofthe water. Water flow is increasingly variable.   The society identified these other wildlife refuges that it saidhad less severe, but still serious, problems: Fallon, Nevada;Bowdoin, Montana; Hakalau Forest, Hawaii; Upper Souris and J. ClarkSalyer, North Dakota; Ouray, Wyoming; Kenai, Alaska and Tule Lake,California.</TEXT></DOC>
