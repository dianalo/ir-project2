The situation today standsin marked contrast. A number of divergent research areas, spanning awide range of biological interests from ecology at one extreme to molecularbiology at the other extreme, are flourishing. This diversity of researchactivity has been identified as tangible evidence of the health of thepopulation genetics research program in the published summary of a recentNational Institutes of Health-sponsored workshop on population genetics.This review provides a brief account of several divergent areas of recentresearch activity in population genetics to illustrate the breadth ofcontemporary research in this field.</TEXT></DOC>
