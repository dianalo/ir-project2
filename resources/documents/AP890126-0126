The surprisingly strong increase was the biggest since an 8.7percent rise last June and brought demand for durable goods, itemsexpected to last three or more years, to a seasonally adjusted$130.85 billion in December.   The figures reflected widespread demand in both civilian andmilitary categories. Non-electrical machinery was the only categoryto post a decline.   Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc. inLexington, Mass., said the report indicates that ``so far, there'scertainly not any signs of slowdown'' in the economy.   But she cautioned, ``While it's very strong on the surface, thedisturbing undertone is that machine orders were off.''   December's orders closed out the year on a strong note, withdemand over the last 12 months totaling $1.43 trillion, a 10.8percent increase from 1987, when orders had been up 7.6 percent overthe previous year.   Last year's pace was the best showing since a 12.3 percentincrease in 1984.   Orders had edged up just 1.2 percent in 1985 and 0.4 percent in1986, when America was losing both domestic and overseas sales toforeign manufacturers.   But U.S. manufacturers have enjoyed an export-led rebound thelast two years as a decline in the value of the dollar againstforeign currencies made American products more competitive overseas.   Economist John Hagens of the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., saidthe health of the U.S. manufacturing industry in 1988 showed that,``at a good price, U.S. goods can hold their own in the worldmarket.''   Hagens said that with the dollar unlikley to fall further, ``thephenomenal growth in orders and exports generally is not going to bethere for 1989'' but that orders still should come in at a moderatepace.   In other reports Thursday, the Labor Department said:   _The prices Americans paid for imported goods rose 4.1 percentduring 1988, with prices up 1.6 percent in the final three months ofthe year.   The fall of the dollar, while improving the competitiveness ofU.S. goods overseas and helping to lower the trade deficit, alsoboosts the price of foreign goods in American markets.   _First-year pay raises averaged 2.6 percent for workers inprivate industry affected by collective bargaining settlementssigned last year. For the full term of major contracts settled lastyear, wage increases averaged 2.4 percent.   December's increase in orders for durable goods was paced by ahuge jump in the volatile military category, which oscillatesdepending on when big government contracts are signed. Militaryorders increased 21.1 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted$10.16 billion after a 21.5 percent decrease in November.   Even excluding defense, however, orders for durable goods were up5.4 percent in December.   In another erratic category, transportation orders increased 20percent in December to $38.88 billion after a 7.2 percent decrease amonth earlier. The improvement included large gains in the auto,aircraft and shipbuilding industries.   Excluding transportation, the December increase in orders fordurale goods was 1.6 percent.   There also was strength in orders for non-defense capital goods,a category that is closely watched for signs of business intentionsto expand and modernize. Demand in this category rose 7.8 percent to$38.58 billion last month, the steepest increase since a 12.5percent jump in June.   In other industries, orders for primary metals rose 5.3 percentto $13.30 billion and demand for electrical machinery was up 1.1percent to $20.34 billion. Orders for non-electrical machinerydropped 3.2 percent to $20.71 billion; most of that decline was inengines and turbines.   Shipments of durable goods overall rose 3.8 percent to $124.46billion in December, following a 1.2 percent increase in November.   Shipments for the year totaled $1.39 trillion, up 9.9 percentfrom 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
