TheCommission's prior practice of considering certain offsite elements oflicensee's plans has been modified and codified in this regard to providethat NRC findings will be required before fuel loading or low power testingin coordination with offsite personnel and agencies so that necessary resourcescan be applied on site for mitigating and containing accidents, and sothat offsite agencies may be kept informed of plant events. The rule willalso change the prior practice, never included in the prior rule itself,of reviewing plans for prompt public notification in the event of an accident.This practice of reviewing an offsite element of licensee emergency plansthat has no onsite application is being discontinued as not necessary forpublic safety. The rule does not change the emergency planning requirementsthat must be satisfied before full power operation can be authorized. Nonew requirements are being imposed by the rule beyond those that have beenpreviously required by rule and by prior NRC practice. The rule makes clearthat no offsite elements of the applicant's emergency plan, other thanthose set forth in this revised rule, need be considered in connectionwith low power licensing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>October 24, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Carole F.

Background </ITAG>On May 9, 1988, the Commission published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 16435) a notice of proposed rulemakingwhich would establish more clearly what emergency planning and preparednessrequirements are needed for fuel loading and low power testing of nuclearpower plants. As detailed in the notice of proposed rulemaking, 10 CFR50.47(d) as promulgated on July 13, 1982 (47 FR 30232) provided that onlya finding as to the adequacy of an applicant's onsite emergency planningand preparedness is required for low power. However, the provision in theStatement of Considerations that systems for prompt notice to the publicin the event of an accident would also be reviewed before low power focusedon protection of persons <T3>off site. </T3>The Statement of Considerations for the 1982 rule changegave no clear and consistent rationale for why the particular element dealingwith public notification should be included. The foundation for that rulemakingwas the Commission's determination, described in more detail below, thatthe degree of emergency planning and preparedness necessary to provideadequate protection of the public health and safety is significantly lessthan that required for full power operation in light of the significantlylower risks associated with even low likelihood accidents at that stage(47 FR 30233 and note 1). Thus, the stated rationale for the 1982 rulewould seem to undercut the need for any prompt public notification requirement.The Commission indicated in 1982 that, although at low power plant operatorstypically have less experience and there is a greater potential for undiscovereddefects, the risk to public health and safety at low power is significantlylower than at full power as a result of several factors. Those reasonswere stated by the Commission as follows: First, the fission product inventoryduring low power testing is much less than during higher power operationdue to the low level of reactor power and short period of operation. Second,at low power there is a significant reduction in the required capacityof systems designed to mitigate the consequences of accidents comparedto the required capacities under full power operation. Third, the time available for taking actions to identify accident causesand mitigate accident consequences is much longer than at full power. Thismeans that operators should have sufficient time to prevent a radioactiverelease from occurring. In the worst case, the additional time available(at least 10 hours), even for a postulated low likelihood sequence whichcould eventually result in release of the fission products accumulatedat low power into the containment, would allow adequate precautionary actionsto be taken to protect the public near the site (47 FR 30233). The safety basis for the 1982 rule was reviewed as a necessary part ofthe instant proposed rulemaking. The Commission reexamined the need atlow power to review those aspects of applicants' onsite plans that seemrelevant only to offsite protective measures that might be needed if therewere an accident with offsite dose effects (53 FR 16436-7). The proposedrule indicated that the Commission saw no need to review those aspectsof applicants' plans that did not have a direct relationship to onsitedose effects in light of the significantly less risk to offsite personspresented by fuel loading and low power testing as contrasted with fullpower operation. On reexamination in light of public comment, the Commissionhas reaffirmed the safety conclusion that the safety risk to the publicfrom low power testing is significantly less than the risk to the publicfrom full power operation. Accordingly, the rule is being issued in finalform substantially as proposed. However, a number of changes have beenmade in the rule in response to public comments. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Analysis of Public Comments </ITAG>Nearly 1700 comments were received on the proposed rulemaking. The overwhelmingmajority were from private citizens, mostly in the New England area. Commentsalso came from utilities, industry groups, State and local government agenciesand officials, members of Congress, one Federal agency and several localand national environmental groups. The comments ran approximately two toone in favor of promulgation of the proposed rule. Of those opposed, approximately500 were form letters from residents of the area surrounding the Seabrooknuclear power plant. The remaining 60 to 70 comments in opposition werefrom private citizens, State and local government officials and environmentalgroups. The comments in favor came primarily from private citizens, witha sprinkling from utilities, nuclear industry organizations, one localgovernment official and one Federal agency. Because of the large volume of comments received, it would be impracticalto discuss each individually. The great majority of comments, both forand against the proposed rule, turned on the commenter's opinion on theimpact of the rule on licensing the Seabrook facility. Most of the individualswho wrote in support of the rule expressed the opinion that the facilitywas ready to be licensed, that the power the facility would generate wasneeded, and that licensing should not be allowed to be held up by politicalforces. Most commenters in favor of the rule also expressed the opinionthat the risks to the public from low power testing were considerably lessthan those from full power operation, and that prompt emergency notificationto the general public should not be necessary at low power. The significant comments against the rule fall within the scope of fifteenseparate major comments. These major comments and the Commission's responseto them are set forth below.<T3>Comment 1. </T3>The risk assessments upon which the rule is based arebased on operation over a short time frame. However, there is no time limitfor low power testing. <T3>Response. </T3>For many years, Commission policy has been to issueseparate ``low power'' licenses which allow a plant to load fuel and performtesting and operator training at power levels up to 5 percent wheneverto do so would expedite the licensing process without prejudicing the rightsof any intervening parties. The purpose of the low power test program isto demonstrate that the overall plant performance conforms to the establisheddesign criteria and to confirm the operability of plant systems and designfeatures that could not be completely tested during the preoperationaltest phase. Tests that are performed during the program are specific tothe type of light-water reactor (boiling water reactor versus pressurizedwater reactor), but typically include determination of in-core flux distribution,moderator temperature coefficients, control rod worths and adequacy ofneutron instrumentation and associated protective functions. Also, duringthis time operators obtain some valuable additional training manipulatingthe controls of the reactor at low power levels. In practice, many of thesetests and manipulations are performed with the reactor at less than 1 percentof rated power, and those tests and manipulations which are performed withthe reactor at ``peak'' low power (typically 3 percent to 4 percent ofrated power) are completed within a day or two. Based on experience withU.S. commercial power plant startup test programs, the period over whicha reactor would actually operate at or near 5 percent power during thelow power test program is expected to be at most a few weeks; likewise,operation at 5 percent power beyond these few weeks would not be economicallyfeasible. The safety evaluation supporting this rule assumes that operationunder the rule would be consistent with this prior history and practice.To further clarify this  point, low power licenses issued under this rulewill be for purposes of fuel loading and low power testing and operatortraining only: steady-state operation at or near 5 percent for the fulllicense term would not be authorized. <T3>Comment 2. </T3>The technical basis for both the current rule and the1982 rule is flawed in that, at 5 percent power, substantial inventoriesof biologically significant fission products will be developed in fromeight to forty days. Thus, while the inventory of all radionuclides developedduring low power testing is reduced compared to full power operation, theinventory of radionuclides with public health significance still posesa substantial prompt public health hazard. In addition, the inexperienceof the operators during low power testing and the newness of the systemcreate a greater potential for undiscovered defects and incidents. <T3>Response. </T3>Yes, there are some biologically significant fissionproducts generated in the reactor core during the low power operation contemplatedby this rule. But, although during low power testing plant operators typicallyhave less experience and there is a greater potential for undiscovereddefects, the risk at low power is still sufficiently low to provide reasonableassurance that public health and safety is protected even in the absenceof the requirement for a prompt notification system and other purely offsiteelements of emergency plans. This is a result of three factors, which werestated earlier by the Commission and which the Commission reaffirms inthis rulemaking as follows: First, the fission product inventory duringinitial low power testing is much less than during higher power operationdue to the low level of reactor power and short period of operation atthis power level. The available inventory of fission products that aresignificant contributors to public health consequences would be reducedby about a factor of 20 for continuous operation at 5 percent power comparedto continuous full power operation. However, as explained above, basedon experience with commercial nuclear power plant startup test programs,operation at or near 5 percent power is only expected for a maximum ofa few weeks. This would result in a further reduction in available fissionproduct inventory. Second, at low power there is a significant reductionin the required capacity of systems designed to mitigate the consequencesof accidents compared to the required capacities under full power operation.For example, the coolant flow required to dissipate decay heat at 10 hoursfollowing a loss of coolant accident in a typical pressurized water reactorwould be less than 10 gallons per minute, which is well within the capacityof normal make-up systems. Most of the regulatory requirements for safetysystems during reactor power operation, including containment integrity,emergency core cooling, and redundant power supplies, are the same for5 percent power operation as they are for 100 percent power. Third, thetime available for taking actions to identify accident causes and mitigateaccident consequences is much longer than at full power. This means theoperators should have sufficient time to prevent a radioactive releasefrom occurring.The above safety evaluation makes no assumptions about the time that wouldbe needed to notify the public off site and to implement an offsite emergencyresponse if one would assume hypothetically that an offsite release wouldoccur: it is based solely on an analysis of the likelihood that an offsiterelease could occur and of the possible magnitude of that release. However,as an additional, separate consideration, the Commission also believesthat, in the worst case, the additional time available (at least 10 hours),even for a postulated low likelihood sequence which could eventually resultin release of the fission products accumulated at low power into the containment,would allow notification of both onsite and offsite emergency responseorganizations. These organizations would likely have adequate time to implementsome offsite response should that be necessary. Without a prompt publicnotification system in place and an approved and tested offsite emergencyplan, there obviously cannot be the same kind of reasonable assurance ofoffsite protective measures that there would be with a fully reviewed andtested offsite emergency plan should there be an offsite release at lowpower. However, given the extremely low likelihood of any accident resultingin significant offsite releases, the requirements for procedures to notifyemergency response organizations and the additional time that will likelybe available would provide sufficient time for the emergency response organizationsto implement some form of public notification and to carry out some reasonablyeffective offsite emergency response, even if such a release were to eventuallyoccur. <T3>Comment 3. </T3>Testing at low power is riskier than full power operationbecause it involves deliberately defeating safety systems.<T3>Response. </T3>While some selected safety systems may be disabled duringlow power testing, the heat load and fission product inventory are significantlyless than at full power. There are a number of methods available to removethis very low heat load generated at low power. In addition, special proceduresare developed and followed for these tests, which are closely monitoredby plant personnel. Therefore, because of the reduced heat load, smallfission product inventory and special attention by plant operators, testingat low power does not place the plant at greater risk and presents a significantlylesser risk than does full power operation. <T3>Comment 4. </T3>The Chernobyl accident occurred while the reactor wasat low power. Why does the NRC still say that the risk of low power testingis low? <T3>Response. </T3>The reactor physics characteristics of U.S. light-waterreactors are very different from those of the graphite-moderated RBMK typeof reactor at Chernobyl. Positive void (and moderator temperature) coefficients,which played a central role in the accident at Chernobyl, are generallyabsent in U.S. reactors. Where they are present, they have a limited reactivityinsertion potential, which precludes their causing any significant reactivitytransient and power level increase. Substantial required shutdown reactivitymargins in conjunction with fast automatic insertion of control rods onsignals indicative of unsafe conditions provide protection against theoccurrence of reactivity excursions, such as that which took place at Chernobyl,in commercial U.S. reactors. U.S. light-water reactors do not have theinherent potential to rapidly elevate their reactor power to levels atwhich plant risk becomes significant. Additionally, the Chernobyl reactoroperated at full power prior to its accident. Therefore, the buildup offission product inventory was much higher than the buildup of fission productinventory at U.S. reactor operating under a fuel loading or low power testinglicense. <T3>Comment 5. </T3>Low power licensing fails the cost-benefit analysisrequired by NEPA. <T3>Response. </T3>This issue falls outside the scope of this rulemaking,which is only designed to address the requirements under the Atomic EnergyAct for emergency planning at fuel loading and low power. The establishmentof these safety requirements does not have a significant environmentalimpact under NEPA. The question of the correct NEPA analysis to be donein support of a low power license for any specific facility is made bycase-by-case determination, and is not the subject of this rulemaking.<T3>Comment 6. </T3>A low power license should not be issued where it isnot certain that a full power license will ever be granted. The Shorehamreactor was irradiated unnecessarily. <T3>Response. </T3>This again is an issue that is not the subject of thisgeneric rulemaking. In the past the Commission has addressed this issuein individual adjudicatory opinions, <T3>e.g., Long Island Lighting Company </T3>(Shoreham Nuclear Power Station),CLI-85-12, 21 NRC 1587 (1985), and does not believe that the issue warrantsresolution generically by rulemaking. <T3>Comment 7. </T3>The proposed rule states that the safety analysis performedin 1982 is still valid. After performing that analysis, the NRC decidedto require that certain offsite aspects of emergency plans be in placeprior to low power licensing. The NRC has given no rationale for changingthe rule, while admitting that the previous analysis is valid. <T3>Response. </T3>One reason for this rule change is to clarify languagein the rule itself that can easily be read to suggest that <T3>no </T3>offsite emergency planning elements need to be reviewed priorto fuel loading or low power testing. The 1982 safety analysis supportedthe proposition that those offsite aspects of emergency planning whichare pertinent to protecting persons on site need be considered prior tolow power. This rule change will incorporate this important safety consideration.The provision in the 1982 rulemaking which is being reconsidered is theprovision in the Supplemental Information that systems for prompt notificationof the public in the event of an accident should be in place and reviewedat low power. However, this change is consistent with the 1982 safety analysis.Plans will still be required for notification of offsite planning and responseagencies so that these agencies and licensees may, as appropriate, keepthe media and the public informed. But given the relatively low risk tothe public from low power operation, a requirement for prompt notificationof the public is far in excess of what is reasonably needed. Nothing inthe 1982 rulemaking logically supports the contrary. <T3>Comment 8. </T3>The NRC has previously stated that review of the licensee'sonsite response mechanism will necessarily include aspects of some offsiteelements. Why is the NRC changing this position? <T3>Response. </T3>See the Response to Concern 7. The NRC is not changingits expert conclusion as to the lower level of risk from low power operation.However, this rulemaking is a more logical result of this expert conclusionthan the positions stated in the 1982 Supplemental Information. <T3>Comment 9. </T3>The new rule does not address the risk of a terroristattack or sabotage at low power. <T3>Response. </T3>Prior to receiving a low power license, a licensee mustfully meet the requirements of 10 CFR 73.55. These requirements assurethe implementation of an acceptable security plan around a nuclear powerplant. These are the same security requirements that a licensee must meetprior to receiving a full power license. While the risk from terrorismor sabotage cannot be quantified, it is the Commission's judgment thatcompliance with andSection; 73.55 will reasonably assure that the risk fromterrorism or sabotage at low power is sufficiently low so as not to undercutthe conclusion that low power safety risks to the offsite public are relativelylow. <T3>Comment 10. </T3>The risks of an accident at low power are not confinedto those onsite. If an accident were to occur at low power, public paniccould ensue.<T3>Response. </T3>The Commission responded to a similar comment in promulgatingthe 1982 rule. <T3>See </T3>Issue 6, 47 FR at 30234. The Commission is not unmindful that,regardless of the objective lack of danger, members of the public may bemade uneasy and could panic unnecessarily if an accident were to occurat low power. It was in response to this comment that the Commission agreedto review, and will continue to review, certain offsite notification elementsof emergency plans prior to low power testing. In particular, prior tolow power, means to keep state and local response organizations informedin the event of an onsite accident will be reviewed and approved. Theseorganizations, through. normal communication mechanisms, have the capabilityto inform the public, if needed, in order to avert panic. However, theCommission has found that the immediate direct notification of the publiccalled for by the language in the 1982 rule preamble is far in excess ofwhat is necessary to keep the public informed. <T3>Comment 11. </T3>The change in proposed andSection; 50.47(d)(5) to modifythe requirement for provisions for monitoring offsite consequences from``in use'' to ``available'' will create unacceptable delay in the identificationof an actual or potential hazard to the public stemming from a radiologicalemergency. <T3>Response. </T3>The final rule will retain the phrase ``in use''. Thewording change in the proposed rule was not intended to change currentNRC staff practice of reviewing licensee onsite plans to assure they meetthe intent of andSection; 50.47(b)(9) and Planning Standard I of NUREG-0654prior to issuance of an operating license limited to fuel loading and lowpower testing. While the safety evaluation which supports the eliminationof the prompt public notification requirement for low power suggests thatan offsite release is extremely unlikely, the Commission still considersit prudent to have release monitoring equipment in use on site so that,at a minimum, the licensee is in a position to verify objectively thatno release has occurred. <T3>Comment 12. </T3>The original rule justified retention of emergencyplanning for research reactors, but not for commercial reactors, sinceresearch reactors were perceived to be located in areas of high populationdensity. This contradicts the Commission's current posture that the relativelylower risks of low power testing justify elimination of offsite safetymeasures, since it concedes that there is an accident risk at low powerserious enough that a research reactor (much smaller than a power reactor)needs a full emergency plan. <T3>Response. </T3>The premise for the comment that research reactors withpower levels approximating those of commercial nuclear power plants operatingat 5 percent of full power are required to have approved offsite emergencyplans is incorrect. Rather than requiring a ``full emergency plan'' forresearch reactors, the Commission's regulations (10 CFR Part 50, AppendixE, 10 CFR 50.47(c), 10 CFR 50.54(q)) provide that emergency plan requirementswill be determined on a case-by-case basis. In making this determinationthe guidance of NRC Regulatory Guide 2.6 and American National StandardsInstitute/American Nuclear Society 15.16 is used. In accordance with thisguidance, and based on the relatively small risks posed by typical researchreactors, (i.e., less than 50 megawatts) emergency planning involving offsitestate and local plans and public notification has not been required. Theguidance does, however, provide for consideration of more extensive planning,including all or a portion of the requirements listed in section IV of10 CFR Part 50, Appendix E for research reactors with power levels greaterthan 50 megawatts. This graded approach to required emergency planningis consistent with the current rule.  <T3>Comment 13. </T3>The Atomic Energy Act prohibits authorization of lowpower testing prior to completion of public hearings on all issues materialto full power licensing. <T3>Response. </T3>This comment is more properly addressed to andSection;50.57(c), which provides for low power licenses and which is not beingamended here. That section provides that a hearing is required prior tolow power on those contentions ``relevant to the activity to be authorized''_thatis, low power testing, as opposed to full power operation. <T3>Comment 14. </T3>The proposed rule was designed to allow the Seabrookfacility to receive its low power license. The Commission should promulgatea rule to promote the public health and safety and not one designed tolicense a specific facility. The issue should be addressed in the pendingSeabrook adjudication, not in a rulemaking. <T3>Response. </T3>In the proposed rule, the Commission stated that itsattention was focused on the emergency planning requirements for low powertesting because of an Appeal Board decision in the Seabrook operating licenseproceeding, ALAB-883. And, for the near term, the only reasonably foreseeableeffect of the rule change will be on the Seabrook low power application.But this does not make the use of rulemaking inappropriate. As the Commissionexplained, the rule change was proposed to correct a possible discrepancybetween the language of the 1982 rule and the language of the Statementof Considerations which potentially affects all license applicants, notjust the applicants for Seabrook. Also, the questions involved in the proposedrule are generic safety questions and the Commission preferred to obtain(and, in fact, did obtain) a broad spectrum of public comment, rather thanjust the comments of the litigants in the Seabrook proceeding. The Commission is free to address a generic issue generically, even ifthe rule change may currently apply only to one facility. <T3>See, e.g., Siegel v. Atomic Energy Commission, </T3>400 F.2d 778 (D.C.Cir. 1968). <T3>Also see Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chenery, </T3>332 U.S.194, 202 (1947) (choice of how to proceed lies within the informed discretionof the agency).The rule is not intended to overrule <T3>Public Service Company of New Hampshire, et al. </T3>(Seabrook Station,Units 1 and 2), CLI-87-2, 25 NRC 267 or CLI-87-3, 25 NRC 875 (1987). <T3>Comment 15. </T3>Members of the public may need immediate medical attentionin the event of an accident at low power. The new rule does not providethat arrangements for medical services will be in place for those off site.<T3>Response. </T3>The purpose for the requirement in 10 CFR 50.47(b)(12)that arrangements for medical services be made was described in the ``<T2>Summary</T2>'' section of the Commission's policy statement on medicalservices (51 FR 32904) dated September 17, 1986, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (``NRC'' or ``Commission'') believesthat 10 CFR 50.47(b)(12) (``planning standard (b)(12)'') requires pre-accidentarrangements for medical services (beyond the maintenance of a list oftreatment facilities) for individuals who might be severely exposed todangerous levels of offsite radiation following an accident at a nuclearpower plant.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">However, it is highly unlikely that members of the general publicwould be exposed to dangerous levels of radiation following an accidentat low power. Therefore, the safety premise for the full power requirementthat arrangements be made for medical services does not apply to fuel loadingor low power testing. Conclusion As indicated in the responses to the comments, the Commission has decidedto proceed with the proposed rule change with some clarifications and modifications.The rule reconciles a discrepancy between the language of the Commission's1982 emergency planning rule change and the language of the SupplementalInformation and provides an interpretation of that rule which appears tobe fully consistent with the Commission's goals and safety conclusionsin 1982. The majority of the public, as expressed in the comments, supportsthe rule. The comments opposing the rule have given no sound reasons forthe Commission to alter its basic course. <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability </ITAG>The Commission has determined that under the National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in Subpart Aof 10 CFR Part 51, this rule, if adopted, would not be a major Federalaction significantly affecting the quality of the human environment andtherefore an environmental impact statement is not required. The environmentalassessment and finding of no significant impact on which this determinationis based are available for inspection at the NRC Public Document Room,2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act Statement </ITAG>This final rule does not contain a new or amended information collectionrequirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3>). Existing requirements were approved by the Office ofManagement and Budget, approval number 3150-0011. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Analysis </ITAG>The Commission has prepared a regulatory analysis for this final regulation.The analysis examines the costs and benefits of the alternatives consideredby the Commission. The analysis is available for inspection in the NRCPublic Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC. Single copiesof the analysis may be obtained from Michael T. Jamgochian, Office of NuclearRegulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC20555; Telephone (301) 492-3918. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Certification </ITAG>This final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial numberof small entities. The final rule will reduce or at least postpone theburden on NRC licensees by reducing the process required before a low powerlicense may be granted. Nuclear power plant licensees do not fall withinthe definition of small businesses in section 3 of the Small Business Act,15 U.S.C. 632, the Small Business Size Standards of the Small BusinessAdministration in 13 CFR Part 121, or the Commission's Size Standards publishedat 50 FR 50241 (Dec. 9, 1985). Therefore, in accordance with the RegulatoryFlexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission hereby certifiesthat the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities and that, therefore, a regulatory flexibilityanalysis need not be prepared. <ITAG tagnum="84">Backfit Analysis </ITAG>The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not applyto this final rule, and therefore, that a backfit analysis is not requiredfor this final rule because these amendments do not involve any provisionswhich would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 50 </ITAG>Antitrust, Classified information, Fire protection, Intergovernmental relations,Nuclear power plants and reactors, Penalty, Radiation protection, Reactorsiting criteria, Reporting record keeping requirements.For the reasons set out in the preamble and under the authority of theAtomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Energy Reorganization Act of1974, as amended, and 5 U.S.C. 552 and 553, the Commission is adoptingthe following amendments to Part 50. <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 50_DOMESTIC LICENSING OF PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION FACILITIES</ITAG>1.
