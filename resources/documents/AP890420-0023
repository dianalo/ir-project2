The legislation ``will help prevent our law enforcement officersfrom being gunned down by drug dealers,'' Sen. Howard M.Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, declared as a Senate Judiciary subcommitteecleared both his measure and a rival version 5-1.   The panel's action, which did not include a recommendation ofapproval, places the issue before the full Senate JudiciaryCommittee, which is expected to take up the measures next month.   Metzenbaum's bill, which has been modified somewhat over thelast week, would ban sales of new assault weapons but not transfersof ones that already are owned by the public. It would requireowners selling their guns to keep a record to make it easier totrace firearms found at crime scenes.   The measure also would require a 14-day waiting period beforetransfers. It specifies a list of 26 assault guns ranging from theAKS, a semiautomatic cousin of the Soviet infantryman's AK47, tosinister-looking Street Sweeper and Striker 12 round-drummedshotguns.   Also approved by the panel was a rival version sponsored by Sen.Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., that specifies nine guns the senatorsays are frequently used by narcotics gangs. It does not include awaiting period for transfers.   In approving both bills without a recommendation, thesubcommittee on the Constitution merely put off resolving thedisputes between the two, as well as the inevitable battle withforces opposed to any crackdown on assault weapons. Sen. OrrinHatch, R-Utah, vowed to introduce still another bill that wouldtake the stress off of gun control and put the emphasis on crimecontrol.   ``The only assault these so-called assault weapons bills make ison the legitimate, law-abiding citizens,'' Hatch declared. He saidboth measures would ``transgress the Second Amendment rights (tobear arms) guaranteed to all law-abiding citizens in our society.''   Defining assault weapons has posed a major problem for theircritics, but they generally are semiautomatic rifles and pistolswith military styling as well as folding and plastic stocks,forward hand grips and other features more often seen in Rambomovies than in a traditional woodsman's gun rack.   Crack gangs warring over turf have been using the rapid-firing,high-powered weapons to spray street corners in some communities.But authorities also say there is no functional difference betweenthe assault rifles and the semiautomatic versions of traditionalhunting rifles with their brown wooden stocks.   The National Rifle Association has been highly critical ofMetzenbaum's bill, and DeConcini said he expected the same kind ofopposition to his measure, even though he has a strong pro-gunvoting record. Metzenbaum registered a strongly worded complaintagainst the power of gun groups.   ``As I know so well, any legislative initiative dealing withfirearms, no matter how modest and reasonable, is inevitablyattacked by the gun lobby as a threat to sportsmen and legitimategun owners,'' he said. ``I am sure Sen. DeConcini will be attackedas well, even though he has introduced a modest and carefulmeasure.''   Lawmakers are also divided over whether they should await a cuefrom President Bush before taking the next step.   ``I think we can make up our minds without hearing fromPresident Bush on this,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.   He urged speed, saying that ``the American people want action.''   ``We didn't have the guts to face up to the handguns and theissue of concealable guns and now the question is whether we aregoing to have the guts to face up to assault weapons,'' he said.   DeConcini and Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., however, said lawmakersshould get Bush administration input lest the president veto thefinished product. They said support to override a veto and passsuch a bill over the president's objections could well be missing.   ``If we don't think we've got the administration's support, Idon't think we can push a bill,'' DeConcini said.   The administration has banned imports of many assault weaponsbut many of them are made in America.   The Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco andFirearms says that before Bush imposed his temporary import ban,foreign-made weapons accounted for about 25 percent of the Americanmarket.</TEXT></DOC>
