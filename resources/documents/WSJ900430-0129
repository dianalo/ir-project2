Despite a power shortage affecting most of the main islandof Luzon and continuing rumors of another coup attempt, &quot;Istill think the Philippines is an attractive place toinvest,&quot; he said in an interview in Hong Kong, where he wastraveling on business.</LP><TEXT>   A former U.S. attorney general and defense secretary andnow a Washington-based lawyer, Mr. Richardson is the specialrepresentative of President Bush to the MultilateralAssistance Initiative for the Philippines, a World Bank-ledconsortium of 19 donor countries and a half-dozenmultilateral agencies. The group was formed in July 1989 tocoordinate foreign-aid programs and attract more overseasinvestment to alleviate poverty in the Philippines.   The group pledged $3.3 billion in economic aid for thePhilippines in 1990; it will hold a pledge meeting for 1991aid sometime in this year's second half. Japan is the biggestdonor, with about $1 billion pledged, followed by the WorldBank and the Asian Development Bank.   The Bush administration pledged $200 million to theassistance initiative this year, but Congress approved only$160 million. However, with military aid, the U.S. iscontributing $545 million in direct assistance.   Mr. Richardson said the Bush administration is proposing$200 million for 1991. He plans to take up the proposal withcongressional leaders soon.   The renegotiation of a lease on U.S. military bases in thePhilippines won't affect the Bush administration's economicaid program, he said. However, he acknowledged that Congressmay cut economic assistance if the U.S. is required toprovide more military aid in return for extending the basesagreements beyond the 1991 expiration date. Preliminary talkson the leases are to begin May 14.   Mr. Richardson, who was in Manila at the onset of the coupattempt in December, repeated earlier warnings fromWashington that U.S. aid to the Philippines will be cut offby law if there is a successful coup against PresidentCorazon Aquino. He said other donors likely would halt aid,too.   But Mr. Richardson said the likelihood of a successfulputsch diminishes as the 1992 presidential election growsnearer. He also said the Philippine business community &quot;isincreasingly well aware that the prospects for the Philippineeconomy are good if they can sustain progress along presentlines. There is great potential for disaster if a coupattempt should succeed.&quot;   Since coming to power in 1986, the Aquino government hasbeaten back six coup attempts by rebel soldiers. The Decembercoup was the most serious, claiming more than 100 lives. Mr.Richardson likened rebel leaders, several of whom remain atlarge, to 1930s Italian fascists, &quot;whose only program was tomake the trains run on time.&quot;   Despite persistent rumors of a seventh coup, Mr.Richardson said foreign companies are still consideringinvestments in the Philippines, attracted by the country'seducated, largely English-speaking work force. He citedcontinued interest especially from companies in Taiwan and inHong Kong, where he met with territory-based investors duringhis visit.   However, Mr. Richardson called the electricity shortagethat has led to a temporary four-day workweek in Manila an&quot;embarrassing development&quot; that should have been foreseen bythe Aquino government when it shelved a controversial nuclearpower plant.   But he said the power shortage was &quot;correctable&quot; in time,adding that much of the foreign aid is aimed at improvinginfrastructure.   More than coup attempts, he said, donors are concernedabout improving the speed and efficiency of the use offoreign-aid money in the Philippines. &quot;The most significantconcern of the donors in general and the U.S. Congress inparticular is the pipeline problem,&quot; Mr. Richardson said. Buthe added that the Aquino government was working to removebottlenecks delaying aid dispersal.</TEXT></DOC>
