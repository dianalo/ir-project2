Potential workplace exposures included welding fumes,cutting oils, asbestos, organic solvents, and environmental ionizingradiation, as the result of disposal of wastes during the Manhattan Projectof World War II. External comparisons with the US male population weresupplemented by regional comparisons. For the total cohort, deficitswere observed for all causes of death (standardized mortality ratio (SMR)= 87) and most non-cancer causes. The observed number of cancer deathswas close to expected (SMR = 99). There was an excess of connective andsoft tissue cancer deaths, most notably in hourly employees hired priorto 1946. Among all hourly employees, there was an excess of respiratorycancer, which did not appear to be associated with length of employment.Mesothelioma was recorded as the cause of death for three decedents,two of whom were hourly employees who worked in production areas withhigh potential for asbestos exposure. The standardized mortality ratiofor cirrhosis of the liver was elevated among long-term hourly employeeshired prior to 1946. The roles of carbon tetrachloride exposure in the1940s and alcohol consumption are discussed as possible contributoryrisk factors for the cirrhosis findings. The data do not provide evidenceof radiation-induced cancers within this employee population.</TEXT></DOC>
