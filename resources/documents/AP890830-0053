It was the latest blow to the Moslem insurgents'government-in-exile, which has been troubled by bickering andfighting.   The leader, Gulbaddin Hekmatyar of the fundamentalistHezb-i-Islami rebel group, said he will no longer attend thegovernment's cabinet meetings until elections are held, hisspokesman, Abdul Qadeer Karyab, said in an interview.   The move fulfilled a threat Hekmatyar made earlier this monthwhen he criticized the interim government for not meeting asix-month deadline for elections and the drafting of an Islamicconstitution for Afghanistan.   The charismatic rebel leader has repeatedly been accused oftreachery by rival guerrilla fighters.   His group was accused of carrying out last month's massacre of 32rebels of Jamiat-i-Islami, an equally powerful but more liberalguerrilla group.   Washington, the major supporter of the rebels, condemned thekillings in Afghanistan's northern Takhar province.   Since then, the fighting between the two rebel groups hasescalated, and the latest reports claim hundreds may have died inrecent clashes.   Jamiat leader Burhanuddin Rabbani called for Hekmatyar'ssuspension from the government following the Takhar slayings.   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, president of the rebels' interimgovernment, branded Hekmatyar a ``killer'' and claimed he has usedU.S. military backing to kill other guerrillas and Afghans.Hekmatyar's group has been a major recipient of U.S. military aidchanneled through Pakistan.   United States policy gives full support to the fragilegovernment-in-exile.   Peter Tomsen, the U.S. special envoy to the guerrillas, wasmeeting Afghan rebels based in the southwestern Pakistani city ofQuetta today and could not be immediately reached for comment.   Tomsen is on his second tour of Pakistan, where the majority ofthe anti-Communist rebels are headquartered. Aside fromaccommodating the fractious guerrilla government, whose membershipis limited to seven major rebel parties, Pakistan shelters 3 millionAfghan war refugees.   For more than a decade the insurgents have been fighting totopple the Marxist government of President Najib. The guerrrillasalso receive military aid from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and other Arabstates.   In 1979, Moscow sent in troops to back its communist alliesagainst a growing insurgency and to replace one leader with another.But in February the last of more than 100,000 Red Army soldiers leftAfghanistan.   Elections were promised by the rebel leadership within six monthsof its government's establishment in February.   Syed Gailani, the leader of the moderate National Islamic Frontof Afghanistan, holds the Supreme Court portfolio, which puts him incharge of elections. But a spokesman for his group, Azim Nasser-Zia,said the government does not have the money to hold the elections.   ``Somehow nothing has been allocated for the Supreme Court tohave its own office, let alone conduct an election,'' the spokesmansaid.   ``It can't be done by just one man.''</TEXT></DOC>
