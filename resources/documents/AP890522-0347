The service, in a prepared statement, said only two gunmakershad taken advantage of the congressional order to enter 9mm guns inthe new competition _ Smith andamp; Wesson Corp. of Springfield, Mass.,and Sturm, Ruger andamp; Co. of Southport, Conn.   ``The performance of the Beretta USA M9 pistol was significantlybetter than either of the competing weapons,'' the Army said insummarizing the results. ``During the testing, both of the othercandidate weapons failed some of the mandatory requirements.''   Beretta's victory means the company is in line for an immediatecontract option order for almost 57,000 pistols worth $9.9 million.That order will bring to almost 378,000 the number of pistolsordered by the Army.   Over the next several years, however, new orders are expected toswell the orders to more than 500,000 total, according to the Army.   Assuming congressional leaders accept the test results, Monday'sannouncement would end a five-year battle over the Army's decisionto turn to a foreign company for the handgun that is replacing thevenerable Colt .45 pistol.   Testing of replacements began in 1984. Of the original eightcompetitors, four were eliminated _ including Smith andamp; Wesson _ andtwo others withdrew. The Army then selected Beretta for the work inApril 1985, touching off protests from Capitol Hill.   Beretta USA, which operates a manufacturing plant in Accokeek,Md., is a subsidiary of the Italian arms maker Armi Beretta SpA.   The Massachusetts delegation, in particular, went to bat forSmith andamp; Wesson and in 1987 the House Appropriations Committee toldthe Army it would have to stage a new competition before awardingadditional contracts.   The Army grudgingly complied, issuing a request for interestedbidders in May 1988. As the competition began, the prospects ofanother winner appeared to improve for a time because ofwell-publicized problems with cracking metal slides on the Berettapistol.   But Monday, the Army said ``the demonstrated performance'' ofthe Beretta pistol during the competition ``and the failure of thetwo other candidates to meet the minimum performance requirements''made its choice easy.   The service refused to spell out which standards the Smith andamp;Wesson and Sturm, Ruger pistols had failed to meet. But the gunswere being measured on everything from the design of the magazineand trigger guard to corrosion protection; accuracy; reliability;firing pin energy; safety mechanisms, and ability to withstandvarious climatic conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
