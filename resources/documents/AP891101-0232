Lujan, speaking to the Independent Petroleum Association ofAmerica, said the Department of the Interior is working with theEnergy Department on a national energy strategy that will include amix of oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear power, renewable energy andenergy conservation.   While developing a domestic energy policy, Lujan said, theUnited States and energy industry face the challenge of ``securinga healthy and safe environmental future for our children and futuregenerations of America.''   In a news conference afterward, Lujan said, ``You have to bemore environmentally sensitive if you're going to move the industryalong.''   As for his own agency, Lujan said, the Department of theInterior now has more of an ``environmental tilt'' than in pastadministrations.   Lujan said he doesn't believe oil imports will decrease any timesoon and are approaching 60 percent of the U.S. oil supply.   He also said that opposition to oil well drilling on the outercontinental shelf, particularly off the Florida and Californiacoasts, will preclude much future exploration and development there.   ``It's going to be very difficult for us to offer thoseresources.''   Lujan is chairing a five-agency task force expected to makerecommendations to President Bush in early 1990 on drilling on theouter continental shelf.</TEXT></DOC>
