Since the United States entered the foreign aid arena with theMarshall Plan for Europe after World War II, the program has grownmore complex, global realities have changed and America has lost itsposition as the world's most charitable nation, said the report tothe House Foreign Affairs Committee.   ``U.S. foreign assistance needs a new premise, a new frameworkand a new purpose to meet the challenges of today,'' said thereport, presented to committee members in a closed-door meeting.``It is time to start anew.''   The task force, led by Reps. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., and BenjaminGilman, R-N.Y., recommended repeal of the basic foreign aid lawpassed 28 years ago, which it said has grown cumbersome andinconsistent.   It called instead for a new ``International Economic CooperationAct of 1989'' which would more narrowly define the goals of U.S. aidto other countries and aim American help at encouraging broad-basedeconomic growth in Third World countries and alleviating povertywhile encouraging political freedom and environmental protection.   The recommendations would sharply curb the use of ``earmarks,''the instructions by Congress spelling out precisely which countriesand programs are to receive money, and how much. The practice hasgrown to the point where nearly all military and economic aid moneyis earmarked, and half of development funds, leaving littleflexibility to those who administer the programs.   Kathleen Mazzocco, a spokeswoman for the non-profit PopulationCrisis Committee, said her group's population control activitieswere typical of the kinds of programs that are politicallyvulnerable and could suffer if protective earmarks are eliminated.   ``There will be constant warfare and conflict, no collegialityamong the competing groups,'' she said. In addition to familyplanning efforts, agriculture and health programs are also likely tobe vulnerable to cuts, she said.   Hamilton had hinted at some of the new directions in an articlein the February issue of the Foreign Service Journal, in which hesaid ``our current program suffers from too great a concentration onthe Middle East, too much emphasis on military sales ... and toogreat an emphasis on immediate political objectives.''   In the current fiscal year, Israel and Egypt will recieve half ofthe total $15 billion U.S. aid budget, with another large slicegoing to other strategically important allies such as Pakistan,Turkey, the Philippines, El Salvador and Greece. Relatively littleis left for Africa and others among the world's poorest countries.   In inflation-adjusted dollars, this year's aid total is the sameas Americans spent in 1977, and represents an all-time low for theUnited States as a percentage of its gross national product. For thefirst time this year, Japan is surpassing the United States as theworld's largest donor country.   The report's authors hope it will be the framework forconstruction of this year's foreign aid legislation, but theyacknowledge their approach will be a hard sell. Foreign aid is amongthe least-popular government programs, and budget constraints meanit will be under an even greater than usual squeeze this time.   ``As the pie shrinks, members of Congress, interest groups,departments and agencies will each fight to protect their particularinterest,'' the report stated. ``In sum, the United States will haveto do more with available resources.''   Under the new system, aid programs would be evaluated by how wellthey achieve their goals, rather than focusing on heavy accountingand reporting requirements that have turned aid programs into abureaucratic nightmare, the task force said.   The act would establish a new Economic Cooperation Agency toadminister its programs as the successor to the Agency forInternational Development, which now handles that task.</TEXT></DOC>
