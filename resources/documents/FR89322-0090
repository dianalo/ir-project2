Thesechanges address certain NRC staff concerns raised in Generic Letter 88-17,Loss of Decay Heat Removal.Environmental Impacts of the Proposed ActionThe Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision toTS and concludes that the proposed changes will result in a significantdecrease in the probability of a loss of decay heat removal capabilityand result in a net safety benefit. Therefore, the proposed changes donot increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changes arebeing made in the types of any effluents that may be released offsite,and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulativeoccupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludesthat this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmentalimpact.The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forPrior Hearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 8, 1989 (54 FR 6222). No requestfor hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following thisnotice.With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed change tothe TS involves systems located within the restricted area as defined by10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents andhas no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludesthat there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associatedwith the proposed amendment.Alternatives to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would resultin reduced operational flexibility.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statement for the Callaway Plant dated January1982.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult otheragencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated January 6, 1989 and a supplement dated February 10, 1989,which are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public DocumentRoom, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC and at the Callaway County PublicLibrary, 710 Court Street, Fulton, Missouri 65251 and the John M.
