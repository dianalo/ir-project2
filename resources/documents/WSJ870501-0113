Congress is now starting to sense that independent prosecutors also infringe on its oversight function. Lawrence Walsh's criminal investigations are proving to be a big barrier to disclosing the truth.    With congressional testimony about to begin next week, this conflict is rapidly surfacing. &quot;There are too many important issues facing the country for the American people to wait while {Walsh's} investigation goes on ad nauseam,&quot; Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.), the vice chairman of the Senate panel investigating Iranamok, told the Washington Post. &quot;The train is leaving the station,&quot; he said. &quot;We're ready to roll and Judge Walsh has to understand that.&quot;    Mr. Walsh's first accomplishment only serves to underline the concern. He got Carl Channell to cop a plea on Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3). The criminal information Mr. Walsh filed charged that Mr. Channell &quot;caused to be filed with the IRS a 1985 Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax.&quot; The claim was that his National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty wasn't entitled to tax-free charity status because it raised funds for weapons for the contras. Can the Iranamok fuss be reduced to violating the tax code?    This is certainly not to say that possible abuse of tax-exempt status is not a legitimate issue. Indeed, we'd be interested in an IRS investigation of the organizations that collect funds to help the Sandinistas, the Marxist-Leninist government of Ethiopia and other such regimes that can hardly be termed charitable. Whether middlemen pocketed money intended for the contras is certainly a valid subject for Mr. Walsh to pursue, but we doubt that Ollie North and John Poindexter were out to enrich themselves. The larger point is that a violation of the tax code for charities is unquestionably a penny-ante violation in the wider context of Iranamok.    The tax-code case is especially maddening because Mr. Walsh's criminal investigations have dragged on for months so far, with no end in sight. In his recent report to Congress Mr. Walsh wrote that his &quot;primary responsibility&quot; is not &quot;to develop for the public a knowledge of what occurred.&quot; Instead, &quot;the process requires the identification of individuals and proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the participation of each. In some cases it is not sufficient merely to prove an act, it is also necessary to prove intent. The investigation of this complex series of transactions must be extensive.&quot; He has said it could be mid-1988 before any trials begin.    Sen. Rudman, a former New Hampshire attorney general, says the evidence he's seen indicates that the only significant crime that could posibly arise from Iranamok is some obstruction of justice claim arising from destroying documents. &quot;If they go with some grand, wild conspiracy case, you're going to have a hell of a time proving it.&quot;    So what we have is a criminal investigation that is unlikely to find any crimes the Justice Department couldn't handle as routine business, but that has prevented the president, Congress and the normal political process from exposing the facts to the public. Why?    Mostly because while the independent prosecutor is independent in name and perhaps in his person, his appointment is a political weapon in intent. The liberals lost the political debate on whether to fund the contras. Now they're delighted to have contra supporters dragged through the morass of the legal system. In what seemed a moment of political desperation, of course, the president gave the device his blessing. The beginning of any solution is for Ronald Reagan to look in the mirror and admit that this was a mistake. </TEXT></DOC>
