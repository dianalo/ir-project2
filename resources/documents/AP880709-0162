A Hong Kong government statement Friday said the British Embassyin Hanoi has received an invitation for government officials inthis British colony to visit Vietnam to discuss the issue of theboat people.   The statement said the Hong Kong authorities will respondpostively to the invitation but gave no other details.   It would be very useful to discuss the ``problem with theVietnamese authorities and seek their cooperation in stopping theouflow (of boat people) and in repatriating those who are notgeninue refugees,'' the statement added.   In a broadcast made available in Bangkok Friday, Hanoi radioquoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying that while Vietnamwas ``striving to stop illegal evacuees,'' a number were stillattempting to flee the country.   ``Vietnam with its humanitarian spirit and mutual understandingis ready to exchange bilateral views with countries andinternational organizations concerned to resolve this problem,''Hanoi radio quoted the spokesman as saying.   There are more than 16,000 Vietnamese boat people in Hong Kong.   In a new policy announced last month, the Hong Kong governmentregards all arriving Vietnamese refugees as illegal immigrantsunless they can prove they are fleeing Vietnam because of politicalor religious persecution.   Those found to be illegal immigrants are housed in detentioncenters and face repatriation to Vietnam.</TEXT></DOC>
