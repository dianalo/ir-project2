Mr. Trump said in an interview that he met with representatives of the Chicago-based operator of casinos and hotels about two weeks ago to discuss a possible buyout of his stake.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Bally shares closed at $20.25, off 25 cents.    While Mr. Trump declined to elaborate on his discussions, Wall Street sources said that Bally first proposed to buy the developer's stake in an all-cash offer of $28.50 a share. They said Mr. Trump was prepared to accept that offer, which would have brought him a $32 million profit.    But then, the sources said, Bally went back to Mr. Trump and asked him to accept a combination of cash and preferred shares that the company valued at $28.50 a share. They said Mr. Trump rejected Bally's renewed offer to buy back his shares at a premium, a strategy Wall Street calls &quot;greenmail.&quot;    A Bally spokesman declined comment on whether the company offered to buy Mr. Trump's stake.    As previously reported, Mr. Trump disclosed his Bally stake in late November and said he might boost that holding to more than 25% of the company's 33.5 million shares outstanding.    Earlier this month, in a move to thwart a possible hostile takeover, Bally said it was exploring a possible restructuring, and adopting a so-called poison pill preferred-stock rights distribution plan. The company also filed suit in federal court in Camden, N.J., seeking to force Mr. Trump to sell his Bally shares.    Several companies have recently offered premium payments to big holders who represented a takeover threat or a nuisance. Last month, Gillette Co. bought back 9.2 million of its shares at a premium from Ronald Perelman's Revlon Group Inc., and Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co. repurchased Sir James Goldsmith's stake in the company at an above-market price.    Separately, Wall Street sources familiar with Bally said the company is understood to have held talks earlier this year with Bethesda, Md.-based Marriott Corp. regarding the possible sale of Bally's Six Flags amusement parks and its tennis and health clubs.    However, the sources said the discussions have apparently broken down in recent weeks as Mr. Trump has emerged as a possible Bally suitor. &quot;Marriott is sitting back and waiting to see who they'll be dealing with,&quot; one Wall Street investment banker said.    A Bally spokesman said the company hasn't talked with Marriott about selling its amusement parks and tennis and health clubs. &quot;Currently, we're not talking to anybody about the theme parks,&quot; he added. Marriott officials couldn't be reached for comment. Bally acquired a theme park in Gurnee, Ill., from Marriott in 1984.    It still isn't clear whether Mr. Trump intends to make a bid for Bally. The developer has said only that he is holding his stake &quot;for investment purposes.&quot;    Meanwhile, Mr. Trump filed a new application with the Nevada Gaming Commission last week requesting a finding that he is suitable to be a major Bally shareholder. He had filed a similar application in October in connection with his 4.9% stake in Holiday Corp. As previously reported, Mr. Trump sold the Holiday stake last month, reaping a profit of $35 million.    The state's gambling commission is required to investigate any holder of more than 10% of a business that operates casinos in Nevada. Some individuals familiar with the commission said Mr. Trump may have a more difficult time gaining approval in Nevada than he did in New Jersey, where he owns two casino-hotel properties.    Bally owns two of the largest casino-hotels in Nevada, and also is the largest supplier of slot machines used in other casinos in the state. </TEXT></DOC>
