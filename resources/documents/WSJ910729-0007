Since late April,the central bank has kept its policy on hold, convinced thatshort-term interest rates were low enough to ensure amoderately healthy recovery. But now, some Fed officials arebeginning to think rates may need to go lower still.   The reason: money. For three months, growth in the keymoney-supply measure -- known as M2 -- has limped along at anannual rate below 3%, stubbornly defying Fed staffpredictions of a bounce-back. The latest figures, releasedThursday, show no improvement. &quot;I keep waiting and waiting,&quot;says a Fed policy maker. &quot;It makes me increasingly nervous.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   To be sure, the Fed has never slavishly tied its policiesto changes in the weekly money numbers, which are subject toerratic swings and major revisions. &quot;If you look at the moneysupply in the short run, it's all over the place,&quot; saysBoston Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Syron.                                                                                                          But money has assumed a more exalted place in the Fed'shagiocracy in recent months. Cleveland Fed President LeeHoskins, the most outspoken anti-inflation hawk, is awell-known devotee of the money numbers. Vice Chairman DavidMullins, who has frequently led the argument for easiercredit, bases much of his analysis on money. Fed ChairmanAlan Greenspan himself pays close attention to the moneynumbers.                                                                                                          Current circumstances make Fed officials more sensitivethan usual to the money numbers. Normally, money growthincreases during economic recoveries, and Fed officials haveexpected money to be growing at or above the midpoint of itscurrent target range for annual growth in M2, which is 2.5%to 6.5%. That money growth has stayed so anemic raises fearsabout the recovery's durability.   Moreover, the Fed has been criticized by economists whosay even the 4.5% to 5% money growth it seeks is too slow.Nobellaureate Paul Samuelson told Congress recently that theFed should ease to promote a recovery. And on Friday, MichaelBoskin, the president's economic adviser, said that unlessmoney growth &quot;turns around very, very soon,&quot; the Fed should&quot;move seriously to get the money supply up.&quot;   With such prominent critics arguing that the currenttarget is too low, the last thing Fed officials want to do isfall below it.                                                                                                          Why does money matter? Over time, economists believe, therate of growth in money determines the growth of the economyplus the rate of inflation. Fed officials hope slow moneygrowth presages lower inflation, but if it doesn't, astagnant economy could result.                                                                                                          Fed officials can't directly control money growth; itdepends partly on the willingness of people to borrow moneyand of banks to lend it. Fed Chairman Greenspan believes thewidely discussed &quot;credit crunch&quot; is an important reason whymoney growth remains slow. But by lowering short-terminterest rates, the Fed can spark more borrowing and thusspeed up money growth. The danger is that too much moneygrowth might reignite inflation, and Fed officials aredetermined to bring inflation down from its current plateauof about 4%.   Fed policy makers are preparing for a thorough debate ofthis issue when they meet here Aug. 20. If money growthhasn't picked up by then, there are certain to be calls for acut in interest rates. But there will be resistance, too,especially if the economy seems to be growing steadily. &quot;Aslong as the economy's on track -- and there's no compellingreason to say it's derailed now -- you just have to considerwhat is happening with regard to M2 as an anomaly,&quot; says SanFrancisco Fed President Robert Parry.   But economic indicators over the next few weeks mayprovide an ambiguous picture of the economy. Recent reportsshowing a drop in June orders for big-ticket durable goods,and declines in retail sales and auto sales all raisequestions about the strength of the recovery. The Fed insiststhe recovery is still on track, but a few more bad numberscould shake that confidence.                                                                                                          Congress also has a rare opportunity to nudge the Fedtoward easier credit at the August meeting by confirming thenomination of White House economist Lawrence Lindsey for thevacant seat on the Board of Governors. Mr. Lindsey is knownto share the view that current sluggish money growth isn'tsufficient to finance a healthy recovery.                                                                                                          Ironically, Mr. Lindsey's nomination has been held up by agroup of Democratic senators whose statements seem to favoran easier monetary policy, but who apparently are disturbedby Mr. Lindsey's passionate support of Ronald Reagan's 1981supply-side tax cuts. The senators miss the point: At theFed, Mr. Lindsey will have no say in tax policy but couldhave much to say about the future course of interest rates.</TEXT></DOC>
