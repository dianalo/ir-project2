Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler estimated the Cuban presence thereat between 2,500 and 3,500 and said their withdrawal would be``significant'' and ``positive.''   Cuba dispatched more than 12,000 forces to Ethiopia in 1977 tohelp the Marxist government put down a cross-border incursion fromSomalia. The dispute centered on conflicting claims to the Ogadenregion of Ethiopia.   The Cuban action soured what had been a promising start toward amore normal relationship between the United States and Cuba.   The two countries opened diplomatic missions in each other'scapital in September 1977 but, with the dispatch of the troops toEthiopia, progress toward improved relations was halted.   Ms. Tutwiler refused to speculate on what a complete withdrawalof Cuban forces from Ethiopia would mean for U.S.-Cuban relations.Late last year, Cuba agreed to withdraw its forces from Angola overa 27-month time frame and has pulled out a significant number oftroops since then.   On a related subject, Ms. Tutwiler said the administration wasencouraged by the start of peace talks in Atlanta betweenrepresentatives of the Ethiopian government and a rebel group whichhas been seeking independence for the northern territory of Eritrea.   The talks were arranged by former President Carter.   ``We hope that the discussions that have begin in Atlanta willlead to a just and durable settlement on terms acceptable to bothsides,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.</TEXT></DOC>
