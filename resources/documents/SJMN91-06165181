They changed a budget form toclose the hole, but stopped short of vigorously trying to recover themisappropriated money.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HUD WHISTLEBLOWER MIGHT AS WELL HAVE A KAZOO  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  See also related story on page 1A of this section.  </MEMO><TEXT>     But instead of rewarding Mackey with the hefty bonus promised to employeeswho save money, they offered him $1,000 for a suggestion judged to be of&quot;moderate benefit.&quot;;    &quot;How many rundown apartments could have been fixed upwith that money?&quot; Mackey asks of the estimated $50 million. &quot;When I got thatresponse back, I was just amazed.&quot;;    The glitch involved one of the fewcontrols HUD has to ensure that a $2.5 billion-a-year fund for fixing updeteriorating public housing is spent mostly on paint and plywood rather thanon overhead.;    HUD's regulations limit planning and &quot;managementimprovements&quot; to 10 percent of actual construction costs. But Mackey, ahousing management specialist, discovered in May 1990 that the budget formsallowed those items to total 10 percent of total costs, which includeadministration expenses.;    The difference translated into big money -- $10.9million in 1989 just in the four field offices HUD checked after Mackey'ssuggestion. A check of 1988 and 1989 spending in the San Francisco fieldoffice found $6.1 million in &quot;excess&quot; management improvement and planningcosts, $3.7 million of which went to the San Francisco Housing Authority and$1.8 million of which went to the Oakland authority.;    If HUD spendingduring the 10-year remodeling program was checked nationwide, Mackey says he'scertain excess management improvement costs would total at least $50 million.&quot;And that's a conservative figure,&quot; he said.;    Frank Coveleski, head of theinspector general's office of audit for HUD assisted housing programs, saidthe total amount misspent nationwide could be known only by reviewing recordsof 3,400 housing authorities. HUD decided that would be an unnecessaryexpense, he said, because corrective action already had been taken.;    &quot;Thebottom line was HUD couldn't determine the tangible benefits&quot; of the glitchMackey had detected, Coveleski said.;    That bottom line left Mackeythousands of dollars poorer.;    Under HUD's Ideas program, employees whooffer money-saving suggestions receive 0.5 percent of the savings up to amaximum $35,000.;    By Mackey's calculations, the $6.1 million in confirmedmisappropriations in San Francisco alone qualified him for the maximumreward.;    Janice Rattley, the HUD official who oversees the housingrehabilitation program, didn't see it that way. In a marvel of bureaucraticreasoning, she ended an analysis of his suggestion with a conclusion:;   &quot;Finally, it should be pointed out that any funding of management improvementand planning costs in excess of the 10% limitation does not reflect fraud,waste or mismanagement. If not approved for eligible management improvementand planning costs, the excess funds would have been approved for eligiblephysical improvement or hard costs. Therefore, the excess funds are not excessin the meaning in which we normally think of excess funds.&quot;;    As a result ofRattley's conclusion, Mackey's suggestion was given the lowest rewardablerating. Last month he received a chirpy letter from Lea Hamilton, HUD deputydirector of personnel, congratulating him and telling him he would soonreceive $1,000, less taxes.;    &quot;I encourage you to continue to look for waysto improve the operation and services of the federal government and to submityour suggestions to the Ideas Program,&quot; she wrote.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MICHAEL DORGAN, Mercury News San Francisco Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  San Francisco  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910613  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  24A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  604  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday June 13, 199100165181,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
