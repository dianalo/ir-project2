Avtex Fibers Front Royal Inc., a closely held Front Royal, Va., fiber manufacturer, is the nation's only producer of carbonized rayon yarn used to insulate solid-rocket nozzles. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said it has enough of the material on hand for about a dozen space-shuttle launches. The Air Force said it uses the material in the MX and Midgetman missiles, and in a host of tactical missiles, but it wasn't sure how much it has on hand.    &quot;The potential effects of the closing are very serious,&quot; said Royce Mitchell, a NASA solid-rocket motor manager. &quot;We'll have to develop an alternate source or get this guy back on his feet again.&quot;    John Gregg, Avtex's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement that the company was closing because it couldn't compete with lower-cost foreign producers. The cost of Avtex's U.S. and Canadian-produced wood pulp, used to make rayon, has increased substantially, he said, while the company's two main rayon competitors have switched to cheaper South African wood pulp. &quot;Avtex has been squeezed out of the rayon market,&quot; he said.    But Avtex, which employed 1,300 people, also has been beset by a host of environmental and workplace-safety complaints. Mr. Gregg said Avtex had spent &quot;millions of dollars&quot; to improve the Front Royal plant.    Avtex's carbonized rayon is the raw material used in solid-fuel rocket-motor insulation. The Avtex material is processed and refined by three different companies before it is sold to such rocket makers as Morton Thiokol Inc., which cut and shape the material for rocket insulation.    Mr. Mitchell said Avtex's industrial customers plan to meet in Salt Lake City today to discuss what steps they could take to prop up Avtex or find an alternate supplier. NASA and the Pentagon might get involved, he said, by guaranteeing purchases or making loans to Avtex.    Earlier this year, the federal government guaranteed it would purchase a large amount of ammonium perchlorate, a crucial rocket-fuel ingredient, from the nation's two manufacturers of the chemical. The move was designed to encourage them to expand capacity after one of the producers, American Pacific Corp., saw its Henderson, Nev., plant destroyed in a series of explosions.    Mr. Mitchell said it would be difficult and expensive for another company to win Air Force and NASA approval to produce carbonized rayon. The company would have to duplicate Avtex's process and pass through a series of stringent tests, including test-rocket firings, before the government would approve the new supplier. </TEXT></DOC>
