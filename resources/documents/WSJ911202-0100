And in an unusual move, GM asked its nearly 300,000 U.S.hourly workers to forgo the $600 Christmas bonuses called forin their national contract. But United Auto Workers unionleaders rebuffed the request, and hourly workers will get$180 million worth of payments as scheduled.</LP><TEXT>   GM's middle-management bonuses are separate from bonusesfor the company's 4,500 or so executive employees. Theirannual payments can be tens of thousands of dollars worth ofGM stock, and can total one-third or more of their totalcompensation. However, executive bonuses are virtuallycertain not to be awarded for the second straight year,especially in GM's loss-plagued North American autooperations.   Witholding Christmas bonuses from middle managers willsave GM just $60 million. But the message GM Chairman RobertC. Stempel and his senior managers sent by cutting thepayment -- and by taking the extraordinary step of asking theUAW to give back a contracted benefit -- may be moreimportant than the money saved.   The No. 1 auto maker is expected to lose nearly $3 billionoverall this year, with exceptionally heavy losses in NorthAmerican auto operations offsetting profits overseas and indiversified businesses. With the U.S. economy sputtering, GMexecutives see little hope -- short of drastic cost-cutting-- for quickly reversing two straight years of losses.   Earlier this year, GM slashed its common stock dividendand announced a series of cost- and job-cutting moves. GMalso has raised cash through both borrowing and preferredstock sales, and recently signaled plans to issue another$750 million in preference stock. But the continuingoperating deficits threaten GM's ability to invest in badlyneeded new vehicles, engines and transmissions. Already, thecompany has had to delay some new vehicles, including areplacement for its current line of compact trucks.   In light of the financial pressures, some analysts say GMshould take a much tougher crisis-management approach to cutexpenses.   Although cutting the Christmas bonus is a small step, it'sone calculated to grab the attention of every GM salariedworker. That's because it affects lower- and middle-levelemployees not affected by the company's elimination ofexecutive stock bonuses.   &quot;We're cutting costs where we can,&quot; a GM spokesman saidthis weekend. &quot;It (the $60 million) may not seem like a lot.But it's a sum we can't afford to pay.&quot;   And while GM's U.S. hourly workers will get their $600Christmas payments, they won't receive additionalprofit-sharing payments this year.   The $600 per-worker cash bonus was negotiated as part ofGM's 1990 contract with the UAW. Salaried workers got thecash bonus last year because GM's practice is to givewhite-collar employees the same benefits won by the UAW. GMtold salaried workers they wouldn't get the bonus in lettersdistributed Tuesday, the spokesman said.   GM's rivals, Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co., also facebig losses this year and are looking to slash costs. But aChrysler spokesman said the company hasn't decided yetwhether to cut the Christmas bonus for salaried workers. Fordsaid its white-collar workers didn't get Christmas bonuseslast year and won't receive them this year.   Like GM, Chrysler and Ford so far have succeeded incovering their operating losses with capital raised from bothborrowing and securities sales. Ford recently sold $2.3billion worth of preferred stock -- triple the amountoriginally planned. And Chrysler raised about $338 million ina common stock offering.</TEXT></DOC>
