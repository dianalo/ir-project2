She cited afew titles: ``The Bridge Beyond.'' ``Yonkers In Review.'' ``LiveInterviews on Christmas.'' ``The Final Judgement.''   ``Oops,'' she says, ``that last one has judgment spelled wrong,which isn't going to help, but then videos rarely do. We don't havethe time or the facilities to give them the consideration theeffort deserves.''   MIT, where 6,600 apply for 1,050 openings, also has beeninundated with videotapes. ``These can backfire by being a sort ofoverkill,'' laments Michael Behnke, director of admissions. ``Butwe try not to hold it against them. Some are poorly done. The mostcommon take the form of `A Tour of My Life.'   ``You get this poor kid opening a door and saying, `Hi! This ismy room.   ``Come on in and meet my computer. Here's my bookcase.' Then hewanders around and introduces Mom and Dad and the dog. It's allkind of silly and a little pathetic.''   Georgetown, sifting through 11,000 folders to assemble a classof 1,320, tries to discourage videotapes. ``They're bulky to storeand difficult for the committees of our five separate schools toview and pass around,'' says Letitia Peterson, associate dean ofadmissions.   Vassar, where the fall class of 600 was chosen from a pool of4,350, doesn't accept videocassettes at all.   Before the video craze, Conrad says, ``Tulane used to get somevery elaborate portfolios and collages. Students would displayclippings of every bake sale they ever participated in and longlists of awards and blue ribbons. The ones I always chuckle at areperfect attendance certificates.''   This year a young lady sent Georgetown a hollowed-out goose eggafter an Ivy League recruiter at her high school put thumb andindex finger together and intoned ``goose egg'' when asked aboutthe impression made by a well-rounded student. ``I'm the ultimategoose egg,'' she confessed, but promised to focus her variedinterests in one direction if accepted.   In rare cases, applicants fraudulently have claimed to behandicapped or a member of a minority or from some exoticbackground to gain preference.   A Tulane aspirant tried ``tracing his family tree back toCherokee Indians.''   Harvard's Fitzsimmons recalls a foreign student who applied forsix or seven years, always with a different ploy. ``One year he wasvery poor, then he claimed to be the son of the prime minister andnext the son of an alumnus. He filled out his own teacher andcounselor reports, with very little effort to disguise his handwriting, and one year used green ink for everything.''   Lately a number of top colleges have been questioning the valueof interviewing each applicant.   ``Our next faculty meeting on admissions will be looking atexactly that question,'' says Vassar's Montoya. ``Not all studentsshine in an interview. The feeling is that a half-hour does nottell us as much as the four-year academic record or recommendationsfrom those who have seen the student in action.''   Tulane has gotten away from the formal interview in favor ofgroup information sessions conducted by alumni across the country.   But a personal appearance is paramount for admission to what isundoubtedly the nation's choosiest freshman class: the dramadivision at the New York's Juilliard School. Each year more than800, sometimes as many as 1,000, audition for only 25 openings.   Competition is spurred by the success of such recent graduatesas William Hurt, Elizabeth McGovern, Christopher Reeve, StephanieZimbalist, Kevin Kline, who won an Oscar this year, and also by thestatistic that 80 percent of the alumni are actively working infilm or theater.   At auditions held in February in Chicago, New Orleans, SanFrancisco and at the Lincoln Center campus, each applicant presentsa two-minute classical and a two-minute contemporary monologue to apanel of full-time professionals: actors, directors, voice coachesand movement specialists.   ``Shakespeare and the Greek dramatists are popular in theclassics,'' says auditions coordinator Barbara DeGast, ``andanything from Chekhov and Shaw to Sam Shepherd is fair game for thecontemporary part. Many are self-written, and some fit singing anddancing into the combined four minutes. We don't accept videos,except in the rare case of a Swiss student who couldn't get to anaudition.''   All of the admissions officers showed compassion, tolerance anda gentle sense of humor about the youthful dreams rising from theirin-baskets, gimmicks and all.   Sometimes a gimmick is ingenious enough to qualify as``supplemental material'' or at least, as David concedes, ``itbrings a little amusement into a long day.''   The robotic finger beckoning MIT's Behnke ``demonstrated skillin carving and figuring out the dynamics _ it actually moved at thejoints without executing an obscene gesture.''   Tulane was intrigued by ``a beautifully executed treasure mapthat showed real knowledge of cartography and l7th century piracy''and with an engineering applicant who ``turned a very complex mathequation into to a love story, an amusing soap opera about therelationshiained rain forest, an ocean, freshand saltwater marshes, rolling plains and desert, a kind ofearthbound space colony.   Next year, eight men and women will begin a two-year stay inthis tiny, self-sufficient paradise to test just how the worldoutside works, and how mankind can avoid destroying its fragile andinterlocking ecosystems.   Kathleen Dyhr, a 39-year-old spokeswoman for the project calledBiosphere II, is one of the 14 candidates. She says the choseneight probably will be single, probably four women and four men.Marrieds can apply, but unless both are especially qualified, onelikely would be denied.   The candidates already know each other well in their everydaylives on the outside, so it is doubtful that romance will bloomunder glass. But if it does, it is presumed it will be discreet.   There is overall a duty to mission, and the candidates will bechosen for their dedication. There won't be any psychologicaltesting, since there is stress enough in this geonaut business asit is.   Although the interior design is still tentative, eachbiospherian will have an individual apartment with a ground floorand a mezzanine, small but private. Unlike the rest of thebiosphere, the walls of the habitat will not be transparent. Eachapartment will have its own kitchenette, although, because of aneed for food control, the main meal of the day will be centrallyprepared and served.   There will be a recreation room, a small gym, laboratories,offices and a library.   If Dyhr is selected, she'll have to give up cigarettes. No openflame in the biosphere. It burns up oxygen.   To test the basic living quarters, Abigail Alling, a 29-year-oldbiosphere worker, spent five days in March living in a test modulewhere she harvested her own food from her own garden, cooked herown meals and monitored her tiny environment, a 15,000-cubic-footchamber smaller than a moving van. She said of her experience, ``Itis truly a paradise inside. It's like a tropical garden.''   But five days is not two years. No one knows what stresses willcrop up.   The project is organized on the same basis as a scientificexpedition, with which most applicants have had experience. Therewill be a group leader, but there will also be family and outsideguidance available by telephone. In short, they will not be alone,stranded in space. If professional conflicts cannot be adjudicatedon the inside, they will be from the outside.   ``You're going to have problems wherever you have people,''Dyher says. ``But if you have eight individuals who are reallyinterested in what they are doing, you're going to have the bestchance of everything working together.''   Their days will be full. Besides running scientific experiments,the volunteers will be completely on their own, raising their ownfood on a 24,000-square-foot terraced farm, where they will reapbananas, papayas, tomatoes, cucumbers, wheat, and corn. There willbe pygmy pigs, chickens and milk from pygmy goats, enough toprovide each of them a balanced daily diet of about 2,500 calories.   There will be coffee bushes, enough for a couple of cups eachper week and grapevines, enough for a ceremonial glass of wine nowand again. Besides, there's always papaya or banana brandy.   When the last of the eight steps through the door _ sometimebefore September 1990 _ it will be closed for more than 700 days.Not so much as a newspaper or quart of milk will cross thethreshhold of this solar-powered earthship. News, movies,television will be piped in.   But Biosphere II, which covers 2{ acres and has 5 million cubicfeet of space, has a larger purpose than mere survival. It mayprovide the pattern for future space stations and become amarketable biosphere for other purposes, from the protection ofendangered species to the education of ecologists, a laboratory forhow the planet works.   It is being financed by Edward P. Bass, a wealthy Texas oil manand supporter of several environmental organizations such as TheWorld Wildlife Fund. Bass is sinking $30 million into the project,which is located on his 2,500-acre Sun Space Ranch in this cornerof Ariizona where the Santa Catalina Mountains roll down to theSonorran desert and Tucson to the southwest.   It is no easy task, this latter-day genesis. Just take theinsects which they grow and breed in an insectarium on the ranchgrounds. Some 250 species will be chosen to do the myriadminichores in Biosphere II. They have been collected from all overBiosphere I, which is planet Earth.   Bugs will pollinate the plants, break down dead plant materialso fungi and other processors can recycle it, and provide food forthe birds and fishes. A few butterflies are being added foraesthetics.   Cockroaches, termites, earthworms and millipedes are welcomebecause they enhance the soil. Houseflies, however, need not apply.They are useless.   ``When the life sciences people mentioned termites, theengineers started jumping up and down,'' says Project DirectorMargaret Augustine. They were afraid the termites, which have beenknown to digest concrete, would eat their way through the sealantthat keeps the glass dome airtight.   That led to tests with the termites the scientists decided touse, and the creation of ``a worst case termite scenario.'' Theycreated a little termite sandwich in the center of which was somefavorite termite food. The sealant was deemed safe when thetermites would not chew through to the inner prize.   So much for termites. What about lights in the human quarters atnight? They screened off the human quarters against the bugs.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
