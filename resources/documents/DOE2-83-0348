The theory developed is an extension of earlier work performedby Mark Crain and Robert McCormick. Its theoretical basis resides inpublic choice and regulatory economics. In the tradition of public-choicethought, the commissioners' utility function is modeled to determinethe political as well as economic-efficiency variables influencing thecommissioners' decision. The rate-making process is modeled as a systemfor four distinct interest groups - commission members, commission staff,producers (regulated utilities), and consumers (ratepayers) - competingfor the wealth transfers emanating from the rate-making process. An ordinaryleast-squares regression analysis was performed for each of the 4 interestgroups. Statistically significant political and economic influences areexerted by the consumer group in determining the budget appropriatedto the regulatory commission. The producer group and the commission itselfare also influential in determining commission budget. Likewise, thecommission staff's influence on the commission decision is assumed tobe a function of the size of the commission staff.</TEXT></DOC>
