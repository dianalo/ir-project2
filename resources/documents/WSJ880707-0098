Separately, the West German cabinet is expected today to approve a 524 million-mark ($287.6 million) provision for the government's 1989 budget to cover losses at Airbus stemming from the low value of the dollar. While the four-nation aircraft consortium's costs are in European currencies, its revenue is in dollars.    The expected 1989 budget provision is more than double the 1988 figure, a major setback to the Reagan administration's attempts to negotiate a gradual phaseout of Airbus subsidies. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has been pressing the U.S. case since last March, but the talks with Airbus's four European partners are in a &quot;stalemate,&quot; Mr. Yeutter's aides said.    German government sources said Bonn is prepared to offer a guarantee of four billion marks against future Airbus currency losses on existing programs, as well as a separate guarantee against currency losses related to the A-330/A-340 program, if Daimler-Benz takes control of MBB. Formal talks aren't expected to begin for several weeks.    Government sources said officials now value the 30% stake in the aerospace group at about 800 million marks. However, they cautioned that the actual purchase price will depend on many variables, including the guarantees against future losses.    Bonn also apparently expects a Daimler-Benz-owned MBB to retain at least a 75% interest in loss-ridden Deutsche Airbus through a new holding company. MBB now owns 100% of Deutsche Airbus, the German portion of Airbus.    Daimler-Benz's chairman, Edzard Reuter, repeatedly has said that coverage against the Airbus risk is an &quot;essential condition&quot; if the company is to assume control of MBB. As reported, Mr. Reuter said the government had cleared most major obstacles to the participation of Daimler-Benz in MBB. But he said a decision on taking a stake in MBB wouldn't be made until Daimler-Benz was satisfied that it wouldn't be engaging in an &quot;incalculable adventure.&quot;    Daimler-Benz's shares surged 40 marks ($21.96) apiece on the Frankfurt stock exchange yesterday, to 703 marks. &quot;The perception is that, if Airbus risks are covered, an acquisition of MBB could have positive effects on the Daimler-Benz group in the long term,&quot; said one broker. </TEXT></DOC>
