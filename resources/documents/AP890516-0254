Chairman Robert Schmiege told about 300 shareholders at CNW'sannual meeting that management was working with financial expertsand an unidentified outside party to devise an offer that wouldderail the $44-a-share offer by Japonica Partners, which alreadyowns about 8.8 percent of CNW's stock.   ``We are reasonably optimistic we will succeed in this effort,''Schmiege said.   CNW is parent of the 6,000-mile Chicago andamp; North WesternTransportation Co., an important freight hauler in the Midwest andone of the largest freight-hauling railroads in the country. Italso provides passenger service in the Chicago area.   Japonica's offer was timed to coincide with the annualshareholders meeting and an effort to oust CNW's board through aproxy contest.   The tender offer is to purchase 13.9 million shares of commonstock at $44 a share in cash, or about $612 million, and 2.7million shares of convertible preferred stock at $34.11 a share incash, or about $92 million.   Japonica said in a statement issued today that it wants to runCNW's freight operations, but would sell the railroad holdingcompany's commuter line.   The offer expires at midnight EDT on June 13, unless extended byJaponica.   ``We sincerely believe that our offer and the experience andcompetitive culture Japonica Partners will bring to CNW is in thebest interests of the company, its employees, customers and thecommunities it serves,'' said the Japonica statement.   CNW's common stock closed Monday at $43.75 a share, down 87{cents, in composite trading.   Japonica said it intends to acquire all of CNW's stock. Thetender offer would potentially give it 90 percent of CNW's commonshares and preferred shares.   Meanwhile, a Delaware federal court was due to rule today on amotion by Japonica to delay today's scheduled shareholder vote onthe grounds that CNW had violated proxy solicitation rules. CNWofficials have denied the allegation.   Japonica, a 1-year-old partnership headed by former GoldmanSachs andamp; Co. vice presidents Paul Kazarian and Michael Lederman,began courting CNW in March with an unsolicited offer to negotiatea buyout.   CNW Chairman Robert Schmiege termed the offer ``nonsense.''   Since then, Japonica has repeatedly declared its intention toacquire CNW.   CNW's board of directors has formed a special committee tosolicit other offers. The company has said it is negotiating withat least one potential bidder.   In a statement issued today, CNW said the auction process iscontinuing despite Japonica's latest move.   ``(O)ther potential bidders have already signed confidentialityagreements and are in discussions with representatives of thespecial committee'' set up to consider alternatives to to maximizestockholder value, the statement said.   CNW urged stockholders ``to focus on the fact that it remainsimportant that the special committee of CNW's board of directorsremain in control of the acution process.   The committee would ``meet promptly'' to consider Japonica'soffer, the CNW statement said.   In Japonica's statement, the partnership said ``We intend tomanage all the freight operations of CNW ... while workingcooperatively with the employee unions to maintain and improveoperations and service for CNW's customers. The assets we areconsidering selling are only those not essential to CNW's freightbusiness, such as certain real estate, excess equipment, and thecommuter line.''   Congress and the Interstate Commerce Commission have beenwatching Japonica's actions with an eye toward stepping in toprevent any disruption of rail service.</TEXT></DOC>
