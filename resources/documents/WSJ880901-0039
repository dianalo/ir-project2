White and Kathryn Graven </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> JAPAN </CO><IN> STK HRD INS </IN><TEXT>   Japanese life insurance companies are curbing their rapid buying and selling of U.S. shares just to earn stock dividends, a practice with which Wall Street has developed a love-hate relationship.    Curtailing the so-called dividend-capture trading isn't expected to cause a major financial sacrifice on the part of the Japanese insurers that have used it increasingly in the past two years. Nor will it deal a severe blow to the U.S. and Japanese brokerage firms handling the business, because of its relatively low profit levels.    Nonetheless, Wall Street has embraced any business as better than none. The New York Stock Exchange volume, depressed since the Oct. 19 crash, will sink further with the curtailment of the dividend-related activity. On some days, such trading generates 25% of the NYSE's total volume and, according to Salomon Brothers Inc., it accounted for 11% of the exchange's volume in this year's first half.    Several Japanese insurers say they started reducing their dividend-capture trading in mid-August, as part of a typical slowdown in activity before the current accounting period ends on Sept. 30. An official of one securities firm active in arranging dividend captures also said nine Japanese insurers held a meeting last week at which they decided to voluntarily curb their use of the trading technique.    But analysts say the current scaling back doesn't mean Japanese insurance companies are going to completely abandon the practice. &quot;I think many will start to trade again in October,&quot; predicts Yoshinara Morimoto, general manager of Nomura Securities Co.'s international stock department. (The next accounting period begins Oct. 1.)    Critics of the dividend-capture strategy, which Japanese insurers use because of regulations requiring certain policy holders be paid interest from dividends rather than capital gains, say the activity artificially inflates volume while distorting traditional investment functions of the stock market. &quot;It's not the kind of trading on which you want to build your business if you're the NYSE,&quot; says the chief investment officer of a large pension fund.    Such criticism, while widespread, hasn't yet snowballed on either Wall Street or in Washington into action to try to damp the practice. Neither the NYSE nor the Securities and Exchange Commission has taken a stand on the dividend-capture activity.    Even so, some Japanese insurers said they wanted to avoid inflaming the issue in the U.S. &quot;It has become a topic of discussion in the U.S. So we want to do something about it before it becomes a real problem,&quot; said an official at Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co.    At this point, some Japanese insurers may have little to lose by agreeing to curtail dividend-capture activity. Many insurers say they already have enough dividend income to pay interest to holders of their whole life policies. (In Japan, insurers have plenty of income from capital gains but reap skimpy dividends.) &quot;We just don't need to do it right now,&quot; said one official at a major life insurance company.    Officials at insurance companies deny that they were directed to curb the practice by Japan's Ministry of Finance. &quot;Everyone made their own decision,&quot; insists the official at Meiji Life who asked not to be identified. The Ministry of Finance declined to comment, but a source close to the ministry said he didn't think any directives had been issued.    Still, other market participants in Tokyo suggested that exchange-rate considerations have prompted Japanese authorities to keep a closer watch on dividend-capture activity. Because insurance companies like to move large amounts of money when they do a dividend-capture play, their buying can upset the yen-dollar rate. To cover themselves, insurers often take out huge hedge positions. Recently, the Bank of Japan has been trying to keep exchange rates stable at a higher yen level, so such buying by insurers can undermine government efforts.    In the U.S., securities firms say the curbing of dividend-capture trading has been evident in recent days and appears likely to continue for at least a while. &quot;The business has slowed down, but to what extend we don't know yet,&quot; said Stanford Brainerd, senior executive vice president of Yamaichi Securities Co.'s U.S. unit. &quot;It looks like the major players will be holding back for a while,&quot; an official of another major Japanese securities firm said of the Japanese insurers who had been using dividend-capture strategies.    Another trader said business from Japanese insurers at his firm was &quot;virtually eliminated,&quot; but Mr. Brainerd and officials at other firms said that despite the falloff, they still had some dividend-capture activity scheduled, and there have been several such trades in the past week.    Ending the Japanese requirement that policy holders be paid from dividends would eliminate the impetus for most of the dividend-capture activity (a small fraction stems from other strategies), and many observers are betting on a regulation change next year.    Meanwhile, even a slowdown in the dividend-related trading is being welcomed by those who closely track volume numbers. &quot;Anything that tends to take away a distortion would be a positive,&quot; says Alan Shaw of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.    ---                    NYSE Dividend Plays                   In millions of shares                                              Average Daily                           Average Daily      Dividend                           Volume             Play Volume    April                       162                11    May                         152                27    June                        195                30    July                        166                27    August (to 8/22)            157                29   Source: Knight-Ridder Tradecenter</TEXT></DOC>
