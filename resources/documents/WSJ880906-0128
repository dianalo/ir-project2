In June, Grupo Argentino, a consortium including the owner of Austral, the Argentine domestic airline, invited Swissair to participate in an offer to be proposed to Argentina as part of Aerolineas's privatization, Swissair said. Alitalia S.p.A. of Italy joined the talks. But Swissair said &quot;no genuine&quot; privatization now appears likely.    Two weeks ago, Argentina said Scandinavian Airline Systems agreed to buy 40% of Aerolineas for $204 million. Austral's owner said his group would top the SAS bid. It wasn't clear whether Alitalia would proceed with the offer. </TEXT></DOC>
