Sheik Nawaf Al-Ahmed also said a military deal that his countryconcluded with the Soviet Union over the weekend involved 245Soviet-made armored personnel carriers. He did not say whether theagreement, which a newspaper said was worth $300 million, coveredother equipment.   Kuwait's announcement came after another accord announced lastweek in which Saudi Arabia agreed to buy a wide array of weaponsfrom Britain. The huge deal was estimated to be worth $10 billion.   The Kuwaiti official spoke to reporters after a meeting withvisiting British Defense Secretary George Younger.   The Kuwaiti minister provided no details of the weapons Kuwaitmay purchase from Britain. Earlier reports said Younger's offerincluded Tornado warplanes.   Wednesday's announcement was made while Kuwaiti Crown PrinceSheik Saad Abdullah Sabah was in Washington pressing for a$1.9-billion arms deal involving 40 F-1-18 fighter-bombers andMaverick missiles.   However, Congress opposes including the missiles, and theKuwaitis have said they would turn to other sources to meet theirneeds.</TEXT></DOC>
