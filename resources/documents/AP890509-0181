Soldiers in the occupied West Bank fatally shot one Palestinianand wounded two in a raid on the village of Salfit, an armyofficial said. Arab reports said troopers wounded seven morePalestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   In the Arab-Jewish city of Akko in northern Israel, a27-year-old Jew fatally stabbed a 14-year-old Arab.   An Arab motorist caught the assailant, who has a history ofmental illness, police reported. They said the assailant told themotorist he stabbed the boy to avenge Arab attacks on Jews.   The two deaths brought to 467 the number of Palestinians killedin the uprising. Twenty-one Israelis also have died.   The violence came as Palestinians observed a general strikecalled by pro-PLO underground leaders to mark the beginning of the18th month of the uprising.   Palestinians in the occupied lands were blocked by the army fromentering Israel during Memorial and Independence Day holidays toprevent attacks on Israeli targets.   Memorial Day, during which Israel's 16,740 war dead are honored,began at sundown Monday and ended at sundown Tuesday, immediatelyfollowed by 24 hours of celebrations marking the 41st anniversaryof Israel's independence.   About 700,000 Gaza residents and 200,000 Palestinians in theWest Bank were kept under curfew. All 1 million West Bank residentswere barred from entering Israel during the two-day holiday.   On Tuesday, a two-minute siren during which Israelis nationwidestood at attention ushered in somber wreath-laying ceremonies at 40military cemeteries.   Most speeches focused on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel's Arab enemies,including the leaders of the uprising, have not changed theirultimate objective, the destruction of Israel.   ``Our enemies have the same aim, to remove us from here, even ifguns, tanks and planes are replaced with stones, knives andfirebombs,'' Rabin told mourning families at the Kiryat Shaulcemetery near Tel Aviv.   In an interview published Tuesday in the Maariv newspaper, hesaid he may order harsher tactics by soldiers to crush the uprising_ ``not tanks or air strikes, but more freedom for selectivetreatment or selective punishment.''   At a ceremony at the Kfar Warburg cemetery in southern Israel,mourners heckled left-wing legislator Dedi Zucker, shouting ``Gethim out! Get him out!''   Zucker, a reserve paratrooper who favors negotiations with thePLO and has been critical of the army's crackdown of the uprising,said he did not deliver his scheduled speech, fearing it would fuelmore anger.   He said the outburst appeared to have been sparked by Monday'sfuneral of Sgt. Avi Sassportaz, 21, who police believe was killedby Palestinians. After the funeral in the southern port city ofAshdod, hundreds of Israelis stoned Arab-owned cars.   In Jerusalem, right-wing demonstrators protesting last week'sslaying of two elderly Israelis by a Palestinian hanged the effigyof an Arab from a small wooden gallow. ``Death to Arab Murderers,''said a sign around the neck of the effigy, erected near where theslayings took place.   The two dozen protesters called for stronger measures to quellthe uprising.   ``Send the army to beat them. Chop off their hands ... Placethem up on the gallows and hang them until they are dead,'' saidGershon Salomon, head of the Temple Mount Faithful, a right-wingIsraeli group.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, meanwhile, said Palestinians whoparticipate in his proposed elections first must guarantee theywill not later claim they are the government of a Palestinian state.   He was quoted by the Jerusalem Post as saying ``theseprinciples'' must apply for the whole process of his peace plan.   Israeli police, meanwhile, had to contend with a pro-Syriandemonstration by Druse students in the Golan Heights, annexed byIsrael in 1981 after its capture from Syria 14 years earlier.   Police fired tear gas and arrested 52 people in the Drusevillage of Masada after hundreds of students stoned cars, chanted``Long live Syria!'' and burned an Israeli flag. The Druse are anoffshoot sect of Islam.</TEXT></DOC>
