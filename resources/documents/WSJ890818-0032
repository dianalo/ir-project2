Many dealers and analysts are currently predicting the dollar could climb back to its high levels of mid-June -- about 2.05 marks and 152 yen -- possibly as soon as early September.    In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.9647 marks, up from 1.9408 marks Wednesday, and at 143.53 yen, up from 142.10 yen. Sterling was at $1.5610, down from $1.5815.    In Tokyo Friday, the dollar opened for trading at 143.50 yen, up from Thursday's Tokyo close of 142.32 yen.    The U.S. currency stands well above the upper levels of the secret trading ranges within which most dealers and economists believe the Group of Seven major industrial countries have strived to keep the dollar since February 1987. These ranges are guessed to be 1.70-to-1.90 marks and 120-to-140 yen. The G-7 nations include the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.    Propelling the dollar was the Commerce Department announcement that the seasonally adjusted U.S. trade deficit for June had narrowed to $8.17 billion -- the lowest monthly deficit since December 1984 -- from a revised $10.08 billion in May. That month's deficit had been originally reported at $10.24 billion.    Many analysts earlier predicted the June deficit would be between $9 billion and $9.5 billion.    &quot;It was a good figure and was support for the positive mood about the dollar,&quot; said Andre Woerhoff, chief mark trader at DG Bank in Frankfurt. &quot;Everybody was looking to buy dollars.&quot; At one point in afternoon European activity, the dollar traded as high as 1.9719 marks and 144.05 yen before falling back on profit-taking and apprehension that central banks might intervene to try to push the currency lower.    Despite the relatively positive trade results, a strong dollar threatens to undermine international efforts to keep reducing the U.S. trade deficit and correspondingly high Japanese and West German surpluses. That's because a rising U.S. currency makes U.S. exports more expensive and reduces the cost of imports for U.S. consumers.    A major benefit of the strong dollar, however, is that it helps reduce U.S. inflationary pressures. By keeping a lid on import prices, a robust dollar inhibits the ability of U.S. manufacturers to raise their domestic prices.    The dollar began climbing in early European trading and rose to about 1.9545 and 142.90 yen just before the U.S. trade results were released. On the announcement, it shot up even further to 1.9695 marks and 143.50 yen.    By late in the day in New York, however, the U.S. currency retreated a bit. &quot;Everybody's looking over their shoulder and expecting that there'll be intervention at 1.97 {marks} and 144 {yen},&quot; said Charles Minnaar, a vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank. &quot;So it's a self-fulfilling prophecy; every time we get there, people take profits on any long positions.&quot;    There were rumors that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and some European central banks sold dollar at the 1.9680-mark level, but most traders discounted them.    Besides the lower trade deficit itself, traders were particularly encouraged by the fact that U.S. exports had increased in June while imports fell. &quot;It's not that the world slowed -- that there is less trade -- but that there's more desire abroad for consumption than here,&quot; said Richard Witten, vice president in charge of foreign-exchange trading at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;Other economies are expanding at a faster rate than ours; that means we can export more.&quot;    To the extent that export growth continues, &quot;it will keep the U.S. economy from slipping,&quot; added Mr. Witten. &quot;So you can have a soft-landing scenario based on expanding exports.&quot; A &quot;soft landing&quot; combines moderate economic growth with low inflation.    That, in turn, makes it less likely that the Fed will attempt to lower U.S. interest rates, say analysts. Higher U.S. interest rates relative to those in other countries tend to increase the dollar's attraction to international investors.    In fact, therein lies part of the dollar's underlying support. &quot;The mood of a few weeks ago of lower {U.S.} interest rates and a recession has changed,&quot; said Roberto Bianchi, a vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich.    Part of that trend is evident in short-term interest-rate movements. On Thursday, three-month Eurodollar deposits were quoted at 8.81% -- and at one point even as high as 8.88% -- up from 8.75% on Aug. 11. During the same period, equivalent mark rates receded to 6.88% from 6.94%.    Because of the change in sentiment toward the dollar, large short-dollar positions that had been built up several weeks ago in expectation that the currency would keep falling are still being unwound, said Mr. Bianchi. That trend adds to its recent strength.    In its latest run, the dollar has climbed 6.2% against the mark and 5.7% against its Japanese counterpart since Aug. 1 when it bottomed out at 1.8490 marks and 135.80 yen.    Mr. Bianchi predicts the dollar will climb to about 2.05 marks, 150 yen and 1.75 Swiss francs {from 1.6940 on Thursday} by Sept. 1 -- close to its levels of mid-June. In intraday trading on June 15, the U.S. currency reached 2.0475 marks -- its highest point since Nov. 10, 1986 -- and 151.85 yen, a 20-month peak.    &quot;There's good demand for dollars every time,&quot; the currency dips, he said. Citing the soft-landing thesis, Mr. Bianchi added: &quot;Meantime, the dollar looks, by comparison, the best currency around.&quot;    Mr. Woerhoff of DG Bank says he thinks likewise, except he believes the dollar will initially dip to about 1.9250 marks before rising sharply to 2.00 to 2.05 marks.    Mr. Witten of Goldman Sachs predicted that within the next 12 months, &quot;we will see the dollar between 2.10 and 2.20 marks and 160-to-165 yen.&quot;    Traders were a little surprised at the apparent lack of central-bank intervention, particularly after as many as 11 central banks sold dollars in an attempt to stem the currency's rise last Friday.    &quot;It's useless to intervene in a market where there's a bullish mood; it's just an opportunity to get cheap dollars,&quot; said Mr. Woerhoff. He predicted the central banks will wait until they detect a change in the currency's direction &quot;and then intervene on the downside. Otherwise, they have no impact.&quot;    Yoshindo Takahashi, president of Nomura Research Institute's U.S. unit in New York, said a point had been reached where a weaker dollar wouldn't add much more to U.S. export strength and that U.S. industry was still competitive with the dollar at 135-to-145 yen. &quot;We are almost at the end of foreign-exchange adjustment,&quot; he said.    In the U.S., he added, &quot;there is a medium-to-long term emphasis on the reduction of the cost of capital, which means lower interest rates and higher stock prices. These can only be achieved by keeping the dollar strong.&quot;    Mr. Minnaar of Chase said the {U.S.} administration will become more concerned once the dollar climbed to 2.00 marks and 150 yen. &quot;Let's face it,&quot; he added. &quot;With improving trade numbers, it's hard to keep on talking the dollar down.&quot;    On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $368.30 an ounce, up 10 cents. Estimated volume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.    In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $366.15 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
