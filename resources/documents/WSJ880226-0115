In the summer of 1967, civil-rights advocates repeatedly marched across it, demanding an open-housing ordinance. Opponents assaulted the demonstrators with rocks, dirty dishwater and racial epithets.    Today, the half-mile-long bridge has once again become the center of a stormy debate. Earlier this year, the City Council voted to name it after James E. Groppi, a former priest and leader of those rallies who died three years ago of cancer.    But Mayor Henry W. Maier vetoed the renaming, denouncing Mr. Groppi as &quot;divisive.&quot; Shortly afterward, a black leader, who had been honored with the city's first Martin Luther King Jr. Award, angrily returned it.    For many here, the 16th Street viaduct symbolizes the divisions between blacks and whites in this city; it also separates the mainly white south side and the north side, which is home to most of the city's blacks. The situation in Milwaukee shows that many of the issues raised by the Kerner Commission in 1968 continue unresolved today.    What makes Milwaukee an even more compelling example is that it has long been admired by many civil-rights leaders for its progressive tradition. Milwaukee elected its first black council member in 1957, before most other major cities. And where the 1967 civil disturbances led to numerous deaths in cities such as Newark and Detroit, Milwaukee received national praise for pacifying demonstrators before they got out of hand. The city's mayor was one of those who testified before the Kerner Commission.    Today, despite Milwaukee's efforts to make progress, its blacks are becoming increasingly outspoken about their feelings of isolation and inequality. An astonishing 27% of blacks in the city are unemployed. The typical black student has below a C average. And according to the Urban League, nearly 40% of the city's blacks live in poverty.    &quot;I want to say we're doing better, but all evidence says we're not,&quot; says Marvin Pratt, a first-term black city councilman. &quot;We're separate and unequal.&quot;    The soft-spoken and politically moderate Mr. Pratt represents a largely black district. His neighborhood of red-brick homes and tree-lined streets is a model of the rising black middle class. Among those who live on his block are a retired postal worker, a building inspector and a landlord. On Mr. Pratt's living-room sofa sits a black Cabbage Patch doll, a symbol of the rising black middle-income consumer.    But as Mr. Pratt drives to work every morning, he must pass through the southern end of his district: leaning clapboard homes, boarded-up stores and vacant lots. It is stark testimony to the loss of jobs in the central city; in the past eight years, says the mayor's office, the number of jobs in the city has dropped by 9% while the number of jobs in the suburbs has increased by 12.6%. The city's blacks have been the big losers.    &quot;I can have on a suit and coat, have a job, but then there's a whole host of people who are barely making it,&quot; Mr. Pratt says as he walks into a soup kitchen in his district. &quot;Walking in here helps me keep my feet on the ground. It reminds me of how in some ways we've gone backward.&quot;    Mr. Pratt, like others here, scorns the area's de facto segregation. The suburbs have been virtually inaccessible for blacks. Only 2% of the area's blacks live in the suburbs, the rest in the central city. That has remained unchanged for 20 years. One western suburb, Wauwatosa, in 1979 turned down federal money to build 188 low-income housing units because of opposition from the community.    The Urban League recently issued a report entitled &quot;The Racial Gap in Milwaukee,&quot; a kind of latter-day Kerner report, which presented a flurry of statistics on the stark differences in the quality of life for the city's blacks and whites.    &quot;It's a failing report card for the movers and shakers here,&quot; says Wesley L. Scott, urban-affairs consultant to the local Chamber of Commerce.    Marvin Pratt still envisions progress. &quot;I just keep working at it,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm hopeful.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;Racial Gulf: Blacks' Hopes, Raised by '68 Kerner Report, Are Mainly Unfulfilled --- Despite Gains, Their Position Changes Little Relatively; Growth of the Underclass --- 'We're Having Quiet Riots'&quot; -- WSJ Feb. 26, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
