Under the one-year contract, KN will pay about $1.84 per million British thermal units next year, up from about $1.74 in 1989. KN, a Lakewood, Colo., gas distribution concern, purchases about 92% of the natural gas produced by Plains.    Plains said the higher price will raise its 1990 revenue by about $2 million.    Under a separate agreement, KN agreed to end certain contracts and allow Plains to sell natural gas previously dedicated to KN. Plains said the amount of reserves released from the contracts represents about 6% of its total volume. </TEXT></DOC>
