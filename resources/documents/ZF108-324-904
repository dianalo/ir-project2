(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Electrohome ECM 1310U When we first reviewed the Electrohome ECM 1310U in ourMay 31, 1988, issue, it carried a list price of $895.andP;  We awarded it anEditor's Choice for its superb colors and sharp picture.andP;  When we reviewedthe 1310U in the May 16, 1989, issue, the price had risen to $1,198, and thecompetition had caught up: Taxan and NEC each garnered Editor's Choiceawards.andP;  This year, the 1310U still has the same maximum resolution of 800 by600, the same multiscanning capabilities, and the same .31-mm dot pitch.andP;  Butthe competition has advanced even more, and the price of the ECM 1310U hasclimbed to $1,259.andM;Why pay so much for a 13-inch monitor?andP;  Unless you find yourself needing todaisy-chain a few monitors together, you probably shouldn't.andP;  The only realadvantage the 1310U can claim over the competition is its dual sets of BNCjacks: one set for the input signal and one for an output signal.andP;  Each setincludes one jact each for the red, green, and blue signals, plus separatejacks for horizontal and vertical sync signals.andP;  Each input jack also has itsown dedicated terminator switch, which allows the signal to be passed ontothe corresponding output jack when open.andM;Despite its skimpy, three-page manual and abundance of connectors, the 1310Uinstalls with little difficulty.andP;  Once you've found a BNC-5-to-DB-15 cable(Electrohome will sell you one for $99) attaching the monitor to a VGAadapter is quite straightforward.andP;  If you're connecting the monitor to CGA,EGA, or PGA adapter, simply set the TTL/analog switch accordingly and plugthe cable into the monitor's DB-9 TTL connector.andM;Our evaluation unit excelled in some respects during testing and sufferedfrom serious limitations in others.andP;  On the upside, the 1310U generates asharp, bright display that rivals the best .31-mm-dot-pitch models.andP;  Colorsare true and vibrant.andM;The 1310U's most serious limiation has got to be its lack of automatic imagesizing.andP;  In VGA modes, the vertical image size changed significantly, rangingin height from 6.5 to 8 inches.andP;  Of course, you can adjust the image sizemanually: the back panel of the monitor accommodates two sets ofimage-adjustment knobs--one for TTL modes, the other for analog.andP;  All of theanalog controls, with the exception of the horizontal-size control, providedample adjustment in VGA modes.andP;  However, that doesn't lessen the frustrationof having to adjust them every time you jump from a 350-line mode to a480-line mode.andM;The 1310U monitor comes with an etched, nonglare screen and uses ashort-persistence phosphor--the best combination for most users.andP;  Electrohomesells two additional monitors, the 1311 and 1312, that are identical to the1310U in every respect but phosphor and screen glass.andP;  The 1312, for example,with its clear, polished screen and long-persistence phosphor, is meant forapplications that demand top picture sharpness, such as CAD.andM;If you need to daisy-chain monitors or if your specific application requiresBNC-5 connectors, you'll undoubtedly be happy with the ECM 1310U.andP;  Fr therest of us, however, this monitor just doesn't make sense.andP;  For what it takesto buy the 1310U, you could almost buy two monitors that would do the job aswell and include autosizing in the bargain</TEXT></DOC>
