<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-85-0109 </DOCNO><TEXT>Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. has advanced the developmentof Integrated Nuclear Plant Piping System (INUPPS) for nuclear powerplants since 1980, and continued its improvement up to now. This timeas its component, a piping support system (PISUP) has been developed.The piping support system deals with the structures such as piping supportsand the stands for maintenance and inspection, and as for standard supportingstructures, it builds up automatically the structures including the selectionof optimum members by utilizing the standard patterns in cooperationwith the piping design system including piping stress analysis. As forthe supporting structures deviating from the standard, by amending apart of the standard patterns in dialogue from, structures can be builtup. By using the data produced in this way, this system draws up consistentlya design book, production management data and so on. From the viewpointof safety, particular consideration is given to the aseismatic capabilityof nuclear power plants, and piping is fundamentally designed regidlyto avoid resonance. It is necessary to make piping supports so as tohave sufficient strength and rigidity. The features of the design ofpiping supports for nuclear power plant, the basic concept of pipingsupport system, the constitution of the software and hardware, the standardpatterns and the structural patterns of piping support system and soon are described.
