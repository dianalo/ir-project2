(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Northwest Airlines said today it has reacheda tentative four-year contract agreement covering its 10,000mechanics and ground service employees.   The company also signed a contract today with the unionrepresenting 6,700 flight attendants. The union announced earliertoday that its members had ratified the tentative agreement.   The agreement with the International Association of MachinistsDistrict Lodge 143 unifies three contracts covering former RepublicAirlines workers and Northwest workers. The two Minneapolis-basedairlines merged in 1986.   Terry Erskine, the airline's vice president of law and laborrelations, said the agreement was reached Thursday night after twoweeks of negotiations.   The agreement will bring former Republic workers to parity withtheir Northwest counterparts by increasing wages an average of 20percent for ramp-service employees and 13 percent for mechanics andrelated personnel, Erskine said.   Guy Cook, president and general chairman of IAM District Lodge143, announced the tentative agreement from Atlanta at the sametime Erskine made the announcement at a news conference in Eagan.   It was not immediately known whether the union was recommendingapproval or rejection of the contract.   Erskine said the ratification process will begin next week andtake a month or six weeks to complete.   In addition to equalizing wages, the proposed agreement wouldinclude an average pay increase of about 3.2 percent a year for allemployees covered by the contract.   Erskine said the agreement also unifies work rules, pensions andbenefits, all modeled after the Northwest mechanics' contract.   The proposed contract also includes a 5-year, new-hire pay scalewith entry level wages 17 percent lower than current rates forunskilled and semi-skilled jobs.   The tentative contract agreement with the flight attendants wasreached on March 22, ending a strike threatened for March 29.   Suzanne Balzer, a spokeswoman for Teamsters Local 2747, saidthis morning that 61 percent, or 2,854 attendants, approved thecontract, which 1,829 or 39 percent voted against.   ``We're pleased that it was that strong a ``for'' voteconsidering the group of people who were trying to run a ``no''vote campaign,'' Ms. Balzer said.   A simple majority of the attendants voting was needed to ratify;6,646 were eligible to vote.   The Teamsters bargaining committee passed the contract proposalto union members without recommending approval or rejection. Unionofficials had said they expected it to be ratified.   The pact would take effect June 1 and expire Dec. 31, 1992, butwould not be retroactive to the contract starting date of Jan. 1,1987.   The pact merges two labor agreements to provide common wages,fringe benefits and work rules for all flight attendants.   Under one section of the proposal, flight attendants who workedfor the Minneapolis-based Republic Airlines before it merged withNorthwest in 1986 will receive pay raises averaging 18 percent,effective June 1. This will raise them to the highest wage rates oforiginal Northwest attendants.</TEXT></DOC>
