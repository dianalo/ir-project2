The current plans are to implement approximately 39 newprojects. These projects will address specific issues related to enhancingthe quality of work, the productivity of workers, and labor market efficiencyinto the 21st century.This notice serves to alert interested parties to ETA's plan. It does notsolicit applications or proposals. Solicitations for grant award (SGAs)or requests for proposals (RFPs) will be announced in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and the ``Commerce Business Daily,'' respectively,the months ahead. Some projects will result from intra-agency agreementswith such organizations as the Department's Women's Bureau and Bureau ofInternational Labor Affairs, and an agreement with the Department of Healthand Human Services. In some cases, these agencies will offer competitionsfor the projects. Some future competitions may be limited (for example,among States, Service Delivery Areas, or Private Industry Councils underthe Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) program) and, therefore, will beannounced only through ETA's administrative communications system. Theseprocurement plans are subject to change; one or more of these may not beissued and/or others may be added. This announcement is for general informationpurposes to indicate the direction of the R,E,Pandamp;D agenda.There are seven subject areas for these projects. These are:  <ITAG tagnum="15">(1) Workforce 2000,  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(2) Youth 2000,  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(3) Workplace Literacy,  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(4) Worker Adjustment,  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(5) Women, Family and Welfare,  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(6) Immigration, and  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(7) Improving the Training and Employment System.  </ITAG>This announcement consists of three parts.

Part III discussesthe pre-bidders' conference.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Part I_Background  </ITAG>A. Mission of the Employment and Training Administration and its Research,Evaluation, Pilot and Demonstration Program  ETA is the Federal agency with the lead responsibility for the FederalGovernment's training and employment programs. Both U.S. workers and employers,and ultimately the economy, benefit from the comprehensive system of trainingand employment programs ETA administers. Its major programs include:  <ITAG tagnum="15">_JTPA which consists of a wide range of activities targeted to individualgroups who need job-related assistance, with emphasis on economically disadvantagedyouth and adults, dislocated workers, and others who face severe problemsin the job market,  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The Employment Service System which operates as a labor exchange,matching workers with available jobs, as well as carrying out other functions; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The Unemployment Insurance program which provides limited compensationto workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own; and  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Trade Adjustment Assistance which is available to workers who losetheir jobs as a result of increased imports.</ITAG>ETA's R,E,Pandamp;D program is operated to measure the impact and effectivenessof the agency's various activities, explore new program concepts, techniquesand designs, and to assist the Nation in expanding current and future workopportunities and assuring access to those opportunities for all who desirethem. ETA carries out its R,E,Pandamp;D program through State and local publicagencies, private-for-profit and nonprofit organizations, colleges anduniversities, community-based and labor groups, and other Federal agencies. B. Workforce 2000  R,E,Pandamp;D projects for Program Year 1988, which began on July 1, 1988,will continue to focus on workplace issues confronting the Nation throughthe year 2000. These issues, initiated in Program Year 1987, were the outcomeof a 17-month study sponsored by the Department and included in the report``Workforce 2000: Work and Workers for the Twenty-first Century''. Thereport, prepared by the Hudson Institute, crystallized key issues and questionsthe Nation must deal with if it is to prosper in the intensely competitiveand technologically sophisticated global market of the 21st Century. Forexample the U.S. must:  <ITAG tagnum="15">_Fully integrate women, blacks, Hispanics, immigrants, and handicappedworkers into the economy. The labor force will grow more slowly over thenext 16 years than at any time in U.S. history, except during the decadeof the Great Depression. The net growth in workers will be predominantlywomen, blacks and immigrants, sources of labor that have long been underutilized.Because there will be fewer young people beginning their careers overall,this could provide opportunities to bring groups historically underusedinto full participation in the economy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Provide the work force with the education and skills new jobs inthe expanding service-oriented economy will demand. Most new jobs in fastgrowing service industries will require higher levels of reading, mathand reasoning skills than traditional jobs in manufacturing industries.Individuals with less than a high school education will face increasingdifficulty in finding work and fewer opportunities for good pay and advancement.Yet 700,000 students drop out of school each year, and literacy has becomea major problem among young adults.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Ensure that the increasingly middle-aged work force is adaptableand retains its willingness to learn. The rapidly changing economy willdemand workers who are flexible and willing to respond to new opportunitiesand conditions. Workers with years of experience often lack the flexibilityand specialized skills they need to move into expanding industries.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Reconcile the conflicting demands of work and family responsibilitiesespecially for women. The increase in the labor force participation ofmothers, including women with young children, has been striking. As ofMarch 1987, 66.6% of women with children under 18 and fifty-two percentof mothers with children under 2 years were in the labor force. Welfaremothers and displaced homemakers are among groups needing special consideration.</ITAG>A basic step in meeting these challenges is strengthening ETA's informationbase. the R,E,Pandamp;D procurement plan announced in this notice is designedto provide more complete information to enable the agency to better understandand deal with specific issues.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part II_Subject Areas</ITAG>A. Workforce 2000The U.S. economy is expected to continue to grow at least at its currentrate through the year 2000. Nonetheless, the efficiency of our labor marketswill be severely tested. More sophisticated jobs will demand greater skills.Fewer young people will be entering the labor market, and a growing fractionwill be minorities who are traditionally educationally disadvantaged asa group. Greater flexibility will be demanded of all workers, but particularlythe middle aged worker. In the anticipated tight labor market of the year2000, employers will be forced to either seek out and invest in workersheretofore underutilized, or to bid up wages or export jobs overseas.A critical part of any planning for the future is a sound information base.The work effort sought through these Workforce 2000 projects is intendedto supplement and expand on information bases for National, local, andoccupation-specific improvements.Two of the studies are proposed as interagency agreements with the Department'sWomen's Bureau and the Department of Health and Human Services.ETA plans to solicit a support contract to develop background researchon current and emerging policy and legislative trends to augment the continuingsearch for information upon which future public policy can be based.The dynamism and efficiency of labor markets relies on accessible and timelyinformation. Given the changes that continue to occur in markets for varioususers and providers of information, ETA intends to evaluate the adequacyof existing Labor Market Information (LMI) systems at Federal, State andlocal levels. The needs of LMI users at all levels in private industryand in educational institutions need to be assessed.Apparent shortages in some professional occupations such as nursing haveresulted in permitting non-U.S. workers into the country, possibly depressingwages and working conditions. This, in turn, may have further aggravatedproblems with domestic labor supplies. ETA wishes to research the dynamicsthat have created the scarcity of such professionals and the resultingpolicy responses through a series of case studies. Information is neededin order to develop a coherent public policy regarding selective shortagesof qualified workers.Some cities are already presaging future labor shortages in their growinghighly skilled service sector. ETA will sponsor through the Women's Bureaua series of community case studies to document the economic and labor marketchanges and record the perspectives of those directly affected by suchlabor market changes. The studies in a number of the largest cities withtight labor markets will provide insights into what adjustments and actionswill be necessary to cope with these changes.The joint study with HHS will investigate in finer detail the effects ofgeographic concentration on unemployment, underemployment, welfare useand dependency. ETA's support will permit the study to be directed to itsinformation needs, with particular attention to young minority males livingin such areas.B. Youth 2000Improving the educational preparedness of workers is a challenge we mustmeet to be competitive into the 21st century. This is most important forour young people. Today's youth at risk of dropping out are our entry levelworkers of the next two decades. They face jobs demanding higher skillsin math, reading and communications. Yet recent studies have shown thatmany of these youth are reading, writing, and computing at levels belowpresent day expectations. Further, many of these youth are disenfranchisedfrom and disillusioned with schools, and fail to see the connection withgood paying jobs.ETA intends to closely examine programs that seem successful in helpingour youth make the connection between education and work. A number of programslinking school and employment and training programs with apprenticeshipare successfully operating. In an effort to inform and encourage expansionof these school/training-to-work bridges, these programs and the factorsthat make them successful need to be identified. Publication of a popularbooklet about these programs could provide incentives for program operatorsto get involved in similar ventures, and capture the interest of youngpeople.Another concern about making connections is in effectively linking manyFederal, State and local youth services programs, particularly schools,with JTPA programs serving disadvantaged youth. We need to do a betterjob of attracting and retaining at-risk youth. An assessment is thereforeplaned to document effective recruitment practices, and identify gaps inservices. Counseling practices/components including the different disciplinaryand supportive atmospheres need to be examined as well as the range ofservices offered to in-school youth.ETA will solicit a quick-turnaround evaluation capacity for the Job Corpsprogram in support of several initiatives. Recognizing the need for increasedcommunication skills, the Job Corps developed a new GED curriculum withgreater emphasis on writing skills. An evaluation is planned to test itseffectiveness, and the effectiveness of other new program concepts nowbeing piloted. Another evaluation effort is planned to examine assessmenttools for rating the quality of the physical learning environment.ETA offered a competitive grant, which closed in late August, to promotereplication of the Summer Training and Education Program (STEP), whichprovides summer remediation and life skills instruction. STEP programminghas proven to reduce learning losses that usually occur over the summermonths.C. Workplace literacyAs the remainder of this century unfolds, it is expected that jobs requiringhigher levels of literacy and analytic skills will increase, and thoserequiring only strength and manual ability will shrink. Further, the populationgroups presently in jobs with lesser skill requirements can expect a moredifficult time in the job markets ahead, unless their literacy skills areincreased. In addition to increased skills, increased flexibility to newworking conditions, new technology and new environments will be required.In the rapidly increasing service sector, the jobs will spring up in placesto accommodate customers. Job mobility will be required. Effective mobilityrests on the premise that skills learned and tested in one area will berated and recognized in another.ETA has undertaken a wide variety of programs to explore, test and demonstratenew learning techniques and programs for groups in particular need of enhancingtheir workplace literacy skills. Most of these R,E,Pandamp;D efforts arepresently underway. The primary focus of this Program Year's workplaceliteracy projects will be on assessing the validity of existing testingand certification practices.Vocational and educational accomplishments are sometimes recognized bycertificates of competency which are developed for an acknowledged in onlya limited environment. An extensive literature review is needed to assessthe competencies certification experience in the training and employmentsystem, including the views of National and State specialists and certifyingorganizations. The review would serve as the basis for determining thefeasibility of developing an employer validated, protable certificate ofoccupational competencies that would be awarded based upon tested competencies.The National Academy of Sciences will complete its study of the GeneralAptitude Test Battery (GATB) Validity Generalization in February. It isexpected that their findings will result in additional research or evaluationstudies related to the GATB, specific ES applicant groups tested by theGATB, and/or ETA/U.S. Employment Service (USES) test research programsto determine whether the current work priorities meet State and DOL needsand how the test research may be focused upon any deficiencies identifiedby the NAS review, and answer any concerns arising from the overall GATBreview.Although ETA is not announcing its expectations for further study, it iscontingent on findings of the on-going study.D. Worker adjustment assistanceTrade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and JTPA Title III Programs are availableto assist dislocated workers train for and find new employment. Major newlegislation was enacted this year substantially revising and expandingthese important programs. Several projects are intended to complement theimplementation of these legislative changes.ETA will solicit an implementation analysis of the new worker adjustmentprogram, documenting startup successes and problems. ETA also intends toevaluate the TAA program to determine its effectiveness in serving workerswhose jobs and skills become obsolete because of foreign imports. The program'simpact has not been assessed since it became primarily an extended unemploymentinsurance and job training program in the early 1980's.In order to promote improved, comprehensive services for dislocated workers,ETA plans to compete multiple grants to States to demonstrate a unifiedworker adjustment program, fully integrating JTPA Title III and TAA servicedelivery. Voucher programs for retraining would also be tested and implemented.The intent is to document and disseminate model implementation designs.When a firm is viable but jobs within it become obsolete because of newtechnology, upgrade training might be considered. Upgrade training mightprevent dislocation by retraining workers in obsolete jobs for new workin their employing firm. However, upgrade training is not available underJTPA Title III, since a layoff notice is required for eligibility. It isallowable under Title II-A, though of limited applicability. Therefore,a study is planned to identify the public policy issues which upgrade trainingraises, and review previous government sponsored upgrading programs, andthe views of unions, employers, and workers toward upgrade training.E. Women, work and familySince the mid-1940's the labor force participation rate for women has growndramatically from about 33% to more than 70%. Last year, 66.7% of womenwith children participated in the labor force. The rate for mothers withtoddlers was 55.2%, more than double the rate of only 20 years ago.Contrary to popular belief, most working women (78%) work full-time, andonly 17% work part time voluntarily. Estimates for the remainder of thecentury indicate that women will increase their labor force participation,at a slower rate. By the year 2000, the labor force participation ratefor women is expected to reach 81%, while that of men will be nearly 93%. Clearly, the conflicts between work and family needs will increase. Amongthese conflicts are the adequacy of arrangements for the care of childrenand elderly family members. As women continue to work more hours per weekand more weeks per year, solutions to this problem will become increasinglycritical.  Solutions will have to include flexible hours to care for sick childrenand dependents, and the overall time and financial resources to raise children.Better paying, full-time, skilled jobs will be needed by many women toadequately care for their families and their own occupational aspirations.A series of projects under this topic area will be funded through an interagencyagreement with the Department of Labor's Women's Bureau.  Women have been traditionally underrepresented in apprenticeable and otherhighly skilled occupations, which also tend to be highly paid. Employmentopportunities in the construction trades are expected to increase throughthe Year 2000. A conference is planned to convene tradeswomen and organizationsrepresenting them (such as the construction union) to share informationand develop strategies to facilitate women's entry into the skilled trades.The ETA Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training may also participate. Itshould be noted that a contractor has been selected for the conference. The Women's Bureau is developing a work and family clearinghouse that willprovide current statistics, bibliographic references and an inventory ofmodel employer practices in three work and family areas: child and eldercare, alternative work scheduling and flexible leave, and benefit polices.This project will permit the clearinghouse to be augmented by a referralnetwork linking it to major sources of privately maintained informationon dependent care. It will also permit an expansion of the data base. Employers,unions, public officials, researchers, and dependent care advocates areamong those expected to use the clearinghouse.  Specific implementation information is needed on work and family optionsfor small employers. Generally, it is the large firms who support policiesand programs responsive to work and family concerns, such as employer-sponsoredday care and flexible benefits and work hours. The majority of employment,however, is in small to medium sized firms. Options are available suchas cooperative pooling with other small firms to jointly support a childcare center, or a referral system. This project would support the researchand publication of ideas and information that could encourage the involvementof these smaller firms.  F. Improving the Training and Employment System  ETA will focus its planned systems improvements in two major areas: JTPAperformance management and Unemployment Insurance (UI) progamming.  Some JTPA program operators use 6% funds to experiment with new programdesigns serving clients with the most severe employment related problems.These programs cost considerably more to operate and may not currentlybe included in calculations of performance against Title II-A standards.A study is planned to analyze and compare the characteristics of clients,types of training and services provided, costs and outcomes with more typicalprograms clients. As part of the same RFP, ETA plans to compete a contractfor statistical support for the development and refinement of the nationwidesystem of performance standards.  It is asserted that the countercyclical stimulus that UI dollars have onthe economy has decreased by almost one-fourth. A study is planned to developa methodology to measure the effectiveness of the UI program as a fiscalstabilizer over the course of the business cycle.  ETA plans to offer a contract to research and publish successful UI paymentprogram improvements. The contractor will identify agencies which havedeveloped special organizational structures or mechanism and program processesfor the formulation and institution of practical program improvement measuresdriven by Quality Control data. Case studies will be developed and how-tomanuals prepared for distribution to State Employment Security Agencies(SESAs).  States are becoming increasingly reliant on automated systems for basicUI functions. Major disruption of services on a State-wide basis couldensue if a major disaster or deliberate destruction of these systems occurred.Therefore, a general disaster recovery/contingency plan should be developedin the form of a technical assistance guide for State use in such an emergency.   In FY 1987, a new UI cash management/banking system was developed. Thispermits SESAs to select from numerous cash management techniques and bankingsystem interfaces, to adopt the combination best suited to the individualState, and to provide overall improved UTF cash management. Technical assistanceand support are sought to facilitate this transition until staff becomeproficient in the administration, operation and maintenance of the newsystem.G. ImmigrationNew and proposed immigration legislation, particularly the Immigrationand Nationality Act, as amended by the Immigration Reform and Control Actof 1986 (IRCA), will promote widespread changes in the conduct of alienlabor certification. The Department of Agriculture and three of the Departmentof Labor's agencies share many of the research and implementation responsibilities.Among these, IRCA charges the Secretaries of Labor and Agriculture to determinethe supply conditions facing agricultural employers over the first threeyears of the next decade. The Department also has responsibilities underIRCA to analyze the impact of employer sanctions on employment, wages andworking conditions of U.S. workers and on the economy, and to prepare atriennial report on the economic and labor market impacts of admissionsof immigrants, refugees, asylees, and parolees into the U.S.Two of the proposed projects will be competed by ETA. Four interagencyagreements are planned, two each with the Office of the Assistant Secretaryfor Policy (OASP) and with the Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB).DOL has consistently proposed changes in legislation which would permitthe use of general labor market information as a basis for making permanentalien labor certification determinations rather than the current case-by-casetesting of the labor market. Since such a proposal is now being seriouslyand quickly considered, DOL wishes to begin specific planning for implementation.This implementation study would include identification of suitable datasources, specific criteria for determining shortage/surplus occupationsand estimated costs for regular updates of finding. Another planned projectwould analyze the current operation of the permanent alien labor certificationprogram, and assess its impact on employers and U.S. workers with the goalof improving its efficiency and effectiveness.With respect to temporary alien agricultural (H-2A) certifications, ETA/OASPwill jointly administer several case study demonstration projects in whicha ``supply area'' of domestic workers will be paired with a ``receivingindustry'' to determine whether ``positive recruitment'' efforts made byemployers to find domestic labor are effective as an alternative to theuse of H-2A workers. Also, as required by IRCA, a determination will bemade as to whether the ``50-percent rule'' of the H-2A program should becontinued.To assist in determining the labor supply conditions facing agriculturalemployers, and the IRCA requirement to stay abreast of changes in wages,working conditions, and recruitment practices, ETA and OASP propose interviewing:(1) A random sample of perishable crop employers to determine how theyhave adapted to changes in the supply of labor caused by IRCA; and (2)a random sample of workers employed by these employers during peak seasonalcrop activities, to determine exit and entry rates of seasonal agriculturalworkers.Using R,E,Pandamp;D funds through an intra-agency agreement, ILAB plans tofund three studies on the impact of IRCA sanctions on traditionally heavyusers of illegal workers. These studies will focus on understanding theemployment patterns of illegal workers and how both employers and the newlylegalized workers respond to legalization and employer sanctions.As part of the first phase of the triennial report, ILAB plans to exploreinformation about the labor market behavior of different types of legalalien workers. This would permit more accurate evaluation of calims andcounterclaims by those who petition for H-2B (i.e., temporary nonagricultural)workers. The second phase survey methodology would also be developed aspart of this study.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part III_Procurement plan Conference</ITAG>A procurement plan conference will be held on Friday, October 7, 1988,at 9:00 a.m. at the Department Auditorium of the Department of Labor, 200Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210.The Conference will be held for the following purposes:(1) To summarize ETA's Program Year 1988 procurement plan:(2) To describe in general terms the agency's procurement processes;(3) To present the expected timetable for issuance of SGA's and RFP's;and(4) To introduce ETA's R,E,Pandamp;D program to individuals and organizationswhich have not recently participated in the agency's activities.No additional substantive detail on the subject areas will be providedat the conference.
