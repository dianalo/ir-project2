Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.) has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for a report on all pre-bid purchases of takeover stocks by the arbitrage departments of eight major investment banking firms over a five-year period.    At the same time, Sen. Proxmire's staff has begun looking into the impact of corporate takeovers on the nation's work force. He asked Labor Secretary William Brock for a tally of job losses resulting from 24 takeovers or corporate restructurings triggered by hostile bids since January 1985.    Mr. Proxmire also requested a report on any withdrawals of pension-fund assets by acquiring companies. Some takeovers have been inspired in part by large surpluses in employee pension funds.    In a letter last Monday to SEC Chairman John Shad, Sen. Proxmire cited a recent SEC study of 172 successful tender offers between 1981 and 1985. Staff economists found that pre-bid buying drives up the target company's stock price by nearly 40% of the premium paid in a successful tender offer.    Sen. Proxmire also requested a report on the eight firms' annual profits, including how much each firm's arbitrage department earned from pre-bid trading in any of the 172 takeover stocks. The firms are Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., First Boston Corp., Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., Salomon Brothers Inc. and American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. unit. </TEXT></DOC>
