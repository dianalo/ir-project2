 McLuhan focused on the effects ofbroadcast media.andP;  We enjoy networks that alilow much richer and useful modesof communication: two-way, many-to-one, one-to-many, asynchronous, orreal-time.andM;Our computer communications networks are of tremendous value to the technicalcommunity.andP;  For a while electronic mail and the ability to transfer softwarearound the ARPANet were merely interesting.andP;  They are rapidly becomingindispensable tools for rapid technical development.andP;  Browse a typical Usenettechnical bulletin board--my favorite happens to becomp.prog.postscript--there you will find the equivalent of a hallwayconversation in a technical laboratory.andP;  However, this one happens to involvehundreds of people around the world and goes on continually, focused on asingle subject.andP;  There are many other notable bulletin boards: unix.wizards,the risks digest, soc.china, and the infamous alt.sex.andP;  Like a city, theseelectronic media provide tremendous opportunities for commerce, learning, andentertainment because they give one access to large numbers of people onewould never find in less connected environments.andP;  They support tremendousdiversity and allow one a free choice of what to read and to whom to speak.andM;Along with the openness, diversity, and size come certain problems.andP;  Peoplecan bother you with junk mail, hackers can disrupt your computer systems withworms and viruses, people can get at information you would prefer to beprivate and even broadcast it if they choose.andP;  Like a big city, the academicnetworks are not under anyone's control.andP;  They carry any kind ofcommunication without regard to its correctness, tastefulness, or legality.andO;This contributes to their usefulness.andP;  It should be noted that the completelyanarchic Usenet, which can be expanded by local whim, generates over 65,000public messages a month while the more controlled ARPANet generates about10,000 messages.andM;In a village where everyone knows each other, control can be exercisedthrough non-network channels.andP;  Certain communities, as a matter of policy,impose no security on their computer system.andP;  This makes it possible foranyone to crash the system whenever they wish, thereby removing theexcitement associated with doing it by cunning.andP;  However, as our computersystems have grown from village-sized enterprises to city-sized ones, suchstratagems are less effective.andM;How shall we control the problems of the emerging electronic global city?andO;Real cities have had problems and continue to have them.andP;  The plagues cameabout after urbanization but before sanitation.andP;  When crime reachesunacceptable levels cities employ anti-social measures like curfews.andP;  Therewill not be many simple, technical solutions because this system involvesmany human goals and compromises.andP;  The following are some opinions about whatthe network community should do, based on my observations of many networks inacademe and industry.andM;Don't worry about public anti-social behavior; it can be controlled throughnormal social processes.andP;  The same networks that permit one person to offendothers allow those others to express their displeasure.andP;  I often seediscussions on bulletin boards about the appropriate behavior for thatparticular board.andP;  Persistent bad behavior can be dealt with through thelegal system.andP;  We should generally rely on traditional means to control suchthings.andP;  The harder problem is covert disruption or misuse of networks.andM;Keep the networks open.andP;  Virtually all of the people involved in a networkare basically well-meaning and careful.andP;  The challenge is protecting them andthe system from the tiny number who are malicious or foolish.andP;  Making itimpossible for the latter to carry out their nefarious activities mightserious inconvenience everyone else.andP;  We must seek out ways of controllingaberrant activities without impeding communication.andM;Avoid anonymous usage.andP;  The intrinsic anonymity of computer systems must beredressed by better ways of authenticating the creators and users ofinformation.andP;  There are obviously situations in which anonymity isdesirable--an AIDS conference, for example--but they are the exception.andP;  Theuse of authenticated communications must be made much more convenient; then ahigher standard of identification could be demanded.andM;Augment permission-based security systems with access-monitoring systems.andO;Making the right a priori decision about who can read or modify a given database is hard.andP;  In many situations, it would be nice to allow a class of userscertain access, on condition that all accesses will be recorded.andP;  The systemcan then be relatively open, but one has better information in tracking downmiscreants.andP;  Such a system is more expensive because you have to saveinformation, but the phone companies have shown that it is possible.andP;  Somepeople might object to having what they read monitored, so the system shouldgive adequate warnings.andM;Actively monitor system usage--by hand.andP;  Since the number of people causingtrouble on networks is tiny, it is much better to watch out for them than itis to build barriers that also lock many other people out.andP;  The man atLawrence Berkeley Labs (Cliff Stoll) who stalked the intruder had the rightidea.andP;  However, it seems he fell into his role purely by chance.andP;  It ispremature to institute a network police force, but someone should beexercising a healthy curiosity.andM;Some of these suggestions might have an ominous sound.andP;  Given the choicebetween chaotic networks and one overseen by an all-knowing agency, most ofus would choose the former.andP;  However, just as cities are usually able tonavigate a course between such extremes we should be able to find a way tokeep our networks dynamic and open yet safe for use as well.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
