In Leipzig, thousands of activists held a peaceful rallydemanding free elections now that would give voters a chance toremove the Communists from power. East German state-run televisionsaid up to 50,000 people attended, but an Associated Press reporteron the scene estimated the crowd at 10,000.   The turnout was lower than expected in the southern industrialcity where crowds of 300,000 and more have been protesting forweeks. Many residents apparently decided they would rather shop orsightsee in West Germany than attend today's rally, organized bythe New Forum opposition group.   Elsewhere, more than a million East Germans poured into WestBerlin and West Germany, window-shopping or snacking on bratwurstto celebrate the second weekend of their new-found freedom totravel.   The endorsement of the 28-member Cabinet gave new Premier HansModrow the go-ahead to embark on a reform course that embraces manyprinciples of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroikareform program.   The Cabinet gives 11 seats to non-Communist allies but retainsthe key posts in foreign affairs, defense and economic matters forthe Communists.   There were five ``no'' votes and six abstentions in the500-member People's Chamber in the Cabinet vote broadcast live ontelevision.   The committee set up by Parliament will study possibleconstitutional changes. Manfred Gerlach, president of the LiberalDemocratic Party, has said he will ask for a change that wouldremove Article 1 that guarantees the Communists' leading role.Another panel was set up to prepare an election law. The Communistleadership has promised free balloting but has not set a date.   Parliament also formed a committee to investigate cases ofcorruption, personal enrichment and abuse of power.   The moves were the latest in a series of recent momentouschanges that have rewritten the politics of East Germany.   They include massive pro-democracy protests, the replacement ofhard-line Communist Party leader Erich Honecker with Egon Krenz,the opening of the Berlin Wall and Parliament's election of thereform-minded Modrow.   Almost half of the 1.2 million East Germans who came West lateFriday were in West Berlin, city officials said.   Although the city was busier than usual, there was little of thetumultuous street party atmosphere that engulfed the western sectora week ago.   ``We'd like to stay all night and make a party,'' said EastBerliner Ellen Eversberg, 18. ``But already we can see a party herecosts a lot of money.''   The official ADN news agency reported that some trains carryingpassengers from East to West Berlin were ``recklessly stormed'' byimpatient travelers who filled the cars two or three times overcapacity.   ADN said the moving trains had to be slowed for safety reasons,and 72 additional trains were put into service to ease the crush.   Marked-down merchandise and makeshift stands hawking cheapleather handcrafts cluttered the normally stylish Kurfuerstendammboulevard today as businesses changed gears to meet demands fromvisiting East Germans.   The city's main shopping boulevard is usually the scene of poshpromenades, with decked-out couples poring over designer windowdisplays and walking well-groomed pets.   Portable toilets were set out at main intersections for thethrongs of shoppers, who combed stores and sidewalk booths forbargains that could pay for at least in part with their $55handouts from Bonn.   The West German government gives the ``welcome money'' to eachEast German visitor once a year as a gift that gives them a chanceto sample Western wares.   Tables and sales bins bearing barettes, pins, bracelets andplastic watches crowded the broad sidewalks that were teeming withshoppers.   After East Germany's abrupt decision on Nov. 9 to let itscitizens travel freely, 1.3 million East Germans rushed to WestBerlin, a city already crowded with 2 million residents. EastGerman officials punched new crossings in the Berlin Wall toaccommodate the crunch.   American troops at the U.S. Army base at Mariendorf in WestBerlin set up a soup kitchen, at the request of the West Germanauthorities, to feed 1,400 East German families who want to stay inthe West.   Most of the East Germans who visit over the weekend will returnhome, but government reception centers were prepared for those whowill not go back.   In his first speech to Parliament since becoming premier Monday,Modrow on Friday outlined a mix of free enterprise and socialistplanning to rescue East Germany from its economic morass. Modrowcalled for more formal relations with West Germany, which hasoffered aid to East Germany in return for its conversion to a moremarket-oriented economy.   ``We are waiting now for the other side to respond,'' Modrowtold the legislators in his two-hours speech.   West German officials were cautious, saying the proposal forgreater cooperation lacked details.   In his call for improving relations with West Germany, thepremier said the two countries could act on security, environmentalprotection and other matters of common interest. But he drew a longround of applause when he denounced reunification of the twoGermanies.   Modrow's recovery plan appears to follow the course taken by theSoviets over the past four years, which allows only limited privateenterprise. His address was approved unanimously by Parliament.</TEXT></DOC>
