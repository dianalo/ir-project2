The OPEC development came late in the European oil-trading day and had little impact on spot markets for North Sea Brent crude. But prices appeared to pick up late in the day, according to Dow Jones International Petroleum Report, with Brent for August delivery settling at about $14.45 a barrel, down from $15.05 late Friday.    In U.S. futures trading, West Texas Intermediate crude opened substantially lower because of the weak Brent market. The benchmark U.S. crude then rallied smartly in heavy trading on news of the possible meeting of the OPEC committee, only to retreat again on skepticism that it would take place. Prices were rising again late in the day, but the U.S. benchmark crude closed, nevertheless, at the year's low of $14.78 a barrel, down 68 cents from Friday.    &quot;Traders are very skeptical on OPEC getting anything together,&quot; said Eric Bolling of Edge Trading Corp., but the possibility of a meeting still &quot;has a tendency to firm prices.&quot;    The meeting of OPEC's price-monitoring committee of five leading oil ministers may -- or may not -- take place about the middle of August. But the mere prospect of such a meeting was enough to slow yesterday's decline in oil prices, especially combined with word from OPEC that Subroto, the former Indonesian oil minister who became OPEC secretary-general this month, will visit the president of the United Arab Emirates. The Emirates recently have received wide publicity for openly abandoning the country's OPEC output quota.    Both developments were announced by OPEC's Vienna headquarters yesterday, immediately after Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister and president of OPEC, met with Mr. Subroto to welcome him officially as secretary-general, a position that had been vacant for several years because of problems related to the war between Iraq and Iran, two of the cartel's 13 member nations.    OPEC has been producing more than 18.5 million barrels a day, some 500,000 barrels a day above indicated demand for its crude. As a result, oil prices have been on a slide for several weeks. That was interrupted last week by the explosion at a North Sea oil platform and by rumors OPEC would call another meeting. Even so, a recent report by Washington-based Petroleum Finance Co. attached &quot;a 30% probability to futures prices of West Texas Intermediate dropping to the $11-$12 per barrel range sometime during the third quarter.&quot;    Chief contributors to OPEC's overproduction are Iraq, which remains outside the quota system because of its war with Iran, and the United Arab Emirates. The latter not only has reneged on its OPEC quota but also is moving to produce 500,000 barrels a day more, for a targeted total output of 1.5 million barrels a day.    Some industry analysts interpreted the planned Subroto visit as a new type of &quot;peer&quot; pressure on the Emirates from others in OPEC. But OPEC announced only that Mr. Subroto &quot;will soon fly&quot; to the Emirates &quot;to deliver a message to {Emirates} President Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nayyam concerning the current oil market situation.&quot; Also, &quot;pending the result&quot; of the visit, the OPEC news agency reported, &quot;a meeting of the price committee may take place.&quot;    OPEC's price monitoring committee consists of the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Algeria, Indonesia and Nigeria. They are responsible for monitoring world oil prices and can, if they deem necessary, recommend a course of action for OPEC, including the calling of a full ministerial meeting.    A Venezuelan government official confirmed yesterday that all five members of the price monitoring committee had agreed to their meeting. &quot;Our objective is to see prices strengthen,&quot; he said. But he said he doesn't know whether this will lead to an emergency meeting of all the oil ministers, as called for by Ecuador and some other OPEC nations hard hit by the decline in oil prices.    Dates of the Subroto trip to the Emirates and the possible price committee meeting weren't disclosed. But senior OPEC officials said Mr. Subroto is expected to go to the Emirates as early as this weekend. The meeting of the price-monitoring committee probably would be the first or second week of August to avoid conflict with the Hajj, the Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, taking place in late July. </TEXT></DOC>
