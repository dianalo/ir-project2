The principle is presentedof the detection of atmospheric ions using an ionometer, and the ratioof positive and negative ions is discussed. The knowledge has been usedfor the evaluation of ion quality of air in offices, industrial areas,in caves, etc. An artificial ion source is recommended for reducing theion deficit in offices. The differences in published values are discussed.(E.S.). 4 figs., 2 tabs., 15 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
