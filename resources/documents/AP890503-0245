It isn't hard to understand why. Home-equity loans serve as aconvenient way to tap one of the nation's greatest pools of wealth.   On top of that, changes in the laws have given them a specialtax status. In contrast to most other types of consumer borrowing,interest paid on the typical home-equity loan remains fullydeductible, within specified limits.   But with all their advantages, home-equity loans also carry withthem more potential risks and drawbacks than many people realize,financial advisers say.   As Albert Ellentuck at the accounting firm of Laventhol andamp;Horwath puts it: ``Home-equity loan agreements, like cigarettepackages, should carry a consumer warning in large type _ `Caution!This loan could be hazardous to your financial health.'''   The biggest pitfall in home-equity borrowing _ the risk oflosing your house if you can't keep up with payments _ has beenwidely publicized, and deservedly so.   This point alone makes a powerful case against using home-equitycredit for any frivolous or short-term purpose, such as a vacationor a shopping spree.   Ideally, the money borrowed should finance an asset with a vaueat least as great as the total cost of the loan, and expected tolast at least as long as the term of the loan.   The most obvious example of this kind of asset would beimprovements to the property itself.   ``Say you take out a 10-year home equity loan to finance a newcar,'' Ellentuck observes.   ``The car is gone long before you've paid off your loan. Bystretching the debt over so long a period, you're just racking uphuge interest charges.''   This may seem to be plain common sense. But Ellentuck points outthat there are some other possible perils with home-equity loansthat aren't so readily apparent.   Home-equity credit often is touted as an inexpensive way toborrow, since lenders generally charge lower interest rates onloans backed by such solid collateral.   Although that may be true in principle, Ellentuck says,appraisal costs, other up-front charges and annual account feesmake some equity loans a lot more costly than the stated interestrate suggests.   Watch out in particular, he counsels, for deals withbargain-basement ``teaser'' interest rates that can be raisedsharply just a few months after the loan is made.   In many home-equity deals, borrowers are allowed to pay onlyinterest charges for a period of time without repaying any of theprincipal.   Whatever advantages that may afford, Ellentuck points out, itmakes a loan more expensive than a conventional arrangement inwhich payments cover both interest and part of the principal.That's because the balance due remains at its original, high level.   Furthermore, such a setup typically leaves you faced with a``balloon'' payment at the end of the loan's term, which may or maynot be easy to finance at that time.   ``If you're seriously considering a home equity loan, shoparound,'' Ellentuck concludes.   ``Look for a loan that imposes no points on closing, offers alow cap on the increase in your variable interest rate, and chargesannual fees of $20 or less.''
