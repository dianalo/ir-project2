In 1991, he predicted, 58,000 will leave the colony.   Most of those leaving are members of Hong Kong'swell-educated middle class, who have turned this1,063-square-kilometer patch of islands and peninsula on thesouthern Chinese coast into an economic powerhouse. Theirdeparture has sparked fears of economic and social problemsin Hong Kong once China resumes control of the territory in1997.   Interest in emigration has skyrocketed since China crackeddown on a movement for freedom in Beijing in June of lastyear. The crackdown convinced many in the territory thatChina could easily break its promise to maintain the colony'sfreewheeling economic and social system for 50 years.   London's refusal to give its colonial subjects the rightto live in Britain had a role in stimulating emigration.</TEXT></DOC>
