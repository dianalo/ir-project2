Police said nine people were killed and 26 wounded in the twoattacks.   In Beirut, the Lebanese army defused a car rigged with 165pounds of explosives near Prime Minister Salim Hoss' office 30minutes before it was set to go off, police said.   ``A bloodbath has been averted,'' said a police spokesman. Hoss,a Sunni Moslem, was at home five blocks away when the bomb wasdiscovered and did not appear to be the target, the spokesman saidon condition of anonymity.   Police said at least seven people were killed and 23 wounded inthe five-minute air raid that wrecked the two-story Communist Partyheadquarters in the coastal town of Rmeile, 20 miles south of thecapital.   The building took at least two direct rocket hits as six PhantomF-4 fighter-bombers attacked it. Rescuers searched the wreckage formore victims late Tuesday. Reporters heard moans and screams frombeneath the debris.   Among those killed was Communist commander codenamed Abu Rabei,who just before his death screamed for his 22-year-old daughter,still buried in the ruins.   In Jerusalem, the Israeli military command said its warplanesreturned to their bases. It said the Communists had organized andlaunched attacks on Israeli forces and the South Lebanon Army, anIsraeli-backed Lebanese militia.   Police said two other Communist guerrillas were killed and threewounded as Israeli paratroopers earlier destroyed the Communistbase at Nabi Safi, in the foothills of Mount Hermon 7{ miles northof the zone Israel occupies in south Lebanon.   The two-hour assault was the Israeli army's heaviest groundoperation in Lebanon since an assault against the Syrian-backedPopular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command Dec.9, 1988.   The attack force of 100 commandos advanced from the borderenclave, occupied by Israel since 1982, in four tanks and eightarmored personnel carriers behind a massive artillery barrage,police reported.   The attackers stormed through the villages of Kfar Meshki andLebbaya in the eastern Bekaa Valley after two helicopter gunshipsblasted the villages with eight rockets, destroying many houses,the spokesman said.   Forty other paratroopers were then dropped by helicopters inNabi Safa, where they blew up the Communists' two-story commandpost, the spokesman added.   The Israeli military said their side suffered no casualties. Buta Communist Party statement in Beirut said ``the enemy sufferedheavy losses in lives and ammunition at the hands of our heroes whofought hand-to-hand to repulse the attack.''   The villages have long been used by the Communists and otherleftist Lebanese and Palestinian guerrilla factions allied withSyria to attack the Israeli-held zone.   Also Tuesday, police said heavy artillery duels raged Tuesday insouth Lebanon about 15 miles west of Nabi Safa between theIranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the Syrian-alliedAmal.   The two militias also clashed with machine guns androcket-propelled grenades in the Shiite slums of Hay el-Lija inwest Beirut after midday. There were no reports of casualties inBeirut.   Police have reported at least 38 people killed and 150 woundedin the south since Saturday in a renewed power struggle between therival groups for control of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, thecountry's largest sect.</TEXT></DOC>
