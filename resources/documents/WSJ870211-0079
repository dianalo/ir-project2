Mr. Bracher's departure consolidates the position of Mr. Funaro, whose resignation had also been rumored. But it appears likely to create a policy vacuum while Brazil is in the midst of an economic crisis and is in crucial discussions on the rescheduling of its $108 billion foreign debt. Mr. Bracher began the debt negotiations with international bankers last month.    Mr. Bracher, the first prominent casualty of the collapse of Brazil's Cruzado anti-inflation plan, will be succeeded by Francisco Roberto Gros, a director of the National Bank of Economic and Social Development and an ally of Mr. Funaro.    &quot;Bracher told me his reasons for resigning, I understood and I accepted,&quot; Mr. Funaro said.    Tensions between Mr. Funaro and Mr. Bracher have grown steadily since last November. The central bank was angered then by follow-up measures to the Cruzado plan that failed to slow runaway consumer demand, which boosted imports and hurt the country's trade balance and eroded its reserves.    More recently, they have clashed over the central bank's policy of high interest rates and over what stance Brazil should adopt toward the International Monetary Fund in debt talks.    Mr. Bracher has argued that interest rates -- currently running at more than 600% annually -- can't be lowered because they merely reflect inflationary expectations. In an interview with state television after his resignation, he warned that to relax monetary policy would &quot;provoke a catastrophe.&quot; But the Finance Ministry has accused the bank of fueling inflation and inviting a recession by keeping rates so high.    It thus seems likely that Mr. Gros will try to coax interest rates lower during the next few months.    Regarding the IMF, an austerity program imposed by the fund would be unacceptable to Mr. Funaro. But under Mr. Bracher, the central bank's view was less rigid. Mr. Funaro's line now seems certain to prevail.    Mr. Bracher's departure comes as inflation appears headed out of control. Analysts say consumer prices are likely to climb by more than 20% this month from January, after an estimated 15% increase last month.    Meanwhile, Brazil's slumping trade performance has failed to pick up, and there are widespread reports that the January figure will show a deficit.    In another sign of its economic problems, Brazil last week lifted a year-old price freeze that had distorted the economy and had been increasingly ignored in the marketplace. Lifting the freeze, which caused immediate price rises of between 30% and 40% for many goods, amounted to the government's first formal recognition of the collapse of its Cruzado plan.    The onus will now be on Mr. Funaro, who is a close friend of President Jose Sarney, to reverse Brazil's economic slump. Some officials say he is preparing a new and shorter price freeze to be applied after current price distortions have been eliminated. But if this, or other policies, is unsuccessful, pressure for Mr. Funaro's departure will likely be overwhelming.    Mr. Bracher, a lawyer who had headed the central bank since August 1985, was widely respected among the economists who devised the Cruzado plan. They believe that if his emphasis on tighter monetary policy and controlling government spending had been heeded earlier, the plan's wage-and-price freeze would have found the necessary support to control inflation. But both President Sarney and Mr. Funaro increasingly rejected Mr. Bracher's advice.    His resignation seems likely to slow the pace of debt talks, as Mr. Gros takes up the negotiations. With Brazilian economic policy in such turmoil, many bankers now believe that a multiyear rescheduling is unlikely and that a one-year accord is the best that can be hoped for.    However, Mr. Bracher said that Mr. Gros, a 42-year-old Princeton and Columbia University economics graduate, would be well-equipped to take over negotiations with Brazil's creditors. Mr. Gros worked for more than 20 years in private banks. In 1972, he joined the international section of Kidder Peabody andamp; Co. in New York, where he worked for three years.    Mr. Bracher's departure should give more cohesion to an administration that has recently been paralyzed by internal conflict. And the need for cohesive economic direction is urgent for Brazil, because on its current course the nation could jeopardize its recent rescheduling of $4.1 billion in foreign debt.    That debt pact -- which opened the door for the current talks with commercial banks -- was reached with the Paris Club, an informal committee comprising representatives of creditor governments. The nations said they would reconsider the accord if Brazil doesn't receive a &quot;favorable report&quot; from the IMF during annual consultations next July on steps the nation is taking to deal with its balance-of-payments problems.    A favorable IMF reaction would be less likely if Brazil can't stanch inflation and mend its internal rifts sufficiently to tackle its economic problems. </TEXT></DOC>
