The evolution of the energy system and the dynamicsof natural gas are described first. With this historical perspective,the future developments likely to lead to the separation of the oil andgas industry, and of oil and methane technologies are then outlined.In a number of examples analyzed in this chapter, it is shown that thegrowth and senescence of energy technologies can be described as a regularprocess with logistic secular trends. The dynamics of primary energysubstitution in the world and most of the countries and regions analyzedto date indicate that natural gas could become the energy source of choiceduring the coming decades. This transition from oil to gas as the dominantsource of energy is considered at different stages of the energy systemfrom exploration and production to energy consumption and end-use. Throughoutthe energy system, there are clear indications that natural gas technologies(e.g., exploration and transport) are still in the growth phase, whereasoil technologies are apparently close to saturation. Most of the examplesanalyzed here are from the USA, primarily because of the US leadershipin natural gas use and technologies in the past, and because of dataavailability. 20 figs., 35 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
