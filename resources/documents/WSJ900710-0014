Thecompany said its world-wide orders for athletic footwear andapparel scheduled for delivery between June and November 1990are 42% higher in dollars compared to the same period lastyear.

International salescomprise only a little more than 20% of the company'sbusiness currently, she says.   &quot;Basketball is the fastest growing sport in Europe,&quot; Ms.Esquivel says, giving Nike an opportunity to exercise one ofits strongest suits there. Meanwhile, Nike is pursuing otherEuropean sports markets such as soccer, she says.   &quot;All that put together will continue to give Nike atremendous edge overseas,&quot; says Ms. Esquivel. She expects thecompany's earnings to grow 20% annually for the next threeyears. Yesterday, Ms. Esquivel raised her estimate for Nike'sfiscal 1991 profit to $7.80 a share from her earlier estimateof $7.50 a share.   Eager investors may get a buying opportunity soon, shesays.
