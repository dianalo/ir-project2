That means election coverage starts at 8 p.m. local time in eachzone as the polls close, unlike the U.S. system where the Pacificcoast receives network coverage while voting continues.   ``We've got six time zones; that's why we've got to be verycautious,'' said Jacques Mackay of the federal Elections Canadaagency. ``Of course, it's very difficult today in the age ofcomunications to limit it _ but it's still done.''   Mackay said in a telephone interview from Ottawa that the lawprohibits broadcasters from talking about election results whilepolls remain open in any particular time zone.   ``It's still possible to phone somebody in the East and say,`What's going on?''' Bazay said.   The majority of Canada's population lives in Quebec and Ontario,which are on Eastern Standard Time. Those two provinces account for10.7 million of the 17.5 million voters registered for Monday'selection and 174 of the 295 seats in the House of Commons.   That leads to complaints from those who live farther west,especially British Columbia, which has 32 seats, where polls closethree hours later.   ``It's very simple,'' David Bazay, executive producer of thepublic Canadian Broadcasting Corp.'s network news, said when askedto explain the system. ``We do it every day as a matter of course.Our national news basically has five editions.''   Election programming for Newfoundland, where polls close at 6:30p.m. EST, can start in the central studio in Toronto and bebroadcast regionally. The Atlantic Coast of Nova Scotia, NewBrunswick and Prince Edward Island is added an hour later, thenQuebec and Ontario.   ``We have a network. We can put the entire national networktogether, or parts of it together,'' Bazay said. ``As the pollsclose across the country, we simply put on election coverage. ...It's not complicated at all.''   The private Canadian TV network also was planning coveragestarting at 8 p.m. local time. Global was not starting its coverageuntil about 10:15 p.m., after the conclusion of a National HockeyLeague game between St. Louis and Toronto.   Satellite and cable television are increasingly available toCanadian households. Pierre Pontbriand, spokesman for the CanadianRadio and Television Commission, said it was the responsibility ofeach satellite and cable licensee to comply with the election law.</TEXT></DOC>
