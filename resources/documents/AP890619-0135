During his long-delayed visit, originally scheduled for lastfall, Rafsanjani is expected to sign major long-term economicagreements that will strengthen Tehran's increasing ties with hiscountry's northern neighbor and the communist bloc.   He also is to visit Budapest and Sofia, where he is expected tofinalize 10-year cooperation agreements that will include Hungarianand Bulgarian aid in developing Iran's arms industry.   Rafsanjani is the highest-ranking Iranian leader to visit theSoviet capital.   The departure of such a key political figure at a time when Iranis undergoing a transition of power following Ayatollah RuhollahKhomeini's death June 3 underlined the importance Tehran attaches tobolstering relations with Moscow following the August 1988cease-fire in the war with Iraq.   The Soviets have been courting the Iranians for several years,even during the war, when they were Iraq's main arms supplier.   Western sources said the Soviets quietly provided weapons to Iranas well, although not in the same quantities.   ``But Iran, in the long run, is a bigger prize than Iraq, as theAmericans well know,'' said one Western diplomat.   ``Now that Khomeini's gone, the contest for influence in Iran islikely to increase. The Soviets and the East bloc are signingeconomic agreements that are whittling down Western opportunities,''he said on condition of anonymity.   Relations between Moscow and Tehran were strained for years,particularly after the Iranians cracked down on the pro-Moscow TudehParty in 1981.   But once the Soviets began moving out of Afghanistan, Iran'seastern neighbor where it still backs Moslem guerrillas fighting theMarxist Kabul government, relations warmed quickly.   Khomeini sealed the new relationship in January by sending Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev an unprecedented letter praising hispolicies of perestroika and glasnost.   Gorbachev's reply, carried to Iran by Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze, said: ``Conditions are ripe for relations between ourcountries to enter a qualitiatively new stage of cooperation in allfields.''   The Iranians and Soviets have highlighted their expandingeconomic cooperation, but they have said little about what Westernsources say are the burgeoning military links between Tehran and theEast bloc.   The Soviet deputy foreign minister, Yuri Vorontsov, told Iran'sofficial Islamic Republic News Agency last month after visitingTehran: ``There is nothing to limit the cooperation between our twocountries.''   IRNA quoted him as saying: ``We can effectively help each otherand cooperate to solve important problems ... including theenhancement of military forces.''   Tehran's radical Abrar daily said recently: ``There are no majorobstacles in the way of mutual cooperation, especially Sovietparticipation in Iran's reconstruction ... Moscow can help Iran inmany technical and scientific fields.''   Rafsanjani, who is emerging as Iran's strongman followingKhomeini's death, said June 8 he would not be seeking to buy weaponsfrom Moscow.   But Western intelligence officials and analysts have reportedthat Iran, seeking to rebuild its armed forces after a series ofdefeats in the war with Iraq, is desperate to upgrade its depletedair force and armored forces.   Western sources said Iran has signed military cooperationagreements with Czechoslovakia, a major European arms manufacturer,Romania and Yugoslavia for the purchase of hardware ranging fromarmored vehicles to jet fighters.   Although there has been no official confirmation, Iran's deputyforeign minister, Ali Mohammad Besharati, told the Tehran Times lastmonth that Iran soon would buy Soviet weapons and was negotiatingwith other countries to buy advanced fighter-bombers.   He said ``extensive talks'' have been held with Soviet officials,who have been shuttling in and out of Tehran for months, and that``all related issues have been finalized.''   He did not identify the countries with which Iran wasnegotiating. But Western military sources believe the bargainingcenters on Yugoslavia and Romania, both visited by Iranian PresidentAli Khamenei in April.   China, a key arms supplier that Khamenei has also visitedrecently, also figures prominently in Tehran's efforts to build upits military.   A senior U.S. Defense Department source said the Iranians are``putting a lot of emphasis on rebuilding their military; faster,actually, than we really expected. They're talking of spending inthe range of $20 billion over the next four to five years.''</TEXT></DOC>
