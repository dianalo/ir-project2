Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FIN </CO><IN> ERN BNK </IN><TEXT>   Deeply troubled Financial Corp. of America, parent of the U.S.'s second largest thrift, reported a second-quarter loss of $160.5 million and said its thrift unit failed to meet federal liquidity requirements in June and July.    The Irvine, Calif.-based company's loss, which compared with a year-earlier loss of $223.6 million, was caused mostly by a $113.4 million provision for losses on loans and real estate. A year earlier, the loss provision was $164.8 million.    However, Financial Corp.'s operating loss widened in the quarter to $47.8 million from $9.7 million a year earlier. The company said the operating loss was caused by its large amount of assets that don't produce any interest income and by the shrinkage of its mortgage-backed securities portfolio.    Under orders from federal regulators, Financial Corp. reduced its mortgage-backed securities holdings by $2.18 billion, or about 12%, during the first half to $16.07 billion to reduce the risk of rising interest rates.    A net deposit outflow of nearly $979.1 million in the second quarter caused American Savings andamp; Loan Association, Financial Corp.'s main unit, to fail to meet federal liquidity requirements for the first time since 1984. In 1984, American Savings had a record third-quarter deposit outflow of $6.8 billion and failed to meet liquidity requirements for nearly five months.    Federal Home Loan Bank Board rules require thrifts to maintain an average daily balance of liquid assets, such as cash and cash equivalents, equal to 5% of savings deposits and short-term borrowings. American Savings had a liquidity level of 4.1% in June and 3.6% in July.    To increase liquidity, American Savings on July 27 began a program of selling retail certificates of deposit through a group of brokers led by Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. About $145 million of such certificates was sold in the first week of the program, Financial Corp. said. Regulators have approved the sale of as much as $2.5 billion of such certificates.    American Savings has been in violation of the Bank Board's minimum capital requirements since 1984, and the recent violation of liquidity rules isn't likely to result in any additional regulatory action. In March, the Bank Board said it will pay all depositors and general creditors of American Savings andamp; Loan if it takes action against the thrift. Normally, depositors are insured only up to $100,000 each.    During the second quarter, American Savings' negative net worth deepened to $373.4 million from $212 million in the first quarter, meaning that its liabilities exceeded its assets by those amounts. Financial Corp.'s negative net worth deepened to $387 million at June 30 from $226.5 million at March 31.    Financial Corp.'s latest loss isn't likely to affect the current negotiations between the Bank Board and the Robert M. Bass Group of Fort Worth, Texas, which is expected to acquire American Savings with as much as $2.2 billion in federal assistance.    Negotiations between the Bank Board and Bass Group, which is expected to inject $550 million of new capital into American Savings, are expected to be completed by Sept. 1.    It isn't clear whether the Bank Board will provide any compensation to Financial Corp. or its shareholders and debt holders. Because of American Savings' insolvency, the Bank Board can take control of the thrift and transfer it to Bass Group without compensating Financial Corp.    Financial Corp. common closed Friday at 87.5 cents a share, up 6.25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company announced its loss after the close of trading.    In a statement, William J. Popejoy, Financial Corp.'s chairman, said, &quot;At this point, we are concentrating on controlling costs, further building depositor confidence and representing our shareholders' interests in any way that we can.    &quot;We are hopeful that capital relief will come soon and that it will provide the boost needed for us to stop the further financial deterioration&quot; of American Savings.    Financial Corp. said its &quot;lack of profitability&quot; in the second quarter was &quot;influenced by the economic conditions in the oil patch and certain Sun Belt states, which persist in negatively affecting the company's real estate and loans.&quot;    Since Mr. Popejoy and his management team took over in August 1984, after the Bank Board forced out former Chairman Charles W. Knapp, Financial Corp. has added a total of $1.8 billion to its loss reserves. </TEXT></DOC>
