The proposed regulatory changes are a result of the review andanalysis process that have taken place with these organizations and withinthe National Credit Union Administration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>date:</T2> Comments must be received by August 21, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>address:</T2> Send comments to Becky Baker, Secretary, NCUA Board,1776 G Street, NW, Washington, DC 20456. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>for further information contact:</T2> D.

The nature of a credit union's balance sheet has changed dramaticallysince the original reserve procedures were established. At that time, consumerloans made up almost all of a credit union's assets and thus the creditunion made reserve transfers on what were essentially total assets. Atpresent, a substantial part of most credit union's balance sheets is inassets not considered by definition to be risk assets. These items arenot included in the assets that determine minimum statutory reserve goals.Events of recent years have shown, however, that substantial losses canoccur on many of these assets.Accordingly, the NCUA Board made the decision to review the issues involvingrisk assets and reserve requirements. The NCUA Board wanted to ensure consistencybetween credit union reserves against losses and the risk inherent in thecurrent asset structures of credit unions. During the comment period initiatedby the NCUA Board in October 1987, (52 FR 38771, 10/19/87) the NCUA Boardreceived comments that made four general points:a. The definition of risk assets could be improved, particularly in thearea of long-term assets;b. No change should be made to the definition that would adversely affectcredit unions;c. Credit unions involved with riskier undertakings should be requiredto reserve at a higher rate; andd. Statute and regulation needs improvement.This initial comment period clearly indicated to the NCUA Board that thisissue needed further review and in April 1988, the NCUA Board recommendedthat a review be made on the statute, regulation and accounting proceduresinvolving reserves, risk assets and reserve transfers. It also directedNCUA to work with the credit union industry to develop a systematic, cohesiveapproach to the broad issue of the capital position of credit unions.Immediately after this decision was made by the NCUA Board, a Credit UnionReserves Study Commission was formed in cooperation with the credit uniontrade organizations and state regulatory authorities. The Commission, afterseveral months of hard work, decided that the issue of redefining riskassets and reserve requirements needed to be presented to credit unionsagain, not for a vote, but as survey to solicit their view on several issues.The survey asked for their opinion on:a. Keeping the reserve requirements as they are now;b. Adding ``long-term'' investments to the current definition of ``riskassets'';c. Replacing the current system of reserving with a ``net capital contribution''requirement based on the credit union's capital to asset ratio. ``Net capitalcontribution'' would be defined as the net change in its capital (all reservesand undivided earnings) from one accounting period to the next, net ofnon-operating gains or losses.The responses were mixed, with strong support for almost every combination.The ``make no change'' position had the strongest response, but many ofthe narrative comments with the ``make no change'' position seemed to indicatemodest changes were necessary. The Commission published its findings inFebruary 1989 and made two recommendations.The first recommendation is that the credit union movement should seeklegislative and regulatory changes to replace the current system of requiredtransfers to regular reserves with a system of required net capital contributions.In addition, they recommended that regulatory agencies consider makingseveral regulation changes which would change the current required reservetransfer system.After review of the regulations, the NCUA Board is proposing the followingchanges to the National Credit Union Administration Rules and Regulations:Section 700.1(j) DefinitionsAdd to the list of assets that will be included as part of risk assetsfor the purpose of determining the reserves required by Section 116 ofthe Federal Credit Union Act:(1) Ownership of fixed assets, as defined by andSection;701.36 of the NCUARules and Regulations, is excess of 5 percent of total shares and retainedearnings; (Proposed andSection;700.1(k)(11)) and(2) Investments with a remaining maturity over 3 years that are not carriedat the lower of cost or market or are not marked to market value monthly.(Proposed andSection;700.1 (j) and (k)(16)).Section 702.2 Regular Reservea. That the Allowance for Investment Losses be included with the Allowancefor Loan Losses and Regular Reserve in determining the applicable percentageof gross income to be transferred to the Regular Reserve. (Proposed andSection;702.2(a))b. Charges to the Regular Reserve for losses other than loan losses mustbe approved by the Regional Director. (Proposed andSection; 702.2(c))Section 702.3 Full and Fair DisclosureAdd a provision that the maintenance of a valuation allowance for investmentsand other losses does not eliminate the requirement for transferring apercentage of gross income before the payment of each dividend to the RegularReserve as required by Section 116 of the Federal Credit Union Act. (ProposedandSection; 702.3(c)(1))<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Regulatory Flexibility ActThe NCUA Board has determined and certified that the proposed amendment,if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small credit unions (primarily those under $1 million in assets).Accordingly, the NCUA Board has determined that a Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis is not required.Paperwork Reduction ActThis proposed rule, if adopted, will impose the requirement that any federallyinsured credit union wanting to make a charge against the Regular Reservefor losses other than loan losses must have the approval of the RegionalDirector. This requirement will be submitted to the Office of Managementand Budget for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act. Written commentson this rule should be forwarded directly to the OMB Desk Officer indicatedbelow at the following address: OMB Reports Management Branch, New ExecutiveOffice Building, Room 3208, Washington, DC 20530, ATTN: Jerry Waxman.Executive Order 12612The NCUA Board has considered the fact that this proposed rule will affectfederally insured state-chartered credit unions (FISCUs) in the determinationof transfers to reserves. It does not impose any additional cost or burdenon the states, nor does it affect the states' ability to discharge traditionalstate government functions. The benefits provided and protection affordedby the NCUSIF is the same for FISCUs as it is for federal credit unions.It is protection afforded through a federal system and the responsibilityfor administering that system lies with the NCUA Board. All federally insuredcredit unions, whether federal or state chartered, will be subject to thesame requirements. The requirement for all federally insured credit unionsare the same, i.e., reserve transfers in accordance with section 116 ofthe Federal Credit Union Act. The acts and requirements subject to thisproposed rule have implications for the entire federally insured creditunion system and its insurer and are not unique to only one type of charter.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>12 CFR Part 700Credit unions, Risk assets, Reserve requirements.12 CFR Part 702Credit unions, Regular Reserve charges, Full and fair disclosure.By the National Credit Union Administration Board on May 11, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="6">Becky Baker,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary of the Board.</ITAG>Accordingly, NCUA proposes to amend its regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 700_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
