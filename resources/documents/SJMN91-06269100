The porch extends over a crawl space. I've tried everyleading brand of paint and primer. Any suggestions?;   A Improper preparationprobably can be eliminated as a probable cause, because it appears you aretaking the right steps, including scraping off loose paint, using a primer onbare wood and using good-quality products.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Peninsula Home  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PEELING MAKES A PAINT JOB LESS APPEALING  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Repairs  </MEMO><TEXT>     That leaves moisture as a leading suspect. Moisture can destroy a prettypaint job. When paint peels from window frames and sills, for example, itoften is because moisture is getting into the wood through uncaulked orunflashed joints.;   In this case, I suspect moisture is rising from theground under the porch and penetrating the wood, eventually pushing the paintfilm off. Cover the ground or slab under the porch with a layer of rollroofing (tarpaper) or heavy plastic sheeting, overlapping seams and weightingthe edges with bricks or boards. Also, make sure the crawl space is wellventilated at both ends.;   After you take these moisture-reducing measures, Isuggest you scrape off all loose paint and let the wood go unpainted forseveral weeks to help it dry out. Use an exterior-grade primer/sealer on allbare wood and finish with a porch-and-floor paint. If possible, also applyprimer/sealer to the underside of the boards, especially under areas wherepeeling has been heavy.;   Q A cooking accident recently caused our apartmentto fill with smoke. We have two battery-operated smoke detectors, but neithergave an alarm. We tested the detectors after this incident, and they seemedOK. What's wrong?;   A If you gave the detectors the usual push-button test,you probably tested only the batteries, not the sensitivity. Try testing withsome smoke from a candle or cigarette. If the detectors don't work or havepoor sensitivity, replace them. Also, the detectors might be poorly located.Double-check to make sure they are in positions where smoke from likely firesources will reach them quickly.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  GENE AUSTIN, Knight-Ridder Newspapers  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/Am  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910925  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  346  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, September 25, 199100269100,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
