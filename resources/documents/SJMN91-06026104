A lot of Arab people are coming in and saying they want to listen tothe Arab side of the war.&quot;;    John Talley of Talley Electronics, a Haywardelectronics distributor, said that although he expects the new interest inshortwave to end as soon as the fighting does, he nonetheless has hisfactories in Taiwan adding shifts to meet the new demand.;    Shortwavetransmissions travel around the world by repeatedly bouncing at angles betweenthe Earth's surface and the ionosphere. Most countries sponsor shortwave radiobroadcasts, which range in quality from crude propaganda machines to highlyrespected news organizations like the BBC.;    Iraq has Radio Baghdad -- whichlisteners say now has a much-weakened signal, presumably because alliedbombing has knocked out so many power transmitters.;    Not for the casuallistener;  Most shortwave radios cost between $50 and $250, though high-endmachines can cost several thousand dollars.;    But those hobbyists whoseinterest in shortwave predates the current war say that people who buy a unitand expect to casually sit back and listen will probably be disappointed.Transmissions are often intermittent, their quality is unpredictable and eventhe best signals are often full of static and interference.;    &quot;There are alot of factors that will influence what you hear, such as the weather, yourlocation, the time of day or how high up you are,&quot; said Mike Curotto, ahobbyist from San Francisco. &quot;It's like fishing. You have to be patient.&quot;;   One tip: Get a good antenna. &quot;You can have a $5 radio and pick up wonderfulthings if you also have a $500 antenna,&quot; said Herman W. Frisch of San Jose,president of the Bay Area Scanner Enthusiasts Club. &quot;But if you have a $500radio and a $5 antenna, you're in trouble.&quot;;    National radio stationspublish their schedules and their frequencies, and, because they usually sendout strong signals, they are relatively easy to pick up. Not so for militarytransmissions, which can come at any time on any of thousands of frequencies,and which often require an advanced knowledge of shortwave techniques todetect.;    Roaming the dials;  Still, hobbyists who specialize in militarychannels say the endeavor is uniquely thrilling, and that they have spent alltheir free time in the last week at their sets roaming the dials in search ofbattle chatter.;    Heightchew taped the outbreak of the fighting, when thedead-quiet military channels suddenly erupted in ground-to-air communications.He said he also regularly hears Scud alerts, as well as AWACS controllers.;   &quot;The military doesn't like to use scrambling because it sounds like they areall talking out of (a) tin can,&quot; he said. &quot;And sometimes, it's technicallyvery difficult for them to do so. They won't use a scrambler unless they feelit is a situation of total security.&quot;;    Heightchew said, though, that evenunscrambled communications are spoken in a special code, so that while casuallisteners know what words are being said, they don't know what message isbeing transmitted.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LEE GOMES, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910126  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  20A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  713  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday January 26, 199100026104,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
