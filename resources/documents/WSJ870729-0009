StevensStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP CANDA FREST JAPANPRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><TEXT>   The dollar inched lower against most other major currencies in what traders described as one of the dullest trading days so far this year.    Vacation absences at trading desks and a lack of market-moving news kept volume to a minimum and limited the dollar's movement.    Although the U.S. currency weakened slightly, it remained well above its lows for the year. Traders said it appears well supported by technical and political factors for the time being. Next week's scheduled auction of one-year Treasury bills also is expected to attract Japanese investor interest, which would further underpin the dollar for the near term.    However, the lackluster performance of the U.S. economy dims any hope that the dollar might make a sustained show of strength much beyond the end of summer, many traders say.    &quot;These are technical highs for the dollar, not fundamental highs,&quot; Ronald L. Sapiro, vice president and chief dealer at Continental Illinois National Bank andamp; Trust Co., Chicago, said.    With the summer slowdown gripping the foreign-exchange market, some dealers said they prefer to avoid taking large positions until the normal level of liquidity returns in September. A relatively large order amid such thin trading, they said, could easily move the market against a fundamentally sound position.    Because of the lack of liquidity, bank dealers said they were only processing occasional orders from corporate clients yesterday and staying out of the usually active area of interbank trading for their own accounts.    Against the West German mark, the dollar moved in a narrow range from 1.8600 in Asian trading to 1.8537 in New York. In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8551 marks, barely lower than 1.8554 late Monday. It also eased to 150.45 Japanese yen from 150.63.    The dollar was quoted at 150.05 yen in early Tokyo trading today.    The dollar's strengthening early this summer created a base of support for it, according to technical analysts who chart exchange-rate movements to predict the next moves. Traders also see political support for the dollar stemming from agreements between the U.S. and its major allies to maintain exchange-rate stability.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery climbed $2.80 an ounce to $456.50 in heavy trading. Estimated volume was 5.8 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $457.50 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Tuesday, July 28, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
