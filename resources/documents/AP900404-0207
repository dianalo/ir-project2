The negotiations, aimed at making broad structural reforms inthe economies of both the United States and Japan, began Mondaywith the arrival of a 64-member delegation from Japan.   While both sides are insisting that progress is being made, thetalks had originally been scheduled to conclude on Tuesday.However, negotiators met for a third day of closed-door bargainingat the State Department. Talks on both Monday and Tuesday went lateinto the night.   Hills denied that the lengthy negotiations indicated unexpectedroadblocks had developed.   ``There is no deadlock. We are making progress,'' she toldreporters following a speech to the National Association ofManufacturing. ``We want to get it done.''   Hills told officials of the big industry lobbying group that themarket-opening moves being proposed by the American side were inthe self-interest of Japanese consumers, who currently pay thehighest prices in the industrial world for many products.   As she has done in the past, she said that without tradeconcessions on the part of the Japanese to correct the hugeU.S.-Japan trade imbalance, there would be growing pressure in thiscountry to retaliate by raising the cost of Japanese products.   ``If the Japanese do not open up the second largest market inthe world, there will be enormous political pressure,'' she toldthe manufacturing officials.   President Bush was scheduled to meet today with formerambassador to Washington Nobuo Matsunaga, who was dispatched toWashington as the personal emissary of Japanese Prime MinisterToshiki, who has made resolution of U.S.-Japan trade frictions atop priority of his government.   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that ``we seem tohave made good progress'' on trade disputes involvingsupercomputers and satellites in the two-and-a-half days of talkswith Japan.   ``We still have differences, we still have some difficult issuesto resolve. But at least we feel that a good start's been made,''Fitzwater said.   After months of no progress with Japan on trade, there have beenthree agreements reached in the past 10 days _ on opening Japanesemarkets for sale of American-made telecommunications products,supercomputers and satellites. The satellite agreement wasannounced late Tuesday.   Even with the flurry of new agreements, American businessleaders urged caution, noting that the Japanese over the pastdecade have prepared a variety of trade packages which have notproduced the promised results. America's deficit with Japan totaled$49 billion last year, close to half of the total $109 billiontrade imbalance.   ``I still think it is up in the air whether the trade talks willyield any meaningful results,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, president ofthe National Association of Manufacturers, which was to receive aprogress report today on trade negotiations from U.S. TradeRepresentative Carla Hills.   The Bush administration last July launched discussions withJapan aimed at removing broad structural barriers in both theUnited States and Japan that were viewed as primary reasons for thetrade imbalance.   Under the format for the talks, known as the StructuralImpediments Initiative, both sides have presented their own list ofthe economic failings they would like to see corrected in the othercountry.   The United States has pushed for changes in Japan that wouldexpand opportunities for U.S. and other foreign firms to provideproducts and services, arguing that such proposals were in theself-interest of the Japanese because they would lower consumercosts.   Japan has targeted various U.S. failings that hurt America'sability to compete internationally. The Japanese would like to seemore done by U.S. officials to lower the budget deficit, improvethe educational system and get U.S. businesses to focus onlong-term goals rather than quick profits.   Negotiators hope to have an interim progress report completed bymid-April with a final report on structural barriers finished inJuly.</TEXT></DOC>
