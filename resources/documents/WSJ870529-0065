The insured deposits held by the failed bank, which had assets of $27.5 million, were transferred by the FDIC to Texas Capital Bank-Westwood, also in Houston, because the agency received no bids for the purchase of the closed bank.    Texas National's office won't reopen. Depositors are to have access to their funds at Texas Capital's office beginning today.    Texas National held $26.7 million in 1,200 deposit accounts, including $327,000 in 32 accounts that exceeded the federal deposit insurance limit of $100,000 for each depositor. Uninsured depositors will share proportionately with the FDIC in the proceeds from the liquidation of the failed bank's assets.    Texas National was the nation's 82nd bank to fail this year and the 27th in Texas, breaking the record 26 failures last year. </TEXT></DOC>
