The Passive Integrated Tag Gun actually is a pistol-shapedsensing unit connected to a computer; it sets off an alarm when itdetects a tiny metal tag placed in the body of a lobster, said gamewarden Mike Castleton.   When a lobster is showered with the invisible but harmless beam,the tag number is recorded and displayed on a monitor. The tags,nearly impossible to detect with the naked eye, give crustaceanssort of an electronic fingerprint.   The device has been used to track migrating fish for severalyears, but was used to catch a poacher of California spiny lobstersfor the first time in early October off the San Diego coast,Castleton said.   It remains to be seen, however, whether the gun will reduce suchillegal catches or just cause poachers to figure out ways to avoiddetection. ``They are forcing us to become more sophisticated,''Castleton said.   ``You catch on to all their tricks after a while when you'veseen the same thing a couple of hundred times. People try to hidelobsters in their clothes, secret compartments in their boats, allover.''   Though its now being used only against sport fishermen,Castleton said he expects the electronic gun eventually to be usedto reduce commercial poaching. Commercial fishermen often complainthat competitors raid their traps.   More dishonest fishermen than ever seem to be plucking lobstersand other fish from Southern California waters, he said. Entiregenerations of lobsters can be wiped out by just a few aggressivepoachers.   California spiny lobsters, which thrive off the San Diego coast,live in crevices and feed at night on fish, algae, eel grass andinvertebrates. Their name is derived from the sharp spines on theirshells. They don't have large pinching claws like their cousins inthe Atlantic Ocean.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Oct. 30</NOTE></DOC>
