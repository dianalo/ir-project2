The decision ends weeks of speculation over the project, which the Navy is operating as a secret program. Although the Navy didn't discuss its selection, Grumman Corp. and Northrop Corp. are known to have teamed up to enter a competing bid for the job. Sources close to the project said the winning bid was substantially lower than the Northrop-Grumman proposal.    The decision was notable in that it leaves out Grumman, long a prime producer of carrier-based aircraft. Moreover it follows another setback for the Bethpage, N.Y.-based company. Last week, the Navy decided to drop the advanced version of Grumman's A-6 attack plane as a budget-cutting step. The advanced tactical aircraft, or ATA, is seen as a replacement for the A-6 that the Navy has relied on for the past decade.    David Smith, aerospace analyst for Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc., said, &quot;It's a signal that they may be on the way out of the aircraft business; they've lost the A-6F and now they're out of the ATA.&quot; The two planes were considered to be the Navy's main aircraft projects for the 1990s and the first decade of the next century. Mr. Smith predicted that Grumman, which will continue producing aircraft for the current fleet, will shift its emphasis to space and electronics work sometime in the 1990s.    To start the ATA program, the Navy awarded McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics a $241,000 contract to begin engineering work on the plane.    In other contracts, units of Martin Marietta Corp. won awards totaling $528.6 million for Titan IV space-launch vehicles for the Air Force, and Hellfire missiles and AH-64 helicopter equipment for the Army.    Units of General Electric Co. received contracts totaling $414.6 million for development of a prototype aircraft engine and support of Atlas space-launch vehicles for the Air Force, tracking of missiles and space objects for the Army, and shipboard communications equipment for the Navy.    Douglas Aircraft Co., a McDonnell Douglas unit, got a $365.7 million Navy contract for preparation for production of the T-45 jet-aircraft training system.    Lockheed Missiles andamp; Space Co., a unit of Lockheed Corp., was issued a $241 million Navy contract for Trident II missile development and production.    LTV Aerospace andamp; Defense Co., a unit of LTV Corp., was selected for a $223.6 million Army contract for battlefield rockets.    General Dynamics also won Air Force contracts totaling $39.7 million for F-16 aircraft improvements and support services.    Southern Air Transport Inc. was issued Air Force contracts totaling $39.6 million for air-transportation services.    Units of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. received contracts totaling $38.9 million for a telephone system for the Army and oceangraphic research for the Navy.    ITT Corp. was awarded a $25.2 million Army contract for electronic equipment.    Units of Raytheon Co. received contracts totaling $25.1 million for NATO Seasparrow missile equipment and radar equipment for the Navy and satellite-terminal equipment for the Air Force.    Rand Corp. won a $19.2 million Air Force contract for technical services.    Pan Am Corp. got an $18.2 million Army contract for flight training services. </TEXT></DOC>
