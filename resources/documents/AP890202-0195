Some havevalidity and sanctions are applied upon those against whom chargesare levied.   ``I was not aware this was a widespread problem,'' he said.   He said he didn't know of the FBI sting operation, nor was heever approached by the agency while he was president of the exchange.   During a two-year undercover FBI investigation, which began inthe last year of Yeutter's tenure and became public last month,federal agents infiltrated the exchange to gather information aboutalleged fraud by brokers.   ``I know no more than what is in the newspapers,'' Yeutter saidof the case.   Yeutter was president of the exchange from 1978 to 1985 when heleft to become U.S. trade representative.   As he was leaving the trade representative job, he was honoredwith a reception Jan. 18 given by the food, tobacco and brewingconglomerate Philip Morris, Inc., to thank him for his aggressivepursuit of foreign markets for tobacco and other products.   Rules of the executive branch forbid officals from acceptinganything of value from those who could be affected by the official'saction. As agriculture secretary, Yeutter would oversee thedepartment whose policies directly affect Philip Morris.   The reception was reported Thursday by The Washington Post, andSen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., questioned Yeutter about a possibleconflict of interest.   ``When Philip Morris suggested that they would like to hold somekind of event in my honor because of all the work we had been doingin the international trade arena ... I could see no conflict ofinterest problems in them doing so because I was fully intending togo back to the private sector,'' said Yeutter.   ``When the event was agreed to, it simply did not ring anyconflict of interest bells,'' he said, noting that it was held nearthe end of Reagan's term. ``You are not going to be causing anyconflicts of interest in the final 24 hours of an administration.''   He said President-elect Bush asked him to be agriculturesecretary after he accepted Philip Morris' invitation.   ``We probably should have reconsidered because of my expectedcontinuation in government,'' Yeutter said. ``Frankly, I just didn'tthink about it. We were so busy ... wrapping up all the tradeproblems at USTR and getting ready for the transition into USDA, ittotally disappeared from my attention screen.''   Leahy also asked Yeutter whether receiving over $500,000 indeferred payments from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange while he wasa government official could be construed as a conflict of interest.   Yeutter said the payments were made under a traditional deferredcompensation program and distributed to him in a form advised by histax counsel.   Despite the pointed questions, Yeutter was praised by members ofthe committee and is expected to be confirmed without difficulty.The committee will meet early next week to vote on approval withconfirmation by the full Senate expected shortly thereafter.   As for his new job, Yeutter emphasized throughout the hearingwhat he said was the importance of holding down federal spending inagriculture and finding more foreign markets for American products.   ``We have to find ways to permit American farmers to earn incomefrom the marketplace and depend less on the federal government,'' hesaid.   ``We have had too high a reliance on government by farmers inthis country.''   Other topics on which senators asked Yeutter's opinion and hisresponses were:   _School lunches: ``What will happen if the subsidy is withdrawn?That is a policy I will have to take another look at.''   _Farm Credit: ``If we do our jobs well and the farm economy doesas well as it did this year in the future, then the situation willnot get out of hand.''   _General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT): ``We are notabout to abandon any import constraints in the United States unlessthere is quid pro quo in other countries, giving us exportopportunities. It's a horse trade.''   _Rural Development: ``The push and initiative should come fromlocal areas. We can help coordinate and provide technicalassistance.'' He said the federal government does not have billionsof dollars to put into helping farm communities diversify.   _Subsidies: ``We have to know what the trade-offs are. I neversaid we should do away with (all) subsidies, only with tradelimiting subsidies.''</TEXT></DOC>
