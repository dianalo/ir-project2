Analysts said the expansion is part of Rockwell's effort to increase its automotive business overseas. Europe, where the company has 5,500 employees, is Rockwell's largest market outside the U.S. for auto products. Automotive operations accounted for about $2.15 billion, or 18%, of total sales of $11.95 billion for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1988.    The company, which also has interests in aerospace, electronics and graphics, valued the investment in the new plants at $60 million over two years.    The new European facilities will include a West German assembly plant to supply modular sunroof systems under a new contract with Volkswagenwerke A.G. for the 1992 Golf model. It also said it has a letter of intent to supply sunroof systems for two Mazda models.    The company also plans a Cassino, Italy, assembly plant to make door system modules. The plant will supply modules for a European auto maker Rockwell didn't identify.    In addition, Rockwell has recently signed a contract with a third European auto maker, also not identified, for door system modules.    Rockwell said it plans to establish an automotive plastics parts and systems plant in Europe &quot;in the near future,&quot; and to enter the automotive suspension market through joint ventures with European manufacturers. </TEXT></DOC>
