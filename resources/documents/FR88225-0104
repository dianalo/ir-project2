License No. 22-00057-06 was issued on February17, 1964, was most recently amended on May 6, 1987, and expires on May31, 1992. This license authorizes the Licensee to use a variety of radionuclides,including polonium-210 (Po-210), and to conduct a variety of activitieswith these materials including manufacturing, testing, installing, andrepairing radioactive sources, and the devices in which they are used.License No. 22-00057-32G was issued on July 12, 1965, most recently amendedon May 5, 1987, and expires on July 31, 1990. This license authorizes theLicensee to transfer Po-210 sources for use in static elimination devicesto persons generally licensed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR31.5. These licenses were modified by an immediately effective Order onJanuary 25, 1988, an immediately effective Confirmatory Order on February5, 1988, and a third immediately effective Order on February 12, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">II</ITAG>As more fully described in the Order Modifying License, Effective Immediately,dated January 25, 1988, the NRC had determined that the use of the above-describedstatic elimination devices had resulted in significant alpha contaminationon worker clothing and in a number of facilities. As of January 25, 1988,the root causes of these contamination incidents had not been identified.These causes could be related to manufacturing defects, the environmentand conditions of use, and/or other unknown factors. The devices initiallyof concern appeared to be Model Nos. 902, 902F, 906, and 908 that use compressedair. The total number of these static elimination devices being used bygeneral licensees was not known to NRC. The facts then known demonstratedan immediate potential for radiological hazards to persons working withthe static eliminators of those models and other persons present in thearea of use. Accordingly, the Commission found that the public health,safety, or interest required that the January 25, 1988 Order be made effectiveimmediately. The Order modified 3M's licenses and, among other things,suspended authority to distribute Model Nos. 902, 902F, 906, and 908 polonium-210static elimination devices.As more fully described in the Confirmatory Order Modifying License, EffectiveImmediately, dated February 5, 1988, NRC subsequently learned of multipleinstances of failure of Model Nos. 902, 902F, 906, and 908 devices. Manyof these failures occurred at facilities where general licensees manufactureproducts, or packages for products, such as food, beverages, pharmaceuticals,cosmetics, medical products, and other items which are to be consumed by,or applied to, humans.On February 5, 1988, the Licensee issued a letter to all of its customersusing the above-specified models of the device, directing such users toremove the devices from applications related to the packaging of food,beverages, pharmaceuticals, or cosmetics and to return them to 3M. TheLicensee's action was confirmed by Order dated February 5, 1988. The February5, 1988 Confirmatory Order modified 3M's license to require 3M to informall users of its Model Nos. 902, 902F, 906, and 908 static eliminatorsinvolved in the packaging of food, beverages, pharmaceuticals, and cosmeticsthat it was withdrawing these devices from service and that such devicesshould be returned to the Licensee.As more fully described in the Order Modifying License, Effective Immediately,dated February 12, 1988, NRC subsequently learned of failures of devicesidentified by model numbers not specified in the prior Orders. These failuresincluded both blown air and bar-type static eliminators that are used inplants that manufacture products and packages, or package materials forproducts, which would constitute a direct pathway for human exposure ifcontaminated. The cause of these failures was not then known.On February 8, 1988, 3M submitted a brief report of its work under theOrder of January 25. The staff met with 3M at Region III offices on February11, 1988 to discuss these results and to hear 3M's proposed plan of action.Among other things, 3M senior executives indicated that 3M planned to voluntarilywithdraw all static eliminators (regardless of model number) used in theprocessing of food, beverages, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics.In view of the wide use of these devices for products intended for humanconsumption or application, the increasing number of failed devices ofvarious model numbers, the uncertainty as to the failure mechanisms, andthe potential for contamination and consequent exposure to humans, theCommission found that the public health, safety or interest required thatthe February 12, 1988 Order be made effective immediately. The Order modified3M's licenses to require that 3M inform all users of all models of 3M'sPo-210 static eliminators involved in the production or packaging of food,beverages, pharmaceuticals or cosmetics that 3M has withdrawn them fromservice and they are to be returned to 3M by March 2, 1988. The Order furtherrequired 3M to submit a report to the Regional Administrator, Region III,not later than March 4, 1988, describing the extent to which it has compliedwith the February 5 and February 12 Orders.<ITAG tagnum="84">III</ITAG>During its inspection of 3M, the NRC staff reviewed 3M's records of leaktests and observations of static elimination devices that have been returnedfrom general licensees. 3M's records indicate that many devices showedmeasurable contamination and/or evidence of exposure to environments whichmay be unsuitable for the devices (e.g., solvents, moisture), but whichare often typical of the workplace and the processes in which they areused. Based upon a review of 3M's records and follow-up by NRC or AgreementState staff at these customers' sites, it appears that 3M has failed tonotify most, if not all, general licensees, whose returned devices werefound to be leaking and/or exposed to an unsuitable environment. Furthermore,3M has failed to perform effective follow-up of these reports and observations.During their inspections of these general licensees, NRC and AgreementState staff have found, in many instances, that static eliminators nowin use at customers' sites (where 3M had knowledge of earlier leaking devices)were also leaking and causing contamination of the work place.Based on information reviewed to date, static eliminators have experiencedfrequent failures in what appear to be normal and customary industrialenvironments (i.e., under ordinary conditions of use). Such failures arein direct conflict with the licensing basis for these devices includingthe requirements of 10 CFR 32.51(a)(2)(i) which states, in part, that ``[u]nderordinary conditions of handling, storage and use of the device, the byproductmaterial contained in the device will not be released * * *.'' In neitherthe February 8, 1988, report submitted by 3M nor the February 11, 1988meeting with NRC did 3M submit a meaningful plan of action required bySection III, Paragraph D. of the January 25 Order, which required sucha plan in 14 days of the date of the Order (i.e., by February 8). At theFebruary 11 meeting, 3M indicated that it would need an additional twoweeks to prepare such a plan of action.Based on the information presented above (i.e., reports of failures ofdevices not affected by the January 25, 1988 Order; 3M's failure to notifycustomers; 3M's failure to take effective corrective actions after determiningthat a returned device was leaking and/or exposed to an unsuitable environment;3M's failure to adequately respond to Section III, Paragraph D., of theJanuary 25, 1988 Order; the frequency of failures in ordinary conditionsof use), the NRC no longer has confidence that any of the Po-210 staticelimination devices authorized for distribution to general licensees byLicense No. 22-00057-32G currently meet the original licensing basis includingthe requirements of 10 CFR 32.51.The data available thus far includes analyses in the field by NRC, Stateand 3M staff showing the release of radioactive material from these generallylicensed devices. The data available also include the results of many analysesby the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), State agencies and producersof products involving the use of static eliminators for food, beverage,cosmetic and pharmaceutical use as well as in many other industrial andcommercial applications of the devices. The preponderance of these dataindicates that, although the Po-210 appears to remain tightly bound innondigestable and nonrespirable microspheres in accordance with the designbasis, the particles are released from the devices in ordinary conditionsof use. Such releases are not in accordance with the licensing basis norin accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 32.51. Given the broad useof these devices, the evolving number of failed devices being reported,the lack of effective actions by the Licensee in this matter, the pervasivepotential for exposure of personnel working with these devices as wellas other persons in the area of use, and the potential for contaminationof products manufactured with the assistance of 3M static eliminators ofall types and widely distributed to members of the public, the NRC findsthat the public health, safety, and interest require that the actions specifiedin Section IV of this Order be made effective immediately.The NRC has been informed that some of these Po-210 static eliminatorsare used in industrial or commercial service where suppression of staticelectricity is needed for workplace safety such as where significant fireor explosion hazards might otherwise exist. Therefore, in exercising thenecessary radiological safety precaution of removing these devices fromuse, the NRC recognizes the need to consider the possibility of at leasttemporarily approving continued use where competing safety risks are involvedand process surveillance is sufficient.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV</ITAG>Accordingly, in view of the foregoing and pursuant to sections 81, 161b,161c, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended,and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 2.204 and 10 CFR Parts30 and 32, <T3>It is hereby ordered, effective immediately, that license numbers 22-00057-06and 22-00057-32G are modified as follows:</T3>A. The authority to transfer any Po-210 static elimination device to personsgenerally licensed is suspended except as may be specifically authorizedin writing by the NRC.B. 3M shall immediately notify by First Class Mail (1) all general licenseesusing static elimination devices containing Po-210 and manufactured by3M and (2) all distributors outside the United States that the NRC hasissued an immediately effective Order modifying the general license providedby 10 CFR 31.5 to suspend use of such devices. The notification shall includea copy of this Order and a copy of the Order Modifying General Licensewhich is attached hereto.C. 3M shall instruct users of the devices to return them to 3M as soonas feasible but within 90 days of the date of this Order, except as providedby the Order of February 5 and 12, 1988. 3M shall also furnish its customerswith shipping instructions and packaging materials as may be necessaryfor the safe return of the devices to 3M.D. Upon receiving the returned devices from its customers, 3M shall promptlytest the devices for detectable leakage. When detectable leakage is found,3M shall notify its customers of the potential contamination of their workplaceand also notify the NRC or Agreement State, as appropriate, of the leakingdevice.E. 3M shall submit to the Regional Administrator, Region III, 799 RooseveltRoad, Glen Ellyn, Illinois 60137, written reports describing the extentto which it has achieved compliance with Paragraphs A, B, C, and D above,including the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all users whowere not notified as required, and the reasons therefore, and all userswho failed to return the devices by the dates specified in Paragraph C.Reports shall be submitted at intervals not to exceed 30 days, with thefirst report due not later than March 21, 1988.The Director, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, may inwriting relax or rescind any of the above conditions for good cause shownby the Licensee.<ITAG tagnum="84">V</ITAG>Within 60 days of the date of this Order pursuant to 10 CFR Section 2.202(b),the Licensee shall show cause why License No. 22-00057-32G should not berevoked in its entirety and why License No. 22-00057-06 should not be revokedto the extent it authorizes manufacturing of static elimination devicescontaining Po-210. The Licensee shall show cause by filing a written answerunder oath or affirmation setting forth the matters of fact and law onwhich the Licensee relies. The answer shall be submitted to the Director,Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, U.S. Nuclear RegulatoryCommission, Washington DC 20555.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI</ITAG>The Licensee and any person other than the Licensee adversely affectedby this Order may request a hearing within 20 days of the date of thisOrder. Any request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Director, Officeof Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washignton, DC 20555, with copies to the Assistant General Counsel forEnforcement at the same address, and to the Regional Administrator, RegionIII, 799 Roosevelt Road, Glen Ellyn, Illinois 60137. If a person otherthan the Licensee requests a hearing, that person shall set forth withparticularity in accordance with 10 CFR 2.714 the manner in which the petitioner'sinterest is adversely affected by this Order. A request for a hearing shallnot stay the immediate effectiveness of the actions called for by SectionIV of this Order.If a hearing is requested, the Commission shall issue an Order designatingthe time and place of any hearing.
