IBM markets the software through the CooperativeSoftware Program.andP;  No prices given.andM;IBM sets Diamond's Trackstar Plus board to catchandM;Apple II users for PS/2.andP;  The Trackstar Plus is manufactured and owned byDiamond  Computer Systems Inc, and marketed by IBM through the CooperativeHardware Marketing Program.andP;  IBM is selling it via its direct sales force andnot surprisingly, is offering academic rates to mop up lots of Apple IIapplications in schools.andP;  It is a 65C02-based co-processor board providingApple IIe emulation on the PS/2 Model 25, 30, and 30/286.andP;  It operates at1MHz or 2MHz, ;with 128Kb of main memory.andP;  With 40 and 80 column text, itsupports up to four disk drives, standard and serial ports, and anApple-compatible 5.25&quot; disk drive port.andP;  Trackstar Plus costs $2,225, butcomes in at $1,225 with academic discount rates.andP;  MUMPS/VM 3.0 runs DECapplications on IBM mainframes under VM IBM MUMPS/VM Version 3 is an enhancedversion of IBM MUMPS/VM.andP;  MUMPS, originally written for DEC PDP-11s, meetsthe Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System ANSIStandard.andP;  It supports distributed data processing, the 9370 integrated ASCIISubsystem Controller, double byte character set, and memory segment sharing.andO;IBM says that Version 3 enables current and new users of MUMPS to takeadvantage of System/370 architecture and the VM operating system - it can runapplications designed for DEC hardware on IBM mainframes under VM.andP;  MUMPSconsists of an operating environment, input-output supervisor, databasemanager and compiler.andP;  IBM says extensive VM training is not required sinceMUMPS handles all of the input-output and supervisory functions.andP;  MUMPSVersion 3 will operate on any System/370 that meets the minimum requirementsof VM.andP;  ASCII devices are supported in native mode by 9370 ASCII SubsystemController, Intel 9770/9775 Control Units Model 2, or 9370 Models 10, 12 and14 integrated 8-port RS232C/RS422A.andP;  The basic costs of Groups 10 to 60 rangebetween $15,570 and $205,400.andP;  Distributed System Licence Options start at$11,678 for Group 10 and rise to $154,050 for Group 60.andP;  Basic programupgrade charges cost between $6,000 and $113,150, and distributed systemlicence options cost $4,500 for group 10, $84,863 for group 60.andP;  Basicmonthly licence charges start at $324, and the distributed system licenceoption is $243.andP;  A basic monthly licence for Group 60 is $4,279, and thedistributed option is $3,209.andP;  Ships July 13.andM;The 4680 Store System phases out checkout girlsandM;The Check Robot Automated Checkout Machine is manufactured and distributed byCheck Robot Inc and marketed by IBM through its Cooperative HardwareMarketing Program.andP;  The Check Robot 650 enablessupermarket customers to checkout their own groceries and interfaces with the IBM 4680 Store System.andP;  Thesystem uses laser bar code scanners and a proprietary merchandise securitysystem.andP;  It consists of the machine stations, a central computer to manageand monitor the operation of self-checkout stations and communicate with thesupermarket's point-of-sale system, and one or more cashier stations.andP;  Eachautomated checkout station consists of a laser scanning device that reads barcode labels identifying merchandise passed over the device for the computers;a colour video touch screen that guides shoppers through the use of thesystem and displays a description of the items being purchased, their pricesand a running subtotal for the transaction; in stations equipped with ascanner scale, there is a related Produce Key Pad and Video Produce Screenfor handling produce and other variable weight bulk items; a proprietarymerchandise security system that compares the items passing through it withthose scanned by the shopper to ensure that all items passing through werescanned and that the correct prices were charged; and a conveyor belt thattransports scanned items through the merchandise security system to thebagging area.andP;  The Automated Checkout Machine 650 model G13 is $27,500, andthe payment station is $7,000.andP;  A Manager's Access Console is $4,800, and acustom bulk item screen package with one to five screens is $10,000.andP;  Extrascreens cost $1,000, a hand-held scanner is $800, and the cable trough is$190.andM;IBM markets Wallace's Lasermax systemandM;The LaserMax system is used with the IBM 3800 and 3835, and consists of aRoll Feeder, Paper Folder, and JobSeparator.andP;  Components may be used witheach other or as off line modules.andP;  The Roll Feeder unit can be used inconjunction with the Burster/Trimmer-/Stacker on the 3800 Page Printer.andP;  Itfeeds large-capacity 50&quot; diameter paper rolls to provide uninterruptedoperation of the 3800 for up to 8 hours.andP;  The Paper Folder is engineered tofold 8.5&quot; and 11&quot; form lengths with alternate lengths available.andP;  Anautomatic infeed ensures correct timing.andP;  The JobSeparator separates jobsafter they are printed.andP;  The following components are also available as partof a system.andP;  A Roll Rewinder option can rewind a 50&quot; diametre output roll,and the Extended Conveyer option creates custom configurations or providesadditional capacity for printer output before operator attention is required.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
