Lymphocytes after delivering4 Gy in 2 fractions showed significant infiltration surrounding cancercells compared with pre-irradiation, most of which were composed of anti-Leu-1positive lymphocytes (T lymphocytes). The majority of lymphocyte subsetswere anti-Leu-3a + 3b positive lymphocytes (helper/inducer T lymphocytes);the minority were anti-Leu-2a positive lymphocytes (cytotoxic/suppresorT lymphocytes) and anti-Leu M3 positive lymphocytes (B lymphocytes).In addition, human leukocyte antigen-DR positive tumor cells and theirinterstitial cells were remarkably observed. There was no anti-Leu M3positive cells (macrophages) or anti-Leu-IIb positive lymphocytes (naturalkiller cells). An analysis for surgical specimens after delivering 30Gy revealed no evidence for the presence of viable cancer cells. Thefindings have important implications for radiation therapy in cancerpatients.
