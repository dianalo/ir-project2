The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 25.99 to 2459.65 inmoderate trading. Longterm U.S. Treasury bond prices wereflat in light activity. The dollar was mixed, also in thintrading.</LP><TEXT>   Even though oil prices overseas were lower before U.S.stock markets opened yesterday, the mood among traders wasnegative because of the sharp drop in Tokyo stocks. TheNikkei index plunged 4.75% on Mideast jitters.   The decline in U.S. stocks nearly wiped out Tuesday's32.67 point gain in the Dow industrials. &quot;Everyone is lookingto get out now,&quot; said Christopher Pedersen, director oftrading at Twenty-First Securities. &quot;People are looking for2200&quot; on the Dow, he added.   Mr. Pedersen said another depressant for stock investorswas a report in this paper suggesting that investorsshouldn't take it for granted that the Big Three auto makers'current dividend levels are sacrosanct. &quot;That's not verycomforting,&quot; he said.   Another blow to stocks was a sharp reversal in oil pricessoon after trading began. Crude oil futures for Novemberdelivery ended the day up $1.14 a barrel at $38.67, afterbeing down briefly as much as $1 from Tuesday's close. PeterBeutel, oil futures analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group,said the initial oil price decline -- following a drop theprevious day -- was halted by some investors who saw the dipas a buying opportunity.   Oil prices kept moving higher on U.S. Defense SecretaryRichard Cheney's comments to a gathering of economists thatthe embargo may be pushing Iraq to the brink of lashing outmilitarily. Also, a spate of unconfirmed war rumors ranthrough oil trading pits -- including one that Iraq had giventhe U.S. 48 hours to leave the Mideast.   While current oil supplies appear adequate, Mr. Beutelsaid that traders are justified in bidding prices as high asthey are, since war remains a strong possibility, and anIraqi attack on Saudi Arabian oil fields is likely ifhostilities break out. &quot;Saudi oil can't be replaced,&quot; hesaid. &quot;The only people with spare capacity on that level areIraq and Kuwait.&quot;   While bond price movements were shallow, said Raymond W.Stone of Stone andamp; McCarthy Research Associates, thosemovements nevertheless followed the opposite path of oil-upin the morning on lower oil prices, down in the afternoon onhigher oil.   In major market action:                                                                                                          Stock prices fell. Volume was 155.6 million shares on theNew York Stock Exchange, where declining issues overwhelmedadvancers, 1,119 to 421.                                                                                                          Bond prices were flat. The yield on the Treasury'sbenchmark 30-year bond stood at 9.12%.                                                                                                          The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, thecurrency fell to 1.5650 marks from 1.5725 marks and roseslightly to 136.84 yen from 136.72 yen Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
