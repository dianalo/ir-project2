LyonsandM;SAN FRANCISCO -- Users already swamped by new technology should be warned:The onslaught is only beginning.andP;  The rate of change in processing power isgoing to accelerate in the 1990s, an Intel Corp. official said at the PCOutlook conference held here last week.andM;By 1993, expect a 586 chip with as many as 5 million transistors -- aboutfour times the 1.2 million transistors on the 486, said David House, vicepresident of Intel's Microcomputer Components Group in Santa Clara, Calif.andM;The 686 will have 25 million transistors.andP;  By 1999, expect a 786 chip with100 million transistors running at 250MHz and pushing 2,000 millioninstructions per second, House said.andM;The increase in raw computing power will make possible major improvements inuser interfaces.andP;  Speech and handwriting recognition, as well as full-motionvideo, will be common by the second half of the decade, House said.andM;Already, gains in computing power are making full-motion video possible.andO;House demonstrated digital video interactive technology that lets userscapture images from videotape, digitize them and then manipulate them on aPC.andP;  By next year, he said, real-time video will be showing up in commercialproducts.andM;Some commercial applications already provide similar technology.andP;  At theconference, Avid Technology Inc., of Burlington, Mass., showed a product thatlets video editors create commercials by capturing sequences from videotape,digitizing them and arranging them on a Macintosh.andP;  The program, Avid/1, letsvideo editors do their jobs about 100 times faster than they could using oldmethods.andM;Right now, the hardware to run Intel's full-motion video technology isavailable as a board set.andP;  By the mid-1990s, it will be built onto themotherboard of PCs, House said.andP;  That's because integration -- the ability toput more functionality into fewer chips -- will also accelerate in the nextfew years, House added.andM;By 1993, simple PCs will be built with a single chip, compared with 10 chipsin 1990, 70 chips in 1987 and 120 in 1984, House said.andP;  And by the end of the1990s, single-chip computers will incorporate such advanced features asfull-motion video and speech, enabling all kinds of tiny computers, he said.andM;&quot;Maybe Dick Tracy can have a full computer on his wrist,&quot; House said.andM;Integration is already enabling interesting products.andP;  For example, AgilisCorp. is selling a 386-based workstation the size of a 2-inch-thick phonebook.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
