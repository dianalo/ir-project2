MILLER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Angry dockworkers moved massiveblockades across the entrance to their port near the Panama Canalon Friday to fight off an army takeover by troops loyal to Gen.Manuel Antonio Noriega.   Noriega fired his intelligence chief and four other officers inan apparent purge of his fractured Defense Forces, which came twodays after a failed coup attempt against the military strongman.   Four American military police officers were arrested in thecapital by Panamanian authorities and held for several hours, thePentagon said.   The Panamanian newspaper Critica said the Americans werecarrying handguns, maps of the capital and ``military implements''when they were detained in an area ``where daily activitiesdisturbing the public order'' had occurred.   Panamanians, without cash for weeks, lined up at public parksand pay stations to receive partial payment and bags of food beingdoled out by the government.   Noriega gave no reason for Friday's ousters.   Col. Bernardo Barrera had been in charge of intelligence for the15,000-member Defense Forces, which includes Panama's army, navy,police and air force.   A source close to the Defense Forces said Barrera might havebeen faulted for not knowing in advance of Wednesday's coupattempt, which was said to have involved a few junior officers leadby the nation's police chief, Col. Leonidas Macias.   The other ousted officers were identified by the military pressoffice as Majs. Juan Oberto, Pablo Pinto and Jose Williams andCapt. Orlando Iguez. Their units and positions were not disclosed.   At the Balboa Port, about a mile outside the Panama Canal, about300 striking dockworkers moved car-sized containers across the portentrance to fight off an army takeover ordered Thursday by thegovernment.   ``The port is shut down,'' said one dockworker. ``We won'taccept anything less than what they owe us,'' he said, asking notto be identified for fear of reprisal. ``We'll wait here for them(the army).''   Four shipping containers were stacked across the port entrance.They formed a barricade nearly 20 feet high and no vehicles ormachinery were passing in or out.   Ports at Panama City and Colon, used primarily to receive andship cargo, closed Monday when dockworkers angry about not beingpaid went on strike. The Panama Canal Commission said the shutdownshad no effect on its operations.   In addition to the ports, the military was ordered to take overthe nation's electrical, water and telephone companies, airports,and the ministries of education, health and finance, all of whichhad been struck by workers demanding salaries.   The four American military police arrested Thursday night inPanama City were identified by the Critica newspaper as Danny H.Feltro, William Jerry, Virts Richard and Tammy Markley.   The newspaper did not provide their ranks or other information,and the Pentagon said Friday it could not immediately confirm theidentities printed by the paper.   A U.S. Southern Command statement in Panama City said the fourwere members of a military police detachment checking on the``security of dependent families'' living in the area in which theywere detained.   The U.S. militry dependents, like everyone else in Panama, havebeen without lights and water for extended periods because of therecent strikes.   Long lines of public employees, including teachers andelectrical workers, gathered at special pay stations around thecapital to receive partial payment of their semi-monthly salaries.   Each employee was receiving only $75, sometimes with $35 paid inold, commemorative Panamanian coins kown as Balboas.   The government also began handing out free bags of foodcontaining beans, rice, processed cheese and other staples of thePanamanian diet. It had been selling the bags for between $14 and$15.   More than 1,200 people lined up for the bags at a park near thecenter of the city to receive food.   The government, short of cash for months because of itsinability to renegotiate a huge foreign debt, began running out ofmoney three weeks ago when depositors began a run on the country'sbanks.   The bank run began on Feb. 26, the day after Noriega deposed thenation's president, Eric Arturo Delvalle, in a thinly disguisedcoup. Devalle had tried to fire Noriega the day before in a movethat backfired.   The action by Delvalle, who still is recognized by the UnitedStates, came after Noriega was indicted by two grand juries inFlorida on charges of narcotics trafficking.</TEXT></DOC>
