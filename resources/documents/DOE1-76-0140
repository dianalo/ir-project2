The boilers have been classified into 61 classesaccording to their size, combustion technique and main fuel. A specificemission coefficient (mg NO/sub 2//MJ) for each class has been determined,based on literature survey and actual measurements. The total NO/subx/-emission has been calculated for each class using the emission coefficientand energy statistics. The effect of various techniques for emissionreduction has also been investigated. The development of NO/sub x/-emissionshas been estimated for both the case where no preventing actions havebeen taken and for four defined cases where alternative reduction measuresare assumed. Further a calculation is made of the total investment requiredfor two of the cases. The total NO/sub x/-emission from energy productionwas 96 000 t NO/sub 2/ in 1986. Two thirds of this amount originatedfrom boilers larger than 5 MW and the rest from smaller boilers and industrialprocesses. The two most important boiler classes from the NO/sub x/-emissionspoint of view were coal fired boilers with an emission of approx. 24000 t NO/sub 2/ and boilers fired with a mixture of fuels, approx. 15000 NO/sub 2/. By 2005 the total NO/sub x/-emission from energy productionwould increase 60% to approx. 160 000 tons if it is left uncontrolled.The emission level would be 140 000 tons if primary reduction techniquesare applied and 110 000 t NO/sub 2/ if also catalytic NO/sub x/ reductiondevices are installed in boilers larger than 300 MW.</TEXT></DOC>
