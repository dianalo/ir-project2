Oracle makes data-base managers for computer systems ranging from large mainframes to minicomputers made by International Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp., as well as IBM personal computers and compatible machines.    The Macintosh version will follow an unusual pricing schedule for personal computer software. A version for programmers will sell for $199 and can be used to design customer-specific data bases. Users of a customized data base using Oracle will pay $999 for allowing many computer users linked on a network to use the program.    Oracle is one of the fastest-growing companies in the software industry. In the fiscal year ended May 31, the company earned $42.9 million, or 65 cents a share, almost triple the $15.6 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue more than doubled to $282.1 million from $131.3 million. </TEXT></DOC>
