Navy officials said the ships were struck while exercising theirright to pass through international waters. The Soviets said theU.S. ships violated its border.   And the State Department, which protested the bumping, said theincident showed once again that U.S.-Soviet relations are acontinuing blend of the good and the bad in what spokesman RudolphBoone called a ``competitive relationship.''   He said that Undersecretary of State Michael Armacost summonedSoviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin to receive a strong U.S. protest andthat Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci would raise the issue in ameeting with Soviet officials in Bern, Switzerland, next month.   The flare-up occurred Friday when, according to the Navy, thecruiser USS Yorktown was deliberately struck by a frigate and thedestroyer USS Caron was deliberately struck by a smaller coastalpatrol boat.   The two American vessels were exercising their right of``innocent passage'' within the 12-mile territorial waters claimedby the Soviets, the Navy said. The Navy says its ``assertion ofrights'' program calls for steaming periodically through contestedwaters to emphasize freedom of navigation on the high seas.   The Soviet Union countered with a charge that the U.S. Navyships violated its border, ignored warnings ``and dangerouslymaneuvered in Soviet territorial waters.''   Navy Capt. Gerry Flynn gave this account at a Pentagon briefing:   The Soviets had been shadowing the U.S. vessels since theyentered the Black Sea earlier in the week and headed northward tothe Crimean coast.   At about 11 a.m. local time Friday _ or 3 a.m. EST _ the Sovietsbroadcast the following warning to the U.S. ships: ``Soviet shipshave orders to prevent violation of territorial waters. I amauthorized to strike your ship with one of ours.'' The Caronresponded: ``I am engaged in innocent passage, consistent withinternational law.''   The two Soviet ships then closed almost simultaneously on theAmerican vessels, ``which were, as we would say in the Navy,shouldered out of the way.''   When neither the Caron nor Yorktown changed course, aKrivak-class frigate moved up on the Yorktown and a Mirka-classpatrol vessel moved on the Caron, ``grazing'' the left sides of theeach.   The Yorktown and Caron maintained their course and speed despitethe bumping, eventually steaming farther from the Soviet coast.   Flynn concluded by saying, ``the latest report I have now isthat both ships are operating routinely in the Black Sea asplanned.''   Unlike the United States, which claims a three-mile territoriallimit, the Soviet Union claims a 12-mile limit along its coast,said Cmdr. Richard Schiff, a Navy lawyer. The United States willaccept such a claim, but any country claiming 12 miles ``must allowfor innocent passage by the ships of all nations,'' he said.   A high-ranking State Department official, speaking on conditionof anonymity, said that although the department protested Sovietbehavior, he did not expect the incident to disturb a U.S.-Sovieteffort to narrow differences on arms control, human rights,regional disputes and bilateral issues.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz is scheduled to go to Moscowin two weeks to further those efforts and talk about a U.S.-Sovietsummit meeting tentatively scheduled in the Soviet capital in thespring.   Retired Rear Adm. Robert J. Hanks, a former director ofstrategic plans and policy for the Navy, said testing rights ofpassage was an important necessity for the United States, but isaccompanied by risks such as those encountered Friday.   He said the two countries set up a commission to discuss suchincidents, under what the Navy calls the ``wrinkled fender''agreement.   Efforts to assess the blame for the latest incident, hepredicted ``will be a big rhetorical contest'' with the Soviets.   Another former admiral, Eugene Carroll, who commanded ships inthe Black Sea, said such incidents are inevitable, given theconflicting U.S. and Soviet goals. He said of Friday's action:``It's really scary.''</TEXT></DOC>
