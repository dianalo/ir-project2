Measures have therefore become necessaryto enable creep-afficted pipework systems to be operated safely throughouttheir calculated lives. Operating experience leads to basic referencesfor the design of pipework. In addition practical indications are providedfor operational control in order to permit the optimum life of creep-afflictedpipework systems.</TEXT></DOC>
