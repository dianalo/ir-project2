The unit included some newly designedequipment on which special tests were made. The progress of the commissoningwas subjected to safety authority permits, issued stepwise upon successfulconclusion of previous checks. The zone within which the reactor couldoperate without instabilities was established, and the proper functioningof safety systems consequent upon the introduction of fault conditionswas demonstrated. The test results confirmed the values expected andthe plant's efficiency and output figures were better than guaranteed.The fulfillment of the commissioning programme has, in part, contributedto Leibstadt's first class early commercial performance.</TEXT></DOC>
