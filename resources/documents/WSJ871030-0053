Prices of actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds climbed nearly 1 3/8 points, or almost $13.75 for each $1,000 face amount. Prices of corporate and municipal bonds were mixed as investors continued to shift funds into debt with the highest credit ratings.    The rally prompted corporations to issue about $800 million of new debt securities yesterday. It received an additional boost from fears of potential credit problems among Wall Street securities firms.    During the past several days, corporations and other big investors have refrained from lending Treasury bonds and notes to securities dealers for brief periods. That in turn has forced many dealers to refrain from selling borrowed securities, or amassing so-called short positions. &quot;It's hard to short anything in this market at the moment,&quot; said a trader at a large government securities dealer.    &quot;There is a lot of concern right now in the financial community&quot; in the aftermath of the Oct. 19 crash in the stock market, said E. Craig Coats Jr., a managing director at Salomon Brothers Inc. Although the stock market also rallied sharply yesterday as fears of an imminent recession appeared to subside, &quot;interest rates are still likely to trend lower,&quot; Mr. Coats said.    Although the dollar tumbled to a 40-year low against the Japanese yen early yesterday, it rallied sharply as the Bank of Japan and the West German Bundesbank pumped reserves into their banking systems and said they were making credit more plentiful.    &quot;The bond market's major improvement came after the Bank of Japan and the Bundesbank issued statements that they would ease (credit) and after they followed up on these statements by injecting reserves into their banking systems,&quot; said David Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc.    In addition, he said the dollar's sharp decline early in the day occurred as the price of gold plummeted. &quot;We understand the Bank of Japan or some other central bank sold gold&quot; to assuage worries about inflation in the stock and credit markets, Mr. Wyss said. &quot;The Fed,&quot; he added, &quot;had to choose between defending the dollar and defending the economy and it decided to defend the economy. The other central banks are now cooperating with this policy.&quot;    Reflecting the fallout from the stock market crash last week, Federal Reserve data released yesterday shows that &quot;commercial banks made massive loans totaling about $12 billion to brokerage firms and other holders of securities last week,&quot; said David M. Jones, a senior vice president at Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co. According to Fed figures, such loans typically average for the week between $6.75 billion and $7 billion.    &quot;Clearly, these loans represent another side of the banking system cushioning the impact&quot; of the stock market decline, Mr. Jones said.    In a sign of growing political concern over the state of the economy, Sen. John Heinz (R., Pa.) introduced a bill yesterday directing the Federal Reserve Board to lower the discount rate to 5% or less from its current level of 6% within the next week.    &quot;The single most important act that this country can take, and it can only be taken by the Federal Reserve Board, is to cut that discount rate,&quot; the senator said. &quot;The Fed should cut it today or tomorrow or next Monday, but not later than sometime in the middle of next week.&quot;    Sen. Heinz's legislation also directs Treasury Secretary James Baker &quot;to make every reasonable effort to achieve a coordinated, simultaneous multilateral interest rate reduction&quot; among the major industrialized nations.    &quot;I do not think that we are necessarily condemned to have a recession, but I do think we have very little time in order to avoid it,&quot; Sen. Heinz said. &quot;We have little time for the Congress and the president to reach an agreement to a deficit reduction package, and we have very little time for the Federal Reserve Board to accelerate its accommodating policy which it started just a week ago.&quot;    A growing number of economists contend that the combination of a lower dollar against major currencies and the steps the Fed has already taken will be enough to keep the economy from sliding into recession in the months ahead. They also believe that the stock market collapse wiped out the potential for a big rise in inflation even if the dollar tumbles further in the foreign exchange market.    &quot;There was a knee-jerk reaction right after the market crash to get on the recession bandwagon,&quot; said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. &quot;But I've learned this economy is remarkably resilient. While those of us making a living (on Wall Street) feel the world is crashing, the rest of the country is in great shape.&quot;    In the bond market yesterday, the Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due in 2017 rose to 98 18/32 from 97 1/4 as the yield fell to 9.012% from 9.14% Wednesday. Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds climbed 7.53 points to 1240.43. The index ranged from 1229.24 to 1241.10.    The government's 8 5/8% notes due in 1997 rose to 98 3/4 from 97 5/8 as the yield fell to 8.815% from 8.99% Wednesday.    Among short-term interest rates, the rate on the Treasury's new 13-week bills eased to 5.02% bid from 5.05% bid Wednesday, while rates on new 26-week bills eased to 5.78% bid from 5.86% bid Wednesday. The rate on federal funds, or reserves banks lend each other overnight, climbed slightly to 6.75% from 6.72% Wednesday, according to Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.).    In the corporate new-issue market yesterday, a $300 million offering of an Eastman Kodak Co. bond due November 1991 was repriced by underwriters led by Merrill Lynch after Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it was considering downgrading the bonds of the Rochester, N.Y.-based photographic-products company. The 8 3/4% bonds were repriced at 99.842 to yield 8.979%, or 0.625 percentage point more than the Treasury's four-year note.
