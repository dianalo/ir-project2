Net income rose to $230 million, or $1.60 a share, from $192 million, or $1.27 a share, a year earlier.    Sales were $5.2 billion, up 9% from a restated $4.8 billion. The figures include insurance and finance revenue of $3 billion this year and $2.8 billion a year ago.    The year-earlier quarter included a charge of $16.2 million, or 11 cents a share, for reserves related to the phase-out or disposal of several investments.    The company said its various business segments showed essentially the same pattern in the third quarter as they did for the nine months, with diversified service business earnings &quot;significantly higher&quot; than a year ago, primarily reflecting higher investment income in the property and casualty business and improved group life and health business at the Hartford insurance operation. ITT Financial and Sheraton hotels &quot;posted sizable increases.&quot;    Defense technology earnings were &quot;down slightly&quot; in the nine months but are expected to be up substantially for the year.    ITT said its industrial products businesses posted higher earnings for the nine months because of a &quot;very strong performance&quot; in automotive products. Pulp and timber earnings nearly doubled for the nine months due to favorable pricing and strong market conditions.    Alcatel N.V., a French telecommunications equipment company in which ITT holds a 37% interest, &quot;continues to make a substantial contribution to ITT,&quot; the company said, with its equity in nine-month earnings more than double the year-earlier period.    For the nine months, net income rose 17%, to $637 million, or $4.44 a share, from $544 million, or $3.57 a share. Sales rose 9% to $15.5 billion, including insurance and finance revenue of $8.8 billion; a year earlier, sales were $14.3 billion, including $8.1 billion from insurance and finance.    The nine-month period a year ago included a gain of $28 million, or 18 cents a share, on the sale of Virgin Islands Telephone Corp. and the $16.2 million charge for reserves. It also includes a nonrecurring charge of $67 million, or 44 cents a share, for prior years' effect of an accounting change at ITT Defense Technology.    ITT has been buying back its shares, and had about 143 million average shares outstanding in the quarter, down 8.6 million shares from a year earlier; since June 1987 the company has bought back or retired 11.3 million shares, and repurchase of another 4.9 million shares is authorized.    ITT shares closed yesterday at $53.375, up $1.25, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
