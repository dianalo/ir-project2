PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Florida Federal Savings Bank saidthat a U.S. District Court judge in Tampa, Fla., orderedFlorida Federal to pay $17 million of restitution and finedthe bank $2.2 million for its conviction of student-loanfraud.   In addition, the bank said that the Office of ThriftSupervision has asked it to enter a consent agreement.</LP><TEXT>   Florida Federal was found guilty last month of falsifyingstudent-loan documents between November 1986 and May 1987.   Judge Ben Krentzman also sentenced Robert O. Harmas, aformer Florida Federal officer, to two years in prison inconnection with the student-loan scandal. In addition, JudgeKrentzman placed James J. LaMantia, another former officer,on probation for three years and ordered him to do 300 hoursof community service.   &quot;The court's recent decision defines a significantcomponent of the potential student-loan loss and, thereby,helps clear the way for Florida Federal to be recapitalized,&quot;said the bank's president and chief executive officer, JohnW. Sapankski.   He added that &quot;there are several investment groupscurrently performing `due diligence' on Florida Federal, andonce the student loan uncertainty is quantified and settled,we can look for investor commitments to be made.&quot;   Mr. Sapanski said Florida Federal is also negotiatingsettlements of the student-loan matter with the civildivision of the U.S. Justice Department and with the U.S.Education Department.   Mr. Sapanski said the Office of Thrift Supervision, whichhas overseen Florida Federal under a supervisory agreementfor a year, has asked the bank to enter a more stringentconsent agreement, because its regulatory capital has fallenbelow $15 million.</TEXT></DOC>
