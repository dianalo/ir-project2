<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-37-0316 </DOCNO><TEXT>The disclosed invention is a method of conducting a miscible carbon dioxideand hydrocarbon solvent flood in a steeply dipping reservoir. A mixtureof carbon dioxide and light hydrocarbon solvent is injected in the updipend of the reservoir in such a ratio as to achieve at least multiplecontact miscibility between the mixture and the formation hydrocarbons.As the flood front moves downdip with increasing formation pressure,the amout of injected enriching hydrocarbon solvent is decreased whilemultiple contact miscibility is maintained in the flood front. Hydrocarbonsand carbon dioxide are recovered from at least one production well downdipof the injection well.</TEXT></DOC>
