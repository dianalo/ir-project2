Behan, the president of Police ExecutiveResearch Forum.   ``I think lives are far more important,'' Behan said Tuesday ashe helped launch a new ad campaign _ sponsored by Handgun ControlInc. _ calling for a ban on semiautomatic assault-style firearms.   The Bush administration imposed a temporary ban on imports ofsuch weapons in March, and President Bush last week called for apermanent ban on imports that aren't intended for sporting use. Healso called for a ban on ammunition magazines with more than 15rounds.   The actions surprised the National Rifle Association, sinceBush, a lifetime NRA member, said earlier this year he opposedlimits on the weapons. His wife Barbara said they should be banned.   The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is studyingwhether the weapons are used for sports, a study that focuses onregulations on hunting and target competitions.   David Conover, an NRA lobbyist, contended that ``plinking,'' ortarget practice in open fields, is a legitimate sport, even ifthose who engage in it don't participate in formal competitions.   A public outcry for limits on the weapons erupted after a manarmed with a semiautomatic version of an AK-47 opened fire inJanuary on a schoolyard in Stockton, Calif., killing five children.The guns have also been widely used in drug-related shootings.   Behan said the proliferation of semiautomatic assault-styleweapons, ``like the proliferation of handguns, it's now becoming anational disgrace.''   Crimes involving assault-style weapons have risen 78 percent inthe past two years, he said.   ``The carnage is increasing,'' he said as he called for a ban ondomestically produced versions of the weapons as well as importedones, saying that two-thirds of the assault-style firearms in theUnited States are made in this country.   The Atlanta Constitution reported Sunday that an assault-stylegun is 20 times more likely to be used in crime than a conventionalfirearm. While only 1 million of the 200 million privately ownedguns in the country are assault-style weapons, they were used inone of every 10 crimes that resulted in a firearms trace last year,the paper reported.   Behan urged support for a bill sponsored by Sen. HowardMetzenbaum, D-Ohio, that would place some of the same restrictionson semiautomatic assault-style pistols and rifles that are nowimposed on automatic weapons, including FBI background checks andfingerprinting of purchasers. The bill also would limit magazinesize to 20 rounds.   Behan said he believes ``it's only a matter of time'' beforeCongress bans the weapons, adding, ``In any legislative approach,what wins is persistence.''   San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy said law enforcementofficials can ``overcome the lobby of the National RifleAssociation.'' The NRA ``impacts on elected sheriffs just like itdoes elected members of Congress. If we can stand the heat, so canthey,'' he said.   The Police Executive Research Forum is an organization of chiefexecutives of the largest city, county and state law enforcementagencies. Other organizations supporting bans on assault-styleweapons include the Fraternal Order of Police, the InternationalAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the National Sheriffs' Associationand the National Association of Police Organizations.</TEXT></DOC>
