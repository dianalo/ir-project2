(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The centennial of the giant flood thatswept 2,209 people to their deaths under a 70-foot wall of water isbeing marked today with a torchlight pageant and memorials.   ``The flood, they say, is an old story. But it isn't. It's asnew as Three Mile Island, it's as new as Chernobyl, it's as new asthe Alaskan oil spill,'' said David McCullough, who wrote a bookabout the flood.   The Johnstown flood was the nation's second-worst naturaldisaster. A tidal wave killed about 5,000 people at Galveston,Texas, in 1900.   Floodwaters from Lake Conemaugh, a private resort created bywealthy industrialists, broke through a poorly constructed earthendam on May 31, 1889, after several days of rain.   The waters swept 14 miles down the Little Conemaugh River Valleyand slammed into the town of 10,000 people, virtually washing itaway in about 10 minutes.   A huge pile of debris containing scores of survivors of theflood piled up against the Pennsylvania Railroad's stone bridge,which still stands across the Conemaugh River just below downtown,and caught fire, causing more deaths.   As part of today's observance, officials are opening a newNational Park Service visitors center and the renovated JohnstownFlood Museum.   A memorial is scheduled at Point Stadium near the stone bridgeand will include the lighting of a torch, the ringing of churchbells, sirens, brief fireworks and a citywide moment of silence.   The two living survivors of the flood, Elsie Frum, 106, andFrank Shomo, 100, will be the guests of honor at the annualSurvivors' Banquet at Christ the Saviour Cathedral in downtownJohnstown.</TEXT></DOC>
