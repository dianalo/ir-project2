The dependences ofthe sample resistance on the magnetic field for several fixed temperaturesbelow T/sub c/ are shown. At T = 65.5 K the sample resistance remainszero even up to a magnetic field of B = 12.4 T. Plots of the upper criticalfield (B/sub c2/) as a function of temperature near T/sub c/ are presented.They give evaluated values of B/sub c2/ = 120 T at T = 0 K and of Ginzburg-Landaucoherence length {xi}/sub GL/ = 1.4 nm at T = 0 K which are typical forthis class of materials.</TEXT></DOC>
