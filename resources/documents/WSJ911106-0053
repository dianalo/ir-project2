F-15 jet fighters,whose value may exceed $5 billion.   The move indicates escalating friction between the Bushadministration, which previously imposed a virtual moratoriumon arms sales to the region, and Saudi leaders, who areincreasingly upset that the U.S. is balking at providingtop-of-theline equipment they want for expanding air andground forces.</LP><TEXT>   The timing and size of the request, disclosed yesterday bya top McDonnell Douglas executive at an air show in Dubai,surprised industry and Pentagon officials. The move reflectsa new assertiveness by the Saudis on arms sales and poses aquandary for the Bush administration.   The request makes public a volatile issue the White Househad hoped to avoid -- at least for several months -- to giveits Middle East peace-making efforts a chance to succeed.Just last month, for instance, the State Departmentofficially informed lawmakers that the administrationwouldn't seek congressional approval of any major Arab armsdeals at least through the fall.   At the same time, the prospect of such a large foreignsale threatens to wreck Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's plansto save money by phasing out Pentagon purchases of F-15s overthe next year. Now, it will be politically much moredifficult for Mr. Cheney to close the line by arguing thatlow production rates mean the Air Force no longer can affordthe $40-million-plus price tag for each F-15.   Pentagon spokesmen declined to comment, but other U.S.officials confirmed that the Saudis last week submitted apreliminary request that remains classified. Industry andgovernment officials said that Robert H. Trice, a vicepresident of the St. Louis-based aerospace giant's militaryunit, wouldn't have publicly disclosed the request toreporters at the air show unless he had prior approval fromthe Saudi government.   &quot;The Saudis are really forcing the issue this time,&quot; saidone official at the American League for Exports and SecurityAssistance, an industry group that lobbies for arms exports.&quot;They have entered a new phase of assertiveness,&quot; he said,and the administration &quot;is going to have to deal with thisissue&quot; sooner than expected.   McDonnell Douglas had been expecting to close down thefighter line in mid-1993, but a 72-aircraft order would keepproduction going until at least the mid-1990s and preventerosion of the supplier network. Such a hefty order not onlywould be good news for the 7,000 employees working on theF-15 program, but it also would give the company anopportunity to keep upgrading the twin-engine fighter inorder to try to attract other overseas customers.   &quot;Timing is everything,&quot; Pete Von Minden, the F-15 programmanager, said in an interview, adding that other MiddleEastern countries also have expressed an interest in thefighter.   Even if the White House reverses course and quickly backsthe request, it's bound to provoke a major fight withcongressional supporters of Israel. The Saudis are seekingsome of the most advanced versions of the F-15 Eagle,industry officials said, and they initially talked aboutpurchasing only 24 of the planes.   Separately, McDonnell Douglas said it will record in thefourth quarter a gain of $75 million, or $1.96 a share, onthe sale of its Systems Integration Co. subsidiary toElectronic Data Systems Corp. The sale to EDS, a unit ofGeneral Motors Corp., was completed last Friday. Excludingseveral nonrecurring items, McDonnell Douglas earned $76million, or $2.01 a share, on sales of $4.13 billion, in lastyear's fourth quarter.   McDonnell stock was quoted at $70.25 a share, up 25 cents,in late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, whilestock prices generally declined.   ---   Rick Wartzman in Los Angeles contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
