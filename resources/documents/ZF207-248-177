 To get there you walk the city's mean streets, past the pimpsand the prostitutes, the druggies and the dealers, the heartless and thehomeless.andP;  You might pass the Pla-Boy Club, where young men stand hopefullyon the street corner with no apparent purpose, even at 9:30 in the morning;on the avenue you may spy would-be rock stars, hair dyed colors nature neverintended, who look as if they aren't sure whether it's the morning after orthe night before; and you'll almost certainly pass the storefront psychics(&quot;Tarot Readings by Helen,&quot; &quot;Psychic Tarot Cards&quot;)--though you don't stop in,because the last thing you want to find out right now in the truth about yourfuture.andM;You turn onto North Wilcox, past small, seedy-looking apartments with crackedwindows fronted by ten-year-old cars, and walk by two competing bailbondsmen--SOS Bail Bond, its phone number blazing in neon, and Active BailBonds, promising 24-hour service.andP;  Finally, you find your destination--aclean, well-lit place, a rare sight in that part of the city--the HollywoodPolice station.andP;  You walk in, ask to see a detective, and tell your tale--atale of drugs, sex, violence, lost days, and, ultimately, lost lives.andM;The Hollywood police have heard it all before.andP;  Everyone in town, it seems tothem, has a similar story to tell.andP;  At times they feel overburdened andoutgunned by a criminal element that seems to overrun the city.andP;  so, to trackdown killers who sometimes commit gruesome, unimaginable crimes, Hollywoodpolice detectives have turned to the most unlikely of gumshoes--a personalcomputer.andP;  The police computer can find connections between cases and searchfor the tiniest of clues better than a wizened veteran of the force.andP;  Usingthe PC and a customized version of the R:base database, the Hollywoodforce--and now the entire police force of Los Angeles--has access to perhapsthe ultimate detective.andM;The L.A.andP;  police aren't the only crime fighters using PCs, though theyprobably use them in a more advanced way than any other force in the country.andO;Police departments across the United States are turning to PCs to tackle thenasty, nitty-gritty chores of detective work.andP;  Whether tracking murders, drugdeals, gang violence, or robberies, somewhere a PC is probably doing thedirty work.andM;Grit, not GlitterandM;It's no accident that the PC as gumshoe got its part in hollywood, for thatsection of L.A.andP;  breeds notoriously horrific crimes.andP;  &quot;Hollywood is possiblythe kook capital of the world,&quot; says Lieutenant Edward Hocking, commandingofficer of the Hollywood Detective Division and the guiding force behindpolice use of PCs.andP;  &quot;You get the most bizarre, off-the-wall cases here.andP;  Youthink you've seen it all and heard it all, and then you get to Hollywood andyou realize you ain't seen nothing.&quot;andM;The lieutenant's office is lined with signed photos of movie stars; onefeatures Clint Eastwood and Hocking walking the department's halls together.andO;But don't let the surroundings fool you--Hocking is all grit and no glitter.andO;A 27-year-veteran of the force, he speaks matter-of-factly of sex murders,decapitations, Satanic worship, and mild-mannered professors who turn theirbasements into torture chambers.andM;There are, of course, any number of less spectacular crimes committed aswell--burglaries, robberies, drug deals, assaults, and other ordinaryepisodes of ugliness that form the underside of urban life.andP;  Every crime,from a simple purse-snatching to the most dramatic murder, requires detectivework--not to mention filling out an endless variety of forms.andM;Indeed, five years ago, it seemed to Hocking that his force spent more timefiling paper than it did chasing criminals.andP;  His detectives, he said, hadbecome &quot;clerical junkies, with no time to work on cases.&quot;andP;  Hocking had aCommodire 64 personal computer at home, and he quickly realized that itspowers--particularly those related to databases--could be invaluable to theforce.andM;Hocking knew the Commodore was underpowered for the job he had in mind.andP;  In1985, he wrangled an IBM PC AT out of a reluctant police bureaucracy andhooked up with Sergeant Jeff Willis, a police officer with a background inprogramming.andP;  Together, they created the Homicide Information Tracking andManagement Automation Network--HITMAN.andP;  After a successful pilot stint in theHollywood division, the LAPD expanded the network citywide to its 18detective bureaus and its homicide headquarters.andM;The HITMAN database holds records of approximately 4,000 homicides committedin Los Angeles, dating back to 1985.andP;  The menu-driven system is easy touse--an important factor, notes Hocking, because &quot;cops run it, not computerpeople.&quot;andM;Pentagrams and Salted WoundsandM;HITMAN is firmly grounded in police reality.andP;  Hocking drew on his ownconsiderable knowledge and also met with ten detectives from the L.A.andP;  areato decide which data would be most useful to tract for homicideinvestigations.andP;  He wanter to make the system as comprehensive as possiblebut &quot;keep it simple enough so that someone would actually use it,&quot; herecalls.andP;  &quot;We wanted to keep away from things like exotic blood typing,because that information wouldn't be readily available to detectives.&quot;andM;Detectives don't enter data into the computer themselves; clerks at thecentral homicide bureau handle that chore.andP;  Hocking believes that detectivesshould spend their time solving crimes, not punching keys.andP;  When a detectiveneeds access to the HITMAN database, he call the central homicide bureau andhas the search done for him.andM;At the start of every murder case, an investigating detective fills outseveral brief reports on the crime.andP;  The type of murder, the weapon used,possible motives, potential suspects, whether prostitution, drugs, or gangswere involved, and a great deal of other data is recorded by checking offboxes.andM;Just as important, however, are free-form areas where detective recordsinformation that does not easily fit elsewhere.andP;  R:base, is uniquely suitedamong PC databases for detective work, says Willis, because it lets policeenter text, rather than confining them to a strict structure--and it can thendo searches on that text.andP;  &quot;We had done one case where someone drew apentagram in blood on the body of his victim,&quot; Hocking recalls.andP;  &quot;In another,a guy sprinkled salt on the body of his victims and then drank the blood.andO;There's no check box on the forms for that.&quot;andM;Even more important than such dramatic modi operandi are the details that mayappear insignificant at the time of investigation, but when entered into adatabase yield significant clues because they form part of a larger pattern.andM;&quot;Let's say you have a murder where someone broke in through the bathroomwindow, sexually assaulted his victim, stabbed her, ate a sandwich, and leftthrough the front door.andP;  What's critical fact here?&quot;andP;  Hocking asks.andP;  &quot;Maybeit's that the murderer came in through the bathroom window, or that he atebefore he left.andP;  You just don't know at the time.&quot;andM;But searching through the free-form text field may later uncover usefulpatterns among homicides.andP;  If several murders began with an entry through abathroom window, for example, the police might focus their search on thinsuspects, since bathroom windows tend to be small and difficult for heavierpeople to squeeze through.andM;Hocking offers a real-life example of how this has already worked.andP;  A searchof the database for murdered prostitutes uncovered a similarity among six ofthe cases--a certain brand of .25-caliber handgun was used.andP;  Detectives nowroutinely inspect any such guns that come through headquarters, to see ifthey may have been used in those killings.andM;&quot;Under the old way of doing things, we never would have found this out,&quot; saysDetective Robert Kestler of the city's main robbery and homicide division.andO;&quot;It would have taken so long to do a search of the manual records, weprobably never even would have tried.&quot;andM;HITMAN has helped solve a number of crimes.andP;  In one case, an informant fromanother city wanted to trade information with the L.A.andP;  police in the hopesof getting a lesser sentence for his own crime.andP;  He offered sketchyinformation about a narcotics rip-off in which three people were murdered.andO;Using the information he supplied, detectives searched HITMAN and immediatelyfound the unsolved murder he was talking about.andP;  Using this information, theyeventually arrested the murderers.andP;  Without the HITMAN database, saysHocking, the police would probably not have been able to discover whichunsolved murder the informant was referring to, and the new clues would haveturned out to be worthless.andM;The program also helps police know when crimes have not been committed, whichcan be as important as knowing when they have.andP;  Hocking recalls a case inwhich a young woman came to the Hollywood police with a lurid tale ofkidnapping, rape, and murder, culminating a bloody killing deep in theHollywood hills.andP;  HITMAN was searched to see if any unsolved cases matchedthe woman's story.andP;  None did.andP;  Rather than squander resources investigatingthe alleged crime, the police checked out the &quot;witness.&quot;andP;  The woman had ahistory of mental instability, and police concluded she had fabricated thestory.andM;Hocking wishes the computer system had been developed sooner.andP;  He believes itcould have saved lives in a case from several years ago.andP;  An elderly woman inHollywood was found strangled to death with a telephone cord.andP;  It appeared tobe an isolated incident, but a year later a similar murder occurred.andP;  Hockingchecked with homicide divisions in nearby parts of L.A.andP;  and found that, ineach area, similar murders had taken place.andM;It was only then that the divisions traded information and eventually caughtthe murderer.andP;  The man was convicted of five such crimes, though Hockingbelieves he probably killed 15 people.andP;  If HITMAN had been available then, itwould have become obvious much sooner that one person was responsible, andthe divisions would have cooperated earlier on.andP;  &quot;It might have stoppedsomeone else from dying,&quot; says Hocking.andM;A Wilderness of DataandM;A database similar to HITMAN helped to solve one of the most widelypublicized strings of murders in recent Los Angeles history.andP;  Three yearsago, black prostitutes were being murdered in alarming numbers on the southside of the city.andP;  Eventually, 22 women were killed.andM;At the time, HITMAN was still under development.andP;  Sergeant Willi's work wasbecoming known throughout the department, however, and he was told to holdoff on HITMAN and instead join the 60-detective, multimillion-dollar taskforce the department had formed to solve the crimes.andP;  He was assigned todevelop a custom database to help track the serial killer.andM;The main problem, Willis soon found, was not too little information but toomuch.andP;  The task force had appealed to the public to phone in tips and soonfound itself deluged with clues: 10,000 bits of information about people,vehicles, places, events--indeed, about almost everything imaginable.andM;To tame this wilderness of data, Willis developed a system forcross-referencing every detail of every clue.andP;  &quot;For example,&quot; he recalls, &quot;aprostitute would call and say, 'This kinky guy wanted to have sex with me,and he wanted to cut my throat while he did it.' And all she'd have was a fewdigits of a license place number.andP;  Then an old lady would call in andcomplain about someone in a car who drove by and bothered her--and she'd havean entire license number.&quot;andM;Without a way to coordinate clues, the older woman's information might havebeen discounted, since she did not fit the description of potential victims.andO;But with a database, the two clues could be put together and a suspecttraced.andP;  Using the system, the police made several arrests for the prostitutekillings that eventually led to convictions.andP;  They also solved severalunrelated murders, rapes, and robberies and arrested fugitives from acrossthe country.andM;This clue-management system and HITMAN may represent the most dramatic use ofPCs by L.A.andP;  detectives, but they're not the only examples.andP;  Hocking hasdeveloped a program that automatically generates the assortment of monthlyreports that detectives formerly had to compile manually, saving Hollywooddetectives 250 man-hours a month in clerical time.andP;  Also, a group ofdetectives tracking the increasingly dangerous youth gangs in the city uses aPC database to follow a target population of 60,000 gang members.andM;Eventually, all the PC detective systems in the city may wind up tied intoone giant database.andP;  Computers may also become as ubiquitous as clipboards ina cop's daily life.andP;  Policemen could use laptop computers instead of paperand pencil to fill out reports at crime scenes, then upload the informationinto the department's mainframe.andM;&quot;Right now, there are too many standalone system,&quot; says Philip Friedman,senior systems specialist with the police department's information resourcesdivision.andP;  &quot;We want to tie it all together, so that gangs, narcotics, andhomicides can be in one big system, and so detectives can search for everyavailable piece of information at once.&quot;andP;  But, he laments, &quot;There's not anunlimited pot of money, and we have an insatiable appetite for PCs.&quot;andM;Mainframe GoliathsandM;Other police departments across the country are investigating ways to applyPC power to the science of detection.andP;  To a great extent, detectives havebeen left behind by the desktop revolution.andP;  Large police forces havetraditionally used mainframes, and only data processing professionals--notdetectives--were authorized to tap directly into crime data.andM;&quot;Detectives usually don't have very good access to the data processing outfit[in a police department],&quot; says Joan Jacoby, executive director of theWashington-based Jefferson Institute for Justice Studies, a nonprofitcorporation that studies criminal justice issues.andP;  &quot;With a PC, they can havethe necessary equipment right there in their offices.andP;  This gives them theresources to do their job and get at information when they need it.&quot;andM;Working under a grant from the U.S.andP;  Justice Department, the JeffersonInstitute is developing PC-based expert systems to help solve burglaries.andO;One system, written by Edward Ratledge, director of research at theUniversity of Delaware's College of Urban Affairs and Public Policy, runs ona Compaq Deskpro 386 and is being tested by the Baltimore County PoliceDepartment.andP;  Soon, it will see combat in Tucson, Arizona, Charlotte, NorthCarolina, and Rochester, New York.andM;The system works with information of the sort usually gathered by detectivesat the scene of a break-in: method of entry, what was stolen, what was leftbehind, and any &quot;obnoxious behavior&quot; of note.andP;  Each burglar, Ratledge notes,leaves behind a behavioral fingerprint that the system analyzes.andP;  Using a setof rules developed by Ratledge, the system assembles a description of thelikely suspect, including age, race, criminal experience, and method oftransportation.andP;  The system compares this profile with known burglars andspits out a list of suspects, ranked by the likelihood that each of them didthe deed.andM;In creating the program, Ratledge says he was &quot;trying to save theinstitutional memory of police forces.&quot;andP;  Typically, a detective transfers toa new position after one to five years, taking with him a wealth ofinformation.andP;  The program, says Ratledge, makes sure that the knowledgedoesn't transfer with him.andM;Going Where the Turkeys AreandM;Police are using PCs to help prevent crime as well as to solve cases.andP;  InConcord, California, for example, crime information is downloaded from a VAXmini-computer into a PC, which sorts the crimes by geographic location.andP;  ThePC produces a map of the city with predictions about where and when certaincrimes are likely to occur.andP;  The department assigns officers to patrol thosehot spots, says Frank Dowell, an analyst with the Concord Police Departmentwho devised the system.andP;  &quot;If you want to shoot turkeys,&quot; he says, &quot;you haveto go where they are.&quot;andM;Similarly, Miami police have used PCs to target repeat offenders--the 20percent of lawbreakers who they believe commit 80 percent of the crimes.andO;Using R:base, the police track each arrest of a career criminal and keep arecord of when hearings and sentencings will occur.andP;  Then, armed withprintouts of the criminal's record, they argue in court for a sentence ofmaximum incarceration.andM;Ed Peabody, technical coordinator with Miami's Metro-Dade Police Department,says it's no accident that such a program was developed on a PC rather thanon the department's big computer.andP;  &quot;If we had to wait for the mainframe folksto do it for us,&quot; he says, &quot;it would never get done.&quot;andM;Tomorrow's DetectivesandM;In the future, PCs will do even more, predicts Bob Wickham of Search Group,Inc., a federally funded consortium in Sacramento, California, that providestechnical support to criminal justice agencies.andP;  Wickham envisions a PC-basedsuperdetective.andM;A policeman would enter the information he's looking for into a PC linked tomany larger criminal-information systems.andP;  The PC would automatically searcha variety of databases and bring back not only the information requested, butrelated data as well.andP;  Asking the computer about, say, a suspected major drugdealer might bring back not only data on the suspect himself, but also onpotential criminal associates and even his partners in legal businesses.andM;As criminals become more technologically advanced, Wickham notes, the policemust keep pace.andP;  He says that criminals have started to use PCs to coordinatetheir illicit business operations, communicating via modern.andP;  Police havetherefore begun to attach modems to wiretaps when necessary, to capturedigital information in the same way that tape recorders nab conversations.andM;Wickham believers PCs will eventually help make DNA as useful as fingerprintsin identifying individuals.andP;  Each person's genetic structure is unique, andthe DNA that determines that structure occurs in a person's every cell.andP;  Thestructure could be digitized, stored in a PC database, and searched for, muchas fingerprints are today.andP;  With information stored in a DNA database,detectives could identify a suspect from a flake of skin or a body secretionfound at the scene of te crime.andM;These applications may be years away, but the Los Angeles model for PC usemay soon spread across the country.andP;  &quot;L.A.andP;  is on the cutting edge,&quot; saysFred Cotton, training manager with the Search Group.andP;  &quot;What they start withusually makes its way across the country.&quot;andM;Indeed, several police forces have looked at L.A.'s system and areconsidering similar applications.andP;  &quot;Our guys have been waiting [for a systemlike L.A.'s] for a year,&quot; says Lt.andP;  Kyle Edwards, head of homicide for theLas Vegas Metropolitan Police Force.andP;  &quot;They're screaming for it.&quot;andM;They're screaming not because they like the technology, but because it helpsthem do their jobs.andP;  In the end, PCs help detectives by freeing them to chasecriminals rather than shuffle paper.andP;  &quot;You're paying a detective to carry agun,&quot; says Hocking, &quot;and he needs to go out and use it to catch crooks.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
