The Oklahoma youth started using Copenhagen brand snuff atage 13, after receiving a free sample at a rodeo. Six yearslater, he died of oral cancer, and his family filed a $147million product-liability suit against UST Inc., maker ofCopenhagen. The 1986 case prompted a barrage of mediacoverage and spotlighted public attention on the dangers ofsmokeless.</LP><TEXT>   But today, the snuff business is booming. While sales ofcigarettes continue to decline, consumption of moist snuffjumped 4.6% last year, according to John C. Maxwell Jr. ofWheat First Securities Inc. UST, which dominates theindustry, is even trying to capitalize on the growinganti-smoking movement with a new product called Select thatis advertised as an alternative to cigarettes.   That's setting off alarms among public health officialsand anti-tobacco groups, who believe snuff products, and themacho marketing pitches used to hawk them, hold an especiallystrong appeal for young people. &quot;Kids start dipping at anearlier age than smoking,&quot; says Elbert D. Glover, director ofthe Center for Tobacco Research at Pennsylvania StateUniversity. &quot;We're finding kids in elementary school usingsmokeless.&quot;   Tobacco marketers adamantly deny targeting children,maintaining they are seeking only adult consumers of othertobacco products. Regardless of that intent, some industryinsiders concede the products are especially popular amongyoungsters. &quot;Kids like it because it gives them a nicotinebuzz you don't get from cigarettes,&quot; says Tracy Axton Jr.,chairman of Axton Candy andamp; Tobacco Co., a Louisville, Ky.,distributor. Adds another southern tobacco distributor:&quot;Snuff appeals mainly to younger and athletic kids, 14 or 15years old.&quot;   Perhaps because of its controversial nature, theindustry's vigor is all the more striking. In the mid-1980s,the far-reaching publicity about the Marsee case galvanizedconsumers and government regulators against smokelesstobacco, which is used by as much as 6% of the population. Ina 1986 report, the surgeon general cautioned that smokelesstobacco users run a higher risk of developing oral cancer andother dental problems, and that smokeless products can leadto nicotine dependence.   Marketers were required to add one of three warning labelsto products, including &quot;This product may cause mouth cancer.&quot;Broadcast advertising was halted. Manufacturers alsovoluntarily agreed to stop using professional athletes toendorse products and have curtailed product sampling oncollege campuses. Since then, Minnesota, Utah and Nebraskahave banned sampling of tobacco products altogether, and nowthe Federal Trade Commission is preparing to enforce the useof warning labels on such promotional items as caps and golfballs.   Remarkably, UST, which controls 85% of the $800 millionmarket for moist snuff, has emerged from the fracasunscathed. The company won the Marsee case in 1989, after anappeals court upheld a lower court verdict. Despite thenegative press, the company's tobacco operating profits havemarched steadily upward. Last year, the Greenwich, Conn.,company's net margin neared 28%, making it one of thenation's most profitable industrial companies -- and morethan three times as profitable as Philip Morris Cos.   UST's tobacco unit makes mostly moist snuff products --cured, finely ground tobacco packed in tins -- under thebrands Copenhagen and Skoal. A pinch or &quot;dip&quot; of snuffbetween users' upper lip and gum gives a jolt of nicotinethat lasts about 30 minutes. Favored by young consumers overother smokeless products such as chewing tobacco, moist snuffis the only growing niche of the tobacco industry. Chewingtobacco, made of bigger pieces of tobacco, makes for amilder, though sloppier, experience.   The recovery of smokeless is a result, in part, ofaggressive marketing tactics honed by UST. At a time whenmarketers of liquor and tobacco have come under increasingpressure for target marketing, UST has quietly continued thestrategy. That's been possible because few of its customersare professionals, and most of its low-profile marketingefforts take place outside media centers. The company targetsmostly white, blue-collar males who work in factories or onfarms, or in such industries as lumber, steel and energy.   To reach that audience, UST does little print advertising.Instead, it and other smokeless tobacco makers have learnedto fish where the fishing is good. They spend millions tosponsor such events as auto racing, rodeos, monster truckshows and tractor pulls, where their blue-collar customersare likely to gather. &quot;The motor sports and fishing peoplelove these companies,&quot; says Lesa Ukman, editor of SpecialEvents Report, a Chicago newsletter.   To reach into rural areas where few big sporting eventsoccur, Pinkerton Tobacco Co., the Richmond, Va.-based makerof Red Man chewing tobacco, has even acted as a promoter toorganize country western concerts. That allows Pinkerton tobring local artists to small towns that most promoters wouldoverlook. To grab a bigger piece of the faster-growing moistsnuff market, Pinkerton is in the process of rolling out anew moist snuff product under its Red Man brand.   UST also has been adroit at developing a steady stream ofnew products to keep consumers dipping. The companyrevolutionized the industry in 1983, with its introduction ofSkoal Bandits, snuff packaged in pouches that look like tinytea bags. UST is now testing its Select brand, which is alsoin pre-measured pouches, in four markets. The milder productcomes in what looks like a cigarette package, rather than inthe traditional tin. Ads for Select aim to lure puffers bycommiserating that &quot;Just when you'd love to have a smoke, youfind you're in a place where you can't.&quot;   What's more, the industry giant has an enormous salesforce it can unleash for product sampling at special events-- a key strategy for introducing new products since the banon broadcast advertising. Bill Melton, a marketing consultantand a former executive at Pinkerton, figures UST's salesforce at about 400, as large as its two nearest competitorscombined, Conwood Co. and Pinkerton. &quot;They hire people whoactually use the product,&quot; says another tobacco distributor.   But public health officials worry that the tobaccomarketers have been so successful in crafting a macho aurafor their brands, that dipping has virtually become a rightof passage for boys in rural areas. &quot;Dipping is seen as amanly thing to do, and boys are experimenting with what it'slike to be a man,&quot; says Herb Severson, a research scientistat the Oregon Research Institute. Mr. Severson, apsychologist involved in smoking prevention, says junior highkids in Oregon use smokeless tobacco at a higher rate thancigarettes.   Critics also say the frequent presence of snuff tins inthe back pockets of professional baseball players serves toincrease the product's appeal in the eyes of children. Freesampling programs to major league and minor league teams havebeen in place since the 1950s, though about one-third of allprofessional teams have banished free samples from theirclubhouses. Still, about 34% of the players use some form ofsmokeless tobacco regularly, according to a 1988 studypublished in the New England Journal of Medicine.   Despite the fact that his team has banned free samples ofsmokeless tobacco, usage seems to be increasing, according toRon McClain, the trainer at the Montreal Expos. &quot;The olderplayers do it, and the younger players coming up see them doit, and then they start.&quot;   Still, manufacturers claim they are doing what they can toprevent the products from falling into the hands of children.The Smokeless Tobacco Council Inc., a trade group, has urgedtobacco retailers to limit sales to consumers over 18. Sofar, 43 states have established a minimum age for purchasingsmokeless tobacco, though in some states the legal age isonly 16.   UST maintains that it focuses its marketing effort only onadult males who already use some form of tobacco. &quot;Smokelesstobacco is an adult product,&quot; says a UST spokesman. &quot;Weadhere to a strict code that prohibits us from advertisingand marketing efforts that appeal to youth.&quot;   Bob Seidensticker, chairman of Pinkerton, says his companytakes pains never to hand out product samples to children atevents, and doesn't send any tobacco products through themail. &quot;Every single sample clearly states the product is forconsumers over 18,&quot; he says. &quot;We're acting in a veryresponsible way.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
