L. 92-463,notice is hereby given that a two-day meeting of the Sediment CriteriaSubcommittee of the Environmental Effects, Transport and Fate Committeeof the Science Advisory Board (SAB) will be held on February 2 and 3, 1989.The meeting will begin at 9:00 a.m. and will be held in the CongressionalRoom of the Quality Inn Capitol Hill, at 415 New Jersey Avenue, NW., Washington,DC. The meeting will adjourn no later than 5:00 p.m. on Friday.The Subcommittee has been charged with evaluating the scientific and technicalfoundations of methodologies available to the Agency for estimating sedimenttoxicity and the biological impact of inplace contaminated sediments. Inaddition, the Subcommittee has agreed to comment on the feasibility ofutilizing each methodology to determine the extent of contamination andrisk posed to the environment and human health. Research directions willalso be identified for strengthening each methodology reviewed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>PURPOSE: </T2>The specific purpose of this meeting is to review theEquilibrium Partitioning (EP) Method. The technical aspects of this methodologywill be presented by Agency staff for evaluation by the Subcommittee. Inaddition, the relationship between water quality criteria and the EP approachwill be explained. The importance of contaminated sediment issues to Superfundactivities will be discussed, and a Case Study will be described by EPARegion 1 staff. Finally, the potential for further development and applicationof the EP method will be explored, including assessment and applicationto metal contaminations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: </T2>This meeting will be open to the public.Any member of the public who wishes to present information, or receivefurther details should contact Ms. Janis C.
