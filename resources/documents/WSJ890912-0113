Your contention that the corn-sweetener industry is competitive only because of U.S. sugar quotas is simply wrong. High fructose corn syrup is the lowest-cost sweetener in the world. It is competitive with sugar in any market where sugar prices are not driven below production costs by government subsidy.    If jobs have been lost in the soft-drink industry it has nothing to do with the U.S. sugar program. Domestic consumption and production of soft drinks has boomed in the past eight years. That's because the TV ads are right -- natural sweeteners are a good deal for consumers. If they were as expensive as you make it sound, consumption would be declining, not rising.    Robert C. Liebenow    President    Corn Refiners Association    Washington    ---   The assertion that this country's sugar-quota program &quot;fleece{s} the average family of four to the tune of $100 per year&quot; is wrong. The U.S. retail price is commensurate with the global production cost. There are no figures to support your ludicrous claim to the contrary. The average family of four pays less than $100 a year for all the refined sugar it consumes.    The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade did not rule that U.S. quotas were illegal per se. It claimed the administration used the wrong legal authority to apply import constraints, which, not incidentally, are similar to those in many other countries. Also, more than 13% of the sugar consumed in the U.S. last year was from foreign sources, not 8% as you claim.    You maintain U.S. sugar growers &quot;get a support price of 24 cents per pound -- twice the world price,&quot; but the fact is the government loan rate for raw sugar is 18 cents and the current New York # 11 spot price for world sugar is in excess of 13 cents.
