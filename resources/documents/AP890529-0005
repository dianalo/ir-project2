Picking up where the National Conference of Catholic Bishopsleft off, three agencies within the 1.7 million-member UnitedChurch of Christ are asking the church to work for a constitutionalamendment to guarantee every American a minimum income, meaningfulemployment and affordable housing.   The proposed pronouncements to be voted on by several hundredclergy and lay delegates to the 17th General Synod in Fort Worth,Texas, represent ``the unfinished work of the Americanexperiment,'' according to Audrey Chapman of the UCC's Office forChurch and Society.   The synod runs from June 29 to July 4.   Others within the nation's fifth-largest mainline Protestantdenomination characterize the economic proposals as unrealistic, anexample of a church bureaucracy out of touch with its predominantlyupper-middle-class constituency.   Support for such proposals can be found ``primarily in the leftwing of the Democratic Party or the Socialist Party,'' said W.Widick Schroeder, a professor of religion and society at theChicago Theological Seminary.   This is not the first time the denomination has tackledcapitalism.   In 1934, in the midst of the Depression, the General Council ofthe Congregational Christian Churches, one of the forerunners ofthe Church of Christ, condemned capitalism and voted 130-17 to``work toward the abolition'' of the economic system. The GeneralCouncil disclaimed the resolution in 1952, five years before thedenomination merged with the Evangelical and Reformed Church toform the UCC.   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops has been the mostrecent dramatic entrant into the discussion over religion and theeconomy, drawing fire from individuals such as former TreasurySecretary William Simon with its proposal that every person shouldhave the right to a job.   The United Church of Christ proposal would take the Catholicidea a step further by calling for a constitutional amendment.   In its proposed pronouncement on ``Christian Faith and EconomicLife,'' the Office for Church and Society of the UCC is proposingthat the church work for such an amendment to guarantee such``rights'' as a national health program, a national minimum incomeand ``a right to employment consistent with each person'spotential, including a role for the government as employer of lastresort.''   The proposal was judged too conservative by some groups, tooradical by others.   A separate pronouncement recommended by the Commission forRacial Justice and the Council for Racial and Ethnic Ministriesseeks the same constitutional guarantees, but adds a call for ``atransformation of the capitalist economic system.''   In an effort to present a united front, representatives of thethree sponsoring groups recently developed a proposed compromisepronouncement that adds some data showing how minorities bear anunequal burden of poverty and unemployment, but drops theanti-capitalist language of the original pronouncement submitted bythe groups representing minorities in the church. Thedenomination's Pension Boards, which oversee $800 million in churchinvestments, share a different perspective.   Schroeder, who worked on a report to synod delegates by thePension Boards, called the proposed economic bill of rights``utopian'' and unworkable. He argued that greater governmentintervention will promote inefficiency, leading to fewer resourcesand greater strife over the distribution of wealth.   But Rebecca Blank, one of the creators of the bill of rightsproposal, said the United States, unlike some developing nations,has the means to provide for all its citizens.   ``I think it's almost entirely an issue of political will inthis country,'' said Ms. Blank, a professor of economics and publicaffairs at Princeton University.</TEXT></DOC>
