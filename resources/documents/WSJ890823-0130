Philips's European assets in the field, the companies said.    The value of the transaction, which both sides hope to complete by year end, wasn't disclosed. Thomson-CSF, 56%-held by state-owned Thomson S.A., wouldn't disclose how it plans to finance the acquisition of the divisions, which have total annual sales of four billion French francs ($605.9 million). The transaction was approved by the French and Dutch governments.    The move comes at a time of deep restructuring in the European defense-electronics sector, marked in the past few months by the planned takeover by West Germany's Daimler-Benz AG of Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. and a joint takeover bid for Britain's Plessey PLC by Britain's General Electric Co. and West Germany's Siemens AG. Thomson-CSF officials say these moves led the French group to seek opportunities for expansion to maintain its ranking as Europe's biggest defense-electronics group. Defense electronics accounted for 92% of Thomson-CSF's 1988 sales of 33.5 billion francs.    &quot;Thomson is first in Europe in defense electronics, but our competitors were catching up,&quot; a Thomson official said. &quot;Philips wanted to sell its activities in that field, so we thought it was in our interests to talk with them.&quot;    Indeed, the Dutch electronics giant has been restructuring its activities and shedding assets to focus on telecommunications and civilian electronics. Philips said it believed that the future of its European defense-electronics activities was best ensured by placing them under the control of the European leader in the field.    Under the current discussions, Thomson would buy a sizable majority stake -- estimated at about 80% by financial sources -- in Hollandse Signaalapparaten BV, or HSA, the European market leader in naval command and control systems. Philips would retain a minority interest, but it's unclear what will happen to the 1% the Dutch government currently holds in HSA, which also makes radar and fire control systems as well as military telecommunications equipment. HSA had 1988 sales of about 900 million guilders ($408.2 million), but Philips officials wouldn't confirm rumors that it has been unprofitable for the past couple of years.    By gaining control of HSA, Thomson would acquire two HSA units, one based in West Germany, and one, Philips USFA BV, based in the Netherlands. For security reasons, however, the encryption activities of Philips USFA, which develops coded message systems for the armed forces, will be excluded from the transaction.    Thomson also seeks to acquire a 100% stake in the defense activities of France's Telecommunications Radioelectriques andamp; Telephoniques SA, or TRT, and a minority stake in the defense activities of Philips's Belgian unit, MBLE. Philips currently controls only 49% of TRT, and neither side would disclose details of the TRT transaction. A Philips spokesman said &quot;a certain number of measures will be taken, but we can't talk about them today.&quot; Trading in TRT shares was suspended last week on the Paris Bourse, when rumors of the impending transaction first surfaced.    TRT's defense activities accounted for about 38% of TRT's 1988 sales of 4.1 billion francs and are believed to be profitable, although TRT as a whole posted a 1988 loss of 47.4 million francs. Its defense activities include opto-electronics, munition electronics and radio-navigation and communications equipment.    MBLE's defense business, in the field of military telecommunications and radar computers for aircraft, accounted for only about one quarter of its 1988 sales of about 200 million guilders. </TEXT></DOC>
