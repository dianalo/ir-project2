Also today, the Beirut weekly Ash-Shiraa quoted unidentified``non-Arab'' sources as saying armed women have been moving theWestern hostages to new hideouts in Beirut and its suburbs.   A U.N. source said two Norwegian soldiers, serving with theUnited Nations' peacekeeping force in south Lebanon, were slightlywounded when they tried to stop militiamen of the Israeli-sponsoredSouth Lebanon Army from carrying out arrests in the southernvillages of Ibl El-Saqi and Rashaya.   The source, who insisted on anonymity, said the militiamen threwgrenades at the Norwegian soldiers, who were manning a checkpoint.   The Voice of the South, the radio of the South Lebanon Army,said the militia rounded up several young Shiite men forquestioning in connection with Wednesday's bombing.   It said most arrests were made in the village of Khiyam. Khiyam,Ibl El-Saqi and Rashaya are in Israel's self-designated securityzone in south Lebanon, which is patrolled by the South Lebanon Armyand Israeli troops.   On Wednesday, a Shiite Moslem clergyman detonated a truck bombin south Lebanon as an Israeli patrol passed by. Five Israelisoldiers and an SLA militiaman were injured.   The pro-Iranian group Hezbollah said the attack was to avengeIsrael's July 28 abduction of Sheik Abduk Karim Obeid, aHezbollah-affiliated cleric.   Ash-Shiraa did not say whether the reported moving of theLebanese hostages was related to Obeid's abduction.   The weekly said the hostages were transported in ``medium-sizedbuses, equipped with every comfort _ beds and chairs. ... As forthe windows, they were curtained so no one could see anythinginside (the bus).''   Ash-Shiraa said the ``women kidnappers'' in long black chadorsmoved the hostages at night and were equipped with automaticweapons to be used only under ``utmost necessity.''   The report could not be independently verified.   Ash-Shiraa gained international renown in November 1986 when itbroke the story of secret U.S. arms sales to Iran in return for therelease of hostages. But its recent reporting on the hostages hasnot been accurate.   Ash-Shiraa did not say when the hostages were moved.   There are 16 foreign hostages in Lebanon, _ eight Americans,four Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and two West Germans. Mostare believed held by Shiite Moslem extremists loyal to Iran.   Longest held is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He was abducted March 16,1985.</TEXT></DOC>
