AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Soldiers stormed the building whereopposition leader Guillermo Endara was holding a hunger strike, buta colleague said he was safely spirited away before the raid.   A nearby resident said the troopers fired tear gas in the raidlate Thursday. It came hours after Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, whosurvived a coup attempt Tuesday, told the nation that thegovernment would get tough with its opponents.   Endara, the former opposition presidential candidate, ``is nowin a safe place,'' a collegue, Willie Cochez, said later Thursday.He would not elaborate.   Endara is in the 16th day of a fast. He wants Panamanians todelay tax payments and boycott government lotteries and casinos,thus depriving the government of needed revenues.   In Noriega's televised speech, he ridiculed Endara's hungerstrike and said he had evidence that the United States had plannedto install Endara as president. Noriega annulled May 7 nationalballoting that international observers said Endara was winning by a3-1 margin.   Noriega compared the coup attempt with the failed U.S.-backedBay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 and said he would propose apackage of ``war laws'' dealing with national security.   Brandishing a rifle given him by supporters and quoting aSpanish proverb, Noriega promised ``blows for the undecided, leadfor the enemy and silver for the friend'' in a speech fromSantiago, 150 miles west of Panama City.   A resident living near the opposition office where Endara hadbeen staying said two truckloads of soldiers surrounded the block,stopped traffic and then entered the building. apparently lookingfor Endara.   Journalists were kept 200 yards away from the scene.   Associated Press photographer John Hopper was hit on the headand his equipment was confiscated. The wound required stitches.Equipment also was taken from a cameraman for an Americantelevision network.   Cochez would not say how Endara managed to leave the officeswithout being captured by troops.   Security forces were at the building throughout much of the day.When reinforcements arrived, eight gunmen in civilian clothes firedin the air outside Endara's office, dispersing scores of supporters.   Earlier, members of the Defense Forces dressed in civilianclothes entered the building and arrested two people. They heldeverybody inside for three hours.   Ten rebels died and 23 people, including three members ofNoreiga's general staff, were arrested when troops loyal to thegovernment crushed the revolt, the government said.   Calling the coup attempt another Bay of Pigs, Noriega said theUnited States ``had left in the lurch those it had bribed.''   He said American troops from the Southern Command militaryinstallations along the Panama Canal tried to block loyal forcesfrom coming to his rescue when soldiers took him hostage in theDefense Forces headquarters building.   ``They should not be hypocritical,'' Noriega said referring tothe United States. ``They were involved.''   In Washington, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the rebelscontacted U.S. military officials in Panama and requested possibleblockage of routes leading to the headquarters building. He said,however, President Bush never gave the orders to block the routes.   The United States has used political and economic pressure toforce Noriega from his post as chief of the Defense Forces sinceFebruary 1988, when he was indicted in Florida on drug traffickingcharges.   Noriega denies the allegations and says the U.S. is trying toback off 1977 treaties that give his country control of the PanamaCanal in 1999.   Dressed in civilian clothes and wearing a Panama hat, thegeneral said in the speech the ``war laws'' would boost theeconomy, benefit the people and ``take away the privileges of thetraitors.''   In a referrence to the jubilation that overtook governmentoffices during the coup attempt, Noreiga urged government employeesto list ``traitors'' in their ranks.   ``Public employees who are not nationalists must be fired so wecan give those jobs to worthy men,'' he said. ``A public officialwho does not fire the traitors is himself a traitor.''   Questions persisted about whether the rebel soldiers killed diedduring the conflict or later. Nine of the 10 who died were officers.   The government has said only that they died in the coup attempt.</TEXT></DOC>
