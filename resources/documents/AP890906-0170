I think it'll make the stockholders and the depositors alittle bit more careful about what they're doing with theirinstitution,'' said Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas.   The Sandamp;L bill, signed into law Aug. 9 by President Bush, directsthe Treasury Department to finish a study of the deposit insuranceissue in 18 months. But Gonzalez says action may be needed sooner.   ``They've had studies galore. ... The pressure on the depositinsurance fund continues,'' he said in an interview Tuesday.   The Sandamp;L legislation provided taxpayer dollars to rescue failedthrift institutions and shored up the commercial bank fund by nearlydoubling insurance premiums charged to banks, but Gonzalez said thesystem is still vulnerable to ``unexpected but not unforeseenevents'' such as a dramatic deterioration of heavily indebtedcorporations or Third World countries.   Gonzalez said he wants to hear testimony on the issue beforemaking up his mind but said he currently favors reducing the maximuminsurance coverage from $100,000 and limiting the number of insuredaccounts per depositor.   However, proponents of the current system argue that it hassuccessfully prevented a recurrence of the wave of bank failuresthat struck the nation in the Depression.   And, they argue that reducing deposit insurance would favor largebanks over small ones. Depositors would shift their money to biginstitutions, believing regulators would not close a big bank forfear of the shock of a large failure to the financial system, theysay.   Gonzalez said he also favors examining uninsured money marketmutual funds, which he called the ``loose cannon'' of the financialsystem.   ``It is a source of worry,'' he said. ``I'll guarantee you thatnine out of 10 people that have their money in those mutual moneymarkets, uninsured, don't know that they're not insured. ... Thathas to be looked at.''   Commercial banks hold about $2.4 trillion in deposits, followedby Sandamp;Ls with $960 billion, money market mutual funds with $330billion and credit unions with $195 billion. All except mutual fundsare federally insured.   Part of deposit insurance reform will be a look at banks' use oftheir deposits, including investing in leveraged corporate buyoutsand in securities underwriting, Gonzalez said.   Any attempt to reform federal deposit insurance is sure to sparkfierce debate in Congress. In January, just before President Reaganleft office, White House economic advisers suggested that depositinsurance ought to be ``curbed.''   But even that vague recommendation provoked strong criticism frommembers of Congress, including Gonzalez. Although he didn't rejectreducing deposit insurance then, he chastised the timing of Reaganadvisers who floated the idea at the height of depositor concernover Sandamp;Ls.   In recent weeks, the topic has been raised in banking circlesmore frequently. William Isaac, former chairman of the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp.; Lee Hoskins, president of the FederalReserve Bank in Cleveland, and John S. Reed, chairman of Citicorp,the nation's largest bank company, have all outlined proposals forforcing large depositors to assume some losses in a bank failure.   Meanwhile, Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the bankingcommittee's financial institutions subcommittee, has scheduledhearings Sept. 19-21 to examine the health of the insurance fundsfor commercial banks and credit unions.</TEXT></DOC>
