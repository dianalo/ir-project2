Theequation of ion motion in matter under the action of magnetic and electricfields with multiple ion scattering taken into account is analyzed fora {mu}/sup 4/He/sup +/ cyclotron. Being continuously accelerated in vacuoduring one tenth of its life time the {mu}/sup 4/He/sup +/ ion wouldreach 96 MeV. The ''pincers'' are proposed which may offer the feasibilityof a self-sustaining fusion reactor based on M-catalyzed fusion. Thetechnical difficuties are assumed to be enormous. 3 refs.; 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
