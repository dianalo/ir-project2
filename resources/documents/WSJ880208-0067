The Canadian dollar is benefiting from Canada's attractive yield spreads and a robust economy.    In addition, some of the attention drawn to the U.S. dollar's big rebound so far in 1988 is spilling over to the Canadian currency. &quot;When foreign money comes sloshing into these markets, some of it sloshes over into Canada,&quot; says Lawrence L. Kreicher, vice president and international economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, New York.    Since trading down near 75 U.S. cents last November, the Canadian dollar has risen 4.5% to 78.83 U.S. cents, where it stood in late New York trading Friday. The Canadian dollar's strength against its U.S. counterpart is underscored by the Canadian dollar's 2.5% rise against the U.S. currency since the first of the year, a period in which the U.S. dollar has rallied strongly against most other major currencies, climbing 8.4% against the West German mark and 9.8% against the Swiss franc.    In fact, the dollar's 1988 rally is helping the Canadian dollar's recovery because the two major North American currencies are so closely related, economists say. The dollar rebound that began Jan. 4 with a torrent of central bank intervention reduced many concerns about the foreign exchange risks in both currencies and shifted investor attention to the relatively high yields offered in the two countries. And of the two, Canadian interest rates are the most attractive.    The yields on three-month Treasury bills last week were 8.25% in Canada, which was a 260 basis-point edge over the 5.65% yield on U.S. Treasury bills. The spread has generally been widening since November.    That has decreased the incentive for U.S. companies to repatriate cash generated by their Canadian operations, says Robert K. Ryan, vice president and corporate foreign exchange adviser at Irving Trust Co., New York. &quot;Right now, people love to leave their money up there,&quot; he says.    The widening yield spread between U.S. and Canada is due to the divergent stances of their respective central banks. The Federal Reserve, primarily concerned with avoiding a recession, has let U.S. interest rates fall since the Oct. 19 stock market crash. The Bank of Canada also eased its monetary policy immediately after the crash, but in November the central bank began tightening due to inflation worries. &quot;The episode has been extremely instructive in providing clues about Bank of Canada policy and it is clear that the balance of concern is now on the inflationary front,&quot; writes David Morrison, vice president and chief international economist at Goldman Sachs International Corp., London.    Nevertheless, some economists, including Merrill Lynch's Mr. Kreicher, see the U.S. inflation rate outstripping Canada's this year. At the same time, economic growth in Canada is expected to outpace growth in the U.S. in 1988, according to many forecasts, aided by the arrival of tourist dollars for the Calgary Olympics and benefits from the free-trade agreement reached with the U.S. earlier this year.    A recession could trip up the Canadian dollar's recovery and a resumption of the dollar's decline against other major currencies would almost certainly drag the Canadian dollar down too.    However, according to Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, the Canadian dollar should rise to a level of purchasing power parity with its U.S. counterpart, which he says lies between 85 and 90 U.S. cents, by the middle of next year.    ---   Friday's Activity   A bullish interpretation of weak U.S. job growth figures lifted the dollar higher against most major currencies.    The dollar initially softened on the release early Friday morning of U.S. employment data for January. It rebounded at midafternoon New York time when players interpreted the weak growth in nonfarm payrolls to mean slackened demand for imported goods and, therefore, improvement in the U.S. merchandise trade deficit.    From a technical standpoint, traders said the dollar convincingly crashed through the important technical resistance point of 1.7 West German marks, a level the U.S. currency had been attempting to penetrate for most of the week. The dollar ran up to an intraday high of 1.7045 marks before falling off a bit in late New York trading. At the end of the business day, the dollar stood at 1.702 marks, up 1.1% from 1.6832 Thursay. The dollar also rallied 1.2% to 129.43 Japanese yen, from 127.95.    The dollar was stable in early trading Monday in Tokyo. The dollar was quoted at about 129.25 yen, up from 129.15 yen at the opening.    The Labor Department reported Friday that nonfarm payrolls rose 107,000, compared with market expectations of 228,000 and a revised increase of 311,000 jobs in December.    &quot;After all was said and done, the market thought the nonfarm payroll number was good because if the economy slows a bit, we will import less and our trade deficit will surely shrink,&quot; said Mark Pletscher, financial markets adviser at BankAmerica International, New York.    Gold was quoted at $438.05 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Friday, Feb. 5, 1988    Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
