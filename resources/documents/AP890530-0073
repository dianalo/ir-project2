The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that ads run bythe Problem Pregnancy Center in Fort Worth violated a state lawbanning deceptive trade practices.   The center is run by a charitable corporation, Mother and UnbornBaby Care of North Texas Inc. Lawyers for the center had arguedthat the state deceptive-practices law should not apply because thecenter receives no money for services it provides.   State Assistant Attorney General Stephen Gardner urged thejustices to reject what he said was a request for ``aconstitutional right to lie to pregnant women, to entice them intoa fake abortion clinic'' where they are urged to continue theirpregnancy.   A state court jury ordered the center and its director, CharlesJ. Pelletier II, to include prominently in all future ads that thecenter is not an abortion clinic and does not provide abortionreferrals or medical services.   The jury also imposed $39,000 in civil fines and ordered thecenter's corporate operator and Pelletier to pay $49,025 inattorneys fees incurred by the state.   A state appeals court upheld the jury verdict, and the TexasSupreme Court refused to review the case last Nov. 16.   Pelletier placed ads in the Fort Worth Yellow Pages under theheading ``Abortion Information and Services.''   During a seven-month period in 1986, more than 1,000 women wentto the center, most of them then considering an abortion.   According to the state appeals court, the women generally weregiven a free pregnancy test. While waiting for the results, theywere taken into a room to see slides and a videotape showinggraphic pictures of abortion procedures.   Counselors, including Pelletier, then attempted to persuade thewomen not to abort their pregnancies, according to the state court.   State authorities said, ``The record of the jury trial isreplete with the experiences of pregnant women who were trickedinto going to Pelletier's center by Pelletier's deceptiverepresentations.''   They added, ``Pelletier used the tactics of avoidance, evasionand concealment to draw in as many women considering an abortion aspossible to force them to hear his message without regard to theirwillingness or need to hear it.''   The appeal filed in behalf of the center and Pelletier saidnumerous legal actions similar to the Texas lawsuit ``have beenfiled across the country against anti-abortion clincs to preventthem from being able to communicate information on abortion tothose pregnant women.''   The appeal added, ``In a truly free society, speech which isnon-defamatory, non-obscene and does not economically benefit thespeaker, directly or indirectly, must remain free of anyconstraints.''   The case is Mother and Unborn Bab Care of North Texas vs. Texas,88-1627.</TEXT></DOC>
