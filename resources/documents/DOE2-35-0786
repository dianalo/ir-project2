<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-35-0786 </DOCNO><TEXT>In recent years, a number of external dosimetry problems have been solved.However, changes in standards and legal concepts relating to the applicationof dosimetry results will require further enhancements in measurementtechniques and philosophy in the next 10 y. The introduction of effectivedose equivalent and the legal use of probability of causation will requirethat much greater attention be given to determination of weighted organdose from external exposure. An imminent change--an increase in the fastneutron quality factor--will require a new round of technology developmentin a field that has just received a decade of close scrutiny. For thefuture, we must take advantage of developments in microelectronics. Theuse of random access memory (RAM) and metal-on-silicon (MOS) devicesas detector elements, particularly for neutron dosimetry, has excitingpossibilities that are just beginning to be explored. Advances in microcircuitryare leading, and will continue to lead, in the development of a new generationof small, rugged and smart radiation survey instruments that will makethe most of detector data. It has become possible with very compact instrumentsto obtain energy spectra, linear-energy-transfer (LET) spectra, and qualityfactors in addition to the usual integrated dosimetric quantities: exposure,absorbed dose, and dose equivalent. These instruments will be reliableand easy to use. The user will be able to select the level of sophisticationthat is required for any specific application. Moreover, since the processingalgorithms can be changed, changes in conversion factors can be accommodatedwith relative ease. During the next decade, the use of computers willcontinue to grow in value to the health physicist.</TEXT></DOC>
