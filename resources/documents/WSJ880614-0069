The suit, filed in U.S. District Court here, seeks to halt deportations of farm workers, most of them Haitians, whose requests for amnesty under the new immigration law have been denied.    It charges that &quot;arbitrary&quot; changes in procedures made by the INS in September have placed &quot;an impossible burden of proof&quot; on the farm workers to produce payroll records as evidence of their labor on U.S. farms.    &quot;For the most part, these people were paid in cash under the table,&quot; said Cheryl Little, one of the attorneys who filed the suit. &quot;The records don't exist.&quot;    The INS tightened the program's procedures after massive fraud was discovered in the program, said INS District Director Perry Rivkind, who called the suit &quot;frivolous.&quot; Under the agricultural amnesty program, farm workers have until the end of November to prove they worked 90 days in U.S. farms between May 1985 and May 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
