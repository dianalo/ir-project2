Introduction </ITAG>The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has determinedthat issuance of licenses for four proposed projects on the mainstem SnakeRiver, the Twin Falls, Milner, Auger Falls, and Star Falls Projects, wouldconstitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality ofthe human environment. The FERC staff, therefore, issued a Draft EnvironmentalImpact Statement (DEIS) in November, 1987. Due to new circumstances, newinformation that became available after the DEIS was issued, and new staffalternatives, FERC issued a Notice of Intent to Prepare a Supplement tothe DEIS (Supplement) on July 15, 1988. Public meetings were held in TwinFalls, Idaho on August 18, 1988, to discuss the new circumstances, informationand staff alternatives. The Supplement will include only sections of theDEIS that have changed, and sections which will be added. The FERC staff will not hold scoping meetings to: (1) Present to the publicand experts familiar with the Snake River Projects environmental issuesexpected to be covered in the issues presented; (3) clarify the significanceof issues; (4) identify additional issues that merit treatment in the Supplement;and (5) identify issues that do not merit treatment in the Supplement.Agencies and individuals with environmental expertise and concerns areencouraged to attend the meetings ands assist FERC staff with the determinationof issues to be addressed in the Supplement. <ITAG tagnum="84">2. Proposed Actions and Alternatives</ITAG>2.1 Description of Proposed Actions The locations of the four proposed projects are shown on Figure 1. <ITAG tagnum="81">2.1.1 </ITAG><T3>Amended Star Falls Project</T3>_Changes in project configuration include: a larger and higher dam locatedupstream of the original diversion site (50-foot-high dam versus 20-foot-highweir); a powerhouse (1 MW unit) located at the dam; a buried penstock onthe north side of the river instead of a canal on the south side of theriver; a powerhouse (35.8 MW unit) located on the north side of the riverinstead of the south side and upstream of the original powerhouse site._ The size of the reservoir would increase, with 5.2 miles of free-flowingriver inundated instead of 3.5 miles with the original proposal. _ Access to the project would be provided by upgrading the existing roadthat leads to Star Falls from the north canyon rim, instead of constructinga new access road from the south canyon rim as originally proposed. _ Project operation would be changed from run-of-river (inflow equals outflow)to store-and-release during the irrigation season and run-of-river duringthe nonirrigation season; the applicant is also considering peaking operationsfor power generation during the nonirrigation season. 2.2 Supplemental Mitigative Measures Proposed by ApplicantsSupplemental mitigative measures were proposed for the Milner Project andfor the Twin Falls Project in filings dated March 31, 1988. Mitigativemeasures for the amended Star Falls Project are proposed in the draft amendedapplication for license filed on September 9, 1988, which has also beenprovided to the agencies for their comments; the application for amendmentto license is expected to be filed on November 17, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="81">2.2.1 </ITAG><T3>Milner Project</T3>_Minimum flows for fisheries are proposed to be 58 cfs leakage from thedam during the irrigation season, with an additional 92 cfs during thenonirrigation season, for a total of 150 cfs._Upland wildlife habitat would be developed and donated to Idaho Departmentof Fish and Game. _New proposals for recreation include: building an interpretive centerwith picnic facilities; building additional water ski dock(s) on Milnerreservoir; further development of public facilities at a Bureau of LandManagement Wildlife Habitat Management Area; building a kayak launch; anddeveloping a communication network to quickly inform kayakers of flow conditionsbelow Milner dam. <ITAG tagnum="81">2.2.2 </ITAG><T3>Amended Star Falls Project</T3>_Minimum flows for fisheries in the bypassed reach are proposed to be 160cfs during the irrigation season and 250 cfs during the nonirrigation season._Cofferdams, berms, check dams, and sediment ponds would be used to controlerosion and sedimentation and protect water quality. _Ramping rates would be used during reservoir drawdown and filling to reduceimpacts on aquatic resources. _An off-site mitigation area for aquatic, terrestrial, and recreationalresources would be located on a 3/4-mile-long reach of Rock Creek locatedabout 12 miles from Twin Falls. _An on-site developed recreation area would include parking, toilets, picnicfacilities, fire pits, campsites, and put-in facilities for whitewaterboating. _Releases from the dam would be provided for whitewater boating downstreamof the powerhouse during the summer. Interpretive signs would explain the historical significance of Star Fallsand Caldrin Linn._A series of several viewpoints would be made along the inner canyon wall.<ITAG tagnum="81">2.2.3 </ITAG><T3>Twin Falls Project</T3>_Release of flows over Twin Falls to enhance visual quality would be providedto coincide with periods of greatest recreational use of the project area._Two alternative plans have been proposed for flows to be released overTwin Falls; Plan A would provide 140 cfs during daylight hours on weekendsand holidays all year, and Plan B would provide 140 cfs during daylighthours on weekends and holidays for September to March and provide 140 cfsdaily during daylight hours from April to August. _A small weir would be constructed at the top of the falls to direct thewater over both sides of the falls, to create a similar visual impressionfrom a flow of 140 cfs as is seen with flows of 300 and 500 cfs; the weirwould not be visible to people viewing the falls. 2.3 Alternative Mitigative Measures Proposed by the Staff<ITAG tagnum="81">2.3.1 </ITAG><T3>Target Flows</T3>_Target flows may be set for a variety of resources, including fisheries,water quality, visual quality, and recreation. _The State Water Plan specifies zero flow below Milner dam, so in orderto be consistent with this comprehensive plan, target flows in the bypassedreach of the Milner Project, can only be provided when there is water availablein excess of irrigation needs. _A target flow at the other projects would be equivalent to the minimumflow which would otherwise be recommended for the bypassed reach; all inflowmust be released up to the target flows, which must be met or exceededbefore a powerhouse at the bottom of a bypassed reach could be operated.<ITAG tagnum="81">2.3.2 </ITAG><T3>Comprehensive Water Block (CWB)</T3>_The objective of the CWB is to provide water for target flows at the projectswhen it is available, so that irrigation needs would be met and consistencywith the State Water Plan can be maintained._The CWB is the combined amount of water needed to provide target flowsfor mitigation of project-specific and cumulative impacts for all of theprojects; the size of the CWB would vary with the number of projects thatare licensed and constructed._Each project that is licensed and constructed would provide a subblockto the CWB; the size of individual subblocks would be different for eachproject since target flows would be based on what is needed to mitigateimpacts at each specific project._The size of the CWB would vary from year to year depending on the amountof flow in the river and the availability of water in excess of irrigationneeds._Licensees could potentially lease water for the CWB from the Water SupplyBank, described in Policy 4B of the State Water Plan, which also statesthat use of the Water Supply Bank created by Idaho Code 42-1762 shall beencouraged; water has been available for rental in all years since thebank began operation in 1979, and is expected to be available in sufficientquantities to meet the needs of the CWB in most if not all years in thefuture, based on current staff estimates._Target flows to be set for the projects will recognize the physical limitationsof the system so that they will not interfere with irrigation operationsor flood low-lying areas._Flows to be released for project-specific target flows could be accountedfor when the water is released from American Falls reservoir, and measuredbelow Milner dam._The CWB could be an accounting mechanism, for licensees to equitably sharethe responsibility for providing mitigative flows, since water which isreleased from American Falls reservoir would flow through all the proposedprojects.2.4 Alternatives to the Proposed Action<ITAG tagnum="81">2.4.1 </ITAG><T3>Milner Project Staff Alternative</T3>_One or more small turbines would be installed at the dam in addition tothe large turbine proposed for the powerhouse to be located 1.6 miles downstreamof Milner dam.<ITAG tagnum="81">2.4.2 </ITAG><T3>Auger Falls Staff Alternative</T3>_Penstocks leading from the proposed canal to the powerhouse, would beshifted towards the south side of the river and placed in a natural ``niche''in the face of the cliffs in order to minimize blasting that would be neededto excavate the trenches for the penstocks; placing the penstocks alongthe existing road to the Rock Creek powerhouse and constructing the AugerFalls powerhouse next to the existing powerhouse will also be evaluated,as this would eliminate blasting of the cliffs._Access to the powerhouse would be from the end of the road leading tothe existing Rock Creek powerhouse located on the Snake River near thesouth end of the cliffs, instead of constructing a new access road alongthe river and leading to the north end of the cliffs as originally proposed._The transmission line could be relocated to follow the existing Rock Creektransmission line and eliminate a river crossing for the Auger Falls transmissionline.<ITAG tagnum="84">3.
