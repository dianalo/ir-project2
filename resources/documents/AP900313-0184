A blunt one, asked in a different kind of ``Peanuts'' specialthat CBS is showing Friday night. Rest assured, though, that theending is upbeat, in keeping with medical fact and the nature ofCharles M. Schulz.   Schulz, who has drawn the wise and whimsical characters of his``Peanuts'' cartoon strip since 1950 and did his first TV specialin 1965, hadn't thought of making his next one about a child whodevelops leukemia.   What became Friday's ``Why, Charlie Brown, Why?'' began, hesays, with an idea from Sylvia Cook, a nurse in California whoworks with young cancer patients at Stanford Children's Hospital.   She proposed a five-minute film for them in which cancer and itstreatment were explained by the ``Peanuts'' gang. He recalls thathe pointed out a few problems, including that animation isexpensive.   That didn't stop Cook, Schulz says.   ``Gradually, her idea changed, and she finally decided that it'dbe more important if we could do a film that would show the peoplearound the person who was ill just what is going on,'' he says.   Wth the aid of the American Cancer Society, that's ultimatelywhat happened. It helped that Schulz came to believe the film wouldmake a good ``Peanuts'' special for TV and shouldn't be limited tohospital showings.   The gentle lessons of Friday's show include the early symptomsof leukemia and what can be expected in treatment of the disease.   A key part of the program _ the survival rate of childrenstricken with leukemia _ is only obliquely noted, mainly because amass of statistics would be as out of place in a ``Peanuts''special as a visit from The Simpsons.   Little Janice, in chemotherapy treatment that she notes willcause her temporary hair loss, quotes her doctors as saying sheshould get well.   The survival rate for children is high, according to ACSspokesman David Lehmann. He says the society estimates 2,500children will be stricken with leukemia this year, 1,900 of themwith its acute form.   However, thanks to advances in treatment, 71 percent areexpected to survive, he says.   Schulz, who worked with the society in preparing Friday'sspecial, downplays his role in it.   ``I didn't go into making this thing because I wanted to teachthe world all about this,'' he says. ``This was the idea of thecancer people. It was their project. My only job was to make itpalatable, to give it some kind of story and try to tell the thingsthey wanted told, yet make it so that people wouldn't turn it off.''   Schulz, 67, who lives in Santa Rosa, Calif., about an hour'sdrive north of San Francisco, estimates Friday's is his 25th TVspecial since ``A Charlie Brown Christmas.''   He still draws the seven-day-a-week ``Peanuts'' strip that byCBS' estimate appears in more than 2,200 newspapers worldwide. Hereckons he's drawn 15,000 of the strips since he began them 40years ago.   More than a few cartoonist have groused that the constantpressure of a daily strip at times has put them up against thewall, if not under it. No such gripes are heard from Schulz.   ``No, quality is the only thing that worries me,'' he says. ``Idon't worry about getting them done. I'm always worrying that I'lljust end up doing the same things over and over.   ``Just to try to keep the thing alive, and be trying new things,that's the hard part. Just getting it done is nothing. I thinkcartoonists who say it's hard to keep up the schedule are justlazy, that's all.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television ...
