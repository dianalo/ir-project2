He said the Justice Department has concluded that federal courtswould rule unconstitutional any statutory attempt to circumvent therecent Supreme Court decision overturning flag desecration laws.   ``The only way to protect the flag is through a constitutionalamendment,'' said Fitzwater. He said Congress should pass theBush-backed amendment if it ``is serious about protecting theflag.''   ``The President is adamant in his support of the public demandto protect the flag. Flag-burning is an affront to America'spatriotic values. It (the flag) should be constitutionallyprotected,'' he said.   Bush has endorsed an amendment saying that ``The Congress andthe states shall have the power to prohibit the physicaldesecration of the flag of the United States.''   Some lawmakers and legal scholars, including House SpeakerThomas S. Foley, D-Wash., have raised concerns about whatconstitutes desecration and whether the amendment would weaken theBill of Rights. Some lawmakers also say enthusiasm for an amendmentis waning among their constituents.   However, Fitzwater said he thinks public sentiment is runningstrongly in favor of the effort to amend the Constitution.   One reporter asked Fitzwater why the flag needed specialprotection when ``crosses have been burned longer in this countrythan flags, and despite those burnings, the Christian faith andchurch have survived.''   ``Regardless of that, we still believe flag-burning should notbe legal,'' Fitzwater replied.</TEXT></DOC>
