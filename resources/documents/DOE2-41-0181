The Team's observations and recommendations arebased, in a large part, upon licensed reactor facility practices usedto meet industry standards. These standards form the basis for many ofthe comments in this report. The Team believes that a uniform minimumstandard of performance should be achieved in the operation of DOE reactors.In order to assure that this is accomplished, clear standards are necessary.Consistent with past AEC and ERDA policy, the team has used the standardsof the commercial nuclear power industry. It is recognized that thisapproach is conservative in that the K reactor has a significantly greaterdegree of inherent safety (low pressure and temperature) than a licensedreactor.</TEXT></DOC>
