Some 40% of families, however, haven't kept pace with the increasing cost of living during the past decade, said the study by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank.    The report said salaries for most women have increased faster than inflation, while salaries for all but the richest American men haven't kept up.    The study documents a growing gap between rich and poor in the United States and says that young adults who don't finish college are doing &quot;substantially worse&quot; than those who were the same age a decade ago.    Economists Stephen Rose of Seattle and David Fasenfest of Louisville, who wrote the report, said they used statistical methods that take into account family size. They also used the most conservative cost-of-living figures to overcome objections to previous studies that also showed widening inequality and slow income growth. Some conservative economists have argued that Americans are doing better because families are smaller even if family incomes haven't kept up with inflation.    &quot;This is an important first step in measuring the real economic benefit of having a wife work,&quot; Mr. Rose said. He said figures cited by the Reagan administration and others seem to show improved economic conditions while polls show that people think they are worse off.    Income from a working wife, he said, may add to family income but may cost more in child-care, restaurant and other expenses.    The report says the number of working wives increased to 66.1% in 1986 from 55.4% in 1979.    Wives' earnings, adjusted for inflation, increased 12.1% from an average $14,064 in 1979 to $15,768 in 1986, the study says, while husbands' adjusted earnings dropped from $23,204 in 1979 to $22,240 in 1986.    Even with wives working, the study says, roughly two out of five American families -- those earning less than about $27,000 a year in 1986 -- earned more than they did 10 years ago but the increase didn't keep up with inflation. Adjusted income for all Americans increased 7.3%, however.    If women had worked only the number of hours they did in 1979, the study says, average wages would have increased only 4.9%, with three out of five families, or those earning less than $40,000, lagging behind the inflation rate.    With more women working, average adjusted family income increased from the equivalent of $38,492 in 1979 to $41,288 in 1986, the study says.    The nation's wealthiest 20% earned nine times more than the poorest in 1986, compared with seven times in 1979, the study says. The top group includes families that earned more than $59,533 in 1986. Their income averaged $94,104, compared with $9,133 for the lowest fifth of the population. </TEXT></DOC>
