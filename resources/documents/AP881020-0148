AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Honduran president said othernations should pressure Nicaragua ``to become a democracy'' andblamed the Sandinista regime for the hundreds of thousands ofrefugees from the civil war.   President Jose Azcona Hoya said 55,000 Nicaraguans are inrefugee camps along his country's southern border, in addition toabout 8,000 Contras who retreated after U.S. military aid ended inFebruary.   Azcona Hoya blamed Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government forthe problem. ``A government that creates refugees and politicalexiles cannot be a good government,'' he said in an interviewTuesday.   He said there must be an ``international reaction to pressureNicaragua into a political solution'' of the problem.   ``Let us assume that (President) Reagan was wrong and hispolicies of support for the Contras were wrong. Well, now theUnited States is stepping aside. There is no more military aid,''Azcona Hoya said.   ``What is to be done? Other countries must become involved andforce Nicaragua to become a democratic country. It is time thedemocratic countries of the world take a firm stand on this,'' hesaid.   The Contras are receiving non-military aid under a $17 millionprogram Congress approved in March, the same month Nicaragua'sleftist government and the Contras began a cease-fire. The truce isstill in place, but peace talks that would lead to a permanentsolution have broken down.   Last month, Honduras issued a call at the United Nations for apeace force involving Canada, Spain and West Germany to patrol itsborders with Nicaragua and El Salvador. Few believe the proposalwill be carried out.   Azcona Hoyo called it ``a drastic move to show that we are notinterested in attacking Nicaragua,'' whose government ``has notacted like someone concerned about peace.   ``When they could push for a dialogue, they have toughened theirstand internally, jailing political opponents. Now that the Contrais silenced completely they go to the opposite side and do not tryto look for reconciliation.''   Honduras, the recipient of substantial U.S. military aid, hostsU.S. military forces and has long harbored Contras in their waragainst the Sandinistas. More than 1,000 U.S. soldiers arestationed in Honduras.   The United States has built installations in Honduras to monitoractivity in Nicaragua and staged joint military exercises withHonduras. The Americans have directed Honduran troops to the borderat least once to repel Nicaraguan troops chasing Contras.   More than 200,000 Nicaraguans live in Honduras, a nation of 5million people. Honduras is also home to tens of thousands ofrefugees from the civil war in neighboring El Salvador.</TEXT></DOC>
