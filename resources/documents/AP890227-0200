The crisis facing the new government of President Carlos AndresPerez was the worst in 30 years of democratic rule in Venezuela.   Hundreds of Venezuelans looted stores in downtown Caracas, blocksfrom government offices, breaking windows and carting offmerchandise ranging from air-conditioners to jewelry.   ``Government!,'' shouted a young man, warning others of theapproach of a jeepful of rifle-toting police.   Police fired in the air, but looters defied orders to stop andcontinued to rampage. They finally scattered into nearby buildingsas gunfire continued.   No figures emerged on injuries or arrests, but a police officerestimated at least 100 police were injured by rocks and home-madeexplosives.   Television stations estimated 40 civilians were wounded inCaracas by birdshot fired by police.   One looter carted away a washing machine.   ``I'm doing this because everybody else is,'' he said.   ``The last time I saw this was the 23rd of January, 1958, thefall of the dictator,'' said German Guedes, a toothless, old man,pulling on a new pair of shoes inside a building as firing persistedoutside.   Venezuelan strongman Gen. Marcos Perez Jimenez was toppled in1958, leading to 30 years of stable, democratic rule.   A woman caught in the cross fire as she tried to get homecomplained that the looters were criminals taking advantage of whatstarted out as a protest by students against increased publictransportation tariffs.   ``They're just criminals, robbing, burning. I've never seenanything this bad,'' she said, crying.   Major avenues across the city, with buses blazing, looked likemovie scenes of hell. Fires in poor neighborhoods in the hills onthe outskirts of the city burned through the afternoon and evening.   Sculptor Carlos Mendoza said residents of one wealthyneighborhood stood on street corners and exchanged impressions ofthe violence, the first time he'd seen people in the neighborhoodcome out of their houses to talk to each other.   Police said they expected the government to declare a state ofemergency, but observers said the looting and riots across thecountry caught officials by surprise.   ``They don't want to send out the national guard because theydon't want repression,'' said a police officer. But as he spoke,national guard riot troops with plastic shields patrolled a nearbystreet.   ``The government doesn't know how to respond. We've never hadthis kind of thing before,'' said a young man.   When asked what he would do if the situation continued, he saidhe would probably join the looters.</TEXT></DOC>
