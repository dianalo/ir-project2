The proposal by the Labor Department's Occupational Safety andHealth Administration would cover 660,000 employees of electricutilities and related services, the government said.   The regulations, subject to a public comment period before theytake effect, were drafted in cooperation with the InternationalBrotherhood of Electrical Workers and the Edison Electric Institute,a utility industry trade group.   The guidelines would affect such routine tasks as using laddersto enter manholes as well as work on exposed electric lines bytree-trimmers and repair workers.   OSHA said it would cost about $21 million to bring utilities incompliance. The regulations would not cover construction andtelecommunications workers who face similar hazards. Those workersare covered by separate standards.   The tighter rules were proposed for electric utility workersbecause they encounter far greater risk of electric shock and falls,OSHA said in a statement. The proposal does not cover electric powerplants not run by utilities but OSHA said it was consideringextending the rules at a later date to cover all electric powergeneration, transmission and distribution.   The agency said full compliance with the regulations shouldeliminate 24 to 28 of the approximately 75 work-related fatalitieseach year among covered workers. More than 3,200 injuries alsoshould be prevented, OSHA said.   Electric shock accounts for half the deaths and injuries in theindustry.   To protect workers from shock, the guidelines would require wideruse of protective equipment such as insulating blankets, gloves andsleeves. A number of training and safety measures also are includedin the proposed guidelines.</TEXT></DOC>
