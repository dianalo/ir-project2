As a result, conservation energysources will significantly increase their share of the energy servicesmarket through the 1980s. This paper concentrates on the sources of thisenergy services input, after reviewing the pattern of Canadian energydemands and some major aspects of conservation energy. From the reviewit is evident that there is great potential in Canada for the use ofconservation energy that does not entail cutting-back and that is competitivewith conventional energy. Attempts have been made to quantify the costsof conservation energy and some results of this work are presented. Successin capitalizing on conservation energy opportunities will improve economicperformance by efficiently reducing the proportion of expenditure outlayson conventional energy. There are also opportunities to improve Canadiancapabilities in what may be termed the energy conservation industries.In developing these industries, there is a great need to design conservationand renewable energy technologies that operate efficiently in Canadianclimatic conditions. 2 refs., 4 figs., 21 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
