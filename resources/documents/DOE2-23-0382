<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-23-0382 </DOCNO><TEXT>The development program for superconducting materials at TWCA is involvedin improving NbTi alloys, refining and implementing the modified jellyroll approach to manufacturing multifilament composites, and fabricatingproduction-scale quantities of high resistance ratio niobium for radiofrequencycavity research. The program provides a link between customer needs andTWCA mass production processes by designing, monitoring, and evaluatingexperiments. Results of research conducted in high-homogeneity and barrier-cladNbTi alloys and in bronze route and tin core approaches to the modifiedjelly roll method are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
