At a news conference just hours after Tuesday's coup attempt wasput down, they said the action was crushed with relative ease.   That the rebellion was put down without a shot being fired wasgood news indeed for Cerezo and Gen. Hector Gramajo and supportiveof the decade-old trend of military-to-civilian rule in LatinAmerica.   Still, that a coup attempt was mounted at all shows that thetradition of military rule dies hard. Nearly 3{ years into Cerezo'sfive-year term, Guatemala is struggling to solidify the foundationof what would be its first modern democratic period.   Civilian authority remains conditioned on military consent andsupervision.   ``The army is doing everything possible so that the era of coupspertains to the past,'' Gramajo told The Associated Press inAugust, three months after his forces quashed an uprising similarto Tuesday's. ``Nonetheless, traditional forces are doingeverything possible so that it does not. As of now, I'm winning.''   He would probably contend he is still winning.   ``It pains me to have to report on this because the action of aminority affects the prestige and attitude of the entireinstitution,'' he told Tuesday's news conference.   But it is difficult to imagine Gramajo would candidly agree withCerezo's sweeping declaration that, ``The army has once againfulfilled its responsibility ... and there is no problem.''   Gramajo said Tuesday's uprising appeared to be an attempt torevive the rebellion that occurred nearly a year ago.   ``The officers who were cashiered came up with this way ofcelebrating last year's coup attempt and keeping the movementalive,'' he said.   He referred to two colonels, a captain and a major expelled fromthe armed forces after their bid to overthrow the government wasthwarted last May 11. He said the four were among 12 officersinvolved in Tuesday's rebellion.   Gramajo last year blamed rightist civilian landowners,businessmen and industrialists _ the ``traditional forces'' _ forfomenting the coup bid.   Representatives of the agro-export and business organizationsalluded to as sponsors of the rebellion denied they participated.   Cerezo told the news conference that no civilians wereimmediately implicated in the latest move against him. But he saidthe coup attempt would be investigated and any civilians involvedprosecuted.   Gramajo said rebel air force troops backed by two helicoptergunships and an A-37 warplane had blocked two major highways on theedges of the capital Tuesday and that rebel troops also tried tomarch on his home.   He said the rebels, numbering at least 300, turned back whenthey encountered a superior force of loyalist troops.   Gramajo and Cerezo said all but two of the coup plotters were incustody as well as an unspecified number of soldiers.   That the subversive movement of last year's plotters could be``kept alive'' undermined Gramajo's contention that, because of the1988 rebellion, the army was stronger and more cohesive.   ``We had the chance to discover vulnerabilities and we correctedthem,'' he said in August. But the military, as demonstrated byTuesday's rebellion, is not monolithic.   Gramajo acknowledged in last year's interview that for most ofthis century power was in the hands of a corporate institutioncomprising the business and agricultural capital and the armedforces. Their alliance provided sumptuous wealth to a tiny minoritywhile relegating the majority, most of whom are Mayan Indianpeasants, to extreme poverty.   Cerezo, a centrist Christian Democrat, was bent on at least someredistribution of wealth when he took office. Though he has seenmost of his initiatives thwarted by established interests, the farright considers heretical even the intention to chip away at itsprivilege.   He said the most significant development in recent Guatemalanhistory is the ``process of breaking that bond between thetraditional sector and the army.''   But he quickly added: ``This is a process. It is not yet adeed.''</TEXT></DOC>
