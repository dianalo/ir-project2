The computer giant indicated its earnings for the firstquarter would plunge 50%, rather than be flat as manysecurities analysts had expected. Profit for all of 1991 willalmost surely decline, not post the 5% rise analysts hadexpected. Revenue will be flat at best for the quarter, andprobably rise only slightly for the full year.</LP><TEXT>   The problems, which arose so quickly they stunnedanalysts, cover most of IBM's product lines. Only software,services and workstations seem to have escaped. The problemsalso cover most of the world.   Equally unsettling, if open to dispute, was IBM'ssuggestion that plenty of its rivals will keep it company inreporting lousy results. IBM says its extensive internalnetwork reports that its problem isn't that it is losingbusiness to competitors. The problem, it says, is thatcustomers have simply stopped buying.   A wide range of companies involved in desktop computing --semiconductor manufacturers, software producers, personalcomputer and workstation makers -- say they haven't yetnoticed any unexpected weakness. Apple Computer Inc., forinstance, says that &quot;business continues to be strongworld-wide,&quot; while Intel Corp., the bellwether maker ofmicroprocessors, says that &quot;overall, we are not seeing anypullback&quot; among big customers. But makers of largercomputers, which still account for the bulk of the industry'srevenues, confirm a slowing trend, citing problems both inthe U.S. and in Europe.   Economists say weakness in the computer industry wouldhave wide repercussions. Lacy Hunt of Hong Kong Bank GroupLtd. says the IBM report is &quot;the first tangible evidence&quot;that previously strong industry sectors -- he singles outexports, capital goods and defense-related businesses -- arestarting to falter. &quot;There's going to be a second leg to thisrecession, one that is substantially different in characterthan the first leg,&quot; Mr. Hunt predicts.   David Hale of Kemper Financial Services Inc. says IBM'spessimism about international markets should mostly beinterpreted &quot;as a sign that we are now entering a Europeanrecession, not just an American one.&quot; Mr. Hale says heexpects that the U.S. economy will start a consumer-ledrecovery by midyear, but that poor conditions in Europe willcause multinational companies like IBM to suffer for sometime. &quot;There will be a lot of negative earnings shocks out ofEurope for the next six months,&quot; he thinks.   Lawrence Klein, a Nobel Prize economist at the Universityof Pennsylvania's Wharton School, cautions against readingtoo much into statements by a single company, however large.&quot;We would have to see more than one major company before weinterpret it in terms of the entire economy,&quot; he says. Still,while Mr. Klein continues to predict a broad recovery laterthis year, &quot;I definitely will be marking down the strength ofthat recovery because of this.&quot;   Following an IBM conference call with analysts yesterdaymorning, IBM's stock slid $12.75 to $115.125 a share incomposite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. It tookmost of the rest of the market along with it, with the DowJones Industrial Average plunging more than 62 points,although a bad inflation report also hurt. Many, though notall, technology stocks were hit hard. Digital EquipmentCorp., for instance, fell $5.25 to $71.375.   Although not all computer companies are yet seeingproblems, there are reasons to think most of them may.SoundView Financial Group Inc., a brokerage firm, sayssurveys that it has been doing with market-researcher GartnerGroup Inc. have found corporate customers planning just a 2%increase in computer budgets this year. This is the smallestrise the firms have found in the eight years they've beendoing the surveys. Normally, budgets increase 5% to 7%.   Jim Fischer, a partner at Andersen Consulting, says thebig systems integrator is finding that customers may take 50%longer these days to agree to buy a big computer system. SkipBattle, another partner, adds that customers also are takingmuch longer to install the whole system. Work that a year agomight have been spread over 18 months may now be budgeted for22, he says.   Even when customers still spend the big bucks, less ofthat may find its way to computer companies' bottom lines.Gartner Group figures that computer-industry operatingearnings more than doubled in the past 10 years, to more than$24.6 billion. That's an impressive figure by most anystandards. But revenue nearly quadrupled during that stretch,to $271.5 billion, meaning profit margins shrank as theindustry became more cutthroat. IBM, for its part, generated50% more revenue last year than it did in 1984 but producedabout 10% less net income.   Much of the earnings pressure has come because smallcomputers, with their razor-thin profit margins, areencroaching on turf once reserved for the big iron. NorthwestAirlines, for instance, recently completed a system that willlet it keep track of what happens to all tickets, rather thanjust doing a sample of 10%. That way it can see, forinstance, whether tickets it issued were used on anotherairline. The system would once have required lots ofmainframes, but Northwest wound up using 600 Sun MicrosystemsInc. workstations and just one midsized IBM mainframe.   Tom Grudnowski, the Andersen partner who worked withNorthwest on the project, says a similar project beingstarted now probably won't need that mainframe.   In addition, computer companies seem to have settled intoa discounting pattern that they can't shake. So much of acomputer's price reflects the cost of developing it that itcosts companies very little to actually make a machine oncethe manufacturing lines are up and running. The raw materialsare just some sand, a little metal and some plastic. So whencompanies get into trouble, they slash prices to buy a littlerevenue, and they sometimes force healthy companies to playthe same game.   &quot;There probably needs to be more consolidation in thisindustry,&quot; says Steve Cohen, an analyst at SoundView. &quot;Butthe companies don't go away quickly. There are big egos inthis industry and a lot of capital, so the companies bleedfor a long time, and when they bleed they make a lot of othercompanies bleed with them.&quot;   Currency-exchange rates had been expected to mask anyproblems that might surface in the first half, but those,too, have started to turn against computer makers. IBM, forinstance, generates more than 60% of its revenue and a higherpercentage of its earnings overseas, and many of itscompetitors are in similar situations. When the dollarweakens as much as it had over the past year, that increasesthe value of overseas earnings and revenue when they aretranslated into dollars. But the dollar has rebounded overthe past few weeks. Jay Stevens, an analyst at Dean Witter,says that while currency rates contributed 40 cents of IBM's$4.30 a share of fourth-quarter earnings, currency willprobably just add five to 10 cents in the first quarter.   Digital Equipment, the nation's second-largest computermaker, says it's seeing some of the same problems IBM does.International sales, which have buoyed results for threeyears in the face of weakness in the U.S., are weakening, thecompany says. &quot;Even some of the more resilient economies inEurope, like Germany, are slowing down,&quot; says MarkSteinkrauss, investor relations director.   Digital and other major computer makers will be generallyless affected by currency swings than IBM because theytypically employ six-month hedging contracts to smooth outthe currency fluctuations.   Amdahl Corp., a major IBM competitor in the mainframearea, issued a news release yesterday saying that it, too,was seeing economic weakness, especially in Europe. AlthoughAmdahl had already lowered analysts' expectations once thisquarter, the release said the additional problems meanfirst-quarter earnings will be &quot;well below last year'sfirst-quarter level and analysts' expectations.&quot;   Unisys Corp., which some analysts label a candidate fortrouble because its product line and geographic spread mirrorIBM's, has previously said it saw problems in Europe.Yesterday, a company spokesman wouldn't go beyond that.   Some other mainframe and minicomputer firms remain upbeat.Hitachi Data Systems, a maker of mainframes and high-end diskdrives, says demand remains strong. A Hewlett-Packard Co.spokesman says &quot;nothing in our February data would indicateanything out of the ordinary.&quot; Stratus Computer Inc., whichspecializes in the fast-growing market for fault-tolerantcomputers, says business remains steady.   But Wang Laboratories Inc. is more cautious, saying, &quot;It'sevident the U.S. recession, weakening world economy, the Gulfcrisis and an overall sluggishness in the market for midrangesystems present new challenges for our turnaround efforts.Some of the company's strongest markets have been hit hardestby adverse economic conditions,&quot; especially banking andinsurance.   Companies in the personal-computer and workstationindustries, such as Apple and Intel, are more optimistic.Advanced Micro Devices, a semiconductor company, says itsbook-to-bill ratio in February was even better than the verystrong indicator of future sales released last week by theSemiconductor Industry Association. &quot;If you listen to thisindustry and to IBM, you wouldn't think you were reading outof the same book,&quot; says Ben Anixter, Advanced Micro Devices'vice president of external affairs.   PC software sales appear to have stayed strong, especiallyat industry leader Microsoft Corp. Lotus Development Corp.says international markets are good, though it acknowledgesthat sales in the U.S. and Canada &quot;remain sluggish.&quot;   Still, personal-computer maker Compaq Computer Corp. hassaid that it finds the economic climate difficult, that theU.S. is in especially rough shape and that its first quarterwill be difficult. Tandy Corp., another big personal-computercompany, says, &quot;We're not looking at anything like {IBM'sproblems} for this quarter, although there could be someweakness.&quot;   In Europe, IBM rivals confirm that the once-hot computermarket is continuing to cool off, though none have reportedany dramatic worsening in the first quarter. French computermaker Groupe Bull says its own European sales in the firstquarter are exceeding expectations.   A spokesman for International Computers Ltd., a Britishaffiliate of Japan's Fujitsu Ltd., says that &quot;there is a bitof a recession going on&quot; in parts of the European computermarket. He adds that the market's total growth rate shouldslow to 5% in 1991 from 7% to 8% last year. But he says theslowdown had long been anticipated, allowing companies toplan for it.   A first-quarter survey by research firm International DataCorp. found computer companies around Europe lowering theirgrowth forecasts by one or two percentage points. Whilepersonal computer sales grew 50% or more a year in themid-1980s, IDC sees the total European computer marketgrowing just 4.6% this year, after adjustment for inflation,down from 5.7% last year.   For IBM, its announcement was a large meal of crow. In aconference call to analysts in January on IBM's triumphantfourth-quarter earnings, the company's investor-relationsdirector closed the call by dedicating it to all the doubtersamong the analysts. He had some backtracking to do yesterday.   The announcement meant analysts slashed their IBMestimates to 85 to 95 cents for the first quarter, down fromthe year-earlier $1.04 billion, or $1.81 a share. For theyear, estimates dropped to $9.30 to $10 a share, from $11.Earnings in 1990 were $6.02 billion, or $10.51 a share.   Analysts generally accepted IBM's explanation thateconomic weakness was the cause of its trouble. But some alsopointed to problems that belong almost entirely to IBM. Forone thing, IBM is in the midst of a tricky product transitionin its mainframe line. It announced last September somepowerful machines that won't be available until the secondhalf, and customers sometimes stop buying machines while theydecide whether to purchase the new technology. IBM reiteratedyesterday that the transition is going smoothly.   The company also is facing problems in high-end diskdrives, an area that rivals its mainframe line inprofitability. IBM began shipping a new generation of diskdrives in late 1989 and had the field pretty much to itselflast year as competitors had trouble matching its technology.But Hitachi Data Systems, which has even a better record forreliability than IBM in this area, began shipping a rivalproduct last month. Other competitors are expected to followsoon, so prices and price margins should tumble.   IBM said yesterday that it has accelerated plans to cutcosts, and it may be able to announce some job reductions yetthis month. It is expected to complete the sale soon of itslaser-printer, typewriter and office-products operations, andit confirmed yesterday that it would probably use the gainfrom that sale to offset some sort of restructuring charge.   ---   Staff reporters John R.
