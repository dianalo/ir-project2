HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Researchers today reported the first ``verypromising'' evidence outside a test tube that an experimental newtreatment will slow the lethal spread of the AIDS virus inside thebody.   The medicine, CD4, apparently works as a decoy, mimicking theblood cells that the virus usually infects and kills.   In a report in today's journal Nature, researchers reported thatthe treatment dramatically reduced the level of virus in monkeysinfected with the simian version of the AIDS virus.   ``This is the first evidence in vivo (in a living animal) that ithas anti-viral effects with chronic administration in a relevantanimal model,'' said Dr. Robert Schooley of Massachusetts GeneralHospital.   ``That still leaves the question of whether or not there will beparallel positive effects in humans,'' he said. ``But it doesincrease the enthusiasm and the likelihood one would push on withmore extensive studies.''   Recently, Schooley and others began testing CD4 on peopleinfected with HIV, the human AIDS virus, but the results will not beknown for weeks.   ``This approach looks very promising for AIDS,'' said Dr. NormanL. Letvin, senior author of the monkey study.   The treatment cannot wipe out the virus when hidden inside thebody's cells. However, if it works as researchers hope, it willabsorb loose virus that is roaming the bloodstream looking for newcells to take over.   The latest research, conducted at the Harvard-affiliated NewEngland Regional Primate Research Center, suggests that CD4 will dojust that. It showed that when given to infected rhesus monkeys, thedrug dramatically reduced levels of the virus.   The monkeys were infected with simian immunodeficiency virus ofmacaques, or SIV, a close relative of the virus that causes acquiredimmune deficiency syndrome in humans. Monkeys that catch SIV growsick and die of an illness that closely mirrors human AIDS.   Even if the treatment works as well in people as it does inmonkeys, it will not cure AIDS. But it might make life better forvictims of the virus.   ``What one would predict on the basis of these monkey studies isthat if the drug is well tolerated in humans, there is every reasonto hope that patients should live significantly longer and feelsignificantly better,'' Letvin said.   Researchers tested CD4 on six monkeys. Two were healthy, and thedrug had no adverse effects on them. The four others had beeninfected for more than a year and had varying stages of disease.   ``The animals showed a very dramatic response when we looked atour ability to isolate virus from them during and immediatelyfollowing treatment,'' Letvin said.   The infected animals received daily injections of CD4 for 50days. Virus in their blood and bone marrow largely disappearedwithin two weeks of the start of treatment and returned after thetreatment stopped.   The animals' marrow, which makes blood cells, also regainedstrength during the treatment, an effect that Letvin said wassurprising.   The sickest of the four died of severe anemia after the treatmentstopped. Letvin said that anemia is sometimes caused by the disease,but the researchers could not rule out the possibility that it wasalso triggered by the treatment.   CD4 is a natural molecule that's found on the surface of someblood cells. Among these are the chief victims of the AIDS virus _scavenger cells called macrophages and helper T cells thatcoordinate the body's response to infections.   When the AIDS virus gets into the body, it is attracted to cellsthat carry CD4. The virus locks onto the CD4 and worms its wayinside. Then it takes over the cell, eventually turning into afactory to make more virus.   The new drug is a soluble form of CD4 made through geneticengineering. Theoretically, it provides so many targets for thevirus that it is lured harmlessly away from uninfected cells.   Letvin's monkey research and Schooley's human testing is beingdone with a form of CD4 made by Biogen Inc., a biotechnology firm inCambridge, Mass. Human testing has also begun with CD4 made byGenentech in South San Francisco.</TEXT></DOC>
