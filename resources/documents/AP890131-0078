The three main opposition parties accused the government ofcovering up the wrongdoings of Chun, who is a friend of PresidentRoh Tae-woo and former classmate at military college. Oppositionleaders said they will work to seek the appointment of a specialprosecutor to thoroughly investigate alleged wrongdoing by Chun, hisfamily and associates.   In a report ending nearly a year of investigation, theprosecution said 47 people have been arrested, including 13 membersof Chun's family, a former government intelligence chief, two formerCabinet ministers, a ruling party lawmaker and a former Seoul mayor.   Senior prosecutor Park Chong-chul announced the report's findingsand said 20 other people have been booked for indictment but notdetained. Trial dates have not been set.   Those arrested and indicted are charged with embezzlement andabuse of authority for personal gain. But none was accused ofraising illegal political funds for Chun _ a main complaint voicedby the opposition.   Prosecutor-General Kim Ki-choon said the investigation wasconducted in a ``neutral and independent manner,'' but oppositionparties said the results fall far short of public expectations.   Rep. Lee Sang-soo, spokesman for the largest opposition Party forPeace and Democracy, charged the prosecution took its cue from RohTae-woo and did not look into Chun's alleged wrongdoings.   Chun, 58, left office last February. He has denied any personalcorruption, but surrendered $24 million in illegal political fundsbefore going into rural exile.   Radical students and dissidents have demonstrated frequently inrecent months, demanding Chun be punished for alleged corruption andhuman rights violations.</TEXT></DOC>
