Japan, the biggest donor, announced a pledge of about $1 billionin easy-term loans and grants and said it was considering a separateloan of $600 million to help service the Philippines' $28 billionforeign debt.   The United States says it will add $200 million this year to itsprevious commitment of $458.6 million.   The 12-nation European Economic Community said it would roughlytriple its aid to the level of about $350 million a year.   ``We are grateful for the positive and enthusiastic response ofthe international community to this unique effort to help us,''Roberto Villanueva, aid coordinator in the Philippines, said after athree-day meeting of 20 countries and seven internationalorganizations.   A statement issued by the World Bank, which organized themeeting, said the donors ``complimented the (Manila) government onthe remarkable economic recovery achieved in the past three yearsand endorsed the government's policy objectives as presented.''   The aid commitment is double the level that resulted from thelast donors' meeting in 1987, the World Bank said.   If carried through 1992, it would mean $14 billion to helpPresident Corazon Aquino's government deal with pervasive problemsof poverty, poor infrastructure and a foreign debt legacy left fromthe 20-year authoritarian rule of Ferdinand Marcos.   The United States, former ruler in the Philippines and nowpossessor of major military bases there, originated the idea for thePhilippines Multilateral Aid Initiative. Secretary of State James A.Baker III said in Tokyo Tuesday it was ``critical to the future ofPhilippine democracy.''   The World Bank did not release details of other donors'commitments, most of which would come from the bank itself or otherglobal institutions like the International Monetary Fund, saidJapanese analyst Katsumi Nozawa.   Nozawa said that in addition to supporting democracy and economicreform, the aid package would bolster Western strategic interests inthe Philippines. The current U.S.-Philippines agreement on key U.S.air and naval bases there expires in late 1991.   All sides officially say no link exists between aid andcontinuation of the bases, but ``there is a de facto link,'' saidNozawa, a Philippines specialist at the Institute for DevelopingEconomies, a think tank supported by the Ministry of InternationalTrade and Industry.   The Philippines' 1989-92 economic recovery plan also coincideswith the end of Mrs. Aquino's term as president, Villanueva noted.   He said no conditions were set on debt-relief measures, but heacknowledged that Manila now must show improved performance inutilizing aid, a concern that was stressed by Japanese, Americansand others at the conference.   Villanueva said a system of checks and balances was in place toguard against corruption and mismanagement _ areas that long havebeen problems in delivering aid to the Philippines.   The Philippines' deputy finance Secretary, Ernest Leung, toldreporters work now could start soon on electric power and roadprojects, and that the conference result would help back a fisheriesloan and give other fiscal support.   Poverty now afflicts 49 percent of the people in the Philippines,according to official standards. If the aid reduces poverty, it mayeventually lower the strength of the communist-led insurgents whohave fought for 20 years to overthrow the government.   The 20 countries represented at the Tokyo meeting were Australia,Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Finland, West Germany,Italy, Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands, New Zealand, thePhilippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland andthe United States.   International organizations included the World Bank, the AsianDevelopment Bank, the European Economic Community, the InternationalMonetary Fund, the U.N. Development Fund, the International FinanceCorporation and the U.N. International Cultural and Educational Fund.</TEXT></DOC>
