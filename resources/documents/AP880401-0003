The move was being taken ``in view of the growing unrest andtension'' in Panama, and should not be read as an indication of``some kind of military action on the part of the United States,''the Pentagon said.   However, CBS News reported Friday night that the Reaganadministration was ``considering a plan to overthrow'' Panamanianstrongman Manuel Antonio Noriega, although the network said nodecision has been made and the Pentagon opposes such a proposal.   There are already more than 10,000 U.S. troops in Panama.   While many of the troops to be dispatched are military policeand other security specialists, Army helicopter units also arebeing deployed to the troubled Central American country, thePentagon said. The deployment will begin next week, the Pentagonsaid.   The move comes just one week after the Defense Departmentcompleted a buildup that had already doubled the number of securitypersonnel guarding military bases in Panama. It also comes fourdays after Panamanian troops marched on a Panama City hotel,confiscating the tapes of four U.S. television networks and brieflydetaining several American journalists.   CBS News reported Friday night that the Reagan administrationwas considering a proposal, advanced by the State Departmentearlier this week, ``to overthrow Noriega by triggering a newpolitical crisis'' which would require the dispatching of twoinfantry brigades, or 8,000 combat troops, into Panama.   No decision has been made, the network said, noting that such aplan is opposed by Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci and Adm.William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.   The Los Angeles Times reported in Saturday editions thatSecretary of State George P. Shultz and Assistant Secretary ofState Elliott Abrams proposed a series of actions, includingkidnapping Noriega to bring him to the United States for trial,landing more than 3,000 troops in Panama in a show of force andusing the CIA to organize a military coup.   The newspaper reported that the proposals had been advanced athigh-level meetings, and that the kidnapping plan, which startledother officials, had been shelved as unworkable. But the idea offomenting a coup remained under consideration, the Times said. TheCIA has prepared a draft presidential authorization for limitedcovert action against Noriega, the newspaper reported.   Pentagon officials who demanded anonymity told The AssociatedPress late Friday that the decision to send the additional troopscame after a lengthy _ and vociferous _ debate within theadministration.   The sources confirmed that the State Department had urged thepresident to send an even larger contingent of troops to Panama,but that Carlucci had counseled greater caution.   The sources refused to say whether the State Department wantedextra troops in Panama to mount a military operation directlyagainst Noriega, or rather thought there was more of a threat toAmericans in the country.   State Department spokesman Rudy Boone said there was no commenton the CBS report. ``We have nothing on that,'' he said. WhiteHouse spokesman Ben Jarratt also said he had no information on thereport.   The Pentagon denied any plans to send more troops into Panama.It described the upcoming troop movement as part of a continuingeffort ``to enhance our security posture there.''   ``The instability of the current situation in Panama; theheavy-handed tactics of Noriega in dealing with the situation, andthe potential for increased threats to U.S. citizens and interestsin Panama make this deployment essential at this time to ensure thecontinued safety of U.S. personnel and facilities.''   The Defense Department's prepared statement did not elaborate onwho or what would be protected. But a ranking Pentagon officialsaid the troops ``will not be restricted to providing security atour bases.''   ``They will be able to go where they are needed to protectAmericans,'' said the official, who requested anonymity.   ``This action is consistent with the Panama Canal Treaty and isa reasonable and prudent effort to further safeguard the canal andU.S. lives, property and interests in the area,'' the Pentagon'sstatement said.   The Pentagon said the buildup would be gradual, with the firstcontingent of troops leaving the United States next Tuesday.   ``This augmentation of U.S. Southern Command's security forces... is expected to be completed by Friday, April 8, 1988. Furtherdeployments will depend on circustances,'' the statement said.   The units being sent to Panama include an Army battalion ofmilitary police; a reinforced company of Marines; three Air ForceAir Base Ground Defense Units; two additional guard dog squads andan Army aviation task force, the Pentagon said.   The aviation unit will include seven AH-1 Cobra helicoptergunships along with 15 UH-60 Blackhawk transports and four OH-58Kiowa observation copters, the Pentagon said.   ``The aircraft are to provide rapid transportation and highlymobile protection for the security forces if necessary,'' thePentagon said.   The U.S. Southern Command, which has its headquarters in Panama,had about 600 security personnel among the 10,000 servicemenassigned to it before the United States stepped up its campaignearly last month to oust Noriega.   Over a 10-day period that ended on March 24, the Pentagondispatched another 670 security personnel to Panama for the statedpurpose of protecting military facilities.   Besides the servicemen assigned to the Southern Command, thereare about 13,000 military dependents in Panama along with another1,300 U.S. employees of the Panama Canal Commission and their 2,600dependents.   The Pentagon said Friday that Crowe, the Joint Chiefs chairman,had recommended additional security personnel be dispatched toPanama ``in view of the growing unrest and tension.''   Carlucci and President Reagan subsequently agreed and the orderwas given, the Pentagon said, adding the deployments should not beread as portending ``some kind of military action on the part ofthe United States.''   ``It is simply a prudent move to enhance security,'' thePentagon said.   The Defense Department said the Army MPs would be drawn fromFort Meade, Md., and Fort Bragg, N.C., while the Army helicopterunit would come from the 7th Light Infantry Division at Fort Ord,Calif.   The Marine company will be dispatched from Camp Lejeune, N.C.The Pentagon said it was not prepared Friday to say where the AirForce ground defense units would deploy from.</TEXT></DOC>
