The McLean, Va.-based electrical contracting and technical services company didn't give details about the proposals, and its officials couldn't be reached for comment last night.    As reported earlier this month, investors led by DynCorp's chairman withdrew a proposal to take the company private for $24 a share, or about $270 million. DynCorp then said it would still solicit bids. </TEXT></DOC>
