Box 1396, Houston, Texas 77251, filed in Docket No. CP88-328-002a petition to amend the order issuing a certificate of public convenienceand necessity pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act in Docket No.CP88328-000, by authorizing Transco and the holders of firm transportationcapacity on its system to sell, trade or reassign those rights and sell,trade or reassign Transco's firm transportation and exchange capacity rightson other interstate pipelines to each other or to third parties in an unregulatedsecondary market, all as more fully set forth in the petition which ison file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Specifically, Transco seeks authority necessary to permit Transco and theholders of firm transportation capacity rights on its system to sell, tradeor reassign those rights, and to sell, trade or reassign Transco's firmtransportation and exchange capacity rights on other interstate pipelines,to each other or to third parties in an unregulated secondary market. Transcoalso seeks additional authorizations which would become necessary if Transco'sproposals in its currently pending rate case in Docket No. RP87-7-000 areaccepted. Transco states that such other authority would be (i) that Transcobe permitted to terminate its current Rate Schedule IT and all other interruptibletransportation services that it performs under its FERC Gas Tariff andabandon service thereunder (Transco believes that this is necessary becauseall transportation service would be provided by Transco under firm transportationagreements or by reassignment in an unregulated secondary market), and(ii) that Transco be authorized to maintain its current CD and G/OG salesservice by providing such service on an unbundled basis pursuant to RateSchedule FT for the pricing of the transportation component and referenceto the purchased gas adjustment mechanism or any subsequently authorizedgas inventory charge for pricing of the gas commodity. Transco further requests that the Commission consolidate this petitionwith the ongoing proceeding in Docket No. RP87-7-000 in order that theissues raised by this petition may be considered and addressed in conjunctionwith the Docket No. RP87-7-000 proposal upon which this petition is saidto be a necessary component. Transco states that the rate design and termsof service which Transco has proposed in Docket No. RP87-7-000 are closelyintertwined with the secondary market proposal authorization which is soughtby this filing. Transco proposes that essentially all current capacity on the system usedto render pipeline merchant service would be assigned to the existing customers.Transco proposes to define the rights FT shippers hold so as to ensurethat firm transportation entitlements provide service to the customer thatis comparable regardless of the customer's choice of marketers to provideits gas supply. To accomplish this, it is necessary to provide enhancedfirm capacity entitlements that include access to Transco's entire productionarea and to Transco's upstream firm transportation and exchange rightson third party pipelines traditionally used by Transco to purchase specificgas supplies for firm sales service. As to capacity rights, Transco states it would allocate firm capacity rightson its traditional mainline to firm sales and transportation customersconsistent with Transco's existing contractual service obligations. Thiswould be accomplished by converting any remaining traditional firm salesentitlements of customers to firm transportation entitlements. These newFT customers, and any existing FT customers by virtue of prior contractconversions or the reallocation of firm sales or transportation mainlinecapacity (these new and existing FT customers are referred to collectivelyas FT conversion customers) would have full daily contract capacity rightson Transco's mainline transmission system commencing at Compressor Station65. Existing firm transportation customers under Transco's four certificatedlong haul X Rate Schedules (X-11, 42, 52 and 56) would retain their existingcontractual entitlements to capacity and Transco would retain firm capacityon its mainline system needed to render service under Rate Schedules PSand ACQ, or any successor services. Transco would be allocated a percentage of the capacity upstream of Station65 in order to provide service under existing Rate Schedules PS and ACQand for certificated long-haul firm transportation, and to provide forfuel and for the operational flexibility to respond on short notice tochanges in flow patterns on its system. When that capacity is not necessaryfor such purposes, Transco would offer such capacity for sale in the unregulatedsecondary market. Transco would include rights under certain firm transportationand exchange agreements with upstream pipelines in the allocation process.In effect, Transco states it proposes to treat its rights on upstream pipelinesas an extension of its own system. With regard to delivery points, Transco states that each FT conversioncustomer would have firm transportation service rights to receive gas atthat customer's traditional delivery points with Transco. With regard toreceipt points, Transco proposes that all gas supply and third-party pipelineinterconnect receipt points on Transco's pipeline system would be availableto FT conversion customers under Rate Schedule FT. Transco states it has proposed in Docket No. RP87-7-000 to establish conditionsand rates for regulated firm transportation service on its system whichwould permit the creation of an unregulated secondary market in such transportationrights. Transco is herein proposing first to convert its system to unbundledfirm transportation service by allocating capacity to Transco's historicfirm customers consistent with Transco's existing contractual obligations.Transco asserts that this allocation of firm capacity in combination withTransco's proposed rate design and tariff changes in the Docket No. RP87-7-000proceeding would create the conditions necessary and sufficient for theoperation of the unregulated secondary market. Transco states that the agreements governing the sale or assignment ofcapacity rights in the proposed unregulated market would be the productof negotiation between the buyers and sellers in that market. Transco statesit would not be a party to those agreements, except to the extent thatTransco itself is either a buyer or a seller in the unregulated market.Transco asserts it would conduct business with the FT customers under theRate Schedule FT and would look to the FT customer as the party responsiblefor the payment of any and all charges associated with the use of the capacityunder that rate schedule and for compliance with the other terms and conditionsof Transco's tariff. <T3>Comment date: </T3>July 27, 1989 in accordance with Standard ParagraphF at the end of the notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">29.
