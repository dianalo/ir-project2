A Foreign Ministry statement Thursday and a televised interviewwith a government spokeswoman stressed that Poland has notabandoned its treaty obligations to East Germany to send back toits communist neighbor any East German citizens caught trying toenter Poland illegally.   But in practice, the policy appears to apply only to those EastGermans apprehended while trying to cross the border, not EastGermans who make it deeper into Poland.   Foreign Minister Krysztof Skubiszewski said in an interviewpublished Thursday that he opposes deportations, whether the EastGermans are legal or illegal, while a border commander said earlierthat if East Germans make it to the interior of Poland, then thatis their ``luck.''   Nevertheless, the government reacted quickly to an article inthe pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza suggesting that Polandwill no longer oppose East Germans entering the country illegally.   Both government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska and theForeign Ministry said Poland still opposes illegal entries. Ms.Niezabitowska made the statement in a television appearanceWednesday night, while the Foreign Ministry published its statementThursday.   According to the Foreign Ministry statement, troops guardingPoland's frontiers have the duty of ``counteracting illegal bordercrossings.''   It added that repeated and widely publicized promises bySkubiszewski that no refugees would be deported against their will``concern people who find themselves in Poland legally.''   The Foreign Ministry statement, apparently designed to assuageEast German concerns, was conveyed to the East German public byEast Germany's state news agency ADN.   For practical purposes, however, East Germans who successfullycross the border area by swimming the Oder and Neisse rivers orwalking across the frontier are not being interfered with by Polishofficials, one border commander said.   ``Obviously if someone succeeds in crossing the border and getsdeeper into Polish territory, then it is his luck and we do notcare about him,'' said Gen. Feliks Stramik, of the Military BorderGuard, interviewed by The Associated Press on Wednesday.   Skubiszewski, in an interview Thursday in Gazeta Wyborcza, notedthat all over the world people who enter a country illegally areliable to deportation.   ``But that is not the point,'' the foreign minister said. ``Istill believe that deportations should not be taking place. I havetried hard to prevent them.''   Without specifying his efforts, he said his aim was to solve theproblem ``in accordance with Poland's duties in the field of humanrights but also in accordance with the interests of the state.''   He said state interests ``should be handled so as to avoidharming the individual.''   Mazowiecki's government has several reasons to be sensitive tothe concerns of East Germany.   When it took power as the first non-communist government in theEast bloc, it gave assurances that Poland would continue to respectforeign policy commitments within the Warsaw Pact.   Also, East Germany spans the direct roads between Poland andWestern Europe, and East German authorities could easily play havocwith Polish tourism and commerce.   Skubiszewski pointed to the fact that many Poles are employed inEast Germany ``and we must also take their interests into account.''   Poland has taken a tolerant view to the 600 East Germans whohave made their way to the West German Embassy in Warsaw in thepast week. Unlike their counterparts in Czechoslovakia, therefugees have not been forced to reside on the embassy grounds butinstead in vacation hotels.   Both the Roman Catholic church and the Polish Red Cross havebeen active in caring for the refugees.   Two trainloads carrying more than 1,400 refugees were allowed toleave Poland for West Germany last week with the agreement of theEast German government.</TEXT></DOC>
