Carlucci departsThursday on a Soviet trip expected to include unprecedented visitsto air, ground and naval bases, although a senior U.S. officialexpressed chagrin Tuesday that Moscow had not set the exactschedule.   During four days in the Soviet Union, Carlucci will meet hisSoviet counterpart, Gen. Dmitri Yazov, to continue discussions onreducing military tension between the superpowers.   But Carlucci will not be drawn into discussions of conventionaland nuclear arms control issues that U.S. officials say should beconducted in established and ongoing negotiations involvingdiplomats from the United States and its allies in the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization.   ``The Soviet Union frequently tries to engage various parties ingovernment and out of government as surrogate negotiators in thearms control area,'' a senior U.S. official said.   ``We are not there to negotiate arms control agreements ... orto play these kind of games,'' said the official, who spoke oncondition he not be further identified.   Despite the tough talk, Pentagon officials were looking forwardto a visit they hoped would provide their first close look atSoviet bases since World War II.   ``We find it useful to have greater access to the Soviet Union,not only to tell our story, but to see for ourselves firsthand thetypes of leadership they have and their approach to militaryissues,'' the official said.   Carlucci, accompanied by Assistant Defense Secretary Ron Lehman,representatives of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and State Department,and a planeload of other officials, was to depart Andrews Air ForceBase on Thursday for Helsinki, Finland. There they will meet withFinnish President Mauno Koivisto and other officials beforearriving in Moscow on Monday for the talks.   After departing the Soviet Union next Thursday, Carlucci willfly to Turkey for meetings with Turkish President Kenan Evren,Prime Minister Turgut Ozal and senior defense officials.   He was to visit Ankara, Istanbul and a NATO base at Izmir beforereturning to Washington on Aug. 8.   In Moscow, Carlucci was expected to visit the Frunze GeneralStaff Military Academy, the Kubinka Air Base about 30 miles west ofthe Soviet capital and the base of the Tuman division, part of theSoviet ground forces. He is expected to fly to Sevastopol on theCrimean Peninsula on Wednesday to look at elements of the Black Seafleet.   At the beginning of July, Soviet Chief of Staff Marshal SergeiAkhromeyev took a tour of U.S. facilities that included a closeview of flight operations on the aircraft carrier USS TheodoreRoosevelt and a look inside a B-1 bomber and a Minuteman missiletraining facility.   In return, U.S. officials let it be known that they wanted tosee a Soviet Blackjack bomber and visit Soviet ships at sea.   ``We understand that ... (Carlucci) will go out on the BlackSea. But we have not heard the details as to whether that will beon a combat vessel or on a ferry boat,'' the official said.   U.S. officials said they did not know whether the Soviets wouldallow reporters and photographers to accompany Carlucci during hisvisit. Such coverage was permitted for parts of Akhromeyev's trip.   A senior Pentagon official who discussed the trip with reporterscomplained that the Soviets had not given Carlucci an exactitinerary.   ``Generally, when we are going there, the details of theschedule are often left until the last few minutes,'' the officialsaid.   ``While we went out of our way to make sure that everything weshowed Akhromeyev was unclassified ... he saw real equipment andreal troops. ... He saw the real world. What we are looking for isthe real world, not a rigid display or a Potemkin village,'' theofficial said.   Carlucci will ask Yazov more about the Soviets' highlypublicized doctrine of ``defensive sufficiency,'' which the Kremlinsays precludes the offensive use of military forces.   ``When Marshal Akhromeyev came here last time, he indicated hewould answer all of our questions. Let me say, it is not clear thathe answered any of our questions,'' said the official. ``So far, wehave seen no changes in Soviet force posture, production ormilitary spending.''   Carlucci also will press the Soviets to move ahead on anagreement announced on July 11 between Akhromeyev and the chairmanof the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William Crowe, to set up aworking group to discuss ways of avoiding dangerous militarysituations.   And he will try to nail down specifics of an agreement announcedby Akhromeyev and Crowe for the exchange of visits by warships,professors at military academies and senior staff and fieldcommanders.</TEXT></DOC>
