The victims included Kaneb Services, a Houston oil services company, First City Bancorp. of Texas, a Houston bank holding company, Apache Petroleum, a loss-ridden energy partnership, and Dallas-based MCorp, one of the largest Texas bank companies.    In addition, McLean Industries, a major operator of ocean cargo-vessels that was hurt by both overcapacity in the shipping industry and the drop in oil prices, became the second-biggest loser of the quarter when it filed for bankruptcy-law protection in November.    The biggest loser, Wedtech, down 94%, filed for bankruptcy-law protection Dec. 15 amid federal and state investigations of its success in obtaining no-bid Defense Department contracts available to minority-owned businesses. Wedtech recently conceded it isn't any longer minority-owned or controlled.    On the other hand, two of the quarter's best performers popped up on the list because they are trying to emerge from bankrupcty-law proceedings. They are Cook United, a discount retailer, which became the top stock by gaining 193%, and Storage Technology, a data-storage equipment maker.    Another factor that fueled several stock run-ups was the prospect of a takeover, restructuring or asset disposition.    A big holder raised his stake in Smith International, a drill equipment company. Wurlitzer sold a majority interest to an investor group. Purolator Courier began executing an asset-disposition plan even as an investor disclosed and then raised a big stake in the courier and filter company.    Joy Manufacturing is going private. An L.E. Myers investor is mulling a takeover. And Ranco anounced plans to be acquired.    Centronics Data Computer, eighth on the losers' list, had been expected to become an acquisition vehicle because some executives of Drexel Burnham Lambert own its stock. But that expectation faded after the Ivan Boesky scandal put the brakes on some takeover activity.    Proposed acquisitions accounted for the best-performing issues on the American Stock Exchange and in the over-the-counter market.    On the Amex, ACI Holdings, parent of AirCal, rose 81% in the quarter after AMR, which owns American Airlines, agreed to buy ACI. In the OTC market, AccuRay rose 180% when two companies made competing offers for the computer systems company.    But Webcor Electronics, a seller of telecommunications equipment that has defaulted on some debts, became the worst performer on the Amex, falling 72%, when a company that had planned to acquire 80% of Webcor ran into trouble with its own creditors.    The over-the-counter stock that declined the most was Chargit Inc., a credit card processing and telemarketing company, which filed for bankruptcy-law protection and fell 92%.    ---                   NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE                       Close            Net Issue                 12/31           Gain         %Chg.
