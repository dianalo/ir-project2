RoseStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/07/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> AEGAIRLINES (AIR) </IN><DATELINE> CHICAGO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a major restructuring of its United Airlines unit, Allegis Corp. will cut 250 management-level jobs and plans to trim the bureaucracy that reports to United's president and chief executive officer.    Sources at United said the departures would include at least five executives at the vice president level or above.    The outlines of United's plan were confirmed by a company spokesman. Among other things, it represents a further consolidation of the authority of Frank A. Olson, who last month was named chairman and chief executive of Allegis and president and chief executive of the United Airlines unit.    Mr. Olson has vowed to slash expenses of the carrier through management layoffs and other moves aimed at improving United's competitiveness in the airline industry. United's high cost structure has become an increasingly heavy burden in its continuing battle with such cut-rate carriers as Texas Air Corp.'s Continental Airlines unit.    In early February United dismissed 1,016, or about one-fourth, of its executive office employees. The spokesman said the latest cuts are part of an &quot;ongoing&quot; restructuring that will take place over the next two to three weeks.    &quot;A certain bureaucracy has built up here over the years,&quot; said the spokesman. &quot;This eliminates that bureaucracy. . . . We will become more action-oriented. That's what it takes to compete in the airline industry today.&quot;    The airline's units will be consolidated under five &quot;functional areas,&quot; the spokesman said, and the executives in charge of them will report directly to Mr. Olson. They are: marketing and planning, headed by John Zeeman, executive vice president; operations, headed by James Guyette, executive vice president; finance, led by Frank Jarc, senior vice president; law, headed by Edward Hoenicke, senior vice president and general counsel; and human resources, which will get an executive to be named later.    In addition, the spokesman said the western, eastern and central domestic geographic divisions will be eliminated in a further attempt to cut the corporate bureaucracy. He said those divisions manage United's regional airport divisions.    The spokesman said he couldn't &quot;confirm or deny&quot; that the cutbacks will mean the departure of five executives with the title of vice president or above.    The spokesman wouldn't say specifically what jobs or departments would be eliminated or go into further details on the management restructuring. But he said the idea is to allow &quot;lower-level managers to have more authority to deliver the product we're promising.&quot;    He said the company plans a closed-door briefing on the restructuring for analysts in New York tomorrow.    The moves to cut the airline's management are part of a plan announced last month by Allegis to sell its non-airline units and refocus on United. They are expected to be followed in coming months by efforts to get wage and benefit concessions from the airline's employee groups.    But the head of the machinists union has said his union would reject such requests, while officials of the pilots and flight attendants unions have said they would be inclined to make concessions only in return for majority ownership of the airline by its employees. </TEXT></DOC>
