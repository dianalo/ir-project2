L. 100-321and Pub. L. 100-322. A correction was published on page 733 of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of January 9, 1989. Interested persons were invitedto submit comments, suggestions, or objections by January 17, 1989. Threecomments were received.One commenter noted that should the amendments to andSection;andSection; 3.309and 3.111b (the latter having been published on pages 48551-48552 of the<T4>Federal Register</T4> of December 1, 1988) become final, five of the13 diseases that could be service-connected by presumption (lymphomas (exceptHodgkin's disease), and cancers of the pharynx, small intestine, bile ducts,and gall bladder) would not be considered to be ``radiogenic'' in andSection;3.311b(b)(2). It was suggested that the five diseases be added to the listof ``radiogenic'' diseases in andSection; 3.311b(b)(2) as there is soundscientific and medical evidence to do so.As the suggested additions to the list of ``radiogenic'' diseases are outsidethe scope of the original proposal and have not been subject to publiccomment, they will be given separate consideration. We will consult withthe Veterans' Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards and will considerwhether there is sound scientific and medical evidence to warrant our addingany or all of the five diseases to the list of ``radiogenic'' diseases.Should we conclude that any or all of the five should be ``radiogenic,''we will implement a new rulemaking procedure for the further amendmentof andSection; 3.311b(b)(2).Another commenter suggested that andSection; 3.309(d) be amended to includeparticipation in atmospheric nuclear tests conducted by nations other thanthe United States. We do not concur as the congressional intent expressedin the introductory paragraph to Pub. L. 100-321, in pertinent part, wasto provide a presumption of service connection to veterans who participatedin atmospheric or underwater nuclear tests as part of the United Statesnuclear weapons testing program. We have amended andSection; 3.309(d)(4)(ii)(A)to reflect such congressional intent.A third commenter suggested that the term, ``radiation-risk activity,''be amended to include the following: (1) Members of any crew aboard a shipor aircraft not assigned to the primary test site who participated in supportactivities related to the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons; (2) Membersof any military organization involved in the transportation, handling,maintenance, arming of nuclear weapons and/or investigation of nuclearaccidents; and (3) Any person who participated in human experimentationinvolving the use of any radioactive material. As to the first group, suchpersons are included in andSection; 3.309(d)(4)(iv). We do not concur withincluding the second and third groups as such persons' exposure is notincluded in the statutory definition of ``radiation-risk activity.''That commenter also referred to diseases, other than the 13 listed in Pub.L. 100-321, which should be included, and objected to the imposition ofmandatory latency periods. The commenter recognized, however, that VA cannotenlarge or expand upon statutory criteria, and stated such comments wereincluded ``to complete the record.''The same commenter also suggested that prisoners of war who were not internedwithin 75 miles of Hiroshima or 150 miles of Nagasaki, but who were forcedto work at factories within those areas at the time the atomic bombs weredropped on those cities, should be included in the regulation. We concurand have amended andSection; 3.308(d)(4)(vii) to include former prisonersof war who, while not interned within 75 miles of Hiroshima or 150 milesof Nagasaki, can affirmatively show they worked within those areas.Athough we received no comments regarding our proposed amendment of andSection;3.812, our review noted that section 1403 of Pub. L. 100-687 amended SubchapterII of Chapter 13, Title 38, United States Code, by adding section 418 andstriking out section 410(b). We are therefore making a technical amendmentto andSection; 3.812(c)(2) by deleting ``410(b)'' and inserting ``418.''We appreciate the comments and suggestions of those who responded to publicationof the proposed rules. The proposed rules are adopted with the amendmentsnoted above. The final rules are set forth below.The Secretary hereby certifies that these final regulations will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesas they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612.The reason for this certification is that these final regulations wouldnot directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries could bedirectly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these regulationsare exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirementsof sections 603 and 604.In accordance with Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation, we have determinedthat these final regulations are non-major for the following reasons:(1) They will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 millionor more.(2) They will not cause a major increase in costs or prices.(3) They will not have significant adverse effects on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.
