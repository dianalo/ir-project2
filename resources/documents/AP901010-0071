In other words, competition is the name of the game, andpractically every foreign grain exporter is swinging away.   For example, a report by the department's Foreign AgriculturalService included an article about the Canadian Wheat Board and itsguaranteed price to farmers in today's competitive world market.   ``With the recent precipitous decline in world wheat prices,attention is drawn to the role of export monopolies, such as theCanadian Wheat Board, and the extent to which guaranteed pricelevels to producers may have been overestimated, possibly requiringgovernment treasuries to cover resulting losses,'' the report said.   In many international markets, Canadian wheat must compete withprices established by subsidized wheat from the European Community.   Meanwhile, the board's initial payment to wheat farmers for No.1 Canadian Western Red Spring wheat of 13.5 percent protein wasabout $117 per metric ton in U.S. dollars.   But Canadian wheat on the world market is worth only about $69per ton. Therefore, the report said, the deficit of $48 per tonpresumably would have to be absorbed by the board.   ``Any losses being sustained by the Canadian Wheat Board onwheat exports could be offset by profits from sales executed beforethe recent price declines or by sales to commercial customers whopay premium prices for high-protein wheat,'' the report said.   Some other comments about the current grain situation:   -Brazil will need to import more wheat in 1990-91 because ofreduced domestic plantings, a crop shortfall and growingconsumption. Although Brazil has a supply agreement with Argentina,it may have to turn to other suppliers.   ``Canada, whose wheat trade agreement with Brazil ended in 1988,has been exporting wheat under an informal agreement,'' the reportsaid. ``Trade sources indicate that Canada has expressed aninterest in negotiation a new formal agreement but has insistedthat arrearage on past credit sales be paid first.''   -South Korea has been buying competitively priced feed-qualitywheat from the European Community. The low-quality wheat fromEurope already is displacing corn in the South Korea and could hurtU.S. exports of feed grain to that growing Asian market.   -Poland's wheat imports in 1990-91 are expected to drop to thelowest level in more than 20 years, mostly because of a record 1990harvest, diminished consumer subsidies and reduced livestockfeeding.   ``Typically, the EC has been the major supplier of wheat toPoland,'' the report said. ``However, lower import needs in Polandcould free additional EC supplies for shipments to other marketsand could increase competition for the United States.''   -In southern East Europe, greater demand for imports of coarsegrain has been spurred by harvest shortfalls in Yugoslavia andHungary, major corn-producing countries.   ---   WASHINGTON (AP) - Consumer prices for bananas peaked in Julybecause of a strike against Chiquita Brands Inc. by workers inHonduras, according to an Agriculture Department report.   The United States imported 2.92 million metric tons of bananasin 1989. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds.   In late June, a strike against Chiquita Brands ``significantlydisrupted'' shipments of Honduran bananas in July and August and``resulted in unseasonably high retail prices in U.S. markets,''the department's Economic Research Service said.   Total imports of bananas were up during the first six months ofthis year, including the period of the Honduran strike, as importsfrom Ecuador - the largest supplier - rose 36 percent from a yearearlier.   Between July 1 and Aug. 18, according to USDA trade figures,shipments of Honduran bananas to the United States dropped 54percent from a year earlier to only 27,034 tons.   The strike ``curtailed Honduran exports of about 108,000 metrictons over its seven-week duration,'' the report said. The UnitedStates accounts for more than 60 percent of the country's totalbanana exports, and Chiquita is the largest handler.   Meanwhile, U.S. banana prices, which usually soften with stiffercompetition from summer fruits, rose sharply in July as a result ofthe reduced supply from Honduras, the report said.   ``Although the impact was primarily on the East Coast, where thebulk of Honduran banana imports are sold, West Coast retail pricesalso reflected the market shortage,'' the report said.   In July, the U.S. retail banana prices reported by the LaborDepartment averaged 52.9 cents per pound, up 18 percent from June.   But with the end of the strike and more bananas in the market,prices dropped sharply in August, averaging 46.3 cents per poundnationally, a 13 percent drop from July.   ---   WASHINGTON (AP) - Trout farming is sharing in an expanded demandfor fish and other seafood, an annual report by the AgricultureDepartment shows.   Growers in 15 major trout-producing states had total sales offish and eggs of about $76.9 million during the year that endedAug. 31, according to the report. That was up 7 percent from $71.7million in 1988-89.   The sales included 59.9 million pounds of trout valued at $72.6million, and 349 million trout eggs worth $4.31 million.   An estimated 95 percent of the trout sold were food-size, thereport said. The average value was $1.14 per pound, up from $1.08the previous year.   Idaho was the leader in sales at about $33.1 million. Otherleading producers included California, $11.1 million; Pennsylvania,$6.14 million; North Carolina, $4.9 million; and Washington, $4.76million.</TEXT></DOC>
