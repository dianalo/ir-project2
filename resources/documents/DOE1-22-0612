<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-22-0612 </DOCNO><TEXT>A computerized system for the acquisition, storage and retrieval of subsurfacedata applicable to clastic sequences of the Lloydminster area of westernCanada is described. The system incorporates stratigraphic, lithologicand fluid data obtained from well logs. The data base is comprehensiveenough to permit that examination of lithologic sequences with repectto both external geometry and internal heterogeneities. Data are gatheredover large stratigraphic intervals, but at a detail near the verticallithologic resolution of the well logs employed. Information for stratigraphicmarkers contains a factor related to their ease of correlation, and allcorrelatable markers are assumed to represent chronostratigraphic surfaces.A complete suite of lithologic types is systematically obtained fromspontaneous potential well log traces; the resolution of lithologic informationis assumed to be two feet or .5 m. Fluid data (hydrocarbon and watercontent) are derived from resistivity logs by using arbitrary cut-offs.Standardized programs for data retrieval, manipulation and plotting areemployed. Following data acquisition, maps are plotted by computer usinggridding procedures. Some maps are displayed and compared with previouspublished examples, to demonstrate the ability of the system presentedhere to reproduce the works of others. The system presented offers arelatively objective, systematic and comprehensive appraoch to stratigraphicdata collection. 32 refs., 10 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
