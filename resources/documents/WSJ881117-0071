This time the U.S. better read the fine print. Otherwise it could end up consigning Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi to the wolves.    Cuba, Angola and South Africa have reached tentative agreement on a plan to give Namibia independence while 57,000 Cuban troops begin to leave neighboring Angola. The problem lies with the asymmetry in the timing of the two actions. Three months after the agreement is implemented early next year, 7,500 U.N. troops will be in Namibia and all but a handful of South Africans will be gone. However, only about a quarter of Cuba's troops will be out of Angola.    The Marxist Angolan regime recently promised to &quot;annihilate&quot; Mr. Savimbi's UNITA rebels. Next summer, with 35,000 Cuban troops still in Angola, they could move in for the kill. The agreement stipulates that Cuban troops can't move south into UNITA territory, but we can't help but notice that the Soviets, the Geneva accords in their pockets, are flying Backfire bombing raids against the Afghan mujahideen. Mr. Savimbi's supply routes are easily cut off, and the $15 million a year the U.S. provides is dwarfed by the $1 billion in arms the Soviets and Cubans gave the Angolans last year.    State believes the Angolans will agree to talks with Mr. Savimbi once an agreement is signed. Senator Dennis DeConcini and 50 colleagues (including 21 Democrats) aren't buying that. Last month they sent President Reagan a letter warning that &quot;the lessons of Afghanistan cannot be ignored in Angola.&quot; The Soviets now insist the Geneva treaty denies the U.S. any right to resupply the mujahideen. The Soviets continue to arm their puppet regime, and their troop withdrawals have been halted. The Senators called all this &quot;the consequences of a settlement that did not include indigenous resistance movements,&quot; and urged President Reagan to insist Mr. Savimbi be brought into the negotiations while the U.S. still has leverage.    If next year the Angolans are still bent on destroying Mr. Savimbi rather than talking with him, President Bush should consider supplying him with as much military aid as he needs. That may well be the only negotiating tactic the Angolans and their Cuban handlers respect. </TEXT></DOC>
