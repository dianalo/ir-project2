West German officials said the proposal eases NATO concerns thatthe territory would be considered a so-called rear area that couldsupply a Warsaw Pact advance. The proposal would limit a buildup offorces on the western Soviet border.   Czech delegate Ladislav Balcar proposed that the territory fromthe Atlantic to the Urals be divided into four zones involved inreductions of troops, tactical air force, helicopters, tanks,armored vehicles and artillery.   NATO officials said the East accepted the Western demand forinclusion of the Soviet Union's western military district in theCentral European zone. That Soviet district includes the Baltic,Transcarpathian and Byelorussian areas, which had been consideredrear areas.   The Warsaw Pact envisions the Central European zone as alsoincluding East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. NATOcountries in that area would be Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands,Luxembourg, West Germjany, France and Britain.   However, France and Britain have not been part of that zone sofar in the Western concept.   The North European zone would include the northern part of theLeningrad military zone and Norway. The Southern zone would consistof Romania, Bulgaria, the Odesssa, North Caucasian andTranscaucasian military zones, Italy, Greece, and Turkey.   The fourth or ``rear'' zone would include the southern part ofthe Leningrad military zone, the Moscow, Volga and Urals militaryzones, Spain, Portugal and Iceland.   The complex negotiations on conventional armed forces in Europeopened in March. The Warsaw Pact has a large edge over the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization in non-nuclear strength.   NATO proposed in March a limit of 12,000 tanks, 10,000 artillerypieces and 16,800 armored troop carriers for any one nation. Itwants weaponry stationed outside one's home country limited to 3,200tanks, 1,700 artillery pieces and 6,000 armored troop carriers ineach bloc.</TEXT></DOC>
