<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-39-1126 </DOCNO><TEXT>Features of fiber-reinforced metal (FRM) are first described, with a listingof the strength characteristics of various FRM and typical fibers forFRM. FRM is grouped into the long- and short-fiber types. Fibers withhigh strength have been developed for the long-fiber type FRM to be appliedto the aero-space and FRM research. Silica and alumina-silica are dominatingin the FRM development with short fibers. Typical production processesare described. Descriptions are given on the relationships between thehigh-temperature characteristics, tensile strength and fiber volume rate(Vf value), relationships between VF value and average fiber length,relationships between the fatigue strength and fiber orientation, mechanicalproperties, thermal properties and wear durability. Effectiveness ofapplication to pistons and con-rods are mentioned with some points tobe considered, trends in patents and future perspectives. Short fiberFRMs with the squeeze casting, is the principal product at present becauseof its high-cost performance. (13 figs, 16 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
