A $2.5 billion child-care bill introduced in Congress by Democratic Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Democratic Rep. Dale Kildee of Michigan would have established minimum national standards for the ratio of staffers to children in day-care centers, for training in child development and first aid, and for other health and safety areas. A Republican filibuster in the Senate this month killed the bill.    Children's advocacy groups intend to press their case in the next Congress. Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, says she questions the judgment of a nation that has &quot;no qualms&quot; about licensing hairdressers, restaurants and plumbers but not the people who care for children.    Standards are no guarantee of safety, says DeAnn Lineberry, an official of Virginia's Department of Social Services. But she says regulated care is still &quot;much less risky&quot; because it gives child-care providers rules to follow and gives parents more resources to deal with problems.    Others, however, argue that burdensome regulation would force many day-care providers out of business, while the survivors would have to increase their prices beyond the reach of many parents. Moreover, says Robert Rector, policy analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation, unlicensed child-care &quot;is far from being the onerous type of dangerous cesspool facility.&quot; He adds, &quot;It's one mother down the block who has a preschooler of her own, and is taking care of one other preschooler. . . . All the scientific evidence we have,&quot; shows that informal, unlicensed day-care is as safe as regulated care.    Most states require registration or licensing of some private homes that provide day care. But the Children's Defense Fund finds many exceptions. Of 46 states with some mandatory system, 37 don't regulate all homes. Thirty-two states require a criminal background check of the staff of day-care centers; four more check only child-abuse records. Twenty-six states either check or have plans to begin checking criminal records for family homes; an additional six check only abuse records. Only 13 states check the background of day-care staff through national FBI records.    Even among states that do check criminal records, there are gaping holes in the process. In Virginia, officials say, many cases of child abuse or neglect don't get to court and fail to appear in state police records of convictions related to crimes against children. And Virginia doesn't check out-of-state records. &quot;If someone was a mass murderer but all his victims were adults or all the crimes happened outside Virginia, it wouldn't show up,&quot; Ms. Lineberry says.    State regulations vary widely as well in requirements for training, staffing levels and the like -- which the Children's Defense Fund argues are just as important as criminal checks. The group says that 42 states don't require family day-care providers to receive training, and just 26 states insist that care givers in child-care centers have continuing training. Some states allow one adult to supervise a gaggle of babies: In South Carolina, a single baby sitter may care for as many as eight. In Idaho, one care giver may take responsibility for 12 children. </TEXT></DOC>
