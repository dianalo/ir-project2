It doesn'taugur well for anyone who thinks the city will have the moxie to shut down thefar bigger Garden City card club. Back in 1984, the San Jose policeinfiltrated the tiny five-table club in Alviso, arresting a dozen employees ongambling and drug violations after an eight-month undercover investigation.While the criminal case eventually resulted in a host of no-contest pleas, thepolice put their faith in the city attorney's office to begin action to revokeSutter's license.;   It's fair to say that Gallo sought to protect theinterests of her clients, the council members, who don't relish the circus ofa public hearing on card clubs, particularly on Garden City. In any case, oursources say Gallo's office allowed the file to grow moldy. For the record, thecity attorney kept giving assurances that revocation of Sutter's license wasunder review. &quot;The file is not closed,&quot; Gallo said in September 1988, afterSutter's had been allowed to incorporate. The next year, when Sutter's had tomove because of highway widening, she said, in great Yogi Berra fashion, &quot;Itwill be resolved when it's resolved.&quot; Finally, when our reporter Maline Hazlecalled her recently, Gallo 'fessed up, saying the case was finished. &quot;Adetermination was made that it wasn't appropriate to move forward,&quot; she said,declining explanation.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Perspective  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE BUCK STOPS HERE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The Insider  </MEMO><TEXT>  NAKED TRUTH; When our reporter Rod Foo did a story a month ago about the SanJose vice cops getting naked in the line of duty, one quote that literallyleaped off the page came from Deputy District Attorney Martina Hearn. Sayingthat prostitution cases were tainted by the police nudity, Hearn said, &quot;Youstart reading and you wonder, 'Who is the prostitute here?' &quot; Howeverintriguing the thought, the statement did nothing to smooth the relationshipbetween the police and the DA's office. As it happens, Hearn already had beenswitched to the district attorney's family support unit, widely regarded asthe Siberia of the office. Some in the justice community have interpreted thetransfer as a consequence of the quote. DA George Kennedy, however, says Hearnwas switched before the story appeared and not for punitive reasons. Kennedydoes acknowledge that he sent San Jose Police Officers Association presidentMike Fehr a letter of apology about the quote. &quot;It may be that Martina didn'tunderstand our policy of sticking to the facts and not stating opinions,&quot; hesaid.; THE FORMICA CARD; Correction Director Frank Hall may be gone, but hislegacy lives: Our sources say the county's correction department is nearly $3million short this year because it isn't generating the expected revenue fromhousing state and federal prisoners. This is a traditional moneymaker: Thestate and federal governments pay for temporary housing of their inmates.County Exec Sally Reed confirms that income is down, in part because of stateconfusion about whether the county intended to take more federal prisoners.But she says her staff believes the money can be made up. Our sources are lesshopeful. &quot;The whole thing fell apart while Hall was still there,&quot; said one.&quot;Nobody has done anything since. It's getting worse every month.&quot;; ANOTHERTANGO; Add one name to the short list of Democrats interested in running forthe Democratic nomination in the 12th Congressional District: former Palo AltoMayor Larry Klein. &quot;I'm considering it,&quot; Klein told us. &quot;I've been talkingwith people over the last week or two and I've been getting some positivefeedback. I'm not discouraged.&quot; Klein says much depends on the boundaries thatthe special judicial masters are expected to unveil Monday. If he jumps in, hewould probably be facing San Mateo County Supervisor Tom Nolan for theDemocratic nomination. Because the 12th -- now represented by U.S. Rep. TomCampbell -- is traditionally Republican, the Democrats face an uphill battleagainst the winner of the Charles Quackenbush-Tom Huening primary fight. ButKlein enjoys some name recognition: He might do well in liberal Republicanprecincts if Quackenbush is his opponent.; CHAMOIS TIME; And what willMilpitas City Council candidate Bob Livengood be doing on Election Day? Aftervoting for himself in the Dec. 10 special election, he'll wash Councilman SkipSkyrud's Chevy Blazer. Livengood picked the Atlanta Braves to win the WorldSeries. Skyrud, whose godson, Jeff Hermann, played youth baseball withMinnesota Twins pitcher Scott Erickson, took the Twins. The Twins won in sevengames. &quot;Bob will be doing the tomahawk chop with a sponge,&quot; Skyrud said. (box)  </TEXT><BYLINE>  The Insider is compiled by Mercury News reporters. Have a tip?
