The diagnosis items covered in the conventionalmanagement and inspection procedures for water channel structures includedeterioration, scouring/abrasion, cracking, displacement/deformationof encasement, leakage, and conditions of nearby features and mountains.The thickness of concrete encasement and the cavity behind the insidesurface of the encasement should be added to these items, in view ofthe fact that more than 80 percent of the penstock accidents are relatedwith the inside surface of the encasement for arched portions. A practicalway of evaluation is to classify and grade the results of each diagnosisitem before making an overall evaluation. Non-destructive inspectionshould be performed using several of the following: visual inspection,surface impact hardness testing, ultrasonic testing, optical testingand electromagnetic wave testing. The electromagnetic wave testing servesto accurately determine the changes in thickness of concrete encasementand the locations of cavities if the thickness is below the maximum transmissiondistance of electromagnetic waves.
