A government statement on the front pages of newspapers said athree-member government-appointed commission reported that 34people, including students, policemen and people living in the areaof the campuses, were injured in the March 12-17 violence.   The commission was headed by U Ba Maw, a member of the Councilof Peoples Justices, or the Supreme Court. The statement didn't saywhen the commission reported its findings to the government.   The riots at the Rangoon Institute of Technology and RangoonUniversity were the worst student disturbances in recent years inBurma, a tightly controlled nation under one-party rule.   The commission said 625 students were arrested.   Authorities hadn't previously given any figure for arrests andsaid only that one student died from unspecified causes when policequelled rioting at the Rangoon insitute on March 13.   ``The post-mortem revealed that the two students died of bulletsfrom 12-bore guns used by the police to disperse the crowd,''Saturday's announcement said. ``To minimize casualties, police used12-bore single barrel guns instead of the M-16 rifles with whichthey were armed.''   The announcement said that of the students arrested, 484 havebeen released and the others held for further investigation.   It said the violence began March 12 when students at the RangoonInstitute of Technology and local youths fought over which musiccassette they wanted played at a tea shop near the school.   Authorities arrested a local youth said to have been involved inthe melee but released him for lack of evidence, the announcementsaid. More clashes with local youths ensued the next day asstudents angered by the release hurled stones and set fire toseveral buildings.   It said riot police separated the 300 students and 300 localinhabitants, but the students, who had retreated inside the campus,began throwing stones at the police. The police retaliated withwater cannons, but the stone-throwing intensified.   The police then fired 14 tear gas bombs and six shots from12-bore guns, the announcement said. It said five students werestruck by gunshots. One student, Maung Phone Maw, a 23-year-oldengineering student, died on the spot while another student, MaungSoe Naing, died in the hospital on April 5.   The disturbances at the institute continued until March 15 whensecurity personnel took control of the campus and arrested 68students, it said.   It said that over the next two days, students at RangoonUniversity, ``instigated by political elements from the outside,''joined the unrest.   The announcement made no mention of March 18 rioting in downtownRangoon in which hundreds of students and others, demonstrating insupport of the students at the universities, shoutedanti-government slogans, smashed cars and set ablaze a governmentdepartment store.   That riot was quelled by security forces. There has been noofficial mention of arrests or casualties.</TEXT></DOC>
