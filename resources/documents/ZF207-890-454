(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Portable posingandM;I was delighted when the Samsung S5200 arrived for review a few days beforewe departed for our annual holiday in France.andP;  My idea of a holiday is to sitin the sun, far removed from telephones, writing programs and writing words.andO;In previous years I've used a beloved, ageing, Apricot portable; this yearthe Samsung travelled with us.andM;This is definitely a luggable, not a portable; a point emphasized by themains-only operation.andP;  It was uncomfortable to move around, but it did meanthat in operation the machine was as solid and stable as a normal AT.andP;  Itboasts a 12MHz 80286 and a 30Mb Seagate self-parking hard disk.andP;  It may beheavier than the Apricot, but it's much more impressive.andM;The first problems arose when I tried to run Microsoft Word 4.0.andO;Installation was fine, but as soon as I ran the program, the screen wentdead.andP;  Listening carefully, I could just hear the fan speed rise a little,which suggested that all the power to the screen had been cut off.andM;The complete blankness of the screen was a useful clue.andP;  My previous readingof the manual had revealed that an external monitor could be fitted and wassoftware toggleable.andP;  Plugging in a handy multi-sync monitor revealed Word inall its glory.andM;The software switching worked, and woke up the EGA gas-plasma screen on theSamsung.andP;  But when I tried the whole process without an external monitor itdidn't work.andP;  Running Word seemed to cause the signal to be diverted to thenon-existed monitor.andP;  The software toggle, however, was intelligent enough tolook for the external monitor and refused to switch either way if it wasn'tthere.andM;Several phone calls to a very helpful Samsung revealed that it was unaware ofthe problem, but would produce a fix as rapidly as possible.andP;  Apart fromthis, I failed to find any other incompatibility.andP;  I ran various languages onthe machine plus dBase and games; all have run without a hiccup, so themachine seems compatible enough.andM;The screen has two controls, brightness and contrast.andP;  The instructionssuggested that it was best run at full brightness and full contrast.andP;  Thisproviced a reasonable image for most purposes.andM;A TSR is provided which allows the user to toggle between different screenpalettes.andP;  Alt\ took me through a series of palettes with different screenintensities for different colours.andP;  Thus the white text on blue that I favourfor writing can appear as low-intensity orange on black, high-intensityorange on black or reverse video.andM;The keyboard was semi-tactile, there was no clean click as the keys go down,but rather a muted one.andP;  The key layout is a compacted AT style, functionkeys along the top, number/cursor keys on the right.andM;The most awkward thing about using the machine was the high edge at the frontof the keyboard.andP;  The keys almost felt as if they sloped away from me.andP;  Ifyou don't like the keyboard, an external one can be used; my Opus one seemedto work fine.andP;  Samsung have made this option hardware switchable -- pity theydidn't do the same for the screen.andM;The documentation was excellent, comprising a guide to operations, atechnical reference manual, an MS-DOS user/reference manual and a GW-BASICmanual.andM;One oddity of the machine was that at irregular intervals it made a littlegrumbling noise to itself.andP;  This sounded like the hard disk operating, butthe HDD run light didn't come on.andP;  It never seemed to do any harm, but was alittle unnerving at first.andM;The machine had two fans, but they weren't too noisy.andP;  A neat grey carryingbag with a should strap was included, but the Samsung itself didn't have ahandle, which meant that it was awkward to move around.andP;  There were two slots(one full, the other half length) in addition to the parallel and serialports (nine-pin) already provided.andM;Sanyo MBC 17LTandM;The Sanyo 17LT arrived after we came back from France.andP;  This is not acriticism of Sanyo's delivery system, since it was ordered later.andM;First impressions were that this was a more attractive machine.andP;  The case wasa rather sexy matt black.andP;  The indicator lights on the front panel (Caps, Numand Scroll lock, Disk Activity and Internal Keyboard) were tiny, brightpin-points which met with universal approval from my colleagues and myself.andO;Sensibly, the power light was mounted on the top of the case, and was visiblewhether the screen was up or down.andM;I though at first that there was no carrying handle, but finally found acleverly concealed and perfectly comfortable one tucked away under the frontof the keyboard.andM;One area in which the otherwise excellent design fell down was the keyboardlayout, which will seem cramped to the user of a PC or AT.andP;  The stretch from'L' to the Enter key was too long (across three keys); the cursor keys weretop right; Insert, Page Up and so on were all above the function keys.andM;This won't worry someone who's going to use this machine alone, but peoplewho bounce from machine to machine will find it tedious.andP;  The compression didallow the keyboard (and hence the whole machine) to be narrower, but I didn'tthink this slimming was worth the loss of a standard layout.andM;The key action was noticeably different.andP;  The keys seemed to fit in to theboard better and there was less sideways movement; this felt like a moreexpensive keyboard.andM;The first piece of software I loaded was Word, which ran without problems.andO;The external monitor can run at the same time as the LCD screen, orindependently.andP;  Sanyo has elected to make this switchable by DIP switches.andO;Before my experiences with the Samsung I might have complained these werefiddly, but now they suddenly seemed a sensible choice.andM;Next I loaded a game, Sentinel Worlds 1 from Electronic Arts.andP;  This hung upthe Sanyo.andP;  Well, games are notorious for this sort of thing, but Sentineldidn't hang the Samsung.andM;The screen on this machine was a backlit, supertwist LCD with a maximumresolution of 640x350.andP;  Two controls were provided, brightness and contrast.andM;In comparison to my ageing Apricot, this is a much better screen.andP;  LCDscreens are normally favoured because of their low power consumption.andP;  Inaddition, the Sanyo's screen was dogged by a rather long persistence, whichblurred text and generally added to eye fatigue.andP;  The Samsung's screen is arather garish shade of orange, but I found it infinitely preferable.andM;The Sanyo came with a 40Mb hard disk which had been partitioned as 2x20Mb.andO;This gave no trouble during the test period, but I was a little surprised todiscover that it wasn't self-parking.andP;  Parking the heads wasn't difficult,typing PARK did it.andP;  Unfortunately, the instructions for parking the harddisk are in the manual.andP;  I wonder how many Sanyos are going to be cheerfullycarried around for weeks with the hard disk unparked until the owner decidesto read the manual.andP;  A little sticker on the top of the machine would help.andM;The hard disk fitted to the test machine was slightly faster than that of theSamsung, which contrasted oddly with the Sanyo's CPU.andP;  This is an 80286switchable between 8/6MHz.andP;  I misread this as 8/16MHz the first time around.andO;Who has software which will only run at 6MHz?andP;  8MHz as a maximum seems slowin contrast to the 12MHz of the Samsung.andM;The manuals were not as comprehensive as those of the Samsung, and leapt in adepressingly familiar fashion from introductory information, such as what the'Enter' key does, to BIOS Interrupts, all within one manual.andP;  This sort ofthing can turn nervous, first-time users to drink.andP;  Samsung has at leastsegregated such intimidating information into the technical reference manual.andM;Sanyo supplies the S5200 with two sizes of hard disk, 20MHz and 40Mb.andP;  the40Mb disk is definitely worth the extra 85 pound sterling.andP;  Parallel andserial ports were already there, as were two expansion slots.andM;SummaryandM;The sanyo has the edge in terms of styling but If you actually want to use aluggable on more than an occasional basis, then you should seriously considerthe Samsung.andP;  What it lacked in elegance it made up for with a more relaxedkeyboard and screen readability.andP;  I enjoyed posing with the Sanyo, but foundit harder to part with the Samsung.andM;USER VERDICTandM;* PRODUCT NAME Samsung S5200 * SUPPLIER Samsung Electronic UK, Unit One,Hookrise Business andamp;
