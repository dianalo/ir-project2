Gorbachev suffered his firstmajor policy defeat in the 4-month-old Soviet legislature Tuesdaywhen it rejected his call for an emergency ban on workers' newlywon right to strike.   But Gorbachev told lawmakers he was satsified with a compromisethat imposes a selective ban on strikes in critical industries. Hesaid it would ``help restore a normal life.''   Gorbachev said Monday he wanted a ban on all strikes for thenext 15 months to prevent anarchy from overwhelming the shakySoviet economy. A wave of strikes, largely over ethnic andpolitical conflicts, cost the country $6.5 billion in July andAugust alone.   Strikes were ruthlessly suppressed for decades until Gorbachevbegan his effort to turn the country from a dictatorship into oneruled by law. It was only last year that workers began to succeedin pressuring for change by walking off the job.   It was the first time the new Supreme Soviet legislature stoodup to the government and opted for its own policy, though it hadpreviously rejected several Cabinet nominees. The legislature'sdisplay of independence was particularly significant because itcame on a package of emergency measures.   The compromise resolution, adopted by a vote of 364-6, prohibitsstrikes in the transport, energy, raw materials and metallurgyindustries, but only until the legislature passes a detailed lawdefining the right to strike.   That could be as soon as Monday, at the next session of the fulllegislature. Nearly half the articles in the strike law wereapproved Tuesday.   The more controversial sections, which have yet to face floordebate, would ban strikes that threaten human life or health, aswell as any aimed at overthrow of the government or violation ofethnic equality. It also would ban strikes in the transportation,communications, energy and defense industries, and among civilservants.   The draft also requires arbitration before a strike and allowsthe Supreme Soviet or its ruling Presidium to halt or delay strikes.   It also says those found responsible for a strike can be firedand fined up to three months' pay to help cover economic damages.It does not define responsibility, leaving open the possibilitythat managers who fail to resolve labor disputes could be held asguilty as strike leaders.   All of these points still await debate.   The emergency resolution adopted also permits the country'sministries of interior, defense and transport to guaranteeoperation of the railroads in Armenia and Azerbaijan if necessaryto get rail traffic moving again to Armenia.   Strikers in Azerbaijan motivated by ethnic demands created avirtual economic blockade of Armenia by interfering with shipmentson the main rail and road lines to the neighboring republic.Armenia and Azerbaijan are locked in a conflict over the disputedterritory of Nagorno-Karabakh, which has also been hit by lengthystrikes. Trains ship about 80 percent of the goods Armenia receivesfrom elsewhere in the Soviet Union.   In July, thousands of coal miners walked off the job demandingmore consumer goods and control over mining operations. Theyreturned to work only after Moscow agreed to a package of economicand social improvements that officials say will cost about $3billion.   Legislators from four committees who worked through the night onGorbachev's proposal to ban strikes originally offered him acomplete rebuff. Their weakened draft resolution, presented to theSupreme Soviet Tuesday morning, did not even mention any ban onstrikes.   During the debate, a deputy suggested prohibiting strikes onlyin key industries.   Gorbachev responded by repeating his warning that the Sovieteconomy is threatened by waves of politically motivated jobactions. But he did not call again for an outright ban on allstrikes.   Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin told reporters the blanket banwas rejected by the legislative group as unconstitutional.   ``We don't have a basis for deciding what is an extraordinarysituation,'' he said.   Leonid Abalkin, a deputy premier in charge of economic reform,confirmed that a dramatically different draft resolution cameduring the overnight meeting of deputies and not from Gorbachev.Speaking to reporters during a break in debate, he made it clearthat Kremlin leaders believe strong action is needed, andcriticized the deputies for caving into public pressure.   ``Everyone wants to be sympathetic, wants the public to likethem, and nobody wants to take the responsibility,'' he said.   Gorbachev received support from a number of liberals. MarjuLauristin, a deputy and leader of the Estonian Popular Front, saidduring a break she favored limits on strikes over political issuesbecause they damage the economy and could be used as an excuse formilitary intervention.   Russian workers in Estonia went on strike during the summer toprotest voting laws they say favor the majority Estonians.</TEXT></DOC>
