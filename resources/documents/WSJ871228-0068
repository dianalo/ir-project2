The sources said the Ministry of International Trade and Industry told oil importers Friday they should aim to keep January purchases of Iranian crude oil at about 70% of their previous contract levels. The unofficial guidance isn't directly binding.    MITI officials couldn't be reached for comment on the decision. In the past, ministry officials have denied they would set any limit on Iranian imports by Japan, though they also have said they would try to keep Japanese companies from taking advantage of Iran's weakened marketing position in the wake of the U.S. boycott.    Japan's oil importers had waited for the MITI guidelines before beginning negotiations in earnest with Iran on January crude purchases. A national Iranian Oil Co. team arrived in Tokyo Tuesday to discuss renewals of some 300,000 barrels a day in long-term contracts. Industry sources say the MITI guidelines would allow for about 210,000 barrels a day to be bought in January.    The U.S. imposed the embargo in October. Deputy Foreign Minister Ryohei Murata told visiting U.S. Undersecretary of State Michael Armacost on Oct. 31 that Japan wouldn't join the boycott because it wanted to give U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar a chance to mediate a settlement in the Iran-Iraq war.    Japan's leading business newspaper, the Nihon Kezai Shimbun, quoted a MITI official as saying Japan's move to reduce oil imports &quot;means to partially act in concert with the U.S. decision to impose economic sanctions on Iran.&quot; The newspaper said the Japanese action was taken &quot;in consideration of Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's visit to the U.S.&quot; next month.    Mr. Takeshita's talks with President Reagan and other U.S. officials are expected to be dominated by trade issues.    ---   Bank Lending Restrained   Special to The Wall Street Journal    TOKYO -- The Bank of Japan has told major commercial banks to restrain first-quarter lending growth to 3% from a year earlier, sources said.    As previously reported, the central bank, concerned about inflation, had held hearings with the banks to determine how much they should lend. It is acting because of concern that recent fast growth in the money supply may cause inflation to accelerate even though the yen's strength has helped restrain prices by making imports less expensive.    Total lending by the country's 13 major commercial banks is expected to total slightly more than three trillion yen ($23.98 billion) in the quarter.    The sources said the central bank also will allow Japan's three long-term credit banks to increase lending 3.4%, to 910 billion yen, and the seven trust banks to lift lending 3%, to 830 billion yen.    ---   Jobless Rate Is Unchanged   Special to The Wall Street Journal    TOKYO -- Japanese unemployment was unchanged in November from October at a seasonally adjusted 2.7% of the labor force, the government said Friday.    The number of people holding jobs rose 1.5% from a year earlier, to 59,650,000. Government officials traced the increase to a 0.6% gain in employment by manufacturers. That ended a steady decline and illustrated the impact that domestic demand is having on Japan's economy.    The economy had slumped as the strong yen raised the cost of Japanese exports. But it is rebounding because of a surge in domestic demand.    Meanwhile, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said production at Japan's factories and mines rose 10.7% in November from a year earlier, the fastest annual growth since industrial output began a steady climb in June. After seasonal adjustment, November output was unchanged from October.    MITI also said that sales at major retail stores rose 5.9% in November from the year before. </TEXT></DOC>
