Scott (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MD WNEWS </CO><IN> ARO </IN><DATELINE> ST. LOUIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   McDonnell Douglas Corp. said it is reassigning several senior executives following a recent reorganization of top management.    Earlier this week, the company named Gerald A. Johnston president, succeeding John F. McDonnell, who was named chairman and chief executive officer. Mr. McDonnell, son of the company's founder, succeeded his cousin, Sanford N. McDonnell, who retired.    The change in management structure is designed to &quot;maximize&quot; effectiveness and to strengthen the company's efficiency, McDonnell Douglas said. It also shows that Mr. McDonnell, who was promoted just last month, has moved to quickly put his stamp on the company. The new structure effectively eliminates one layer of senior management and requires more managers to report directly to Mr. McDonnell and the company's No. 2 executive, Mr. Johnston. &quot;I think we'll begin to see a greater focus on profitability and performance,&quot; one securities analyst said.    The aerospace and defense concern said it named Robert C. Little, formerly vice president, aerospace group executive, to the new post of vice chairman, government business.    The company said James E. Worsham, its other vice president, aerospace group executive, will return to his previous post of president of the Douglas Aircraft Co. unit in Long Beach, Calif. The subsidiary's current president, William T. Gross, will become a senior vice president at the unit.    The company said Jeremy J. Causley, formerly vice president, information systems group, was named president of the group, which has been renamed McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Co.    Louis F. Harrington, formerly a senior vice president of Douglas Aircraft, was named vice president, general manager of McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co., succeeding Mr. Johnston, the parent company's new president.    Also, James T. McMillan, president of the McDonnell Douglas Finance Corp. unit, was named to the additional post of chairman of the unit, and to the new position of corporate senior vice president, group executive. In addition, Mr. McMillan was named chairman of the McDonnell Douglas Realty Co. unit, succeeding John McDonnell. Mr. McMillan also will continue as chairman of the McDonnell Douglas Travel Co. unit.    McDonnell Douglas also named three vice presidents to new positions of senior vice presidents. The company said it named James H. MacDonald as senior vice president, employee and external relations; Jerry G. Brown as senior vice president, finance; and John R. Sant as senior vice president, general counsel. </TEXT></DOC>
