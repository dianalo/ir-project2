I wish I could,''he said.   Bush said he would continue using quiet diplomacy rather thanmilitary force to resolve the crisis.   ``I have tried to keep from escalating matters by making a lotof loud threats,'' he said. ``I have had to take certain prudentactions ... We are trying to handle this where diplomacy can bemost effective.''   But the president played down the possibility of imminentfreedom for the eight American hostages held in the Middle East.The Bush administration Tuesday rejected the idea of swapping thecaptives in Lebanon for $2 billion in Iranian assets frozen nearlyago decade ago.   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher dismissed thepossibility of such an exchange. ``The questions of the assets haveno connection or linkage whatsoever with the hostage issue,'' hesaid.   The president said he was ``satisfied'' that the U.S.intelligence network in Lebanon had improved in recent years ``butwe still don't have the intelligence that I would like to have. Ifwe had better intelligence, we might be able to surgically extractthe Americans that are still held hostage.''   White House officials said later that U.S. representatives woulddebrief United Nations envoy Marrack Goulding Wednesday in New Yorkabout his weeklong tour of the Middle East.   Goulding told reporters in Beirut on Monday after a series ofmeetings with Israeli, Moslem and Shiite leaders that``circumstances may be more conducive'' to a resolution than inrecent months.</TEXT></DOC>
