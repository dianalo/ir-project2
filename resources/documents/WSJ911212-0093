Such a sale would be logical because Convair, based in SanDiego, is under contract to build fuselages for McDonnellDouglas Corp.'s MD-11 jetliner. Taiwan Aerospace has signed atentative agreement to buy up to 40% of McDonnell Douglas'scommercial jet business and is slated to play a major role inmanufacturing the planned MD-12 airliner, which is an MD-11derivative.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;If the Taiwanese are going to build fuselage sections forthe MD-12, how do they learn to do it?&quot; asked a personfamiliar with the situation. &quot;It would sure help to get overthe learning curve if they could work on the MD-11.&quot;   United Auto Workers local 148, which represents McDonnellDouglas employees in Southern California and is opposed tothe company's deal with Taiwan Aerospace, issued an in-plantbulletin yesterday saying it recently &quot;became aware thatGeneral Dynamics has entered into exploratory discussionswith Taiwan Aerospace&quot; about the possible purchase of theConvair unit.   St. Louis-based General Dynamics declined to comment. Itcouldn't be determined if there have been any substantivetalks yet between General Dynamics and Taiwan Aerospace, aventure backed by the cash-rich Taipei government andprivate-sector interests. Industry analysts speculate thatthe asking price could range between $200 million and $600million, depending on the assets sold.   General Dynamics has said it wants to focus on its coredefense business and thus has been the subject of many rumorsabout possible divestitures. Representatives of TaiwanAerospace couldn't immediately be reached.   An industry official indicated that General Dynamics isstill at the stage where it's talking to a number of parties,including McDonnell Douglas itself. In fact, the officialsuggested, it might make sense for McDonnell Douglas to buyout its supplier's contract so that it could then use theConvair plant as a training center for workers who eventuallywill build the MD-12 fuselage. Presumably, they will do thatat a factory in Asia.   Besides the MD-11 fuselage, Convair also makes theTomahawk missile and the Advanced Cruise Missile. McDonnellDouglas also makes both of these missiles, but whether theConvair programs are the subject of any sales discussionswasn't immediately clear. Selling the military lines to aforeign entity isn't a possibility.   A spokesman for McDonnell Douglas, also based in St.Louis, declined comment.   A sale to any companies other than Taiwan Aerospace andMcDonnell Douglas might be more complicated because ofGeneral Dynamics's contractual obligations to McDonnellDouglas. Essentially, McDonnell Douglas would have to letGeneral Dynamics out of its contract and then sign up with anew subcontractor. Many aerospace companies have been seekingmore commercial work as the Pentagon budget dwindles.   However, the MD-11 fuselage business is a relativelylimited market. General Dynamics's contract calls for it tobuild 200 MD-11 fuselages, 61 of which already have beendelivered. That means there is only about four years ofproduction left.   There is the possibility for additional work, but some inthe industry question how interested McDonnell Douglas wouldbe in signing up with General Dynamics again because ofearlier complaints by McDonnell Douglas that the parts it wasreceiving had quality problems. The fuselages sell for about$9 million each, industry officials said. As of the end ofNovember, there were firm orders for 149 MD-11s on the books,as well as 178 options and reserves.   For General Dynamics, selling Convair would fit neatlywith Chairman William Anders's strategy to sell parts of thecompany that don't fit with its main defense operations. Mr.Anders recently called for the aerospace industry toeliminate inefficiencies by getting rid of unproductiveassets. He also has made clear that General Dynamics, whichhas been amassing cash, is prepared to unload its commerciallines. In October, General Dynamics formally put its Cessnasmall-airplane business on the block.</TEXT></DOC>
