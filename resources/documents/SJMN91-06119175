Chance Jr., 35, in suburban Orangevale. Thomasremained in custody in county jail on $100,000 bail.;    Unusual leniency; The slaying has prompted controversy in Sacramento, with complaints thatThomas was treated with unusual leniency by the county sheriff's department,headed by former CHP Commissioner Glen Craig. Thomas was not arrested until 24hours after the shooting because it was not immediately clear whether thekilling was justified, according to investigators.;    According to thetranscript, the 911 operator told Thomas, &quot;'No! No! No! Put the gun away andstay inside. . . . It's not worth a human life.&quot; According to Ure, who recitedportions of the transcript, Thomas replied, &quot;I'll try.&quot;;    Thomas toldauthorities on the telephone that Chance was &quot;cutting my fence,&quot; adding, &quot;Iwant to call the police before I go bananas.&quot; He later said that Chance was&quot;going nuts. He may come after me with a chain saw.&quot;;    Chance was not armedat the time of the shooting. Thomas reportedly had been on a stress-relateddisability leave at the time of the shooting.;    Long-running feud;  Earlierin the day, Chance had used a chain saw to cut down a segment of Thomas' newlyconstructed fence, capping a longrunning feud that had developed between thetwo men in connection with the fence that divided their property. Chance hadcomplained to county authorities -- and to Thomas himself -- that the fenceexceeded the county's height restrictions.;    County prosecutor DavidDruliner, seeking a higher bail, said &quot;there was an ongoing problem&quot; betweenThomas and Chance &quot;and the maximum limit had been reached for the defendant,who chose to solve it in a very violent fashion.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Sacramento  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910428  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  389  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday April 28, 199100119175,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
