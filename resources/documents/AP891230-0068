JohnRowland, R-Conn., looking ahead to the certain strife when thePentagon chief delivers his fiscal 1991 defense budget to Congressin late January.   Cheney touched off a tidal wave of dire predictions in thePentagon and concern in Congress when he directed the militaryservices to consider possible cuts amounting to $140 billion to$180 billion for fiscal 1992 to 1994.   On closer examination, the potential cuts in a 1992-94 DefenseDepartment wish list reflected a Pentagon realization that itsfuture spending levels would not differ significantly from theamounts Congress approved during the past five years, defenseanalysts and lawmakers say.   White House budget planners have told Cheney he can spend alittle more than $292 billion in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.That means the budget would not keep pace with inflation, which theadministration estimates is averaging 4.1 percent. Congressapproved $286 billion in fiscal 1990.   When Congress weighs the new budget, it will have to considerwhether to reduce military spending even further.   Lawmakers balked this year when Cheney proposed a military planfor fiscal 1990 that eliminated 10 conventional weapons programs,including the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey and the Navy's F-14D jetfighter, but left strategic programs such as the B-2 stealth bomberrelatively intact.   The fiscal 1990 defense budget that emerged from Congressrestored some of the money for the conventional weapons, cut fundssignificantly for the Strategic Defense Initiative and trimmed thebudget for other high-tech programs.   The nearly two-month process left some lawmakers shaking theirheads in disgust.   ``In my roughly 20 years involved in this, I've never seen suchforceful, if not ruthless, lobbying,'' Sen. John Warner ofVirginia, ranking Republican on the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, said of the wrangling over the F-14D jet fighter.   But those skirmishes will seem like child's play when Congresstackles the next budget, most observers say.   The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee took a swipeat the Bush administration on Thursday, charging that it bungledthe announcement of future defense cuts by failing to spell out amilitary strategy.   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said that without a strategy, theadministration faces the likelihood of lawmakers concerned withparochial interests crafting the defense budget.   ``I think it will be the most contentious in years ...especially with the shrinking budget and in light of what's goingon in Eastern Europe,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., an ArmedServices Committee member.   ``It will definitely be bloodier,'' said John Isaacs of theliberal group, Council for a Livable World.   Although all the budget numbers and possible weapons cuts havenot been hammered out _ and won't be officially until the budgetarrives on Capitol Hill _ likely reductions in the fiscal 1991budget have emerged in recent weeks.   To date, they include:   _Slightly more than $292 billion in Pentagon spending, whichwould mean the military budget won't keep pace with inflation,according to Defense Department sources, who requested anonymity.   _Stretching out production of the B-2 stealth bomber program,which could raise the per plane cost of the radar-evading aircraftfrom $530 million to as high as $1 billion.   _Cancellation of the Army's M-1 tank, according to congressionalsources, who asked not to be identified.   _Reduction of the current troop strength of 2.1 million by about275,000 and elimination of three Army combat divisions, five and afraction Air Force fighter wings and about 60 naval vessels from afleet of 562.   The defense budget for fiscal 1990 requires Cheney to considersubstantial troop cuts by reducing the military personnel accountby $461 million. Cheney must report to Congress by Jan. 1 toexplain how he will meet the cut.   Also on the chopping block again is the V-22 Osprey, whichCongress delayed a decision on by approving $255 million inresearch and development money for the tilt-rotor aircraft infiscal 1990.   The Pentagon recently ordered the Navy to cancel productioncontracts for the Osprey, although Congress had freed up more than$300 million in production money for the aircraft that had beenappropriated in fiscal 1989.   And The Associated Press reported Friday that the Navy isseriously considering limiting purchases of its $1.2 billionTrident submarine to every other year.   The battle lines being drawn between Congress and theadministration are obvious, according to lawmakers and defenseanalysts interviewed in the last two weeks. In the past, theadministration has trimmed the defense budget by eliminating orstretching out conventional programs popular in many districtswhile continuing funds for research and development of strategicprograms.   During the peacetime buildup of the Reagan administration, whenfew programs suffered, there were few complaints.   ``In the last six to eight years, there was a lot to goaround,'' said Rowland, a member of the House Armed ServicesCommittee. ``Who got the dough was making the pie.''   But without a clear threat from Eastern Europe and pressure toreduce the defense budget, parochial interests in Congress willclash with administration attempts to maintain a significant budgetfor strategic programs.   ``Our military priorities are wacky,'' said Sen. Carl Levin,D-Mich., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``Wherewe're eliminating or prematurely terminating or stretching theproduction of useful, modern conventional weapons systems in orderto produce an MX missile, the fight will go on. The battle will goon. This will not be easy.''</TEXT></DOC>
