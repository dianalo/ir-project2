Tighter guidelines for the use of deadly force began developingafter a federal study found that police shootings helped spark 13riots in the 1960s, said James Fyfe, a former New York policemanwho is chairman of American University's Department of Justice, Lawand Society.   ``New York was really at the forefront in terms of the degree ofthe restrictiveness of the policy, and remains the most restrainedamong the large police departments in terms of shooting,'' Fyfesaid.   None of which consoles Guy Ferraro, whose 31-year-old wife,Lidia, was killed early Wednesday in a hail of police bullets aftera car chase that began when she ran a red light.   ``She was defenseless. They surrounded her. It was coldbloodedmurder,'' said Ferraro.   Police said afterward that a sergeant had fired three shots atthe car's tires. Because of a police radio report that shots werefired, officers who converged on the scene may have thought thewoman fired the shots and was armed, police said. No weapon wasfound in her car.   The same day, a veteran officer was shot during a drug raid. Thefatal bullet came from another officer's gun _ not the gun of awoman arrested in the raid, as police originally reported.   Asked if firearms policy would be changed in the aftermath ofthe two shootings, Chief of Detectives Robert Colangelo responded,``We are constantly reviewing our policy.''   The sergeant who shot out Mrs. Ferraro's tires apparentlyviolated a 1985 department regulation against firing shots at amoving vehicle. The sergeant was suspended.   Virtually all major police departments have similar rules,experts said. A 1986 U.S. Supreme Court ruling said deadly physicalforce may not be used to stop a fleeing felon.   Fyfe, who researched police shootings in New York for hisdoctoral thesis, found that a restrictive policy instituted in 1972led to a sharp drop in the number of fatal police shootings, whichreached 87 in 1971.   From 1981 through 1984, the average was 33; in the past threeyears, it was 15, according to police figures.   The International Association of Chiefs of Police studied policeshootings in the 57 largest cities from 1975 through 1983. Fyfesaid that in terms of the number of fatal shootings per 1,000officers, New York had a relatively low rate of 1.36.   The highest rates were Jacksonville, Fla., at 7.17, followed byNew Orleans at 6.8 and Long Beach, Calif., at 6.1. At the lower endof the scale were Boston, 1.19; San Francisco, 1.4; Minneapolis,1.62; and Chicago, 1.71.   In other major cities, the rate in Dallas was 4.32; Houston,4.73; Los Angeles, 3.05; Detroit, 3.33; and Atlanta, 3.28.   Robert Trojanowicz, director of the School of Criminal Justiceat Michigan State University, said that in the past 15 to 20 years,fatal shootings by police have declined ``because they're gettingextensive training, and policies are becoming increasingly refined,specific and restrictive.''   ``In the past,'' he said, ``a person was given a weapon, put onthe street and expected to literally learn on the job.''   Internal investigations and pressure from citizens make it``very difficult with current procedures to cover up an errantpolice officer's actions,'' Trojanowicz said.</TEXT></DOC>
