James Blanchard is beginning to wonder if he can afford social activism on the cheap.    Washington activism, that is -- paid for with Michigan money.    &quot;Washington has gone from revenue sharing to revenue bleeding,&quot; complains the liberal Democrat, a sentiment increasingly voiced by governors of both parties and many shades of ideology. Congress, confronting monumental budget deficits, first terminated its revenue-sharing program with the states. Now, in an end run around those deficits, Congress and the White House increasingly are ordering up expensive new programs for the states to execute.    President Bush's new war on drugs alone could cost states well over $9 billion for new prisons and more police, maintains Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman. Tuesday, he conducted a hearing on those and other state costs associated with the program.    The result of such moves by the federal government has been to crimp the style of a new breed of activist governor that emerged in the 1980s to attack problems with more imagination and efficiency than Washington typically musters. Mr. Blanchard, himself a former congressman, epitomizes the breed -- and he isn't happy.    &quot;If we let this trend continue, I'm telling you, we're not going to have any budgets left,&quot; he warned colleagues at a recent National Governors Association convention. &quot;This is either a back-door tax increase or pushing off on states things that Congress, if it had any guts, would do itself.&quot;    He isn't alone. In a provocative phrase, the magazine Governing reported that state officials are beginning to feel like &quot;field hands of federalism.&quot;    &quot;What Washington once permitted states to do, it now requires us to do,&quot; complains Ohio Democratic Gov. Richard Celeste. In reaction, the usually low-key governors, at their convention, overwhelmingly urged Congress to slap a two-year freeze on new Medicaid mandates. They argued that current mandates are crippling their ability &quot;to properly fund education and other important services.&quot; A freeze would stop a proposed Medicaid expansion in its tracks.    Explosively growing state expenditures for Medicaid are projected to quadruple from about $12.5 billion nationally in 1970 to $50 billion in 1994. In Michigan, Medicaid is projected to cost $1 billion in the coming fiscal year. That's already a sizable chunk of a state budget of about $16.5 billion, and the cost is projected to increase a minimum of $200 million over the next three years.    This growth rate far outstrips the 3%-to-4% expansion of the Michigan budget as a whole. Among the results, says Shelby Solomon, Gov. Blanchard's director of management and budget, is &quot;a tug-of-war between constituencies&quot; -- and a lawsuit. Even as Congress eyes new Medicaid mandates, Michigan is struggling to contain the costs of the program -- and, for its pains, has been haled into court by angry health-care providers.    &quot;I don't think advocacy groups have any idea they've been snookered by Washington,&quot; says Gov. Blanchard. The White House and Congress, he says, are encouraging them to believe there is such a thing as a free lunch.    Sen. Biden would agree with that, at least when it comes to the new anti-drug program. &quot;The real {White House} strategy is that they're going to ask the states to bear the overwhelming bulk of the load,&quot; he says. He predicts states will be forced to raise taxes, even as President Bush continues to pose as an anti-tax champion.    Some advocacy groups, in turn, are dismayed to find liberal governors opposing liberal legislation like the Medicaid expansion, which would extend health coverage to now-excluded poor pregnant women and children.    &quot;I think the last thing they should be opposing is an expansion of children's health {programs}, even if they have to pick up some of the costs,&quot; says Sara Rosenbaum, director of programs and policy for the Children's Defense Fund. She argues it's &quot;disingenuous&quot; for governors to say the proposed Medicaid requirements would take money from education when the mandates would help children directly.    Adds Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities: &quot;While I think the governors have a larger point, this is one of the worst possible places to make it.&quot; He notes that &quot;poor prenatal care can have serious long-term effects,&quot; eventually forcing states to spend heavily on remedial education and other services.    Liberal House member Henry Waxman (D., Calif.) also has expressed &quot;profound disappointment&quot; with the governors' stand, while pointedly questioning the &quot;political logic&quot; of Democratic governors opposing social legislation.    The Medicaid measure passed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where Rep. Waxman chairs a subcommittee on health and the environment, would require states to phase in coverage of pregnant women and infants in families with incomes of almost double the federal poverty level. Under current law, states must provide similar coverage by next July, but only to families below the poverty level. They have an option to be more generous than that, however, and 20 states already are. Current law will mandate coverage of children up to age one; the legislation approved by the committee would require coverage up to age six, in families falling below the poverty level. The federal government pays from 50% to 78% of health-care costs for the Medicaid program, with the poorest states getting the most help in federal matching funds.    Medicaid is the states' biggest fiscal headache, but not their only one. In recent years, Congress has also passed a catastrophic-illness insurance program under Medicare that imposes state administrative costs; nursing-home reform that forces states to move some long-term mental health patients out of Medicaid-supported homes and into mostly state-supported community mental health centers; and environmental-cleanup programs, including one that will require states to locate and remove leaking underground fuel tanks. This year, Congress is considering a measure directing states to improve day-care facilities, plus the anti-drug war and the Medicaid expansion.    What is striking is that the complaints about federal mandates are coming from the nation's most imaginative governors. Most of them agree with the policy goals Washington is setting and most, like Republican Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey, believe states can achieve those goals better than Washington.    But there are two missing ingredients, from the state perspective. One is flexibility. &quot;The states want to work with Washington to set the performance goals,&quot; says Iowa Republican Gov. Terry Branstad, the new chairman of the National Governors Association. That's why, earlier this year, governors led a successful fight to strip some proposed state requirements from the child-care legislation in the Senate.    The other, more important, missing ingredient is federal money. Mr. Solomon, the Michigan gubernatorial aide, calculates that reduced aid from Washington, combined with increased Washington mandates, has caused &quot;a $3 billion swing&quot; in the state budget burden. Adds Ohio budget director Lee Walker: &quot;You really have to fund the mandated programs first.&quot; And once that has been done, there may be little left over for the governor's own priorities.    That's what happened this year to Gov. Bill Clinton. The Arkansas Democrat proposed a sweeping education package, accompanied by an increased sales tax, that would have given teachers an average $4,000 raise over two years. But the legislature, brushing aside the governor's argument that newly mandated federal programs were eating up much of his revenue, rejected the sales tax.    Even after larger-than-expected revenue receipts, the governor was able to deliver raises only in the $500-to-$700 range. &quot;We're going to fall behind other states after years of trying to get ahead,&quot; he warned during the fight. He's weighing another try at a special session.    In Michigan, Gov. Blanchard is pushing a half-cent increase in the sales tax to pay for educational improvements. He also has resorted to legislative brinksmanship to get programs started.    He threatened, for example, to veto the entire state education budget unless a new preschool program was funded. It was. But more commonly he has launched new programs by cutting old ones. Budgeting, says his budget chief, Mr. Solomon, &quot;has become a zero-sum game.&quot;    Thus Gov. Blanchard redirected welfare money to launch a new &quot;Job Start&quot; program that fights the high-school dropout problem and helps find jobs for graduates. Elements of his commerce department, the heart of his state economic-growth strategy, nevertheless took budget cuts of 10% or more. The money saved went into the general fund.    Gov. Blanchard and his colleagues will no doubt lobby President Bush for more money at an &quot;education summit&quot; Mr. Bush has called for late September. &quot;If George Bush can't face these {revenue} problems now, with 3 1/2 years to go before his next election campaign, he never will,&quot; the governor concludes.    But Gov. Blanchard isn't overly optimistic. And, as a former congressman himself, he isn't hopeful at all that Congress will stop mandating expensive new state programs.    &quot;They know they're not going to be held accountable,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
