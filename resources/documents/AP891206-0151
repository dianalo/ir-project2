The report, if confirmed, would appear to represent the biggestguerrilla victory over the Vietnamese-installed government sincecommunist Khmer Rouge rebels seized the rich gem-mining town ofPailin further south on Oct. 22.   The guerrillas said they captured Svay Chek on Tuesday night andTreas on Wednesday morning. The towns in northwestern Battambangprovince lie along Route 69, leading to the military operationscenter at Sisophon, 16 miles south of Svay Chek.   No immediate comment came from the government on the combatreport.   Ek Sereywath, spokesman for Prince Norodom Sihanouk's guerrillaforces, issued a statement saying 747 fighters of Sihanouk's groupand 300 from the Khmer People's National Liberation Front attackedTreas and captured two Soviet-built T-54 tanks and one 122mmartillery piece.   He said resistance forces seized seven tons of ammunition.   The resistance coalition consists of Sihanouk's forces, theKhmer Rouge and the Liberation Front.   About 3,000 Liberation Front guerrillas attacked Svay Chek, saidGen. Dien Del, deputy commander of the Front's army. He said manygovernment soldiers died and that ``six to seven'' guerrillas werekilled and 30 wounded.   ``We captured more than 1,000 weapons. We have been trying formore than a month to take Svay Chek. This is a big victory forus,'' said Dien Del, reached by telephone at the Thai border townof Aranyaprathet.   On Nov. 27, government forces repulsed the guerrillas frompositions around Svay Chek seized by the government the day before.The official state radio said 50 guerrillas died in that attack.   The guerrillas are fighting forces of the government thatVietnam installed after invading Cambodia in late 1978 and oustinga brutal Khmer Rouge regime.   The guerrillas have made important advances in battlefieldsbordering Thailand since late September, when Vietnam said itwithdrew the last of its troops. The guerrillas say they want toforce the government back to peace talks with more flexibility onthe issue of sharing power with the guerrillas.   Ek said the guerrillas destroyed bridges to cut a section ofnational highway running from the national capital, Phnom Penh, toSiem Reap, the northwestern provincial capital 140 miles away.   The highway is used to transport troops and supplies tonorthwestern battlefields. The claim could not be independentlyconfirmed.</TEXT></DOC>
