In a letter last Thursday to congressional housing-subcommittee leaders, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Samuel Pierce said he was revoking the increase as a &quot;gesture of good faith.&quot; The increase had taken effect March 1.    Both houses of Congress have been moving quickly to stop the fee boost. The House on Feb. 25 passed a measure to block it, and the Senate was expected to approve a similar bill this week. Reagan administration officials said they feared that the legislation, which would bar almost all fee increases by Ginnie Mae except those designed to cover increased costs, could threaten the agency's administrative flexibility.    For instance, Louis Gasper, Ginnie-Mae's executive vice president, noted that the agency could have its hands tied in changing some charges -- such as penalties to lenders who default -- that aren't related to cost.    In his letter to Congress, Mr. Pierce said the proposed legislation would put &quot;a virtual straitjacket on Ginnie Mae's fundamental business-management ability to adapt to changing needs and market requirements.&quot;    Several Reagan administration officials said support for the measures in Congress was too broad to defeat the bills or to prevent a presidential veto from being overridden. They said that by rescinding the fee boost, they hope to persuade lawmakers to give them more flexibility in setting fees.    But housing-subcommittee leaders in both chambers said they would go ahead with the legislation, anyway. &quot;I welcome this action, especially since the administration proposal never should have been put forth in the first place,&quot; said Sen. Alan Cranston (D., Calif.), head of the Senate's housing subcommittee. Nevertheless, said Sen. Cranston, &quot;I'm going to proceed with my bill to show the intent of Congress.&quot;    Ginnie Mae, a corporation wholly owned by the federal government, guarantees securities backed by Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Administration mortgages.    In January, the administration proposed to raise the fee for guaranteeing such securities to 10 basis points from six, arguing that the funds are needed to reduce the federal budget deficit, to replenish Ginnie Mae's reserves and to put Ginnie Mae fees on a more competitive basis with the private sector. A basis point equals 1/100th of a percentage point.    The fee increase would have brought Ginnie Mae an additional $52 million in annual revenue. In fiscal 1986, which ended Sept. 30, Ginnie Mae guaranteed $81.8 billion of securities.    The Reagan administration has tried several times in recent years to win congressional approval for raising the Ginnie Mae fee, but lawmakers rejected the idea each time. This year, HUD imposed the fee rise administratively, prompting an outcry from both Congress and the housing industry.    HUD officials said that although the increase had already taken effect, no refunds will be necessary because the fees are paid about six weeks after mortgage-backed securities are offered for sale. </TEXT></DOC>
