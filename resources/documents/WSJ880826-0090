The pressure will be applied next week when U.S. and Japanese trade negotiators face off in Hawaii. The talks come less than a week after President Reagan signed into law the Omnibus Trade Bill, which contains patent-law enforcement provisions that alarm the Japanese.    The Hawaii talks, which begin Monday, illustrate the shift in U.S.-Japan trade disputes from &quot;hard&quot; issues of trade in goods and services to &quot;soft&quot; issues of technology and intellectual property. Although the two nations have had exchanges over intellectual property before, this is the first time they are doing so through a full-scale working group. &quot;From now on, the focus will be on 'invisible' trade,&quot; says a Japanese Foreign Ministry official.    U.S. and Japanese government officials expect the meeting to be an amicable effort to identify issues, not a tough negotiating session. Still, there will be sparks.    Japanese officials complain the U.S. is strong-arming Japan to adopt U.S. patent and copyright procedures that aren't shared by the rest of the industrialized world. Japanese patent officials insist Japan has revamped its system to match world standards and that many U.S. demands are based on misunderstandings.    The U.S. isn't satisfied. &quot;We appreciate all these changes,&quot; says Michael Kirk, assistant commissioner of patents for international affairs, who will lead the U.S. team. &quot;But they're moving too slowly and there's more to be done.&quot;    The U.S. position is based on decades of frustration among U.S. companies over Japan's treatment of patents and copyrights. U.S. companies have been plagued by what they consider outright copying by Japanese companies.    The U.S. complains that the Japanese system allows companies to &quot;design around&quot; the U.S. patents. Fusion Systems Corp. is currently accusing Mitsubishi Electric Corp. of filing hundreds of patents to circumvent a Fusion patent for a high-intensity microwave lamp. In addition, U.S. companies have seen their prime patents stalled on Japanese bureaucrats' desks as Japanese competitors used the technology to gain new markets.    Corning Glass Works, for instance, applied for a patent on its optical fiber in the U.S. in 1974; the patent was granted two years later. It applied in 1975 for a Japanese patent; it was granted a Japanese patent in 1985. The U.S. has granted 85% of the patents Corning has requested. Japan has granted only 29%.    Japan readily concedes the U.S.'s biggest beef -- that Japan's patent system is excruciatingly slow. Patents take at least three years to clear, often five years or more, while patents in the U.S. clear in an average of two years.    That is because Japanese companies pride themselves in the masses of patents they produce; until revisions this year, Japan's patent system encouraged such &quot;patent flooding.&quot; Giants such as Toshiba Corp., NEC Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. file for more than 10,000 patents every year in Japan. The patent office is so overloaded, says patent officer Sohsuke Sato, &quot;we have a certain sense of crisis.&quot;    The longer a patent stays in the Japanese docket, U.S. patent experts complain, the more it is subject to challenge, because Japan automatically divulges patent applications after 18 months. Japan says it is doing all it can. It revised the patent law to make it easier to file &quot;multiple claim&quot; patents, which cover many aspects of a single technology, for example.    But Japan and the U.S. disagree on many other points that will emerge at Hawaii. Among the U.S. demands:   --Japan should adopt a longer grace period for an inventor to file for a patent after he discloses his invention in a scientific paper or lecture. The U.S. gives a year; Japan gives six months. Japan argues that Europe gives even less protection and that the issue should be settled multilaterally.    --Japan should be more flexible with foreign-language applications. Japan denies its system puts foreign applicants at a disadvantage.    --Japan should liberalize rules for amending applications to widen protection from frivolous challengers. Japan argues that its system already allows broader amendments than the U.S. system.    --Japan should adopt U.S.-style techniques for gathering facts in patent litigation. That would make U.S. companies less susceptible to gang-up tactics by Japanese competitors and offer quicker court relief. Japan says such a change would require total revamping of its judicial system.    The U.S. will also press Japan to increase copyright protection for sound recordings from the present 20 years to something closer to the 50 to 100 years the U.S. gives and to allow registration of service marks, such as an airline's name plate. It also wants Japan to tighten laws protecting trade secrets.    Japanese officials counter that a 20-to-30-year period of protection is the norm in Europe, that few other countries protect service marks and that fewer than half of the U.S. states have laws protecting trade secrets. &quot;It's the U.S. that's peculiar, not us,&quot; says the Foreign Ministry official.    The Japanese have their own complaints. Japan will pressure the U.S. to join the Bern Convention, which governs certain copyrights. It will urge the U.S. not to restrict digital audio tape machines, which can make high-quality recordings of records and compact disks. And Japan is likely to voice worry over a stipulation in the new U.S. trade law giving the U.S. International Trade Commission 90 days to reach a tentative decision on a complaint of a foreign violation of a U.S. patent. Japan says that isn't enough time. </TEXT></DOC>
