On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, settled32 cents higher at $17.70 a barrel after trading as low as $17.22during the session. On Monday, the contract lost 15 cents. Othercontract months also ended the day higher.   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the March contractfor domestic heating oil fell 0.49 cent to close the day at 49.87cents a gallon. Other contract months also lost ground.   Unleaded gasoline for March delivery closed up 0.52 cent at 49.26cents a gallon with other contract months ending the day mixed.   Market observers said the gains were partly to internal marketinfluences of supply and demand.   But a combination of mostly OPEC-related factors also influencedthe market, including speculation over the possibility of a newprice-stabilization agreement emerging from the the cartel'sprice-monitoring committee meeting scheduled for March, said NaumanBarakat of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   Investors also are anticipating a meeting of non-OPEC producersthat may include the Soviet Union could also result in higherprices, he said.   ``The fact that they want to meet again is keeping the marketexcited,'' Barakat said.   Several non-OPEC oil producers met last month with Sovietrepresentatives attending as observers. The meeting produced nosubstantial results, but the group said it hoped to find ways tohelp the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries stabilizeworld oil prices.</TEXT></DOC>
