The justices said they will decide whether a federal agencyshould have been allowed to transfer the groups' lawsuit against itfrom state to federal court, where the suit was killed.   If the animal rights groups win in the high court, their fightwill be sent back to a Maryland state court. If the justices hadrejected the groups' appeal, their legal fight would have ended.   The controversy dates back to 1981. Alex Pacheco, then a GeorgeWashington University student, said the research business for whichhe worked as a volunteer did not provide sufficient food and water,sanitation or veterinary care for 17 macaque monkeys.   Only four of the original group of 17 are the subjects of thelegal fight. Five have been moved to the San Diego Zoo and eighthave died or been killed.   In a federally funded project at its Silver Spring, Md.,laboratory, the Institute for Behavioral Research was studying theability of monkeys to use limbs after nerves were severed.   Maryland police seized the monkeys in late 1981, and theNational Institutes of Health, a federal agency, assumed custody ofthe animals. They eventually ended up at Tulane University's DeltaRegional Primate Research Center in Covington, La.   NIH was sued in 1988 by Pacheco and the group he founded, Peoplefor the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and two other animal rightsgroups - International Primate Protection League and Louisiana InSupport of Animals.   The groups filed their lawsuit in a state court, but the NIH hadthe case transferred to a federal court. Eventually, the 5th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the lawsuit dismissed.   The issue to be decided by the Supreme Court is whether thefederal agency should have been allowed to remove the lawsuit fromthe state court.</TEXT></DOC>
