(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Marines guarding the U.S. embassiesabroad are often limited in off-duty activities, but now there'ssomething for their minds _ college by mail.   The Marine Security Guard Battalion reached an agreement recentlywith Penn State University to offer an associate-degree program tothe 1,450 Marines guarding 141 embassies and consulates around theworld.   Taking classes by mail will help relieve boredom in such hardshipposts as the embassy in Ouagadougou, the capital of the west Africannation of Burkina Faso, Marine Capt. David Vindich said.   ``There's absolutely nothing there,'' said Vindich, thebattalion's education officer.   Also, Marines stationed at embassies and consulates in the SovietUnion are restricted by a non-fraternization policy, while those inBeirut can't leave the compound because of the country's civil war.   ``A lot of these places are really isolated,'' Vindich said.``We're providing an educational opportunity and we're also givingthem something to do.''   Vindich said Marines in the elite, all-volunteer battaliongenerally spend 15 months in a hardship post and then 15 months at aless rigorous embassy or consulate.   More than 400 Marines serving in embassies and consulates alreadytake courses, but their efforts toward degrees have been largelyunstructured, he said.   ``They were out there spinning their wheels. You talk collegecredits and semester hours and that kind of thing, it boggles themind of a 19-year-old kid just out of high school, 10,000 miles fromhome,'' Vindich said in a telephone interview from Quantico, Va.   Under an agreement reached in May, Penn State will offer liberalarts degrees in letters, arts and sciences. The university hasplanned course concentrations for the Marines including business,security and justice, political analysis and foreign policy, andlanguage and culture.   Vindich said he expects 400 would sign up this year.   An associate degree would cost about $4,800 or $5,000, said PeterForster, coordinator of special programs at Penn State's Departmentof Independent Learning. Vindich said the Marine Corps pays 75percent of tuition costs.   Penn State has the largest university-based correspondence courseprogram in the United States, offering 225 courses to 22,000students.</TEXT></DOC>
