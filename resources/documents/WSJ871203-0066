As Ssangyong's absolute ruler, he kept wage levels and workers where he wanted them. The government used cut-rate loans to finance his expansion and diversification into construction, textiles, auto making and electronics. Foreign markets opened as quickly as he could manufacture products, and his company's growth, along with South Korea's, seemed unlimited.    But Mr. Kim faces a challenge his father never had to confront: democracy. &quot;We are in for four or five years of difficult times,&quot; says Mr. Kim, the 42-year-old, U.S.-educated chairman of Ssangyong. &quot;There will be unanswerable demands from unions. There will be pressure to broaden ownership of conglomerates. This is a delicate time in South Korea. We may have to go through a disorderly period.&quot;    On Dec. 16, South Koreans are scheduled to vote for a new president. If the elections go as planned, they will mark the first democratic and peaceful transition of power in South Korea's history. But business leaders worry that democracy will diminish the economic miracle that has turned little South Korea into an exporting giant. No matter who is elected, they fear that South Korea's &quot;democratization&quot; will mean more uncertainty -- union problems, investor nervousness, reduced government support, slower growth and less price competitiveness.    &quot;We will still grow, probably faster than other industrialized economies, but we will definitely slow down,&quot; says Koo Bon Young of the government's powerful Economic Planning Board. &quot;The biggest change is we will sacrifice efficiency that we've had in the past. There will be more disunity between the various actors in the economic system, but our underlying strength will remain.&quot;    South Korea's economic success comes from a mix of government intervention and free-market energy. Now bureaucrats are wrestling with a difficult new world of special-interest and constituent demands. Labor negotiations next spring are likely to be combative, following the success of strikes at more than 3,000 companies in August. With the election in sight, the government for the first time sided with workers against management.    &quot;Economic planners always make choices between efficiency and equity, and in the past whenever there were conflicts they maximized efficiency at the cost of equity,&quot; Mr. Koo says. &quot;From now on, it will become more difficult for economic planners to base policies on efficiencies.&quot; Korean factory workers work a six-day week of between 48 and 54 hours; their hard work for low wages has helped make South Korea an aggressive exporter of textiles, steel, electronic goods and autos. But now the workers want more generous wages and benefits and better, safer working conditions.    &quot;We are witnessing the end of South Korea's equivalent to our Robber Baron era,&quot; says a Western diplomat.    Popular opinion has turned heavily against South Korea's conglomerates, the top 30 of which control 45% of the country's industrial assets. Their long unbridled growth has become an election issue. Laws are being written to encourage them to sell more shares to the public and their workers, and opposition candidates threaten inheritance taxes that will leave owners hard-pressed to maintain their enterprises as family dynasties.    Finance Minister Sakong Il believes the longer-term outlook remains good, but he sees a &quot;rough&quot; period, of six months to a year, ahead. &quot;Higher wages and overheads will cut corporate earnings, leading to a short-term drop in business investment,&quot; he says. The government is fighting inflation and urging companies to go into more capital-intensive industries and modernize factories in order to offset the danger of reduced price competitiveness. Profits are expected to fall to 3% of sales from 4.2%.    The Korean Development Institute predicts that economic growth will slow to 7% next year from 12.5% in 1987, and that inflation will rise to 6% from 3%. It predicts the surplus on the current account -- the broadest trade measure -- will narrow to $4.8 billion from $8.5 billion this year and contract even further in 1989, to $3 billion.    Because there would be pressure to curb imports, any slowdown in growth could aggravate already-heated trade tensions with the U.S., the market for 40% of Korean exports. David Mulford, an assistant Treasury secretary, recently criticized Korea and other rapidly industrializing Asian countries for &quot;their current excessive dependence on exports.&quot; He criticized Korea for keeping its currency, the won, too low in relation to the dollar to encourage exports and attacked Seoul for maintaining what he called unfair trade and investment barriers.    Trade Ministry officials expect an $8.5 billion 1987 trade surplus with the U.S. Hence, Seoul will likely have to allow in more U.S. products to deflect retaliation by Washington. But government officials say that will trigger unprecedented internal political struggles and charges that South Korea is a victim of arm-twisting by a superpower.    The presidential candidates aren't promising radical economic reforms; nobody wants to risk derailing an economy that has increased annual per-capita income 25-fold, to about $2,400, in 20 years. Government officials charge that the opposition would be more likely to bend to post-election demands from farmers and blue-collar workers for higher wages and government-financed benefits. But even the current conservative government of President Chun Doo Hwan has increased spending on such new social programs as national health insurance and pensions.    Strategists for Roh Tae Woo, the government's candidate, say he wants to promote the growth of small and medium-size businesses and diversify export markets.    Even the opposition candidate often labeled by the government as a closet communist defends free markets with establishment passion. &quot;I emphatically reject socialism,&quot; says Kim Dae Jung. &quot;It isn't conducive to individual creativity and responsibility. I believe in the function of the market mechanism for allocation of resources as much as Adam Smith.&quot; But despite such assurances, business leaders fear his election will cause political turmoil and undermine business confidence.    Opposition candidate Kim Young Sam's economic adviser, Hong Sa Duk, says his boss believes in &quot;gradualism in all things. There will be no big difference economically after the opposition party of Kim Young Sam takes power. For that matter, there also won't be much difference under Kim Dae Jung.&quot;    All parties agree that action is most urgently needed in the financial sector, where government controls, lack of liquidity and a slew of nonperforming loans impede development. The government ratifies the choice of the top executives of the country's five commercial banks, approves new loans to the country's 50 largest debtors and mandates that 30% of all lending must go to small and medium-size businesses.    Businessmen complain that government meddling in the banks hasn't allowed the South Korean commercial sector to mature. &quot;The banking sector should be freed,&quot; says Mr. Kim of Ssangyong. &quot;The Korean economy has grown so rapidly that we have outraced our developing country management system.&quot;    But most don't expect rapid change. &quot;There will be a lot of talk about change, but whoever becomes president will like to have some control over the financial sector,&quot; says Suh San Mok, director of the Korean Development Institute.    Indeed, bankers and businessmen have come to rely on government intrusion. When the owner of the Dong-A jeep and truck company wanted to sell his financially troubled enterprise this year, he asked the Trade Ministry to find him a buyer. A deputy minister telephoned Ssangyong's Mr. Kim, who bought Dong-A. &quot;That's the way deals are struck here,&quot; says Mr. Kim.    So far, the clearest economic winners are the workers, who feel they haven't shared equally in Korea's economic growth. Koreans have a strong egalitarian bent, and workers are making demands ranging from workplace safety to sharing dining facilities with managers.    &quot;The labor unions next year will be much more militant than they were this year,&quot; predicts Park Young Chul, President Chun's chief economic adviser. Because there are four main candidates, he says, the next president is likely to win less than 40% of the vote and won't have the mandate to resist worker demands. </TEXT></DOC>
