The momentum to deregulate has continued with the industry'ssupport and most recently was manifested by the signing of The Canada-USFree Trade Agreement. Canada has historically been the major supplierof imported propane to the US market. This paper presents one producerand marketer's appraisal of the role Canada is likely to play in meetingUS propane shortfalls through the 1990s. Canadian natural gas productionwill expand considerably during the 1990s to meet a modest expandionof domestic demand and in response to the growing opportunities of theUS export market. Current forecasts suggest that gas exports to the USwill increase from just under the 1 Tcf level achieved in 1987 to the1.8 Tcf range by 1995/2000, thus pushing total sales of Canadian gasto 4.3 Tcf by 2000. The other factor to be considered when forecastingpropane production from natural gas streams is the liquids content ofthe gas. Canadian end-use markets for propane are similar to those inthe US: residential and commercial space heating, crop drying, specialtyindustrial applications, transportations and petrochemicals. In addition,over the next five years growing volumes are expected to be used in miscibleflood projects. The petrochemical sector accounts for the balance offinal consumption of propane in Canada. Based on the foregoing supply/demandanalysis the authors see Canadian propane surpluses growing from an estimated50 thousand b/d achieved in 1987 to nearly 65 thousand b/d in the early1990s.</TEXT></DOC>
