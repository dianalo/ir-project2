North.   Six months after charges against Joseph F. Fernandez weredismissed on a legal technicality, a new indictment against theformer station chief in Costa Rica was returned Monday. Missing wasthe charge that he conspired to deliver arms to the Contras whensuch aid was banned by Congress.   The original conspiracy charge alleged that Fernandez workedwith former National Security Council aide Oliver L. North and armsdealer Richard V. Secord to set up the covert arms-supply network.   The new indictment focused on charges that Fernandez lied toobstruct inquiries of the CIA's inspector general and thepresidential commission headed by former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas,that investigated the Iran-Contra affair.   James Wieghart, a spokesman for prosecutor Lawrence Walsh,refused to comment on why the conspiracy charge was not containedin the new indictment.   But it appeared that Walsh decided not to pursue thatarms-resupply allegation because it was fraught with the samesecrecy concerns that forced him to drop similar charges againstNorth.   Earlier this year, Walsh dropped charges that North conspiredwith others to divert $15 million in U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits tothe Nicaraguan rebels when the government refused to release secretdocuments the trial judge ruled were needed for North's defense.   A federal court jury in Washington is deliberating on 12 relatedcharges against North, including allegations he lied to Congressabout the Iran-Contra affair.   Legal observers have considered the Fernandez case even moreladen with secrecy problems because his lawyers are expected toseek court approval to disclose details of his CIA activities inCentral America, where he used the alias Tomas Castillo.   Walsh avoided those issues by obtaining a narrow indictmentcharging that Fernandez lied when he denied he helped set up theairstrip in northern Costa Rica for the resupply operation and saidhe did not know that North was involved in the effort.   Fernandez is also accused of lying to the CIA by stating thatthe airstrip was built by the Costa Rican government to trainpilots for a possible Nicaraguan invasion of Costa Rica.   Each of four charges in the indictment carries a maximumfive-year sentence and a $250,000 fine upon conviction.   The original five-count indictment, brought in Washington, wasdismissed Oct. 19 after a judge ruled the charges should have beenbrought in Virginia because Fernandez was questioned at CIAheadquarters in Langley, Va., just across the Potomac River.   U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. gave Walsh the optionof bringing the charges again in federal court in Alexandria.Fernandez is to appear there May 1 for arraignment before U.S.District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr.</TEXT></DOC>
