Thg Interior Ministry announced early today that Bendjedid, thesingle candidate, had captured 81 percent of Thursday's vote.   About 89 percent of the country's 12 million eligible voters castballots. Voter turnout in Algeria traditionally runs at about 90percent.   As in most one-party states where a single candidate is on theballot, voter abstention is seen as the only real form of dissent inelections.   Although still winning a high percentage of votes, the win was 14percent smaller than 1984 when Bendjedid garnered 95 percent of thevote with voter turnout at about 95 percent. In 1979, he took 94percent.   While reflecting a decline in popularity, the election stillgives Bendjedid a clear mandate to continue with the economicreforms introduced after a week of rioting in early October thatclaimed 176 lives.   Rioters filled the streets to protest high unemployment,inflation and a chronic housing shortage. In an effort to restorecalm, Bendjedid promised a more liberal political system and lesscentral control of both the economy and society.   In his third term, Bendjedid faces the task of reducing the powerof a military and civilian bureaucracy that has built a comfortableposition in the 25 years since independence from France.   He also has promised to loosen the grip of the NationalLiberation Front, the only legal political party, on all aspects ofAlgerian life. One problem is how to permit more autonomy anddemocratic freedom without allowing opposition parties.   The severe economic problems remain, many traceable to severalyears of low oil prices on world markets. Unemployment and annualinflation have surpassed 20 percent and the foreign debt is $23billion.</TEXT></DOC>
