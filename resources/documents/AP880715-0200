The two men talked by telephone and agreed to have their topaides meet in Atlanta Saturday night, as they edged away from aconfrontation that threatened to disturb the peace at the party'sconvention.   ``I want him involved, I want his staff people involved,'' saidDukakis, whose nomination is assured. At the same time, he curtlyrejected his rival's call to have former President Carter mediatetheir disagreements. ``We don't need mediators,'' he said in aninterview in the Massachusetts Statehouse.   Carter, in an interview in Atlanta, also said his services as amediator were unneeded. He called for better communication andsuggested relatively minor differences between Dukakis and Jacksoncould vanish ``if the two men understood each other a little bitbetter.''   The latest Democratic developments came as Vice President GeorgeBush was ready to hang a ``gone fishing'' sign on his door inWashington. Aides said he would spend the next several days inWyoming with Treasury Secretary James Baker, who is expected toresign his Cabinet post shortly to join his old friend's campaignfor the White House.   Bush's Republican surrogates set up camp behind enemy lines inAtlanta and began stressing the policy differences between Dukakisand his more conservative running mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen.   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said that regardless ofwhom Bush picks as his vice presidential candidate, ``you're goingto find only shades of difference in our philosphy, not this chasmyou find between Dukakis on the one hand and Lloyd Bentsen on theother.''   In his Statehouse interview, Dukakis insisted that Democrats areunified despite Jackson's prodding on platform issues and Jacksonsupporters' complaints about the selection of Texas Sen. LloydBentsen as running mate.   ``I can't remember a time when we've (the Democrats) been moretogether,'' he said.   He said he thought the party reflected ``a broad nationalconsensus'' on such issues as trade, plant closing, health care andthe environment.   ``I think that's the reason you just don't have these deepideological divisions that you often have had in the past.''   Jackson's convention manager, Ron Brown, said the two sides hadalready smoothed out most of their differences on the Democraticplatform before Jackson called a halt to the formal negotiations.   If the talks resume, Brown said in an interview in Atlanta,``we'd be close to signing off on it.''   Jackson called a news conference in Louisville, Ky., as his buscaravan wound southward toward the convention city.   ``We simply cannot win without each other. We can only win witheach other,'' he said of himself and Dukakis.   ``It is in our distinct advantage to find common ground.''   ``Given the creative tension in the past few days, taking adiplomatic initiative to get more people involved is the rightthing to do,'' Jackson said of the meetings of top aides set forthe weekend.   He refused to say whether he would challenge Bentsen's vicepresidential nomination, and Dukakis said he didn't know what wouldhappen on that score.   For his part, Dukakis refused to disclose the nature of hisconversation with Jackson. But he ruled out his rival's idea tohave former President Carter play mediator in their pre-conventiondisagreements.   Carter also said he didn't think his services were needed.   ``I don't think they need any mediation. I think what is neededis to just have a better means of communication between oneanother,'' he added in an interview.   Even before they made their comments, the idea seemed to begoing nowhere.   ``I don't think, in my view, that the fact that there has beensome miscommunication at this point requires the president of theUnited States to come to the table,'' Party chairman Paul Kirk toldCBS in an interview.   A top Jackson aide also cast doubt on the idea, and Bert Lance,a confidant of both the former president and Jackson, did as well.``Mike and Jesse can deal with whatever they have to deal with,''he said.   The Democratic convention city was beginning to fill up withdelegates _ and three out of every four belonged to Dukakis.   The few remaining uncommitted officials seemed headed towardDukakis' camp. Virginia Gov. Gerald L. Baliles, for one, announcedhis support in Richmond.   Dukakis spent time in his Statehouse office in Boston, grapplingwith budget difficulties for the current fiscal year and the onejust ended. He is expected to travel to Atlanta on Sunday, and willbe nominated for president three nights later.   In conversations with reporters, Jackson said he would meet withDukakis ``at an appropriate time.'' He broke off negotiations onthe platform earlier in the week, after learning of Bentsen'sselection as the Democratic vice presidential candidate from areporter rather than from Dukakis.   He also said Carter could help mediate ``at the appropriatetime,'' but his top aide, Ron Brown, seemed to back away from theidea. Brown said that any role for Carter was ``not clear yet.''   Even before the Democrats formally convened, Republicans wereworking on their own convention, set to begin in New Orleans onAug. 15.   The city won preliminary approval from the state's BondCommission to borrow up to $30 million to help pay its share ofconvention costs.</TEXT></DOC>
