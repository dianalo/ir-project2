The Air Force telephoned the Ribas Dominicci family in PuertoRico on Friday night to inform them the body released by Libya hadbeen identified in Italy as that of Fernando Ribas Dominicci. The33-year-old airman was killed during the April 15, 1986 raids onLibya.   ``After getting over this shock, we have asked the Pentagon for acomplete autopsy to know the cause of his death,'' '' said the slainpilot's brother, Salvador.   He said he also wants a family doctor to certify whether it isRibas Dominicci's body.   Libyan authorities turned over the body Friday to the papalrepresentative in Tripoli. They said it belonged to Capt. PaulLorence, 31, of San Francisco.   Lorence and Ribas Dominicci, a native of Utuado, Puerto Rico,piloted the F-111 bomber that was the only plane lost in the raidson Libya. The other body was never found, the Libyans said.   ``They were only four inches apart in the cabin,'' said thebrother, a 38-year-old attorney who spoke by telephone from thewestern city of Mayaguez, 80 miles west of San Juan.   The pilot was the youngest of six brothers. Fernando RibasDominicci also left a wife, Blanca, and a son, also named Fernando,who is now 7 years old. They live in Austin, Texas.   The Italian news agency ANSA quoted an Italian forensic expertamong three Italians and three Americans who helped identify thebody as saying, ``The identification was made possible on the basisof the comparision of teeth'' with documents provided by U.S.authorities. ANSA said the body was well preserved.   Ribas Dominicci said the family has doubts because of a Libyantelevision report and pictures of the body when it was found, threemonths after the raid. The broadcast said the body had been washedashore and identified it as Lorence's.   ``No body is in good condition after floating in the water forthree months,'' said Ribas Dominicci.   He said the family also is skeptical of Gadhafi's motives, sayingit could be a publicity stunt.   ``With Ghadhafi, I don't discard any possibility,'' he said.   Ribas Dominicci said his 87-year-old father had not been told ofthe development because he is ill.   ``This is like reliving a sad episode,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
