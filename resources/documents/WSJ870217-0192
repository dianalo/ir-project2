The company, the dominant U.S. robot maker and an equally owned joint venture of GM and Japan's Fujitsu Fanuc Ltd., said it would lay off about 70 employees, cutting its work force to 480. Last year, the company trimmed 200 people from its payroll after GM canceled orders.    GMFanuc's problems reflect the trouble in the robotics industry in general, largely because of cuts in orders from the auto makers. GM, in addition to cutting back on capital investment, last year slowed its automation program following production problems at certain heavily automated facilities. </TEXT></DOC>
