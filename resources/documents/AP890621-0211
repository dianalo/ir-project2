(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than 42,000 coal miners in 10states took part in wildcat strikes Wednesday that spread inAppalachia and the Midwest. Reports of violence and blockadesmounted as coal companies sought relief from the courts.   ``It looks like the bulk of the industry is shut down,'' saidTaylor Pensoneau, vice president of the Illinois Coal Association.   More than 7,000 miners in Illinois and 700 in Ohio joined thewildcat strike Wednesday in sympathy with about 1,900 United MineWorkers members striking Pittston Coal Group Inc. in West Virginia,Virginia and Kentucky. More than 4,000 additional workers inPennsylvania also walked off the job.   U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp hit six UMW locals with fines of$2,500 each for defying a back-to-work order sought by Island CreekCorp., and a Virginia judge fined the union $300,000 for violatinghis rules on picketing.   In Alabama, three coal companies filed complaints against UMWmembers in a bid to get miners back to work.   West Virginia police said there have been sporadic reports ofminor violence in the state's southern coal fields in the past fewdays.   Several hundred UMW members refusing to work converged on thesouthern Virginia coal fields and used convoy tactics to block theentrances to Pittston processing plants. More than 200 cars andpickups drove up and down the roads in front of the plant entrances.   In addition, about 800 camouflage-clad coal miners from ahalf-dozen states converged on the state Capitol in Richmond, Va.,to pledge support for the Pittston strikers.   There still was no indication when the unauthorized walkoutsmight end, even though three jailed strike organizers were releasedin Virginia on Tuesday and a two-week vacation period is scheduledto start for thousands of miners at midnight Friday.   ``It's just a day-by-day thing,'' said Danny Wells, an incomingexecutive board member of Charleston, W.Va.-based District 17. ``Asfar as what might happen down the road there's just nobody that canpredict that.''   Wells said miners are upset with huge fines levied against theunion in Virginia and the lack of negotiations between Pittston andthe UMW.   In Illinois, a strike that had been limited to a Wabash Counymine owned by AMAX Coal Co. spread to at least 40 sites, affecting12 major coal companies, union officials said.   Central Ohio Coal Co. miners failed to show for work at the OhioPower Co. subsidary with operations in four counties, while another120 failed to show at Peabody Coal's Simco mine.   More than 100 miners showed up at U.S. District Court inCharleston, where Knapp fined the six locals. In addition, hethreatened to fine the locals $500 apiece for each day they fail tocomply with the back-to-work order. He also fined the locals'officers $200 and each union member $50, with the penalties toincrease by $50 a day for each day they remain in violation.   Howard Green, a UMW international executive board member, saidthe 190 Island Creek miners showed up for work Tuesday butencountered pickets and refused to cross the line.   In Indiana, Old Ben Coal Co. asked a federal judge to find minersstriking two locations in contempt for disobeying a back-to-workorder. The strike has affected about 240 Old Ben Coal workers.   In Tazewell County, Va., Circuit Judge N.E. Persin ruled theunion was responsible for picket line misconduct that resulted incoal trucks being the targets of objects thrown at several coaloperations.   About 100 miners converged on U.S. District Court in Clarksburg,W.Va., where Consolidation Coal Co. was seeking a back-to-work orderfor miners at six union locals in north central West Virginia.Consolidation officials have indicated they plan similar action forwildcat sites in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Illinois.   After a day of testimony, U.S. District Judge William Kiddrecessed the hearing until Thursday afternoon.   In Alabama, Jim Walter Resources filed a suit in federal court atBirmingham seeking unspecified damages from UMW and its District 20.U.S. Steel Mining Co. and Drummond Co. Inc. filed complaints withthe National Labor Relations Board.   The windshield of a truck was broken when the vehicle was struckby five .22-caliber rifle bullets in Walker County on Tuesday. Thedriver was not hit.   Gunshots were fired Wednesday afternoon at a guard shack at theLogan-Mingo Mine Co. office near Gilbert, but no one was wounded,said West Virginia state Trooper Ric Robinson.   West Virginia state police Superintendent J.R. Buckalew saidthere have been sporadic reports of minor violence in the state,mainly ``hoodlum-type people who do their business hidden in theleaves or in the darkness.''   According to union and industry officials, the estimated numberof miners involved Wednesday in unauthorized walkouts are: WestVirginia, 16,000; Illinois, 8,000; Alabama, 5,000; Ohio, 2,660;Pennsylvania, 6,600; Indiana 1,750; Kentucky, 1,500; Virginia, 755;Missouri, 350; and Tennessee, 200.</TEXT></DOC>
