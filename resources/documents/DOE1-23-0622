<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-23-0622 </DOCNO><TEXT>Electron Paramagnetic Resonance measurements have been made on silicon-on-silicondioxide and silicon-on-silicon nitride structures produced by ion implantation.In the former type of structure the EPR spectra have been ascribed tothe oxygen vacancy centre E{sub 1} in the SiO{sub 2}, the defect P/subbO/ at the Si/SiO{sub 2} interfaces and the amorphous silicon centrein the bulk silicon. A single line of width {Delta}B/sup pp/=0.84(2)mT and an isotropic g=2.0039(2) has been found in the latter structureand is attributed to silicon dangling bonds in the silicon nitride. Theannealing behavior of these defects both in air and nitrogen has beenmeasured.</TEXT></DOC>
