Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, a prominent plastic surgeon, was sent tothe District of Columbia Jail on civil contempt charges in August1987 after refusing to produce her daughter Hilary forcourt-ordered visits with Eric Foretich, Morgan's ex-husband andthe girl's father.   Morgan said she hid the girl because Foretich had sexuallyabused her; Foretich has denied those charges. Morgan has been inprison ever since, and the six-year-old Hilary's whereabouts areunknown.   ``She will not trade her freedom for her daughter's safety,''Stephen Sachs, Morgan's attorney, told a three-judge District ofColumbia Court of Appeals panel that was reviewing a lower courtjudge's decision to keep Morgan behind bars.   Civil contempt of court jailings are designed to coerce aninmate into providing information, property or persons the courtseeks, but Sachs argued that since Morgan has not cooperated andhas not been charged with a crime, her jailing violates her dueprocess rights.   ``Dr. Morgan is confined unconstitutionally because herincarceration will not serve a coercive function,'' Sachs said.``There is no substantive likelihood that she will relent (andreveal her daughter's location) _ not today, not tomorrow, notever.''   While in jail, Morgan has been forced to shut down heronce-thriving plastic surgery practice, and Sachs said her debtsnow exceed $1.5 million.   ``She has demonstrated her resolve,'' Sachs argued. ``This isnot Dr. Morgan's word we're asking the court to rely on. These arehard facts here.''   The hearing came one day after Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va.,introduced a bill that would limit civil contempt of court jailingsin the nation's capital to 18 months. The bill would also apply thelaw retroactively to Morgan's case, which would lead to her freedom.   A House District of Columbia subcommittee plans to scheduleadditional hearings on the matter before voting on it.   Foretich, who attended Wednesday's appeals court ruling, saidafterward that he was willing to sit down with Sachs and negotiatea settlement that would lead both to Morgan's freedom and the safereturn of his daughter.   If the appeals court frees Morgan, there are no guarantees thathe will see his daughter again, Foretich said.   ``Until we know my daughter is safe, the only tether we have toher is Dr. Morgan's incarceration,'' said Foretich. ``I don'tderive any pleasure from seeing her in jail, but I need to knowwhere my little girl is.''   Appeals court rulings in such cases can take up to two months.None of the judges on the panel offered any indication when aruling would be issued.</TEXT></DOC>
