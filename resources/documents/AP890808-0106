In separate news conferences following an hour-long meeting inRabin's office, Rabin and Goulding disagreed sharply over thewisdom of the abuction of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid from his southLebanon home on July 28.   ``I have to say that the kidnapping of Sheik Obeid does nothelp,'' said Goulding, who reiterated U.N. Secretary-General JavierPerez de Cuellar's earlier pleas that Israel free the clergyman.   Rabin said that Obeid would be held until Israel was able toswap him for 16 foreign hostages and three Israeli soldierscaptured in Lebanon in 1986.   ``We believe that after three and a half years ... of trying tobring about an exchange that failed, we had to have assets thatwill convince them (Shiites) to bring about an exchange andhopefully end the phenomenon of keeping hostage Israelis andnon-Israelis,'' Rabin said.   Rabin said Israel has received no response through theInternational Committee of the Red Cross to its offer to swap Obeidfor the missing Israeli soldiers and foreign hostages in Lebanon.   He added: ``I will not relate myself to whatever comes on themedia in the name of fake names of Shiite organizations inLebanon.''   Israel's swap offer has been rejected in statements issued inLebanon in the name of Hezbollah, or Party of God, militia andvarious factions of the group.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Tuesday described Israel'sefforts to retrieve its missing soldiers as a national ``moralcommandment.''   He told a graduation ceremony for army officers at the NationalDefense College that Israel was committed ``to do everythingpossible in order to bring back the soldiers imprisoned by thebands of enemies.''   Goulding is on the final part of a week-long tour of the region,which also took him to Syria and Lebanon for talks with politicaland militia leaders. He was sent to try to determine the fate ofU.S. Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins.   Higgins was serving with the U.N. observer force in southernLebanon when he was kidnapped in February 1988. TheHezbollah-affiliated faction holding Higgins released a videotapeJuly 31 purporting to show him hanged.   The FBI said Monday it believes the body shown in the tape wasHiggins but that there can be no positive identification withoutphysical evidence. It offered no information about the time orcause of death.   Rabin told Goulding that Israel believed Higgins died last yearas a result of mistreatment, according to sources who demandedanonymity.   Goulding said that in his talks in Lebanon, ``I was unable toestablish exactly when he died. Opinions differ about that.''   Asked if he was satisfied with findings showing Higgins wasdead, Goulding said, ``I have seen the findings of the FBI, whohave professional forensic scientists who examined the evidence andreached that conclusion.''   Goulding declined comment when asked if he had relayed a messagefrom Hezbollah spiritual leader Sheik Hussein Mohammed Fadlallah inBeirut.   After an earlier meeting with U.S. Ambassador William Brown,Goulding was asked about reports in the Jerusalem Post that anotherAmerican hostage in Lebanon, Joseph Cicippio, might be releasedsoon as a ``goodwill gesture.'' Goulding said he had no informationthat this was the case.   Cicippio, who was threatened with death until the U.S.intervened with an international diplomatic offensive, worked atthe American University of Beirut. He has been a captive sinceSept. 12, 1986.   Goulding said he would meet with the U.N. secretary-generalWednesday to report on his trip.   Rabin said Tuesday's meeting took place at Goulding's requestand that he had given the U.N. official what information Israel hadon Higgins.   He said he also described Israel's ``moral and practicalcommitment'' to bringing home soldiers missing in action.   ``We would like to turn our achievement _ having Sheik Obeid inour hands _ to an end of the hostage episode for Israelis andWesterners.   Rabin said the next step in the process should be receiving areport on the health of the three missing Israeli servicemen. Theyare soldiers Yossi Fink and Rahamin Alsheikh, captured Feb. 17,1986, in Israel's ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon, and RonArad, a navigator whose plane went down over southern Lebanon onOct. 16, 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
