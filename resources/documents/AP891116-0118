Six priests were tortured and killed in amassacre at a Roman Catholic school.   One church leader said the brutal slayings were probably thework of rightist death squads. But a priest at the scene saiduniformed soldiers were spotted entering the priests' residencebefore the shooting began.   The government and armed forces denied that any troops wereinvolved.   Nearly 700 people have died in the fighting in and around SanSalvador.   The resounding boom of army mortars and reports from assaultrifles echoed across the capital, with fire from the Zacamilneighborhood on the northern edge almost continuous from shortlybefore 4 a.m. until dawn.   Red tracer bullets and orange flares dropped by circlinghelicopters lighted the night sky.   Light tanks were seen heading toward the embattled district.   A-37 fighter-bombers screamed low over the city in several runswestward, presumably toward rebel positions near the western suburbof Merliot, where fighting was heavy Wednesday night.   Deafening explosions following the swoops gave the impressionthe planes were dropping 250-pound or 500-pound bombs on insurgentsconcentrated on the lower slopes of the San Salvador volcano.   The six Jesuit priests were slain at about 3 a.m., their facesdisfigured and their brains removed from their skulls at the homethey shared on adjoining the grounds of Jose Simeon Canas CentralAmerican University, one of the region's most prestigiousinsitutions of higher learning. The victims were tortured, thenshot to death, officials said.   ``If this spiral of violence continues, death and destructionwill sweep away many, especially those who are of most use to ourpeople,'' San Salvador's Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas said afterleading a prayer over the mutilated bodies.   Eduardo Valdez, Director of Jesuit Studies, said the Jesuits hadreceived many anonymous threats in past days and that a rightistdeath squad was probably responsible for the killings. The extremeright has for more than a decade accused the Jesuit order and itsuniversity of fostering subversive leftist ideology.   A Jesuit priest who spoke on condition of anonymity toldjournalists at the site of the massacre that a witness saw about 30uniformed soldiers enter the university grounds and the priests'residence shortly before the shots rang out.   ``There have been soldiers posted at the gate since Sunday. Themurders were committed in the middle of a curfew. The same housewhere they were killed was raided and searched by soldiers onTuesday,'' said the priest.   The Rev. Jose Maria Tojeira, the Jesuit Provincial for CentralAmerica, identified the slain priests as Ignacio Ellacuria, theuniversity rector; Ignacio Martin-Baro, the vice-rector; SegundoMontes, Amando Lopez, Juan Ramon Moreno and Joaquin Lopez Lopez.   Tojeira said their domestic servant and her daughter were alsokilled.   ``They did not want to leave witnesses,'' said Valdez.   A dusk-to-dawn curfew prevented travel to the combat zones untildaybreak, and it was not immediately clear if the sustained firewas causing heavy casualties.   The rebels had fortified positions in several six-storylow-income apartment blocks in Zacamil. Most civilians hadevacuated the buildings by late Wednesday, but scores remained inthe dwellings.   As of Wednesday night, More than 680 soldiers, rebels andcivilians had been killed and another 1,600 wounded in the pitchedfighting, according to hospital, morgue and government sources.   Among them, at least 100 civilians have been killed and 800injured, the sources said. The fighting has been concentrated indensely populated working-class districts on the capital'soutskirts.   On Wednesday, government troops drove insurgents from someoutlying capital districts, but rebels repelled repeated armyassaults in others.   Though the government held an advantage in numbers and weaponry,many rebel units held their ground in fierce fighting while others,forced into retreat, regrouped to strike again.   Since the offensive began Saturday, government troops haveapparently not shelled or bombed rebel positions, likely for fearof inflicting high civilian casualties.   The government of rightist President Alfredo Cristiani hasaccused the guerrillas of shielding themselves behind civilians.   But that has not stopped government soldiers from rocketing andstrafing rebel strongholds from helicopters and airplanes, damagingand wrecking thousands of homes in the city's northern reaches.   Many civilians in neighborhoods held by guerrillas have beencaught in the crossfire as government forces have raked rebelpositions with large caliber machine-gun fire or rocketed fromaloft.   The U.S. Embassy said the dead include 146 soldiers and 434guerrillas, while 362 soldiers and 457 rebels have been wounded.   The government, which on Sunday decreed a state of siegesuspending most constitutional guarantees, tightened limits onfreedom of expression Wednesday with a directive sent to all localmedia.   Salvadoran media are prohibited from publishing any communiquesissued by the rebels or by any group that circulates word on rebelactivities.   The rebels claimed to hold about a quarter of the country andradio correspondents in the countryside said fighting continuedWednesday in and around the provincial capitals of San Miguel,Santa Ana and Zacatecoluca.   In the capital, several hundred rebels, including two topcommanders, were dug in Wednesday at the northern district ofMejicanos.   The scene there differed from that in Zacamil and Soyapango _other guerrilla strongholds in recent days _ in that most Mejicanosresidents have stayed on in their homes and many appear alignedwith the rebels.   In some neighborhoods, residents could be seen feeding andgiving other assistance to rebel fighters.   The rebels say they mounted the offensive, their largest since1981, largely in response to a series of attacks on leftistcivilian leaders that included the bombing of a union hall Oct. 31that claimed 10 lives.   Many leaders of union, peasant and student organizationsconsidered guerrilla fronts by the government have gone undergroundthis week.   The 10-year-old civil war between the rebel front and asuccession of U.S.-backed governments has claimed the lives ofabout 70,000 people, most of them civilians.</TEXT></DOC>
