AFRICA WILL FIELD INTEGRATED '92 TEAM  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     South Africa's last Olympic appearance was at the 1960 Summer Games inRome, when the team was all-white because of the government's apartheidpolicies. Next year's team is certain to feature black distance runners andboxers, and blacks may represent other sports as well.;   &quot;This is the firsttime we can say that South Africa is taking part in the Olympic Games,&quot;Ramsamy said. &quot;For the first time we can get a team that will have the supportof all of South Africa.&quot;;   Despite its long absence from internationalcompetition, South Africa could field medal contenders in track and field,boxing, yachting and several other sports.;   All major sports have beenintegrated at the top level, but some governing bodies are still in theprocess of racial unification.;   The Olympic Committee also resolved thesensitive issue concerning the flag and anthem that will accompany the SouthAfrican squad. Many anti-apartheid groups feel the official flag and anthemsymbolize white domination and are unacceptable.;   Ramsamy said the SouthAfrican squad would march under the Olympic anthem -- Beethoven's &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;-- rather than the South African national anthem.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Johannesburg, South Africa  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911107  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6G  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  240  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, November 7, 199100312161,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
