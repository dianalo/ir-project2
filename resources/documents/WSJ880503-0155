The Nikkei index gained 160.18 points to close at 27669.72, reaching a record for the third time in six sessions.    Steel and heavy industrial issues such as shipbuilder Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries were firmer in busy trading, along with electricals.    Traders said that after a morning dominated by the trading of brokerage dealers, activity picked up as some institutional investors joined in during the afternoon to help the market double its gains of the morning session.    &quot;Quite obviously, a few investment managers are away for the holidays,&quot; said one trader. &quot;The heavy activity in steels and shipbuilders is probably a reflection of that.&quot;    However, he added that &quot;we did pretty good volume, especially for the day before holidays. I'd be loath to attribute all of it to dealers.&quot;    The Tokyo stock market will be closed Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday for national holidays.    The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index rose 17.69 to 2213.08. Volume on the first section was estimated at 900 million shares.    Some institutional investors joined the brokerages in what many traders saw as a move to take positions ahead of a string of earnings reports coming out shortly after the end of this week's holidays.    Traders said most electricals were higher, led again by heavy trading in Toshiba, which renewed its record high by rising 8 yen to 888 yen ($7.10) on estimated volume of 55 million shares.    Trading in Toshiba was suspended several times during the afternoon session because of an excess of buy orders.    Among other electricals, OKI Electric surged 43 to 941. Traders said that OKI joined Toshiba in posting sharp gains partly on similar expectations of improvements in earnings amid booming semiconductor demand.    Among heavy industrials, Ishikawajima-Harima was up 10 to 835, while Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was 20 higher at 740. Kobe Steel rose 19 to 351, while Tokyo Steel was up 110 yen to 3,570 yen.    Share prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange closed slightly lower in what brokers called extremely listless trading.    Activity came nearly to a standstill as most investors turned their backs to the market, they said. Bank holidays in London and Tokyo contributed to the lethargic mood.    The market virtually ignored a flurry of positive factors, such as the rise in the dollar above 1.68 marks in Frankfurt and a fairly positive growth forecast by West Germany's five leading economic research institutes.    Interest rate fears continued to undermine confidence in the market, despite a stabilization in West German bond prices Monday and a general consensus among analysts that the central bank won't increase its money market rates soon, observers said.    The government's announcement that it will launch the privatization of its remaining 60% stake in energy, aluminium and chemicals group Viag on Tuesday had little impact because it was expected. The offering is likely to be well-received by the market. Viag's shares eased 1.3 marks to 210.7 ($125.60).    Among internationally traded shares, Dresdner Bank had the largest loss on selected foreign selling, falling 4.10 marks to 237.90. Deutsche Bank slid 2.2 to 407.8, while Commerzbank was flat at 226.    Electrical share AEG rose 2.6 to 207.3 on reported buying by Daimler-Benz above its 200 marks-a-share tender offer. Siemens declined 1.3 to 339.7.    Most other blue-chip stocks were down 2 marks or less in generally random price movements. Chemical issues Hoechst and Schering eased 2 each to 252.2 and 449, respectively.    Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Paris and Stockholm, mixed in Zurich and Amsterdam and lower in Milan. The Brussels exchange was closed for a holiday.    Among Pacific markets, stocks were higher in Taipei and Seoul and mixed in Hong Kong, Manila, Sydney and Wellington. The Singapore market was closed.    Sydney share prices drifted in thin trading as participants attempted to unravel the consequences of Robert Holmes a Court's sale of his controlling interest in Bell Group. Brokers said investors remained passive in the absence of leads from abroad.
