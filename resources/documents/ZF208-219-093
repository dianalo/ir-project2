(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Cutting Through Network ControlandM;When ATandamp;T and the U.S.andP;  government announced their now historic agreement tobreak up the Bell system, many in industry predicted the dawning of a new erain communications.andP;  And a symbol of the new independence was to be thedevelopment of private corporate networks run by the users of those networksthemselves.andM;For several years, that is exactly what happened.andP;  Corporations investedmillions of dollars in private networks.andP;  And this year, they will investwhat some analysts estimate to be about $8 billion on private facilities andequipment, a figure that is gradually increasing.andM;Now, however, a small but prominent group of corporations, includingCopperweld Corp., General Electric Co., H.J.andP;  Heinz Co. and Ford Motor Co.,andO;areandM;letting go of their corporate networks.andP;   WhetherandM;such companies are contracting with outsiders to design and run the corporatenetwork; moving from private to public network facilities; or choosing asingle, companywide communications carrier, the result is the often same:goodbye to staff and support headaches, hello to outside network managers andoperators.andM;Reasons for the switch range from promises of cutting costs, a company's badfinancial health, upheavals such as a buy-out, displeasure with the work doneby the in-house communications department or the hope for improved service.andM;For corporate telecommunications managers and IS managers, this transfer ofoperational control control over voice and data networks that operate bothinternally and externally can produce real benefits.andP;  Saving direct operatingcosts as well as salaries, reducing management time and effort for overseeingthese networks, and, as a result, gaining the ability to better focus on acompany's core business are all potential benefits.andM;Nevertheless, the decision to give up internal network control is often not apopular one with IS managers.andP;  &quot;Often times, this private network is thepride and joy of the datacom or telecom manager, and going to another partyis the exact opposite direction he'd like to go,&quot; says Kenneth Bosomworth,president of International Resource Development Inc. in New Canaan, Conn.andM;And there could be more at stake than meets the eye.andP;  Reducing direct controlover a corporate network could result in a company that's out of touch with afundamental element of today's business environment.andP;  The corporate networkhas become one of the most important ways to communicate with suppliers andcustomers through everything from simple telephone communications toelectronic data interchange.andP;  Day-to-day operation of a network, theso-called grunt work, can be a source of potentially valuable informationabout new market opportunities and can be the basis of developing newrelationships with customers and suppliers.andM;Networks Under ReviewandM;While these network arrangements are only just beginning to emerge, theyparallel the current trend among information systems managers to shiftsystems development and operations to third-party service companies andintegrators.andM;&quot;Those days are gone when maybe you owned all the switches and had anorganization of 150 [telecom] people,&quot; says Stanley Welland, manager ofcorporate telecommunications for GE in Fairfield, Conn.andP;  &quot;We're not in thetelephone business, so why do things that carriers can do better?&quot;andM;&quot;A lot of large companies would have developed a corporate telcommunicationsdepartment that, in effect, manages, orders lines and engineers a network.andO;You really don't need to do that if you can get a vendor,&quot; confirms PhilipLichtenfels, a senior consultant for H.J.andP;  Heinz of Pittsburgh.andM;Lichtenfels feels he has found such a vendor in Genix Corp.andP;  In June, Heinzsigned a three-year, $15 million contract under which Pittsburgh-based Genixwill take over data-processing and network operations for the food giant.andO;Roughly 30% of the contract is for communications, such as establishing ahigh-speed T1 network.andP;  At the same time, Heinz is moving from amultisupplier voice network to an all-ATandamp;T Software-Defined Network (SDN).andO;However, the T1 data network could be supplied by an ATandamp;T competitor.andM;As a result of these contractual arrangements, Heinz will soon have nocommunications staff at its headquarters.andP;  At each subsidiary, the companywill retain a technical person who will be primarily responsible foroverseeing the operations of a local area network.andP;  Each subsidiary's LANprovides services specific to its manufacturing operations.andM;Economics of OutsourcingandM;&quot;People always argue that I'll lose flexibility, control and that I'll not beable to manage and change priorities the way I could before,&quot; saysLichtenfels.andP;  &quot;You don't lose anything.andP;  You gain economies of scale andbetter utilization of technical resources.&quot;andM;Heinz is just starting off, and only time will tell if Lichtenfels' faith isrewarded.andP;  However, others a bit further down th eoutsourcing trail havebecome somewhat more cautious about relinquishing complete control to athird-party network operator.andM;An example of one that had some second thoughts is steel tubing and bimetalwire manufacturer Copperweld.andP;  Financial problems caused the Pittsburgh-basedcompany to leave the driving to Genix in 1986.andP;  &quot;Everybody was under ordersto reduce costs and downsize the company,&quot; recalls Barry Fink, Copperweld'sdata-processing manager.andP;  The firm moved its data lines out and hired Genix'stelecom support group to monitor the network and to chase down and solveproblems.andP;  When Copperweld initially went to Genix, the steel company didn'tkeep a dedicated networking person on staff.andP;  Now, after two and a halfyears, it has hired its own telecom supervisor and a local area networkmanager.andM;One part of Genix's business is facilities management for customers such asHeinz and Copperweld.andP;  Another is remote computing services.andP;  Copperweldhired the telecom supervisor out of worry that Genix was paying moreattention to its own remote computing network than to its customers'networks.andP;  Having its own telecom supervisor guarantees Copperweld that moreattention will be paid to strategic network planning and preventive networkmaintenance, says Fink.andP;  Fink also believes that an in-house LAN manager isneeded, since the technology is close to the end user.andM;&quot;Initially, when Genix found out we were hiring a network person, they weresomewhat taken aback,&quot; recalls Fink.andP;  &quot;We knew that we needed the comfortlevel of having one of our own [people involved].&quot;andP;  Thus Copperweld feels ithas regained some measure of control by having its own expert examineoperational reprots on a routine basis.andM;Nonetheless, outsourcing has been good for Copperweld overall, Fink says.andO;Although Copperweld's finances have improved, the company recently renewedits contract with Genix through 1991.andP;  Fink lauds Genix for introducinginnovations such as a support center to coordinate user problems.andP;  In fact,several companies cite such organizational improvements as part of the allureof using third-party managers.andM;As was the case with Copperweld, the shift to outside network operations is,in general, not a wholesale operation.andP;  &quot;We haven't seen a huge number ofusers turn over this [network operations] functions, certainly not lock,stock and barrel,&quot; says Berge Ayvazian, vice president of communicationsresearch at the market research firm The Yankee Group in Boston.andM;Rather, a fine line is evolving between what users will and won't want tolose in the bargain.andP;  &quot;Network control is one area that companies don't wantto give up, as well as strategic applications development.andP;  Still they arewilling to give up certain network management functions,&quot; Ayvazian says.andM;&quot;There is a firm distinction between control and operations,&quot; agrees WilliamGilbert, division manager for ATandamp;T's Network Management Systems operations inBridgewater, N.J.andP;  &quot;The management prerogative is that performance parametersare met.andP;  Who pushes the buttons, who does the operational jobs--the gruntwork--is really less important.&quot;andM;Newer network technologies enable that distinction to be drawn, allowingusers to receive better information about telecom services even when theservice is operated elsewhere, Gilbert adds.andP;  Users have generally measuredcorporate telecom performance by just two statistics: availability and numberandM;of user complaints.andP;   Vendors now can deliverandM;more network performance data than users are producing themselves.andO;Furthermore, such services as network testing and fault isolation are moreeconomically performed by vendors.andM;&quot;When we finish, customers have more control over us than they do over theirin-house people,&quot; says Cecil Sexton, senior vice president at Genix.andO;Corporations often are loathe, or legally unable, to fire employees who makemistakes, he says.andP;  And corporations do not generally make contracts bindingtheir employees to meet specific network performance levels, as they do withoutside vendors.andM;Although some users accept Sexton's argument, others don't.andP;  Relying on avendor creates its own ties.andP;  &quot;Once you depend on a vendor, it becomes amarriage.andP;  This is no longer hand-holding,&quot; says a telecom executive at amajor New York City bank that recently assigned management and maintenance ofits network to San Jose-based Tymnet/McDonnell Douglas Network Systems Co.andM;&quot;Can we manage the vendor through our contracting office?andP;  All we can do iscancel the contract,&quot; continues the executive, who asked that neither he norhis employer be named.andP;  Relationships can be terminated, but someone stillhas to run the network.andP;  The bank would have to find another vendor in ahurry or else staff up like crazy, he says.andM;For the price the bank is paying, it could do just as good a job with its ownpeople, this executive believes.andP;  Yet, the bank is reluctant to make thelong-term commitment in capital and personnel that an in-house operationwould require.andM;Real Cost SavingsandM;Some companies have confirmed significant cost savings by depending onvendors.andP;  James Soma, telecommunications services manager for Ford Motor Co.andO;in Dearborn, Mich., estimates that the auto giant has pared 10% off itstelecommunications bill by turning over network operations to a singlevendor.andM;Ford was one of the earliest compa(ies to sign up with ATandamp;T for what's becomeknown as Tariff 12 services--multiyear contracts under which ATandamp;T guaranteesa level of performance at agreed upon prices.andP;  In some cases, though not atFord, ATandamp;T takes over ownership of the customer's communications equipment.andO;Under Tariff 12, the customer frequently decides to make ATandamp;T its sole or itsprimary carrier.andM;Since it's an all-ATandamp;T network, Ford believes ATandamp;T should run it.andP;  &quot;The ATandamp;Tpeople have access to proprietary information and databases where wewoudln't,&quot; says Soma of the decision to consolidate its networkrelationships.andP;  &quot;They see problems sooner than we would.&quot;andM;The result is that network availabi lity has increased and costs havedeclined since ATandamp;T came on board.andP;  Availability on Ford's data network hasincreased to 99.68% since ATandamp;T began operating the network.andP;  Previously,availability had averaged 99.20%.andM;Ford is careful to retain direct control of network planning.andP;  The companymaintains a planning staff and sees itself as responsible for providingdirection to ATandamp;T.andM;Single-Vendor DependenceandM;The auto maker is also concerned that dependence on a single vendor couldresult in vulnerability.andP;  To reduce its vulnerability, Ford is, for example,insisting on employing alternate routing paths for the company's backbonenetwork.andP;  The work ensures that single failures won't disrupt networkoperations.andP;  Such assurances, however, may end up costing Ford more moneythan it originally budgeted.andM;That is also the case at GE, another ATandamp;T Tariff 12 customer.andO;Telecommiunications manager Welland says some critical network hubs are beingserved by multiple vendors.andP;  And since the original contract, GE hasrenegotiated with ATandamp;T on a bandwidth management system, which providestraffic rerouting.andM;This summer, Kemper Financial Co. and Paine-Webber Inc. each signed up forTariff 12 services under five-year contracts totaling $100 million.andP;  Recentcustomers of Tariff 12 and similar arrangements with ATandamp;T's competitors havethe benefit of their predecessors' experience and have not hesitated toinsist on closer control.andP;  Many are negotiating their contracts to include asecond carrier as a network backup.andP;  Others, mindful of the constant drop intelecom prices, are negotiating pricing flexibility into their contracts.andP;  Asone of the earliest signers, Ford was supposed to be locked into a fixedrate, but ATandamp;T has since dropped some prices as a courtesy to Ford.andM;Regardless of how flexible vendors may appear, the fact remains that, for thetelecommunications vendors, the primary point of these deals is to obtainaccount control through long-term contracts.andP;  Although the carriers provideprice incentives for companies to concentrate their business over a longperiod of time, the possibility of a loss of control isn't ignored bycustomers.andM;Take, for example, network management.andP;  Since some vendors are pushing theirown network management architectures, they may exert a great deal ofinfluence over a customer's network management evolution.andM;Yet most user companies claim that third-party network service contractsdon't force specific vendor equipment purchases upon them.andP;  &quot;I think theshort answer is probably not in a(y overt way,&quot; says ATandamp;T's Gilbert, whenasked whether vendors guide users on equipment.andM;Some customers may not object to such technical guidance, feeling that theirvendor knows better.andP;  This willingness to accept a third party'srecommendation applies not only to what private network equipment to choosebut also to whether to move some operations to public networks.andM;&quot;We put in a private network initially since there was no public networkwhere we needed it,&quot; says the bank executive.andP;  &quot;We could now review thedecision to go more public.andP;  Plus new technology will [make] obsolete what wehave in two to three years.&quot;andM;Technical ObsolescenceandM;This obsolescence is a potential ace in the hole for some suppliers.andO;&quot;Technology is becoming obsolete faster, and the economies of scaleassociated in keeping up with the changes are harder to find,&quot; commentsYankee Group's Ayvazian.andP;  If carriers can keep up quicker they have anadvantage, he says.andM;No one is suggesting that private networks, where control undoubtedly restswith the customer, will be dumped wholesale for public networks.andP;  Rather,hybrid networks, incorporating elements of both, will become morecommonplace.andP;  This is particularly likely because of public software-definednetworks, which enable users to customize public networks to their own needs.andM;Still even the vendors recognize that the biggest single unresolved issue inhanding over a company's network to an outside party is the matter ofcontrol.andP;  As Genix's Sexton says: &quot;You're taking something perceived as anintegral part of the house, and you're giving it up.&quot;andP;  But given the enormoussums of money spent on communications--some $80 billion this year, accordingto International Resource Development--many companies are demanding, notasking, that communications staff cut costs while maintaining a high level ofservice.andP;  These pressures guarantee that, although companies may not want togive up complete control, the definition of that control may be changing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
