Long distance networks (WAN), ranging fromtens to hundreds of kilometers, offer a variety of possibilities, fromstandard 64 Kbit/s connections to optical fiber links and radio or satelliteMbit channels. Short range (up to 2-3 km) communications are offeredby many existing LAN (local area network) standards up to 10 Mbit/s.The medium distance range (around 10 km) can be covered by high performancefiber optic links and the now emerging MAN (metropolitan area network)protocols. A possible area of application is between the Gran Sasso TunnelLaboratory, the outside installations and other Italien and foreign laboratories.</TEXT></DOC>
