The pilot plant for brown coal liquefactionwill be constructed and operated. The identification of ranks of coal,purification of liquefied oil and environmental protective measures willbe investigated. A 7000 Nm{sup 3}/d-high calorie fuel gas productingplant by coal gasification and the combined cycle power generation usinglow calorie gas will be developed. An entrained flow coal gasificationand hydrogen producing pilot plants will be investigated. The low-costsilicon manufacturing process and improvement of efficiency in the fieldof solar energy will be studied for developing the practical solar cellsystem. A several hundreds KW-wind power generation plant will be designedaiming at the optimum conditions. A 10 MW-geothermal power generationdemonstration plant of binary system and hot dry rock will be studied.The commercialization of a phosphoric acid fuel cell will be investigatedand molten carbonate fuel cell will be manufactured on an experimentalbasis. The study on the optimum application system of the general purposestarling engine and heat pump will be continued and the geothermal andcoal resources will be further examined.</TEXT></DOC>
