(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Association of Evangelicals isconcerned about the effect of financial and sexual wrongdoings bytelevision preachers on young people, marriages and moralprinciples.   ``We express ... deep disappointment and sorrow over some recenthighly publicized moral lapses,'' the NAE leadership said in astatement at its conference this week.   All of those interviewed were quick to agree that the recentconfession of sexual episodes by Jimmy Swaggart and the earlierallegations of sexual and financial wrongdoing by Jim Bakker wereexceptional cases. But they worried about the aftereffects.   Jeffrey K. Hadden, professor of sociology at the University ofVirginia, said the repercussions from the recent scandals that haveplagued the industry are numerous.   ``There will be more investigations,'' Hadden said. ``There area lot of people around who would like to get these guys. It's sortof open season.''   He noted that a House subcommittee was looking into possibleviolations of postal regulations governing direct-mailsolicitations and said the Internal Revenue Service and FederalCommunications Commission would probably uncover other wrongdoings.   There was also concern among members of the National ReligiousBroadcasters, an affiliate of the NAE, about reports of an increasein the number of television stations dropping religious programmingas a result of the Swaggart case.   Gerry Leonard of Orlando, central Florida coordinator of ateaching ministry called Evangelism Explosion, said she gets manyquestions from people concerned about television evangelism.   ``We don't throw stones or put anybody down because these areevents caused by individuals, not the church,'' she said. ``But Itell them to carefully study what the Bible teaches, not whatsomebody represents it to be.''   ``These TV preachers have to answer for their own sins,'' saidMilton Russ, who runs an agency that aids churches in theirfund-raising activities. ``We make sure that what we're doing isright. ... They should too.''   He said that those who avidly follow and give their financialsupport to TV ministries ``have no real strong ties to localchurches. They just do not personally want to get involved. ...Whenever one of them (TV preachers) gets in trouble, they justswitch channels and go on to the other guy.''</TEXT></DOC>
