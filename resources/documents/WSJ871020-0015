The dollar's sudden reversal was in response to a Treasury Department statement late in the afternoon that Secretary James Baker met with West German monetary officials and smoothed out their policy differences, agreeing to continue &quot;cooperation on exchange rate stability.&quot;    Between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. EDT, the dollar soared 1.4% to 1.7968 West German marks from 1.7718. &quot;The net result is, ironically, that the dollar is right where we left it on Friday,&quot; James S. Vick, vice president and senior corporate trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said. He added that much of the late dollar-buying resulted from triggered stop-loss orders left by New York traders who went home with oversold dollar positions on the assumption that the U.S. currency would continue downward.    Earlier in the day in overseas trading, the dollar plunged 1.4% against the mark and fell sharply against other major currencies.    In early Australian trading today, the dollar continued its rally, rising to 1.8065 marks.    Surprisingly, the losses by the dollar earlier yesterday all occurred before the collapse in the U.S. stock market. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average had by far its worst point loss ever, the dollar actually recovered slightly against some major currencies.    The dollar's buoyancy under the weight of the stock market's collapse was attributed to sharp declines in overseas equity markets, making the alternatives to dollar investments unattractive. &quot;It's not just one equity market going down, it's the world equity markets that are going down. So if you want to take your dollars somewhere else, where do you take them?&quot; James T. McGroarty, vice president of foreign exchange at Discount Corp. of New York, said.    Arthur C. Agostini, vice president and chief foreign exchange dealer at Manufacturers Hanover, added that &quot;there's a feeling that if you have to be in a crashing market, it's better to be in one in the U.S.&quot;    The Treasury Department's statement concerning Secretary Baker's meeting yesterday with West German finance officials dispelled concern that the U.S. was abandoning its policy of maintaining a stable dollar. Those concerns were raised by Mr. Baker's criticism of West German interest rate increases and statements in recent days indicating a willingness to let the dollar fall.    But late yesterday the Treasury Department said Mr. Baker met in Frankfurt with West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl and that the parties &quot;agreed to continue economic cooperation under the Louvre agreement and its flexible application, including cooperation on exchange rate stability and monetary policies.&quot;    The Louvre accord, signed last February by the Group of Seven nations, or G-7, set trading ranges for the dollar against major currencies. The Treasury statement added that the officials are &quot;consulting with their G-7 colleagues and are confident that this will enable them to foster exchange rate stability around current levels.&quot;    Before the late flurry of buying yesterday, the dollar was down 1.4% from its Friday level against the mark, and 0.8% against the Japanese yen. In afternoon New York trading Monday, the U.S. currency stood at 1.7718 marks, down from 1.7975 Friday, and 141.33 yen, off from 142.45. Earlier Monday in Asia the dollar traded as low as 1.7680 marks and 140.45 yen.    The dollar was quoted at 143.10 yen in early Tokyo trading today.    Some traders suspected that the dollar's sharp drop overseas and the rout in stock markets around the world would probably move the major industrial nations toward closer economic cooperation. &quot;The situation that we see now is really on the verge of financial panic, and I don't think that's something that the U.S. or the G-7 had in mind,&quot; Mr. McGroarty said, referring to the Group of Seven nations that signed the Louvre accord.    After plunging overseas, the dollar surprised traders with its ability to hold its own in the face of the collapsing U.S. stock market.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery soared $10.10 an ounce to $481.70 in very heavy trading. The estimated volume was nine million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $475.75 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Monday, Oct. 19, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
