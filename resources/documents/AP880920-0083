The City Council voted 12-5 Monday for a measure which asks thecity attorney's office to seek court injunctions against leaders ofOperation Rescue, the group that organized the protests.   The measure does not interfere with the right to picket and tofree speech, council members said.   Barbara Magera, a staff member of Operation Rescue in Atlanta,said the decision would not deter the group, which has takenSeptember off from the protests but vows to return in October.   She said similar actions were taken in New York and inPhiladelphia, but protests continued.   The protests that began during the Democratic NationalConvention in July clogged the city's legal system, putting morethan 700 people in jail and costing Atlanta more than $500,000,said Barbara Asher, chairwoman of the city's Public SafetyCommission and sponsor of Monday's resolution.   ``They are trying to grind the machinery of this city to ahalt,'' Mrs. Asher said.   Councilman Hosea Williams said he planned to challenge theconstitutionality of the decision in court. The civil rights leadercompared it to laws passed in the past to deny rights to blacks.   ``This is a very dangerous bill,'' Williams said. ``It's goingto put Atlanta in such a bad light.''   However, Councilman Jabari Simama said the bill ``will not denythis group's rights to exercise its First Amendment rights.''</TEXT></DOC>
