In the first six days of December, 11,625 East Germansregistered to resettle in their rich western neighbor, bringing thetotal number of East German immigrants to about 312,000, the WestGerman Interior Ministry said Thursday.   Under West Germany's constitution, East Germans are grantedautomatic citizenship.   The December exodus is small compared with the 10,000 or moreEast Germans who left daily via Czechoslovakia shortly before EastGermany _ hoping to stem the flow _ opened the Berlin Wall and itsother borders to West Germany on Nov. 9.   The stream fell to about 1,500 a day by late November but pickedup again during the last two weeks as uncertainty about thecountry's future increased.   Ina Ruehl, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Bonn, said no end to theexodus is in sight.   ``We all thought the trend would be downward, but that didn'thappen,'' she said in a telephone interview. ``The future isuncertain. Of course a lot depends on political developments inEast Germany.''   Former Communist Party Chief Egon Krenz ordered travelrestrictions lifted so citizens wouldn't have to flee, but Krenzhas been ousted in the second leadership reshuffle in six weeks.   The government now has promised to grant free elections andbroad political freedoms.   Only a small fraction of the millions of who have visited WestBerlin and West Germany after the opening of frontiers decided tostay. But East Germany's struggling economy can not afford thesteady drain of mostly young, educated workers.   Shortages of medical personnel already have been reported inEast Germany, and an East Berlin newspaper warned last week thatthe country faced a ``collapse of society'' if the exodus does notstop.   Berliner Zeitung said citizens were leaving because authoritieswere not moving quickly enough against corruption.   About 700 East Germans are crossing every day to West Berlin, anon-Communist island in the middle of East Germany. Emergencyshelters are stretched to the limit and resentment is building.   West Berlin said Nov. 28 it would accept only East Germans whocan prove they are joining parents or children. Other resettlersare being sent to West Germany.   The announcement has not reduced the numbers of people coming toWest Berlin, said Rita Hermanns, spokeswoman for the city's socialand health services authority.   ``We cannot keep all school gymnasiums of this city occupiedindefinitely,'' she said. ``We would certainly like to use them forsports again.''</TEXT></DOC>
