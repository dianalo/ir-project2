Tmax is definedas the pyrolysis temperature at which a maximum amount of hydrocarboncompounds coming from the thermal degradation of kerogen is released.After a critical analysis of the Tmax parameter (operating conditions,effect of mineral matrix, etc...), concrete cases are used to proposea scale of correspondence between Tmax and different stages of oil andgas formation for each of the three major types of organic matter.</TEXT></DOC>
