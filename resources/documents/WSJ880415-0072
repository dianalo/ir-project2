C. Olivetti andamp; Co.    Mr. De Benedetti said this week in Turin that Olivetti executives shed tears of joy when he told them that he would remain as Olivetti's chairman and that he had forbidden American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. to raise its 22% stake in the Italian computer maker. He added: &quot;I cannot accept that Olivetti would become a unit of ATandamp;T.&quot;    Yet on this side of the Atlantic, ATandamp;T executives tell a different story. &quot;Mr. De Benedetti initiated the talks,&quot; says an ATandamp;T spokesman, who notes that ATandamp;T hasn't any right to raise its stake above 25% before 1990. In fact, ATandamp;T sources say that Mr. De Benedetti, strapped for cash by his costly battle for control of Societe Generale de Belgique, had proposed in February that ATandamp;T should raise its stake in the Italian computer maker to some 40%, and eventually take control of it. &quot;Mr. De Benedetti,&quot; says Jack B. Grubman, a PaineWebber Inc. analyst in New York who closely follows ATandamp;T, &quot;is living in dream land.&quot;    No matter which side's account of events is more accurate, they both point to a similar conclusion: The vaunted late-1983 courtship between the U.S. telecommunications giant and Europe's second largest office equipment maker is rocky again, as it has often been in its four years.    Rumors that ATandamp;T might sell its stake have surfaced in Milan. ATandamp;T paid $260 million for the stake (originally 25% but now 22% because of dilution), which is valued at close to $1 billion today.    Yet, a split-up would be premature. Though their union hasn't lived up to expectations, ATandamp;T and Olivetti have come to depend on each other. Both have pressing reasons to work out their differences. &quot;You don't want to end things that take a long time to meld,&quot; says one manager in ATandamp;T's Data Systems Group.    ATandamp;T reinforced that yesterday, breaking its weeklong silence with a conciliatory statement acknowledging last weekend's meetings between the two companies. &quot;Olivetti continues to play a key role in ATandamp;T's efforts to develop and market computers and to assume a stronger position in international markets,&quot; ATandamp;T said. &quot;The relationship is a healthy one. As in any such alliance, there may be differences of opinion from time to time.&quot;    Even if both companies were disposed toward a rupture, this is hardly the moment either would choose.    Mr. De Benedetti is absorbed in a crucial phase of his battle for Generale de Belgique, at whose shareholder meeting in Brussels yesterday he failed to win even a board seat but also declined to concede defeat. He also is awaiting the Italian supreme court's decision April 19 on his long-blocked effort to purchase state-owned Societa Meridionale Finanziaria S.p.A., a food conglomerate.    At ATandamp;T, the chairman, James E. Olson, is recuperating from cancer surgery, and President Robert Allen is running the company. He is a low-key, methodical executive who isn't likely to make any snap decisions, especially being new in the top job. ATandamp;T executives are also busy reviewing first-quarter earnings, which the company is expected to issue Wednesday at its annual meeting.    ATandamp;T entered into its Olivetti arrangement four years ago to gain European distribution for its computers and phone equipment. It was less willing to become a U.S. distributor for Olivetti, but Mr. De Benedetti badly wanted that. So, to get the relationship off on the right foot, ATandamp;T scrapped a personal computer project of its own, and agreed to use Olivetti workstations and personal computers for its entry into that U.S. market. &quot;It was a way for Olivetti to get interested in pushing our products in Europe,&quot; one ATandamp;T manager says.    While Mr. De Benedetti has been sorely disappointed with ATandamp;T's U.S. performance, he lacks a ready replacement for U.S. distribution of Olivetti machines. Last year, industry sources say, ATandamp;T sold only 120,000 of the machines in the U.S., many from inventory. While Olivetti's profit got a big boost in 1985 and 1986 from shipments to ATandamp;T, last year ATandamp;T's sharp reduction of orders caused Olivetti's profit to plunge nearly a third. ATandamp;T hopes to sell more this year and Olivetti is depending on that for a recovery of its own.    As for ATandamp;T's view of the bargain, its managers say that while Olivetti's machines fit well with ATandamp;T's U.S. product line, it wouldn't be difficult for ATandamp;T to find another source. ATandamp;T has been dissatisfied, moreover, with Olivetti sales of its 3B2 minicomputers and System 75 phone switchboard lines in Europe. Olivetti also ruffled some ATandamp;T feathers last November when it came out with a line of minicomputers that some analysts say compete with the ATandamp;T machines Olivetti is supposed to sell.    Nonetheless, Olivetti's position as a European distribution outlet still &quot;is critical&quot; to ATandamp;T's international expansion plans, says one ATandamp;T Data Systems executive. &quot;Who else is established like they are in Europe?&quot; he says. &quot;There aren't any alternatives. Starting from scratch in Europe is next to impossible. I'd like to see them sell more 3Bs, but they are selling a reasonable amount.&quot;    Complicating ATandamp;T's options with Olivetti is the fact that it has become highly dependent on a key De Benedetti lieutenant, Vittorio Cassoni, for its computer strategy. Mr. Cassoni, president of Data Systems, was brought into ATandamp;T in 1986 from Olivetti as part of the companies' renegotiated accord. He had been head of Olivetti's U.S. operations.    Mr. Cassoni has revived ATandamp;T's computer business, principally through an agreement to buy 20% of Sun Microsystems Inc., a workstation maker. Sun is helping ATandamp;T market its Unix computer operating company as a major alternative to IBM systems. Analysts say Sun could, in the future, become an alternative to Olivetti as an ATandamp;T supplier of workstations and personal computers.    The Sun linkup also symbolizes a crucial shift in strategy. ATandamp;T, anlaysts say, is less interested now in making individual computer sales than in selling computer networks. But because of Mr. Cassoni's role, says one former ATandamp;T executive, &quot;their whole computer business is dependent on Olivetti at this point.&quot;    A departure of Mr. Cassoni, which had been rumored during the ATandamp;T/Olivetti talks, would seriously damage ATandamp;T's computer business.    Yesterday, both companies appeared to be fighting over him, with Olivetti calling him &quot;our executive on loan&quot; to ATandamp;T and ATandamp;T saying he &quot;absolutely&quot; is an ATandamp;T employee. Asked at a news conference Monday whether rumours of his return to Olivetti held substance, Mr. Cassoni smiled, shook his head and protested, &quot;No, no, no.&quot; He hasn't been available to talk about the matter since.    Despite the two companies' mutual need, some analysts say they fail to see the logic in the alliance. &quot;They are victims of the illusion that computers and telecommunications will converge,&quot; says Hugh Small, a director of Arthur D. Little in London. Mr. Grubman, the New York analyst, says ATandamp;T will find better expansion opportunities in Europe through selling gear to government-run telephone systems than through its Olivetti relationship.    Olivetti wouldn't say who initiated the February talks. But ATandamp;T sources say Mr. De Benedetti proposed selling ATandamp;T part of his 13% stake in the computer maker and increasing ATandamp;T's representation on Olivetti's board from the current six out of 23 members. ATandamp;T was willing to discuss the matter if it could also solve some business problems. Both sides were said to consider it imperative that Mr. De Benedetti remain Olivetti's chairman and that Olivetti not be viewed as a division of ATandamp;T.    But while the ATandamp;T talks were progressing, Mr. De Benedetti raised needed cash through an agreement last month to sell his Buitoni S.p.A.'s assets to Switzerland's Nestle S.A. for 1.8 trillion lire ($1.43 billion). That sale is being challenged in France in behalf of shareholders of Buitoni's French unit. But the sale, and rumors of Mr. De Benedetti's Olivetti pullout, unleashed a tide of negative publicity about his ceding to foreign interests companies that to many Italians are synonomous with Italy.    It also seriously damaged Mr. De Benedetti's self-promoted image, important to his battle for Generale de Belgique, as an &quot;industrialist&quot; rather than a short-term investor. In a hurried meeting last weekend in New York, just days before the Generale de Belgique showdown, the ATandamp;T deal was called off.    In the Milan stock market, rumors are rife that he is buying Olivetti shares. &quot;This story,&quot; says the European banker, echoing statements on the other side of the Atlantic, &quot;isn't over yet.&quot;    ---            ATandamp;T-Olivetti: A Stormy Relationship   December 1983: ATandamp;T agrees to buy up to 25% of Olivetti, or 100 million new shares, for $260 million with an option to raise its stake to 40% beginning in 1988. Having secured distribution in Europe, ATandamp;T begins negotiating to sell Olivetti office products in the U.S.   October 1986: After lengthy negotiations, ATandamp;T and Olivetti renew the alliance until 1996 and ATandamp;T agrees not to raise its Olivetti stake above 25% until October, 1990. Vittorio Cassoni, head of Olivetti's U.S. business, becomes head of ATandamp;T's Computer Systems unit which he renames Data Systems.   October 1987: Mr. Cassoni is promoted to president of Data Systems Group with control of its own computer sales force. ATandamp;T announces a technology agreement with Sun Microsystems Inc., Mountain View, Calif., that includes licensing of a powerful Sun microprocessor for ATandamp;T's next minicomputer line.   January 1988: ATandamp;T agrees to buy up to 20% of Sun for as much as $350 million by buying newly issued shares over three years and buying the remaining 5% stake on the open market.   February 1988: Olivetti solicits an increase in ATandamp;T's holding.   April 1988: The two companies can't agree on conditions for raising ATandamp;T's stake in Olivetti.</TEXT></DOC>
