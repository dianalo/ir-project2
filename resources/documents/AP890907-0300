In a letter to Reps. Neal Smith, D-Iowa, and Harold Rogers,R-Ky., departing SEC Chairman David Ruder said the agency wouldmonitor the battle for London-based BAT, which owns several majorU.S. companies, although it lacked jurisdiction.   Ruder's response led the two lawmakers to issue a joint statementsaying new legislation may now be needed to strenghten the SEC'sability to protect U.S. shareholders.   ``The House is now much more likely to support legislation thatwould ensure that the SEC does have jurisdiction to intervene inthis and other highly leveraged offshore transactions,'' said thetwo legislators.   ``But if the new SEC chairman has different views on the issue,''they said, ``or if the commission asserts jurisdiction as ChairmanRuder indicated they might do if an understanding of the factschanges, new legislation may not be required.''   Ruder has said he will leave the SEC at the end of the month.President Bush has nominated White House assistant Richard Breedento succeed him.   Goldsmith's consortium, Hoylake Investments Ltd., launched a $21billion takeover bid for BAT, the world's largest tobacco company,in late July.   BAT, whose U.S. holdings include the Saks Fifth Avenue andMarshall Field department stores as well as Farmers Insurance Group,has vowed to fight the takeover attempt.</TEXT></DOC>
