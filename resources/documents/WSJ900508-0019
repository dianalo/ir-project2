Announcement of the study will come tomorrow, sourcessaid. Neither company would confirm details.</LP><TEXT>   Both European aircraft builders, as well asgovernment-funded studies in the U.S. and Japan, have beenlooking at supersonic and &quot;hypersonic&quot; aircraft projects formonths. In particular, Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp.are looking at the potential of developing what they call ahigh-speed civil transport, or HSCT. Four years ago, theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration began fundingresearch into the area, and both manufacturers are convincedthat a market exists for an aircraft that could carry 250 to300 passengers up to 6,500 miles at nearly 2.5 times thespeed of sound.   But no plane has been configured at this point. NASA isnow in the midst of a $25 million study to evaluate theenvironmental problems that such an aircraft could cause:Excessive engine noise, ozone depletion and sonic booms. &quot;Wedon't see anything flying before the turn of the century,&quot;said a spokesman for Seattle-based Boeing, which two decadesago watched as its supersonic transport program was canceleddue in large part to economic uncertainties.   In addition, the U.S. Air Force, in cooperation with U.S.aerospace companies, is developing what it calls the NationalAeroSpace Plane, which would be capable of flying in lowEarth orbit at 25 times the speed of sound. And Japan latelast year invited U.S. and other foreign participation in a$200 million Tokyo-funded project to develop an engine for aJapanese civil transport plane that would fly at five timesthe speed of sound.   ---   Rick Wartzman in Los Angeles contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
