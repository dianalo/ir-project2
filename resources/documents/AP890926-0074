Led by officers riding in a U.S.-made jeep and a string ofSoviet-made armored personnel carriers, the troops passed bythousands of schoolchildren waving flags along Highway 1.   The narrow, potholed road was one of the main routes from whichVietnamese forces invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and ended nearlyfour years of Khmer Rouge terror, installing a pro-Hanoi government.   There is widespread fear that the Khmer Rouge, which from 1975to 1978 sent hundreds of thousands of Cambodians to their death asit tried to turn the country into a primitive agrarian commune,could fight its way back to power.   In a radio report received today, Khmer Rouge guerrillas saidthey captured two more positions in western Cambodia and killed orwounded a number of Vietnamese soldiers.   And in a message to his countrymen, Cambodian President HengSamrin today appealed to the army, the Communist Party and thepeople to ``unite as a rock-like bloc'' to prevent the re-emergenceof the Khmer Rouge.   In Ho Chi Minh City today, government officials said Vietnam andCambodia would renegotiate a ``peace and friendship'' treatyimposed on the Cambodian government soon after it was installed.   The treaty, in essence a mutual defense pact, conflicts withCambodia's stated goal of neutrality.   The officials said Vietnamese arms shipments, military adviceand intelligence, will last as long as nations such as China andThailand continue to support the guerrilla resistance front.   Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach today urged a haltto outside military support for Cambodia's warring factions inorder to avert a civil war.   Vietnamese schools were closed to mark the troops' return, andrelatives of soldiers ran across the border at Moc Bai.   ``I am so happy to be leaving Cambodia,'' said a soldier fromCan Tho province as his 3-year-old daughter tugged at his hair.   ``My wife is more beautiful now than ever,'' said anothersoldier as he held hands with his spouse. The young woman, dressedup in a skirt and blouse, had sprinted the last few yards toembrace her husband.   In addition to the 10,000 troops crossing at Moc Bai, Vietnamsoldiers crossed over at port towns on the Mekong River and atseveral other locations overland. In all, Vietnam said its last26,000 troops were coming home today.   Logistics and artillery divisions, along with wounded soldiers,crossed the border at Samat, several miles north of Moc Bai. Tanksand armored personnel carriers arrived at the port town of Rach Gai.   Outside of Moc Bai, villagers crowded around the trucks to cheerthe soldiers. Many waved Vietnamese flags. Some threw flowers tothe troops.   ``Welcome home!,'' many people shouted.   But many soldiers said they were worried about their future.Vietnam has said it will demobilize many after the withdrawal, andunemployment is high.   For the past decade, tens of thousands of Vietnamese troops havebeen in Cambodia helping the Phnom Penh government battle acoalition of guerrilla groups whose strongest faction is the KhmerRouge.   Both the Hanoi and Pnom Penh governments hope the withdrawalwill convince countries to end economic and diplomatic boycottsimposed after Vietnam's invasion.   Phnom Penh's Premier Hun Sen says he also hopes the pullout willpersuade China and Thailand to stop aiding the three guerrillagroups.   ``After the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops the war willcontinue,'' Hun Sen told reporters Sunday. ``As to the scope of thewar, we think it will depend on foreign countries,'' he said.   The guerrillas have called the troop withdrawal a sham, and saythousands of Vietnamese troops will remain, disguised as Cambodians.   At a series of farewell ceremonies over the past six days in keyprovincial towns, Cambodians cheered the departing troops andpraised the communist solidarity between the two neighboringcountries.   Some Cambodians said they welcomed the withdrawal, while otherssaid they feared the Khmer Rouge, which has been on the offensiveas the Vietnamese withdraw.   On Monday, in a report received today in Bangkok, Khmer Rougeradio claimed its forces had captured two more positions in thewest, at Peam Ta and Toek Sok. The guerrillas also claim to havecaptured ``a major strategic position'' on the road between the keytowns of Battambang and Pailin in western Cambodia.   Pailin is the center of a remote ruby mining district nearThailand, where the guerrilla groups are based.   Western diplomats do not normally consider Khmer Rouge radioreports reliable sources of information.   Phnom Penh's defense minister, Gen. Tea Banh, has acknowledgedthe guerrillas have seized teritory near Pailin, but said the arearemained under government control.   Cambodian officials have repeatedly assured reporters that theyare capable of fighting the guerrillas without Vietnamese militarysupport, but concede that some Phnom Penh residents have begunstocking rice and other staples in anticipation of a cut-off ofsupplies to the capital.   In 1975, Khmer Rouge forces encircled the city, forcing thewithdrawal of U.S. Embassy personnel on April 12 and the fall ofthe U.S-backed Lon Nol government five days later.   In the decade since Vietnam's invasion, the number of KhmerRouge troops has fallen from 170,000 to 17,000, Vietnamese armyofficials say.</TEXT></DOC>
