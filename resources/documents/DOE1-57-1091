<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-57-1091 </DOCNO><TEXT>Activities of iron-based materials for the simultaneous total oxidationof CO and C{sub 3}H{sub 6} were measured under conditions that were typicalof automotive operation: space velocity of 35,000 h{sup -1}; temperaturesbetween 373 and 873 K; atmospheric pressure; feed composition of 2.5%CO, 1.7% O{sub 2}, 0.5% H{sub 2}, 0.05% C{sub 3}H{sub 6}, and, optionally,0.004% SO{sub 2} in He. In the absence of SO{sub 2}, activity decreasedin the order Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3}/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} andgt; Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3}/TiO{sub2} {similar_to} Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3} andgt;andgt; FeSbO{sub 4} andgt; FePO{sub 4} andgt; Fe{sub2}(MoO{sub 4}){sub 3}. CO and C{sub 3}H{sub 6} removal followed apparentfirst-order kinetics and the data showed a compensation law effect. Oxidationwas inhibited when SO{sub 2} was present; temperatures for CO conversionover Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3} were raised about 160 K, while the comparablerise for C{sub 3}H{sub 6} oxidation was about 80 K. Inhibition was lesswith Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3} on 35 m{sup 2}/g TiO{sub 2} than with Fe{sub 2}O{sub3} on 350 m{sup 2}/g Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} or with unsupported 5 m{sup 2}/gFe{sub 2}O{sub 3}. Both FeSbO{sub 4} and FePO{sub 4} showed good activityfor the conversion of C{sub 3}H{sub 6}, but not of CO, when SO{sub 2}was absent. Material balances indicate that the partial oxidation productacrolein inhibits CO oxidation over these binary selective oxidationcatalysts. Collectively, the data suggest that an inhibitor is createdby oxidation of a precursor and its oxidation can be inhibited by theproduct of another feed component through control of the size of reactiveensembles on the catalyst surface.</TEXT></DOC>
