The expression of specific receptorsfor peptide hormones in such a translation system would facilitate studieson the structure and regulation of cell-surface receptors as well astheir coupling to membrane transduction mechanisms. The expression ofreceptors for calcium-mobilizing hormones in Xenopus oocytes was soughtby analysis of phospholipid turnover in hormone-stimulated oocytes. Forthis purpose, Xenopus oocytes were injected with mRNA extracted frombovine adrenal and pituitary glands and incubated with myo-[{sup 3}H]inositolto label plasma-membrane phosphatidylinositol phosphates. The expressionof functionally active receptors for angiotensin II (AII) and thyrotropin-releasinghormone (TRH) was demonstrated by the stimulation of [{sup 3}H]inositolphosphate production by AII and TRH in the mRNA-injected, [{sup 3}H]inositol-prelabeledoocytes. The ability of AII and TRH to act by way of newly synthesizedreceptors from mammalian endocrine tissues to stimulate phosphatidylinositolpolyphosphate hydrolysis in Xenopus oocytes suggests a generalized andconserved mechanism of receptor coupling to the transduction mechanismresponsible for activation of phospholipase C in the plasma membrane.</TEXT></DOC>
