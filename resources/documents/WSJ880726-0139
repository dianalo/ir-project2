Supported by this reasoning, bonus plans are becoming one of the most popular new ideas in ad agency compensation. Such companies as General Foods Corp., RJR Nabisco Inc. and Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. now give their agencies bonuses of as much as 20% for what they consider outstanding work, and many others are considering similar plans.    However, there is little consensus about how best to gauge the quality of advertising. A century ago, the retailer John Wanamaker is said to have complained, &quot;Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted, and the trouble is, I don't know which half.&quot; Although advertising specialists have since come up with various quantitative and qualitative models in an attempt to find an answer, they don't seem much closer than Mr. Wanamaker.    Some critics, moreover, say bonus programs aren't really about promoting good advertising. Patrick J. McGrath, president of the New York-based ad agency Jordan, McGrath, Case andamp; Taylor, argues that the plans have more to do with corporate politics and the current obsession with costs. Ad managers, he says, can make their bosses feel better if they can &quot;demonstrate they're controlling the costs of advertising by building incentives up and down.&quot;    While bonus-paying companies insist that better advertising is their main goal, they do concede that costs are also a major factor. Traditionally, companies have paid their agencies 15% of the total amount spent on a campaign. But media costs have soared in recent years, making more advertisers unhappy with this setup. Besides bonus plans, some have been negotiating lower percentages or flat fees.    Only a handful of companies are willing to discuss their bonus plans, but ad agencies say dozens more have put such programs in place. Under a bonus system, a client typically agrees to pay either a flat fee or a smaller base commission -- usually 10% to 14% -- and then make further payments for superior work. Because the purpose of advertising is to encourage consumer buying, some companies look primarily at the sales performance of specific brands or of the company overall. Others focus on more subjective factors, such as response surveys and the assessments of in-house marketing staffs.    Since last year, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., an RJR Nabisco subsidiary, has awarded letter grades in evaluating agency work on a brand-by-brand basis. In the 1987 ratings, ads for five of 11 cigarette brands received A's, earning the agencies responsible an additional 20% of the base commission. (B's get a 10% bonus; C's and D's get straight commission, which the company won't disclose but says hasn't been cut under the plan.)    Reynolds emphasizes &quot;creative development and execution,&quot; which account for 55% of an agency's grade. The category combines judgment calls by the Reynolds marketing staff with a wide range of information gleaned from test audiences. The rest of the grade is based on &quot;marketing counsel and ideas&quot; (20%), &quot;promotion support&quot; (15%) and &quot;cost controls&quot; (10%).    Sales figures aren't used at all in the assessment, says John T. Winebrenner, senior vice president of marketing. For instance, the Salem cigarette brand, which began a new ad campaign in mid-1987, didn't show gains in either market share or sales, yet the campaign won a top rating. Mr. Winebrenner says research into audience response showed positive results likely to translate into sales later on.    &quot;In our business, there's a very high rate of loyalty that makes it much more difficult to sway smokers,&quot; he explains. &quot;It may take years in the case of some brands&quot; to see advertising's effects. No agency, he adds, should be &quot;punished&quot; for that lag.    At General Foods, however, sales figures play a large role in the bonus plan, which also assigns letter grades on a brand-by-brand basis. &quot;Advertising that works changes behavior, and it's the behavior we're paying for,&quot; says David Hurwitt, vice president of marketing services at the Philip Morris Cos. subsidiary.    Thus, Mr. Hurwitt notes, a brand that begins a new campaign in October and gets terrific audience response may still earn only a B if sales data don't show sufficient results by January. &quot;That's what a B is,&quot; he says. &quot;We think it's good, it checks out, but it hasn't had a chance to prove itself yet with business results.&quot; If the same brand's advertising does well in qualitative testing the next year but still doesn't surpass sales goals set by managers, the B grade remains.    On the General Foods scale, an A wins three percentage points above base commission; B's and C's get base commission only, which will be about 13% when the plan takes effect next January.    Sears Roebuck's approach focuses on the performance of the company as a whole. Thomas Morris, vice president of marketing at Sears, says company executives set goals for revenue growth. If they are met, the company's ad agency, New York-based Ogilvy andamp; Mather, gets a bonus in addition to its flat annual fee. If further levels are reached, the agency gets more, up to a specified ceiling.    Mr. Morris says that Sears' revenue growth in the past two years hasn't been &quot;as high as we would have liked,&quot; but he declines to say whether bonuses were awarded. He calls Sears and its agency &quot;true partners,&quot; adding, &quot;We either succeed together or we fail together.&quot;    Companies that use bonus systems say they're generally pleased with the results, and most agencies with bonus-paying clients say they're happy with the chance to work for extra profit. But some advertising executives question the use of sales as a measure of ads' effectiveness.    Mr. McGrath of Jordan McGrath notes that product sales often rise or fall for reasons entirely unrelated to advertising. Three years ago, he recalls, sales of Tums antacid tablets, which contain calcium, shot up because of high demand for calcium supplements. Mentions of calcium were subsequently inserted into the ads.    Many ad executives contend, too, that certain bonus programs don't necessarily reward an agency when it does good work. Graham Phillips, chairman of Ogilvy's U.S. operations, says sales-linked incentive systems can be hard to work with, particularly in a mature market such as merchandising, where revenue growth is tough to achieve. &quot;If the agency is doing brilliant work,&quot; he says, &quot;revenue figures can (still) be absolutely flat.&quot;    And some ad executives even dispute the basic premise of bonus plans. Robert Schmidt, president and chief executive of Levine, Huntley, Schmidt andamp; Beaver Inc. in New York, asserts that added percentage points can't change an agency's ability to do good work. &quot;Motivation to do terrific work is inherent in an agency's philosophy,&quot; he says. &quot;It's not (something) that can be negotiated.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
