Telephone officials said the fire that gutted a two-story Illinois Bell Telephone Co. building in suburban Hinsdale, Ill., Sunday night wiped out key elements of the company's fiber-optic system, used to transmit computer messages and other electronic signals.    The incident underscored the vulnerability of fiber-optic telephone hubs to natural disasters. The hubs are highly efficient nerve centers for a wide range of communications operations. Computers rely heavily on fiber-optic telephone lines, which are bunched together in what telephone officials call &quot;gateways,&quot; such as the Hinsdale station. &quot;Hinsdale is the major gateway for everything south and west of Chicago,&quot; said James Eibel, Illinois Bell's operations vice president.    The most critical problem came at O'Hare, the nation's busiest airport, where officials struggled Monday to restore computer links that went dead between the field's control tower and the Federal Aviation Administration center directing incoming aircraft. An FAA official said air traffic controllers, used to transmitting flight data by computer, ended up trying to communicate by phone. &quot;It was like shouting messages across the river,&quot; he said.    FAA officials said there weren't any unusual air-safety problems, but the normal five-mile distance between landing planes was stretched to 20 miles, causing air-traffic backups across the nation Monday. Some 20% of O'Hare's 2,300 daily flights were canceled that day.    Officials at O'Hare said yesterday that conditions had returned to normal. Illinois Bell officials said they were able to reroute nearly 50% of the Hinsdale circuits to other gateways in the Chicago area by late yesterday. The company said users were given priority based on need. It said it expects to have all the computer circuits operating normally by Saturday.    But throughout the early part of this week, the fire gave Chicagoans a taste of life without some of the computerized amenities many have come to rely on. More than 300 cash machines throughout the city and its suburbs stopped functioning. &quot;The machines can still talk to you, but the transaction won't go anyplace without the computer line,&quot; said Steven Cole, president of Cash Station Inc., which operates some 900 cash machines in the Chicago area. Dozens of banks were also unable to cash checks because their computer connection to central check-clearing stations was cut.    Pocket beepers fell silent, car telephones went dead and callers from across the U.S. vainly tried to connect with United Airlines' computerized reservation system.    Allegis Corp., United's parent, reported that some 7,000 calls went unanswered because the airline's computers receive calls through Hinsdale. &quot;We know some travel agents in the area who are running outside to call in reservations on their car telephones because their computers don't work,&quot; a United spokesman said.    But telephone officials said thousands of car phones weren't operating because their microwave transmissions connect to land-based switch equipment through the burned-out station. &quot;Hinsdale,&quot; said a spokeswoman for Ameritech Mobile Communications Inc., &quot;is our umbilical cord to the world.&quot;    Shoppers trying to order from Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co.'s Oak Brook, Ill.-based catalog sales office were also out of luck Monday. The giant merchandiser's catalog computers go through Hinsdale, officials said. Trans America Distribution Services, a Transamerica Corp. unit that matches West Coast truckers with East Coast produce buyers, ended up doing business from a suburban hotel room when its computers crashed.    Illinois Bell officials said 16 other stations in the Chicago area feed-fiber optic lines through Hinsdale, making it a kind of electronic choke point for their system. But they said Hinsdale was equipped to automatically shift only 25% of its load to other hubs when the fire occurred. The company said it planned to increase its shifting capacity, but hadn't yet because of the cost. &quot;There's no question that as a result of this outage we'll review our plans,&quot; Mr. Eibel said. </TEXT></DOC>
