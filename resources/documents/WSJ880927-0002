Seib (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><TEXT>   Vice President George Bush, asked which weapons system he would be willing to cut or eliminate, given the tight federal budget, told the audience he was &quot;against&quot; the A-6F plane and the Divad anti-aircraft gun. The only problem is, the Navy canceled the plane a year ago, and the Pentagon killed the Divad in 1985.    Gov. Michael Dukakis, lamenting that many Americans can't afford health insurance, told the audience about an out-of-work Houston man who wouldn't let his son play Little League baseball for fear the child would be hurt and run up medical bills. The only problem is, the health-care proposal Mr. Dukakis is promoting doesn't extend benefits to people without jobs.    Sunday night's presidential debate was free of big gaffes, but not of dubious claims and outright distortions that both campaigns will try to cash in on. Mr. Dukakis, for instance, immediately issued a fact sheet charging Mr. Bush made numerous factual goofs. On the Dukakis list is Mr. Bush's assertion that he wants to &quot;finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapons.&quot; But Mr. Bush cast three tie-breaking votes in the Senate in favor of renewing U.S. production of chemical weapons.    Then there were the slips-of-the-tongue, which, in this debate, belonged to Mr. Bush. The vice president now even makes jokes about his propensity to get facts and sentences mixed up when speaking extemporaneously. At one point, he got the names of America's various land-based strategic nuclear missiles mixed up, saying: &quot;We are going to make some changes and some tough choices before we go to deployment on the Midgetman missile or on the Minuteman, whatever it is.&quot;    What he meant to say was that choices would have to be made before deploying both the Midgetman and MX missiles. The Minuteman has been the cornerstone of the U.S. land-based ballistic-missile system since the 1960s. (Mr. Bush caught his mistake a moment later.)    Though the careful Mr. Dukakis avoided such verbal slip-ups, he played loose with a few facts. At one point, he asserted flatly that the Reagan administration has &quot;cut federal aid to education.&quot;    The reality is more complex. Education spending actually increased 16.5% from 1981 to 1987. But inflation increased 25% during that same period, so Mr. Dukakis could argue that, after adjusting for inflation, spending on education did decline.    Moreover, until last year, the White House consistently proposed deeper cuts in education spending than Congress enacted. Still, Mr. Bush was quick to reply: &quot;The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government.&quot;    Mr. Bush, meanwhile, asserted there was &quot;no evidence . . . no hard evidence&quot; that Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega was involved in drug dealings until he was indicted in February. But, as Mr. Bush himself has noted, rumors and suggestions that Mr. Noriega had drug links were circulating for several years before the indictment. In the past, Mr. Bush has only claimed the links weren't substantiated until the indictment.    Mr. Bush also contended that &quot;seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega&quot; -- in other words, presidents all the way back to Dwight Eisenhower. Intelligence sources say Mr. Noriega first went on the Central Intelligence Agency payroll under President Nixon; he joined the Panamanian National Guard, the source of his current power, in 1964, three years after President Eisenhower left office.    But James Baker, Bush's campaign chairman, asserted Monday that Noriega had a &quot;connection&quot; to the Panamanian military during the Eisenhower administration -- and implied that the connection extended to the U.S. government. Mr. Noriega attended the Peruvian Military Academy from 1956 to 1961 -- Mr. Eisenhower's second term -- and, according to his biography, would have been 22 years old when Mr. Eisenhower retired. During Mr. Eisenhower's first term, Mr. Noriega was in high school. Intelligence sources say the CIA did use Panamanian students to spy on other students suspected of communist activities in the 1950s.    During the debate, the vice president also said Mr. Dukakis &quot;raised taxes five different times&quot; while governor of Massachusetts. But a fact sheet distributed by Mr. Bush's own campaign lists just four tax increases Mr. Dukakis has proposed since 1975 -- and notes that two of those were never enacted.    The Dukakis campaign, meanwhile, has begun hitting away at Mr. Bush's defense of deposed Philippine leader Ferdinand Marcos as someone who fought Japanese imperialism in World War II. Mr. Bush made the comment while trying to explain why, early in the Reagan term, he characterized the Philippine strongman as a defender of democracy.    Mr. Bush, who flew a combat mission over Manila in World War II, said that Mr. Marcos at the time &quot;was down there fighting against imperialism.&quot; But few besides Mr. Marcos himself support such a claim. Recent reports indicate that Mr. Marcos exaggerated his war role and battle feats. Indeed, the U.S. military turned down his appeals for battle decorations after investigating his war record.    Finally, there is the matter of the nuclear freeze. Mr. Dukakis may have been misleading in suggesting during the debate that Mr. Bush once was &quot;more sympathetic&quot; to the nuclear-freeze movement. In reality, Mr. Bush appealed several years ago for a less-partisan debate over nuclear-weapons policy, but he didn't speak favorably of the freeze concept. The Reagan administration has fought the concept, and the vice president has criticized Mr. Dukakis for backing it. </TEXT></DOC>
