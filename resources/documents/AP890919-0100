Quayle praised South Korea's recent democratic reforms but askedKang why political violence continued, a South Korean official said.   Kang replied that it was because the Korean people still havelittle experience with democracy and tend to shun compromise andstick to a ``logic of choosing between black and white,'' the sourcesaid.   The official, who demanded anonymity, said Quayle and Kangdiscussed a wide range of issues, including the future of the 43,000U.S. troops in South Korea. David Beckwith, Quayle's spokesman, saidthey discussed subjects ranging from President Roh Tae-woo's visitto Washington Oct. 26 to East-West relations.   ``The meeting was productive, and I am looking forward to meetingand learning about the Korean people,'' Quayle told reporters.Neither he nor Kang would describe what they discussed.   During the 45-minute meeting, hundreds of radical students heldanti-government, anti-U.S. rallies on at least five collegecampuses. The students represent a small minority that has failed towin widespread support.   Hundreds of riot police ringed the schools, but there were noreports of arrests or injuries.   At Kyunghee University in eastern Seoul, 50 students burned aU.S. flag and an effigy of Quayle. They also shouted slogans callingthe new U.S. ambassador, Donald Gregg, a ``CIA master of politicalmanipulation.''   Protests were also reported at three other campuses in Seoul,including Seoul Municipal Polytech University, where 100 studentsburned a U.S. flag and chanted, ``We oppose Quayle's visit to thedeath.''   In the southern provincial city of Kwangju, 500 radical studentsshouted ``Yankee go home!'' and battled police with firebombs androcks, police said.   The protests were small by South Korean standards, and dissidentgroups made no effort to organize street demonstrations againstQuayle's visit.   The radicals are demanding an end to close ties with Washingtonand expulsion of the U.S. troops based in South Korea.   Quayle is on the first stop of an Asian trip that also will takehim to Japan, the Philippines and Malaysia. He meets on Wednesdaywith Roh and heads of the main opposition political parties, whichoften clash with Roh.   South Korean opposition leaders planned to tell Quayle abouttheir concerns over deteriorating human rights, opposition partyofficials said. A National Assembly report released Sunday said2,094 people had been detained on political charges since Roh cameto power in February 1988.   U.S. officials, who demanded anonymity, said Quayle would urgethe Roh government to show greater respect for human rights in viewof the jailings and other government moves to curb opposition.   Roh has introduced broad democratic reforms since he took office,but opposition groups claim that the reforms made so far are notenough.   U.S. officials have expressed concern about the recent indictmentof top South Korean opposition leader Kim Dae-jung on chargesconnected with an opposition lawmaker's secret trip to CommunistNorth Korea last year.   Under South Korean law, failure to report visits to North Koreacan be punished by a five-year prison term. The two Koreas arebitter enemies.</TEXT></DOC>
