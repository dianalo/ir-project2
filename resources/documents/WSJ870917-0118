Simply in the course of deciding cases, they get to express their views on a wide range of issues -- in our time, a remarkably wide range of issues -- that come before the court. When a chief justice of the Supreme Court writes a book on the side, the public may expect that he has a special ax to grind.    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist does not -- not at least in &quot;The Supreme Court: How It Was, How It Is&quot; (Morrow, 338 pages, $18.95). There are no fierce attacks, no impassioned pleas. Nor does the book offer inside gossip about factional struggles on today's much-divided court. In what he describes as a book for the &quot;interested, informed nonlawyer,&quot; the chief justice also avoids the sort of grand theorizing about constitutional principles that might suggest a sharp contrast between his own views and those of his colleagues.    Part memoir of his early days as a law clerk, part rumination on the earlier history of the Supreme Court, this book is of most interest for what it reveals about the personal temperament and general outlook of our current chief justice. And most readers who come to the book with that interest may find it rather reassuring. Chief Justice Rehnquist comes across as a judge more governed by caution than passionate conviction.    In his first encounters with the Supreme Court, as a law clerk to Justice Robert H. Jackson in the early 1950s, Mr. Rehnquist's dominant reaction, as he tells it, was one of awe. Fresh out of Stanford Law School, which &quot;at that time did not enjoy as much national prestige as it does today,&quot; Mr. Rehnquist was astonished that Justice Jackson had ever decided to take him on as a clerk.    His recollections in this part of the book try to give the reader a sense of how the court works by describing its handling of the Steel Seizure case, the most controversial ruling of Mr. Rehnquist's clerkship. In this decision, the Supreme Court ordered President Truman to lift unauthorized controls on the steel industry. Looking back on the case, Mr. Rehnquist concludes that judges cannot escape being influenced by &quot;the great tides of public opinion that run in a country such as ours . . . and I think that such influence played an appreciable part in causing the Steel Seizure case to be decided the way it was.&quot; And this analysis is not put forward as criticism.    The figure from the court of that era who comes across most vividly in Mr. Rehnquist's recollections is not Justice Jackson, however, but Felix Frankfurter, the brilliant New Dealer who continued to be the court's most determined advocate of restraint during the Warren Court years. Justice Frankfurter and the young Mr. Rehnquist developed a sufficiently warm relationship that Mr. Frankfurter was invited to Mr. Rehnquist's wedding -- along with Mr. Frankfurter's own clerk at the time, Alexander Bickel (who later became a distinguished critic of the Warren Court in his own right, as a professor at the Yale Law School, where he is said to have exerted great influence on his colleague Robert Bork). It was Justice Frankfurter, it turns out, who first urged young Mr. Rehnquist to enter Republican politics, &quot;saying that conservatives as well as liberals ought to get active on the political scene.&quot;    The middle chapters of the book, offering a personal overview of the court's history until 1953, are filled with admiring sketches of the most influential justices of the past. But the narrative tends to focus more on the court's disastrous excesses than its triumphs. Mr. Rehnquist devotes almost an entire chapter to the Dred Scott case -- the court's 1858 pro-slavery ruling that helped trigger the Civil War. Another chapter describes the confrontation between President Roosevelt and the laissez-faire majority of the court in the mid-1930s -- with few hints of sympathy for the judicial conservatives of that era.    In the final chapters of the book, the chief justice sketches some of the basic operating procedures of the contemporary court and in the course of this presentation offers a few more hints about his view of his responsibilities as a judge. In describing, for example, the flaws in different lawyers' styles of oral argument before the court, Mr. Rehnquist complains about the &quot;spellbinder&quot; whose &quot;magniloquent presentation of the big picture&quot; cannot compensate for his lack of &quot;any careful analysis of the legal issues in the case&quot; at hand. And he praises the late Justice Potter Stewart as &quot;the quintessential judge&quot; for being the colleague &quot;least influenced by considerations extraneous to the strictly legal aspects of a case.&quot;    Still, Mr. Rehnquist never pretends that the court's role can ever be entirely reduced to a search for precedents. Earlier in the book, for example, he offers warm praise for post-Civil War Justice Samuel Miller, who, in &quot;an era when the weight of already decided cases had a good deal more authority than it does now,&quot; still &quot;never hesitated&quot; to &quot;call a halt&quot; to technical arguments and say: &quot;Your argument is perfectly logical but the result for which you contend seems to me absurd.&quot;    The Supreme Court, Mr. Rehnquist acknowledges, can be equally &quot;beset by temptations to be too timid on the one hand or too bold on the other.&quot; As an example of judicial timidity, Mr. Rehnquist cites the court's &quot;extraordinarily insensitive&quot; endorsement of racial segregation in the late 19th century. But on the whole, this volume conveys the temper of a justice who would rather err on the side of caution.    ---   Mr. Rabkin is an assistant professor of government at Cornell University. </TEXT></DOC>
