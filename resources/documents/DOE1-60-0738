<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-60-0738 </DOCNO><TEXT>The CUP1 gene of the yeast S. cerevisiae encodes a low molecular-weight,cysteine-rich copper-binding protein denoted copper-metallothionein (MT).The biosynthesis of copper-MT is transcriptionally induced by the additionof copper to the growth medium. Promoter deletion analyses have delineateda critical region, composed of two upstream activation sequences (UASs),required for copper - induced transcription. These cis - acting sequencespresumably operate through a positive activation mechanism, since a syntheticversion of one of the UAS elements is capable of activating a heterologousyeast promoter in a copper - dependent fashion. A mutant strain has beenisolated which fails to efficiently induce the CUP1 promoter. This recessive,trans-acting mutation may lie in a genetic locus which affects the productionor activity of cellular factors responsible for copper-induced transcriptionof CUP1.</TEXT></DOC>
