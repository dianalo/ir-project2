The titleof this application is ``Development of Methods for Controlling PrematureOxygen Breakthrough During Fireflooding''. Scope: The intended financial assistance is intended to support a programfor developing methods of preventing or controlling premature oxygen breakthroughduring fireflooding. The overall objective is to characterize the reservoirmechanisms that cause premature oxygen breakthrough and develop practicaltools for controlling it. The focus will be on those conditions most likelyto be encountered in moderate depth to deep reservoirs. The proposed programencompasses the liaison and analyses necessary to characterize the primarymechanisms associated with premature oxygen breakthrough, simulation testsdesigned to replicate specific reservoir heterogeneities, and evaluatemitigating measures, and computer modeling to reproduce the test resultsand provide the scale-up necessary to predict performance of mitigationtechniques in actual field operations. This proposal addresses a basic problem with in-situ combustion and otherprocesses that require the injection of gases or liquids which is thatsweep efficiency is often lowered by phenomena such as gravity separation,viscous fingering, and reservoir heterogeneity. Reservoir conditions suchas high permeability streaks, fractures, and lens allow the injection gasto bypass the combustion front and prematurely break through to the productionwells. This premature breakthrough lowers the production rate and increasesoperating costs as well as posing safety problems. This proposal is for a three-year period at a total estimated value of$1,066,770 of which the DOE share is $522,720.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> U.S. Department of Energy, PittsburghEnergy Technology Center, P.O.
