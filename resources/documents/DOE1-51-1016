Means of reductionare used to obtain the iron II compound within the washing solution,in order to reduce iron oxidised by the oxygen of the combustion wastegases from iron II to iron III in the chelate complex and therefore tominimise the use of expensive means of reduction. In order to be ableto carry out simultaneous removal of SO/sub 2//NO/sub x/ with the simultaneousproduction of gas enriched in SO/sub 2/ in a cheap way with low consumptionof means of reductions and operating material, the invention proposesthat to obtain gas enriched in SO/sub 2/, a desorber and a second desorbershould be fitted after the simultaneous SO/sub 2//NO/sub x/ washer, wherethe second desorber is operated with a part of the clean gas after thewasher and additional sulphuric acid as carrier gas. The reduction ofFe III with gas enriched in SO/sub 2/ also takes place and in order tocover any deficit in SO/sub 2/, the deficit of SO/sub 2/ is producedby cracking of the gypsum produced or of gypsum from a melting chamberor a cracking furnace.</TEXT></DOC>
