One man apparently froze to death on aNew York street, and a Baltimore woman warming her heatless homewith candles died in a fire.   Accidents on snowy roads were blamed for at least 10 deaths inthe Midwest.   More than a foot of snow was responsible for hundreds of weekendtraffic accidents in Ohio, authorities said.

Snow was forecast for Wisconsin, a snow advisory was ineffect for eastern Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, and wintryweather was possible in the Carolinas beginning tonight.   The cold air mass was so far-reaching that it producedpredictions of snow over Mississippi today, the National WeatherService said.   The bitter temperatures forced hundreds of homeless off thestreets in Detroit and into shelters, agencies reported.   ``We've filled every bed we have. It usually gets worse when theweather gets colder _ people who normally might not come here showup because they just can't bear the cold,'' said Edith Richardson,assistant supervisor of the 113-bed Detroit Rescue Mission.   In New York City, police took only four homeless people toshelters overnight. Three came in voluntarily, and a cold weatheralert gave police the authority to remove the fourth from thestreets against her will, said a department spokesman, Sgt. MauriceHoward.   One homeless New York man didn't make it to a shelter. The manwas found Sunday on a Brooklyn street, apparently frozen to death,police said. The man's identity was not known.   The temperature in New York City's Central Park hit 5 degreesearly today, breaking the previous record for the date of 9 degrees,set in 1960.   Thermometers also hit record lows in numerous cities across themiddle and northern Atlantic Coast states.

The women's shelter at the Pine Street Inn in Boston was filledovernight with 50 women, and the men's shelter had between 350 and400 men.   ``We can feel it,'' said shelter employee Anita Dzirne. A vanoperated by the shelter to bring in street people ``brought in quitea few. They're very busy tonight.''   The cold was a factor in scattered power outages that affected atleast 2,900 customers in Connecticut, said Jeffrey R. Kotkin, aNortheast Utilities spokesman.
