Chipello (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> WNEWS </CO><IN> STK SCR </IN><TEXT>   A couple of years ago, Charles Howard III was sitting atop a little corner of the securities world. The 43-year-old stock broker was the kingpin of New England thrift stocks and one of the leading commission-producers for his New York-based securities house. He threw lavish parties attended by scores of bankers.    Now, he's out of a job.    Mr. Howard, who figures in a yearlong investigation by federal and state securities authorities, was fired Tuesday by Thomson McKinnon Securities, his employer of the past 15 years. He hasn't been charged with any crime.    A spokeswoman for the firm said Mr. Howard was dismissed because of the company's dissatisfaction &quot;with his cooperation in the firm's internal investigation&quot; into possible stock-trading irregularities, among other things, and &quot;dissatisfaction with his compliance with the firm's policies and directives.&quot;    Calls to Mr. Howard's Bedford, N.H., home went unanswered yesterday afternoon, and a call to his attorney in Boston wasn't returned. The Thomson McKinnon spokeswoman, Kaye Ramsden, said Mr. Howard, in his discussions with the firm, has continued to disavow any wrongdoing.    Ms. Ramsden also noted that Thomson McKinnon's &quot;internal investigation to date hasn't indicated any unlawful conduct by the firm.&quot;    Mr. Howard made his name mainly as a financial adviser to small New England savings banks, many of which converted from mutual to public ownership in the mid-1980s. During much of the bull market, New England thrift stocks were star performers, and Mr. Howard was their most visible -- and flamboyant -- advocate.    Mr. Howard not only helped the fledgling public companies drum up interest in their shares, he helped invest the capital they raised in the public offerings. In many cases, the banks he advised invested large amounts in each other. And they lent funds to other clients of Mr. Howard, who sometimes invested in the same stocks.    As the market grew, so did Mr. Howard's reputation as a high roller. He collected fancy cars, fine wines and attractive real estate.    But things began to sour about a year ago, as federal and state investigators poked into irregular trading in New England bank stocks, particularly involving a merger between Suffield, Conn.-based Suffield Financial Corp. and Portland, Maine-based Coastal Bancorp. Mr. Howard was an adviser to Robert DiGennaro, the former Suffield chairman who was convicted in federal court in Hartford, Conn., earlier this month on a charge of insider trading stemming from trading before the 1986 merger announcement.    A jury found that Mr. DiGennaro had tipped off associates to the impending merger, and shared in some of the resulting trading profits. Two of the associates pleaded guilty to insider trading, and a Hartford-based broker for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud for passing the inside information to others.    Other bankers who once worked closely with Mr. Howard were embarrassed by losses in their institutions' investment portfolios, after a spike in interest rates in early 1987 hurt thrift stocks. William S. Bushnell, former chairman and chief executive officer of Manchester, N.H.-based Amoskeag Bank Shares, resigned those posts in March after admitting that he had given Mr. Howard too much leeway with the bank's investments.    Meanwhile, state regulators in Connecticut and Vermont circulated notices to Mr. Howard's clients saying that he had failed to register as a broker in those states. The regulators advised the clients that they might be able to cancel the transactions and recoup any losses, and several subsequently filed court cases seeking to do so. (Thomson McKinnon has disputed the claims, contending that properly registered brokers in its Bedford, N.H., office handled the trades.)    The spokeswoman for Thomson McKinnon said yesterday that the firm &quot;will continue to cooperate with any investigation by state and federal authorities.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
