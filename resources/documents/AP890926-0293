The changes were detailed Monday by Miguel Rodriguez Fandeo,Venezuela's minister of planning, The New York Times reported inits Tuesday editions.   Rodriguez said an agreement was near on a $600 million interimloan from the banks. The loan would enable the South Americannation to meet some interest payments missed over the last severalmonths ``in order to create the atmosphere so the negotiatingprocess could speed up.''   Rodriguez, interviewed in Washington at the annual meetings ofthe World Bank and International Monetary Fund, said the changeswere made to ``accommodate the realities of the banks.'' He wasreferring to the different legal and accounting rules in differingcountries.   He added that Venezuela had not changed its position in responseto moves in the last few weeks by three major U.S. banks toincrease their reserves for bad Third World loans. The moves by thebanks were seen as making it more difficult for Third World debtorsto restructure their debts.   Instead of its 50 percent reduction in its $21 billion in loansfrom commercial banks, a goal the banks rejected, Venezuela willnow offer the banks a broad range of options on debt reduction,Rodriguez said.   The options would include reducing the debt by various levels,starting at 60 percent and going to below the 35 percent levelnegotiated in a debt agreement with Mexico. Banks also would havethe option of making new loans, he said.   Offering various debt reduction levels to different banks wouldmake it easier to negotiate than trying to reach agreement on onenumber among all banks, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
