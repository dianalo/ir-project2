In his words, &quot;always an onlooker, never a player.&quot;    A Catholic reared in a Calvinist world; a lover of Latin poetry schooled among boys fearful that reading books would grow hair on their hands; a liberal from South Africa's Afrikanerdom, Mr. Hope, who lives in exile here, says: &quot;I began to feel homesick before I left home.&quot;    In three darkly comic novels (&quot;A Separate Development,&quot; &quot;Kruger's Alp&quot; and &quot;The Hottentot Room&quot;) Mr. Hope ridiculed the elaborate, white-built, racially based systems of his homeland.    Now, he has returned from a 1987 trip home with &quot;White Boy Running&quot; (published this month), part memoir, part pessimistic report on a society heading for a cliff.    He was four years old in 1948 when apartheid's founders hijacked South Africa into its special world of racism. That world was built in stages, law by law, growing more cruel every year. Mr. Hope uses the example of detention without trial. In 1963, there was the Ninety Day Detention Act. Two years later, the limit was raised to 180 days. &quot;In 1967 time limits were dropped and although people stopped counting the days, it was still possible to keep a tally of those detained. In 1982 this sad arithmetic went out the window and people stopped counting altogether as unrecorded numbers of people simply disappeared for unknown periods of time,&quot; he writes.    Mr. Hope chose exile in 1974, but exiles, like his characters in &quot;The Hottentot Room,&quot; can be obsessed by the home they left behind. In the Earl's Court district of London, white and black South Africans used to flock to drab bars with names like &quot;The Zanzibar&quot; and &quot;The Zambesi Club,&quot; he remembers. &quot;We had to come abroad to meet our neighbors and discover how patriotic we were,&quot; Mr. Hope says wryly. &quot;Of course, what was remarkable, as far as whites went at least, was that we hadn't tried this exploration of common humanity while at home.&quot;    &quot;I am tremendously bound to South Africa,&quot; Mr. Hope says during a conversation in his north London apartment, but he fears that the country he loves is disappearing. South African exiles, black and white, Mr. Hope says, may end up remembering a land that no longer exists except in their memories.    Memory can be a weapon, he knows. &quot;White Boy Running&quot; aims to remind us that South Africa wasn't always run by apartheid's inhuman rules. &quot;Does the Afrikaner want to be remembered only as an anachronism of history? Known only for 'Whites Only' signs on buses and lavatories?&quot; he wonders.    The book opens with a visit to Balfour, the small-time Transvaal town about an hour from Johannesburg where Mr. Hope's grandfather ran a hotel and became a community pillar, serving several terms as mayor. Whatever prosperity Balfour promised in his grandfather's time ran out years ago. The neighborhood around his grandfather's hotel is designated an Indian residential area now. Whites have moved across the railroad tracks. The Indians complain that the white authorities won't maintain their cricket ground. In the bar of the only white hotel, the Afrikaner clientele worries that the government has gone soft on nonwhites. Loyalties are swinging to apartheid's staunchest defenders, the parties of the South African far right. After a drink or two, a man will talk about taking to the bush with his rifle and his horse to make a last stand defending white South Africa from any giveaway to blacks. &quot;We're the future,&quot; one of these Balfour men says.    They are a sour, belligerent lot. &quot;One of the many paradoxes of South Africa,&quot; Mr. Hope says, &quot;is that the people who suffer most under apartheid seem far less oppressed by it than those who have oppressed them. They retain a brightness of spirit.&quot;    On the other hand, he finds white moderates stale and irrelevant. His return home came during the 1987 whites-only election campaign and he describes attending one of the rallies of a leading moderate, Helen Suzman, the longest-sitting member of Parliament, where he detects fear of failure. &quot;The star of white, moderate, liberal opposition must have exploded many light-years ago and yet the news is only now filtering through,&quot; he writes of the election that saw the moderate white party replaced by the far right as the major parliamentary opposition to the government.    Mr. Hope's contact with the fervent white nationalism of Afrikaners has left him prizing individual rights and despising those who advocate the primacy of any group. Nationalism is prominent in his lexicon of dangerous words. He fears that for all the nonracial rhetoric of the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid movements they may evolve into only a competing nationalism, a mirror image of the Afrikaners. &quot;I have trouble with militant party lines,&quot; he says.    He fears South Africans may have gone too far already to make a nonracial society possible. &quot;The divisions have been made so deep,&quot; he says.    &quot;Until those increasing numbers who have nothing are given a little more, there can be no peace,&quot; he adds, but makes clear he isn't hopeful that the whites will start giving.    Near the end of his memoir, Mr. Hope illustrates why he worries how comfortably he and his books will fit into post-apartheid South Africa. He gives a reading in Soweto, an evening as pleasant but also as alarming as any experience of his visit home. His audience first convicts him of an incorrect attitude toward South Africa because of a poem that satirizes a racist white man, but finally gives him a suspended sentence. &quot;I get the point,&quot; Mr. Hope writes. &quot;This is the front line and it will not do to read to front-line troops subtle analyses of the psychological perversions of the enemy.&quot;    It suits Mr. Hope to abandon neither his liking for subtlety nor history. &quot;It's when they start to rename the streets that one has to worry,&quot; he says of a century in which the world has repainted legions of street signs. &quot;The Afrikaners changed names in the 1940s, of course. Apartheid's successors will, no doubt, rename them again.&quot;    Almost as if his pessimistic recital has so suffused the room with gloom that a few brighter words on the prospects for a harmonious nonracial South Africa are needed to clear the air, he says: &quot;One lives in hope. I'm rightly named.&quot;    ---   Mr. Lescaze is deputy foreign editor of the Journal. </TEXT></DOC>
