Even government officials grudgingly admit the insurgents willprobably be bolstered by the surprise proposal made Tuesday.   One high-ranking Cabinet official likened the guerrillas' offerto a bomb and complimented the rebels on devising such a powerfulweapon.   ``It is very ably constructed. You have to take it apart verycarefully and examine all the component parts in trying todeactivate it,'' he said of the rebels' radical policy shift.   The Cabinet official spoke on condition of anonymity because thegovernment has not formally responded to the rebel proposal. TheUnited States also has not responded.   Fidel Chavez Mena, the incumbent Christian Democrats'presidential candidate in this year's election, said Tuesday thatthe rebels' main condition for participating in the vote could notbe met.   The guerrillas said elections set for March 19 should bepostponed until September, but the Constitution prohibits such apostponement.   The proposal from the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Frontcan be taken at face value _ or it can be examined for possibleulterior motives.   A nine-year-old civil war has devastated this Massachusetts-sizednation, killing 65,000 of its people, making refugees of a millionand ruining the economy.   The guerrillas, who have called previous elections this decade``farce'' and part of a counterinsurgency plan, may simply want toend the war.   ``The country is headed for a social explosion. We feel aresponsbility to explore possible alternatives. We are beingresponsible and flexible,'' Ana Guadalupe Martinez, a member of theguerrilla General Command, told a news conference Tuesday in MexicoCity.   ``Flexibility is a sign of strength,'' said Salvador Samayoa, amember of the guerrillas' political-diplomatic committee.   The rebel document's authors said their offer was partiallymotivated by ``an international situation in which the majority ofwars are being resolved by means of negotiation.''   Negotiations have recently produced agreements to seek an endconflicts in Afghanistan and Angola, among other countries. TheContra insurgency in Nicaragua has also been quieted by apreliminary cease-fire agreement.   A rebel source in Mexico said: ``There is a wave of negotiationsin the world. We want to look for a solution that is not so drastic(as war) so the country's fall won't be so drastic.''   The guerrillas don't just want to end the war _ they presumablywant to win it. Their proposal, especially if rejected, couldimprove their standing.   Reporters who recently spent time with guerrillas in the hills ofChalatenango and Morazan provinces, both rebel strongholds, heardleaders talk of preparations for a big push in coming weeks.   The insurgents launched two nationwide offensives late last year.During the past three months they have hit four major militaryinstallations in the capital, bringing a predominantly rural war tothe city.   The guerrillas appear heady, and sources close to them confirmedthat attacks will increase if the proposal gets nowhere.   If the rebels do step up their attacks, they likely will point torejection of their election overture as a spurning that left them noalternative but to escalate warfare against an intransigent regime.   Most military observers say the 7,000 rebels have little chanceof defeating the 56,000-man army. The rebels say they are organizingrural and urban sympathizers and that the moment for massinsurrection is not far off.   The rebel proposal appeared to have been directed as much at U.S.politicians as the guerrillas' countrymen.   Copies of the proposal were circulating in Washington on Sunday,24 hours before being leaked to the press in San Salvador.   The two administrations of Ronald Reagan gave more than $3billion in aid to El Salvador with the stated object of fosteringdemocracy. The country has had a civilian president, Jose NapoleonDuarte, since 1984, but leftists claim his administration is afacade for continued military power.   ``We hear they (in the Bush administration) are more practicaland less ideological,'' Samayoa told the Mexico news conference.``We hope for a departure from the policy of the administration ofRonald Reagan, which blocked peace efforts in Central America.''   The rebels enjoy significant support from so-called``solidarity'' groups in the United States that have proveneffective lobbyists in the past.   However their proposal is received, the rebels will not losetheir current supporters. If it is rejected, they could use allegedgovernment inflexibility as a recruitment tool. If it is acceptedwith modifications, they and their political allies could increasetheir base through campaigning.   ``The document was drafted with great skill,'' said thegovernment official. ``If they shot as well as they write, theywould have routed us by now.''</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Doug Mine, former news editor for The AssociatedPress in Buenos Aires, has been based in El Salvador since February1988.</TEXT></DOC>
