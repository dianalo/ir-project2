In an advertisement in some of yesterday's editions ofthis newspaper, Pathe disclosed the names of several banksand European companies that would be advancing money toComfinance S.A., a Luxembourg-based affiliate of Patheprincipal Giancarlo Parretti. Comfinance has agreed toprovide about $368 million toward the purchase price and TimeWarner Inc. has agreed to lend another $650 million. Pathehas already deposited $200 million in cash toward theacquisition.</LP><TEXT>   Pathe said Banque Arabe et Internationale D'Investissementwould provide a $75 million one-week line of credit toComfinance and another $10 million credit line to a Patheaffiliate. The Paris-based bank was created in 1973 with 50%of its shares held by Arab banks and 50% held by non-Arabfinancial institutions. It was one of several banks foundedduring the 1970s to act as a conduit for the recycling ofpetrodollars amassed by the Arab members of the Organizationof Petroleum Exporting Countries. Last month, state-ownedBanque Nationale de Paris said it would take control of thetroubled bank, which had been hobbled by the steep decline inworld crude oil prices during the latter half of the 1980sand bad loans in developing countries.   Another $50 million would come from an advance byAmsterdam-based PAN-ASS B.V. in connection with a proposedsale of certain Spanish assets by Comfinance to an affiliateof PAN-ASS. Other sources of the financing are various assetsales and $15 million under an existing $80 million creditline from Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland B.V., a well-knownentertainment industry lender. Another $91 million would beadvanced to a Pathe affiliate by Deepbridge B.V., Amsterdam.Details about PAN-ASS and Deepbridge weren't available.   Pathe also said it was in discussions with at least threecompanies about acquiring an equity stake in MGM/UA after thetransaction closes, perhaps providing much-needed productionfunds for the new company. They are Rank Laboratories Ltd.,the film-processing unit of British-based Rank OrganisationPLC; RTL-Plus, a Luxembourg-based television company39%-owned by West German media giant Bertelsmann AG, andCinergi Productions Inc., a Beverly Hills, Calif-based filmcompany formed by Andrew G. Vajna, a co-founder of CarolcoPictures Inc. who sold his stake in the company early thisyear for more than $100 million.   The $20-a-share tender offer is scheduled to expireFriday, but could be extended to June 23.
