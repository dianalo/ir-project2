Georgia Power said it may still face civil action from theInternal Revenue Service over its method of accounting foremergency spare parts, and, according to individuals familiarwith the matter, other aspects of a federal grand-juryinvestigation of Southern Co. continue at a brisk pace.</LP><TEXT>   The decision not to prosecute follows a highly publicized,20-month investigation into whether the utility's accountingfor emergency spare parts resulted in its underpaying federalincome taxes of more than $50 million in 1985 and 1986. Theaccounting issue turns on the timing of tax deductions foremergency spare parts: Georgia Power has taken tax deductionswhen it purchased the parts, while the IRS's position is thatsuch parts generally should be expensed, or deducted fromtaxes, only when they are put into use.   Georgia Power's president, A.W. &quot;Bill&quot; Dahlberg, said thecompany had consistently asserted that its method ofaccounting was a valid one and that the matter should behandled civilly, not criminally. Civil charges involve onlythe issue of whether taxes are owed, while criminal chargesalso include the issue of the taxpayer's intent to defraud.   &quot;Twenty months is a long period of time,&quot; Mr. Dahlbergsaid at a news conference. &quot;It has been arduous, it has beendifficult. . . . I guess I'm just pleased that they'vereached this outcome.&quot;   The investigation has placed the company under a cloud,damaged its public image, and hurt employee morale throughoutthe system, which is the largest investor-owned utility inthe nation.   Despite baiting by reporters, Mr. Dahlberg refused tocriticize the government. &quot;I'm proud of the government comingto a good conclusion on this,&quot; he said. However, manyemployees have wondered privately why the U.S. attorney'soffice in Atlanta seemed to handle the investigation withsuch a penchant for publicity.   For example, the grand-jury investigation became public inAugust 1988 when the U.S. Attorney filed an affidavit for asearch warrant for Georgia Power's offices. Then-U.S.attorney Robert L. Barr held a news conference regarding thesearch.   In an interview, Mr. Barr, who is now president of theSoutheast Legal Foundation and who says he has politicalambitions, said Friday that the purpose of the pressconference wasn't to promote publicity on the matter, butrather to dispel rumors. He said he wanted to emphasize thata search wasn't a charge of any wrongdoing &quot;and to keepeverything in perspective.&quot;   The IRS declined to comment.   The spare-parts investigation began in 1988 after GaryGilman, a Georgia Power accountant, went to the IRS and toldagents the company had devised an &quot;off-the-books&quot; scheme todisguise that it was accounting improperly for emergencyspare parts. He became a confidential informant for the IRSand wore a hidden microphone to work, taping conversationswith key Southern Co. and Georgia Power employees about theaccounting method.   The search-warrant affidavit, which lays out thegovernment's justification for a search, alleged that ArthurAndersen andamp; Co., the utility's outside auditor, was also awareof the accounting scheme. In a statement Friday, Robert F.McCullough, managing partner of the Atlanta office of ArthurAndersen, said the firm had maintained all along that theallegations were &quot;preposterous.&quot;   Southern Co. spokesman Gale Klappa said Sunday thatGeorgia Power simply used a personal computer to help it inconverting from one accounting method to another.   Late last year, the U.S. attorney's office in Atlantacompleted its grand-jury probe of spare-parts accounting atSouthern Co. and recommended to the Justice Department inWashington that it be authorized to proceed with a criminaltax-fraud case. Like all criminal tax cases, the matter wasreviewed by the main Justice Department's Criminal TaxDivision to determine whether the department should authorizeor decline a criminal prosecution.   In January, Southern Co.'s outside attorneys, James C.Fleming and two other Atlanta attorneys, met with officialsin the tax division for three days to present theirinterpretation of events and to argue that no criminalstatutes had been broken.   While company officials expressed delight at Friday'sannouncement, their crowing was noticeably muted. Thebeleaguered utility holding company isn't out of the woodsyet. As previously reported, a federal grand-juryinvestigation is continuing to examine, among other things,alleged improprieties involving Southern Co.'s pension fundas well as alleged illegal political contributions.</TEXT></DOC>
