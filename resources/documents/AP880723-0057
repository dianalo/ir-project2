Parliament has been debating the plan to reform the OfficialSecrets Act, which was hastily passed during a Germany spy scare in1911.   The act makes it a criminal offense for the government's 800,000civil servants, diplomats and defense industry employees to revealany official information _ no matter how trivial _ withoutauthorization.   Opposition Labor Party spokesman Roy Hattersley acknowledgedthat the Conservative government's proposal would loosen somerestrictions.   ``But in the areas where open, indeed honest, government istested ... the same illiberal rules apply, some of them withgreater forces and with few safeguards,'' he said during a House ofCommons debate Friday night.   The government's revisions propose to decriminalize trivialleaks, give journalists more legal protection and confine secrecymainly to defense, intelligence and foreign affairs.   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, the Cabinet member responsible forlaw and order, said that except for two provisions in the revision``every other move is in the direction of openness.''   ``No one can seriously weigh these two marginal additionsagainst the immense reductions we propose in the scope of thepresent law and conclude that on balance we are extending thelaw,'' he said.   Hurd said one of the proposals that would toughen the law is theprovision that would make intelligence agents automatically liablefor criminal prosecution for any disclosure.   The other provision would make all information on security,defense and international relations which the government providesin confidence to other countries an automatic official secret.   Hattersley complained that the provision calling for automaticcriminal prosecution of loose-lipped intelligence agents is unfair.He said ``...when they disclose information, the rule is absolute,the criminal sanction is automatic _ no discretion there.''</TEXT></DOC>
