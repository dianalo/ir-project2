Yet economics is a topic that hasnever held much interest for him.   &quot;Economics is not the science that sends men to thebarricades,&quot; he wrote in &quot;Right from the Beginning,&quot; hisautobiography. &quot;The Abraham Lincoln Battalion did not marchinto Franco's guns in the Jarama with the Labor Theory ofValue in mind; and Pickett's division did not charge upCemetery Ridge because they feared the economic consequencesof abolition.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Although a prominent conservative for decades, Mr.Buchanan largely stayed on the sidelines as the supply-siderevolution transformed the economic thinking of theRepublican Party in the late 1970s. He supported the tax cutsadvocated by supply-siders but wasn't deeply involved in themovement, according to those who were. His book even includesa deprecating reference to supply-side economics as the &quot;BigRock Candy Mountain&quot; school of conservatism.   &quot;I think he's against the New Deal,&quot; says Public Interesteditor Irving Kristol, a supply-sider. &quot;That's all I knowabout his views on economics.&quot;   The candidate's thin grounding in economics is illustratedby his campaign proposals, which are sketchy at best. WhilePaul Tsongas's plan to rescue the U.S. economy takes up 85pages, Mr. Buchanan's barely fills three.   He would provide income-tax cuts for the &quot;working andmiddle classes&quot;; abolish the capital-gains tax for peoplemaking less than $50,000 a year and halve it for those makingmore than $50,000; and provide investment tax credits forbusinesses. But he's vague on how big a tax cut for themiddle class he favors, or in what form. &quot;The sorts of thingshe'd be interested in are a tax cut for children, or cuts inthe Social Security payroll tax,&quot; says Terry Jeffrey,research director for the Buchanan campaign.   To pay for all of that, Mr. Buchanan would eliminateforeign aid and &quot;freeze federal spending, hiring, andsalaries.&quot; The broadly stated spending freeze is presentedwith no detail, but Mr. Jeffrey says such a freeze wouldn'taffect Social Security or Medicare -- which are the largestand fastest growing domestic-spending programs in the budget.By leaving them untouched, Mr. Buchanan would virtuallyassure that his large tax cuts would lead to furtherballooning of the federal budget deficit.   While Mr. Buchanan has criticized budget deficits, theydon't appear to rank very high on his list of concerns. In acolumn written in January 1990, he even advocated a tax-cutbidding war as a &quot;win-win proposition for the GOP.&quot;   &quot;Critics claim tax cuts cause deficits,&quot; Mr. Buchananwrote, &quot;but deficits did not harm the party in '84 or '88.And deficits have benefits: First, they converted theDemocrats, rhetorically at least, to the theology of balancedbudgets; second, they killed all enthusiasm for new socialspending.&quot;   For the longer term, Mr. Buchanan's platform offers onlygeneral principles. According to his position paper, he would&quot;reorient and revise the tax code for the long term so thatinvestment and saving is never punished, and idleness andindolence never promoted.&quot; And he would &quot;make the Americanbusiness climate the most conducive in the world totechnological innovation and development.&quot;   He also calls for rolling back congressional pay increasesand limiting congressional terms. And he takes a swipe athigh corporate salaries. As president, the paper says, Mr.Buchanan would &quot;turn over $50,000 of the president's pay tocharity to set an example of leadership for the country.We've had enough of corporate executives making four to fivemillion dollars in pay and bonuses while their workers arebeing put out on the street.&quot;   The part of the Buchanan message that most disturbssupply-siders -- as well as many other economists -- is hisstance against free trade. &quot;Does free trade make for theefficient allocation of resources? Undoubtedly,&quot; Mr. Buchananwrote in June of last year. &quot;But if the efficient allocationof resources means America's unskilled go jobless, whileMexico's unskilled get work, why not come down on the side ofAmerican workers rather than Mexican workers?&quot;   &quot;I think he's a protectionist,&quot; concludes supply-sideconsultant Jeffrey Bell.   Mr. Jeffrey, the Buchanan research director, disagrees.&quot;Pat's not a protectionist,&quot; he insists. &quot;What Pat believesin is free trade, but as a national goal, not a nationalideology. There are things that are more valuable than freetrade as an absolute ideology.&quot;   A prolific writer, Mr. Buchanan has devoted columns overthe years to economic subjects, often taking sweepingpositions. In 1983, for instance, he wrote a column arguingthat the Social Security system should be made voluntary.Today, with the Florida primary one day away, &quot;he does notbelieve in voluntary Social Security,&quot; says Mr. Jeffrey.   And in a column written in April, Mr. Buchanan suggestedhe would support complete abolition of the income tax and avirtual closedown of the Internal Revenue Service. Theresult, he argued, would be &quot;an economic boom -- with no moreaudits, no more having to store vast records, no more havingto answer indecipherable computer-written IRS letters, nomore April 15. Free at last]&quot; At the end of the column, Mr.Buchanan invited readers to write for information to Citizensfor an Alternative Tax System, a group founded by members ofthe Church of Scientology.   &quot;He's not advocating that,&quot; Mr. Jeffrey says. &quot;He justfloated it as an idea.&quot;   On other occasions, Mr. Buchanan's ventures into economicmatters have disclosed a lack of knowledge. In a &quot;Crossfire&quot;program on the Cable News Network last year, he repeatedlyinsisted that the top tax rate on capital gains when RonaldReagan took office in 1981 was 70%. In fact, it was only 28%.   Still, a minority of supply-siders say they don't mind thefact that Mr. Buchanan is unschooled in economics. &quot;What doeshe need an economics program for? Bush doesn't have one,&quot;says economist Paul Craig Roberts, who served in RonaldReagan's Treasury Department.   Mr. Roberts -- who generally opposes bipartisancompromises on economic issues -- says he likes Mr. Buchananfor his pugnacious style. &quot;I think Pat Buchanan would bewonderful,&quot; he says. &quot;There'd be a four-year fistfight inWashington. He'd either clean out this town or they'd killhim.&quot;   ---   Jonathan Weil contributed to this article.   ---                        Buchanomics                                                                                                          Here are the major elements of Patrick Buchanan's economicproposals:                                                                                                          -- Cut income taxes for the &quot;working and middle classes.&quot;                                                                                                          -- Eliminate the capital-gains tax for people making lessthan $50,000 a year.                                                                                                          -- Halve the capital-gains tax rate for people making morethan $50,000 a year.                                                                                                          -- Enact an investment tax credit for business.                                                                                                          -- Freeze domestic discretionary spending, and enforce itwith a line-item veto.                                                                                                          -- Impose a two-year moratorium on new regulations.                                                                                                          -- Phase out foreign aid.                                                                                                          -- &quot;Play hardball&quot; on trade.</TEXT></DOC>
