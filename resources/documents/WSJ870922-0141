The British merchant bank also announced plans to raise #143.6 million after expenses with an underwritten rights issue of one new ordinary share for every three outstanding at a price of 450 pence ($7.45) apiece.    &quot;The rights issue will give us a stronger capital base from which to compete effectively in markets in which the group does business,&quot; Kleinwort said. &quot;We intend to maintain our position as one of the leading merchant-banking groups and to continue to develop an international securities business.&quot;    The bank plans to buttress its capital base further with loans.    Pretax profit fell to #37.9 million ($62.8 million) in the half from #57.7 million a year earlier. Net income fell 38%, to #24.2 million from #38.9 million.    The bank's securities division posted a loss of #7.5 million, which Kleinwort attributed to difficult conditions in dollar-denominated bond markets in the half and in British government bonds in the second quarter. The bank also incurred losses on warrants in the Eurobond market and has pulled out of that market.    The results were below most analysts' expectations. </TEXT></DOC>
