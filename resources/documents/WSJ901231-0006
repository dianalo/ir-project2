As the deposit insurance fund rapidly shrinks and fearsgrow that some large regional banks could soon fail,regulators are scrambling to find less expensive ways to dealwith insolvencies. One idea that is generating both attentionand controversy is to directly inject troubled institutionswith government money, perhaps even coupled with governmentownership.</LP><TEXT>   The idea isn't unheard-of. In 1984, the FDIC put up $4.5billion to bail out Continental Illinois Bank andamp; Trust Co.,took complete ownership of the Chicago bank and installed newmanagement. As the bank got back on its feet, the FDIC beganselling its stock and has recouped most of its money. Inefforts to arrange takeovers of some large Texas banks byBanc One Corp. and NCNB Corp., the FDIC also took temporaryownership interests.   But the regular use of such an approach would be asignificant break from current practice. In most cases now,the FDIC arranges the merger of a failed bank into a healthyone. The problem is that the cost of such arrangements to thetaxpayer can be huge: To make the merger work, the FDICitself takes over the failed bank's bad loans and other sourassets.   &quot;What really costs us money is the dead-weight loss ofassets when they come out of the banking system,&quot; says RogerWatson, the FDIC's director of research. As soon as the FDICassumes the bad loans from a failing bank that's being takenover, he says, the assets suffer an immediate loss of about15% in value. This is partly because the FDIC's goal is tosell, rather than manage, the portfolio.   FDIC officials say it might actually be cheaper to try tokeep the failed institutions alive. That's where the idea ofgovernment money and possible ownership comes in. A capitalinfusion into a bank that faces &quot;market-induced problems&quot;such as sour real estate loans can help it skate through atough period, says Steven Seelig, the FDIC's director ofliquidation.   Critics, though, contend that such changes could producedangerous results. A recent report prepared for the FinancialInstitutions subcommittee of the House Banking Committeewarned that FDIC investments in banks could lead to&quot;effective nationalizations of our major banks.&quot;   Moreover, say the critics, earlier attempts to givesavings and loans time to work their way out of problemsbackfired, producing larger, rather than smaller, losses forthe government. &quot;Forbearance doesn't work,&quot; says Rep. CharlesSchumer (D., N.Y.), a member of the banking panel. &quot;We havetwo choices: We can pay a little now or we can pay a lotlater.&quot;   Banking consultant Bert Ely argues that greater directgovernment involvement will only delay what he sees as aneeded consolidation among the nation's 12,400 banks. &quot;If thegovernment supplies capital to weak banks, it stacks the deckagainst the better managed institutions and doesn't allow asfast a shrinkage of the industry as should take place,&quot; hesays.   FDIC officials counter that things simply can't go on theway they are now. They figure the Bank Insurance Fund willincur gross losses of $11 billion in 1991, falling to $4billion by year end. FDIC Chairman William Seidman hasproposed that banks pay a one-time assessment equal to 1% oftheir deposits to pump $25 billion into the fund, but evenso, the agency says it has to find ways to slow down itsoutlays.   &quot;Because of current economic conditions, it's difficult tofind private buyers who can or want to purchase and fullycapitalize failed institutions,&quot; says Mr. Seidman. What'smore, he points out, &quot;the forced liquidation of large amountsof assets in weak markets is expensive,&quot; and is helping fuelthe downward spiral of real estate prices that iscontributing to the problems many banks face.   The FDIC's search for alternative ways of dealing withtroubled banks isn't limited just to the notion of takingthem over. Some analysts are beginning to talk of the needfor a modern version of the Reconstruction Finance Corp., thefederal agency that lent capital to some 6,000 banks to helpthem through the Depression. Lowell Bryan, a banking expertwith the management consulting firm of McKinsey andamp; Co.,recently briefed Mr. Seidman and other regulators on aproposal to use funds from the FDIC and private investors toshore up solvent but undercapitalized institutions.   One of the concerns driving the review is the FDIC'sconclusion that more large banks will fail. In 1990, 169banks failed, with assets totaling $16 billion; 148 of themwere so-called &quot;purchase and assumptions,&quot; leaving the FDICholding most of the bad assets. In 1991, the agency predicts,180 banks with total assets of $70 billion will fail --meaning that the average failed bank will be much larger thanit was in 1990.   Agency officials won't say which banks they expect tofail, but the $70 billion figure leaves enough room toinclude two large shaky banks in the Northeast -- the Bank ofNew England in Boston and Goldome Financial Corp. in Buffalo,N.Y.   Mr. Watson, the FDIC's research director, says regulatorshave learned enough from the Sandamp;L debacle to know &quot;you can'tforbear on an institution that has no chance of turningaround&quot; and &quot;you can't allow an institution to grow out ofits problems&quot; by making more risky loans.   Despite such lessons, finding a cheaper, easier way todeal with failing banks won't be easy. &quot;It's pretty clearthat if somebody comes up with a miracle that works and savesmoney, everybody will jump to it,&quot; says James McLaughlin, aregulatory attorney at the American Bankers Association. &quot;ButI don't think they're going to find a miracle cure.&quot;   ---           How the FDIC Deals With Failing Banks                                                                                                          Here's how the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. handled 169failing banks in 1990:                                                                                                          -- 148 by purchase and assumption. The deposits and someassets are sold to a sound bank and the FDIC takes over thebad loans. When banks are closed in this way, all deposits,even those above the $100,000 federal insurance ceiling, areprotected.                                                                                                          -- 20 by liquidation. The bank is closed and depositorsare paid up to the $100,000 insurance limit.                                                                                                          -- One assistance transaction. The FDIC makes a capitalinfusion to keep the bank alive.
