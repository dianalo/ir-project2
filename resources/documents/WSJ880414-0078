Bass Group is considering the sale of some assets of its Wometco Cable Co., which serves about 440,000 cable subscribers, according to Wall Street and cable industry sources.    If sold as a group, the systems could fetch $800 million or more at current prices of over $2,000 per subscriber.    David Bonderman, vice president of the Bass Group, based in Fort Worth, Texas, declined comment on the reports.    Industry sources said that while the Bass Group is unlikely to exit the cable business altogether, it is interested in selling a sizable chunk of its cable properties to take advantage of current prices for cable systems. With the deregulation of cable and the subsequent increase in subscriber fees, prices for cable systems have been steadily increasing since last year. But whether the spiral will continue is uncertain.    Miami-based Wometco operates cable systems in the Southeast. The Bass Group, in a 50-50 venture with Taft Broadcasting Co., purchased Wometco from the New York investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. in 1986 for about $620 million, and later acquired Taft's interest. KKR had earlier arranged a 1984 leveraged buy-out of Wometco Broadcasting Inc., which included the cable assets, for about $800 million.    Earlier this year, the Bass Group acquired a cable system in Atlanta from Prime Cable Corp. of Austin, Texas. That system is part of a separate group jointly operated by Prime and the Bass Group and isn't likely to be sold, sources said. </TEXT></DOC>
