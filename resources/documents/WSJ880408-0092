But its decision to retain a voluntary policing system and reject any move toward criminalizing insider trading leaves West Germany increasingly isolated from its European Common Market partners on the issue.    A working group on the issue, consisting of representatives of the eight West German stock exchanges and other institutions involved in securities trading, said the system of self-regulation has &quot;proved itself over the years.&quot; However, many of the other 11 Common Market countries have been pushing for a harmonization of trading rules before the scheduled unification of the countries' financial markets in 1992.    Among the new West German rules is one that bars inside information from being passed to persons outside a company except to meet legal obligations or &quot;protect justified interests.&quot;    The definition of insiders also was widened to include advisers and consultants as well as credit departments of financial institutions.    Trading in stock options also was placed under the insider rules for the first time, and the working group urged companies to give up the currently common practice of placing embargoes on the release of their earnings reports and other announcements. </TEXT></DOC>
