Associatedwith this warming there would be other changes, such as an increase inwintertime precipitation. Global observations are roughly in accord withthe predictions but do not yet provide full assurance that the modelsare right. Recent observations show that the springtime ozone depletionwhich has occurred over Antarctica since 1979 is caused, at least inpart, by man's CFC emissions. With regard to the more general long-termeffects of air pollution on the atmospheric ozone, the chemical theorypredicts a depletion of the total ozone by a few per cent in the nexttwo to three decades. There would be a larger depletion in the upperstratosphere, accompanied by an increase at lower levels. No statisticallysignificant trend in the globally averaged amount of total ozone hasbeen observed so far. However, the ozone concentrations seem to havedecreased slightly at high levels and increased at low levels, in qualitativeagreement with the theory.</TEXT></DOC>
