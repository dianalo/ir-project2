Kibbe</HL><DATE>04/03/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A20</SO><LP>   Even in death, former Republican National CommitteeChairman Lee Atwater is being derided for having dirtied theotherwise pristine waters of American politics. Newspapereditors and network anchors alike have wasted little timedelivering post-mortem proclamations that peg him as thefather of hardball politics and the founder of &quot;negativecampaigning.&quot;   Such assessments credit the man with too much whilefailing to give him his due. The real legacy of Lee Atwateris in his reaffirmation of a long-standing American tradition-- a healthy libertarian distrust of big government, politicsand, most important, all politicians, Democrat or not. Mr.Atwater himself summed it up best in a 1989 Washington PostMagazine interview: &quot;I'm a classical liberal thinker, and Ithink power is evil.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   What Mr. Atwater's detractors from the entrenched modernliberal political establishment deride as negativecampaigning might better be described as an attempt to imposesome modicum of truth in politics. &quot;What most people callnegative campaigning I prefer to call comparativecampaigning,&quot; Mr. Atwater wrote in the February issue of Lifemagazine. &quot;Negative makes it sound as if you're beating up onthe guy for no reason, which is different from choosingsymbolic platforms.&quot;   Honesty in politics probably is an unattainable ideal:While extolling the virtues of fiscal responsibility on thecampaign trail, most members of Congress invariably return toWashington to vote for new and higher outlays. Legislationthat raises congressional salaries by a whopping 37% istouted as an &quot;ethics&quot; bill. A promise of &quot;no new taxes&quot;produces the largest tax increase in American history. But itis a goal nonetheless useful as a means of imposing somesmall measure of accountability on a political systemtypically insulated from the criticisms of its mere citizens.   To say the least, Mr. Atwater's skilled dissection ofMichael Dukakis's 1988 presidential campaign disrupted thestatus quo. For once, a politician was held accountable forhis actions and the consequent misery he had imposed on hisconstituents. Massachusetts Miracle? Tough on violent crime?An honest look behind the facade of Gov. Dukakis's campaignrhetoric found him up to his neck in the tank of failedpublic policies. Talk about &quot;states as laboratories.&quot; Thesorry state of Mr. Dukakis's Massachusetts was persuasiveempirical evidence of all that is wrong with high taxes andmeddlesome government. From this perspective, the Republicanvictory in 1988 was not so much a victory for George Bush,but a victory against Michael Dukakis and all that herepresented.   But holding politicians responsible for their actions is atopic seldom broached in Washington. It violates thecollegiality of sacred institutions. If you happen to be oneof the few sacred cows, it's downright &quot;dirty.&quot; This, morethan anything else, is what explains the controversy thatsurrounded Lee Atwater, particularly in the last four yearsof his life. An unabashed cage-rattler and boat-rocker, Mr.Atwater represented everything that entrenched politiciansand bureaucrats despise. Like cornered animals, many bitback.   Like any human, Mr. Atwater made mistakes he would laterregret, particularly when he overstepped the bounds of&quot;comparative&quot; campaigning with undignified personal attacks.He was particularly bothered by his promise in 1988 to makeconvicted murderer Willie Horton Michael Dukakis's runningmate. He said, &quot;It makes me sound racist, which I am not.&quot;That these events stuck with him to his deathbed suggeststhat he was not the cold, calculating political operative hiscritics make him out to be, but rather a passionate man whowas deeply hurt by his own blunders, as well as by theperceptions of others.   Ironically, many of the policies so skillfully discreditedby Mr. Atwater and his staff during the 1988 campaign havesince been adopted by the Bush White House, both explicitlyand by default.   I don't think Lee would be all that surprised. &quot;Theultimate power,&quot; he commented in that same Washington PostMagazine interview, &quot;resides in the hands of those who areelected, and who are governing.&quot; While he did not (and couldnot) change the fundamental nature of political power, LeeAtwater certainly changed the way most Americans look at theelection process. For that, he has earned his small slice ofhistory.   ---   Mr. Kibbe was an economist at the Republican NationalCommittee during the first 15 months of Lee Atwater's tenureas chairman.</TEXT></DOC>
