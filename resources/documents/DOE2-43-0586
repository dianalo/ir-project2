Marginal welding preferably does not extendto the longitudinal edges of the strip, so that no bulging is causedif pressure is applied during welding, but preferably only slightly infrom those edges so that they are not liable to be caught and torn byhandling equipment. A strengthening strip may be similarly applied toa circumferential seam between two such lengths of flexible ducting.</TEXT></DOC>
