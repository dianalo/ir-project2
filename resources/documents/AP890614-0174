David Greenberg, part of the police duo that made hundreds ofarrests from 1968 to 1972, was charged in federal court in Brooklynwith forging documents and invoices to cheat an insurance companyafter one of his videotape businesses was hit by burglars.   The law-enforcement exploits of Greenberg and his police partner,Detective Robert Hantz, known as ``Robin,'' were recounted in the1973 book and the '74 movie ``The Super Cops.''   Greenberg quit the Police Department in 1975 and was laterelected to the state Assembly, where he served until he wasconvicted in 1978 on federal mail fraud and obstruction charges. Heserved 10 months of a two-year sentence.   Greenberg's brother and business partner, Bruce Greenberg, andtheir lawyer, Samuel Konigsberg, were also charged Wednesday.   According to court papers, after a Dec. 26, 1986, burglary atTri-State Video in Brooklyn, the three men fraudulently altereddocuments to show that Tri-State had been acquired by anotherGreenberg company, Home and Industrial Video of South Lodi, N.J.,four days before the break-in.   Under the acquisition, Greenberg argued, Tri-State was covered byHIV's $500,000 policy with the Chubb Group insurance companies.   According to the complaint, the Greenbergs inflated the losses,claiming $350,000 worth of videotapes had been taken.   Greenberg eventually settled his claim with Chubb for $1,000,according to the complaint.   Greenberg, 45, was arrested Wednesday at his home in Bel AirBeach, Fla., prosecutors said. Bruce Greenberg, 36, of StatenIsland, and Konigsberg, 34, with offices in Manhattan, surrendered.They were arraigned and freed on $50,000 bond each.   They are charged with mail fraud and insurance fraud and face 10years in prison and $500,000 fines each if convicted.   In 1987, James Brown, 45, a retired policeman who was presidentof one of Greenberg's other companies, Video U.S.A., a chain ofvideo rental stores, was shot to death. The killing has not beensolved. Law-enforcement sources said he was killed shortly before hewas to tell Chubb investigators about the burglary at Tri-StateVideo.</TEXT></DOC>
