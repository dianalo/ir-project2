The largest opposition party, the Socialists, expresseddissatisfaction with Nakasone's remarks, and repeated demands thegovernment summon him to testify before Parliament concerning thescandal.   ``If we can't get a satisfactory response from the government, weare ready to boycott the remaining Parliament session. I believeother opposition parties are ready to follow our line, too,'' saidOsamu Yatabe, a Socialist member of Parliament.   The scandal involves sales to 150 influential politicians andbusinessmen of bargain-priced shares in Recruit-Cosmos Co. beforethe stock was listed for public sale. When public trading began, theshare prices shot up and the bargain buyers profited handsomely.   The scandal has shaken the government, and prosecutors havearrested eight people on charges of bribery or violating securitieslaws.   Nakasone, who was prime minister in 1982-87, denied hisinvolvement in the scandal for the first time in an interview lastweek with CBS News.   Monday's news conference marked his first public comments to theJapanese on the affair. It also was the first time Nakasone publiclyacknowledged that his aides bought shares in Recruit-Cosmos, asubsidiary of the information service conglomerate Recruit Co.   He said the aides bought a total of 29,000 shares in September1986 and sold them the following month. He did not say how muchprofit they made.   Asked Monday if he would appear before Parliament, Nakasone said:``I don't believe it is necessary now that I have made everythingclear today, but I would follow the government's decision.''   He said he was to travel to the United States on Tuesday to givelectures at several universities.   Yatabe said the Socialist Party would press the government tosummon Nakasone, along with Hisashi Shinto, former chairman ofNippon Telegraph and Telephone Co., and Ihei Aoki, former secretaryto Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.   Opposition parties say they suspect Nakasone directed the gianttelephone utility to buy two supercomputers from a U.S. manufacturerand sell them to Recruit Co. The tranaction reportedly benefitedRecruit significantly.   Two former Nippon Telegraph vice presidents are among those whohave been arrested in the scandal.   More than 20 prominent people, including former Finance MinisterKiichi Miyazawa and two other Cabinet ministers, have resignedbecause of links to the affair.</TEXT></DOC>
