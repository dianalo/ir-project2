The bill, when combined with funds already approved for military construction and for the Department of Energy's management of the nuclear arsenal, would bring the total military budget for fiscal 1989 to $292 billion. That's just more than the $291.4 billion budget in the current fiscal year, and lower than the $299.5 billion sought by the administration.    The measure still must be reconciled with a House appropriations bill that would provide less money for several significant weapons programs, including the Strategic Defense Initiative anti-missile research program.    However, the defense budget is still snarled over the recent presidential veto of the separate defense-authorization bill, which sets spending ceilings on specific programs. The president said that bill would hold spending on SDI too low; so he may veto the appropriations bill too, if the Senate-passed spending levels are cut deeply in a compromise with the House.    Reacting to the government's nationwide investigation of alleged bribery and bid-rigging by defense consultants, the Senate adopted by voice vote a plan to regulate the consulting industry more tightly. The amendment, sponsored by Sen. David Pryor (D., Ark.), would require consultants for the Defense Department or its prime contractors to register with the Pentagon's office of standards of conduct. Among other things, consultants would have to disclose a list of clients.    An amendment passed earlier this week would limit the Defense Department to spending $2.38 billion on consulting contracts, or $420 million less than the $2.8 billion it spent in fiscal 1987, the last year for which figures are available. In recent years, the military services -- particularly the Navy -- have become increasingly dependent on outside consultants to analyze weapons proposals and design procurement strategies.    To put pressure on U.S. allies to bear a heavier defense burden, lawmakers voted to freeze U.S. military commitments in South Korea and Japan at current levels. The limit would be waived, however, if the Philippines throws the U.S. out of its bases there, a move that almost certainly would lead to a push for increased force levels elsewhere in the Pacific.    The Senate defense budget also would require the Pentagon to specify in future budget proposals what level of spending it seeks for various overseas forces. To date, the Pentagon has resisted presenting such region-by-region spending breakdowns, arguing that the defense budget is designed to support national security interests around the globe.    The Senate measure comes closer than either the House-passed appropriations bill or the vetoed authorization bill to providing the level of spending sought by the Reagan administration for its most prized strategic programs.    The Senate would provide $4.25 billion for SDI research. That's more than the House version or the authorization bill. The administration sought $4.6 billion for the anti-missile project.    The Senate measure would provide $687 million to develop a rail-car launcher for the MX missile, less than the $793 million sought by the administration but well above the $100 million the House earmarked for the controversial project.    The Senate bill would provide $50 million for the single-warhead Midgetman missile, for which the House would provide $600 million. The Reagan administration hoped to kill this planned weapon altogether, but after pressure from House supporters, agreed to seek $200 million so the project could be kept afloat until a new administration takes office.    In addition, the Senate's bill includes $199 million for the military's stepped-up drug interdiction efforts.    The defense budget has become entangled with presidential politics. More than in past years, Republicans have objected loudly to cuts imposed by the Democratic-controlled Congress, contending that they may be a preview of the &quot;weaker&quot; defense policies of Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee.    Meanwhile, Pentagon officials worry that program funding will be held up if the military budget is caught indefinitely in a political standoff. </TEXT></DOC>
