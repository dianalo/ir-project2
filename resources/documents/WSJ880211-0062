Boone Pickens Jr. rekindled its battle with Newmont Mining Corp. with a lawsuit charging that the New York-based mining company hasn't made good on its promise to restructure.    In a lawsuit filed yesterday in Potter County, Texas, state court, Ivanhoe Partners alleges that Newmont and its largest shareholder, Consolidated Gold Fields PLC -- which supported Newmont in its successful fight to fend off Ivanhoe's hostile $2 billion takeover bid last year -- misled Ivanhoe, other Newmont holders and the Delaware courts by saying it intended to restructure Newmont's operations to focus on its core gold business. The suit also says Newmont has failed to institute cumulative voting for the election of Newmont directors at its annual meeting, as it had vowed last September.    Newmont said it hasn't seen the litigation and couldn't comment specifically on it. &quot;As described in the news wires, the litigation is entirely without merit,&quot; Newmont said in a statement.    The Pickens group launched the battle last August with its purchase of a 9.1% stake in the company and a vow to take it over or propose a restructuring. A subsequent stock purchase by the group nullified Newmont's standstill pact with London-based Consolidated Gold, which then held a 26% stake. Consolidated soon lined up with Newmont, and boosted its stake in the company to nearly 50%, thus foiling Ivanhoe's bid.    The purchase of $1.78 billion of Newmont stock was made in a so-called street sweep, in which massive amounts of stock are purchased in a single-day blitz. Meanwhile, Newmont had announced a special $33-a-share payout. Ivanhoe promptly sued, unsuccessfully, alleging that Consolidated and Newmont illegally collaborated in the sweep to lock out Ivanhoe's $105-a-share tender offer.    A Newmont spokesman said the company has launched a &quot;serious program&quot; to sell assets to reduce the massive debt it incurred in fending off Ivanhoe's efforts. The company doesn't have a specific debt-level targeted, he said, &quot;but certainly with the direction we're heading. . .there will be a significant further reduction of that by year's end.&quot;    So far, Newmont has sold 4.2 million shares it held in E.I. duPont de Nemours andamp; Co., which enabled it to reduce its debt to $1.6 billion from $1.95 billion. Newmont also agreed to sell its Foote Mining Co. unit for about $74 million and has put up for sale all or part of its 75% stake in Newmont Australia Ltd., a gold mining concern, which could fetch up to $700 million. The company's two biggest non-gold assets -- its 50% stake in Peabody Holding Co., a big coal producer, and its oil unit -- aren't up for sale, the spokesman said.    But David Batchelder, a consultant to Mesa Limited Partnership, the largest investor in Ivanhoe Partners, said Newmont isn't concentrating on its core business, as it had promised. &quot;Their core business is gold, and we see them selling more gold assets as opposed to domestic assets that aren't gold,&quot; he said.    The lawsuit seeks actual and punitive damages. Alternatively, it wants Newmont to implement its promised restructuring and institute cumulative voting. Cumulative voting allows a stockholder to cast all the votes it has available for all board nominees in favor of just one nominee, thereby boosting its chances of naming a representative to the board.    Newmont's stock has plunged to about $30 a share recently from about $60 a share in September, indicating actual damages of about $150 million on Ivanhoe's five million Newmont shares. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Newmont closed yesterday at $32.50 a share, up 75 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
