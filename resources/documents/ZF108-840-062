MoserandM;The Irons Group Inc. is relying on old technology -- tape drives -- to solvea relatively new problem -- mainframe data access.andM;The company's Query 9-Track offering, which consists of file-conversionsoftware, a high-speed tape interface card and cabling, works in conjunctionwith standard nine-track tape drives to let Paradox database users tap intomainframe data.andM;Used with version 3.0 of Borland International Inc.'s Paradox database, Query9-Track translates standard Paradox query-by-example (QBE) queries toretrieve and convert mainframe data stored on tape into the appropriateParadox file format, according to officials at the New York-based company.andM;&quot;It's very similar to creating a table in Paradox,&quot; said James Davidson,president of The Irons Group.andP;  &quot;You can query files as if they were on yourhard disk, only Query 9-Track will query the tape, and you get back a Paradoxanswer table.&quot;andM;Tapping into mainframe data on nine-track tape drives in this way issignficantly faster than performing mainframe queries or using streamingtape, Davidson claimed.andP;  This is because Query 9-Track can access data atspeeds of megabytes per minute, compared with slower technologies thatoperate at bits per second, he explained.andM;In addition to speedier information access, another benefit of Query 9-Trackis that it only retrieves data specified by the request; the bulk ofinformation still remains on the nine-track tape, keeping users fromoverloading their hard drives with large, unwieldy data files, according toBen Tandowski, a user of Query 9-Track and the president of ProfessionalComputer Solutions Inc., a Paradox consulting firm based in Teaneck, N.J.andM;Query 9-Track would be most useful in a mainframe shop where users wish tomove data down to the PC and thus need tools for performing data conversion,Tandowski explained.andM;Query 9-Track can read mainframe data in ASCII or EBCDIC file formats and canconvert mainframe-formatted dates and numbers to a Paradox-readable form.andM;The developer recommends that users run Query 9-Track with Paradox on a 386-or 486-based PC with a high-speed hard-disk drive.andP;  The package is availablenow for $1,595.andM;The Irons Group Inc. can be reached at (212) 645-4737.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
