The Chicago Mercantile Exchange -- opposed to recent proposals that would give a single federal agency blanket authority over stock and stock-futures and options markets -- proposed its own patchwork alternative: forming an intermarket committee comprising securities and futures market regulators and exchange officials to coordinate actions affecting all markets.    Separately, the Chicago Board of Trade offered the New York Stock Exchange the use of its copyrighted, computerized trade-tracking system to help the Big Board more accurately monitor stock trades. The system would let the Big Board quickly pinpoint trading abuses.    The Board of Trade was among the most vocal critics of the Big Board's specialist system, and the exchange's ability to monitor trading activity and keep its markets open, during the October crash. The Big Board, in turn, has frequently blamed stock-futures and options trading for exacerbating that crash.    The exchanges' proposals surfaced yesterday, less than a day after a Securities and Exchange Commission staff report blasted stock-index futures trading for having an &quot;indirect negative effect&quot; during the stock market crash.    The report also suggested several steps that could cripple stock futures and options trading if enacted. They include creation of a specialist for trading stock indexes; physical rather than cash settlement of index products; and a review of stock futures and options margins that most industry officials say would lead to margins on these products being substantially increased.    The intermarket group proposed by the Merc &quot;will be charged with ensuring that these interrelated markets do not disconnect, which was identified by the Brady commission as a principal problem in October,&quot; said Leo Melamed, the Merc's special counsel and chairman of its executive committee. The Brady commission was appointed by President Reagan to study the October market crash.    The Merc initiative faces long odds. Even as the exchange released its proposal, SEC Chairman David Ruder told the Senate Banking Committee yesterday that his agency, which oversees the securities markets, should extend its regulatory reach to stock futures.    The Merc also proposed adjustable daily price limits for its Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures, as well as a unique opening-price limit range, in addition to other financial safeguards.    On Oct. 23, the Merc installed 30-point daily price limits on Sandamp;P 500 stock-index futures on an emergency basis. Since the crash the Sandamp;P 500 future hasn't moved 30 points in a day.    The Merc now proposes an adjustable limit that would widen as the index future climbs in price. The limit would be 15 index points when the index value is between zero and 275 points; 20 points when it is between 275 and 325 points; and 25 points when the index is above 325 points.    Yesterday, Sandamp;P 500 stock-index futures for March settlement closed down 2.75 at 253.10, after trading within an eight-point range during the day.    The Merc also proposed an opening limit of five index points during the first 10 minutes of trading. That &quot;would give the market a pause at a critical time if opening order imbalances occur,&quot; said John F. &quot;Jack&quot; Sandner, Merc chairman.    In addition to the limits, the Merc suggested increased security-deposit requirements for clearing member firms; routine intraday, rather than overnight, financial settlements by clearing members, with losses collected and gains paid out; stiffer futures-options margins; and broker capital requirements based on the risk level of their trading positions.    Merc officials are to testify today before the Senate Banking Committee on their proposed responses to the crash.    In its letter to the Big Board, the Board of Trade said both Nicholas Brady, chairman of the presidential task force on the crash, and the SEC's Mr. Ruder praised its ability to reconstruct trading activity.    &quot;Once the New York Stock Exchange is able to generate such information, we can jointly move forward to provide the sort of intermarket coordination which the Brady task force so forcefully endorses,&quot; the Board of Trade said to Big Board Chairman John Phelan in a Feb. 2 letter, a copy of which was obtained by this newspaper.    The Board of Trade trades futures on the Major Market Index of 20 blue-chip stocks, which closely mirrors the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 stocks.    A Big Board spokesman said the exchange couldn't comment until it has received a copy of the letter. </TEXT></DOC>
