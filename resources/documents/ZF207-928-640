(Bellevue, WA) was established in 1982 by two former BoeingComputer Service engineers and first released db_VISTA in September 1984.andO;Raima products are currently installed on more than 4000 mini- andmicrocomputers used by some 2700 commercial and government organizationslocated in more than 50 countries.andM;For this review, the Raima software was installed and tested on a HArrisHCX-9 running HCX/UX 3.0 (UNIX System V.2 with 4.3BSD extensions).andM;InstallationandM;Installation of db_VISTA and db_REVISE is fairly straightforward and generic.andO;Raima seems to have made a good compromise between installationautomatization and breadth of platform support for these two products.andM;We found, however, that the installation notes for db QUERY were incomplete.andO;Several files, such as libvista.a, had to be copied or linked from the dbVISTA directory, although there was no mention of this in the installationnotes.andP;  A call to Raima's technical support phone line quickly filled in themissing information, however.andM;DocumentationandM;Considering the complexity of db_VISTA, its documentation is reasonablycomplete.andP;  The db_VISTA User's Guide, db VISTA Reference Manual, db QUERYUser's Guide, and db REVISE User's Guide are all well organized and wellwritten.andP;  The db_VISTA Reference Manual describes db_VISTA utility programsand runtime library functions in a format similar to that used in the UNIXmanual pages.andP;  Unfortuinately, the reference manual is not available ason-line man pages for UNIX systems.andP;  The reference manual contains usefulexamples for each runtime library function.andM;The db_VISTA User's Guide also includes many helpful examples.andP;  Both thedb_VISTA User's Guide and the db_QUERY User's Guide, however, could benefitfrom the addition of a tutorial.andM;Implementation and Feature SetandM;This product is designed for use by professional applications developers.andP;  Itis written in C and is portable to almost any C language environment.andP;  If aversion is not already available for a system, Raima's professional servicesgroup will port it, upon request.andP;  Porting usually takes one to four weeks,and the cost is negotiated on a case-by-case basis.andM;Source code licenses are also available.andP;  The complete source code can beobtained and customized or enhanced by the purchaser.andP;  Applicationsdeveloped, compiled, and linked using any of the modules of the system may bedistributed royalty-free.andM;Raima currently supports a number of operating systems, including MacOS,MS-DOS, OS/2, and VMS, as well as several flavors of UNIX.andM;The DBMS is based on a combination of the network database model and theB-tree indexing method.andP;  It can handle a broad range of applicationsrequirements, from simple ISAM development to large transaction-intensivemultiuser applications.andP;  For a list of some of db_VISTA's components andcapabilities, see Figure 1.andM;The product includes a robust set of development tools designed for use byprogrammers and database administrators.andP;  These support multiuser andsingle-user applications, transaction logging and recovery, record and filelocking, multiple database access, a database definition language patternedafter C, a database dictionary, and fast data access.andP;  Unfortunately, Raimadoes not provide a Query-by-Example interface like Oracle's SQL*Forms.andM;Database manipulation and control operations are performed through calls tothe runtime library.andP;  Runtime library functions allow applications to openand close database, create and modify records and fields, connect anddisconnet sets, search for records through keys and sets, and controlmultiuser access.andM;db_QUERY supports ad hoc (standalone) or embedded queries and the generationof reports on db_VISTA 3.1 databases.andP;  It is based on the Structured QueryLanguage (SQL), which was originally developed for use with relationaldatabases.andP;  The db_QUERY function library can be linked with C applicationsto give users the ability to create customized query programs for use with adb_VISTA database.andM;The query language allows users to define and display relational views of adb_VISTA database for conditional selection, sorting, and reporting.andP;  It alsoincludes the source code for an SQL-based interface program called db_query.andO;This is very helpful to users who want to design and build their own custominterfaces.andM;db_REVISE is a database restructuring program used for modifying db_VISTAdatabases without re-entering the data or writing customized conversionprograms.andP;  It helps database administrators avoid much of the inconvenienceassociated with modifying and maintaining network-model databases, includingthe need to write and debug in-house conversion programs or to export andimport database contents.andM;db_REVISE is a powerful tool that provides more flexibility than is found inmost network DBMSs.andP;  With db_REVISE, it is possible to: reorganize filecontents or page sizes; add or delete records, fields, sets, and files;convert data-field types; and join, project, and noramlize sets and records.andM;Error HandlingandM;Error handling in db_VISTA and db_QUERY is well documented andstraightforward.andP;  All db_VISTA runtime functions return an integer databasestatus code as the value of the function.andP;  These status codes are organizedinto three categories:andM;* user errors, which correspond to programming errors.andP;  They indicate eitherthat the arguments to a function are not correct or that the databaseenvironment has not been properly set up.andP;  All user errors can and should becorrected by the programmer.andM;* system errors, which occur when db_VISTA detects an abnormal databasecondition.andP;  Only the &quot;S_NOSPACE - No more space on file&quot; system error isrecoverable.andP;  All other system errors indicate that a serious problem existsand that processing should be terminated immediately.andP;  Usually, these errorsresult from an application progrmming mistake that is corrupting the db_VISTAruntime environment.andM;* function status, which is returned to inform the program of normal functionresults.andM;In db_QUERY, status codes represent normal, expected results from functioncalls.andP;  Error codes usually represent some kind of language statement errorsuch as a syntax error.andP;  Most of the status and error codes are returned fromthe functions d query and q sqlinit as they perform statement parsing andsetup.andM;The system displays warnings during the compilation phase of db_REVISE when apotential error condition exists or when db REVISE will not be able toperform a specified action.andP;  Actual errors detected during compilation willterminate the compilation.andM;Warnings are also provided during the execution phase of db REVISE when anaction cannot be carried to completion or when data is lost.andP;  Errors duringthe execution phase will cause db REVISE to close any open databases andterminate.andM;SupportandM;All Raima products include an initial 60 days of free technical support,which starts the day the product is received.andP;  Extended ApplicationsDevelopment Support (EADS) is also available and includes telephone supportand consultation, product updates and upgrades, and bulletin board service.andO;The yearly charge for the EADS service is 15 percent of the product cost($295 per year minimum).andM;Users registered for support have access to a special-purpose bulletin board.andO;Using this, they can get the latest product information, upload data toRaima's technical support department, download code or other information, orleave messages for Raima support personnel.andM;Raima also conducts regional and on-site training courses.andP;  In the &quot;basics&quot;course, instructors give new uses an introduction to the basic principles ofoperation and features of the db VISTA package.andP;  Advanced classes focusprimarily on multiuser applications.andP;  In the company's &quot;internal&quot; course,participants are exposed to the db_VISTA system design structure.andP;  Complexapplication information and product internals are usually presented by theproduct's developers.andM;Raima's professional services group can assist customers with hardwareporting, db VISTA source code modification, in-depth consultation, designoptimization, applications and product development, and turnkey systemsdevelopment.andM;Raima's db VISTA DDS customer support is competent, professional, and--givendb VISTA's large set of sophisticated development tools--essential.andM;The db VISTA Data DictionaryandM;The database dictionary is created by ddlp and contains tables that arecreated from a database definition language (DDL) file.andP;  The name of thedictionary file is the database name followed by .dbd.andM;The dictionary file contains information about a db VISTA database.andP;  The manyfields describe such things as: the db VISTA version number, the maximum sizeof a database page, the number of entries in each of the various tables, andinformation about the various tables db VISTA uses.andM;The db VISTA III Database Development System (DDS), is a powerful DBMS thatincludes a robust set of development tools designed for professionalapplications developers and database administrators.andP;  It is written in C andis portable to almost any C language environment.andM;The db VISTA III DDS supports multiuser and single-user applications,transaction logging and recovery, record and file locking, multiple databaseaccess, a database definition language patterned after C, a databasedictionary, and fast data access.andP;  Unfortunately, the db VISTA III DDS doesnot provide a query-by-example interface like Oracle's SQL*Forms, and it doesnot restrict data access through the use of passwords.andM;The db VISTA User's Guide, db_VISA Reference manual, db_QUERY USer's Guide,and db_REVISE User's Guide are all well organized and well written.andO;Unfortunately, the db VISTA Reference Manual is not available as on-line manpages for UNIX systems.andM;Although db QUERY and db_REVISE aren't required, they are certainly desirablefor serious database applications.andP;  The db_QUERY module can greatly reducedevelopment time for interactive applications, and db_REVISE eases the choreof modifying db VISTA III databases.andM;To this author's knowledge, despite its shortcomings the db_VISTA III DDS isthe best DBMS based on the network data model that is available for a widevariety of UNIX platforms.andM;Steve Lindsey, this month's reviewer, is a lead software engineer for HarrisCorp.'s government systems sector in Palm Bay, FL.andP;
