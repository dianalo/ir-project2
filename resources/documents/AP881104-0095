(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prosecutors examining PTL's finances havenotified Jim Bakker and several former associates they are targetsof a grand jury investigation, an indication indictments may beimminent, a newspaper reported today.   ``A target of the grand jury investigation is a person as to whomthe prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linkinghim to the commission of a crime and who, in the judgment of theprosecutor, is a putative defendant,'' federal prosecutor CharlesAlexander wrote, The Charlotte Observer reported.   The newspaper said Bakker, PTL chief builder Roe Messner; andRichard Dortch, Bakker's former top deputy, received the letter. Allthree have been invited to testify before the grand jury the week ofNov. 28.   Alexander's Oct. 24 letter to Bakker cites Justice Departmentguidelines in inviting Bakker to testify, including a requirement hegive up his right against self-incrimination and consent to a fullexamination under oath.   ``Any and all testimony which you provide can be used against youby the grand jury and in subsequent legal proceedings. ... Thisletter is not a subpoena, and you are not compelled to appear,'' thenewspaper quoted the letter as saying.   Alexander has refused even to acknowledge the grand jury'sexistence. He declined comment Thursday.   Bakker said in a statement that he would not appear before thegrand jury.   Bakker resigned from PTL in March 1987 in a sex-and-moneyscandal. The grand jury has been investigating the evangelicalempire for possible mail and wire fraud, conspiracy and taxviolations since August 1987.   Bakker has denied any wrongdoing and said in August that if he isindicted, ``it'll be because somebody framed us and set us up.''   Bakker attorney Jim Toms said that despite the target letter, hedoesn't think prosecutors have decided to indict Bakker. Toms saidhe hopes to meet with prosecutors ``to reach a just and equitablesolution to this distressing situation.''   ``I do sense they are to the point where they know pretty wellwhere they want to head,'' Toms said, ``and it's time to open adialogue.''   Bill Diehl, who represents Dortch, said the letter is a clearsignal prosecutors are going to indict the targets. ``It's a donedeal,'' he said.   Former federal prosecutor Kenneth Andresen, who representsBakker's former secretary, agreed. He noted the investigation hasgone on for 16 months.   ``If prosecutors don't think they've uncovered evidence ofwrongdoing, there's no need to give the targets an opportunity toexplain their conduct,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
