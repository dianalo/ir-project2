No pickup.</HEAD><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israel will try to ensure free access to theresort of Taba for Israeli vacationers when it opens talks withEgypt later this week on the disputed border area, Foreign MinisterMoshe Arens said.   Taba, a 250-acre strip of land at the northern tip of the RedSea, has troubled Egyptian-Israeli relations since Israel refused togive back the land when it completed its withdrawal from the SinaiDesert in 1982.   Israel's Cabinet decided Monday that the government will not setany preconditions for the negotiations, which open Thursday in Tabaand will involve Israeli, Egyptian and U.S. delegations.   Israel occupied Taba and the Sinai Desert in the 1967 Middle Eastwar and returned the desert to Egypt in accordance with the 1979U.S.-mediated peace treaty.   The Taba dispute went to international arbitration. Last Sept.29, a five-member panel met in Geneva and awarded Egypt somedisputed key border points, but said it was not authorized todetermine the final demarcation line.   The debate now hinges on the sovereignity over the actual beacharea, which has an Israeli-owned hotel and a cabana.   At the Cabinet meeting, right-wing Trade Minister Ariel Sharoninsisted on linking the Taba negotiations with full normalization ofties between the two countries. The Cabinet rejected the idea.   Arens expressed hope the Cabinet decision would pave the way forimproved ties: ``We have paid the price for peace and now we want toensure the improvement of relations.   ``We hope to create conditions for the continuing presence ofIsraelis in the area ... and to solve the problem of compensation byEgypt to the owners of the hotel,'' he said on Israel army radio.``We hope the Egyptians are interested in developing the ties, inturning Taba into an example of coexistence.''   The radio said Israeli negotiators were instructed to seek freeaccess to Taba for vacationing Israelis and common management of theSonesta hotel there.</TEXT></DOC>
