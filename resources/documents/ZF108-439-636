WhiteandM;Associate Manager of the Computer Science Laboratory Xerox Palo Alto ResearchCenter, Palo Alto, CA BiographyandM;John R. White is Associate Manager of the Computer Science Laboratory at theXerox Palo Alto Research Center and Vice President of the ACM.andP;  His 25 yearcareer in computing has included positions as a systems programmer, computerscience professor, and research manager.andP;  He has been a member of ACM since1969 and has served in senior ACM volunteer positions for over 10 years.andM;John received his B.A.andP;  degree in mathematics (with honors) and his M.S.andP;  andPh.D.andP;  degrees in computer science from the University of California at SantaBarbara.andP;  From 1967-71 he was a member of the technical staff of the ComputerResearch Laboratory at UC Santa Barbara where he worked on the development ofearly time-sharing systems.andP;  In 1973 he joined the Faculty of the EECSDepartment at the University of Connecticut where he served as an Assistantand then Associate Professor of Computer Science.andP;  From 1979-81 he chairedthe Computer Science Division.andM;In 1982 John joined the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) where he wasresponsible for experimental distributed systems supporting the activities ofthe Integrated Circuits Laboratory.andP;  He joined PARC's Computer ScienceLaboratory (CSL) in 1984 where he has held management positions of increasingresponsibility moving into his present position as Associate Manager inNovember 1988.andP;  His research interests center on software engineering anddistributed systems.andM;From 1977-83 John was a member of the SIGPLAN Executive Committee serving asSecretary-Treasurer, Vice Chairman and Chairman.andP;  He has been a member of theSIG Board since 1983 and chaired the Board from 1986-88.andP;  He co-chaired the1981, 1982, and 1983 POPL Symposia and was general chairman of the SIGPLAN'82and SIGPLAN'83 Symposia.andP;  In 1986 John chaired the ACM Conference on theHistory of Personal Workstations.andM;In addition to ACM, John is a member of the IEEE Computer Society, Sigma Xi,a Director of the Computer Research Board, and a member of the EditorialBoard of Computer Languages.andP;  He was elected Vice President of the ACM in1988 and has been a member of ACM Council since 1984.andP;  John served on theBoard of Directors and Executive Committee of the Computing SciencesAccreditation Board from 1984-86.andP;  He was a member of the ACM DoctoralDissertation Award Committee for three years and chaired the committee in1985.andM;StatementandM;ACM needs farsighted leadership-leadership that not only understands thefield and the technology, but leadership that comprehends the forces thatwill impact and shape the computing discipline, the industry, and theprofession in the 90's.andP;  I seek your vote for President because I believe Ican provide that leadership.andM;I bring to the Presidency my skills as a computer scientist and manager ofcomputing research at Xerox PARC and a record of leadership andaccomplishment within ACM that spans offices from SIGPLAN Chairman to ACMVice President.andP;  I lead by doing, by working well with people, and byeliciting the best from them.andM;When I ran for the Vice Presidency in 1988, ACM was in transition.andP;  It wasgrappling with a dramatic shift in its financial base stemming from thedemise of the NCC.andP;  It was being forced to re-evaluate the programs it wassupporting, to consider seriously issues of technical excellence in itsplanning, and to examine its own governing structure.andM;As Vice President I have worked hard to start ACM moving through thistransition.andP;  I was a leader in the effort to convince Council, despitedecades of intransigence, to restructure ACM governance and increase SIGrepresentation.andP;  I led the effort to develop a relationship with theComputing Research Board to represent the needs of the research community.andP;  Ihelped lead Council in making tough decisions regarding the location of ACMHeadquarters.andP;  Most importantly, I brought into existence the SIGDiscretionary Fund which is at the heart of our partnership with ACM SIGS.andO;In the coming year this fund will provide over $600,000 to support a broadspectrum of ACM activities.andM;As we enter the 90's, ACM membership is at its highest level in history.andO;Moreoever, ACM is poised to make this decade one in which it has real impacton the field and takes a broader and more active role in the internationalcommunity.andM;While the opportunities are great, there is still much to be done to positionACM as the premier society in computing.andM;* We need to improve ACM's financial outlook and commit to a plan forbringing expenses in line with revenues.andM;* We need to establish an on-going process for evaluating member satisfactionwith ACM products and services.andP;  * We need to develop new products thatbetter meet the requirements of the practicing computing professional.andP;  * Wemust start benchmarking operational aspects of ACM so that we improve thedelivery of services and give you a better return on your membershipinvestment.andP;  * We must broaden ACM involvement with issues important to theprofession and the public e.g., intellectual property rights, security andprivacy).andP;  *  We need a realistic plan for enhancing our role as aninternational organization.andM;Maintaining our momentum and moving ACM into the 90's requires farsighted andeffective leadership.andP;  With my broad experience in the computing field andwithin the Association, I am prepared to exercise the leadership ACM deservesfrom its President.andM;Dennis J. FraileyandM;Senior Member of Technical Staff Texas instruments, Dallas, Texas BiographyandM;B.S.andP;  (magna cum laude), Mathematics, University of Notre Dame (1966); M.S.andO;and Ph.D., Computer Science, Purdue University (1968, 1971); Thesis topic:Machine independent compiler code optimization; NDEA Fellowship.andM;Dennis' career includes both academic and industrial experience, and hemaintains a strong, continuing interest in each.andP;  He was first introduced tocomputing as a scientific and system programmer for the Ford ScientificResearch Lab (Summers, 1962-68), and during his college years he worked atthe Notre Dame and Purdue computing centers.andP;  He joined Southern MethodistUniversity in 1970 as Assistant Professor of Computer Science, earningpromotions to Associate in 1974 and tenure in 1975.andP;  In 1973 Dennis beganconsulting for Texas Instruments, specializing in design of real timeoperating systems and simulation of seismic data processing architectures.andO;He accepted a full time position with TI in 1977, but continued adjunctteaching at SMU and the University of Texas at Austin, where he won an awardfor outstanding teaching in 1985.andP;  His work at TI has included computerarchitecture research, embedded training, expert systems, softwaredevelopment management, and speech writing for company executives (notablythe keynote address for the 1977 National Computer Conference).andP;  He currentlyheads a team designing a preferred software engineering process for TI.andM;Professional activity has included membership on over a dozen conferencecommittees, chairmanship of three technical program committees including the1984 NCC, and service as a computer science accreditation visitor since 1986.andO;He was elected a senior member of IEEE in 1987.andM;In ACM, Dennis served as Vice President (86-88) and South Central RegionalRepresentative (81-86), was President of the Purdue Student chapter, and heldvarious offices in the Dallas Chapter.andP;  Three ACM presidents have selectedhim to chair committees, including institutional membership, membershipbenefits, and governance; and he currently serves on the outstandingcontribution award, Computing Surveys review, and regional governancecommittees.andP;  Dennis is active in SIGARCH and SIGOPS, and is an ACM alternateboard member to CSAB.andM;Dennis is author of over 30 technical papers, has written on computerarchitecture for two encyclopedias, and is a frequent speaker at ACM chaptermeetings and other computing functions.andM;StatementandM;I have a vision for ACM.andP;  I joined in 1965, at a time when ACM was THE placeto publish and read about computing.andP;  Fresh thinkers weren't alienated bybureaucracy.andP;  Tutorial publications could be understood by anyone.andP;  Newmembers didn't have to wait three months for an acknowledgement and up to sixmonths to receive their publications.andP;  There was an excitement, a vitality, avigor.andP;  I want to bring back that spirit.andM;I've made my mark at ACM by getting things done: peering into the murkybureaucracy, identifying the core causes of problems, and fixing them.andP;  Forexample, in my last ACM election statement I outlined a three-fold agenda:ACM finances; Computing Surveys; and new blood.andM;* As vice president I formed the board chairs into a budget planning body,streamlining the budgeting process and improving the bottom line.andM;* On the Computing Surveys review committee, I pushed for professionalediting, more tutorials, and timely, prominent treatment of &quot;hot&quot; topics.andO;These improvements are now underway.andM;* Fundamental restructuring was needed to cut bureaucracy and get new peopleinvolved.andP;  I chaired the governance committee which made this happen.andP;  In1991, Council will be downsized for operating efficiency, the nominatingcommittee will include SIG and Chapter representatives, and there will be anew, more member-friendly regional structure.andP;  These and otheraccomplishments required people skills, organizing abilities and perspective.andO;Because of my unique combination of industrial and academic experience, I'vebeen able to break through deadlocks on divisive issues such as institutionalmembership dues, regional redistricting, and research vs.andP;  applications.andO;Many such issues lie ahead.andM;My platform has three goals:andM;* make ACM more responsive to its members, SIGs and chapters;andM;* preserve and build on ACM's many strengths;andM;* make ACM more relevant to computing today.andM;To achieve these goals I will promote:andM;* an &quot;800&quot; number for headquartersandM;* regional offices in Asia and EuropeandM;* more voter information about election candidatesandM;* publication reviews and new publications guided byandM;* member needsandM;* the growth of current and new SIGsandM;* more member surveysandM;* more effective use of membership dataandM;* programs that make ACM more visible to the publicandM;* continued efforts for new blood in the organizationandM;One improvement can be started now.andP;  I believe candidates and officers shouldbe accessible to each and every member.andP;  Send me e-mail atfrailey@csc.ti.com, or call me at 214-995-0388.andM;I hope you share my goals for ACM.andP;  We're in this together.andP;  With yoursupport I can make ACM a winner again.andM;Bryan S.

Women of Science 1989.andM;StatementandM;Two years ago you challenged me to put some action behind the rhetoric thatusually appears here.andP;  You got it !andP;  Over the last two years we've built ateam dedicated to moving ACM forward in all areas, not just in narrow areasof technical excellence.andP;  In our first two years, we started excitingprojects:andM;* Sponsoring production of a six hour TV &quot;special&quot; on computing.andP;  This PBSseries will air next year.andM;* Sponsoring a National Academy of Sciences' workshop and proposingsponsorship of additional work by NAS.andM;* Creating a &quot;blue ribbon&quot; commission to clarify intellectual property rightsin software.andM;To address fast moving issues, I've written letters you've seen inCommunications of the ACM:andM;* Urging establishment of a computing Nobel prize (3/89)andM;* Denouncing China's suppression of dissent (8/89)andM;* Promoting international space exploration (10/89)andM;* Asking you to write your Congressmen about high performance computing andtwo other bills (2/89 andamp; 1/90)andM;The results of our activist stance are showing already.andP;  Membership is now atan all time high.andP;  Look at the results we've achieved in just two years.andM;July  86-           July  88andM;-         Growth                   June  88           November'89andM;* total membership                  - 8.7%             + 11%andM;* regular membership                - 2.9%             + 5.7%andM;* SIG membership                    - 7.4%             + 5.1%andM;* student membership              - 32.6%             + 42.1%andM;* member subscriptions            - 12.5%              + 6.8%andM;Corporations have noticed the change.andP;  When I became president of ACM, onlythe Grace Murray Hopper award was sponsored by a corporation.andP;  Today, threeawards and the student programming contest are funded by corporations.andM;We've changed ACM's internals too.andP;  For example, ACM Council voted to reduceits size from 25 to 15 members and elected a publishing professional to chairthe Publications Board.andP;  We changed Executive Directors.andP;  A strategic planfor the nineties was established (12/89) and its recommendations are beingimplemented.andM;We have come a long way over the last two years, but we all know that ACM cando better.andP;  To do more requires teamwork and the full participation of theSIGS.andP;  ACM officers must work as a team.andP;  To fulfill its responsibility tothe profession and society, ACM must become part of the government andindustry team.andP;  We need you to select candidates with real devotion toteamwork for the advancement of ACM.andM;We have changed ACM's course from dismal decline to steady progress.andP;  We arebuilding relationships with the government, corporations, the media, andnational institutions.andP;  When you're turning the corner, its no time to let goof the wheel.andP;  I need your support to drive toward the great goals we've set.andM;For Vice-President (for two years)andM;S.andP;  Ron OliverandM;Department of Computer Science Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, CAandM;BiographyandM;S.andP;  Ron Oliver grew up in Iowa, where he completed the B.A.andP;  degree inMathematics and Philosophy at Morningside College in 1970.andP;  A philosophicaland mathematical logician by nature, he completed the M.S.andP;  degree inComputer Science at the University of Kansas in 1975, and the Ph.D.andP;  inComputer Science at Colorado State University in 1988.andM;Ron has accumulated some 22 years of experience in various aspects ofcomputing.andP;  Recently, most of his work has been in the areas ofcommunications, simulation, real time languages, and distributed systems.andO;His dissertation research was an analytical and simulation study ofcommunication protocols for satellite systems.andP;  Current research effortsinvolve developing language features and Object Oriented Design techniquesfor real time and distributed systems and simulations, using Ada.andM;Previous employers include Science Applications International Corporation,the MITRE Corporation, the Computer Science department at the University ofColorado in Colorado Springs, the Computer Systems division of Perkin-Elmer,and the University of Kansas Computation Center.andM;An active member of ACM since 1974, Ron belongs to SIGSMALL/PC, SIGCOMM,SIGCSE, and SIGAda, and participates in local chapter activities regularly.andO;He has served several terms as an officer of SIGSMALL/PC and has beeninvolved as an organizer or participant in more than 13 Conferences sponsoredby ACM.andP;  Currently, Ron is the Chair of the SIG Board, and has filled otherpositions on the SIG Board and ACM Council in the recent past.andM;StatementandM;For more than 10 years I have been actively involved in volunteer managementfor ACM, devoting most of my energies helping resolve ACM financialdifficulties.andP;  From the time I first became involved in SIG leadership, untilnow, many SIGs that were in the red, or nearly so, have become solvent.andP;  Atthe present time SIGS, in general, are financially sound.andP;  For the past fouryears I have been helping to resolve similar financial difficulties for theAssociation as a whole.andP;  These problems are not yet resolved, but there hasbeen substantial progress toward resolution.andP;  If elected Vice President, Iwill continue to work for financial solvency for ACM, while insisting thatall ACM programs excel in technical quality.andP;  Many ACM programs areexcellent, but others could be improved.andP;  I will work to ensure that all ACMsubunits pay their own way, as the SIGs do, in terms of Headquarters andvolunteer management costs.andP;  Radical changes in financial accounting andmanagement techniques will be necessary to achieve these goals.andP;  It will alsobe necessary to institute considerable change in membership processing andawareness.andM;Frank L. FriedmanandM;Associate Professor Computer and Information Sciences, Temple University,Philadelphia, PAandM;BiographyandM;Dr.andP;  Friedman received his B.A.andP;  in Mathematics (Antioch College, 1965) andM.A.andP;  and Ph.D.andP;  degrees in Computer Science (Purdue University, 1972 and1974 respectively).andP;  His dissertation was titled Decompilation and theTransfer of Operating Systems for Small General-Purpose Computers.andP;  He alsoholds an M.S.andP;  in Numerical Science  Johns Hopkins University, 1969).andM;In 1974 Dr. Friedman joined the faculty of the Computer Science Department atTemple University in Philadelphia, PA, as an Assistant Professor.andP;  He hasbeen an Associate Professor there since 1978 and served as departmentchairman from 1985-88.andP;  During 1984-85, Dr. Friedman was a Senior ComputerScientist at Computer Sciences Corporation in Moorestown, Nj.andP;  He iscurrently on leave from Temple and is a Visiting Computer Scientist at theSoftware Engineering Institute in Pittsburgh.andP;  Dr. Friedman served as theDirector of the Computer Center at Goucher College in Baltimore, MD (1969-70)and as Assistant Director (1967-69).andP;  His main areas of interest includesoftware engineering (software design, language/program portability andadaptability), programming languages, and computer science education.andP;  He haspublished over two dozen papers in these areas and co-authored  with ElliotB. Koffman) four introductory programming textbooks, one of which is in itsfourth edition.andM;Dr.andP;  Friedman joined ACM in 1970 and is currently the Chairman of the ACMConferences Board, a position he has held since 1986.andP;  Prior to that he wasthe Allegheny Region Representative to ACM Council (1982-86) and an advisorto and member of the Conferences Board (1984-86).andP;  He served as GeneralChairman of the three conferences: the ACM Conference on the History ofScientific and Numeric Computation (May, 1987), the 1984 ACM Computer ScienceConference February, 1984) and the 1987 National Educational ComputingConference.andP;  Dr. Friedman is also a member of the Computer Society of theIEEE.andM;StatementandM;In recent years, ACM has commissioned three strategic planning reports.andO;These reports provided recommendations designed to ensure that theAssociation remains a leading and influential organization in the computingfield.andM;All of the recommendations are important, but one stands out as critical toACM, the computing field, and society.andP;  It involves an effort to build anincreased awareness on the part of computing professionals, the public, andlawmakers as to the certain impact of computing in the world community andthe issues raised in each affected segment of this community.andP;  This work mustbe the primary focus of ACM leaders, especially the new Executive Committeeand Council.andM;We are involved in a most exciting, high impact field.andP;  Computing is THEcentral enabling technology; new hardware and software advances will surelyhave a major impact upon every other field of endeavor.andP;  Progress incomputing will affect the speed and efficiency with which world problems aresolved or new insights gained, and it can have a remarkable impact on theeffective use of human resources.andP;  if used with careful thought and planning,computers can play an important role in improving the quality of life in theworld community.andM;Yet awareness of the critical position of computing technology, even amongour colleagues, is far too low.andP;  We must, as a field, begin to advocate amore global view and understanding of computing.andP;  This awareness, and theactivities that accompany such a new vision, will develop only through acoordinated, persistent, and long term effort among the professionalassociations, and government and private agencies.andM;It will be incumbent upon all ACM leaders, including the next ExecutiveCommittee, to ensure the participation in this endeavor of the broadestspectrum of computing professionals, and to forge new working relationshipswith other organizations having similar concerns and interests.andM;There is very little that the ACM leaders can do without yourinvolvement-without all of us working together toward some common goals.andO;What can be accomplished will be solely a factor of how effectively we canharness the energies and talents of the ACM staff, our members, and ourcolleagues.andM;For Secretary (for two years)andM;Susan J.

 He has been an AssociateEditor of the ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, the IEEETransactions on Software Engineering, and Acta Informatica.andP;  He has served onthe SIGPLAN Executive Committee, has chaired IFIP Working Group 2.4, and is amember of the Air Force Science Advisory Board and the Board of Visitors ofthe Software Engineering Institute.andP;  He is the author of over 70 papers andtechnical reports, has written three books, and has supervised over 20 Ph.D.andO;theses.andM;StatementandM;I am running for Council for three reasons.andP;  First, as a member of ACM since1961, 1 am committed to rebuilding it as a premiere professional society.andP;  Wecan only do that by setting crisp priorities and tough management.andP;  Paramountamong the priorities must be excellent services and fiscal responsibility.andO;The highest priority services are the SIGs and publications; they must bemade unsurpassed in quality and fiscally sound.andM;Second, ACM has a responsibility to formulate and articulate its members'positions on subjects such as intellectual property, security and privacy,ethics, support of research, and education.andP;  Information processing hasprofound implications on each of these.andP;  We must insure that those settingpolicy and writing legislation have the best possible advice.andP;  My position inWashington has made me especially aware of the need for ACM to exerciseleadership, to utilize the enormous expertise of its membership, and toprovide that advice.andM;Third, ACM needs to squarely and aggressively address education and humanresources.andP;  The relative participation of women and minorities in ourdiscipline has not changed in 20 years; that is unacceptable.andM;Bertram HerzogandM;Director Research Systems andamp; Center For information Technology integrationUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MIandM;BiographyandM;Dr.andP;  Herzog has held executive and professional positions in industrialcompanies, been co-founder of a software company, directed a universitycomputing center and research projects, and taught engineering and computerscience at several universities.andP;  Now he directs the University of Michigan'sResearch Systems Group and the Center For Information Technology Integration.andM;His consulting has involved technical advice for graphics systems, generalengineering computing services using workstations, personal, mini and supercomputers.andP;  He has also provided policy advice, advanced planning andbudgeting counsel.andM;Dr.andP;  Herzog's professional career began, upon graduation from Case WesternReserve University, as a structural engineer.andP;  He completed graduate studiesin Engineering Mechanics, MS (CWRU 55) and Ph.D.andP;  (UM 61).andP;  In 1953 he usedanalog, and then digital computers, for mechanics and vehicle simulation.andP;  inthe early sixties he introduced computer graphics technology for mechanicaldesign at Ford Motor Company.andP;  He taught computer graphics courses at theUniversity of Michigan and offered the same material to practicing engineers.andO;An early interest in distributed computing led to his appointment as thefirst director of the State Wide Merit Computer Network.andP;  He serves on theeditorial board of Computers and Graphics, and of IEEE's Computer Graphicsand Applications and was a co-editor of two Auerbach publications.andP;  He servedon the board of directors of several companies.andM;Herzog has been an ACM lecturer, chapter chair and regional representative.andO;Now he is EAB chair and SIGGRAPH Awards chair.andP;  He served as co-chair of theSIGGRAPH Core Graphics Standards Planning Committee and as a member of theANSI Graphics Standard Committee and chaired the X3D Extension Group of XWindows.andM;StatementandM;The association's principal role is to serve its membership-via technicalpublications, the SIGS, programming contests, etc.andP;  ACM brings information toits members about professional practices and responsibilities, ethical issuesand practices, intellectual property rights issues, concerns about risksassociated with our technology, and scientific freedom and human rights.andO;These areas, as well as awards and standards, are the assigned province ofthe External Activities Board which I chair.andP;  During the last 18 months theEAB, complementing ACM's excellent technical activities, has achieved greatervitality.andM;We need to do more to involve ACM members in public and professional issues.andO;Avenues already being proposed to increase public awareness must beemphasized so that ACM will serve its members and society in general.andP;  Incouncil I will devote special attention to these matters but within thenecessary financial constraints.andP;  I stress my successful effort when ACM wasextracted from the disastrous financial involvement in the last days of NCC.andO;On Council I will continue to serve ACM well during these critical andchanging times.andM;For Regional Representatives (one to be elected by Members in each Region forone year)andM;North Central Regional RepsandM;Ronald E.

This got her started on collectingand exhibiting the artifacts relating to the history of computing.andP;  By 1980,she saw the need for a true computer museum to celebrate the history ofcomputing.andP;  In 1981, she prepared the application for non-profit status,given to the Museum in 1982.andP;  She moved the Museum to downtown Boston andopened in a 42,000 square foot facility in 1984.andP;  She raised $3.3 million incapital and grew the operating budget from $30,000 to $1 million per year andachieved a unique joint collecting agreement with The SmithsonianInstitution's National Museum of American History.andM;In 1987, she moved from being Director to Founding President, serving on theBoard of Directors, carrying out special projects, being in charge ofcollections, and having time for other activities.andP;  She was on the ACM 1989SIGGRAPH Conference Committee, and has spoken on computer history at severalACM conferences.andM;StatementandM;I have the dirt! On all the old artifacts that make up the history ofcomputing.andP;  To get this I have had to balance various interests: those ofprofessionals in computing versus the public who are concerned with negativeand positive aspects of powerful new tool; those of the nonprofit institutionversus the profit-making companies that create the wealth of the computingindustry.andM;If elected, I will bring this perspective to the ACM, trying to make thesociety more meaningful to the professionals, to the industry, and to thewider public, while helping build a team that operates an effectiveAssociation for the membership.andM;I would work to make many strategic alliances bridging to a larger public, tonew generations of students, and to the institutional, governmental andcorporate structures that affect computing.andP;  The ACM must be innovative inlooking toward the future, developing strong working relationships with ournational academies and associations.andP;  At the same time, the ACM must helpmaintain an accurate record of the past, with a continuity and consistencyimpossible in any corporate or private archive.andM;As a Regional Representative I will work to build membership, and developprojects that will lead to a future that is probably different than any of uscan now imagine.andP;  aandM;For Regional Representatives (one to be elected by Members in each Region forone year) IandM;Pacific Regional RepsandM;Richard B.

 Even the ACM is not immuneto this threat, as the 1989 annual report reveals; there has been essentiallyno growth in ACM during the last five years, despite explosive growth in thefield.andM;To move ACM forward we must do three things:andM;Locally, we must promote more activity.andP;  This locality can be geographical(as with Chapters) or technical (as with SIGs), but we must directly tap theenergies of individuals and subgroups.andP;  We need to be more creative inorganizing groups and supporting their activities.andM;Globally, we must have leadership and strategic planning by the nationalorganization.andP;  I promise my best efforts to ensure that ACM stays focused onthe top level issues.andM;Finally, we must reach out for new members.andP;  ACM can play a leading role onlyif computing professionals choose to belong to the organization.andM;These goals invite us to expand our vision of ACM and to think about theopportunities and responsibilities of our profession.andP;
