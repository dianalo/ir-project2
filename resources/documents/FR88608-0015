The Guidelines described the circumstances underwhich market extension proposals might be subject to intensive examinationby the Board or the relevant Federal Reserve Bank before a determinationis made regarding competitive effects. Because of the current competitivesituation in the financial services industry, the Board has decided notto adopt the Guidelines.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>June 2, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>J.

Since the Guidelines were proposed, there have been significant changesin the financial services industry that have affected the usefulness ofthe Guidelines as a screen to determine those cases that raise probablefuture competition issues. Since 1980, for example, the powers of thriftinstitutions have been expanded greatly, and thrifts have increasinglytaken advantage of these powers to broaden the range and amount of theirservices. In addition, during this same period, there has been a markedbroadening of geographic expansion opportunities through relaxation ofstate branching and multi-bank holding company restrictions and interstatebanking initiatives. The Board's experience under the Guidelines has beenthat the combination of these two developments has affected the applicationof the criteria of the probable future competition doctrine in such a mannerthat it would be applicable, if at all, in only a very few banking markets.Although the Board has decided not to adopt the Guidelines, the Board willexamine mergers and acquisitions under the probable future competitiondoctrine in appropriate cases using the standards enunciated by the courts.In addition, the Department of Justice Merger Guidelines provide guidancefor analyzing market extension mergers. 49 FR 26823 (1984). Accordingly, in light of the above, the proposed policy on Market ExtensionGuidelines is withdrawn, effective June 2, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="6">William W.
