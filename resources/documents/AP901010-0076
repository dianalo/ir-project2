The 1,200 artifacts, which were nearly inaccessible toWesterners for decades, have come home to central Italy, where theEtruscan culture flourished until the 1st century B.C.   The exhibit is being hailed as a chance for scholars and thepublic to rediscover Etruscan masterpieces hidden away for decades.   It also is seen as a sign of exciting times to come in the artworld, as the new democracies of Eastern Europe begin to exchangeexhibits with countries that were ideological foes.   ``This brings together an extraordinary number of masterpiecesthat were very little known,'' said Massimo Pallottino, presidentof the National Institute of Italian Etruscan Studies.   ``It's something of exceptional importance.''   The exhibit in a Gothic castle in Viterbo, 50 miles north ofRome, was organized by the State Museums of Berlin.   It includes Etruscan artifacts from 26 museums in Poland,Hungary, Czechoslovakia and the former East Germany, as well as theSoviet Union.   The Etruscans were a powerful empire that dominated Italy beforesuccumbing to the Roman Empire. They were known for commercialflair, an elaborate religion and a brilliant artisan tradition,which included the finest goldwork in ancient Europe.   The Viterbo show brings together a wide range of Etruscanartifacts, ranging from a simple ceramic urn shaped like a housedating from the 9th century B.C., to elaborately carved sarcophagifrom the 2nd and 3rd centuries B.C.   The highlights include the contents of an 8th century B.C. tombof a man known as the Warrior of Tarquinia. Among the 104 piecesare engraved bronze shields, weapons, bracelets, rings and even arazor for the afterlife.   Another rare item is the ``Tile of Capua,'' a 5th-century B.C.plaque with writing believed to be part of a funeral ritual. It isthe second-longest existing piece of Etruscan writing, whichscientists have never succeeded in translating.   Several carved stone and alabaster sarcophagi with scenes ofbattles or the trip to the afterlife illustrate the Etruscans'talent for sculpture. On top of a few lies a likeness of the deadperson, often propped up on one elbow as if to enjoy a goodEtruscan meal.   Also in the exhibit is gold jewelry, including tiny earringsetched to resemble shields or bunches of grapes from the 3rd to 5thcenturies B.C.   Many Etruscan treasures wound up in German and Russian hands inthe 19th century, before Italy passed a law limiting exports.Germans, in particular, did much of the early research on theEtruscans and were interested in acquiring the pieces.   Many of the items in the exhibit were difficult for Westernersto see during Communist rule in Eastern Europe, due to thedifficulty of obtaining tourist visas.   ``Even some of our experts hadn't seen them,'' said Carlo MariaCardoni, director of the exhibit.   For the Italian organizers, the novelty of having treasures fromEastern European museums was matched by the novelty of working withmuseum officials trained under communism.   ``Their architect still goes around with a wooden ruler and apencil,'' said Cardoni, shaking his head. ``Let him see a computerthat in 35 minutes lays out the show, and it's like hitting him inthe head with a hammer.''   The Germans were also uneasy about the idea of making avideocassette of the exhibit, Cardoni said. ``I just went aheadwith it anyway,'' he shrugged.   The show, which closes Sunday, has toured Eastern Europe and theSoviet Union and may eventually go to France or Japan, Cardonisaid.   Art experts say the show is an example of the revolution that isoccurring in cultural exchanges now that Communist governments havefallen or become more moderate.   ``As curators and scholars, there's always been an internationalinterest in sharing the cultural wealth of one nation withanother,'' said Jillian Slonim, public information director of theNew York-based American Federation of Arts.   ``On the practical level, the circumstances have radicallychanged in the last short while, along with the changes in thegovernments.''</TEXT></DOC>
