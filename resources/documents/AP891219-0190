The rules imposed by the Office of Thrift Supervision providethat a name and address may be given out only if the customer isfirst notified and does not object within 15 days. After two years,the customer must be asked to renew the permission.   The prohibition took effect Friday.   The Association of Thrift Holding Companies, in a suit filed inU.S. District Court seeking to overturn the regulations, complainedthat the rules make it difficult for thrift parent companies, suchas insurance companies and banks, to cross-market their products tothe thrift's customers.   Banks do not operate under similar restrictions and imposing thelimits on Sandamp;Ls likely will hurt the government's efforts to disposeof failed thrifts, the trade group said. Financial institutionsearn money by selling their mailing lists to others.   However, thrift office director M. Danny Wall said in astatement the regulation ``strikes a reasonable balance betweencustomers' expectations of privacy and legitimate businessinterests of thrift institutions.''   He acknowledged that in most states the rules will now betougher for Sandamp;Ls than for banks, but said, ``We think that's apositive step, and gives the public an incentive to place theirbusiness with thrifts.''   The regulation has exemptions allowing customer information tobe disclosed to regulatory officials, law enforcement officials andcredit-reporting agencies.</TEXT></DOC>
