The Municipal Court jurors, who deliberated for four days,indicated after delivering their verdicts that they had acceptedRandall Terry's ``necessity defense'' in spite of the judge's rulingto the contrary. Terry and his codefendants have claimed laws can bebroken to prevent a greater harm.   ``We felt they stood up for their rights. We didn't feel theybroke the law,'' said juror Mike Simons of west Los Angeles.   The jury found Terry, who represented himself at the trial, andthe other activists innocent of five misdemeanor charges thatincluded trespassing, resisting arrest and criminal conspiracy.   The jurors, however, deadlocked 8-4 for conviction on conspiracycounts against Terry, 30, of Binghamton, N.Y., Michael McMonagle,36, of Philadelphia and Jeff White, 31, of Santa Cruz.   Judge Richard Paez declared a mistrial on the three counts,meaning they could be refiled by the City Attorney's office.Prosecutors said a decision on refiling the charges would be made byOct. 2.   Paez had said earlier the issue at trial was not abortion buttrespassing, and ruled the ``necessity defense'' did not applybecause abortion is legal. Defendants' motives for their actionswere not legitimate defenses in the case, he said.   The judge had scolded Terry and the other defendants forrepeatedly drawing the jury's attention to their opposition to legalabortions.   The five were on trial for allegedly ignoring a federalinjunction barring activists to block entrances to abortion clinics.Terry denied he was ever served a copy of the court order.   Also on trial were Don Bennette, 36, of Mission Viejo, and AndrewEppink, 41, of Palmdale.   Juror Edmond Bleavins said he hoped the verdict would send amessage to the Los Angeles Police Department. ``The police justbrutalized these people in my opinion,'' he said.   Bleavins said he did not intend to give Operation Rescue themessage they could ``keep on doing what they've been doing.'' Hesaid the jury deadlocked on conspiracy to block the entrance toclinics was because at least one juror felt the defendants' intentwas not to break the law but to save babies.   Only one of the defendants, White, was present for the verdicts.Defendants are not required to be present for all phases ofmisdemeanor trials.   ``Thank God. I think it's wonderful that a jury of our peers hassaid it's not against the law to save babies in L.A.,'' White said.   He said the jury appeared to have accepted defense claims thatthe Los Angeles Police Department used excessive force and believed``The issue of our intent _ we were there to save lives.''   Asked if the abortion issue came up during deliberations, jurorMarilyn McNichols of Downey answered: ``I wouldn't say it didn'tcome up but I would honestly say it was not a factor in arriving atour decision.''   Deputy City Attorney Lara Bloomquist, leaving the courthouse,said the defendants had succeeded in turning the abortion issue intotheir defense.   She said the compression of television screens jurors viewedduring the trial made the police tactics appear more violent thanthey were.   The charges were lodged after Operation Rescue activists blockedthe doors to a women's clinic on March 25, during a week of protestsin which more than 1,000 anti-abortion activists were arrestedthroughout California.   The protests were held as the U.S. Supreme Court considered aMissouri law, later upheld, which broadened the role of states inmaking laws about when a woman can have an abortion.   During the trial, Terry frequently referred to abortion clinicsas ``aboratorium,'' ``killing centers'' and ``abortion mills,''prompting Paez to rebuke him for using ``inflammatory'' language.</TEXT></DOC>
