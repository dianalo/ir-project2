The grand jury in Jackson charged Philip Shunk and LindaShunk with conspiring to misapply the bank's funds, withthree counts of making false bank entries, and with one countof converting one share of Country Club of Jackson stock heldby the bank to their own use. Mr. Strunk was charged withseven additional counts of making false entries in bankreports.</LP><TEXT>   If convicted of all charges, Mr. Shunk faces a maximumpenalty of 65 years in prison and a $3 million fine. Mrs.Shunk faces up to 30 years in prison and a $1.25 millionfine.   Mr. Shunk was president of the federally chartered thriftfrom October 1985 until December 1987, when he resigned. Hewas succeeded by his wife, who had been executive vicepresident. She remained president until she was removed byfederal regulators when they took control of Republic in July1988.   News of the indictment came as the House overwhelminglyapproved $75 million in fiscal 1991 appropriations forJustice Department prosecutions and civil proceedings relatedto financial institutions. That represents more than a 50%increase above the current spending. The money was added to apending bill that would provide $10.5 billion for theJustice, State, and Commerce Departments for the new budgetyear, which begins Oct. 1.   Separately, the Justice Department said that the 93 U.S.attorneys have been called to Washington for a meetingtomorrow with Attorney General Dick Thornburgh concerningprosecution of savings and loan fraud cases. The departmentsaid President Bush will speak to the prosecutors.   Yesterday, a private government watchdog group accused theBush administration of tardy and weak prosecution of Sandamp;Lfraud. Federal prosecutions have recouped less than 1% oftaxpayers' losses that are attributable to fraud, collectingless than $100 million in restitution and fines, according toPublic Citizen, a Ralph Nader-backed group.   &quot;Our study leads to an inescapable, disturbing conclusion:The Bush administration's efforts to pursue and punish Sandamp;Lfraud have been anemic at best,&quot; said Sherry Ettleson ofPublic Citizen.   Such comments, and the lopsided 420-1 House vote toincrease government funds for cracking down on financialwrongdoers, reflect the increasing political volatility ofthe Sandamp;L issue. But President Bush, speaking at a newsconference during a speaking trip to Alabama, declined torepeat this week's White House assertions that Democrats areto blame for much of the Sandamp;L mess and subsequent bailout. Mr.Bush said he doesn't want to &quot;be out there saying here'swho's to blame and here's who's not to blame.&quot;   Mr. Bush, sounding a theme his administration intends torepeat more and more to deflect its handling of the crisis,promised &quot;plenty more&quot; prosecutions of thrift officials whoviolated laws. Mr. Bush said he met with Mr. Thornburgh thisweek to discuss the cases being brought and said hisadministration will &quot;put those that are guilty into the dockwhere they belong and see that they are brought toresponsibility for what they've done.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
