Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the $300 billion defenseauthorization bill passed by Congress ``restores the defensespending priorities requested'' by Reagan in a message accompanyingthe president's veto of an earlier version on Aug. 3.   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci earlier had givencongressional figures assurances that Reagan would sign therevamped authorization bill, and Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman ofthe Senate Armed Services Committee, told his colleagues, ``Thisbill will be signed.''   The assurances were conveyed by Carlucci during a week ofclosed-door talks with Nunn and other legislators, according toNunn.   ``The president will approve this bill. That was made very clearand definite,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the HouseArmed Services Committee.   Fitzwater said the bill ``eliminates the major objections to theoriginal bill. We consider this bill a significant victory for thepresident's commitment to a strong defense.''   The House voted 369-48 approval of the revised measure Wednesdayafternoon. Three hours later, the Senate passed it, 91-4.   Overall, the measure authorizes the Pentagon to spend $300billion in the fiscal year beginning Saturday, the same total aswas contained in the bill Reagan vetoed Aug. 3. That represents aslight cut from this year's $301 billion defense budget.   While the new measure contains the same reductions in Reagan'sproposed Star Wars budget as the original legislation, the earlierbill's congressionally mandated restrictions on internal spendingin the Star Wars program were removed.   The Strategic Defense Initiative, as the Star Wars anti-missileresearch program is formally known, would receive $4.1 billion inthe bill, compared to the $4.8 billion sought by Reagan and the$3.9 billion authorized for this year.   The Pentagon wanted to spend up to $330 million of the SDI moneyon a space-based interceptor weapon, the first stage of an earlydeployment SDI program. The previous Pentagon bill would haverestricted that to only $85 million, but the new measure removesthat limit.   The new bill also removes a restriction on flight testing of``depressed trajectory'' missiles, which fly relatively low insteadof into space as do other long-range atomic weapons. The UnitedStates has none of the weapons under development and no plans fortesting, but the Soviets are believed to be developing the weapons.   Money to pay for the programs authorized in the bill is part ofa separate Pentagon appropriation bill.   The measures are the major unfinished items on the congressionalagenda as legislators try to wind up their work and quit for theyear.   The new Pentagon bill also rewrote the complicated spending planfor the MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles, two weapons at the heartof a dispute over the future of America's land-based nuclearmissile force.   The original bill proposed spending $250 million each for studyof Midgetman and a railroad-based version of the MX and providedanother $250 million to be used for either program next year by theincoming president.   The new bill provides $250 million for Midgetman and $600million for the MX-on-rails program, but says no more than $250million of the MX money can be spent before Feb. 15. The remaining$350 million could be reallocated by whomever wins the presidencyNov. 8.   The bill also includes a 4.1 percent pay raise for the nation's2.1 million uniformed military personnel.
