After being pummeled in recent weeks by political scandals and setbacks, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's ruling Congress (I) Party leaders met one Saturday last month to assess damage and pin blame. The party's Working Committee concluded that India has been subjected to a &quot;grand design of destabilization&quot; perpetrated primarily by Pakistan, the U.S. and multinational corporations.    Since then, various party officials, including Mr. Gandhi, have delivered tirades against the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, Western media and Pakistani agents. In the lingo of Indian newspeak, the country once more is in the grip of the &quot;foreign hand.&quot;    Conspiracy theories are nothing new here. Former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi saw the foreign hand behind just about anything that went wrong with the country. She once blamed the CIA for the absence of an expected monsoon.    But the recent spate of anti-Western rhetoric is something new for her son, who came to power 2 1/2 years ago. So far, there isn't any indication this is more than political bombast.    Some businessmen and political analysts dismiss the resurrection of the foreign-hand shibboleth as an attempt to bolster sagging domestic popularity and deflect criticism of government miscues.    &quot;At times of political distress, you go back to the past,&quot; says Bhabani Sen Gupta, a specialist in political science with the New Delhi-based Center for Policy Research. &quot;But it isn't taken seriously by most people in the country, even among leftist forces.&quot; Adds a Western diplomat: &quot;It's a reversion to the claptrap of the pre-Rajiv era.&quot;    Nevertheless, the cries of &quot;foreign hand&quot; are taken seriously enough for their validity to be debated by the Indian press. Says one political analyst: &quot;You just can't dismiss this as a joke.&quot;    A few analysts and the country's opposition warn that a sustained dose of such rhetoric could lead to a shift in Mr. Gandhi's pragmatic approach to both foreign policy and the economy. &quot;We are now in the sloganeering phase,&quot; says opposition leader Jaswant Singh. &quot;But governments become captives of their own rhetoric, and as much as style influences substance, rhetoric will influence government policies.&quot;    Whatever importance they may attach to the development, many analysts agree the reappearance of the foreign hand is yet another indication of Mr. Gandhi's growing penchant for saying -- and doing -- whatever he believes to be politically expedient, no matter how contradictory this may be.    In recent weeks, he has called for more foreign investment and approved his party's condemnation of those same foreign investors. He has derided his administration for being sycophantic, but earlier this year he fired a high-ranking civil servant, Foreign Secretary A.P. Venkateswaran, who tended to be outspoken. He sidelined cabinet member Vishwanath Pratap Singh, shifting his portfolio from finance to defense (a post he eventually resigned). Mr. Singh, who isn't related to the opposition leader, had been vigorously pursuing Mr. Gandhi's own policies when they ran afoul of the country's entrenched business community.    Mr. Gandhi recently chastised labor for being uncompetitive. Yet he has refused to close Scooters India Ltd., a hopelessly bankrupt and labor-bloated public-sector company.    Analysts say these twists and turns demonstrate Mr. Gandhi's inability to set and see through policy. As the Indian Express's executive editor, Arun Shourie, recently wrote, the prime minister is &quot;addicted to the convenience of the moment.&quot;    Lacking a clear direction and a stable administrative hierarchy, already slow-moving bureaucrats are becoming even more cautious and inclined to pass the buck. Says an exasperated former Industries Ministry official: &quot;We spend all our time formulating policy, but ultimately it's a case-by-case system.&quot;    The muddle is reflected in foreign policy. Sri Lankan Tamil militants complained they were shunted recently from one Indian official to another for secret talks because no one appeared to have the authority to take charge.    The conspiracy rhetoric coincides with a deterioration in India's relations with its longtime adversary Pakistan and with the U.S. Late last month, the current defense minister, Krishna Chandra Pant, told Parliament that India is rethinking its nuclear-weapons policy in light of further evidence that Pakistan has the capability of manufacturing a nuclear bomb. (India detonated a nuclear device in 1974 but has since refrained from testing.)    Indian officials have warned that ties with the U.S. would be severely strained if the American Congress, as expected, approves a $4 billion package of military and economic aid for Pakistan and supplies that country with airborne warning-and-control system aircraft known as Awacs. In addition, a U.S. legislator proposed that aid to India be slashed to $35 million from $50 million as punishment for the country's voting record in the United Nations and its ties to the Soviet Union.    Foreign-hand theorists had a field day with the two U.S. aid packages. Talk of a conspiracy showed up in a parliamentary debate last month on the Finance Ministry's use of a U.S. detective agency to investigate illegal funds abroad.    And last Saturday, in some of his toughest language yet, Mr. Gandhi took the U.S. to task for its assistance to Pakistan. &quot;The big powers are talking to us about morality,&quot; he told a New Delhi rally. &quot;They ask us to sign the non-proliferation treaty while our neighbor is being armed with Awacs and $4 billion in aid.&quot;    The conspiracy debate became a forum for an orchestrated campaign by Mr. Gandhi's advisers to discredit then-Defense Minister Singh. Some Congress (I) members with no apparent knowledge of the detective agency were speaking of it as having known CIA links and of the ministry's probe as a vehicle for a CIA disinformation campaign.    Within two weeks, the government faced two further crises. The highly popular and respected Mr. Singh resigned three days after ordering an investigation into possible illegal kickbacks in the purchase of West German submarines. He was condemned by his own party for the action.    A Swedish radio report subsequently alleged that Indian officials had been paid secret commissions of $5 million by Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors, which sold India $1.3 billion of artillery. In the debate that followed, the foreign hand played a prominent role.    One Congress (I) stalwart insisted that the recent crises were part of a &quot;world conspiracy&quot; to get the party. Multinationals, said S.K. Mehta, were upset because Mr. Gandhi had thwarted their plans to capture India's economy. The &quot;imperialists&quot; were angered because Mr. Gandhi had become the international leader of the nonaligned movement and an opponent of South African apartheid.    But in Parliament, Mr. Mehta's tirade provoked as much laughter as alarm. &quot;Blaming multinationals for political problems is absurd,&quot; says a New Delhi-based foreign businessman.    And many outside Parliament continue to scoff at the notion of a conspiracy beyond the ruling party's own propensity for repeatedly shooting itself in the foot. </TEXT></DOC>
