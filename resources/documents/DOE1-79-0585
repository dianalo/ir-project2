<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-79-0585 </DOCNO><TEXT>Calculated 2{nu} rates have long overestimated those determined from geochemicalmeasurements. Recent work has uncovered a mechanism that, within thequasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA), suppresses the calculated2{nu} rates to achieve closer agreement with experiment. We show thatthe same mechanism also suppresses 0{nu} rates; one obvious implicationis that limits on the neutrino mass from double-beta decay experimentsare probably not as stringent as previously estimated.
