Anderson and educator Thomas Sutherland.   The typewritten Arabic statement was delivered to theindependent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar hours after the attack. Anauthenticating color picture of Anderson was delivered to theReuters news agency with a copy of the statement, but it was thesame photograph the group released of Anderson in April.   The statement praised the Shiite Moslem suicide car bomber whokilled seven Israeli soldiers and wounded eight soldiers and twoLebanese women in Israel's self-declared security zone in southLebanon on Wednesday. That attack prompted Israel's retaliatory airstrike, which killed 15 people and wounded 35 in south Lebanon onFriday.   The instant photo showed Anderson, 40, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, wearing a Commodore HotelT-shirt and a bushy beard and mustache. He looked straight into thecamera without his glasses.   It was the 11th picture released of Lebanon's longest-heldforeign captive, abducted in Moslem west Beirut March 16, 1985.   It was the same photograph released of Anderson on April 10,when Islamic Jihad threatened to harm the hostages if a Kuwaitijetliner hijacked to Larnaca, Cyprus was stormed to free thepassengers.   The 29-line statement began with several verses from the Koran,Islam's holy book, and deplored Israel's air attack as a``challenge to the will of our oppressed people.''   It accused the U.S. administration of giving Israel advanceapproval to attack Palestinian and Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon.The pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, had claimedresponsibility for the suicide bombing.   ``The criminal America must realize it will not get away withwhat it has done, especially in connection with the hostages wehold, so that will be a lesson to whoever strikes at the dignityand glory of our people and mujahedeen (holy fighters),'' it said.   Sheik Fadlallah, considered to be Hezbollah's spiritual leader,said he would do his best to protect the hostages.   ``We continue to respect our previous commitments to defendhuman rights in order to see these hostages free and safe as soonas possible,'' he said. ``We will do our utmost to see that nothinghappens to any of them.''   He spoke in Beirut with Ray Barnett, a Canadian representativeof Ambassadors of Aid, a group that helps orphans in Third Worldcountries.   In Cadiz, Ky., Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, issued a statementasking his captors to ``recognize that Terry Anderson is totallyinnocent and has never been involved in the continuing Middle Eaststrife except as a captive for 3{ years.''   ``It is totally unjust to hold him responsible for the militaryactions of another country,'' Mrs. Say said.   Friday's statement was the first since Aug. 18, when the groupsaid none of its hostages would be released soon.   Sutherland, 56, of Fort Collins, Colo., was acting dean ofagriculture at the American University of Beirut when he wasabducted June 9, 1985.   Anderson and Sutherland are among nine Americans believed heldby pro-Iranian extremist factions linked to Hezbollah. Others heldare three Britons, an Irishman and an Italian.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman calledfor an end to violence between Israel and Lebanon and urged thekidnappers to free their hostages.   Asked about the Islamic Jihad warning, he said: ``These areinnocent victims. They are being held through no fault of theirown.... And the appeal to the hostage-holders has to be always,`Release these innocent people.'''   In a separate development Friday, the weekly Beirut magazineAsh-Shiraa said the United States and Iran were working out a newdeal to free the American hostages before the U.S. presidentialelection on Nov. 8.   Ash-Shiraa said the deal would ensure the victory of VicePresident George Bush in exchange for a commitment from theRepublican candidate to rearm Iran.   There was no way to verify the report. The United States hasstressed that it has no contacts with Iran.   Ash-Shiraa, which has access to Iranian hardliners, gainedinternational fame in Nov. 1986 when it broke the story of the U.S.secret arms sales to Iran. But most of its subsequent reports aboutthe hostages have been inaccurate.   Other reports have said both Bush and Democratic candidateMichael Dukakis sent envoys to work out a deal with the Iranians onthe hostages. Both candidates denied the reports.</TEXT></DOC>
