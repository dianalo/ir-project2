The criminal investigation didn't result in any charges against Adm. Thomas Hayward, who stepped down as chief of naval operations in July 1982, according to law enforcement officials and the admiral's attorney. The case was closed largely because prosecutors didn't find any evidence of improper payments or gifts to the Navy's Pacific Fleet officers who supplied Adm. Hayward with information, law enforcement officials said.    But now, Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci's office is considering whether to revoke Adm. Hayward's security clearance because of those consulting activities, according to law enforcement officials and the admiral's lawyer, Merlin Staring.    Adm. Hayward's case, which has escaped public notice since it started in 1985, isn't part of the current nationwide investigation of Pentagon corruption and bid-rigging. But it has some important parallels to that inquiry, and indicates earlier concerns by naval and Justice Department officials about suspected influence-peddling by current and former Pentagon officials.    The earlier inquiry focused on some of the thorny legal and ethical questions that are at the heart of the current investigation: how consultants manage to obtain closely held information from the military, and how far they legitimately can go to benefit their clients.    The 64-year-old admiral, who runs his own consulting firm, Thomas B. Hayward Associates Inc., in Honolulu, initially sent word through his attorney to set up an interview, but later declined. The admiral feels that it is &quot;water over the dam&quot; and that any publicity could damage his &quot;credibility,&quot; the attorney said Friday.    However, in an earlier interview, Mr. Staring acknowledged that Adm. Hayward had &quot;a number of ongoing consulting relationships with U.S. firms&quot; during the period covered by the investigation, although the attorney declined to identify specific clients.    The materials Adm. Hayward passed on to contractors, according to his attorney and law-enforcement officials, included Defense Department estimates and projections of the South Korean navy's shipbuilding plans. Some of Adm. Hayward's clients hoped to obtain Korean contracts, and he is said to have urged U.S. Navy officers to supply information that would help American contractors compete more effectively with foreign companies for that business.    Mr. Staring acknowledged that in other instances, when Adm. Hayward obtained information from U.S. government or other sources about prospective foreign military contracts, &quot;he would routinely pass on that information&quot; to U.S. contractors. &quot;There genuinely was a patriotic element to this,&quot; Mr. Staring asserted.    Indeed, law enforcement officials said the prospect of such an argument, coupled with Adm. Hayward's assertions that some of the material he received shouldn't have been classified, also discouraged the government from seeking charges. In addition to the information about Korean shipbuilding, the investigation delved into certain other &quot;conflict-of-interest&quot; allegations involving the admiral after he retired, Mr. Staring said. He wouldn't be more specific.    Nevertheless, the Hayward investigation highlights the easy access former high-ranking military officers and appointees frequently retain to classified and proprietary information inside the Pentagon. And it shows that long before the current Pentagon procurement scandal erupted, federal prosecutors and agents of the Naval Investigative Service suspected that the swapping of information among consultants and Defense Department officials posed a significant problem.    The U.S. attorney in Honolulu, whose decision to close the case was supported by Justice Department headquarters, declined to comment.    The investigation of Adm. Hayward's consulting work, though, was only one of the early warnings suggesting more fundamental Pentagon procurement problems. In October 1987, for example, the same year that the Hayward case was closed, the head of the Naval Investigative Service prepared a report that should have set off alarm bells at the Pentagon.    The report, according to the General Accounting Office, recounted instances of &quot;conflict of interest and bribery&quot; involving Navy procurement programs, adding that several ongoing and recently closed investigations focused on &quot;high ranking Naval officers and high level Navy Department civilians.&quot;    Comptroller General Charles Bowsher, head of the GAO, told a House government operations subcommittee earlier this month that the report wasn't passed on to the Secretary of Defense because the problems it cited weren't considered a &quot;systemic weakness,&quot; and didn't refer to allegations that are part of the current nationwide investigation. </TEXT></DOC>
