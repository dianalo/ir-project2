(products).andO;Ticker:    LOTS.andO;Product:   Agenda (Personal information management system).andO;Topic:     Software packagesEvaluationData base management systems.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Inside AgendaandM;Henry Luce, a founder of Time magazine, was once described as a man who wouldopen a shoe store stocked with shoes in only his size, then wonder why hedidn't sell a pair to every person who looked in the shop window.andP;  That, in anutshell, is Agenda.andM;Officially, Lotus's newest product is called a &quot;personal informationmanager.&quot;andP;  More to the point, it's zealotware--software by and for zealots.andO;You'll either love Agenda or hate it, depending on whether you agree with thevision of the shapers of the program--and whether you've got an itch thatAgenda can scratch.andM;The three zealots who put their stamp on Agenda are Lotus founder MitchKapor, artificial intelligence expert Jerrold Kaplan, who was once Lotus'sprincipal technologist, and Edward Belove, Lotus's vice president ofcorporate research and development.andP;  They say Agenda was shaped by theirneeds, which they believe are similar to those of millions of PC usersdeluged with information overload.andP;  They see Agenda as a people and projecttracker, a decision-making tool, and an electronic notebook.andM;To describe their product, they coined the term personal informationmanager--a program that helps you collect, organize, and analyze the bits andpieces of information in your professional and private life: notes, to-dolists, phone numbers, appointments, ideas you get in the shower.andM;The value of a personal information manager is that it gives structure toyour information, infers priorities and finds relationships, and lets youview the information from different perspectives.andM;In addition to Agenda, two other recent programs have generated interest aspersonal information managers: GrandView, $295 from the Symantec Corporation,arguably the ultimate evolution of the thought outliner; and IZE, $445 fromPersoft, a colorful and quirky text retrieval program with some rudimentaryhypertext abilities.andM;What sets personal information managers--and Agenda in particular--apart istheir ability to perform information-gathering and analysis tasks that nocurrent category of software handles capably.andM;These are big jobs, the kind only a true believer would tackle.andP;  And whileAgenda's creators may be committed to their vision, Agenda requires somecommitment from its users, too.andP;  Lotus may disagree vehemently, but Agendasuffers from a huge learning curve.andP;  You can do interesting work after anhour or two at the electronic-notepad level, but to see a meaningfulproductivity boost, to really take advantage of the program's capabilities,you might have to invest 50 to 100 hours.andM;And you're practically required to make that investment as an act of faith:Agenda's reference manuals aren't particularly lucid, onscreen help is terse,and some of the program's procedures are unnecessarily arcane.andP;  At $395,Agenda is a bargain if you have serious work for the program to handle, butif you never have to analyze or juxtapose information, it's a bit pricey foran occasional notepad.andM;Still, some users find Agenda to be nothing short of a religious experience:it mesmerizes them.andP;  By the time it shipped in July, a dozen books on it werein the works, and a small army of add-in developers were building specializedapplications (see sidebar).andP;  Clearly, Agenda has converts already.andM;Most products billed as personal information managers fall into one of fourcategories: text retrieval programs (also called free-form databases),calendar/tracking/time-management software, outliners, and hypermedia orhypertext (plus, if you stretch the definition, desktop organizers).andP;  Agendamay be the hardest of all these products to pigeonhole.andP;  It has elementsdrawn from each of the four categories, but it's not really at home in anycamp.andM;Agenda is built around three concepts:andM;* items and notes (information)andM;* categories (how you and Agenda arrange the information)andM;* views (how you look at the information).andM;Agenda stores your information as &quot;items.&quot;andP;  Each item can be a note 350characters long--&quot;see Fred next Wednesday about his annual review&quot; or &quot;behome early Thursday for Jennifer's birthday party&quot;--and you can attach anadditional 10KB (five typed pages) of text, called a &quot;note,&quot; to each item.andO;Agenda is already in semantic trouble: because Lotus reserves the word &quot;note&quot;to define the 10KB attachment, it can't use &quot;note&quot; to describe the item.andO;Instead, it's stuck with awkward descriptions such as &quot;natural, free-formtext units.&quot;andM;As you add information to your Agenda database, you create structure andusefulness by assigning the items to categories (such as Tasks, People,Customers, Priority, Dates, and Departments).andP;  Typically, you assign thefirst items by hand; as the database grows, Agenda can take over and makecategory assignments automatically, based on your structure.andP;  Categories canhave subcategories (e.g., clients' names under Clients) that can be nested 12deep in a parent-and-child structure.andM;Agenda lets you examine your information from as many angles or slices as youcan conceive.andP;  Each angle is called a &quot;view.&quot;andP;  Think of each view as anon-the-fly query, or as the equivalent of a database report.andM;Each time you enter an item, Agenda scans, or parses, the item for matcheswith the category structure, using artificial intelligence techniques.andO;Agenda understands conversational dates automatically (&quot;beginning ofFebruary&quot; means 2/1/89).andM;Agenda can also be taught synonyms.andP;  For instance, if you're keeping acomputer company database, you could tell Agenda to assign anything with thephrases &quot;IBM,&quot; &quot;International Business Machines,&quot; or &quot;Big Blue&quot; to the IBMcategory.andP;  It understands that they all mean the same thing.andM;Further, using a form of if-then logic called &quot;oncditions and actions,&quot; youcould assign any item to the IBM category that includes phrases such as&quot;Micro Channel&quot; or &quot;PS/2.&quot;andP;  You can also assign negatively: for instance, youcan assign to IBM any item that contains the word &quot;PC&quot; but not the words&quot;Compaq,&quot; &quot;Tandy,&quot; or &quot;Zenith.&quot;andM;Agenda lets you control the strength of this category-matching.andP;  You canrequire a complete or partial match of a multiple-word phrase, turn offmatching altogether, or ask Agenda to query you with suggested matches whenit's unsure.andP;  You can change the category structure and assignments at anytime, from any place in the database, without losing information.andM;While this process of comparing, assigning, and categorizing is well withinthe ability of most human brains, this sort of intelligence is somewhat rarein software.andP;  Agenda does it far faster and doesn't complain if you changeyour mind and decide to develop a new structure in midstream.andM;Agenda displays information onscreen in a loose row-and-column format.andP;  Itemsalways appear one below another in one column of text.andP;  Items are groupedinto logical segments, or sections, based on your categories and assignments.andO;For instance, all your information about IBM might be in one section,everything about Compaq in another.andP;  Unless you make categories exclusive,the same item can appear in more than one section.andM;You can have additional columns onscreen, usually of categories related tothe items.andP;  For example, you might have a Company view, in which each sectionis devoted to one computer company.andP;  The additional columns might containcategories listing Priority (high, medium, or low importance), the Person youwant to alert about each item, and the Date each item was entered.andM;A second view or slice might be Priority, where the categories from thePriority column of the Company view become section headings (High, Medium,Low), and the former section headings (Company names) become a column calledCompany.andP;  A third slice might be Company (High Priority) withcompany-by-company sections, filtered to show only the items with prioritymarked High.andP;  Using &quot;accelerator keys&quot; (Alt-H, Alt-V), you can rapidly findthe same item in the context of different sections and views, or you canalternate between views.andM;This dynamic linking between categories gives Agenda some features ofhypertext or hypermedia, although it's hardly a full embodiment of theprinciples of hypertext suggested by computer pioneers Ted Nelson and DouglasEnglebart in the 1960s.andM;Agenda switches views rapidly with small databases, slows down with largerdatabases (more than 100KB of information), and gets positively sluggish ifyou approach its 4MB file limit.andP;  No matter how small the database, you'llfind Agenda slow and clunky on an 8088- or 8086-based PC.andP;  It's also a memorypig: it needs almost all 640KB of memory, and it doesn't support theLotus-Intel-Microsoft Expanded Memory Specification (LIM EMS), which allowsLotus 1-2-3 and some other programs to take advantage of memory beyond 640KBin your PC.andP;  That means you can't run a pop-up program in the background.andO;(An OS/2 version is in the works, Lotus says.)andM;Agenda really deserves an 80386- or a fast 80286-based machine.andP;  Ideally,you'll want a 386 equipped with a multitasking operating environment such asWindows/386 that lets you switch among several programs.andP;  Then you can useyour word processor or 1-2-3, have Agenda ready in the background, andquickly stick a note (sorry, item) into Agenda whenever an idea pops intoyour head.andM;You can type information into Agenda directly, import information using atranslation facility that structures it on the way in, import files directly(without translation, as notes), or reference external files as notes (whichavoids wasting disk space).andP;  Big companies may find the data import featureuseful for business information analysis tasks.andM;Two features save keystrokes: macros and automatic phrase completion.andP;  Therobust macro facility provides enough loops, branching, and conditions tosatisfy any hacker.andP;  Others will find the macros a help in automating routinetasks.andP;  With automatic phrase completion, as soon as you type enough of aphrase to identify it, Agenda beeps.andP;  After the beep, you tap the Enter key,and Agenda completes the phrase.andM;You can check off items as they are completed and tag items that depend onthe completion of other items.andP;  Completed or dependent items can be hidden,deleted, and moved into and out of categories.andM;Printer control is a throwback to the Dark Ages (name another major newprogram that forces you to embed &quot;\b\&quot; at the beginning and end of materialyou want to print boldface), and you can't get more than 80 charactersacross, even though most printers can print 132 or more.andP;  And unless youfancy yourself a programmer, you'll shake your head at the complexity of theprocedure to import files, particularly e-mail messages.andM;Lotus has inexplicably omitted three features that Agenda users would findimmediately useful: true calendaring, math, and a phone dialer.andP;  Why werethey left out?andP;  Even mighty Lotus may be guilty of defensive programming:that's when a company omits immensely useful features that might distract thepoor, dumb user from grasping the program's intended role in the softwareuniverse.andP;  Product designers do it all the time.andP;  Shame on every one of them.andM;Since Agenda already has a superb understanding of dates, it wouldn't haverequired much effort to add the ability to recognize time of day,automatically assign every item that includes the words &quot;meet,&quot; &quot;visit,&quot; or&quot;plan,&quot; to a view called Appointments, and sort the view in ascending orderby date and time.andM;Even though Lotus gives abundant examples of Agenda databases that containphone numbers, the program is missing an automatic phone dialer--somethingthat a Lotus programmer could create as easily as he could order out forpizza.andM;Agenda provides no easy method of categorizing or filtering by numbers.andP;  Youmight, for instance, want a view that groups items by cost ranges.andP;  It can bedone, if you're a masochist.andP;  One of Agenda's sample databases, a fictitiousNewport Beach, California, realty brokerage, shows how.andP;  In this example, yougroup houses with list prices between $1 million and $1.5 million by placingthis line in Agenda's &quot;category manager&quot;:andM;&quot;Reasonable&quot;;$1\,0*\,*;$1\,1*\,*; $1\,2*\,*;$1\,3*\,*; $1\,4*\,*andM;This phrase says, in effect: &quot;If you encounter a text string starting with adollar sign, a 1, a comma (the backslash tells Agenda to treat the nextcharacter, the comma, as a comma), the number 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, some morenumbers, another comma, and still more numbers, this item belongs in the'Reasonable' price category.&quot;andP;  (The example labels any house priced at lessthan a million dollars as &quot;Inexpensive.&quot;andP;  Agenda is apparently not targetedat the Peoria and Grand Rapids crowd.)andM;There must be some reason for Lotus's omissions.andP;  Perhaps a program with aphone dialer, an appointments calendar, and math capabilities might bemistaken for Borland's SideKick or some other desktop organizer.andP;  And Lotusalready has a pretty tough job in describing Agenda to the world.andP;  Witnessits advertisements for the product, which show a funnel, three ducks in arow, a revolving spice rack filled with exotic condiments, and a fireman'snet for jumpers: they're all attempts to portray order being created out ofchaos.andM;Describing Agenda: there's a job for a zealot.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
