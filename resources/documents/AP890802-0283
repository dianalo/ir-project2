Jacobs has made a roughly $2.85billion takeover proposal to Avon Products Inc., the latestunsolicited offer for the cosmetics company that has spurnedprevious suitors, Jacobs and Avon disclosed Wednesday.   James E. Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive, saidJacobs' request for a meeting to negotiate a possible purchase ofAvon _ the world's biggest direct sales company _ would be reviewedat the board's regular meeting on Thursday at Avon's New Yorkheadquarters.   In a brief news release, Preston said he sent a letter to Jacobsinforming him that in the past the board members have stressed thatAvon is not for sale.   Jacobs, who oversees his investment empire from Minneapolis,said in a telephone interview Wednesday that he's never been in abetter position to carry out an acquisition attempt and indicatedhe would be tenacious in his quest for Avon.   ``We've had the best year we've ever had,'' Jacobs said. ``Allthese things play a part. I have never been more serious about acommitment in my life.''   In three separate deals in the past year, Jacobs and investmentpartners reported making more than $164 million in profit.   Jacobs' $41-a-share offer for Avon is worth about $2.25 billionbased on 54.91 million shares of common stock outstanding. Jacobsalso said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commissionthat he contemplates redeeming Avon's preferred shares, which wouldcost $33.50 per share, or a total of about $603 million, raisingthe price tag on Avon to roughly $2.85 billion.   Avon also has about $1 billion in debt that would be part of anyacquisition.   Avon stock gained $1 to $36.50 a share in composite New YorkStock Exchange trading Wednesday.   The company has slammed the door on at least two suitors inrecent months.   In May, the Avon board rejected a hostile $39-a-share takeoverbid from rival direct selling company Amway Corp. and indicated atthe time that it would resist future acquisition attempts.   Only days after Avon turned down Amway, Mary Kay Corp., parentof the door-to-door makeup seller Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc.,disclosed its interest in acquiring Avon and also got a coldshoulder.   Although Amway withdrew its bid of about $2.1 billion, thecompany still has a stake in Avon.   Through a partnership with Jacobs, Amway has an interest inabout 10.3 percent of Avon's common stock outstanding. Jacobscontrols about 55 percent of the Avon stock owned by A-JPartnership, as the alliance of Amway and Jacobs is called.   The partnership didn't act jointly in making the initial bid forAvon and Jacobs said they are not acting together now.   If he prevails in his takeover attempt, Jacobs said, he wouldkeep Avon's core direct-selling business in the United States andretain a significant interest in the company's internationaldivision.   There are about 475,000 Avon sales representatives operating inthe United States and another 1 million selling Avon cosmetics,toiletries and jewelry in foreign markets. Avon, known in the pastfor the ad slogan ``Ding Dong, Avon Calling,'' is the world'sbiggest direct-sales company.   Jacobs said if he gets control of Avon he would sell Avon'sretail division, which consists of some of the country'sbest-selling perfumes sold at department store counters, includingGiorgio Beverly Hills and Red.   He also would finish divesting the health care businesses whichAvon has been selling.   The divestitures have been part of Avon's strategy to enhanceprofitability. In the second quarter, Avon earned $39.5 million onsales of $778 million compared with a loss of $82.5 million andsales of $704 million a year earlier.   Jacobs said he had no intention of selling any piece of Avon toAmway or to Mary Kay. He said he has not had any contact with Avonexecutives except a telephone call to acknowledge receipt of hisletter.   Jacobs wouldn't take a management position at Avon if he gainscontrol, he said. But he said he is familiar with the industry byvirtue of his ownership of Watkins Inc. of Winona, Minn. Jacobspurchased the health and beauty aids company out of bankruptcy in1977.   Jacobs said he has hired an investment banking arm of Citicorpto help him arrange financing for the all-cash offer for Avon.</TEXT></DOC>
