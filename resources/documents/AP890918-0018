Secondly, says Louis E. Swanson in Resources Quarterly, there isa false assumption that with the possible exception of farmers,rural people are doing well.   At least five factors have impaired rural policy development inCongress and the federal bureaucracy, he said. These include:   _An unrealistic, often romantic view of a bucolic rural economyand society.   _Serious limitations to existing social and economic data onsparsely populated areas.   _The treatment of rural America as a geographical entityunconnected to the larger U.S. economy and society.   _A perception that many rural areas do not have viable politicalsolutions.   _The absence of a unified rural constituency and the presence ofa formidable opposition to renovated and new rural developmentprograms.   A report by an Agriculture Department task force earlier thisyear said the rural economy ``has difficulty keeping pace withnational economic growth'' because of the small size of communities,isolation, unskilled labor and a lack of institutional support.   The task force's recommendations, which are still under review byUSDA, said the department should begin by ``committing itself torural development'' as a major mission and should articulate cleargoals.   One of Swanson's criticisms was that USDA and the network ofland-grant universities have been ``relatively passive opponents''of rural development for many years.   ``Their opposition has taken the form of neglect,'' he said.``They define their mission as primarily to assist commercialagriculture, and in so doing believe they help all rural people.''   Swanson is an associate professor of sociology at the Universityof Kentucky and was a resident fellow in the national center forfood and agricultural policy at Resources for the Future, anon-profit independent organization that conducts research on thedevelopment, conservation and use of natural resources and theenvironment.   In his report, Swanson said that rural America long ago shed itsoverwhelming dependency on farming.   For example, he noted, in 1984 most rural employment nationallywas accounted for by: manufacturing, 40 percent; services and trade,16.5 percent; government, 13 percent; farming, 9 percent; andmining, about 5.5 percent.   ``Moreover, for the same year, farm families reported that morethan 60 percent of their net family income came from off-farm jobs.''   Of more than 3,000 counties in the United States, only 617 areconsidered agriculturally dependent, he said. And those account forless than 7 percent of the national population.   ``By the late 1980s, then, the old axiom that farm well-being,and by inference farm programs, determine rural well-being was nolonger useful,'' Swanson said. ``Certainly, some rural economiescontinue to depend on farming, but this is the exception rather thanthe rule.''   As to the assumption that rural people, except for farmers, aredoing all right, Swanson said that claim has been based on reportsof rural population growth. Between 1973 and 1983, rural countiesdid grow faster than urban counties, and many social expertsproclaimed a rural renaissance.   ``However, most of the population growth was due to a combinationof residential mobility and natural population growth,'' he said.``The former was simply part of the post-World War II process ofsuburbanization, and not migration.''   Swanson's and other studies are coming along just as Congress iscranking up again for a shot at solving the problems of ruralAmerica. Legislation for hastening rural development has cleared theSenate, and the House is working on a version.   Ironically, he said, it was the financial crunch on farmersduring the mid-1980s that spurred the renewed interest in ruraldevelopment.   ``Since part of the problem was the assumption that farmwell-being determines rural community well-being, the reintroductionof rural development in the context of a farm crisis had the effectof reaffirming this assumption,'' Swanson said.   ``The public still appears to associate farming with ruralwell-being, and to believe that the farm programs of the past 50years have helped farm families,'' he added. ``In fact, the evidenceis that these programs have facilitated the decline in the number offamily farms.''   Rural development should be seen as part of a long-term nationalstrategy ``to upgrade our human resources while providing employmentopportunities and basic services,'' Swanson said. ``Unfortunately,neither Congress nor the general public appears to be willing tomake such a long-term national commitment.''</TEXT></DOC>
