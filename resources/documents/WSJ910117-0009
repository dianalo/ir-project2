Brauchli and Michael R. Sesit   Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>01/17/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A7A</SO><LP>   The eruption of war in the Middle East jolted the world'sfinancial and commodity markets, but they stabilized quicklyand some even reversed course.   Oil prices spiked up to $40 a barrel, then fell back to$35. The dollar soared as some investors sought a haven fromthe war, then just as quickly started plummeting asbattle-ready traders took profits. Japanese stocks sank, thenrebounded. Gold jumped, but not as high as some had expected,and then it too partly retreated.</LP><TEXT>   In the U.S. last night, money managers clustered aroundradios and television sets in their offices, making plans tohandle today's markets and investors shaken by the war'sstart.   &quot;It seems like people anticipated that we're going towar,&quot; so a lot of the news's impact had already beendiscounted by the market, said Joel Tillinghast, portfoliomanager of Fidelity Investments' Low-Priced Stock Fund.   As the evening wore on, some analysts suggested theinitial negative reaction to the war may have dissipated.   &quot;I would expect a sharp rally today,&quot; said CarmineGrigoli, chief investment strategist for First Boston Corp.&quot;What I've seen so far is particularly encouraging. Allindications are that our military hardware seems to beworking, which in the minds of many investors is a majorplus.&quot;   At Charles Schwab andamp; Co., the nation's largest discountbrokerage concern, telephones were reported to be ringing 25%more often than usual last night. &quot;The majority of callersare not panicking,&quot; said Hugo Quackenbush, senior vicepresident. &quot;They are looking for buying opportunities.&quot;   U.S. stock markets all said they planned to open on timethis morning. Some stock-trading concerns were open forbusiness last night, including First Boston-where traderssaid they had more buying than selling interest-and Instinet,an electronic order-matching system. At 10 p.m. EST, Instinetsaid it had orders for about 700,000 shares.   Barely 30 minutes after the bombing of Baghdad startedyesterday evening, the New York Stock Exchange announced itsintention to open as usual at 9:30 a.m. EST today. TheAmerican Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq over-the-countermarket also plan to open on time.   Within minutes of the news of hostilities, some oiltraders in Tokyo were quoting West Texas Intermediate at asmuch as $40 a barrel, up $8 from its closing level Wednesdayon the New York Mercantile Exchange. But prices quicklystabilized at about half that gain, and a kind of tense calmprevailed in the market late Thursday morning in Asia.   &quot;I don't think it's going much higher in the short term,&quot;said Hideo Ito, an oil trader at Japan's Mitsui andamp; Co. tradinggroup. &quot;People have had months to get used to this.Everything now depends on the effect on oil fields andfacilities and whether tankers will enter the Persian Gulf.&quot;   In the U.S., there was trading in the socalled cashmarket, where oil is sold for immediate physical delivery. Onthe West Coast, traders were scrambling to buy crude for asmuch as $38 a barrel.   Gasoline quotes also spurted, with prices for delivery inLos Angeles quoted at $1 a gallon, up about 12 cents fromlevels earlier in New York futures trading.   Late last night, President Bush instructed the EnergyDepartment to offer for sale more than one million barrels ofoil a day from the U.S.'s strategic stockpiles. The presidentsaid he was taking the action &quot;to promote stability in worldmarkets.&quot;   The dollar jumped to 137.90 yen and 1.55 marks in earlytrading Thursday in Tokyo, compared with 136.80 yen and1.5455 marks late Wednesday in New York. Within a half-hourafter the U.S. attack began, however, the dollar startedfalling. By 10 p.m. Wednesday EST, the dollar stood at 134.10yen, down almost 3% from its peak, and 1.5180 marks, downmore than 2%.   Meanwhile, Japanese stocks began climbing back from theirinitial decline. An hour before the close of tradingThursday, the Nikkei Index of 225 stocks was up 842.85 pointsat 23285.55.   &quot;The market is far, far from falling apart,&quot; as many hadpredicted it would, said G. Tad Lindsey, a broker at NomuraSecurities Co. in Tokyo.   Brokers said investors started buying stocks heavily afterthe initial decline, apparently on the hope that any warbetween the U.S.-led international coalition and Iraq wouldend quickly. &quot;Some people think it may end very soon, muchsooner than expected,&quot; said Mikio Fujino, an institutionalsalesman for Nikko Securities Co.   Interest rates held firm, with slight decreases in Euroyenand Japanese government bond futures prices. U.S. Treasurybond futures were off slightly early Thursday in Tokyo.   Initial reports of the hostilities caused prices of U.S.Treasury bond futures contracts to drop about one pointduring the night trading session at the Chicago Board ofTrade. The price drop quickly triggered a huge buying wave bybargain-hunting securities firms, sending the March contractup more than one point during the session and erasing theinitial decline.   &quot;Nikko, Daiwa, and Goldman Sachs all started to buy,&quot; saidAvi Goldfeder, a trader for Quantum Financial Services. &quot;Theywere trading on the low price and also on speculation thatthe U.S. had already won.&quot;   Early Thursday in Hong Kong, bullion for physical deliverywas quoted at $409 an ounce, up $5.75 from its level of lateWednesday in New York. It briefly rose to $410 but eased fromthat level as the hesitancy of other markets spread tobullion.   At Macquarie Bank Ltd. in Sydney, Australia, orders pouredin, particularly from the U.S. and Japan, said NicholasCurtis, executive director in the bullion division.   Some of these orders originated on the floor of New York'sCommodity Exchange, where a mock trading session was inprogress yesterday evening after a seminar and cocktail partyfor futures industry officials and guests. As news that warhad begun rolled across the display panel, waiters circulatedwith hors d'oeuvres. The &quot;traders&quot; turned to each other inconfusion -- was this part of the exercise or the real thing?   Further reports persuaded the professional traders, whohad been mingling with investors and analysts, to ease out ofthe pit and head for phones along the wall to place orders inAustralia and Hong Kong.   New York's five major commodity exchanges said they wouldopen as usual today. The New York Mercantile Exchange, whereoil-futures contracts are traded, has put in place anemergency measure that would halt trading for an hour if theprice of crude oil moves by $7.50 a barrel. If, after tradingresumes, the price moves by another $7.50 a barrel, pricescouldn't move any further in that direction for the remainderof the day, but trading would continue.   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange approved a system ofemergency price limits for foreign currency futurescontracts. Trading in currency options will halt while theunderlying currency futures contracts are at their pricelimits.   Spokesmen at major U.S. mutual fund companies said callingvolume was light last night. Larry Dwyer, spokesman forFidelity Investments, said, &quot;My guess is that people who weregoing to move have moved.&quot; A spokesman for T. Rowe Price Co.said the company has arranged to increase its telephone staffcapacity by 50% today.   Franklin Group of Funds in San Mateo, Calif., said itreceived a record number of calls from shareholders Mondayand Tuesday but that &quot;since the attack was announced, thephones have been dead silent.&quot; A spokeswoman added: &quot;But weexpect a huge volume of calls {today} and have prepared extrastaff to handle them.&quot;   In Lansing, Mich., Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. brokerRobert Kilbridge, who had left work for the day, headed backto the firm's regional office to spend the night watchingdata come in on the Quotron and Telerate machines.   For several days, he said, clients have been deluging himwith calls, many worried about the market impact of war andseveral wanting to trade crude oil futures. He tried to talkthem out of that and into Treasury bonds, he said, becausethe oil market is so volatile and losses can be huge.   His main concern was the U.S. Treasury bond futuresmarket; most of his clients have Treasury bond holdings. &quot;Ianticipate talking to lots and lots of people,&quot; he said.&quot;I'll be telling them to hold tightany negative reaction isgoing to be shortterm, and I'm still positive.&quot;   Tokyo stocks tumbled 3.3% Wednesday as the expiration ofthe U.N.'s deadline for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwaitheightened Japanese investors' fears of war in the PersianGulf.   In London, shares closed lower in a quiet sessionWednesday, as investors were hesitant to enter the marketwhile uncertainty prevailed in the Gulf.   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 stocks closed Wednesday at22442.70, down 770.53 from Monday. The market was closedTuesday for a holiday. Volume was low, with an estimated 240million shares traded, up from 189 million shares Monday.   Decliners outnumbered advancers 93750, while 67 issueswere unchanged.   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues in the firstsection was down 47.80 points, or 2.8%, at 1647.56.   The Second Section Index dropped 46.70 points, or 1.8%, to2526.09. Volume in the section was estimated at three millionshares, down from 3.2 million shares Monday.   Stocks plummeted in the first hour of trading, rallyingslightly in feverish trading just before the morning close.There were a few tense moments on the floor of the TokyoStock Exchange at 2 p.m. local time, the hour at which theU.N. deadline for Saddam Hussein's troops to withdraw fromKuwait expired; hardly any traders could be seen flashinghand signals. After almost 10 minutes of eerie calm, thefloor broke into applause upon completion of the first largetransaction after the U.N. deadline.   Now that war has broken out in the Gulf, Tokyo stockprices are almost certain to begin a slow, steady decline,according to Craig Chudler, an analyst at UBS-Phillips andamp; DrewInternational Ltd.   The Nikkei Index &quot;doesn't have to drop in a straight line,but we'll see a continued weakening trend,&quot; he said.   A few market participants, however, emphasize that overthe longer term, Tokyo stock prices are more likely to beinfluenced by domestic fundamentals than by daily reportsfrom the battlefront. The Nikkei hadn't &quot;been movingspecifically on Gulf-related stories, although of courseeveryone mentions it,&quot; said Benedicte Ivey, an analyst atCredit Lyonnais Securities in Japan. &quot;A big piece of bad newsmight send the market down sharply for a while, but at theend of the day, people here are likely to respond more tointerest rates and corporate earnings.&quot;   Jeff Bahrenburg, a strategist at Lehman Brothers JapanInc., concurred. &quot;My guess is that any sell-off will be atemporary phenomenon,&quot; he said. Even with the Gulf war, Mr.Bahrenburg says Japanese investors are unlikely to flee themarket unless there is extensive damage to the region's oilfields. He recommends investors consider increasing theirholdings in Tokyo stocks if the Nikkei sinks near 20000. &quot;Weanticipate a market recovery sometime in the second or thirdquarter,&quot; he said. &quot;Now is the time to steel up yourcourage.&quot;   While most sectors posted losses Wednesday, rising oilprices and higher interest rates hurt electric utilitiesshares particularly, traders said.   Tokyo Electric Power fell 160 yen to 3,600 yen ($1.18 to$26.54), while Chubu Electric Power fell 160 to 2,730.   Trading houses and plant-engineering companies were alsolower, with Marubeni down 35 to 650 and Chiyoda falling 140to 1,690 yen.   Among a small number of gainers were Teikoku Oil, whichhas oil and natural gas resources outside the Middle East.Teikoku spurted 90 to 1,020.   In London, although one trader said he had seen morebuying than selling in the session, many dealers reported anear-absence of business Wednesday as the market waited forsomething to happen in the Persian Gulf.   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index closeddown 16.1 points at 2054.8. The Financial Times 30 ShareIndex fell 14 points to 1606.3.   BTR fell 12 pence to 296 pence (23 cents to $5.65).Stockbroker Robert Fleming andamp; Co. cut its pretax profitexpectations for 1990 to #930 million from #1 billion. For1991, Fleming predicts pretax profit of #960 million, downfrom #1.05 billion. Fleming said it based the revision onsterling's strength against the dollar and an anticipatedslow recovery in world economies.   British Aerospace's Royal Ordnance arms unit is buying theGerman rifle maker Heckler andamp; Koch for an undisclosed amount.British Aerospace gained 7 to 538. Traders also said theshares were helped by an anticipated rise in demand fordefense products generated by the Gulf conflict.   Grand Metropolitan, a foods and drinks group, fell 10 to627 on concern that its planned breweries-for-pubs swap toElders IXL may be delayed because of the weak U.K. propertymarket.   Glaxo finished unchanged at 827. The Swedish companyAstra, maker of the antiulcer treatment Losec, a challengerto Glaxo's Zantac, is still in discussions with the U.S. Foodand Drug Administration over the marketing of the product.
