The Nikkei,which fluctuated on both sides of 25000 through the session,also was supported by a moderate amount of arbitrage buying.   In Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei fell 69.56 points to close themorning session at 24879.70.   Thursday's first-section volume was estimated at 430million shares, down modestly from 457.3 million shares onWednesday. The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of allfirst-section issues, which fell 7.18 points Wednesday, rose9.54 points to 1886.63. The market remained stable, despitesome poor corporate earnings reports for the first half.   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-shareindex declined 32.8 points, or 1.3%, to 2528.3, just abovethe intraday low. The FT 30-stock index gave up 29.5 points,or 1.5%, to 1936.6. Volume was 595.5 million shares, up from407.3 million shares a day earlier. Prices were driven downby a poor early performance on Wall Street, afterdurable-goods data indicated little scope for aninterest-rate reduction, and by pessimistic comments from aBritish treasury spokesman on the possibility of further cutsin base lending rates, now at 10.5%.   In Frankfurt, stock prices ended mostly lower in subdueddealings. The DAX 30stock index fell 8.8 points to 1579.01.News affecting the market was thin, and most stocks hadlittle change in prices.   In Milan, the securities industry watchdog committeeConsob suspended the stockbroker Claudio Capelli from thebourse, after the regulator said it found &quot;seriousirregularities&quot; in Mr. Capelli's management of his clients'portfolios. Consob wasn't more specific. Mr. Capelli laterresigned from the Milan Brokers' Executive Committee, whichmanages the bourse. Mr. Capelli as recently as Wednesday haddenied rumors he was facing any financial difficulties,rumors of which had pressured the Milan market. The bourseresponded positively to the Consob market-protection move toallay investors' jitters, caused by speculation that manysmaller brokerage firms have financial troubles because ofthe sharp drop in trading volume, lower fees and fallingprices. The bourse has been struggling under a punitivecapital gains tax, slow and often illprepared market reforms,a major international trading scandal last summer and astrike by floor traders earlier this month.   Amsterdam's broad decline resulted from Wall Street's weakopening, London's drop, and profit-taking. In Paris,technical buying pulled most share prices higher, though someplayers were sidelined by concerns about mounting laborunrest that culminated in a one-day strike by publicsectorworkers throughout France. Swedish shares' rise was the fifthin a row.   Hong Kong stocks fell sharply as investors took profits,wiping out strong early gains and then eroding most of therise from the previous day's rally. Singapore shares weakenedon widespread profit-taking. Taipei stock prices rosebroadly, buoyed by expectations that a demonstration plannedfor today by political opposition groups is unlikely to turnviolent. In Wellington, the previous day's sharp fall in theNew Zealand dollar boosted shares of exporting companies andthose with significant foreign dealings, lifting the market.   Among corporate developments, in London, Hanson slumped 41/2 pence, or 2.1%, to 212 pence ($3.60) on heavy volume, andImperial Chemical Industries skidded 39 pence, or 3%, to#12.48 ($21.21). Hanson declined to comment on midday rumorsthat it had sold shares of ICI, a chemical and pharmaceuticalgiant in which the conglomerate has a 2.8% stake, 20 millionshares with a current value of #249.6 million ($424.2million). ICI said it didn't know whether the holding hadbeen sold. Then Hanson called its stake an &quot;investment&quot; andindicated its interest in long-term cooperation with ICI,which has rebuffed such suggestions. Amid the confusion,market specialists said yesterday's stake-sale speculationsignaled a new bout of bear raids, in which an investor ortrader deliberately spreads false and damaging rumors about acompany in hopes of making a quick profit as the concern'sstock price temporarily plunges.   In Paris, Generale des Eaux rose 4 French francs to 2,371francs ($406.34). The diversified water treatment andenvironmental concern's first-half consolidated group profitrose 13% to 1 billion francs ($172.1 million) from a yearearlier. The company said it expects 1991 profit of 2.5billion francs, a 14% increase.   Alcatel-Alsthom added 2 to 598. The telecommunications andengineering company's Alcatel N.V. agreed in principle to buymost of the cable unit of AEG, a German electronicsconglomerate that is 80%-owned by the Daimler-Benz industrialgroup of Germany. AEG, which is expected to post a group lossfor this year, had said its profitable Kabel subsidiarydidn't fit its strategic needs. In Frankfurt, AEG eased 50pfennigs to 186.90 marks ($109.24), and Daimler declined 5marks to 674 marks.   Source Perrier dropped 5 francs to 1,315 francs. Themineral water and cheese unit of Exor said its first-halfprofit, after payments to minority interests, plunged 55% to389 million francs. But the company said it expects 1991earnings will show a broad improvement, because of strongersales anticipated for the fourth quarter and 146 millionfrancs of one-time gains in the second half. The recoveryalso will reflect the exceptional losses in the 1990 secondhalf, when benzene contamination forced the company to recallmillions of bottles of its sparkling mineral water.   In Sydney, Amcor jumped 20 cents, or 3.1%, to 6.60Australian dollars (US$5.17). The paper and packaging companysaid at the annual meeting that it expects to post operatingprofit for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 &quot;well ahead&quot; ofyear-earlier results and in line with Amcor's own previousestimates.   M.I.M. Holdings rose 4 cents, or 1.8%, to A$2.25. Themining company reported a loss of A$3.5 million for the itsfirst quarter ended Sept. 22, compared with year-earlierprofit of A$13.1 million. The latest result is after anunrealized foreign-exchange loss of A$1.6 million, comparedwith an exchange loss of A$18.6 million a year earlier.M.I.M. said sharply lower metals prices offset higher salesvolumes for copper and gold and the benefits of a weakerAustralian dollar in the latest quarter.
