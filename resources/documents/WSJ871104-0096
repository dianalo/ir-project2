The integrated natural gas company produced oil last year at a rate of about 13,000 barrels a day.    The company said it found oil in St. Mary's Parish, La.; the South King Mountain area of the Permian Basin in Upton County, Texas; the Big Horn Basin in Washakie County, Wyo., and in Campbell County, Wyo. Production from the wells ranges from 100 barrels a day to 372 barrels a day.    In addition, the company said it recently had two natural gas finds. The first well on South Marsh Island 81 in the Gulf of Mexico discovered gas, and follow-up drilling is being evaluated, the company said. A well in Somerset County, Pa., tested at 1.7 million cubic feet a day from the Oriskany formation, Consolidated said. The company owns 100% of the Gulf property and 75% of the Pennsylvania property.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Consolidated shares closed at $35.75, down 75 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
