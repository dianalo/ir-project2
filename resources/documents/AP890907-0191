AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>QUARRY HEIGHTS, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The U.S. Southern Command onThursday accused Panama's Defense Forces of jamming English-languageradio and television broadcasts aimed at the American military basedin Panama.   It said in a communique that the jamming ``could potentiallythwart U.S. Forces' Canal defense missions or endanger military andcivilian personnel if it prevented the reception of emergencyCommand advisories.''   Repeated telephone calls to Defense Forces spokesmen for commentwere unavailing.   Jamming occurs when there are news reports about Panama orrelated stories, a Southern Command official said.   The Command's TV station Southern Command Network carries local,national and international news and programs for the U.S. forces andtheir dependents in Panama. The signal is beamed from a hill in theformer U.S. Canal Zone and can be received up to 50 miles away.   No opposition news media are allowed in Panama.   The Southern Command encompasses 10 military installations wherenearly 14,000 soldiers and their dependents are based.   Under terms of the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties, the bases mayremain until the end of 1999, when Panama takes full responsibilityfor operation and defense of the waterway.   Panamanian-U.S. relations have been tense since two U.S. grandjuries indicted Pnama's leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on drugtrafficking charges in February 1988.   The Southern Command also complained of jamming of its TVprograms before and after the May 7 presidential election.   At the time, the Panamanian government denied it was jamming thebroadcasts.   International observers said the opposition won the election,which Noriega had annulled.   As Defense Forces chief, he is the most powerful man in Panama.   Hundreds of university students staged a brief anti-governmentprotest Thursday by forming a human chain on campus, but noincidents occurred. They were protesting the arrest of threestudents during disturbances last month.</TEXT></DOC>
