(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. Housing Secretary Jack Kemp called onAmericans to meet their obligation to society, saying the work ofvolunteers is absolutely essential to conquering the problem ofhomelessness.   ``There are people in this country who are hurting. Those thathave been blessed have an obligation to be a blessing to someoneelse,'' Kemp said in a speech to a group of federal officialsTuesday.   The secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Developmentpledged to cut red tape and improve coordination among governmentagencies and non-profit groups who help the homeless.   Kemp portrayed the fight against homelessness as part of a widerbattle against poverty and despair.   Kemp's pep talk to the Interagency Council on the Homeless, wherehe announced a rent-subsidy grant program, followed a tour of ahomeless shelter that was empty for the day and a visit to a soupkitchen, where he was jeered.   Meanwhile, in an interview published in The New York Times today,Kemp proposed ways to rid the troubled HUD agency ofinfluence-peddling. He said he would seek to base the awarding ofsubsidies on merit rather than on the discretion of departmentofficials, and to require that consultants register their fees.   ``I'm not chairman of the Republican National Committee,'' Kempsaid. Funding decisions ``will be based on objective criteria,competition, merit, and need, not who you know or what your partyis.''   Under Kemp's predecessor, Samuel Pierce, HUD officials steeredhousing subsidies to developers who had hired politically connectedGOP consultants.   Kemp said he would propose a mix of administrative, regulatory,and legislative measures, as well as making all financing decisionspublic.   At the St. Elizabeth's House soup kitchen in Hartford, Kemp wassurrounded by reporters and photographers in the doorway and nevermade it inside the room for a complete tour.   His speech gave an outline for what he termed the ``first steps''in the effort to end homelessness. He said the government would cutthrough red tape and make it easier for homeless people and thosewho provide for them to receive government assistance.   ``We would not be a moral society, we would not be aJudeo-Christian society, if we did not recognize our obligation''Kemp said.   Kemp conceded that government procedures have resulted in a poorrecord for helping the homeless. He said that since 1983 only 293homes have been leased and 183 sold to organizations helping thehomeless.   Kemp said HUD has 49,200 houses available at a 10 percentdiscount for purchase by non-profit organizations that can pay cashat closing. In the past, he said, eligibility for such sales werelimited to tax-supported entitities, shutting out charitable groupsthat had no funding from the government.   He also announced a joint venture between HUD and a philanthropicgroup, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, to create as many as1,200 housing units in eight cities. HUD will provide rent subsidiesworth about $36 million over five years and $2.4 million infoundation grants will be used for support services.</TEXT></DOC>
