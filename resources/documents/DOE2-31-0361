(2) If supply is adequate, will the cost be competitivewith other fuels? This paper describes the efforts of various governmentaland private groups to maintain a data base capable of answering thesequestions. The paper examines some elements of the data base and howthey have been derived, then summarizes some of the results to date.The results of the study are useful at this stage primarily as a majordata base of resource information and for comparing costs from one areato another. Future gas supplies are not merely an economic concept inwhich price is the only determinant of supply, nor is it appropriateto blindly extrapolate past relationships between drilling and reserveadditions. The resource exists at different places under different conditionsand the costs and results of exploration can vary widely. It is truethat, in general, the largest fields in any exploratory play are foundearly and the smaller fields are found later in the cycle. But thereare many irregularities and the results of exploratory drilling are notsystematic or predictable. Factors related to demand, competition, price,infrastructure (pipelines and support services) and experience all contributeto determine gas supply. It appears from this work, however, that itcan be shown that a considerable supply of gas exists which can be broughtinto the market at a realistic cost, given consistent demand and reasonablestability of price. 18 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
