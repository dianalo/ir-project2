Physiological response and [32P]ADPribosylation experiments were performed to investigate whether pertussistoxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) wereinvolved in the transduction of the alpha 2-adrenergic signal. For physiologicalresponse studies, the effects of pertussis toxin on melatonin releasein dissociated cell cultures exposed to norepinephrine were assessed.Pertussis toxin blocked alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated inhibitionin a dose-dependent manner. Pertussis toxin-induced blockade appearedto be noncompetitive. One and 10 ng/ml doses of pertussis toxin partiallyblocked and a 100 ng/ml dose completely blocked norepinephrine-inducedinhibition. Pertussis toxin-catalyzed [32P]ADP ribosylation of G-proteinsin chick pineal cell membranes was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamidegel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Membranes were prepared fromcells that had been pretreated with 0, 1, 10, or 100 ng/ml pertussistoxin. In the absence of pertussis toxin pretreatment, two major proteinsof 40K and 41K mol wt (Mr) were labeled by [32P]NAD. Pertussis toxinpretreatment of pineal cells abolished [32P] radiolabeling of the 40KMr G-protein in a dose-dependent manner. The norepinephrine-induced inhibitionof both cAMP efflux and melatonin release, as assessed by RIA of mediumsamples collected before membrane preparation, was also blocked in adose-dependent manner by pertussis toxin. Collectively, these resultssuggest that a pertussis toxin-sensitive 40K Mr G-protein labeled by[32P]NAD may be functionally associated with alpha 2-adrenergic signaltransduction in chick pineal cells.</TEXT></DOC>
