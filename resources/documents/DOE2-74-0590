<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-74-0590 </DOCNO><TEXT>The present invention relates to the cutting, chipping, and chopping ofwood and, more particularly, to a machine using a knife-like blade forcutting and chipping wood into relatively large pieces in a directiontransverse, or at least approximately transverse, to the orientationand direction of the grain. In accordance with the invention, the bladeis oriented with regard to the angle of cutting to run between 70 and30 degrees to the direction of fiber and grain. This oblique mode ofcutting permits a lowering of the force requirement for advancing theblade by about two thirds of the force requirement inherent in verticalcutting devices. A cut carried out with a relatively oblique angel ispreferably used for cutting wood having many knots, while a shallowerangle of cutting is used for hardwood grains.</TEXT></DOC>
