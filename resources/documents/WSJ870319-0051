The biotechnology concern is awaiting approval from state regulators to begin open-air testing of the microbe, which is designed to protect crops from frost damage. As previously reported, the federal Environmental Protection Agency last month reinstated Advanced Genetic's test permit, and approved three possible test sites in California. The company said it expects the field test of the product, which it calls Frostban, to begin this spring.    The EPA originally granted permission for a field test of the microbe in November 1985, but suspended the permit three months later after it was disclosed that the company had violated federal regulations in initial tests of the product. Advanced Genetic eventually paid a $13,000 fine and repeated the earlier experiments.    Brentwood is a suburban and agricultural community about 40 miles east of San Francisco. Advanced Genetic said that, although their approval isn't a requirement for proceeding with the test, county supervisors this week voted in support of the Brentwood site.    Contra Costa County Supervisor Nancy Fahden said the board's unanimous vote came after the county's agricultural community voiced support at public hearings on the matter. The selling point to some supervisors was the idea that &quot;this process could be a way of reducing the use of pesticides and herbicides&quot; in the future, she said. </TEXT></DOC>
