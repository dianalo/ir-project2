Carroll@  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL><DD> 09/05/89 </DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO><CO> IBM </CO><IN> COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR) </IN><TEXT>   International Business Machines Corp. will announce today some models of its AS/400 minicomputer line and a new release of its operating-system software, industry executives said.    The announcement is designed to provide a kicker for the AS/400, which has been phenomenally successful in the year it has been available but which has lately seen its momentum slow in an important area.    In Armonk, N.Y., an IBM spokesman said the company has scheduled a press briefing for today related to its midrange product lines but declined to elaborate.    The industry executives said IBM will announce models in the middle of the AS/400 line to get customers to upgrade from the IBM System 36, the less powerful of the two lines that IBM combined into the AS/400. Sales to System 36 users have fallen short of expectations, consultants said, because many don't need more power and because moving their software to the AS/400 can be complicated.    &quot;Customers say, 'If I'm going to go through all this pain to do this, maybe I should look at some other type of equipment,'&quot; said Steve Cohen, an analyst at SoundView Financial Group Inc. He said IBM has already begun offering sales incentives to address the problem but has made clear that it intends to do more.    Mr. Cohen said that because of the weakness he has cut his forecast of AS/400 shipments this year to between 55,000 and 60,000 machines, down from his projections late last year of 70,000 to 75,000. He added, though, that he doesn't think that poses a problem for IBM this year, because it is exceeding its expectations at the high end of the AS/400 line. Users of IBM's System 38 -- the more powerful line that was merged into the AS/400 -- have bought lots of the high-end machines because many were desperate for more computing capacity and moving their software was easy.    David Andrews, president of ADM Inc., a consulting group that recently produced a report on the AS/400, said he thinks the unexpected mix of sales will still let IBM meet its revenue forecasts. He added that IBM should actually generate more profit than expected, because profit margins are higher on the bigger machines.    &quot;If you're going to have a problem, this is the right problem to have,&quot; he said.    Mr. Andrews said he thinks the new release of the operating system will do such things as make it easier to move software from the System 36 to the AS/400 and make it easier for a non-technical person to run the equipment. He said the operating system will also allow the use of a protocol called TCP/IP, which means it will be easier for the AS/400 to talk to non-IBM equipment in a network.    Consultants said IBM clearly needs to succeed more with System 36 users if it is to maintain the momentum of the AS/400, because IBM has already grabbed most of the easy opportunities among System 38 users. George Colony, a consultant at Forrester Research, said he also worries that IBM has relied too heavily on European business for the AS/400, which sells for an average price of $150,000 to $175,000. He said he thinks IBM has been below expectations in the U.S. and predicts business in Europe will slow in the next year and a half as networks of personal computers gain popularity there.    &quot;IBM is going to sell a ton of these machines. Let there be no mistake about that,&quot; Mr. Colony said. &quot;But we're entering a period of slower growth for the AS/ 400.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
