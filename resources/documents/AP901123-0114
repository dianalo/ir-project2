Gorbachev warned Friday thata break-up of the Soviet Union could lead to ``bloodshed'' and``civil conflict,'' and said he will use all his constitutionalpowers to prevent it.   ``We will not be able to divide, and when such attempts havebeen made, the results were bloodshed and grave consequences,''Gorbachev said in a wide-ranging news conference.   He spoke shortly after the Supreme Soviet legislature endorsedhis general plans to reorganize the executive branch of government,and gave him two weeks to take steps to alleviate shortages in thenation's food supply.   The legislature also passed a ``state of the union'' resolutionasking its chairman, Anatoly Lukyanov, to begin urgent negotiationswith his counterparts in the 15 Soviet republics for agreements tostop the political disintegration of the country.   The resolution expressed serious concern about the collapse ofcentral authority, and recommended Gorbachev take all steps``authorized by law, up to extraordinary measures'' in cases wherethere is a ``threat to human life, health or property.''   It seeks to end a national paralysis of power resulting from therepublics acting independently in introducing reforms to switchfrom a centrally planned to a market economy.   All the Soviet republics except Kirgizia have declared some formof sovereignty, and the three Baltic republics have declaredindependence.   It was the second time in a week the Supreme Soviet endorsedGorbachev's proposal to eliminate the Council of Ministers, orSoviet Cabinet, and replace it with several bodies under directpresidential control.   It's unclear if the legislature will take up the Gorbachevreform plan again.   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, whose job would be eliminatedunder the government realignment, was quoted by the governmentnewspaper Izvestia as saying he was prepared to step down ifGorbachev's proposals are accepted.   Ryzhkov said the proposals, announced last Saturday byGorbachev, caught him by surprise.   Ryzhkov and radical lawmaker Anatoly Sobchak, the mayor ofLeningrad, criticized Gorbachev's proposals as sketchy.   ``There isn't any complete picture of the system of thepolitical government of the country,'' he was quoted as saying.   Gorbachev said he respected the autonomy of the republics, butthat if any of their leaders ``try to ... act in the way of anultimatum, they will destabilize the situation, and make it moredifficult. And I, as the president, also have a limit.''   Asked later whether he would use force to prevent any republicfrom seceding, Gorbachev said ``we will stay within theconstitution'' in negotiating a new union treaty to serve as acharter uniting the republics.   Any republic wishing to leave the union, he said, must respect aSoviet law passed this year requiring a referendum.   ``It is a whole divorce procedure,'' he said.   Attempts to leave the union without a referendum ``would be atragedy to our peoples,'' he said. ``It would lead to civilconflict with the most grave consequences and that would bring thecountry to a situation unacceptable to the world community, aswell.''   The resolution contained a gloomy assessment of the country'seconomic and political affairs. ``The situation in the countrycontinues to worsen and is approaching a crisis condition,'' itsaid.   The legislature also gave the KGB security police responsibilityfor dealing with what it called ``economic sabotage.''   The Supreme Soviet, in endorsing Gorbachev's plans to``streamline the executive branch,'' removed a requirement for thepresident to consult with leaders in the republics before makingthe changes.   The plan appeared designed to remove officials who are resistantto radical reform, and bring representatives of the republics intothe central government.   Under the outline, the Council of Ministers would be replaced byseveral bodies under presidential control. The principal rulingbody would be the Federation Council, grouping representatives ofthe republics.   Gorbachev offered few details on his ideas to improve theeconomy, other than saying he would propose changes in lawscovering finances, transportation, energy resources, agricultureand landholding.   The resolution called on Gorbachev, within the next two weeks,to work out a program to improve the food situation and ensuredistribution of food from abroad.   And he said that Western nations were offering food, credits andother forms of assistance to the Soviet Union during the winter.   His spokesman, Vitaly Ignatenko, said this week that Gorbachevhad won promises of up to $10 billion in aid from Germany, Italy,Canada, Spain and Britain.   President Bush also has offered to aid the Soviet Union thiswinter.</TEXT></DOC>
