Gallo, ina brief letter to the journal Nature, formally acknowledgedthis week that the AIDS virus claimed for eight years by hislab was, in fact, a virus obtained from French researchers.   The three-paragraph statement provided a terse closure toa bitter trans-Atlantic dispute over &quot;who discovered the AIDSvirus&quot; -- a dispute that clouded much of the past decade'swork on the epidemic. Patent royalties from an AIDSblood-test kit have been split 50-50 since a 1987 settlementbetween the parties, but the dispute still simmered untilrecently.</LP><TEXT>   Dr. Gallo's letter comes in response to a report by LucMontagnier of the Pasteur Institute in Paris. As reported,Dr. Montagnier's report in the journal Science two weeks agosaid the similarity between the two teams' viruses stemmedfrom the contamination of cultures by an AIDS virus strainfrom a French patient identified as LAI.   It is this scenario now endorsed by Dr. Gallo, the oftencombative chief of tumor cell biology at the National CancerInstitute, a unit of the National Institutes of Health inBethesda, Md.   &quot;It . . . appears that cultures of virus from people withAIDS became contaminated with {the human immunodeficiencyvirus} LAI at NIH,&quot; Dr. Gallo wrote. This would explain thenearly identical genetic fingerprint of viruses analyzed bythe two teams in independent publications.</TEXT></DOC>
