The same constitutional principle has applied in criminalcases since 1986, when the justices ruled that a criminaldefendant's right to &quot;equal protection&quot; under the 14thAmendment is violated when a prosecutor challenges all jurorswho are the same race as the defendant. In that opinion, thehigh court suggested that the rights of the jurors to performtheir civic duty by serving on juries also would be violatedif they are excluded because of their race.</LP><TEXT>   Since the 1986 ruling, the federal courts have beendivided over whether the principle applies to civil cases. Itis a more difficult question than it might appear because the14th Amendment only protects citizens against governmentactions, not against private conduct. In criminal trials,there is always a government prosecutor, so the requirementof state action is satisfied; in many civil trials, though,the litigants are private parties.   But in an opinion written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, thehigh court said that since court systems and the proceduresunder which they operate are the products of governmentalaction, the &quot;equal protection&quot; guarantee applies to civiltrials.   The appeal involved peremptory challenges, by whichlawyers may excuse potential jurors without having to state areason. The number of such challenges that are allowed variesfrom state to state.   Justice Sandra O'Connor, in a dissenting opinion, arguedthat the use of challenges in civil trials is privateconduct, not state action. &quot;As much as we would like toeliminate completely from the courtroom the specter of racialdiscrimination, the Constitution does not sweep thatbroadly,&quot; Justice O'Connor said. She was joined by ChiefJustice William Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia.   The high court's majority said the same standards that itoutlined in its 1986 decision apply in civil cases. Under theearlier ruling, one party to a lawsuit must show that theother side engaged in a pattern of striking jurors of aparticular race. The other side must then demonstrate that ithad a valid reason for exercising its jury challenges.Claiming that jurors of a particular race would be biasedbecause one of the parties to the lawsuit is a member of thesame race isn't a valid reason, the court said in 1986.   Yesterday's ruling involved an appeal by a constructionworker who sued a concrete company over a job-related injuryin Fort Polk, La. The worker, who is black, objected when thecompany challenged two black potential jurors.   A federal appeals court in New Orleans had ruled that theconstitutional guarantees don't apply in a civil case whenthe lawsuit involves private parties. The high court reversedthe appeals court decision. (Edmondson vs. Leesville ConcreteCo.)   In other actions, the high court:   -- Agreed to decide if the federal government can be suedfor damages under state and federal pollution laws. Theappeal by the Department of Energy involves a $250,000 finesought by Ohio for water pollution and hazardous dischargesat the Fernald nuclear weapons plant near Cincinnati.(Department of Energy vs. Ohio)   -- Let stand a federal appeals court ruling reinstating alawsuit by the states of Arizona, California, Oregon andWashington alleging that major oil companies conspired to fixwholesale gasoline prices in the early 1970s. A federal judgehad dismissed the case, which may now proceed to trial.(Chevron Corp. vs. Arizona)   -- Ruled 9-0 that Louisiana elections to fill 12 seats onlocal courts must be reviewed by the U.S. attorney general. Asection of the Voting Rights Act requires that changes invoting districts or rules be approved in advance in southernand some northern states. Justice Kennedy wrote the ruling infavor of a challenge by black voters in Louisiana. (Clark vs.Roemer)   -- Let stand a $3.5 million punitive damage verdictagainst Alabama Power Co., a Southern Co. unit. The damageswere awarded to the family of a man who was electrocuted whenhis truck door touched a wire. (Alabama Power Co. vs. Turner)   -- Left intact a ruling by New York's highest state court,the court of appeals, giving broad protection under the stateconstitution from libel lawsuits based on opinions expressedin letters to the editor of scientific journals or elsewhere.(Immuno AG vs. Moor-Jankowski)   -- Refused to hear a challenge by Planned ParenthoodFederation of America to a rule issued by the Agency forInternational Development denying AID funds to foreignorganizations that counsel women about abortion. The ruleimplemented a policy announced in Mexico City in 1984 by theReagan administration. A federal appeals court in New Yorkhad upheld the rule.
