The C {sup 1}Pi/sub u/v = 0--4, N = 1--3 states are prepared by three-photon excitation fromthe ground state. Absorption of a fourth photon from the same laser pulseleads either to H{sub 2} {sup +}+e or H+H(n = 3,4). This branching ismonitored in photoelectron spectra, taken with a novel magnetic bottleelectron spectrometer based on a permanent magnet design. The competitionbetween dissociation and ionization shows a pronounced dependence onthe symmetry, vibrational, and rotational quantum numbers of the C state.We attempt to explain this dependence in terms of excitation of dissociativeH{sub 2} states in the H{sub 2} {sup +} ionization continuum from whichboth autoionization and dissociation may occur.</TEXT></DOC>
