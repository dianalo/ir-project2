And Waste Management expects to turn that future into dollars.    Last week, New York's environmental commissioner issued the state's first set of solid-waste disposal rules, a sweeping package designed to regulate how trash is handled from the time it's picked up until it reaches its final resting place. The strict rules, likely to boost disposal costs as much as 30%, are part of what's expected to be a wave of new state laws during the 1990s to deal with waste problems.    New York's rule &quot;is going to become reasonably uniform across the country in the next few years,&quot; contends James E. Koenig, Waste Management's treasurer and a vice president. &quot;These regulations dictate more technology, and I think that's going to be beneficial for a company like this.&quot;    The environmental push is certain to move to the forefront of the national agenda, analysts and investors contend. That push has analysts recommending the stock, and some money managers scooping up shares in the Oak Brook, Ill.-based concern.    &quot;You've got a dominant company in an industry where the forward progress is virtually guaranteed,&quot; argues Gerald Levine, the partner in charge of pension-money management at Weiss, Peck andamp; Greer, New York. &quot;This stock is a core holding for those who know the industry.&quot; Mr. Levine recently has been boosting that core, and currently holds about 750,000 Waste Management shares.    Bulls on the stock point to the company's existing disposal sites. Most Waste Management sites already have the types of liners and ground-water monitoring systems that many states are expected to require in the next few years. Those state regulations are likely to send municipalities scrambling to find sites that pass environmental standards. Many of those cities, analysts argue, will be forced to relinquish the right to run their own landfills.    &quot;The company basically has been on the cutting edge of technology in the industry,&quot; says Bill Genco, a first vice president at Merrill Lynch in New York.    Despite the bullish outlook, Waste Management stock has lagged the market this year. The issue closed Friday at 37 5/8, up 1 for the day but unchanged from its Jan. 1 level.    That underperformance is a result more of market conditions than opinion of the company, argues Deborah Thielsch, who follows Waste Management for First Boston in New York. Since mid-January, she notes, cyclical stocks have outperformed growth-stock issues as investors have expected cyclical stocks to post strong earnings during the late part of the business cycle.    But in the past month, that swing has started to move back away from cyclicals as investors anticipate that many companies' earnings have peaked, and such growth stocks as Waste Management are again becoming attractive, Ms. Thielsch says.    Skeptics point to a number of questions: the company's exposure to liability from waste accidents, the risks of diversification, and pricing practices that have led to a number of price-fixing lawsuits in recent years.    But Waste Management executives are confident that liability problems won't arise because of the company's strict environmental controls. &quot;We may have a problem at a site, but we handle it and it doesn't become a major problem,&quot; Mr. Koenig says. &quot;That's the key to controlling liability.&quot;    As for the price-fixing question, the company says the matter is behind it. Further, it says that Waste Management managers know they are likely to be fired if they are found to be engaging in the practice.    The company also defends its recent diversification into lawn care, pest control and portable toilets and offices. While bears argue that the businesses won't allow the company to keep annual profit growth at more than 20%, Mr. Koenig counters that it helps Waste Management control segments of its customer base, like construction sites, which might need toilets and offices as well as waste disposal.    Analysts generally expect earnings to grow 40% this year to $2.05 a share; they project profit of $2.45 to $2.50 a share in 1989.    Meanwhile, analysts have welcomed a recent accord under which Waste Management acquired 23% of Wheelabrator Technologies. Under the agreement, Wheelabrator will build waste-to-energy plants, probably on Waste Management sites and including garbage collected by Waste Management.    In addition, the company is moving into the recycling business to try to head off the growing cry to avoid dumping garbage. While the Environmental Protection Agency is urging sharply higher levels of recycling, Waste Management has opened about 20 recycling centers. A spokesman acknowledges, however, that the program isn't expected to be what the company calls &quot;self-sufficient&quot; for five years.    But Weiss Peck's Mr. Levine is willing to ignore those potential negatives. &quot;Their asset is the landfill capacity,&quot; he says. &quot;When the world is short of capacity, it's a great position to be in.&quot;    ---   Waste Management   (NYSE; Symbol: WMX)   Business: Solid and chemical waste disposal   Year ended Dec. 31, 1987:   Revenue: $2.76 billion   Net income: $327.1 million; or $1.46 a share   Second quarter, June 30, 1988:   Per-share earnings: 51 cents vs. 37 cents   Average daily trading volume: 467,868 shares   Common shares outstanding: 226.4 million</TEXT></DOC>
