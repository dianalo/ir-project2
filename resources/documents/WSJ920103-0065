But before they buy into any of the reformproposals offered by official Washington, they and theiremployees need to understand that Washington is second tonone in good intentions gone awry.   This is especially important now, because several majorcorporations, including Chrysler, Bethlehem Steel,Dayton-Hudson, Westinghouse Electric, and Xerox have lined upbehind a &quot;mandated benefits&quot; plan requiring employers toprovide medical insurance to their employees or pay a new taxto fund a public program. The &quot;play or pay&quot; approach is boundto lead to surging costs, hiring discrimination againstworkers with large families or medical problems, endlesslawsuits brought by job-seekers who think they're victims ofsuch discrimination, and eventually to the kind ofnationalized health system none of us really wants.</LP><TEXT>   For some companies the costs of providing medicalinsurance for employees has doubled, tripled, even quadrupledin recent years. Hay/Huggins andamp; Co., a benefits consultingfirm, estimates that the typical company now pays nearly$4,500 a year for health insurance for each employee andemployee family, a 400% increase since 1980. The typicalemployee also is paying more for this coverage, saysHay/Huggins: about $1,300 a year, compared to just $150 ayear, on average, in 1980. Is it any wonder why businessmanagers want to get this monkey off their corporate backs?   The trick, of course, is to reform the present system in away that eliminates the gaps in coverage for workers in smallfirms or those changing jobs; promotes cost-consciousness;encourages competition; cuts down on the administrative paperwork that has turned most doctors' offices into accountingjungles, and delivers the kind of top-quality medical carethat Americans expect.   Most business leaders correctly reject the wholesalenationalization of American health care, knowing full wellthat it hasn't worked in any other industry and won't work inmedicine either.   Thus, after initially flirting with proposals to have theU.S. establish a Canadianor British-style national healthsystemwhich would shift the burden of funding U.S. medicineto the same lawmakers who can't balance their own checkbooks-- most corporations are now looking elsewhere. And thealternative of choice at the moment appears to be play orpay.   Under this plan, companies would be given a choice: eitherprovide at least a minimum specified package of healthinsurance benefits to all of their employees and theirfamilies, or pay into a government fund that would providecoverage to the uninsured. Either way, many executivesfigure, they will be better off financially than they aretoday. The reasoning is simple: For more than 45 years --ever since the IRS ruled that company-paid medical benefitsare tax free to employees -- employees receiving suchbenefits have been pushing for companies to provide more&quot;free&quot; coverage. In unionized workplaces, tax-free medicalbenefits frequently are considered a much higher prioritythan taxable wages.   In theory, because it would allow companies to pay a fixedtax (a figure of 7% of payroll currently is being touted) asan alternative to ever-more-costly health insurance, play orpay would get many employers off the hook -- or so theythink.   In reality, nothing starts off small and simple inWashington and stays that way -- especially if Congress canmandate increases in benefits without raising taxes. Thus,over time, the &quot;basic&quot; benefits package inevitably will grow.When constituents start complaining that the basic benefitssupplied by their employers don't cover this and don'tinclude that, Congress will start including more servicesunder the mandated minimum and reducing the co-paymentsrequired of beneficiaries.   Additional pressure to expand the minimum benefits packagewould come from those &quot;providers&quot; initially excluded from thesystem. Having the government require people to buy insurancethat pays for the service you provide is a nice way toincrease demand for that service, whether it's orthopedicsurgery or acupuncture treatments. State lawmakers alreadyhave done so, enacting more than 800 laws during the past 15years requiring insurers to cover specific providers orservices -- even when there was little consumer demand.   When insurance costs get high enough, equaling orexceeding the costs of paying into the government insurancefund, business executives will either find ways to cut costs,or drop the company insurance and pay the government'snon-insurance tax.   With the government at least partially determining thenature of the insurance coverage a company offers, cuttingcosts becomes tricky -- and invites trouble. The surest wayto cut insurance costs is to reduce the full-time work force,or make sure you hire people unlikely to incur high medicalcosts.   Imagine how a personnel manager would react to anoverweight candidate for a minimum wage job who smokedheavily during the interview and insisted on showing themanager pictures of his five kids. Required by law to providemedical coverage to such a worker and his family, the companywould have a powerful incentive to avoid hiring him, or todump such workers into the government pool.   If this sounds illegal, you're probably right. Even ifit's not illegal today, it will become illegal. Under themain bill in Congress to create a play or pay system,sponsored by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,companies electing to provide insurance could face heavyfines and crippling damage suits if there is reason tobelieve they discriminated in their hiring practices againstworkers considered high medical risks. That would open theway for unsuccessful job-seekers to claim they were deniedemployment because they have diabetes, or hypertension, orbecause they smoke, or are 30 pounds overweight, or have fivekids. Faced with the prospect of such lawsuits, on top of allthe problems of keeping health insurance costs under control,doubtless most employers would choose to pay, not play.   Thus play or pay is a weigh station on the road to a giantMedicaid program for all Americans -- a phony alternativethat will become so unattractive over time that eventuallywe'll get those long lines and waiting lists, so common inCanada and Britain, despite ourselves.   ---   Mr. Butler is director of domestic policy studies at theHeritage Foundation, Washington, and co-author (with EdmundHaislmaier) of &quot;A National Health System for America&quot;(Heritage, 1989).</TEXT></DOC>
