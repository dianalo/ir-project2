Hariri went on trial Monday on charges of murder, attemptedmurder, hostage-taking and four lesser counts stemming from the July24, 1987, hijacking. The DC-10, which carried 164 passengers, wasdiverted to Geneva while en route from the Congolese capital ofBrazzaville to Paris.   The defendant said passenger Xavier Beaulieu, 28, was shot whenhe got out of his seat and made a threatening move.   Chief Judge Jean-Jacques Leu noted that according to a forensicexpert, Beaulieu was shot in the head from behind from less than afoot away. Beaulieu's head had been covered with a blanket, Leu said.   ``Pretending that you killed him accidentally is an absurdattitude,'' prosecutor Willy Heim told Hariri. ``It will turnagainst you.''   Hariri declined to confirm that he had been on a Hezbollahmission at the time of the hijacking. He said he would not talkabout his ``private life and political activities.''   ``What I did was by conviction,'' he said.   Hezbollah is Lebanon's most militant Moslem faction. It isconsidered an umbrella for the groups holding most of the 15 foreignhostages in Lebanon. A Swiss Red Cross delegate was held captive fora month in Lebanon late last year in an apparent attempt to win alenient sentence for Hariri. The Swiss said no concessions were made.   Police carrying submachine guns guarded the Federal CriminalCourt, which only hears cases of particular gravity and lastconvened six years ago. The court building was ringed by barbed wireand nearby streets were closed to traffic.   The bearded defendant, wearing an olive-colored jacket, insistedon a court interpreter but frequently switched from Arabic to French.   Hariri suggested the court had no standing to try him.   ``I did not take any action against the Swiss,'' he said. ``Thiswas not a Swiss plane. There was no Swiss among the passengers. Idid not have any demands from the Swiss except refueling. That iswhy I protest this judgment.''   During the hijacking, authorities said Hariri threatened to blowup the plane with TNT. However, he told the court the threat ``wasjust words, I did not intend to explode it.''   Asked by the chief judge to confirm that he paid the equivalentof $6 to bypass security checks at Bangui, the capital of CentralAfrica, where he boarded the plane, Hariri said: ``I do not know.''   After seizing control of the plane over Italy, the hijackerdemanded to be flown to Beirut but agreed to stop in Geneva forfuel. After the plane landed at Cointrin Airport, the hijacker shotand killed Beaulieu and threatened to kill another Frenchman.   Crew members subdued Hariri after a Congolese steward was shotand seriously injured. Police stormed the plane when passengersopened the emergency doors.</TEXT></DOC>
