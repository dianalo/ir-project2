The Pompano Beach, Fla., maker of power conversion units and measurement and control devices, which announced its restructuring program last month, said that as part of the plan, it would drop nonstrategic product lines, consolidate its remaining product lines into four divisions, and streamline sales and management. John N. Lemasters, chairman, said the company is committed to meeting its goal of &quot;returning to operational profitability&quot; by year end.    As a result of the restructuring, Computer Products said it will cut about 150 people from its 1,000-person U.S. payroll.    The company also said it sold its discontinued TCS distributed control system product line for about $2.7 million in notes, securities and cash to Diamond Electronics Inc., a closely held, Lancaster, Ohio, maker of automation systems. Computer Products said it expects to receive $1 million from the sale this year. </TEXT></DOC>
