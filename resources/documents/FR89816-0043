The assessment provides a basis for theconclusion that the field testing of these genetically engineered alfalfaplants will not present a risk of introduction of dissemination of a plantpest and will not have any significant impact on the quality of the humanenvironment. Based upon this finding of no significant impact, the Animaland Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an environmentalimpact statement need not be prepared.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Copies of the environmental assessment and findingof no significant impact are available for public inspection at Biotechnology,Biologics, and Environmental Protection, Animal and Plant Health Inspectionservice, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 850, Federal Building, 6505Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Dr. Quentin B.

A permit must be obtainedbefore a regulated article can be introduced in the United States. Theregulations set forth procedures for obtaining a limited permit for theimportation or interstate movement of a regulated article and for obtaininga permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article. TheAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has stated that it wouldprepare an environmental assessment and, when necessary, an environmentalimpact statement before issuing a permit for the release into the environmentof a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906). The Northrup King Company, of Stanton, Minnesota, has submitted an applicationfor a permit for release into the environment, to field test alfalfa plantsgenetically engineered to express a gene from <T3>Streptomyces viridochromogenes</T3>, which provides resistance to theglufosinate-class of herbicides. The field trial will take place in Stanton,Minnesota. In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the alfalfa plant under the conditionsdescribed in the Northrup King Company application. APHIS concluded thatthe field testing will not present a risk of plant pest introduction ordissemination and will not have any significant impact on the quality ofthe human environment. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by the Northrup King Company, as well as areview of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentationof APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated withconducting the field testing. The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. A gene from <T3>Streptomyces viridochromogenes </T3>has been inserted into an alfalfachromosome. The expression of this gene provides resistance to the glufosinate-classof herbicides. In nature, genetic material contained in a chromosome isgenerally transferred to another sexually compatible plant by cross-pollination.In this field trial, no introduction gener can spread to another plantby cross-pollination, because the genetically engineered alfalfa plantswill be mowed to prevent flower formation. Thus, no pollen will be producedby any alfalfa plant in this experiment. 2. Neither the glufosinate acetyl transferase gene itself nor its geneproduct confers on alfalfa any plant pest characteristic. 3. The bacterium <T3>Streptomyces viridochromogenes</T3>, from which the glufosinate acetyltransferase gene was isolated, is not a plant pest. 4. The vector used to transfer the glufosinate acetyl transferase geneto alfalfa plant cells has been evaluated for its use in this specificexperiment and does not pose a plant pest risk in this experiment. Thevector, although derived from the DNA of a tumor inducing (Ti) plasmidwith known plant pathogenic potential, has been disarmed; that is, genesthat are necessary for pathogenicity have been removed from the vector.The vector has been tested and shown to be not pathogenic to any susceptibleplant. 5. The vector agent <T3>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</T3>, a phytopathogenic bacterium, was usedto deliver the vector DNA and the glufosinate acetyl transferase gene intoalfalfa plant cells. The vector agent has been chemotherapeutically eliminatedand shown to be no longer associated with any regenerated alfalfa plant.6. Horizontal movement or gene transfer of the glufosinate acetyl transferasegene is not possible. The vector acts by delivering and inserting the geneinto an alfalfa chromosome (i.e., chromosomal DNA). The vector does notsurvive in or on any transformed alfalfa plant. No mechanism for horizontalmovement is known to exist in nature to move an inserted gene from a chromosomeof a transformed plant to any other organism. 7. The size of the field test plot is small and will be located on a privateresearch farm in a rural area, which will provide good security. The environmental assessment and finding of no signicant impact have beenprepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental Policy Actof 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq</T3>.), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274,August 31, 1979).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done in Washington, DC, this 11th day of August 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
