Since June 4, the United States, Japan, the 12-nation EuropeanEconomic Community, Switzerland and Canada have imposed bans onimported ivory. The EEC, Japan and the United States buy up to 75percent of the ivory on world markets.   Hong Kong, the world's major ivory dealer, has announced amoratorium on raw ivory imports.   The 102-nation Convention on International Trade in EndangeredSpecies will consider a worldwide ban at a Geneva meeting in October.   The conservationists' sweeping success follows June 1 appeals bythe World Wildlife Fund and Wildlife Conservation International. Thetwo groups said poachers were wiping out the elephant populations inAfrica faster than had been thought and the pachyderms could beextinct within 15 years.   But conservationists now fear that prospects of a worldwide bancould lead poachers to a frenzy of elephant killings unless interimmeasures are taken immediately.   ``An elephant holocaust across Africa is likely unless consumercountries take immediate action,'' the World Wildlife Fund said.   France, on June 4, began the string of national actions againstimporting ivory and it was followed the next day by the UnitedStates.   Penalties vary for violations. In the United States, the maximumis a year in jail and a $100,000 fine.   President Bush, in announcing the U.S. decision, said: ``We dothis out of mounting concern for the rapid decline of the wildelephant, one of nature's most majestic creatures.   ``If their populations continue to diminish at current rates, thewild elephant will soon be lost from this Earth.''   Japan and Hong Kong are considered critical to any effectivereduction in ivory demand. Japan is the largest importer, accountingfor 40 percent of the world market, and Hong Kong is heavilyinvolved in making ivory carvings for export.   ``The real victory is Japan,'' Thomsen said. ``Hong Kong's actionwas very much to save face'' because its two biggest customers _Japan and the United States _ had outlawed imports.   ``This proves that we have taken more responsibility as consumercountries,'' he said. ``We may have prevented a catastrophe. Creditshould also be placed with the African countries, who previously hadopposed a ban but now realize the crisis situation.''   Hong Kong began enforcing its crackdown quickly. On Sunday, itseized 448 tusks and other ivory products worth an estimated $2.6million that officials said were to to have been smuggled to Japan.   Several African countries recently reversed their stands and tooksteps to protect their elephants. Last month, Kenya followedneighboring Tanzania and Somalia and called for a worldwide ban.   Delegates at an Organization of African Unity conference thatended Saturday recommended establishing a marketing cartel to ensurethat money from the worldwide ivory trade benefits the continent.   Conservationists estimate African elephant populations havedropped from 1.5 million in 1978 to between 400,000 and 700,000today.   They say ivory exports have increased from 300 tons a year in the1950s to more than 800 tons annually in this decade and prices arerunning at a record $91 per pound.   An aerial survey last year found about 20,000 elephants in Kenya.Fifteen years ago it had 121,000. The number of elephants inTanzania has fallen to 80,000 from 300,000 in 1979, according togovernment officials.   Conservationists say the elephant populations in most otherAfrican countries have suffered similar fates, but Zimbabwe,Botswana and South Africa are the exceptions because of controls.   Zimbabwe has annual elephant kills and a thriving legal trade inelephant products. In the last 12 months it earned about $600,000 inlegal ivory sales.   Poachers have killed most of the big male elephants in somecountries and now their targets are females and young beasts,according to a conservationists' report released this month.   The result is that three times as many elephants must be killedto provide the same amount of ivory as 10 years ago.   ``The annual ivory haul must be reduced to at least a tenth ofits present volume to enable populations to recover,'' the reportsays. ``The recovery of herds and family structure will take 20years or more if all poaching were stopped.''   Japan, Hong Kong and other countries with thriving ivoryindustries and markets would be badly hurt if supplies are reducedto that level.   Tamotsu Ishibashi, chairman of the Tokyo Ivory and CraftCooperative Association, said even the current ban will havedevastating effects on Japan's traditional ivory-carving industry.He said some 25,000 craftsman in about 80 workshops produce $13.8million worth of ivory products every year.   ``The majority of ivory craftsmen have passed their techniques ofcarving ivory from generation to generation, and the new restrictioncertainly will affect them severely,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
