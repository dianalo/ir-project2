On one side, there's patriotism. On the other,rank opportunism. Sometimes it's hard to tell which side iswhich.   Lorillard, the maker of Kent, Newport and True cigarettes,yesterday said it will run yellow stripes on the corner ofall its print and billboard ads. What's more, it's askingevery other advertiser to do the same, in a show of supportfor U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I'd like to see a magazine full of yellow stripes,&quot; saysAndrew Tisch, chief executive officer of Lorillard, a unit ofLoews. &quot;This isn't something that a tobacco company can orshould do by itself. I'm talking about all advertisers.&quot; Hesays Lorillard simply wants to show &quot;a symbol of thecountry's concern for the well-being and safe return&quot; of U.S.troops abroad.   It's hard to quibble with his sentiment. But fellowadvertisers are already questioning the motives behind it. &quot;Ithink it's exploiting the war,&quot; says Leo Greenland, chairmanand chief executive of ad agency Smith/Greenland, whoseclients, including Johnny Walker scotch and Tanqueray gin,have no plans to refer to the war in ads.   Consumer advocates, meanwhile, point out a certain ironyin Lorillard supporting the troops. &quot;If they're genuinelyinterested in preserving and protecting human lives, theywould quit marketing their lethal products to people,&quot; saysPhillip Wilbur, a media specialist with the Advocacy Group, anonprofit consumer group in Washington. &quot;It's a good exampleof how effectively opportunistic tobacco companies are,&quot; hesays.   If it seems Lorillard just can't win, that's precisely thepoint. The cigarette maker finds itself in the middle of adilemma facing all advertisers. Almost all support the U.S.war effort, but they're split on whether they should showthat support in advertising.   Already, Boeing has resurrected an ad, originally createdfor the patriotic holidays, showing servicemen at work.Merrill Lynch is working on new commercials wth a patrioticflair. Gannett, one of the country's largest billboardcompanies, has posted flags and yellow ribbons on some of itsbillboards around the country.   But many more advertisers are holding back, afraid ofappearing to exploit a horrible situation for their ownprofit. &quot;I admire {Mr. Tisch} for wanting to do something . .. but whether advertising is the place for that, I don'tknow,&quot; says Kenneth Olshan, chairman and chief executive ofad agency Wells, Rich, Greene, whose clients includeInternational Business Machines and Philip Morris's Benson andamp;Hedges. &quot;So far our clients are being very careful about notbeing opportunistic, and we agree with that.&quot;   During World War II, advertisers routinely putsupport-the-troops messages in their ads; indeed, they wouldbe considered unpatriotic if they didn't. Typical was an adfor Nabisco, known then as National Biscuit Co., touting itsgraham crackers as &quot;the sweet wartime `energy' food&quot; whileencouraging children to save paper. But in the decades sincethen, consumers have become infinitely more sophisticated andcynical, always searching for the motive behind the message.That's why many advertisers plan to simply avoid the waraltogether in ads.   &quot;War is a time to be patriotic, not to be self-serving,&quot;says Jay Chiat, chairman and chief executive of ad agencyChiat/Day/Mojo, who recommends steering clear of all warreferences in ads. &quot;It's not a time for any company to beperceived as opportunistic.&quot;   For his part, Lorillard's Mr. Tisch says, &quot;I'm trying mydamnedest not to&quot; exploit the war or patriotism. He adds, &quot;Ifwe wanted to profiteer, there would be a helluva lot of otherthings we could do.&quot;   Mr. Tisch is not without influence and connections. Loewsis the largest shareholder of CBS Inc., where his father,Laurence Tisch, is chief executive. But whether otheradvertisers will follow Lorillard's lead en masse is unclear.When Andrew Tisch yesterday enlisted the Association ofNational Advertisers, a trade group representing majoradvertisers, to persuade other sponsors to follow suit withyellow stripes on ads, its board decided to pass the idea onto members without endorsing it, an association spokeswomansays.   The Outdoor Advertising Association of America, whosemember companies own billboards, heard the Lorillard proposalas well. &quot;Our industry thinks it's a wonderful idea. We'regoing to encourage all our members to take this yellowstripe,&quot; a spokeswoman for that group says. She adds, though,that local advertisers may be more likely to follow Lorillardthan national advertisers, which might be reluctant to followanother company, especially a cigarette maker.   The tireless Mr. Tisch of Lorillard says he has spoken toseveral food and consumer goods companies that are alsoconsidering running the yellow stripe, but none have yetcommitted to it. &quot;Even if we're the only ones out there doingit,&quot; he says, &quot;we'll still feel pretty good that at leastwe're doing something.&quot;   ---   `Green' Labeling Claims                                                                                                          A task force of state attorneys general seems ready toback down on certain environmental ad proposals that stirredup industry protests last November.   The task force had suggested that companies advertise aproduct as &quot;recyclable&quot; only in communities where recyclingwas locally available -- a point pushed by environmentalgroups. But in hearings on the task force's report lastmonth, manufacturers contended the proposal would retard thespread of recycling efforts.   Yesterday, Minnesota Attorney General Hubert Humphrey IIIsaid that the California hearings prompted the task force torethink its proposal, and that the 11-member group is seekinga middle ground. &quot;We have to bridge that gap&quot; between beingidealistic and practical, Mr. Humphrey told Advertising Agemagazine's Green Marketing Summit in New York.   One alternative: to let companies label products as&quot;recyclable&quot; even if only a portion of the material isrecycled within a geographic area. &quot;I think that is thedirection&quot; the task force wants to go, said a spokesman forMr. Humphrey after the summit.   Next month, the task force is expected to submit its finalproposals to the Federal Trade Commission, which is underintense pressure from states and businesses to set nationalgreen marketing guidelines.   ---   Scali Loses Dimetapp                                                                                                          In yet another blow to troubled Scali, McCabe, Sloves,A.H. Robins pulled its estimated $20 million Dimetapp coldremedy account from the New York agency and awarded it toAvrett, Free andamp; Ginsberg.   A spokeswoman for Robins, a unit of American HomeProducts, said the company plans to keep the estimated $16million Robitussin cough remedy account at Scali, a unit ofWPP Group. That account also was rumored to be in review.   The spokeswoman said the switch was &quot;a business decisionrelated to the interests of the Dimetapp brand.&quot; She addedthat the company is &quot;pleased with Scali's work onRobitussin.&quot;   Scali's billings have declined to about $200 million from$280 million in 1988, as the agency lost a string of bigclients including Nikon, Lotus Development, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us andVolvo. Earlier this month, audio tape maker Maxell pulled its$3 million account. Scali Chairman Marvin Sloves didn'treturn phone calls yesterday seeking comment.   Avrett has won several new pieces of business recently.Last month, it picked up the $45 million Trans World Airlinesaccount, which Young andamp; Rubicam had given up after it said theaccount wasn't profitable. Avrett also picked up fiveAmerican Home Products drug lines -- including the likes ofCompound W wart remover -- with total billings of about $5million. Those accounts may have given Avrett the edge forthe Dimetapp business, agency executives said.   ---   Ad Notes. . . .
