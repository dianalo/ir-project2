(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An unprecedented $580,000 fine imposed ona pillow factory accused of hiring more than 100 illegal aliens ina rural town reflects how shrinking job markets in border stateshave dispersed immigrants, officials said.   The civil fine levied Wednesday against Piedmont Quilting Corp.in Walhalla is the largest imposed by the Immigration andNaturalization Service under a 1986 law that penalizes employerscaught hiring illegal aliens.   The INS also pursued a criminal case, and last week, thecompany, its owners and nine managers were indicted on charges ofillegally recruiting and harboring 117 illegal aliens.   In a July raid, immigration officials said they found 85 illegalaliens from Mexico and Peru working at the plant, including a12-year-old boy earning $4 to $5 an hour doing menial labor. Allwere deported. Subsequent investigation raised the number ofillegal aliens alleged to have been hired at the plant to 117.   Walhalla, population 4,000, is near Sumter National Forest,about 15 miles from the Georgia and North Carolina borders innorthwestern South Carolina.   Police Chief John Gillespie said he contacted the INS afterseveral plant workers stopped for traffic violations and otherminor offenses could not produce proper identification.   Fred Alexander, deputy district director of the INS regionaloffice in Atlanta, said the agency tends to focus enforcementefforts on urban areas, ``where we feel they are likely to do themost good.''   But while the Walhalla raid was unusual, it may be readilyexplained by economic trends, beginning with depressed job marketsin Texas and Louisiana.   ``People are traveling east for jobs and this particular groupfound them in Walhalla,'' Alexander said.   The INS does not plan to concentrate on the Southeast's textileindustry in the wake of the Piedmont Quilting case, Alexander said.   ``I think it is by far and away the exception rather than therule,'' said Frederick B. Dent Jr., president of the 80-memberSouth Carolina Textile Manufacturers Association.   Dent, who also is president of Mayfair Mills in Arcadia, saideven though his company cannot find enough workers, it would notresort to hiring illegal aliens.   ``We would rather have jobs go unfilled than to break the lawand incur the penalties and the public disgrace the Piedmontproblem brought,'' Dent said.   ``You hear of those things in New York and Texas and borderstates but it's the first time I've heard of it here,'' said JamesWalsh, president-elect of the South Carolina Needle TradesAssociation and manager of Lexington Sportswear. ``I think it's anisolated incident.''   However, possible violators of the 1986 immigration law``probably have more of a likelihood of not being discovered'' inthe South because the INS' main resources and personnel are inTexas and California, said Donald A. Young, officer in charge ofthe agency's office in Charlotte, N.C.   In the indictment handed up Tuesday in Greenville, PiedmontQuilting owner Alfred Mizhir, 55, and his wife, Gail Mizhir, 30,both of Spring Lake, N.J., face possible prison terms of 653 yearsand fines totaling $5.1 million if convicted on all charges.   The nine other indicted company managers or officers also eachface up to 653 years in prison if convicted.   The criminal charges resulted from a six-month investigationthat included the use of an undercover INS agent who posed as aplant worker, immigration officials said.   INS officials reported working conditions were unsafe forchildren, who were confronted by large machinery and 150-poundbales of fabric used to make pillows, quilts and comforters.   The administrative fine also covers the company's failure tocomply with procedures to verify that the plant's more than 400employees were not illegal aliens, INS officials said.   The company, which has 30 days to contest the civil fine, hasrefused to comment. Attorney Bill Bannister, who representsPiedmont Quilting, did not return calls to his office Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
