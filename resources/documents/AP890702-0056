In the West Bank, a 12-year-old Palestinian was shot and killedin a clash between troops and stone-throwing Arabs. Twelve Arabswere reported wounded in other incidents.   The death raised to 539 the number of Palestinians killed in the18-month revolt against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and GazaStrip. Twenty-three Israelis also have died.   In another development, a report on Israel radio's Englishservice said Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told Sunday's Cabinetmeeting that ``the Justice Ministry had authorized the use ofplastic bullets against any Arab male in the (occupied) territorieswhose face was masked.''   The report did not elaborate and it was not carried on anysubsequent Israel radio broadcasts Sunday night.   An official in the Defense Ministry, speaking on condition ofanonymity, would neither confirm nor deny the report, but he saidthe Defense Ministry asked the Justice Ministry last month toliberalize orders to open fire.   The official said the military asked permission to shoot themasked leaders of violent demonstrations with sometimes lethalplastic-tipped bullets ``under very, very, special circumstances.''He did not specify the circumstances.   If the measures were approved in principle by the JusticeMinistry, the ministry would then decide under what conditions themilitary could open fire and the Defense Ministry would then issuenew orders, the spokesman said.   An army spokesman said no such orders have been issued.   Under current regulations, soldiers may only open fire atPalestinians who are building roadblocks or preparing to attacksoldiers or if their lives are in danger, the army spokesman said.   Many Palestinian protesters mask their faces in Arab keffiyehs,or headdresses.   The Palestinian condemnation of the United States came in aleaflet by the Unified National Leadership of the Uprising. It noted``the deteriorating economic situation'' in Israel and called for afurther boycott of Israeli products.   For the first time, uprising leaders called for a two-day strikeamong the 810,000 Israeli Arabs and urged them to ``provide materialaid and food'' to their brethren in the occupied lands.   Radical Palestinian groups have recently increased their effortsaimed at inciting Israeli Arabs, who live among the 3.5 millionJews, to take a more active role in the uprising. Some Israeli Arabshave staged sympathy strikes.   The leaflet criticized the U.S. position as ``always biasedtoward the Zionist enemy and supportive of the elections underoccupation,'' and it praised European countries for supporting aU.N.-sponsored peace conference with the participation of thePalestine Liberation Organization.   The leaflet came as President Bush reportedly reassured PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir of his support for Shamir's peace plan,which calls for balloting in the occupied territories andnegotiations with elected Palestinians on limited self-rule.Uprising leaders reject the plan because it does not call for anindependent Palestinian state.   Israel radio said the backing came in a letter, but Shamir'sspokesman, Avi Pazner, said the letter had not been received.   The daily Haaretz newspaper reported Bush was angry over Shamir'ssupport for building Jewish settlements in the occupied territories,which run counter to U.S. policy calling for Israel to give up landin exchange for peace.   Haaretz quoted Bush as saying ``I don't understand this Shamir''as he banged his palm on a table at a meeting in Washington. Thepaper said the session was attended by Sen. Daniel Inoyue, D-Hawaii,and Seymour Reich, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of MajorJewish Organizations.   The fatal clash Sunday broke out when troops ``encounteredviolent resistance'' as they entered the village of Idna to arrestsuspects, an army spokesman said. He said the army was investigatingthe circumstances of the youth's death.   The victim, identified as Khalil Awad Tabran, was shot in thechest, said officials at Alia Hospital in nearby Hebron.   Twelve Palestinians were wounded Sunday by army gunfire,including a 24-year-old woman listed in critical condition with agunshot wound to the chest, Arab hospital officials said. An armyspokesman confirmed two of the wounded.   About 30 Israeli mayors chained themselves outside Shamir'soffice Sunday to protest unemployment, which has reached 8.6 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
