Authorities in Washington, Boston and Philadelphia stepped upefforts to get homeless people into warm shelter. At least 11deaths were blamed on the weather during the weekend.   Pre-dawn temperatures at Albany, N.Y., were in the singledigits, but 25 mph wind made it feel like 30 degrees below zero,the National Weather Service said.   ``This is our first real arctic air outbreak of the season,''said meteorologist Al Moore of the weather service at Newark, N.J.,where it was 15 degrees Monday.   But relief was on the way with a warm front sweeping across theMidwest. At midday, temperatures across Illinois ranged from 32 onthe Chicago lakefront to 51 at Belleville, near St. Louis, Mo. Andin the Pacific Northwest, the problem was melting snow and heavyrain that threatened floods and caused mudslides, one of whichpushed a van off a busy road east of Seattle.   Temperatures hit record lows Monday all across Florida,including 47 at Miami, 39 at Fort Myers, 33 at Tampa, 40 at St.Petersburg and 27 at Apalachicola.   Most of Alabama had record lows, including 25 at the Gulf ofMexico port of Mobile. In Mississippi, Jackson and Meridian eachhit a record low of 20.   But Florida citrus growers welcomed the weather.   ``Actually, a cold snap like this can be quite beneficial,''said Bill Becker, chairman of the Florida Citrus Commission.Temperatures in the 30s accelerate citrus growth and put the treesinto a dormant phase, which give them greater resistance to cold inthe future, he said.   Amtrak reported delays of two hours Monday on trains between NewYork and Washington because of weather-related problems in a fiberoptics cable which handles switches, said spokeswoman Sue Martin.Temporary repairs were made by afternoon.   Shelters for the homeless were full overnight in the District ofColumbia. And officials said two vans were on the street overnightto provide warm food and drinks to homeless people who eithercouldn't find shelter or refused to go indoors.   Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis on Friday announced theopening of a 200-bed shelter at a Newton armory after renovations.John Rood said the 730-bed Pine Street Inn in Boston was fullSunday, with some people staying in the lobby. ``On any givennight, we are serving 1,000 people,'' Rood said.   A low of 18 and wind chill of minus 10 to minus 25, plus alreadycrowded shelters, forced Philadelphia officials to add 125 beds forthe homeless, to a total of 2,975.   A ferocious weekend snowstorm in northern Maine left Caribouunder 21 inches of fresh snow, for a total depth of 30 inches, andhigh wind Monday caused widespread drifting.   Commuters in the area apparently heeded the cue to stay home,said state police, who reported almost empty highways.   Schools were closed in two counties of West Virginia, where theremote community of Pickens, at an elevation of 3,500 feet, got 14inches of snow.   ``We're real used to it here,'' said Jim Biggs, a high schoolprincipal and teacher.   Lake-effect storms fed by moisture from Lake Erie moderatedafter blanketing western New York. West Valley, south of Buffalo,received 18 inches and nearby Chaffee got 15 inches, with 20- to30-mph wind piling drifts up to 3 feet high, the weather servicesaid.   Squalls produced up to a foot of snow in northeastern Ohio andin western Pennsylvania.   The cold was blamed for the deaths of one homeless man inSpringfield, Mass., one in Philadelphia and two in St. Paul, Minn.   The weather was blamed for at least three deaths on New Yorkstate roads and investigators blamed an overheated wood stove for afire that killed three people in Chautauqua County. One person waskilled in a crash on an icy Montana road.</TEXT></DOC>
