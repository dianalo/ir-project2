Trying to use conventionalscheduling to unload 16,000 trains per year, or up to 75 trains per day,bringing 70 grades of coal and at the same time shipping 100 differentblends would have resulted in large delays for the railroad or ships,or both. Hence, the authors decided to create a system, the first ofits type, that could work without scheduling, by accommodating and randoncombination of input and output. This system can simultaneously unloadup to three trains and load up to three ships. When allowance is madefor the substantial amount of time traditionally lost in Australia inlabor disputes, achieving an annual throughput capacity of 55 milliontons translates into a required total train (three trains simultaneously)peak unloading rate of 22,000 TPH and total peak shiploading rate (threeships) of 35,000 TPH. The train unloading, stacking, reclaiming and shiploadingrates needed to attain this performance are unprecedented. It shouldbe noted that the value of operating with less staff and avoiding dirt,noise or manual labor is far greater in Australia than in the UnitedStates. Thus, it was important and economical to achieve the higheststandards of reliability, simplicity, maintenance access, and virtualelimination of spillage and ease of cleanup. This paper describes thehigh capacity coal handling system designed in accordance with the aboveobjectives.</TEXT></DOC>
