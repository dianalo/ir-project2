A spokesman for Chatsworth, Calif.-based Computer Memories said the agreement fell through because of market weakness in animated programming for children, but said the cancellation was &quot;no reflection&quot; on Burbank, Calif.-based DIC or its management.    Frederic Heim, Computer Memories' senior vice president and chief financial officer, said some of Computer Memories' major shareholders objected to the agreement. DIC officials declined to comment.    Computer Memories' stock closed at $1.625, down 31.25 cents, in national over-the-counter trading yesterday.    Computer Memories stopped its principal business of making disk drives in 1986. Its main assets are about $24.6 million in cash and equivalents. </TEXT></DOC>
