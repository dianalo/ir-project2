Background</ITAG>Section 301(a) of the Clean Water Act (the Act) provides that the dischargeof pollutants is unlawful except in accordance with an NPDES permit. EPA'sregulations authorize the issuance of general permits to categories ofdischarges when a number of point sources are: 1. Located within the same geographic area and warrant similar pollutioncontrol measures; 2. Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations; 3. Discharge the same types of wastes; 4. Require the same effluent limitations or operating conditions; 5. Require the same or similar monitoring requirements; and 6. In the opinion of the Director, are more appropriately controlled undera general permit than under individual permits. Like individual permits, a violation of a condition contained in a generalpermit constitutes a violation of the Clean Water Act and subjects theowner or operator of the permitted facility to the penalties specifiedin section 309 of the Act. Owners or operators authorized by a general permit may request to be excludedfrom coverage by this general permit by applying to the Director for anindividual permit. This request must be made by submitting an NPDES permitapplication, together with supporting documentation for the request nolater than 90 days after publication by EPA of the final general permitin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, or 180 days prior to the commencement of operationof a new source or new discharger. <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Seafood Processors in Alaska </ITAG>As of January 1989, the existing seafood general permit has covered 243seafood processors (165 are mobile and 78 are shore-based). The draft permitproposed for reissuance is to expand coverage to include many more processorsthroughout Alaska. EPA now proposes to cover an estimated additional 150of those currently not covered under any NPDES permit. These 150 facilitiesare small, mobile processing vessels that discharge more than \1/2\ milefrom shore in open water. at a depth of at least 42 feet. These facilitieswere excluded from coverage under the the existing general permit. Theywere consequently required to apply for an individual NPDES permit. Inorder to reduce the regulatory burden on these facilities, EPA proposesto cover them under the reissued permit. This will increase total coveragestatewide under the general permit to about 400 facilities.  The following areas are excluded from coverage under the proposed reissuedgeneral permit: 1. Akutan: Akutan Harbor, if the amount of waste exceeds 310,000 poundsper month.  2. Kodiak: Gibson Cove, Near Island Channel, St. Paul Harbor, and Women'sBay. 3. Unalaska/Dutch Harbor:<ITAG tagnum="15">Iliuliuk Bay, Iliuliuk Harbor, Dutch Harbor, and Captain's Bay. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Unalaska Bay, south of the northermost point of Hog Island.</ITAG>4. Discharges in the following areas:  a. Areas where water depth is less than 42 feet which are likely to havepoor flushing (bays, harbors, inlets, coves, and lagoons that are protected). b. Areas of special concern (spawning areas, State Critical Habitats andRefuges, National Wildlife Refuges, and the seaward boundaries of WildernessRefuges, National Parks and Monuments, and wilderness classified lands).5. Discharges to fresh waters in the vicinity of drinking water sources.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Effluent Limitations  </ITAG>1. Size of Waste Particles  In compliance with BCT for remote Alaska processors, seafood wastes maybe discharged only if they do not exceed 0.5 inch in any dimension.   2. Discharge DepthThe permit specifies that process wastes shall be discharged through anoutfall located beneath the mean lower low water (MLLW) level of the receivingwater surface at a point which provides maximum dispersion of the wastes.The discharged depth for shore-based processing facilities must be at least10 feet, into a total depth to the bottom substrate of 20 feet at MLLW.On a case by case basis, EPA may grant waiver of the depth requirement,provided adequate justification for the waiver is submitted by the permitteein the Notice of Intent to be Covered. 3. Treatment of Sanitary Wastes The permit requires that all sanitary wastes generated at a facility be: a. Discharged to a septic system or a municipal treatment works, or  b. Treated prior to discharge by an approved marine sanitation device thatcomplies with pollution control standards and regulations under section312 of the Act, or c. Treated to meet the secondary treatment effluent limitations.   4. Prohibition of the Discharge of GarbageThis permit prohibits the discharge of garbage (especially plastics) fromseafood processing facilities. 5. Prohibition of Discharges from Docked Vessels  This general permit prohibits the discharge of pollutants from vesselsdocked at or otherwise tied up to the permittee's facility. 6. State of Alaska Water Quality Standards  Based on the State of Alaska Water Quality Standards, there shall be nodischarge of floating solids, grease, oily water or wastes that producea sheen on the surface of the receiving water, or foam that persists ator near the shoreline and/or impacts nearby shoreline activities. In addition,no wastes shall be allowed to accumulate on the shore.  <ITAG tagnum="84">D. Monitoring Requirements  </ITAG>1. Dive Surveys  Most facilities covered by this permit will be required to conduct twodive surveys in the first year of coverage. Dive surveys are required inorder to document any negative impacts resulting from the discharge ofseafood wastes.       If dive surveys indicate the presence of a year-round waste pile accumulation,a request for a state-designated zone of deposit shall be submitted within30 days of the second dive survey.Facilities discharging to the following receiving waters will be requiredto conduct two dive surveys per year, based on the higher concentrationof large facilities in these areas: Unalaska Bay, Akutan Harbor, WrangellNarrows, and Orca Inlet.2. Other Monitoring RequirementsFacilities that are exempt from the dive survey requirement (due to a prohibitivedepth of the outfall or hazardous diving conditions) are required to conductbottom samples to document any waste pile accumulations. Facilities arerequired to conduct bottom samples twice in the first year of coverage.Facilities on the Kenai River, Kasilof River, and fresh waters are requiredto conduct annual bottom samples.Annual dye testing of the wastehandling system is required for facilitiesthat do not have annual dive requirements to insure proper operation ofthe outfall as well as the collection system over the life of the permit.The permit requires effluent sampling for total residual chlorine to assesspotential impacts to the receiving water. Most facilities chlorinate intakewater prior to processing for disinfection purposes.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. Reporting Requirements</ITAG>The permittees will be required to submit to EPA and ADEC the following:1. Notice of Intent to be CoveredExisting facilities covered under this general permit must notify the Directorof their intent to be covered no later than 30 days after permit reissuance.For new dischargers, the intent must be submitted 30 days prior to commencementof operations.The Notice of Intent to be Covered must include the following information:a. NPDES permit number previously assigned State seafood processors permitnumber.b. Owner: name, address, phone number.c. Operator: name, address, phone number.d.

Treatment: method of treating seafood and sanitary wastes, method ofgarbage/plastics disposal, depth of discharge below the water surface,total water column depth at the discharge location, water use diagram (estimatesof flows used in seafood processing, sanitary systems, freezing, etc.)f. Receiving Water(s): name of receiving water(s), bathymetric map of receivingwater showing the outfall location (shore-based and near-shore facilitiesonly).g. Production Data: (for each type of raw product processed), Name of rawproduct, Type of finished product, Maximum quantity processed per day,Projected dates of each operating season, Projected number of processingdays per season.Submittal (to EPA) of the State of Alaska Department of Environmental ConservationAnnual Uniform Permit Application for Seafood Processors, if it includesall of the information above, will also satisfy this requirement.2. Annual ReportThe Annual Report shall be submitted by the end of the processing seasonor by January 31 of each year, whichever is sooner, and shall include thefollowing:a. Dive or Bottom Sampling Reports.b. Residual Chlorine Monitoring Results.c. Dye Test Results.d. Production Data for the previous year (a copy of the daily records willsuffice) including, for each location: Dates of operations at each location,production data (raw and finished product for each type of product), anda map showing the bathymetry at each location (when locations are within\1/2\ mile of shore or in less than 90 feet of total water depth).e. Updated Notice of Intent to be Covered. Any changes to the informationsubmitted in the original Notice of Intent to be Covered. f. Special Reporting Requirements in Areas of Concern: Facilities dischargingto Unalaska Bay, Akutan Harbor, Wrangell Narrows, and Orca Inlet shallsubmit monthly Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs). <ITAG tagnum="84">F. Other Legal Requirements </ITAG>1. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)Pursuant to section 301 of the Clean Water Act, new source performancestandards were pomulgated by EPA in 1975 for categories of discharges coveredunder this permit. In accordance with section 511(c)(1) of the Act, NPDESpermits for new sources are subject to the provisions of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act (NEPA). An assessment of potentially significant impacts onthe quality of the human environment resulting from operation of the newsource is required under NEPA. Prior to the issuance of the existing general permit. EPA conducted anenvironmental assessment to determine if the environmental impacts associatedwith the discharges from new sources operating under the permit would besignificant. On December 1, 1983, EPA determined that the environmentalimpacts would not be significant and issued a Finding of No SignificantImpact (FONSI). Because the proposed general permit will also allow coverageto new source seafood processors, EPA has reexamined the environmentalassessment in relation to the conditions of the proposed general permit.Because there have been no significant changes in the fundamental factorsaffecting the facilities covered by the general permit and the waters itis designed to protect, EPA has determined that the permit will not causeany significant environmental impacts. Although the proposed permit coversmore Alaskan waters than the existing permit, additional monitoring requirementsin areas of concern have been incorporated into the proposed permit (suchas more frequent dive surveys in Orca Inlet). These requirements are derivedfrom current individual permitting policies in these areas. The reissued permit continues to allow EPA to issue individual permitsto facilities if water quality is not adequately protected under the generalpermit. Individual environmental assessments will be prepared for new sourcesnot covered under this proposed general permit. Based on the above factors, EPA has determined that the environmental assessmentand Finding of No Significant Impact prepared for the existing permit arestill valid for the purposes of this permit reissuance. 2. Paperwork Reduction Act EPA has reviewed the requirements imposed on regulated facilities by thisproposed general permit under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>The information collection requirements of this permithave already been approved by the Office of Management and Budget in submissionsmade for the NPDES permit program under the Clean Water Act. 3. Executive Order 12291 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from the reviewrequirements of Executive Order 12291 pursuant to section 8(b) of thatorder. <ITAG tagnum="84">4. Regulatory Flexibilty Act </ITAG>After review of the facts presented in the notice printed above, I herebycertify pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this generalNPDES permit will not have a significant impact on a substantial numberof small entities. Moreover, the permit reduces a significant administrativeburden on regulated sources. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated; May 10, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robie G.
