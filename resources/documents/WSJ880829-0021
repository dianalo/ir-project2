But the PTA opposes the bill because it would use vouchers to fund day care and would &quot;create excessive entanglement between church and state.&quot;    Business generally fears such legislation would mean more intrusions by big government. But American Express Corp., along with some other companies, backs the measure as a way to provide national standards for quality child care for employees.    And while Republicans and Democrats scramble to find common ground to pass politically popular child care legislation, groups that usually won't talk to each other have problems with the bill. They include the American Civil Liberties Union, Phyllis Schlafly's conservative Eagle Forum, the American Jewish Committee and the National Education Association as well as the national parent-teacher association.    Finally, the key lawmaker working with a liberal Democrat to push through a compromise bill is conservative Sen. Orrin Hatch, (R., Utah), who just four years ago declared that the federal government had no business directly financing child care.    Right now, it is questionable that an agreement on a bill can be reached before the current Congress ends in October. But the issue isn't going away. Both presidential candidates vow to make increased child care a major family issue, though they differ on how best to go about it.    Michael Dukakis has endorsed in concept the Democratic-sponsored bill, nicknamed ABC, that would authorize distribution of $2.5 billion to the states. The bill would establish and expand child care facilities nationally, and subsidize day-care costs for low-income and middle-class working families. The measure also would create a national advisory committee to establish minimum health and safety regulations for all publicly assisted day-care centers and family day-care homes.    George Bush has his own child care proposal. He has proposed a $2.2 billion plan to give low-income families, including those where mothers stay at home, a $1,000 refundable tax credit for each child under age four. Republicans have been pushing for tax credits as part of the current congressional legislation.    Efforts in Congress to reach agreement on a final bill have run into snags. A key one is a dispute over religion. Churches provide about one-third of day care in this country overall, and a much higher ratio in some communities. The original bill would have barred funds to church day-care facilities for a variety of reasons.    After much debate the rules were loosened. The legislation now would allow churches to receive federal funds if the money isn't used for religious activities. Churches couldn't discriminate against who they admit to day-care slots funded by federal dollars, but they could set aside slots that aren't government-funded. There also wouldn't be any bar, as there was in the original bill, against hiring discrimination based on religion.    The religious issue has proved a lightning rod for groups such as the ACLU, which believes that public funding of religious institutions violates the constitutional separation of church and state. Now some groups that originally supported the bill are reconsidering.    Decrying the move to allow religious discrimination in hiring and some admissions, Judith Golub, an official of the American Jewish Committee, charges that &quot;you can't make good policy with a bad law.&quot; Michael Edwards, congressional relations manager at the National Education Association, says the NEA wants &quot;substantial changes&quot; in the bill &quot;to get it closer to where it originally was.&quot;    Adding to the turmoil is a feud between the NEA and some of the child care bill's supporters. The NEA's critics charge the teachers' union wants the focus more on day care in public schools rather than in churches because it has wide influence in many public-school systems. The issue for the NEA is &quot;who's going to control the money and the delivery system,&quot; Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, charged recently. &quot;It's really sad when we were expecting to be fighting (the Rev. Jerry) Falwell and Schlafly, that we are fighting the NEA.&quot; (The NEA brands such charges &quot;nonsense.&quot;)    &quot;Child care is an urgent need,&quot; declares Ms. Edelman, who says the religious provision is a &quot;moderate compromise&quot; backed by &quot;the overwhelming majority&quot; of the leading coalition of supporters. Joseph L. Rauh Jr., the longtime liberal Washington lawyer, wrote a letter to House Labor Committee Chairman Augustus Hawkins, (D., Calif.), arguing that the bill is &quot;consistent with the letter and spirit of the civil rights protections for which we struggled together.&quot;    With time running out in the current Congress, the prospects for child care legislation this year are considered to be dim if not dead. The remaining effort involves the once unlikely help of Sen. Hatch, who revised his views on child care because of the increasing number of women in the workplace.    Mr. Hatch is working with liberal Sen. Christopher Dodd, (D., Conn.), the chief sponsor of the Senate legislation, to forge a compromise on the bill before it reaches the Senate floor. A compromise could solidify bipartisan support, put pressure on the House and maybe even sway the White House against a veto, experts say. &quot;Whatever we do,&quot; Mr. Hatch says, &quot;is going to be costly.&quot;    ---              Changes in the ABC Child Care Bill                 To Deal With Church-Day Care   How the bill originally treated church-based day care   -- No funds could be spent on any activity that advanced or promoted religion   -- Religious symbols and artifacts had to be covered or removed from any day-care space   -- No day-care services could be performed by people otherwise employed as teachers or aides in a sectarian institution   -- No funds could be spent on capital improvements to sectarian institutions   -- No child care provider could discriminate against children in admissions decisions or engage in employment discrimination   How the bill now treats church-based day care   -- No funds can be spent on any sectarian purpose or activity, including sectarian worship and instruction   -- No funds can be used to discriminate against children in admission decision</TEXT></DOC>
