Mr. Stern's show, which is syndicated nationally, features bawdy humor and double entendres. &quot;Some of his material constitutes actionable indecency,&quot; said Diane Killory, the FCC's general counsel. &quot;Today, we're warning. Tomorrow (if he continues), we'll impose a more severe sanction -- namely a fine.&quot; She said the agency could impose fines of as much as $2,000 a broadcast for indecent programming.    The FCC's warning came as a surprise. In the past, the agency has moved gingerly in enforcing statutes banning the broadcast of obscene or indecent speech. &quot;We declare our determination to apply a broader definition&quot; of indecency, said Dennis Patrick, an FCC commissioner who takes over as chairman today.    Last fall, the FCC, under pressure from anti-pornography crusaders, launched its first obscenity investigations in nine years. Yesterday, the agency voted 5-0 to warn three radio stations -- Infinity Broadcasting Corp.'s WYSP-FM in Philadelphia, which carries the Howard Stern show; Pacifica Foundation Inc.'s KPFK-FM in Los Angeles and the University of California's KCSB-FM in Santa Barbara -- that they had carried indecent programming.    At a New York news conference, Mr. Stern said he has been &quot;vindicated&quot; by the FCC action, noting he received no fine or license revocation. A spokesman for Infinity Broadcasting described the FCC's finding as &quot;a warning to all broadcasters.&quot; He said if the FCC issued new rulings concerning obscenity, Infinity would review Mr. Stern's program at that time. &quot;They can't stop Howard from doing what he is doing,&quot; calling the Stern broadcast &quot;consistent&quot; with past FCC rulings.    The FCC said it didn't impose fines because it first wanted to alert broadcasters it was changing its enforcement policy. For the past decade, the agency has said indecency laws bar only broadcasts that constantly repeat curse words. Now, the agency said, it has broadened its interpretation to also ban offensive references to sexual conduct.    Bradley Curl, national director of Morality in Media Inc., a conservative advocacy group, lauded the agency &quot;for sending a clear message&quot; to broadcasters to halt offensive broadcasts. He said his group would monitor Mr. Stern's show and complain to the FCC if it violates the broader indecency standard.    But Henry Baumann, general counsel of the National Association of Broadcasters, said he was concerned that the change in enforcement would mean that &quot;broadcasters might not know what they can and can't do.&quot;    In the past, Mr. Baumann said, the FCC didn't object to broadcasts that included sexually suggestive material if the shows were aired after 10 p.m. The assumption was that children wouldn't be listening at that hour. But yesterday, the FCC said it decided against setting any time that indecent language would be acceptable, arguing it was concerned that teen-agers listen to the radio at all hours.    The agency also referred one KPFK show, which featured a play that included homosexual sex fantasies, to the Justice Department for possible obscenity-law violations. FCC Commissioner James Quello called the show &quot;disgustingly obscene.&quot;    But Tarabu Betserai, KPFK's general manager, said the station broadcast a warning before the show began, and ran it at 10 p.m. to keep it from children. &quot;The play revolves around safe-sex in an era of AIDS,&quot; he said. &quot;This isn't an issue of taste; it's an issue of censorship.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
