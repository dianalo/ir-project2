But an X-ray revealed the bones of a1,000-year-old mummy.   Authorities say the remains, packed into a Sears television box,likely belong to member of the ancient Anasazi Indian tribe.Anthropologists and pathologists say the rare find is among thebest preserved they have seen.   Law enforcement officials believe looters carried the mummy fromits burial cave in the desert Southwest, where the Anasazi, or``Ancient Ones,'' farmed and hunted from about 600 A.D. until 1350A.D.   Anthropologists say they are the ancestors of the Hopi andPueblo Indians of today.   Second thoughts and stiff penalties for pilfering Indianartifacts on federal or Indian lands probably led the anonymousfinders to ``donate'' the remains to the museum, University of UtahPolice Chief Wayne Shepherd said.   Museum officials said they intended to give up the remains forreburial. Authorities have contacted state and federal Indianagencies, but no decision has been made on where or how the remainswill be reburied.   Indian tribes strongly oppose allowing such remains to bedisplayed in museums, believing it to be sacrilege. Pressure fromIndian groups recently prompted the Smithsonian Institution inWashington to agree to return its Indian remains to tribes forreburial.   Shepherd said a University of Utah museum secretary received ananonymous telephone call Oct. 11 from a woman who said her husbandhad found a mummy, knew having it was illegal and wondered whetherthe museum wanted it. The caller told the employee to look on theback steps and hung up, Shepherd said.   Police were called and, as a cautionary measure, took X-rays ofthe box to ensure that it didn't contain a bomb. Instead, theX-rays showed vague outlines of a human skeleton.   Utah State Medical Examiner Dr. Todd Grey said he found themummy in ``remarkable'' shape, given its apparent age.   ``It's a very rare find,'' added University of Utahanthropologist John McCullough. ``We have very few specimens ofthat time period available.''   The professor said much valuable data was lost, however, becausethe burial site is unknown.   ``It's unfortunate from two aspects. Foremost is that a burialwas disturbed in a most unceremonious way. It's desecration,'' hesaid. ``Second is that from an archaeological standpoint, whateverinformation we could have gleaned has been largely lost.''   Thousands of ancient Indian dwellings scattered throughout thesouthwestern United States attract artifact hunters. Looting anddamage to potentially significant archaeological sites has led tolaws prohibiting scavenging on federal lands.   The mummy was folded into a fetal position and covered with awoven robe. Feathers or tufts of rabbit fur covered the lowerextremities. The skull, apparently severed during excavation, wasnestled in polystryrene packing material between the feet.   The torso and legs were covered with a brown, parchment-likeskin. Fingernails and toenails were still evident.   ``We don't see mummified remains that often,'' Grey said. ``Isee homicide victims who have been dead for two or three years andthey're bones.   ``This is a really nice example of what can happen to humanremains in a dry, warm and protected environment,'' he added.   That state of preservation has allowed Grey and McCullough todraw a few conclusions about the mummy, which is believed to bethat of a woman in her 60s.   While the exact age of the remains isn't known, McCulloughestimates it falls somewhere between 800 A.D. and 1200 A.D.   The flattened back of the head suggests the remains are AmericanIndian, since Indians often strapped their infants to flat cradleboards. The size and shape of the skull, and small size of theskeleton, indicate the mummy is probably female, while compressedvertebrae offer clues to her age.</TEXT></DOC>
