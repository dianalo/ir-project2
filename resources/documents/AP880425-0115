Bennett'sreport that American education is doing better but not well enoughmet today with a failing grade from one teachers' union forabsolving the federal government ``from any responsibility forimproving public education.''   Teachers deserve the credit for the academic progress in thefive years since a similar study became a biting critique of U.S.education called ``A Nation At Risk,'' said Mary Hatwood Futrell,president of the National Education Association.   Another teachers' union called the Bennett report ``a mixedbag.''   His report, a follow-up requested by President Reagan for thefifth anniversary of ``A Nation At Risk,'' said that Americanschools ``have begun the long climb back'' but that the nation isstill at risk from an academic system rife with mediocrity andresistant to change.   Bennett says American teen-agers are taking more math, scienceand advanced placement courses, and scoring somewhat higher oncollege-entrance and other tests.   But ``curricular foolishness has not been eliminated fromAmerican high schools,'' he said, and the schools ``are still muchtoo cavalier about homework.''   In his evaluation of the impact of school reform, called``American Education: Making It Work,'' Bennett said:   ``American education has made some undeniable progress in thelast few years. The precipitous downward slide of previous decadeshas been arrested, and we have begun the long climb back toreasonable standards. ...   ``We are doing better than we were in 1983. But we are certainlynot doing well enough. ... We are still at risk.''   Bennett will deliver his report to Reagan in a White Houseceremony Tuesday, the fifth anniversary of the provocative reportby the National Commission on Excellence in Education that warnedof ``a rising tide of mediocrity'' in U.S. schools.   The National Education Association, which is frequently at oddswith Bennett, planned to mark the anniversary Tuesday with aprotest in Lafayette Park across from the White House.   ``I give the report a failing grade,'' said Ms. Futrell, the NEApresident. ``It absolves the federal government from anyresponsibility for improving public education. On the plus side,teachers deserve the credit for the academic progress the studentshave made since 1983.   ``Had it not been for the efforts of Congress, which held backthe tide of budget cuts proposed by the Reagan Administration,''she said, ``schools would have been in much worse shape, whichgives Congress an A.''   ``Its a mixed bag,'' said Jane Usdan, spokeswoman for theAmerican Federation of Teachers. ``He highlights what happened overthe last five years, that there's been a lot of good, includingincreases in teachers' salaries and standards that have beentightened.''   But, she said, there's a lot that needs still to be done and``the question is whether these kinds of reforms are going to dothe job that's needed.''   Bennett said too many students drop out, ``and too many of thosewho do graduate have been poorly educated. Our students know toolittle, and their command of essential skills is too slight.   ``Good schools for disadvantaged and minority children are muchtoo rare. ... An ethos of success is missing from too many Americanschools,'' he said. ``Our teachers and principals are too oftenhired and promoted in ways that make excellence a matter of chance,not design.''   Bennett called anew for merit pay for teachers; wider choice inpublic education for parents; stronger curricula at all levels, andstricter accountability for educators, including freedom for localschools to hire the best and fire the worst teachers and principals.   He said a forthcoming National Assessment of EducationalProgress report indicates 9- and 17-year-olds improved theirperformance in math between 1982 and 1986, while 13-year-olds heldsteady.   Another National Assessment will show that in those same years,``17-year-old science students made up nearly all the ground lostsince the 1977 assessment,'' he said.   A new federal study indicated that 12.7 percent of last year'shigh school seniors completed all the courses recommended in ``ANation At Risk:'' four years of English; three years each of math,science and social studies; a half-year of computer science and,for the college-bound, two years of foreign language.   By comparison, fewer than 2 percent of graduates in the Class of1982 took such a regimen. Researchers reviewed the transcripts of15,000 graduates from each year.   The same study indicated fewer students are drifting into lessrigorous ``general tracks'' in high school. Only 17 percent were ona ``general track'' in 1987, down from 35 percent in 1982.   But American students still are humbled by internationalcomparisons, including a recent science assessment that foundAmerican 10-year-olds were average, ``but our 14-year-olds are farbehind their peers around the world, placing 14th out of 17countries,'' Bennett said.   He took a slap at what he called the Chicken Littles who believethat ``some children can't learn because their color, class orfamily background gets in th way.''   Bennett said minorities already comprise 28 percent of America'sschool-age population. ``Apocalyptic analyses and Chicken Littlestories about an onrushing wave of `unteachable' students should berejected,'' he said.   ``Above all, sound education reforms are threatened by thedetermined opposition they elicit,'' Bennett said, pointing to``what might be called opposition by extortion, the false claimthat to fix our schools will first require a fortune in newfunding.''   Bennett's predecessor, T.H. Bell, who commissioned ``A Nation AtRisk,'' has accused the president of failing to provide strongleadership for school reform.   Bell and such groups as the Carnegie Foundation for theAdvancement of Teaching and the Committee for Economic Developmenthave warned in recent months that school reform is not working inAmerica's largely minority inner-city school systems.   Bennett, however, said ``achievement can be torpedoed by theidea that it is mostly a matter of luck, wealth or native ability _an idea altogether too prevalent in American education today.''   Bennett said average teacher salaries, after inflation, haverisen from $23,451 in 1982-83 to an estimated $28,300 today, nearlya 21 percent rise, and more college students are expressinginterest in the profession. But ``until good teachers are paid morethan bad ones, our efforts to improve teaching and learning will befrustrated.''   He complained that there are more penalties ``for serving up asingle rotten hamburger in a restaurant than for repeatedlyfurnishing a thousand children with a rotten education.''   ``We urgently need to improve our methods for locating able andtalented teachers and administrators, for encouraging and promotingthem, and for penalizing those who consistently fail to do theirjob,'' he said.   ``Accountability is the linchpin of education reform.''</TEXT></DOC>
