These statutory changes include:A modified formula grant fund allocation minimum for participating Statesand Territories; a funding pass-through requirement for Indian tribes;a plan requirement related to assessing and addressing the overrepresentationof minority juveniles in all types of secure facilities; extension through1993 of the non-MSA exception to the jail and lockup removal requirement;an alternative substantial compliance standard for jail and lockup removal;and, a provision for the Administrator to waive termination of fundingeligibility for States that have failed to achieve substantial or fullcompliance with the jail and lockup removal requirement. The proposed regulationdetails revised procedures and requirements for States participating inthe Formula Grants Program resulting from the 1988 amendments to the JJDPAct.<ITAG tagnum="84">Description of Major Changes</ITAG>Formula Grant AllocationsSection 222(a) of the JJDP Act was amended to raise the minimum FormulaGrant allocation from $225,000 per State and $56,250 per Territory. Theminimum allocations are now $325,000 per State and $75,000 per Territoryif the title II appropriation is less than $75 million (other than partD). If the title II appropriation is more than $75 million (other thanpart D), the minimum allocations are $400,000 per State and $100,000 perTerritory. State and Territory allocations will be reduced prorata to theextent necessary to ensure that no State receives less than it was allottedin Fiscal Year 1988.Indian Pass-ThroughSection 223(a)(5) of the JJDP Act was amended to require that a portionof each participating State's 66\2/3\ percent Formula Grant pass-throughbe made available to fund programs of Indian tribes that perform law enforcementfunctions, and that agree to attempt to comply with the deinstitutionalizationof status offenders, separation, and jail and lockup removal requirementsof the JJDP Act. The proportion of pass-through funds made available forthese programs must be the same as that proportion of the State's populationunder 18 years of age which resides in those geographical areas where Indiantribes perform such law enforcement functions. Each year, the Secretaryof the Interior will provide OJJDP with an updated list of those tribeswithin States that perform law enforcement functions. The initial listwill be published as an appendix to the Final Regulation.A related provision, section 223(a)(8)(A) of the JJDP Act, was amendedto require that each State's juvenile crime analysis, which is submittedannually as part of the Formula Grant Application and Plan, include anassessment of juvenile crime problems and prevention needs within the geographicalareas in which Indian tribes perform law enforcement functions. Minority Overrepresentation in Secure Facilities Section 223(a)(23) of the JJDP Act was amended to require that each participatingState's Formula Grant Plan address efforts to reduce the proportion ofjuveniles who are members of minority groups detained or confined in securedetention facilities, secure correctional facilities, jails, and lockups,if such proportion exceeds the proportion such groups represent in thegeneral population. Pursuant to section 223(a)(8) of the JJDP Act, and the 1988-1990 FormulaGrants Application Kit, States are required to collect and analyze a broadrange of juvenile crime data. Jail Removal Section 223(a)(14) of the JJDP Act was amended to continue the non-MSA(low population density) exception to the jail and lockup removal requirementthrough 1993. The statutory criteria outlined in section 223(a)(14) (A),(B) and (C) that must be satisfied for a State to use this exception remainthe same (28 CFR 31.303(f)(4)). Section 223(c) of the JJDP Act was amended to create an alternative substantialcompliance standard for those states unable to achieve a 75 percent reductionin jail and lockup removal violations, but which nevertheless have madesufficient progress to merit continued funding. The new standard establishesfour criteria which, if satisfied, may be used in lieu of achieving a 75percent numerical reduction to demonstrate substantial compliance. Thefour criteria require that the State has: (1) Removed all status and nonoffenderjuveniles from adult jails and lockups; (2) made meaningful progress inremoving other juveniles from adult jails and lockups; (3) diligently carriedout the State's jail and lockup removal plan; and (4) has historicallyexpended and continues to expend an appropriate and significant share ofFormula Grant resources to comply with section 223(a)(14) of the JJDP Act.As with the 75 percent reduction standard, for a State to be eligible fora finding of substantial compliance under this alternative standard theState must demonstrate an unequivocal commitment to achieving full compliancewithin a reasonable time, not to exceed three additional years, after theDecember 8, 1985, statutory deadline for achieving substantial compliancewith the jail and lockup removal requirement. The statutory deadlines for substantial and full compliance with section223(a)(14) of the JJDP Act were <T3>not </T3>changed by the 1988 Amendments. Each participating State andTerritory's 1987 and 1988 Monitoring Reports (due by December 31, 1987,and December 31, 1988, respectively) must demonstrate either substantialor full compliance with the jail and lockup removal requirement in orderfor the State to be eligible (absent a waiver of termination) for the FY1989 and 1990 Formula Grant awards, respectively. Each participating Stateand Territory's 1989 Monitoring Report (due by December 31, 1989), mustdemonstrate full compliance with section 223(a)(14) in order for the Stateto be eligible (absent a waiver of termination) for the FY 1991 FormulaGrant award, and all subsequent awards. Section 223(c) of the JJDP Act was also amended to provide the Administratorof OJJDP with the discretion to waive termination of funding eligibilityfor those States and Territories that have not achieved substantial orfull compliance with the jail and lockup removal requirement, providedthat the State or Territory agrees to expend all of its Formula Grant resources,except planning and administration, advisory group set aside, and Indiantribe pass-through funds, to achieve compliance with section 223(a)(14).The proposed changes to the Formula Grants Regulation set forth standardsthat a State must demonstrate it meets in order to be considered by theAdministrator for a waiver of the termination sanction. A State which satisfiesthese standards qualifies for a waiver on the basis that: (1) It has madesignificant progress to date; and (2) additional funding is likely to producefurther progress toward compliance. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>This notice does not constitute a ``major'' rule as defined by ExecutiveOrder 12291 because it does not result in: (a) An effect on the economyof $100 million or more, (b) a major increase in any costs or prices, or(c) adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity,or innovation among American enterprises. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>This proposed regulation, if promulgated, will not have a ``significant''economic impact on a substantial number of small ``entities'', as definedby the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.

Paragraph (b) in andSection; 31.301, will be revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(b) Funds for local use. At least two-thirds of the formula grant allocationto the State (other than the section 222(d) State Advisory Group set aside)must be used for programs by local government, local private agencies,and eligible Indian tribes, unless the State applies for and is granteda waiver by the OJJDP. The proportion of pass-through funds to be madeavailable to eligible Indian tribes shall be based upon that proportionof the Indian population under 18 years of age, in those tribes performinglaw enforcement functions, in relation to the states' general youth populationunder 18 years of age. Pursuant to section 223(a)(5)(C) of the JJDP Act,each of the standards set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) (i) through (iii)of this section must be met in order to establish the eligibility of Indiantribes to receive pass-through funds: (1)(i) The tribal entity must be recognized by the Secretary of the Interioras an Indian tribe that performs law enforcement functions as defined inparagraph (b)(2) of this section; (ii) The tribal entity must agree to attempt to comply with the requirementsof section 223(a)(12)(A), (13), and (14) of the JJDP Act; and (iii) The tribal entity must identity the juvenile justice needs to beserved by these funds within the geographical area where the tribe performslaw enforcement functions. (2) ``Law enforcement functions'' are deemed to include those activitiespertaining to crime prevention, control, reduction, or the enforcementof the criminal law, including, but not limited to, police efforts to prevent,control, or reduce crime and delinquency or to apprehend criminal and delinquentoffenders. (3) To carry out this requirement, OJJDP will annually provide each Statewith the most recent Bureau of Census statistics on the number of personsunder age 18 living within the State, and the number of persons under age18 who reside in geographical areas where Indian tribes perform law enforcementfunctions. (4) Pass-through funds available to tribal entities under section 223(a)(5)(C)shall be made available within States to Indian tribes, combinations ofIndian tribes, or to an organization or organizations designated by suchtribe(s), that meet the standards set forth in paragraph (b)(1) (i)-(iii)of this section. Where the relative number of persons under age 18 withina single Indian tribe is too small to warrant an individual subgrant orsubgrants, the State may, after consultation with the eligible tribe(s),make pass-through funds available to a combination of eligible tribes withinthe State, or to an organization or organizations designated by and representinga group of qualifying tribes, or target the funds on larger tribal jurisdictions.(5) Consistent with section 223(a)(4) of the JJDP Act, the State must providefor consultation with Indian tribes or a combination of eligible tribeswithin the State, or an organization or organizations designated by qualifyingtribes, in the development of a State plan which adequately takes intoaccount the juvenile justice needs and requests of those Indian tribeswithin the State. <ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 31.303 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Amended] </ITAG>4.
