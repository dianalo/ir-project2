(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A class in Christian protest where thefinal exam may involve being arrested is teaching prospectivedeacons in the Episcopal Church how to translate their faith intoaction.   ``Primarily, I'm hoping to get across that worship and liturgyare always inherently political because it has to do with orderingof life in the community,'' said the Rev. William Wylie-Kellerman.   The United Methodist pastor from Detroit discussed the course ona recent winter Saturday as he led a half-hour protest at theUniversity of Michigan's School of Public Health, where scientistshave conducted research involving mustard gas and nerve agentweapons.   Even though the class of about 25 members drew little attentionas they sang hymns and read from the Bible, Wylie-Kellerman said theprotest was important.   ``Impact is often more than what is immediately visible,'' hesaid.   The course is offered for credit to students in the Episcopaldeacon program of the Whitaker School of Theology in Detroit, or toanyone else who wants to transform religious beliefs into activism.   Each class includes a Bible study and a protest worship serviceagainst activities such as an institution's military research,weapons construction or investments in South Africa.   The class has been called a course in protest, butWylie-Kellerman refers to it as a liturgical response to militarism.   ``Liturgy is always political because there's a fundamentalpledge of allegiance. Worship and liturgy declare an allegiance tothe sovereignty of the word of God.''   Worship can take on a whole new meaning when a setting changes,he said.   ``The same identical prayer service done in a cathedral, moved tothe gates of Williams International, you're going to hear the callfor repentance in a different way,'' he said, referring to thecruise missile engine plant in Walled Lake where he will conduct aPentecost service May 13.   ``It's the same commitment and allegiance, but it just cuts youdeeper. One of my clearest personal senses involved doing an Eastervigil liturgy at Wurtsmith Air Force Base: cutting the fence andwalking down the runway toward the high-security area, looking downat the B-52s and renouncing Satan, renewing my commitment toChrist.''   Members of the class say public witness is important.   ``We're talking about taking the gospel and trying to live thegospel in such a way that what we do in worship really makes adifference in the way we live our lives,'' said Joan McDonald, ofHuntington Woods. ``We're trying to make a connection between Sundayand the rest of the week.''   ``We need to go out of that beautiful little cocoon (a church)onto the streets where people are killing and raping, making weaponsthat are going to kill. In terms of protest, or marking particularsites, it's making a public witness of our belief.''   ``It's an issue of peace and justice,'' said Dave Carlson, ofMadison Heights, who hopes to become a deacon candidate. ``Bill hastaught me how to relate scripture to contemporary society.''   Wylie-Kellerman's course will conclude in May, when members ofthe class may participate in civil disobedience and could bearrested at Williams International as many other protesters have.   ``We're programmed to feel we don't make a difference. That typeof thinking can immobilize you,'' McDonald said. ``It's good to benurtured within a group, as small as it is.''</TEXT></DOC>
