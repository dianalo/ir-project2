Hull, who has been linked to an illegal arms-supply networkaiding the Nicaraguan rebels, was arrested at his ranch lastThursday. Officials said he also was being investigated on chargesof spying for the U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras.   Attorney Elda Zuniga said Hull, who suffers from diabetes, becameill on Monday and was sent to the infirmary at the San SebastianJail, where he is being held. The jail is in San Jose, the capital.   Hull's condition improved and he was back in his cell Tuesday,Ms. Zuniga said. She did not say why Hull became ill.   Ms. Zuniga said she will ask Judge Leovigildo Rodriguez of the4th Federal District Court to order the proceedings moved to SanCarlos, about 105 miles north of San Jose. Hull's ranch is in nearbyLos Chiles.   The judge will decide on the request during an open hearingscheduled for Friday, Ms. Zuniga said.   The Office of Judicial Investigations acted after residents nearHull's ranch denounced activities by Hull that they believed couldendanger relations with Costa Rica and Nicaragua's leftistSandinista government, an official with the office said.   The Attorney General's Office formally charged Hull on Friday.   Hull, about 69 and a former Indiana resident, has lived in CostaRica for 20 years. Ms. Zuniga said he became a naturalized CostaRican citizen eight years ago, when he moved to Los Chiles.   Ms. Zuniga said she would move for dismissal of the drug chargesbecause they were based on alleged incidents that occurred in 1984,about three years before Costa Rica's legislature approved ananti-narcotics trafficking law upon which the prosecution is based.   ``According to our Constitution, Article 34, no citizen can beaccused of things that occurred before 1987, the year in which thelegislative assembly approved the narcotics law,'' she said.   Hull has denied any drug trafficking connections. He said in 1986that authorities twice raided his home in unsuccessful attempts tofind evidence of gun running and drug smuggling.   Hull has acknowledged permitting the Contras to use his ranchproperty for their activities before the Iran-Contra case broke in1986. In the case, Reagan administration officials sent arms to Iranfor money to be sent to the Contras.   Witnesses testifying before Congress on illegal arms shipments tothe Contras have said Hull's ranch was a way station for gunsmugglers and cocaine traffickers.   Hull was not among 13 men indicted in September in Miami oncharges of running an illegal arms network for the Contras. Reportssaid Hull was granted immunity by the special prosecutor in the case.</TEXT></DOC>
