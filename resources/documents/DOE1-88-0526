In thepresence of fetal calf serum, bone explants were viable in culture bymorphological criteria, and retained large numbers of osteoblasts andosteoclasts. Incorporation of {sup 3}H-proline into collagenase-digestibleprotein (CDP) and non-collagen protein (NCP) was determined using purifiedbacterial collagenase. Collagen accounted for over 10% of the total proteinlabeled. The calcium-regulating hormones, parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitaminD3 (1,25(OH)2D3), caused a dose-dependent inhibition of {sup 3}H-prolineincorporation into CDP. The effective dose range of 1,25(OH)2D3 was 0.1nM to 100 nM, while that of PTH was 1.0 nM to 100 nM. The effect of bothhormones was specific for collagen, since {sup 3}H-proline incorporationinto NCP was unaffected. Hydroxyproline analysis of bone explants andculture medium revealed that both hormones decreased the total hydroxyrolinecontent of the cultures, suggesting that the inhibition of {sup 3}H-prolineincorporation into DCP is due to inhibition of collagen synthesis.</TEXT></DOC>
