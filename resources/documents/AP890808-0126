(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Parents of lawbreaking minors could beplaced in a public stockade under an ordinance adopted by the CityCouncil.   ``Until we introduce shame back in crime and punishment, we'respinning our wheels,'' City Attorney Charles Sidney Gibson said.   The ordinance also requires anyone under 18 must be off thestreets and away from public places and private businesses from 11p.m. to 5:30 a.m. The ordinance was approved unanimously Saturdayfollowing a street fight the night before and an increase in crimeduring the summer.   Parents unable to control their children may sign a statementsaying so and the minors will be considered delinquent and havetheir fate decided by juvenile courts. Those parents will have topay the city $100 for each minor so designated or render 20 hoursof community service.   The parents will also be required to place a placard at theirhomes and display a bumper sticker on their vehicle saying: ``Mychildren are not my responsibility. They are yours.''   Mayor Eugene Farrell said Monday he doubted that the city wouldever use a stockade because the city has none.   The ordinance calls for:   _Misdemeanor charges against parents or guardians of minors``who fail to exercise control'' over their wards after beingwarned that the minor is in violation of the ordinance.   _Minors who violate the provisions to be taken into custody andheld by the police until they are turned over to their parents orguardians.   _Parents of children who violate the ordinance to be fined up to$500, jailed for up to 30 days, and ``placed within stockadedpublic display six hours a day'' but not more than two consecutivedays.   Adults who fail to abide by the ordinance may also have theirphotograph placed in the local weekly newspaper for two weeks. Acaption would read, ``Irresponsible Parent or Custodian,''whichever applies.   Gibson said he was not sure about the constitutionality of thestockade but felt sure the other provisions were constitutional.   Police Chief Jerry Melton said the fight that pushed the CityCouncil into action involved about six young people and adults anddrew 250 onlookers.   Farrell said the ordinance could be lifted if youngsters'conduct improves.   ``Something's got to be done,'' the city attorney said. ``Thereare people in this town afraid to go out of the house. (Youths)curse them (and) steal their checks out of the mailboxes. The olderones will initiate the younger ones by making them steal. If theydon't join the gang, they whip them.''</TEXT></DOC>
