Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates to cleaning apparatus and methods for      removing residual toner and other particles from an image-bearing surface      of an electrostatographic reproduction machine such as a copier or      printer. More particularly, the present invention relates to such an      apparatus and method that is suitable for cleaning and renewing such an      image-bearing surface. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description Relative to the Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  Electrostatographic process reproduction machines such as copiers and      printers for producing copies of an original document are well known. Such      copies typically are produced on suitable receivers through a repeatable      process that normally includes the steps of (1) using electrostatic      charges in some manner to form a latent image on the surface of an      image-bearing member; (2) developing the latent image with developer      material that includes toner particles; (3) transferring the developed      image to a suitable receiver for subsequent fusing; and (4) cleaning the      image-bearing surface thereafter by removing residual toner and other      particles therefrom in preparation for repeating the process steps. </PAR><PAR>  The quality of the copies obtained by repeating these steps depends      significantly on the effectiveness of the cleaning device or apparatus      that is employed for cleaning and preparing the image-bearing surface for      such reuse. Such cleaning and preparation should involve not only removing      the residual toner and other particles left on the image-bearing surface      after the image transfer step, but also renewing such surface by removing      therefrom chemical and/or physical contamination such as scum.      Conventional cleaning apparatus for removing the particles and attempting      to also remove the chemical contamination include, for example, sponge      roller and blade cleaners as disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No.      4,395,113, issued Jul. 26, 1983 in the name of Buchan et al, and blade and      scrubber pad cleaners as disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 3,947,108,      issued Mar. 30, 1976 in the name of Thettu et al. ln the '108 patent the      need for renewing the surface is recognized, and means for doing so are      disclosed including scrubbing or abrading the surface of the image-bearing      member with a scrubbing pad in order to remove film-like contamination      therefrom. The means or apparatus disclosed includes a single cleaning      element such as a blade, and a single abrasive element such as a pad or      roller consisting of fibers made preferably from cotton or from other      fabrics such as felt or polyurethane. Importantly, it is recognized in the      ' 108 patent that such an apparatus may fail to remove the film-like      contamination if not mechanically biased precisely against the      image-bearing surface, or if overbiased it may undesirably abrade such      surface excessively. Given the particular scrubbing materials and method      disclosed in the '108 patent, the apparatus disclosed therein is therefore      likely to suffer from loading imprecision as the surface becomes abraded      or worn out in the process. Additionally, the surface is also likely to      suffer from surface scratches or abrasive marks, both of which can result      from abrading the surface, and are likely to cause defects in the images      produced on such surface. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In accordance with the present invention, a combination apparatus is      provided for cleaning and renewing the image-bearing surface of a moving      image-bearing member of an electrostatographic reproduction machine. The      combination apparatus comprises first means including a cleaning member      for removing residual particles from the image-bearing surface, and second      means which is located relative to the movement of the imaging member      downsteam of the first means, for abrading the image-bearing surface so as      to remove at least an atomic layer of material forming such surface. The      second means includes a first abrading member that has first abrasive      means built therein. The combination apparatus further includes third      means which is located relative to the movement of the imaging member      downstream of said second means for polishing and renewing the abraded      imaging surface so as to substantially erase printable scratches from such      surface. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  In the detailed description of the invention presented below, reference is      made to the drawings, in which. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of an electrostatographic reproduction      machine such as an optical copier including the combination cleaning      apparatus of the present invention; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is an enlarged illustration (partly in section) of the combination      cleaning apparatus of FIG. 1 showing the surface cleaning and renewing      means of the present invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  Because electrostatographic reproduction apparatus are well known, the      present description will be directed in particular to elements forming      part of or cooperating more directly with the present invention. Elements      of such apparatus not specifically shown or described herein are assumed      selectable from those known in the prior art. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 1, an electrostatographic reproduction machine such      as an optical copier is shown generally as 10, and includes an      image-bearing member 11 which has a frontside image-bearing surface 12. As      shown, the member 11 is trained about a series of rollers 13 through 16      for movement in the direction, for example, of the arrow T1. One of the      rollers, such as the roller 13, can be a drive roller, suitably driven by      a conventional drive (not shown) for repeatedly moving the member 11      through a series of electrostatographic process stages shown as AA, BB, CC      and DD. Although the member 11 is shown as an endless flexible web trained      about the series of rollers, it should be understood that a rigid drum,      having an image-bearing surface, can also be used. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 1, clean and charge-free portions of the image-bearing      member 11 for example, initially move through the stage AA where      electrostatic charges and/or light, are used in one manner or another (as      is well known in the art) to electrostatically form latent images of an      original document on the surface 12. Typically, the stage AA includes      contamination sensitive components such as a primary charger 20 or other      charge depositing component (not shown). The electrostatic image of the      original document can thus be formed on the surface 12, for example, by      charging the surface 12 using the primary charger 20, and then image-wise      discharging portions of such surface using an electronic printhead 22      and/or an optical system. A typical optical system has a light source (not      shown) that illuminates a sheet of the original document placed on a      platen such that light rays reflected from the sheet are in turn reflected      by a mirror 24 through a lens 26, to the surface 12 thereby image-wise      exposing or imaging such portion. </PAR><PAR>  The imaged portion of the image-bearing surface 12 next moves to stage BB      where the latent image thereon is developed, that is, is made visible with      charged particles of toner. Stage BB normally includes a development      station 30 that contains a developer material 31 which may comprise such      toner particles only, or of a mixture of oppositely charged magnetic      carrier particles and such toner particles. At the development station 30,      development is achieved when the toner particles of the developer material      31 transfer to the image-bearing surface 12 and there adhere to the      electrostatically formed image, thereby making such image thereon visible. </PAR><PAR>  After such development, that portion of the image-bearing surface 12      carrying the toner developed or visible image thereon, next moves to the      stage CC. Stage CC usually includes a toner image transfer station 33      where the visible toner image on the surface 12 is transferred to a      suitable receiver such as a sheet of paper which is fed in registration to      the station 33 along a sheet travel path. Typically, such image transfer      is effected electrostatically as well as by contact and pressure within a      transfer nip. After such image transfer, the copy sheet then travels to a      fusing station 35, as shown, where the image is permanently fused to the      receiver sheet thereby forming a permanent copy, while the member 11      meantime moves on about the series of rollers 13 through 16 towards the      initial stage AA to begin another imaging cycle. </PAR><PAR>  On leaving the image transfer station 33, each portion of the surface 12 on      which a toner image has been formed and transferred as described above      ordinarily will be contaminated with residual charges as well as with      residual particles, principally residual toner particles. Additionally,      the pressures and process heat at the various stations for example the      image transfer station through interaction with the residual particles      ordinarily result in chemical contamination such as scum and black spots      on the surface 12. To ensure the continued production of high quality      images and copies during subsequent cycles of the imaging process, it is      necessary therefore to effectively clean, that is, to effectively remove      such residual toner particles and chemical contamination from each such      used portion of the surface 12. Accordingly, such cleaning is carried out      at stage DD where apparatus or devices are located for removing the      residual charges and particles as well as renewing the surface 12. As      shown for example, the residual charges can be removed by a discharge lamp      34 and/or neutralized by a corona 36, and the residual toner particles and      chemical contamination can be removed by the combination cleaning and      surface renewing apparatus of the present invention shown generally as 40. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 2, the combination cleaning and surface renewing      apparatus 40 is shown in detail and comprises (a) a housing 42, (b) a      first means 44 for cleaning or removing residual particles from the      surface 12, (c) a second means 46 for abrading the surface 12 so as to      remove at least an atomic layer of material forming on such surface 12,      and (d) a third means 48 for polishing and renewing such surface 12 before      it is again reused in the imaging process as described above. </PAR><PAR>  As shown, the first means 44, which is adapted to remove charged and      uncharged residual particles from the moving surface 12, is mounted inside      the housing 42. First means 44 as mounted includes a cleaning member such      as a cleaning roller 50 which is made from compliant silicone rubber, for      example, that is filled with or has dispersed therein fine non-abrasive      carbon particles so as to make the roller 50 electrically conductive. The      size of the carbon particles should be selected, and the roller 50 should      be made, such that the roller 50 has a smooth surface which has a      roughness factor Ra of ten micro inches (10.mu. in.) or less. Such a      surface roughness effectively does not abrade the surface 12 and also      allows secondary cleaning of the roller 50 for example with a blade. For      such secondary cleaning, the first means 44 includes a scraping blade 52      which is mounted so as to scrape residual particles from the surface of      the roller 50 into a transport auger shown as 54. The auger 54 as such      transports the residual particles away from the cleaning area for      disposal. </PAR><PAR>  The cleaning apparatus 40 is mounted within the reproduction apparatus 10      such that the cleaning roller 50 makes cleaning contact with the moving      surface 12 with the backside of the web 11 being supported over a back-up      roller 56. For effective removal of charge and uncharged residual      particles from the surface 12, the cleaning roller 50 as shown is      electrically biased by a source 58, for example, to a negative polarity,      which polarity should preferably be relatively opposite to the polarity of      the residual toner particles to be removed from the surface 12. In      addition, the surface of roller 50 is preferably driven actively by means      (not shown) in the direction of the arrow 59 for example, and at a speed      that is different from that of the moving surface 12. Preferably, too, the      surface of roller 50 should be driven as such at a speed that is slower      than that of the surface 12. </PAR><PAR>  As also shown, the second means 46 is located downstream of the cleaning      roller 50 relative to the direction of movement of the surface 12. Second      means 46 is suitable for removing chemical contamination such as black      spots and scum from the surface 12. Such chemical contamination for      example results from unpredictable interaction between toner and paper      dust particles under conditions of processing pressure and heat occurring      for example during image transfer and/or during surface cleaning. To      remove such chemical contamination requires that at least an atomic layer      of the material forming the surface 12 be removed </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly, in order to accomplish such layer removal, the second means 46      includes a combination cleaning and first abrasion member such as a roller      60 that is mounted within the housing 42 so as to contact the surface 12      with the backside of the web 11 being supported over a backup roller 62.      The combination roller 60 is made for example from silicone rubber that is      filled with or has dispersed therein fine non-abrading carbon particles      for electrical conductivity, and that is impregnated with a first type of      abrasive particles that each have substantially a first size for example,      such a first type of abrasive particles may comprise aluminum oxide      particles having a size suitable for lightly abrading, that is wearing      into the surface 12 so as to remove at least an atomic layer therefrom.      For such abrasion, the abrasive particles should be selected so as to give      the roller 60 a surface roughness factor, Ra, of about 250.mu. in. The      combination roller 60 as shown is electrically biased by a source 64 which      may have the same polarity as the source 58. </PAR><PAR>  Roller 60 should be actively driven by drive means (not shown) in the      direction for example of the arrow 60A so as to lightly contact the      surface 12, and its surface should have a speed that is also different      from the speed of the surface 12. Preferably, the combination abrading and      cleaning roller 60 should be driven such that its surface moves at a speed      which is slower than that of the surface 12. In order to reduce the      likelihood of the abrading roller 60 generating surface or printable      scratches in the surface 12 as a result of its abrading action, the roller      60 should be made sufficiently large so as to form an abrading footprint      or nip of at least four millimeters (4 mm.) with the surface 12. As shown,      residual particles and abraded debris removed by the combination roller 60      from the surface 12 can be removed therefrom by a compliant roller 65      which is then scraped by a blade 66, and into the auger 54. </PAR><PAR>  As further shown, the third means 48 of the apparatus 40 is comprised of a      rotatable fiber brush 70. The brush 70 is located to contact the already      abraded surface 12 with the back of the web 11 being supported over a      backup roller 72 at a location downstream of the combination cleaning and      abrading roller 60. The brush 70 may comprise fine acrylic fibers 74, for      example, which are chemically sprayed or coated with a second type of      abrasive particles having a second size that preferably is finer than the      size of the first type of abrasive particles of the abrading roller 60.      The second type of abrasive particles for example may be particles of      colorless toner of a size sufficient to produce an equivalent surface      roughness Ra of about 50.mu.in. Such particles of toner may also be      triboelectrically and physically trapped in, as opposed to being      chemically sprayed onto, the acrylic fibers 74 of the brush 70. In either      case, the brush 70 is loaded and driven, for example in the direction of      the arrow 75, against the abraded surface 12 so as to polish and hence      renew such surface 12 thereby substantially erasing and eliminating any      printable scratches thereon that may have resulted for example from      abrading the surface 12 with the abrading roller 60 of second means 46. </PAR><PAR>  As can be seen, the combination cleaning and surface renewing apparatus 40      of the present invention comprises materials and structures that are      adapted to effectively remove charged and uncharged residual particles      from the imaging surface 12 of a copier or printer 10, as well as, to      remove chemical contamination therefrom. Advantageously, the combination      apparatus 40 of the present invention also polishes and effectively renews      such imaging surface 12 by substantially erasing and eliminating any      printable scratches on such surface which may have resulted for example      during removal of the chemical contamination from such surface. </PAR><PAR>  The invention has been described in detail with particular reference to a      presently preferred embodiment, but it will be understood that variations      and modifications can be effected within the spirit and scope of the      invention. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
