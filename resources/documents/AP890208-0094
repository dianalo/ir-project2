A Palestinian teen-ager was reported shot to death today in theoccupied lands, and a Palestinian died of injuries suffered earlierin the uprising.   Israeli government and military officials rejected theconclusions of a U.S. State Department report alleging substantialhuman rights violations and said the report ignored the context ofthe uprising.   The U.S. report, released Tuesday, says methods used by the armyto halt the 14-month revolt have resulted in ``many avoidable deathsand injuries.''   Army sources, who insisted on anonymity, said the unrest at themilitary prison in Megiddo, in northern Israel, began outside whenvisiting relatives went on a rampage, raising Palestinian flags andstoning soldiers' parked cars.   When guards suspended visiting hours, inmates began rioting, thesources said. ``As prisoners returned to cells, they stirred upothers and a serious riot started inside the cells, which is stillcontinuing,'' the sources said.   They said military guards fired tear gas and plastic bullets totry to end the rioting. When that failed, the guards opened firewith live ammunition, they said, resulting in the death and injuries.   An army official later said the riot was brought under controland an investigation was begun.   In the West Bank village of Kabatiya, Arab hospital officialssaid 16-year-old Jamal Salim Zakarni died after being shot in thestomach during a clash with troops. A military spokeswoman said shewas checking the report.   The army confirmed the death of 20-year-old Akram Abu Nahla, aresident of the Rafah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip who died in aTel Aviv hospital.   A military spokeswoman said the circumstances of the death werenot clear. A Gaza City reporter said Abu Nahla was shot in the headwith a plastic bullet Tuesday during a demonstration.   The three deaths raised to 377 the number of Palestinians killedsince the uprising began Dec. 7, 1987. Fifteen Israelis have died.   ``In spite of the constant provocations, the Israel Defense Forcescrupulously maintains moral norms and human rights, and treats anyexceptions with utmost severity,'' the Foreign Ministry said inreponse to the State Department's annual report on human rightsworldwide.   ``The report does not take into consideration the overall contextof the events and continuing provocations. The extreme elements ...directing the events use violence meant to be lethal,'' thestatement said.   The report alleged that Israel's response to the uprising ``ledto a substantial increase in human rights violations.''   ``Soldiers frequently used gunfire in situations that did notpresent mortal danger to troops, causing many avoidable deaths andinjuries,'' it said.   It also said troops often arrest Palestinians without warrantsand demolish houses of people suspected, but not convicted, ofanti-Israeli violence.   Yossi Sarid, a Parliament member of the liberal Citizens RightsMovement, said the report was generally accurate.   ``I am so sorry that in order to see our face we need a mirrorheld from so far away,'' he said on Israel radio.   Jonathan Kuttab, co-founder of the human rights monitoring groupAl Haq-Law in the Service of Man, said he hoped the U.S. governmentwould reassess its $3 billion annual aid to Israel in light of thefindings. ``It's a matter of American dollars not going to a countrythat systematically violates human rights,'' said Kuttab, aPalestinian-American lawyer.   But the military chief prosecutor, Brig. Gen. Amnon Strashnov,told Israeli Television the report was ``exaggerated and unjust.''   Strashnov said that of 21,000 Palestinians arrested since thestart of the uprising, 8,000 have been indicted. Of those, 4,300have been been convicted and 200 acquitted, Strashnov said. Otherswere awaiting trial, he said.   He said about 50 Israeli soldiers have been tried or are facingprosecution for violating army orders.</TEXT></DOC>
