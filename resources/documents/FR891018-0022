The plant occursin crevices and depressions with shallow soils on Kaibab limestone on abroad platform at the rim of the Grand Canyon gorge. This milk-vetch apparentlyprefers the unshaded, well drained soils or limestone pavement in an openingin the pinyon-juniper woodland. Dominant species in the surrounding communityinclude <T3>Petrophytum caespitosum</T3> (rock-mat), <T3>Pinus edulis</T3> (pinyon pine), <T3>Juniperus osteosperma</T3> (Utah juniper), <T3>Cercocarpus intricatus</T3> (little-leaf mountain mahogany), <T3>Ephedra viridis</T3> (Mormon tea), <T3>Cowania mexicana</T3> (cliffrose),<T3> Artemesia bigelovii</T3> (sagebrush), <T3>Agropyron smithii</T3> (wheatgrass), and <T3>Poa pratensis</T3> (bluegrass), (Philips et al. 1982). Sentry milk-vetchand rock-mat are the two dominant species in the dwarf plant communitythat occurs on this limestone pavement. <T3>Astragalus cremnophylax</T3> var. <T3>cremnophylax</T3> is usually less than one inch (2.5 cm) high and formsa mat 1-10 inches (2.5-25 cm) in diameter (McDougall 1964). The short,creeping stems have compound leaves less than 0.4 inches (1.0 cm) longcomposed of 5-9 tiny leaflets. The fruit is obliquely egg-shaped and denselyhairy. Whitish or pale purple flowers are 0.2 inches (0.5 cm) long andapear from late April to early May. Seeds are set in late May-June (Phillipset al. 1982). The plants appear to be long-lived and have a thick tap rootthat penetrates the limestone surface to reach a more constant source ofmoisture. A thorough count of all plants in 1988 indicated that the population contained489 plants. A 1989 inventory of the monitoring plots established in 1988indicated that the population declined about 10 percent. Data indicatethe cause for this decline may be trampling by park visitors. The effectsof trampling on both plants and their habitat may have been amplified bythe below average rainfall in 1989. In 1988, the seedling class comprised only 22.2 percent of the population.Given the trampled condition of most mature plants, a likely explanationfor the small proportion of seedlings is that they are killed by trampling.Only those seedlings in sites relatively safe from trampling survive. Poorseed dispersal may also affect the number of seedlings. <T3>Astragalus cremnophylax</T3> was first discovered in 1903 by MarcusE. Jones who reported it as ``apparently common at Grand Canyon *** onsandy ledges.'' He mistook the plant for <T3>A. humillimus</T3> Gray, of which only Brandegee's imperfect, now flowerlesstype from Mesa Verde, Colorado, is extant. Both are alike in diminutivestature and similar pubescence but differ in petioles and pods. Barnebyand Ripley recollected the species in 1947 at a location west of El Tovar,Grand Canyon National Park. Barneby described it as a new species in 1948.In 1979, Barneby distinguished a new variety, <T3>A. cremnophylax</T3> var. <T3>myriorraphis</T3> after plants were discovered by Ralph Gierisch andassociates in 1978 on Buckskin Mountain in Arizona. The typical form thenbecame <T3>A. cremnophylax</T3> var. <T3>cremnophylax. </T3>On December 15, 1980, the Service published a revised Notice of Reviewfor Native Plants in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (45 FR 82480); <T3>A. cremnophylax</T3> was included in that notice as a category 1 species.Category 1 species are those for which the Service presently has sufficientinformation to support the biological appropriateness of their being listedas endangerd or threatened species. The 1985 revision (50 FR 39526) ofthe 1980 notice included <T3>Astragalus cremnophylax</T3> var. <T3>cremnophylax</T3> in category 1, and moved <T3>Astragalus cremnophylax</T3> var. <T3>myriorraphis</T3> to category 3C. Category 3C includes taxa that haveproven to be more abundant or widespread than was previously believed and/orthose that are not subject to any identifiable threat. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species </ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding speciesto the Federal Lists. A species may be determined to be an endangerd orthreatened species due to one or more of the five factors described insection 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to <T3>Astragalus cremnophylax</T3> var. <T3>cremnophylax</T3> Barneby (sentry milk-vetch) are as follows: A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range.</T3> The population of sentry milk-vetch occursat one of the scenic canyon viewpoints along the West Rim Drive at GrandCanyon National Park. During the summer months, a shuttle bus brings visitorsto the area where they disembark in the paved parking lot. At other times,visitors may drive their own vehicles to this site. At all times of theyear, this area can be reached by walking or hiking. Not all visitors usethe paved walkway that transects the sentry milk-vetch's habitat. The areais flat, and many visitors walk from the parking lot directly to the rim,thus trampling any or all of the vegetation. The 1988 survey showed that65 percent of all plants in the population had experienced some degreeof trampling. More than half of all plants (51.4 percent) experienced severetrampling. Data from 1989 indicates the percent of trampled plants increased,as did the percent of plants showing the effects of severe trampling. Thehigh centers of the mats are the first to show the effects of trampling.The paved trail and related construction activities probably resulted inthe loss of habitat and destruction of plants. Removal of this paved surfaceand rerouting the trail and visitors around the population may increaseand improve the habitat. Trampling may affect the plants and population stability in a number ofways. Observations indicate that foot traffic has uprooted seedlings andmature plants with decreased vigor. Repeated foot-falls on individual plantsmay contribute to decreased productivity and decreased flower and fruitproduction, which may eventually affect recruitment. Degradation of thehabitat by foot traffic is evidenced by the informal trails formed by visitors,the smoothness of the limestone caused by the abrasive action of shoes,and the soil loss in the area. If the decline in plant vigor and habitatcontinues, further declines in population size may occur. B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes.</T3> None known. Because of its rarity, <T3>Astragalus cremnophylaz</T3> var. <T3>cremnophylax</T3> is of interst to botanists and other rare plant enthusiasts.Therefore, take is a minor but present threat. C. <T3>Disease or predation.</T3> None apparent. D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms.</T3> This speciesis protected by National Park Service (NPS) regulations, as are all plantspecies within the park. The NPS constructed fences that alleviate someof the foot traffic. However, park visitors tend to disregard the fences,particularly those fences that separate them from the canyon rim. Sentry milk-vetch is protected by the Arizona Native Plant Law. E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>The number of seedlings produced per year seems to be small and their mortalityis high. Seedling numbers may be less than predicted for a number of reasons.Seed production may be limited by hard frosts and freezes during the flowering/fruitingperiod, a situation that occurred in 1988. Poor seed dispersal may alsoaffect the number of seedlings. The tiny orange seeds are inconspicuousand probably not an attractive food item for birds and mammals. Continuingthe annual inventory of the monitoring plots may help determine whetheror not natural recruitment levels are sufficient to maintain the population.Any undue publicity directed toward this species could make it susceptibleto collection or increased visitation. Many places in the park have signstelling visitors the names and natural history of certain plants; thistype of publicity may be detrimental to the survival of this rare endemic.The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list <T3>Astragalus cremnophylax </T3>var. <T3>cremnophylax </T3>as endangered. With the only known population indecline, the species warrants protection under the Act. Endangered statusseems appropriate because of the imminent serious threat of trampling facingthe population. Critical habitat is not being designated for the reasonsdiscussed below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extentpreduct and determinable, the Secretary propose critical habitat at thetime the species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. The Servicefinds that designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent forthis species. No direct attention should be drawn toward the species orits location. Any type of publicity on this species could make it susceptibleto increased visitation or collection, which would be detrimental to thesurvival of this rare endemic (O'Brien 1984). As discussed under FactorsA and B in the Summary of Factors Affecting the Species, <T3>Astragalus cremnophylax </T3>var. <T3>cremnophylax </T3>is threatened by taking, an activity difficult toenforce against and only regulated by the Act with respect to plants incases of (1) removal and reduction to possession of listed plants fromlands under Federal jurisdiction, or their malicious damage or destructionon such lands; and (2) removal, cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroyingin knowing violation of any State law or regulation, including State criminaltrespass law. Such provisions are difficult to enforce, and publicationof the critical habitat description and map would make <T3>A. cremnophylax </T3>var. <T3>cremnophylax </T3>more vulnerable and increase enforcement problems.The NPS has been notified of the location and importance of protectingthis species' habitat, and has already initiated recovery actions. Protectionof this species' habitat will be addressed through the recovery processand through the Section 7 jeopardy standard. Therefore, it would not nowbe prudent to determine critical habitat for <T3>A. cremnophylax </T3>var. <T3>cremnophylax.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitionsagainst certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part,below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action thatis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species orresult in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat.If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agenciesto ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy oradversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect alisted species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agencymust enter into formal consultation with the Service.The NPS has jurisdiction over the only known habitat for this species.Federal activities that could impact <T3>Astragalus cremnophylax </T3>var. <T3>cremnophylax </T3>include, but are not limited to, keeping the viewpointparking lot open to vehicular traffic, which allows large numbers of visitorsto trample the population, and possible future trail improvement or constructionat the viewpoint.The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62,and 17.63 set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptionsthat apply to all endangered plants. All trade prohibitions of section9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, apply. These prohibitions,in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction ofthe United States to import or export, transport in interstate or foreigncommerce in the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for salethis species in interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduceto possession the species from areas under Federal jurisdiction. In addition,for listed plants, the 1988 amendments (Pub. L. 100-478) to the Act prohibitthe malicious damage or destruction on Federal lands and the removal, cutting,digging up, or damaging or destroying of listed plants in knowing violationof any State law or regulation, including State criminal trespass law.Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservationagencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuanceof permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangeredspecies under certain circumstances.It is anticipated that few trade permits would ever be sought or issuedbecause the species is not common in cultivation or in the wild. Requestsfor copies of the regulations on plants and inquiries regarding them maybe addressed to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fish and WildlifeService, P.O. Box 3507, Arlington, VA 22201 (703/358-2104).<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited</ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, comments orsuggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, thescientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningthis proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments particularly are soughtconcerning:(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to this species;(2) The location of any additional populations of this species and thereasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be criticalhabitat as provided by section 4 of the Act; (3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, and populationsize of this species; and (4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possibleimpacts on this species. Final promulgation of the regulation on this species will take into considerationthe comments and any additional information received by the Service, andsuch communications may lead to a final regulation that differs from thisproposal. The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be received within 45 days of the date of publicationof the proposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed tothe Field Supervisor (See <T2>ADDRESSES</T2>). <ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto Section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.
