The depth of jet penetration and jetwidth were registered by spark photography with an exposure of about10 to the -6th s. It is found that the propagation of the core of a stronglybent jet normal to an airstream is a complex multistage process withvarying velocity. The characteristics of the propagation width of thejet are shown to be similar for channels of different dimensions andshapes and for different sections of the jet path. The results of thestudy are relevant to the practical calculation of the gas-liquid mixersof aircraft and rocket engines. 7 references.</TEXT></DOC>
