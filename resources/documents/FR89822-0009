Corrections to the <T4>Federal Register</T4> printing of the notice of proposed rulemakingwere published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 4, 1989, at 54 FR 13605. The purposeof these proposed rule amendments was to revise, simplify, remove, or clarifyexisting rules or to codify in rules certain practices which are currentlyin effect. The rules involved included those relating to the requirementsfor concurrent use applications; abandonment of trademark applications;appeals to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (Board) from the finalrefusal of registration in ex parte applications; institution and conductof interference, concurrent use, opposition, and cancellation proceedingsbefore the Board; review by civil action of a decision of the Board; andallowing an assignee to take action with respect to the assigned applicationor registration. Written comments were submitted by two firms, five individuals,and one organization. The relevant committee of another organization statedthat it had nothing to add to the comments of the first organization. Twoother organizations submitted letters indicating that they accepted theproposed rule amendments in their entirety.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Specific Sections Being Changed</ITAG>In this discussion, ``Patent and Trademark Office'' is abbreviated as ``PTO''and ``Trademark Trial and Appeal Board'' is abbreviated as ``Board.''Section 2.42(a), which specifies certain requirements for an applicationfor registration as a lawful concurrent user, is amended to remove thedesignation ``(a)'' (because andSection;2.42(b) is removed) and to deletethe qualifying phrase ``to the extent of his knowledge'' from the requirementthat an applicant for registration as a lawful concurrent user state inthe application the area, the goods, and the mode of use for which registrationis sought. This information obviously is within the knowledge of the applicantand is essential for purposes of examination and publication.Section 2.42(b), which requires that the verification or declaration inan application for registration as a lawful concurrent user ``be made withthe stated exceptions,'' is removed to simplify practice. The paragraphhas been construed, in applications for registration based on concurrentuse, as requiring that the portion of the verification or declaration whichnormally reads, ``to the best of his/her knowledge and belief no otherperson, firm, corporation or association has the right to use said markin commerce,'' also include, after the word ``association,'' the additionalphrase ``other than specified in the application.'' Because most applicantsand/or their attorneys do not realize that this is the import of the paragraph,the examination process is often prolonged. Moreover, an applicant forregistration based on concurrent use is required to list, in the statementportion of the application, the exceptions to applicant's right to exclusiveuse, so that it is clear that the verification or declaration is beingmade, in effect, with the stated exceptions. Therefore, the requirementfor a verification or declaration which differs in form from that of anapplication for a geographically unrestricted registration is unnecessary.Section 2.68, which pertains to the express abandonment of an application,presently provides, in the second sentence, that the fact that an applicationhas been expressly abandoned shall not, in any proceeding in the PTO, affectany rights that the applicant may have in the mark which is the subjectof the abandoned application. The section was proposed to be amended byinserting the phrase ``during the ex parte prosecution thereof'' immediatelyafter the phrase ``The fact that an application has been expressly abandoned.''Instead, the section is being amended to include, at the beginning of thesecond sentence, a cross-reference to andSection;2.135 (i.e., ``Except asprovided in andSection;2.135, the fact that an application has been expresslyabandoned shall not * * *''). The cross-reference to andSection;2.135 (whichprovides, in essence, that if an applicant whose application is the subjectof an inter partes proceeding before the Board files a written abandonmentof the application without the written consent of every adverse party,judgment shall be entered against the applicant) has been added, in lieuof the phrase specified in the notice of proposed rulemaking, and as aresult of a written comment received thereon, to further clarify the section.Section 2.91, which governs the declaration of interference proceedings,is amended to change the title of the section from ``Interferences.'' to``Declaration of interference.'' The amendment is one of a series of amendments,involving andSection;andSection; 2.91-2.93, intended to distinguish betweenthe ``declaration'' of an interference by the Commissioner upon petitionand the subsequent ``institution'' of the interference by the Board.<T3> See </T3>andSection;andSection; 1208.04 and 1208.05 of the <T3>Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure.</T3>Section 2.92, which pertains to certain matters preliminary to an interference,is revised to specifically indicate what must happen before an interferencewhich has been``declared'' by the Commissioner upon petition can be ``instituted''by the Board.Section 2.93, which governs the institution of an interference, is amendedto, inter alia, change the title of the section from ``Declaration of interference.''to ``Institution of interference.'', and to revise the text of the paragraphto harmonize with andSection;andSection; 2.91 and 2.92, as amended.Section 2.102(c), which pertains to extensions of time for filing an opposition,was proposed to be amended to change the specified time period ``120 days''to ``four months.'' However, upon further consideration, it appears, forthe reasons described hereafter in the ``Response to Comments on the Rules''portion of this final rule notice, that the proposed amendment might addto confusion regarding the computation of extension periods. Accordingly,the proposal to amend this paragraph is withdrawn.Section 2.104, which states certain requirements for a notice of opposition,is amended to redesignate the present paragraph as ``(a)'' and to add anew paragraph, designated ``(b),'' codifying the practice that oppositionsto different applications owned by the same party may be joined in a consolidatedopposition, when appropriate, provided that the required fees are paid.The proposed new paragraph parallels present andSection;2.112(b).Section 2.106(b)(1), which contains provisions relating to opposition answers,is amended to include a short description of the content requirements foran answer to an opposition, just as present andSection;2.104 describes thecontent requirements for an opposition. The amendment parallels an amendmentmade herein to andSection;2.114(b)(1) concerning answers to petitions forcancellation. The description of the content requirements for an answeris modeled after portions of Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.Section 2.106(c), which governs the withdrawal of an opposition, is amendedto codify the practice that an applicant's written consent to the withdrawalof an opposition after answer may be signed by the applicant or by theapplicant's attorney or other authorized representative. The amendmentparallels amendments made herein to andSection;andSection; 2.114(c), 2.134(a),and 2.135.Section 2.112(a), which states requirements for a petition for cancellation,is revised to delete the requirement that a petitioner indicate in thepetition ``the respondent party to whom notification shall be sent,'' andto substitute a requirement that the petitioner indicate, to the best ofthe petitioner's knowledge, ``the name and address of the current ownerof the registration.'' The purposes of the revision are to provide theBoard with information relating to the identity of the current owner ofthe registration sought to be cancelled, so that the Board can serve acopy of the petition on that party, and to remove any implication thatthe petitioner is permitted to designate who shall be the respondent. Seealso, in this regard, andSection; 2.113, as amended herein.Section 2.113, which concerns notification to the respondent of the filingof a petition for cancellation, is revised to codify the practice thatthe respondent shall be the party shown by the records of the PTO to bethe current owner of the registration sought to be cancelled, except thatthe Board, in its discretion, may join or substitute as respondent a partywho makes a showing of a current ownership interest in the registration.<T3>See generally Gold Eagle Products Co. </T3>v. <T3>National Dynamics Corp., </T3>193 USPQ 109 (TTAB 1976). The sectionis further revised to provide that when the party identified by the petitioner,pursuant to amended andSection; 2.112(a), as the current owner of the registrationor registrations is not the record owner thereof, a courtesy copy of thepetition for cancellation shall be forwarded with a copy of the notificationto the alleged current owner, which may file a motion to be joined or substitutedas respondent.Section 2.114(b)(1), which contains certain provisions relating to cancellationanswers, is amended to include a short description of the content requirementsfor an answer to a petition for cancellation, just as present andSection;2.112(a) describes the content requirements for a petition for cancellation.The amendment parallels the amendment made herein to andSection; 2.106(b)(1)concerning answers to oppositions.Section 2.114(c), which governs the withdrawal of a petition for cancellation,is amended to codify the practice that a registrant's written consent tothe withdrawal of a petition for cancellation after answer may be signedby the registrant or by the registrant's attorney or other authorized representative.The amendment parallels amendments made herein to andSection;andSection; 2.106(c),2.134(a), and 2.135.Section 2.119, which presently governs service of papers, is amended tochange the title from ``Service of papers.'' to ``Service and signing ofpapers.'', so that the section title will describe the contents of thesection as amended herein by the revision of paragraphs (b) and (c), andby the addition of two new paragraphs, designated ``(d)'' and ``(e).''Section 2.119(b), which states, inter alia, methods for service of papers,is revised to provide for two additional methods of service, namely, transmissionby the ``Express Mail'' service of the United States Postal Service andtransmission by overnight courier. The amendment codifies existing practice.Section 2.119(c), which presently provides that when service is made bymail, the date of mailing will be considered the date of service; and thatwhenever a party is required to take some action within a prescribed periodafter the service of a paper upon him by another party and the paper isserved by mail, 5 days shall be added to the prescribed period, is revisedto specify that when service is made by first-class mail, ``Express Mail,''or overnight courier, the date of mailing or of delivery to the overnightcourier will be considered the date of service; and that whenever a partyis required to take some action within a prescribed period after the serviceof a paper upon such party by another party, and the paper is served byfirst-class mail, ``Express Mail,'' or overnight courier, 5 days shallbe added to the prescribed period. The amendments codify existing practice.Section 2.119(d) is added to require that when a party to an inter partesproceeding before the Board is not domiciled in the United States, andis not represented by an attorney or other authorized representative locatedin the United States, the party must appoint a domestic representativeon whom may be served notices or process in the proceeding. The purposeof the paragraph is to facilitate the service of papers on foreign partiesnot represented by domestic counsel in proceedings before the Board.Section 2.119(e) is added to provide that every paper filed in an interpartes proceeding before the Board, and every request for an extensionof time to file an opposition, must be signed by the party filing it, orby the party's attorney or other authorized representative. An unsignedpaper will be refused consideration unless a signed copy is submitted beforeor within a time limit set in the PTO's notification of this defect. Thepurpose of the amendment is to simplify practice, and to eliminate thenecessity for a petition to the Commissioner in the case of an unsignednotice of opposition or request for extension of time to oppose. The finalrule includes a phrase that was not included in the proposed rule, namely,the phrase ``and every request for an extension of time to file an opposition.''The phrase has been added to further clarify the intent of the paragraph(that is, the paragraph was intended to cover requests for extension oftime to oppose, but such a request is not, strictly speaking, a ``paperfiled in an inter partes proceeding before the Board,'' since at the timeof the filing of a request for extension of time to oppose, there is notyet an opposition).Section 2.120(a), which contains certain general provisions relating todiscovery in inter partes proceedings before the Board, is amended to includea new sentence specifying that the opening of discovery is governed bythe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The amendment is a codification ofcurrent practice. <T3>See generally</T3> Saul Lefkowitz and Janet E. Rice, <T3>Adversary Proceedings Before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board,</T3>75 TMR 323, 381-382 (1985). Section 2.120(d), which presently pertains to document production, is amendedto change the title from ``Request for production.'' to ``Interrogatories;request for production.''; to redesignate the present paragraph as ``(2)'';and to add a new paragraph, designated ``(1).'' The new paragraph limitsthe total number of interrogatories which a party may serve upon anotherparty in a proceeding before the Board to seventy-five, counting subparts,with additional interrogatories being allowed by the Board, in its discretion,upon motion to the Board showing good cause, or upon stipulation of theparties; requires that a motion for leave to serve additional interrogatoriesbe accompanied by a copy of the interrogatories, if any, which have alreadybeen served by the moving party, and by a copy of the interrogatories proposedto be served; and provide that if a party upon which interrogatories havebeen served believes that the number of interrogatories served exceedsthe limitation specified in the paragraph, and is unwilling to waive thisbasis for objection, the party shall, within the time for (and insteadof) serving answers and objections to the interrogatories, file a motionfor a protective order, accompanied by a copy of the interrogatories whichtogether are said to exceed the limitation. The purpose of the new paragraphis to discourage parties from using written interrogatories for purposesof harassment, as exemplified in the case of <T3>C. H. Stuart Inc. </T3>v.<T3> S. S. Sarna, Inc., </T3>212 USPQ 386 (TTAB 1980). The amendment isbelieved to be in general harmony with corresponding local rules now prevalentin the federal district courts. Section 2.120(g), which provides for the imposition of sanctions for failureto comply with an order of the Board relating to discovery, is amendedto change the title from ``Failure to comply with order.'' to ``Sanctions.'';to redesignate the present paragraph as ``(1)''; and to add a new paragraph,designated, ``(2),'' providing that if a party fails to attend its discoverydeposition, after being served with proper notice, or fails to respondto a set of interrogatories or to a set of requests for production of documentsand things, and the party or the party's attorney informs the party seekingdiscovery that no response will be made thereto, the Board may make anyappropriate order by way of sanctions. The purpose of the amendment isto eliminate the expense and delay resulting from the present practice,embodied in present paragraphs (e) and (g) of andSection; 2.120, that insituations of the type described in the new paragraph, a motion to compelmust be filed and granted and the resulting order violated before the partyseeking discovery may move for sanctions. The proposed practice is in harmonywith Rule 37(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Section 2.120(j)(3), which describes how a discovery deposition, interrogatoryanswer, or admission may be made of record by a party entitled to relythereon, is amended to redesignate the present paragraph as ``(i)'' andto add a new paragraph, designated ``(ii).'' The new paragraph codifiesthe existing practice, exemplified in cases such as <T3>Jeanne-Marc, Inc. </T3>v.<T3> Cluett, Peabody andamp; Co., Inc.,</T3> 221 USPQ 58 (TTAB 1984); <T3>Autac Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Viking Industries, Inc.,</T3> 199 USPQ 367 (TTAB 1978); <T3>Harvey Hubbell, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Red Rope Industries, Inc., </T3>191 USPQ 119 (TTAB 1976); and <T3>MRI Systems Corp. </T3>v.<T3> Wesley-Jessen, Inc.</T3>, 189 USPQ 214 (TTAB 1975), that a party whichhas obtained documents from another party, pursuant to a request for productionunder Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, may not make theproduced documents of record by notice of reliance alone, except to theextent that the documents fall within the provisions of andSection; 2.122(e).The reason for the practice is that documents so obtained generally sufferfrom a lack of proper authentication, unless they are of the self-authenticatingtype admissible by notice of reliance under andSection; 2.122(e). Section 2.120(j)(4), which presently provides, in effect, that if an appropriateparty files a notice of reliance upon only part of a discovery deposition,an adverse party may file a notice of reliance upon any other part of thedeposition which should in fairness be considered so as to make not misleadingwhat was offered by the submitting party, is amended to require that thenotice of reliance filed by the adverse party be supported by a writtenstatement explaining why the adverse party needs to rely upon each of theadditional parts listed in the adverse party's notice, failing which theBoard, in its discretion, may refuse to consider the additional parts.The amendment represents a codification of current practice. <T3>Cf. Alabama Board of Trustees </T3>v.<T3> BAMA-Werke Curt Baumann,</T3> 231 USPQ 408, 409 (TTAB 1986), and <T3>Holiday Inns, Inc. </T3>v.<T3> Monolith Enterprises,</T3> 212 USPQ 949, 950-951 (TTAB 1981). Section 2.120(j)(5), which presently specifies who may make of record (bynotice of reliance) an interrogatory answer or an admission, is amendedto require that a party which seeks to rely upon certain of its own responsesto interrogatories or requests for admissions, pursuant to the fairnessexception presently provided in the paragraph, support its notice of reliancewith a written statement explaining why it needs to rely upon each of theadditional discovery responses listed in the notice, failing which theBoard, in its discretion, may refuse to consider the additional parts.The amendment parallels the amendment made herein to paragraph (j)(4) ofthe section and represents a codification of current practice. <T3>See The Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama </T3>v.<T3> BAMA-Werke Curt Baumann, supra, </T3> and <T3>Holiday Inns, Inc. </T3>v.<T3> Monolith Enterprises, supra.</T3> Section 2.120(j)(8), which presently provides that ``[i]nterrogatories,requests for production, requests for admissions, and materials or depositionsobtained during the discovery period'' should not be filed with the Boardexcept under certain specified circumstances, one of which is ``when submittedwith a motion to compel,'' is revised to provide that ``requests for discovery,responses thereto, and materials or depositions obtained through the discoveryprocess'' should not be filed with the Board except under certain specifiedcircumstances; to change the phrase ``when submitted with a motion to compel''to ``when submitted with a motion relating to discovery;'' and to statethat papers or materials filed in violation of the paragraph may be returnedby the Board. The purpose of the revision is to clarify the beginning ofthe paragraph, and to reduce the number of papers and materials which mustbe retained in a proceeding file and stored by the Board. The amendmentchanging the phrase ``when submitted with a motion to compel'' to ``whensubmitted with a motion relating to discovery'' did not appear in the noticeof proposed rulemaking as a proposed amendment. However, the amendmentis ``housekeeping'' in nature, being necessary to harmonize this paragraphwith amendment andSection; 2.120(d)(1), which requires that copies of interrogatoriesbe filed with the Board in connection with two additional discovery motions,namely, the motion for leave to serve additional interrogatories, and themotion for a protective order filed in response to interrogatories believedto be excessive in number. Section 2.121(a)(1), which governs the scheduling of trial periods, isamended to include a new sentence codifying the practice that the resettingof a party's time to respond to an outstanding request for discovery willnot automatically result in the rescheduling of the discovery and/or testimonyperiods, and that such dates will be rescheduled only upon stipulationof the parties approved by the Board, or upon motion granted by the Board,or by order of the Board. Section 2.122(e), which presently requires that a notice of reliance ona printed publication specify the printed publication and the pages tobe read, indicate generally the relevance of the material being offered,and be accompanied by ``the printed publication or a copy of the relevantportion thereof, including the title page and any other page needed toshow the place and date of publication, the name and address of the publisher,and the name of the author or the editor,'' is amended to require thatthe notice of reliance specify the printed publication (including informationsufficient to identify the source and the date of the publication) andthe pages to be read; indicate generally the relevance of the materialbeing offered; and be accompanied by the printed publication or a copyof the relevant portion. The purpose of the amendment is to simplify practice.Section 2.123(c), which governs notices of depositions, is amended to clarifythe paragraph and to codify the current practice that testimony depositionsmay be noticed for any reasonable time and place in the United States,but that a testimony deposition may not be noticed for a place in a foreigncountry except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of the section. This codificationof practice as to the place where testimony depositions may be taken roughlyparallels andSection; 1.673(a), which governs the taking of testimony depositionsin patent interference proceedings in the PTO.Section 2.123(e)(2), which pertains to the examination of witnesses duringoral deposition, is amended to include a new sentence stating that exhibitswhich are marked and identified at a deposition will be deemed to havebeen offered into evidence, without any formal offer thereof, unless theintention of the party marking the exhibits is clearly expressed to thecontrary. The purpose of the amendment is to revise existing practice,which requires, on the part of the party marking the exhibits, either aformal offer or a clear indication in the transcript of an intent to introducethe exhibits. <T3>See, e.g., Roux Laboratories, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Kaler,</T3> 214 USPQ 134, 135-136 (TTAB 1982); <T3>H. Betti Industries, Inc.</T3> v. <T3>Brunswick Corp.,</T3> 211 USPQ 1188, 1189 (TTAB 1981); and <T3>Kay Corp. </T3>v. <T3>Weisfield's, Inc.,</T3> 190 USPQ 565, 567-568 (TTAB 1976). Under theexisting practice, a party can lose a case simply because the party's attorneyforgets to make a formal offer of the exhibits marked and identified duringthe party's testimony deposition. Under the practice set forth in the amendedparagraph, the Board will be able to determine such cases on their merits,rather than on the basis of a technical defect.Section 2.123(g)(1), which relates to the form of deposition transcripts,is amended to permit the use of paper with numbered lines as an alternativeto consecutively numbering the questions propounded to a witness. The amendment,which parallels andSection; 1.677(a), the provision governing the form ofdeposition transcripts in patent interference proceedings, will simplifypractice.Section 2.125(a), which governs the filing and service of testimony, isamended to codify the existing practice that if a copy of a depositiontranscript, with exhibits, is not served upon each adverse party withinthirty days after completion of the taking of the testimony or within anextension of time for that purpose, any adverse party which was not servedmay have remedy by way of a motion to the Board to reset the adverse party'stestimony and/or briefing periods, as may be appropriate. The paragraphis further amended to provide that if the deposing party fails to servea copy of the transcript with exhibits on an adverse party after havingbeen ordered to do so by the Board, the Board may strike the deposition,or enter judgment by default against the deposing party, or take otheraction as may be deemed appropriate.Section 2.127(e)(1) is added to codify the long-established practice thata motion for summary judgment should be filed prior to the commencementof the first testimony period, as originally set or as reset, and thatthe Board, in its discretion, may deny as untimely any motion for summaryjudgment filed thereafter. <T3>See Rainbow Carpet, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Rainbow International Carpet Dyeing andamp; Cleaning Co.,</T3> 226 USPQ718 (TTAB 1985); <T3>Allegro High Fidelity, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Zenith Radio Corp., </T3>197 USPQ 550 (TTAB 1977); <T3>La Maur, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Bagwells Enterprises, Inc.,</T3> 193 USPQ 234 (Comm'r Pat. 1976); <T3>Peterson's Ltd., Inc. </T3>v.<T3> Consolidated Cigar Corp.,</T3> 183 USPQ 559 (TTAB 1974); <T3>Cities Service Oil Co. </T3>v.<T3> Perfection American, Inc.,</T3> 157 USPQ 209 (TTAB 1968); T. JeffreyQuinn, <T3>Tips From the TTAB: Inter Partes Summary Judgment Revisited,</T3> 76TMR 73 (1986); and David J. Kera, <T3>Tips From the TTAB: Summary Judgment,</T3> 71 TMR 59, 61-62 (1981).Section 2.127(e)(2) is added to provide, in essence, that for purposesof summary judgment only, a party may rely on its own responses to requestsfor discovery served upon it by an adverse party. The new paragraph changesthe Board's current practice, under which a party normally is not permittedto rely upon its own responses to discovery for purposes of summary judgment.It is believed that the new practice will be more consistent with the practicein the Federal district courts.Section 2.127(f) is added to codify the existing practice that the Boarddoes not have authority to hold any person in contempt, or to award attorneys'fees or other expenses to any party. Although paragraphs (f), (g), and(h) of andSection; 2.120, the section which governs the taking and use ofdiscovery in inter partes proceedings before the Board, include provisionsvery similar in nature to the new paragraph, some litigants and/or theirattorneys have mistakenly assumed that the Board has the authority to awardattorneys' fees or other expenses in situations not involving a failureto provide discovery. The addition of this new paragraph to andSection; 2.127,the section which governs motions in general, will clarify the matter.Section 2.128(b), which presently provides, in pertinent part, that withoutleave of the Board, no brief shall contain more than fifty pages of argument,is amended to specify a minimum type or print size for a brief and to providethat without prior leave of the Board, a main brief on the case shall notexceed fifty-five pages in length in its entirety. Litigants before theBoard, and their attorneys, are often confused as to exactly what is encompassedby the term ``argument,'' as used in the present paragraph. The amendmentsimplifies and clarifies practice by specifying length limits for briefsin their entireties, followed by a list of the elements which are includedwithin the length limit. The limit specified in the amended paragraph isfive pages longer than that specified in the present paragraph, becausethe new length limit covers the entire brief, including the table of contentsand index of cases, whereas the present length limit does not.Section 2.129(a), which presently provides, in pertinent part, that oralarguments at final hearing will be heard by three Members of the Board,is amended to provide that such oral arguments will be heard by at leastthree Members of the Board. The purpose of the amendment, which parallelsan amendment made herein to andSection; 2.142(e)(1), is to reflect the Board'suse of augmented panels in certain cases.Section 2.134(a), which pertains to the surrender or voluntary cancellationof a registration which is the subject of a cancellation proceeding beforethe Board, is amended to codify the practice that in a cancellation proceeding,an adverse party's consent to the respondent's voluntary surrender of theinvolved registration may be signed by the adverse party or by the adverseparty's attorney or other authorized representative. The amendment parallelsamendments made herein to andSection;andSection; 2.106(c), 2.114(c), and 2.135.Section 2.135, which states the effect of the abandonment of an applicationwhich is the subject of an inter partes proceeding before the Board, isamended to codify the practice that in an opposition, concurrent use, orinterference proceeding, an adverse party's consent to an applicant's abandonmentof the applicant's involved application may be signed by the adverse partyor by the adverse party's attorney or other authorized representative.The amendment parallels amendments made herein to andSection;andSection; 2.106(c),2.114(c), and 2.134(a).Section 2.142(b), which governs ex parte appeal briefs, is amended to redesignatethe present paragraph as ``(1)'' and to add a new paragraph, designated``(2),'' codifying the form requirements and a length limit (twenty-fivepages) for briefs filed in connection with ex parte appeals to the Board.Section 2.142(e)(1), which presently provides that oral argument on anex parte appeal to the Board will be heard by three Members of the Board,is amended to provide that oral argument will be heard by at least threeMembers of the Board. The purpose of the amendment, which parallels anamendment made herein to andSection; 2.129(a), is to reflect the Board'suse of augmented panels in certain cases.Section 2.142(f)(6) is added to codify the practice that if, during anappeal to the Board from a refusal of registration, it appears to the examinerthat an issue not previously raised may render the mark of the appellantunregistrable, the examiner may, by written request, ask the Board to suspendthe appeal and to remand the application to the examiner for further examination.Section 2.145(c)(4) is added to provide that a party to a proceeding beforethe Board which commences a civil action, pursuant to section 21(b) ofthe Act, seeking review of a decision of the Board should file writtennotice with the Board, within one month after the expiration of the timefor appeal or civil action, in order to avoid premature termination ofthe Board proceeding. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that partieswho seek review of Board decisions by way of civil action will be awareof the need for informing the Board thereof.Section 2.186, which presently provides that any action with respect toan assigned application or registration which may or must be taken by aregistrant or applicant may be taken by the assignee provided that theassignment has been recorded, is amended by adding at the end the phrase``or that proof of the assignment has been submitted.'' The purpose ofthe amendment is to bring the section into closer conformity with section10 of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Response to Comments on the Rules</ITAG>The written comments received in response to the notice of proposed rulemakinghave been given careful consideration, and a number of the suggested modificationshave been adopted. The comments and responses are discussed below.<T3>Comment: </T3>In the notice of proposed rulemaking, it was stated inthe ``Discussion of Specific Sections Proposed to be Changed'' that andSection;2.68, which pertains to the express abandonment of an application, wasproposed to be amended to indicate that the section applies only to theabandonment of an application during the ex parte prosecution thereof,i.e., an application not involved in an inter partes proceeding beforethe Board. Specifically, the proposed amendment was that the second sentenceof the section, which presently reads, ``The fact that an application hasbeen expressly abandoned shall not, in any proceeding in the Patent andTrademark Office, affect any rights that the applicant may have in themark which is the subject of the abandoned application,'' be amended byadding the phrase ``during the ex parte prosecution thereof'' immediatelyafter the phrase ``The fact that an application has been expressly abandoned.''One firm commented that if the proposed amendment was intended to clarifythe fact that this section applies only to ex parte applications, the phrase``during the ex parte prosecution thereof'' should be added not to thesecond sentence of the section but rather after the words ``An application''in the first sentence, which presently reads, ``An application may be expresslyabandoned by filing in the Patent and Trademark Office a written statementof abandonment or withdrawal of the application signed by the applicant,or the attorney or other person representing the applicant.''<T3>Response: </T3>The intent of the proposed amendment was to make itclear that the second sentence of the section (i.e., the sentence whichprovides, in essence, that the express abandonment of an application shallnot, in any proceeding in the PTO, affect any rights which applicant mayhave in the mark which was the subject of the abandoned application) appliesonly to the abandonment of an application during ex parte prosecution (theeffect of the abandonment of an application which is the subject of aninter partes proceeding before the Board being governed by andSection; 2.135).Thus, the ``Discussion of Specific Sections Proposed to be Changed'' shouldhave stated that andSection; 2.68 was proposed to be amended to indicatethat the ``second sentence of the section'' (not ``the section'') appliesonly to the abandonment of an application during the ex parte prosecutionthereof. The first sentence of the section, which relates to the form ofan express abandonment, is applicable both to applications which are thesubject of an inter partes proceeding before the Board and to those whichare not. Thus, the suggested modification has not been adopted. However,for purposes of added clarity, and in lieu of the amendment proposed inthe notice of proposed rulemaking, the beginning of the second sentenceof the section is being modified to include a cross-reference to andSection;2.135 (i.e., ``Except as provided in andSection; 2.135, the fact that anapplication has been expressly abandoned shall not * * *'').<T3>Comment: </T3>Section 2.102(c) was proposed to be amended to changethe specified time beyond which an extension of time to oppose will notbe granted without the consent of the applicant or a showing of extraordinarycircumstances, from ``120 days from the date of publication'' to ``fourmonths from the date of publication.'' The organization indicated its beliefthat since the proposed change would not affect the statutorily mandated``30 day'' period for filing an opposition, the amendment would (at leastinitially) add to confusion regarding the computation of extension periods.In the same vein, one firm commented that the proposed amendment wouldmake sense provided the Board allows potential opposers to request extensionsof time to oppose in terms of months rather than days.<T3>Response: </T3>It is true that under section 13 of the Act of 1946,the statutorily mandated period for filing an opposition is ``thirty daysafter the publication * * * of the mark sought to be registered.'' Section13 further provides, in part, that the time for filing an opposition shallbe extended for an additional thirty days upon written request prior tothe expiration of the thirty-day opposition period, and that further extensionsof time for filing an opposition may be granted by the Commissioner forgood cause when requested prior to the expiration of an extension. Uponfurther consideration, it appears that the proposed amendment may encouragepotential opposers to request the first and subsequent extensions of timeto oppose in terms of months rather than days, causing confusion in thecomputation of extension periods. Accordingly, the proposal to amend andSection;2.102(c) is withdrawn. In the event that section 13 of the Act is amendedto change the time periods specified therein from ``thirty days'' to ``onemonth,'' the proposal to amend andSection; 2.102(c) to change the designation``120 days'' to ``four months'' may be included in a future notice of proposedrulemaking.<T3>Comment: </T3>With respect to the proposal to revise andSection; 2.113(which concerns notification to the respondent of the filing of a petitionfor cancellation) to indicate that the respondent ``shall be the partyshown by the records of the Patent and Trademark Office to be the currentowner of the registration or registrations sought to be cancelled, exceptthat the Board, in its discretion, may join or substitute as respondenta party who makes a showing of a current ownership interest in such registrationor registrations,'' one individual suggested, in effect, that the sectionbe further revised to provide that if the party identified by the petitioneras the current owner of the registration is not the party shown by therecords of the PTO to be the owner, service of the notification and ofthe petition will be made on the identified current owner as well as onthe record owner. The individual notes that this revision would make andSection;2.113 consistent with proposed (and amended) andSection; 2.112(a) (governingthe contents of a petition for cancellation), which requires, in part,that the petitioner indicate, to the best of petitioner's knowledge, thename and address of the current owner of the registration. In addition,one firm suggested that andSection; 2.113 be further revised to provide thata copy of a petition for cancellation will be sent (by the Board) bothto the registrant and to the registrant's last attorney of record. Thefirm expressed its belief that sending a copy of the petition for cancellationto the registrant's last attorney of record as well as to the registrant``may serve to speed up cancellation proceedings, which are sometimes delayedby many months by reason of the fact that the registrant cannot be locatedand it is necessary to publish notice of the proceeding in the Office Gazette.''<T3>Response: </T3>Under present practice, when a petitioner informs theBoard of petitioner's belief that the registration sought to be cancelledis currently owned by a party other than the party shown by the recordsof the PTO to be the owner, the Board sends a copy of the notificationand of the petition to cancel both to the record owner, and to the partyidentified by the petitioner as the current owner. The current owner mayfile a motion, supported by evidence of its current ownership of the registration,to be joined or substituted as respondent. The paragraph has been modified,as suggested by the first individual, to reflect this practice.As to the suggestion that andSection; 2.113 be further revised to providethat a copy of the petition for cancellation will be sent both to the registrantand to the registrant's last attorney of record, it is the practice ofthe Board, in those cases where the respondent's copy of the petition forcancellation is returned to the Board as undeliverable, to send a writtencommunication to the petitioner asking the petitioner for information concerningrespondent's current address. If the petitioner files a response indicatingthat the respondent is no longer in business, notice of the proceedingis published in the <T3>Official Gazette. </T3>If the petitioner fails to file a reponse, orfiles a response indicating that it is unable to furnish respondent's currentaddress, the Board attempts to locate the respondent. Typically, the Boardwill contact a telephone information operator in the city of respondent'slast-known address; the respondent's last attorney of record, if thereis an attorney and such attorney's last appearance of record on the respondent'sbehalf was within the last five years or so; and/or the Secretary of Stateof the respondent's state of incorporation. If the Board is unable to locatethe respondent after reasonable investigation, notice of the proceedingis published in the <T3>Official Gazette</T3>.The practice suggested by the firm would be burdensome to the Board sincethe Board would have to make an extra copy of the petition to cancel (andany exhibits attached thereto) to send to the attorney; this would haveto be done for most cancellation proceedings, since most respondents havebeen represented by counsel at one time or another; and in those caseswhere the copy of the petition for cancellation mailed to the respondent'sattorney was returned to the Board as undeliverable, the returns wouldbe additional receipts to be processed by the Board.Under the Board's present practice, on the other hand, the Board acts onlyin those cancellation proceedings in which the respondent's copy of thepetition for cancellation is returned as undeliverable (a minority of cases).Preliminary steps have been taken to begin giving notice, by publicationin the <T3>Official Gazette</T3>, of the filing of every petition for cancellationsoon after its filing date, thus eliminating the need for a later serviceby publication in cases where the Board's efforts to serve notice of theproceeding by mail are unsuccessful.Accordingly, the modification suggested by the firm has not been adopted.<T3>Comment: </T3>Section 2.119(b), which lists methods for service ofpapers by one party upon another in an inter partes proceeding before theBoard, was proposed to be amended to specifically provide for the serviceof papers by two additional methods, namely, transmission by the ``ExpressMail'' service of the United States Postal Service and transmission byovernight courier. One individual applauded the proposal but commentedthat on one occasion, a problem arose when an overnight courier delivereda paper directly to the PTO at its physical location in Virginia. The individualsuggested that if the proposed amendment is adopted, ``the overnight couriershould be provided a physical address rather than Box 5 at Washington DC20231.''<T3>Response: </T3>Section 2.119(b) pertains to the service of papers byone party upon another, not to the filing of papers with the PTO.<T3>Comment: </T3>Section 2.119(c), which presently provides, in part,that whenever a party is required to take some action within a prescribedperiod after the service of a paper upon that party by another party andthe paper is served by mail, 5 days shall be added to the prescribed period,was proposed to be amended to apply also to service by ``Express Mail''or by ovenright courier. One individual commented that when service ismade by ``Express Mail'' or overnight courier, the addition of 5 days toany prescribed time period for taking action seems unjustified. This individualsuggested that the paragraph be modified to provide for the addition ofonly one day to the prescribed time for taking action when service is madeby ``Express Mail'' or by overnight courier.<T3>Response: </T3>Since papers transmitted by ``Express Mail'' or by overnightcourier are not always delivered in one day, it was determined that thenumber of added days for service should be the same for service by ``ExpressMail'' or by overnight courier as for service by first-class mail. An attorneywho does not want to give an adverse party the advantage of having 5 addeddays after service by ``Express Mail'' or by overnight courier can alwayselect to serve by first-class mail instead. Accordingly, the suggestedmodification has not been adopted.<T3>Comment: </T3>New andSection; 2.119(d) was proposed to be added to require,in essence, that a party to an inter partes proceeding who is not domiciledin the United States and is not represented by an attorney or other authorizedrepresentative located in the United States, appoint a domestic representativeon whom may be served notices or process in the proceeding. One firm commentedthat the proposed paragraph might be redundant because any foreign applicantis required (by andSection; 2.24) to designate a domestic representativein the application.<T3>Response: </T3>In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the term ``application''was inadvertently used instead of the correct term ``proceeding'' in thesecond sentence of the paragraph. Although andSection; 2.24 requires thatan applicant not domiciled in the United States appoint a domestic representative,there is no rule which makes any similar requirement in the case of a foreignopposer, petitioner, or respondent involved in an inter partes proceedingbefore the Board. The proposal to add new andSection; 2.119 was intendedto remedy that oversight and thus to facilitate the service of papers onforeign opposers, petitioners and respondents not represented by domesticcounsel. Inasmuch as there is, in fact, a need for the proposed requirement,proposed andSection; 2.119(d) is adopted herein as a final rule, and thesecond sentence has been corrected by substituting the term ``proceeding''for the term ``application.''<T3>Comment: </T3>Section 2.120(a), which contains certain general provisionsrelating to discovery in inter partes proceedings before the Board, wasproposed to be amended to include a new sentence specifying that the openingof discovery is governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. One firmcommented, in essence, that the proposed amendment ``does not clarify thesituation of when discovery opens;'' that the opening of discovery as setforth in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure does not work in oppositionand cancellation proceedings because of the delay (of one to two months)between the filing of the complaint, i.e., the notice of opposition orpetition for cancellation, and service of a copy of the complaint uponthe defendant by the Board; that this delay gives the defendant, whichmay start to take discovery immediately after the complaint is filed, anadvantage over the plaintiff, which cannot take discovery until a copyof the complaint has been served by the Board upon the defendant, and isnot entitled to receive responses to its interrogatories, requests forproduction, and requests for admission until 45 days after such serviceby the Board; and that the ``preferred situation would be for the Boardto set forth a specific time before which discovery requests cannot beserved,'' as, for example, to provide that discovery opens on the datethat the Board notifies the defendant of the filing of the proceeding.<T3>Response: </T3>It is apparent that the thrust of the firm's commentsrelating to this proposed amendment is not that the proposed new provisionis unclear but rather that the firm would prefer a different practice withrespect to the opening of discovery in proceedings before the Board. Theproposed amendment codifies a long-standing practice which, in the experienceof the Board, has worked smoothly. Although some defendants in Board oppositionand cancellation proceedings learn about the existence of the proceeding,and serve discovery requests, before the Board serves them with a noticeof the filing of the proceeding and a copy of the complaint, most do not.Nor does the plaintiff, who, after all, is the party which initiated theproceeding, and has had time to plan and prepare therefor, suffer any realprejudice (as opposed to a possible perceived tactical disadvantage) inthose cases where the defendant does initiate discovery before the plaintiffcan do so. Accordingly, the modification suggested by the firm has notbeen adopted.<T3>Comment: </T3>Section 2.120(d) was proposed to be amended to includea new paragraph, designated ``(1),'' limiting the number of interrogatorieswhich a party may serve upon another party to twenty-five, not countingsubparts (required to be relevant, and reasonable in number), with additionalinterrogatories being allowed by the Board, in its discretion, only uponmotion to the Board showing extraordinary circumstances, or upon stipulationof the parties.One individual expressed his belief that the proposed ``extraordinary circumstances''test is too harsh and suggested instead that the test be ``substantialneed in the preparation of the moving party's case.''A second individual expressed his belief that the ``reasonable number ofrelevant subparts'' provision is so subjective that it would lead to anincrease in discovery disputes and motions. This individual suggested thatthe interrogatory limit be set at fifty rather than twenty-five, and thatthe ``reasonable number of relevant subparts'' provision be replaced withthe sentence, ``In computing the total number of interrogatories, eachsubdivision of separate questions shall be counted as an interrogatory.''A third individual commented that limiting interrogatories to twenty-fivewith a reasonable number of subparts would cause uncertainty over whetherinterrogatories, although numbered twenty-five or less, actually containmore than twenty-five separate questions, leading litigants to make theirown count of the questions, answer twenty-five, and not answer fully theremainder on the ground that supernumerary questions are not authorizedby the rules. To remedy this problem, the individual suggested that ifthe proposed rule is adopted, it might be advisable to add ``a provisionprescribing that relief for an excessive number of interrogatories is aprotective order rather than an incomplete response to the interrogatories.''The same individual also commented that in any event, the rule should notbe applied to pending cases.One firm commented that by stating that the twenty-five interrogatoriesmay contain a reasonable number of relevant subparts, the whole purposeof the proposed rule (to discourage harassment by the use of too many interrogatories)has been defeated since the interrogatory limit can easily be avoided byusing subparts. The firm suggested that the number of interrogatories belimited instead to a stated number, such as 125, including subparts; andthat the rule be clarified to provide for extra interrogatories in caseswhere more than one mark is involved.Another firm expressed its belief that the number of interrogatories shouldnot be limited; that the proposed rule would make practice before the Boardmore expensive and less convenient; that the particular number limit proposedis even below the number allowed by some federal courts; that the ``extraordinarycircumstances'' test is not practical because of the lack of specificityas to what constitutes ``extraordinary'' circumstances, and because ofthe delay involved in having to file a motion to obtain a ruling on thequestion; and that a better practice would be a provision which allowsa party to move for a limitation on the number of interrogatories if aproblem arises. This firm submitted copies of a number of different federaldistrict court local rules pertaining to interrogatories.Finally, an organization expressed its concern that the proposed limitationon the number of interrogatories could: (1) Lead to an increase in motionsto the Board in order to permit parties to serve valid follow-up interrogatoriesregarding prior responses and documents produced; or (2) result in increasedreliance on depositions, generally a more costly and intrusive form ofdiscovery. The organization recommended that the PTO monitor the impactof this amendment carefully and further amend the rule to make it lessrestrictive, if the circumstances warrant.<T3>Response: </T3>Upon careful consideration of the comments, and supportingarguments, submitted with respect to proposed andSection; 2.120(d)(1), itis concluded that the ``reasonable number of relevant subparts'' provisionis so subjective that it would lead to a large increase in discovery disputesand motions, and hence be burdensome both to the Board and to litigantsand their attorneys. Moreover, if unlimited subparts were allowed, thepurpose of the proposed paragraph (to discourage parties from using writteninterrogatories for purposes of harassment) would, as noted by the firm,be defeated, since the interrogatory number limit could easily be avoidedthrough the use of many subparts; whereas, if no subparts were allowed(or if each subpart were counted as an interrogatory), the limit in theproposed rule might lead to increased use of discovery depositions, a morecostly form of discovery. The proposed limitation was not intended to depriveparties of interrogatories for which they have a legitimate need or tomake it more expensive for parties to obtain discovery. Rather, it wasintended to protect litigants from being harrassed by excessive numbersof interrogatories. Accordingly, the proposed paragraph has been modifiedto limit the total number of interrogatories which a party may serve uponanother party in a proceeding to seventy-five, counting subparts, withadditional interrogatories being allowed by the Board, in its discretion,upon motion to the Board showing good cause, or upon stipulation of theparties. The words ``total'' and ``in a proceeding,'' which were not includedin the proposed rule, have been included in the final rule to make it clearthat the number limitation refers to the total number of interrogatoriesserved during an entire proceeding, not just per set of interrogatories.The suggestion that the final rule include, in lieu of a specific limitationon the number of interrogatories which may be served, a provision allowinga party to move for a limitation on the number of interrogatories if aproblem arises, has not been adopted. It is believed that such a provisionwould result in a large number of motions from parties which would notbe willing to answer interrogatories without first obtaining a ruling fromthe Board as to whether the interrogatories were reasonable in number.The amended paragraph has not been modified to provide for extra interrogatoriesin cases where more than one mark is pleaded by the plaintiff, or wherethe proceeding involves more than one mark registered or sought to be registeredby the defendant, because in such cases the adverse party may simply requestthat each interrogatory be answered with respect to each mark, and theinterrogatories will be counted the same as if they pertained to only onemark. In the same vein, the final rule does not provide for extra interrogatoriesin cases where there is a counterclaim for cancellation of a plaintiff'spleaded registration or registrations, because the discovery informationneeded by a defendant in a proceeding before the Board for purposes ofdefending itself against the plaintiff's claim usually encompasses anyinformation which may be needed for a counterclaim. Thus, it is believedthat in most cases, the mere fact that there may be a multiple mark situation,or a counterclaim, will not result in a need for interrogatories exceedingin total number the limitation specified in the final rule. However, inthose cases where there is, because of a multiple mark or counterclaimsituation, a legitimate need for interrogatories exceeding the specifiedlimit in number, the party who wishes to serve additional interrogatorieswill be able to make the requisite showing of good cause in support ofa motion for leave to do so.For purposes of clarity, the final paragraph includes (as did several ofthe Federal district court local rules submitted by one firm) a requirementthat a motion for leave to serve additional interrogatories be accompaniedby a copy of the interrogatories which have already been served by themoving party, if any, and by a copy of the interrogatories proposed tobe served. Obviously, the Board cannot make an informed ruling on sucha motion without these copies.The final paragraph also includes, as suggested by one individual, a provisionindicating that relief for an excessive number of interrogatories is aprotective order rather than an incomplete response to the interrogatories.Specifically, the final paragraph states that if a party upon which interrogatorieshave been served believes that the number of interrogatories served exceedsthe limitation specified in the paragraph, and is not willing to waivethis basis for objection, the party shall, within the time for (and insteadof) serving answers and objections to the interrogatories, file a motionfor a protective order, accompanied by a copy of the interrogatories whichtogether are said to exceed the limitation.The suggestion that this rule not be applied to pending cases has not beenadopted. By a final rule notice published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 18, 1972 at 37 FR 7605, the rules ofpractice in trademark cases were amended to substantially adopt the liberaldiscovery practice provided under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.Those rule amendments were made applicable to all proceedings filed onor after July 1, 1972. The result was that for a number of years, someinter partes cases before the Board were governed by one set of rules,providing a liberal discovery practice, and others were governed by anotherset of rules under which discovery was more restricted. This situationcaused confusion among litigants and their attorneys and was burdensometo the Board. Further, it is desirable that other rule amendments hereinbe made effective in all cases as soon as possible, and it would be extremelyconfusing for all concerned if some of the rule amendments were made applicableto all cases pending before the Board on or after the effective date ofthe rule amendments, and others were made applicable only to proceedingswhich commenced on or after that date. For these reasons, it is believedthat the better alternative is to make the new interrogatory rule applicableto all inter partes proceedings pending before the Board on or after theeffective date of the rule amendments. However, the new rule will applyonly to interrogatories served on or after that date (although interrogatoriesserved prior to that date will, of course, be counted in determining whetherinterrogatories served after the effective date violate the limitationspecified in the new rule; that is, a party who has served 100 interrogatoriesprior to the effective date of the new rule is not given license by thenew rule to serve another 75 after the effective date).Finally, as suggested by the organization, the PTO will monitor the impactof this rule amendment carefully and further amend the rule to make itless restrictive, if circumstances warrant.<T3>Comment: </T3>One individual and one firm commented, with respect toproposed andSection;andSection; 2.120(g)(2) and 2.120(j)(3)(i), that thereappeared to be significant errors in the text as published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and in the <T3>Patent, Trademark andamp; Copyright Journal. </T3><T3>Response: </T3>The noted errors were made in printing, when severalpages of original text were transposed. On April 4, 1989, a correctionnotice pertaining to those errors, among others, was printed in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>at 54 FR 13605. The errors did not appear inthe text as published in the <T3>Official Gazette. </T3><T3>Comment: </T3>Section 2.123(e)(2), which pertains to the examinationof witnesses during oral deposition, was proposed to be amended to includea new sentence stating that exhibits which are marked and identified ata deposition will be deemed to have been offered into evidence, withoutany formal offer thereof, unless the intention of the parties is clearlyto the contrary. The purpose of the proposed amendment was to revise existingpractice, which requires, on the part of the party marking the exhibits,either a formal offer or a clear indication in the transcript of an intentto introduce the exhibits. One individual commented that the clause ``unlessthe intention of the parties is clearly to the contrary'' is somewhat inaccurateand ambiguous. The individual suggested that the proposed clause be modifiedto read, ``unless the intention of the party marking the exhibit is clearlyexpressed to the contrary.'' <T3>Response: </T3>The paragraph has been modified as suggested. <T3>Comment: </T3>One individual commented that he applauded the proposalto amend andSection; 2.123(g)(1), which relates to the form of depositiontranscripts, to permit the use of paper with numbered lines as an alternativeto consecutively numbering the questions propounded to a witness, but suggestedthat the paragraph be amended further to delete another requirement, namely,the requirement that the name of the witness be plainly and conspicuouslywritten at the top of each page. The individual questioned whether ``itis necessary to still require that the name of the witness be written atthe top of each page provided that the testimony of each witness is boundinto one or more volumes separately from the testimony of any other witnessand clearly marked on the cover and at the first and last to indicate thename of that particular witness.'' The individual noted that many of thereporters available for use in this type of proceeding are retired formercourt reporters who have established independent businesses, and `'whodo not have elaborate word processing which could perform that task automaticallyduring printing.'' <T3>Response: </T3>The appearance of the name of the witness at the topof each page of a deposition transcript is quite helpful to the Board.For example, sometimes litigants submit, in connection with a motion, copiesof several selected pages from one or more deposition transcripts. In suchcases, the name at the top of the page is sometimes the only means theBoard has of determining whose testimony is on each page. Moreover, often,while drafting an opinion, it is necessary for a Board Member to referrepeatedly to a number of open deposition transcripts, and it would beinconvenient for the Board Member to have to keep turning to the frontof the transcripts to verify the identity of the witness in each one. Accordingly,the suggestion has not been adopted. <T3>Comment: </T3>With respect to andSection; 2.127(e)(1), which was proposedto be added to provide that a motion for summary judgment should be filedprior to the commencement of the first testimony period, and that the Board,in its discretion, may deny as untimely any motion for summary judgmentfiled thereafter, the organization commented that the language does nottake into account the possibility that the trial periods may be reset;and recommended that the problem be corrected by substituting the phrase``opening trial date'' for the phrase ``first testimony period.'' <T3>Response: </T3>The phrase ``opening trial date'' is somewhat ambiguoussince ``trial date'' might be construed by some litigants as referringto the date on which testimony is actually scheduled to be taken, ratherthan the date of the commencement of the testimony period. Moreover, itis not believed that the substitution of the phrase ``opening trial date''for the phrase ``first testimony period'' would solve the problem perceivedby the organization. It appears that the organization may have construedthe phrase ``first testimony period'' as meaning the opening testimonyperiod as first set, when in fact the phrase was intended to signify theopening testimony period of the plaintiff, as distinguished from othertestimony periods, such as the testimony period of the defendant (particularlywhere the defendant is also the plaintiff in a counterclaim, in which casethe testimony period of the defendant as defendant in the main proceedingand as plaintiff in the counterclaim could be argued to be the ``openingtestimony period'' for purposes of the counterclaim), the rebuttal testimonyperiod of the plaintiff, etc. In any event, in order to further clarifythe paragraph, the phrase ``as originally set or as reset'' has been includedin the amended paragraph immediately after the phrase ``first testimonyperiod.'' This should not be construed as meaning, however, that when theBoard denies a motion for summary judgment as untimely filed, but resetsthe plaintiff's main (i.e., ``first'') testimony period, the motion maybe refiled before the commencement of the period as reset, and consideredtimely. <T3>See La Maur, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Bagwells Enterprises, Inc., supra. </T3><T3>Comment: </T3>Section 2.127(e)(2) was proposed to be added to providethat for purposes of summary judgment only a party may rely upon its ownresponses to discovery requests. The organization stated that it opposesthis amendment ``because it could lead to discovery abuses and will createconflicting treatment of a party's own answers to discovery, dependingupon whether the case is resolved on summary judgment or after a trialon the merits.'' The organization also expressed its belief that althoughthe proposed paragraph follows practice in the Federal district courts,the limited jurisdiction and sanctioning power of the Board ``would tendto frustrate the self-policing effect of the rule as it operates in a federalcourt context.'' One individual commented that the proposed paragraph maymislead some lawyers into thinking that the filing, without more, of aparty's own interrogatory answers, etc., in connection with a motion forsummary judgment will make them probative; that rule 56(e) of the FederalRules of Civil Procedure specifies certain requirements for affidavitssubmitted in connection with a summary judgment motion; that these requirements(namely, that the affidavits be made on personal knowledge, set forth suchfacts as would be admissible in evidence, and show affirmatively that affiantis competent to testify to the matters stated therein) have been appliedby the courts to answers to interrogatories filed in support of or in oppositionto a summary judgment motion; and that the proposed paragraph should bemodified to refer to these requirements, as, for example, by the additionof the phrase ``and subject to the requirements of rule 56(e) of the FederalRules of Civil Procedure'' after the introductory phrase ``For purposesof summary judgment only.'' <T3>Response: </T3>It is noted that the specific discovery abuses fearedwere not enumerated. To the extent that the proposed practice would createconflicting treatment of a party's own responses to discovery, dependingupon whether a case is resolved upon summary judgment or after trial onthe merits, it is not believed that this is a matter of great concern.Indeed, there is precedent for such a conflict in the treatment of evidence.Under present practice, there is conflicting treatment of affidavit ``testimony,''which is not admissible at trial except by agreement of the parties (seeandSection; 2.123(b)), but is admissible for purposes of a motion for summaryjudgment (subject to the requirements of rule 56(e) of the Federal Rulesof Civil Procedure).Essentially, the matters raised by the organization and by the individualare factors to be considered by the Board in determining the probativevalue of a party's own discovery responses submitted for purposes of summaryjudgment. However, the proposed paragraph relates to the admissibilityof this type of evidence, not to its probative value. The fact that a pieceof evidence is admissible does not mean that it will necessarily be accordedgreat, or even any, probative value. Over the years, many attorneys have argued, in briefs filed in connectionwith summary judgment motions, that a party's own discovery responses shouldbe admissible for purposes of summary judgment. Under the circumstances,the paragraph is being adopted as proposed, without any modifications.However, the impact of the new rule will be monitored carefully, and theparagraph will be modified by future rulemaking, if necessary. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 2.128(b), which governs the form of briefs atfinal hearing, presently provides, in part, that without leave of the Board,no brief shall contain more than fifty pages of argument and, in the caseof a reply brief, the entire brief shall not exceed twenty-five pages.The paragraph was proposed to be amended to provide that without priorleave of the Board, ``a main brief on the case shall not exceed fifty-fivepages in length in its entirety, including the table of contents, indexof cases, description of the record, statement of the issues, recitationof facts, argument, and summary, and a reply brief shall not exceed twenty-fivepages in its entirety.'' The two firms commented that the table of contentsand index of cases should not be included in the page limitations for mainbriefs. They stated that these two elements do not actually constitutethe brief, but clearly facilitate the use and reading of the brief, andhence are helpful to both the Board and the parties; that incorporationof these parts into the page limitation will encourage minimal use of thesefeatures; and that in most federal courts which have a limitation on thenumber of pages, these two elements are excluded from the limitation. <T3>Response: </T3>The provision of present andSection; 2.128(b), that no(main) brief shall contain more than fifty pages of argument, has alwaysbeen deemed by the Board to exclude the table of contents and index ofcases (as well as any attached exhibits or appendices, which are not consideredto be part of the brief itself), but to include (the term ``argument''being construed broadly) the description of the record, statement of theissues, recitation of facts, arguments based on the law and the facts,and summary. Because of confusion on the part of litigants and their attorneysas to which parts of the brief are included within the length limitationof the present provision, and for purposes of clarity, the paragraph wasproposed to be amended to include all parts of the brief itself (again,any exhibits or appendices to the brief are not considered to be part ofthe brief). Since the proposed amendment included in the length limitationthe two elements which had not been included before, namely, the tableof contents and index of pages, the brief length limitation was proposedto be increased from fifty pages to fifty-five pages. It is believed thatthe allowance of an extra five pages is more than sufficient to cover thetable of contents and index of cases in main briefs before the Board, andthat a page limitation which is all-inclusive is simpler and less confusingthan one which is not all-inclusive. Therefore, the suggested modificationhas not been adopted. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 2.142(b)(2) was proposed to be added to governthe form of briefs on the case in ex parte appeals before the Board. Theproposed paragraph provides, in part, that without prior leave of the Board,a brief shall not exceed twenty-five pages in length in its entirety. Theorganization commented that the proposed provision would limit appeal briefs``to a maximum of 25 pages, including all appendices and exhibits;'' thatalthough the proposed rule allows a party to seek prior leave to file amore extensive brief, it is likely that the need to seek such leave willarise too frequently, with the result being a counter-productive rule;and that if a page limit is required, it should either be increased orclarified to exclude exhibits and appendices. <T3>Response: </T3>Exhibits and appendices to a brief are not consideredby the Board to be part of the brief, and hence are not included withinthe length limitation. However, the inclusion in the paragraph of a referenceto exhibits and appendices to an appeal brief may mislead some litigantsand/or their attorneys into believing that new evidence may be submittedwith an appeal brief by way of an exhibit or appendix thereto, when, infact, an applicant may submit new evidence after appeal only with the consentof the Examining Attorney or in accordance with the provisions of andSection;2.142(d). Accordingly, the suggested modification has not been adopted.<T3>Comment: </T3>Section 2.142(f)(6) was proposed to be added to provide,in part, that ``if, during an appeal from a refusal of registration, itappears to the examiner that an issue not involved in the appeal may renderthe mark of the appellant unregistrable, the examiner may request the Boardto suspend the appeal and to remand the application to the examiner forfurther examination.'' The organization commented that the paragraph shouldbe modified to specify that the Examining Attorney must file a writtenrequest and show good cause before an application will be remanded forexamination; that the situations in which remand is allowed by the Boardshould be closely scrutinized; that after an applicant has submitted itsappeal brief, for example, remand should be allowed, if at all, only inthe most exceptional circumstances; and that when a requested remand isfor the purpose of curing technical problems previously overlooked, theconsent of the applicant shall be sought. <T3>Response: </T3>The proposed paragraph, which codifies present practice,has been modified to specify that the Examining Attorney's request forremand must be written (as is, in fact, the practice). The remainder ofthe organization's suggestions, if adopted, would make it much more difficultfor the Examining Attorney to obtain a remand of the application for purposesof further examination with respect to an issue not involved in the appeal.However, it is in the interest of the public, the applicant, and the PTOto avoid the issuance of an invalid registration. Accordingly, the remainderof the organization's suggestions have not been adopted. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 2.145(c)(4) was proposed to be added to providethat a party to a proceeding before the Board who commences a civil action,pursuant to section 21(b) of the Act, seeking review of a decision of theBoard must file written notice thereof in the PTO, addressed to the Board,within one month after the expiration of the time for appeal or civil action,in order to avoid premature termination of the Board proceeding. The organizationcommented that the proposed paragraph requires further clarification todefine what is meant by the term ``premature termination;'' that dependingon the meaning, the result of a ``premature termination'' may be too harsh,e.g., where a party may have otherwise perfected an appeal of a Board decisionwith the exception of having timely filed written notice of the proceedingwith the Board; and the word ``should'' should be substituted for the word``must'' in the proposed paragraph.<T3>Response</T3>: When a decision of the Board has become final, thatis, when the time for appeal therefrom has expired and no appeal has beenfiled, the PTO takes certain further steps, based on the final decision,including those steps necessary to give effect to the decision. This processis referred to as the ``termination'' of the proceeding. For example, whena decision of the Board dismissing an opposition has become final, theword ``Terminated'' is stamped on the file of the opposition proceeding,the opposition file is sent to the warehouse where terminated proceedingfiles are stored, and the registration sought by the applicant is issued.When a decision of the Board granting a petition for cancellation has becomefinal, one of the further steps taken as a consequence thereof is the cancellationof the respondent's subject registration. If an ``appeal'' by way of civilaction is taken from a decision of the Board, and the PTO is not notified,the PTO, believing the Board's decision to be final, will take the furthersteps which are appropriate based on the decision, i.e., the PTO will ``terminate''the proceeding, not knowing that it is doing so prematurely.The premature termination of a Board proceeding has no effect on the perfectionof the ``appeal'' by way of civil action, and is not in the nature of asanction, but rather occurs because the PTO has followed its normal proceduresto give effect to a decision of the Board. The purpose of the proposedparagraph is simply to warn litigants who have filed a civil action seekingreview of a decision of the Board that they need to give timely noticeto the PTO of the filing of the civil action so that the PTO will not takesteps to give effect to the Board's decision in the mistaken belief thatit is final, when in fact it is not.However, it is possible that in some cases where a written notice of thecommencement of a civil action is filed shortly after the time specifiedin the rule, the PTO will not yet have terminated the proceeding, and thereforethe written notice, even though somewhat untimely, will serve to avoidpremature termination of the proceeding. For this reason, the paragraphhas been modified as suggested by substituting the word ``should'' forthe word ``must.''The adoption of the suggestion that the proposed paragraph be clarifiedto define what is meant by the term ``premature termination'' would resultin a rule which is unduly lengthy. Moreover, a detailed explanation ofthe meaning of the term has been given in this final rule notice.<T3>Comment</T3>: Two individuals and one firm submitted suggestions forchanges to rules not involved herein.<T3>Response</T3>: The suggested changes cannot be adopted without affordingmembers of the public an opportunity to comment thereon. However, thesesuggestions will be considered in connection with any future amendmentsto the rules of practice in trademark cases.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental, Energy, and Other Considerations</ITAG>The rule change will not have a significant impact on the quality of thehuman environment or the conservation of energy resources.The rule change is in conformity with the requirements of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (Pub.
