A survey of 11,631 high-school students nationwide lastyear found that 36% had used tobacco in the 30 days beforethe survey. The survey also found that 12.8% of the studentswere frequent cigarette smokers, which means they smoked on26 or more days in the month preceding the survey.</LP><TEXT>   The survey also shows that a steady drop in the percentageof adolescent smokers has come to a halt. &quot;There was a strongdecline for seven or eight years, and now it's leveled off,&quot;says Gary Giovino, chief of the epidemiology branch for theOffice on Smoking and Health at the Centers for DiseaseControl. &quot;That's alarming.&quot;   However, the study shows that tobacco use is far lessprevalent among black students. While 41.2% of white and 32%of Hispanic students said they use tobacco, only 16.8% ofblack students do, according to the survey. Black studentsused to smoke at the same rate as white students in the1970s, says Mr. Giovino.   The study also found that tobacco use is a greater problemamong male students. While 31.7% of female students usetobacco, 40.4% of male students do, the survey says. And19.1% of male students use smokeless tobacco, such as snuff,compared with only 1.4% of the female students.</TEXT></DOC>
