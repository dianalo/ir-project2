Western diplomats said the action raised fears that PresidentMengistu Haile Mariam's communist government will use harsh tacticsto suppress Marxist separatists in the north, where the war hasmade it difficult to get relief supplies to 3.2 million droughtvictims.   Addis Ababa Radio said the decree, issued Saturday, gavesecurity forces and administrators sweeping powers to fight theEritrean and Tigrean rebels in this East African nation.   It said people and their property will be evacuated within 15days from 6-mile-wide strips along Ethiopia's 1,500-mile borderwith Sudan and along the 600-mile Red Sea coastline, excluding theEritrean port of Massawa.   The report did not indicate how many people would be affected,but the areas are sparsely populated.   The decree, issued by the Council of State and signed byMengistu, establishes military and security councils to direct allmilitary and civilian activities and empowers them to transfer orexpel people and sequester private property for public service.   Western diplomats said they were particularly concerned about asection of the decree giving the councils power to declare any areaprohibited.   ``It smacks of free-fire zones. ... Presumably the intention isto say you get out of the area and if not, you're dead meat,'' saidone Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.   President Reagan said last month that ``starvation and scorchedearth are being considered as weapons to defeat the rebellion.''   Rebels of the secessionist Eritrean People's Liberation Fronthave been fighting for 27 years in Africa's oldest civil war, andguerrillas of the Tigre People's Liberation Front took up arms 14years ago to demand more autonomy. They have won major victoriesthis year and captured several towns since February.   Mengistu on March 31 said his government is starting a hugecounteroffensive. In his first acknowledgment of the war, Mengistusaid his troops were fighting a ``grim struggle'' against rebels inthe country's northernmost provinces.   A week later, his government expelled from Eritrea and Tigreabout 60 foreign relief workers, citing ``personnel risks.''   The action has crippled a massive Western relief operation.Government officials have said indigenous organizations willcontinue relief efforts, but insist that military objectives musttake priority over humanitarian needs.   In Congress last month, Chester Crocker, U.S. assistantsecretary of state, accused Mengistu of banning relief workers tohide the fighting.   ``He doesn't want anyone to see what's going on up there,because it's going to be bloody,'' Crocker told the Africa andhuman rights subcommittees of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.   Mengistu inherited the insurgencies in 1974 when, with a cliqueof fellow army officers, he helped overthrow Emperor Haile Selassie.</TEXT></DOC>
