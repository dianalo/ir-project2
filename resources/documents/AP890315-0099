(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A soldier is suing to keep the Army fromsending her to South Korea and separating her from her infantdaughter.   ``Having a child was one of the most important decisions I havemade,'' Spec. 4 Cheryl Beekman of Newport News said in the lawsuitfiled Tuesday in federal court. ``I did not give birth to her so Icould have someone else raise her.''   Unless a judge blocks the transfer, Ms. Beekman must report toSouth Korea on March 23 and find someone to care for her 6-month-olddaughter, Lauren.   Ms. Beekman's husband, Chris, left Virginia in October to take ajob in Tacoma, Wash., where the family hopes to settle. She moved inwith a friend.   Ms. Beekman said in the lawsuit that she recognized soon afterher daughter's birth that she would have a hard time balancingmotherhood and life as a soldier.   Col. David A. Whaley, Ms. Beekman's group commander, overruledrecommendations from her superiors and an Army chaplain that she bedischarged, saying in a letter that a soldier should anticipatemoves and long deployments.   No hearing on Ms. Beekman's case has been set.   ``Obviously, she's not going to refuse to go if they deny this,''said her attorney, Kenneth E. Labowitz.   Ms. Beekman, 21, could not be reached for comment Tuesday. Whaleydid not return calls to his office.   Ms. Beekman enlisted 2{ years ago and has been working at FortEustis as a graphics illustrator.   During her pregnancy, Army officials asked whether she wanted adischarge. Under military law, she had a right to one if she wantedit at that time, Labowitz said. But Ms. Beekman decided to try toraise her daughter and finish her stint in the service.   Labowitz said his client, who has 1{ years left to serve,``didn't know what she was getting into.''</TEXT></DOC>
