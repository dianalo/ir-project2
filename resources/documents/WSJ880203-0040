John M. Carpenter of Boca Raton, Fla., was a vice president and account executive at the brokerage firm's Lighthouse Point office in Broward County when he and another broker bilked the clients, federal prosecutors said.    Mr. Carpenter and John G. Kenning of Delray Beach, Fla., allegedly schemed to defraud their clients of more than $8 million, which was converted to personal use, from October 1984 to July 1986. Mr. Kenning pleaded guilty in October to conspiracy and wire and securities fraud. He was sentenced in December to eight years in prison and also was ordered to pay $8 million restitution.    Mr. Carpenter pleaded guilty earlier to one count of conspiracy to violate wire fraud and securities fraud laws.    The men told investors they were acting on behalf of the brokerage, but Dean Witter had no knowledge of the actions, the government said.    Funds paid to investors were said to be tax-free interest when they actually were obtained from sales of interests to other investors, prosecutors said. The defendants also were accused of guaranteeing principal plus interest payments that were never paid. </TEXT></DOC>
