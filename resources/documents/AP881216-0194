Winkler spoke to journalists as he was driven from Sidon to aSyrian command post in Rmeileh, six miles north of this southernport.   He flashed the V for victory sign as he posed jovially for newsphotographers in front of a portrait of Syrian President Hafez Assadin Rmeileh.   Asked if he will resume his Red Cross work in Lebanon, Winklersaid: ``I'm afraid I will have to leave Lebanon soon. ... Myenthusiasm has suffered.''   Police sources said Winkler would be taken to Damascus, Syria,before he flies home Saturday. But ICRC sources in Beirut said hewould be be taken to Swiss Ambassador Dino Sciolli in Christian eastBeirut. There was no explanation for the discrepancy. All sourcesspoke on condition of anonymity.   Also Friday, gunmen in south Lebanon abducted three Irishsoldiers of the U.N. peacekeeping force and demanded the release ofa guerrilla leader abducted by Israel, police said. Three otherIrish U.N. soldiers were briefly held by armed residents Thursdayfor the same reason.   Winkler, 32, was freed at 9 p.m. at Hisbeh Square in Sidon,Lebanon's third-largest city, the same spot where he was abductedNov. 17.   He was in high spirits, cleanshaven and looked fit, with no signof physical torture or maltreatment. ``I have shaved off the beardI've grown in captivity today,'' he said.   The leftist Nasserite Popular Organization militia, which hasbeen ruling Sidon since the 1975 outbreak of Lebanon's civil war,took delivery of Winkler upon his release.   He was turned over to the Swedish ambassador to Syria andLebanon, Rolf Gauffin, who took Winkler in his black Volvo toRmeileh and then to Beirut. A carload of Syrian secret service menescorted the freed hostage on the 25-mile trip from Sidon to theLebanese capital.   The Christian-controlled Voice of Lebanon radio station saidWinkler was released by the Fatah-Revolutionary Council, theguerrilla group headed by Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal.   The police spokesman quoted Winkler as telling the militia'schief of staff, Usama Saad, he did not know the identity of thosewho held him.   ``I was held in a small room all the time, with only one jailerentering to bring in meals,'' police quoted Winkler as telling Saad.   ``But whenever others came in to talk to me the jailer used toblindfold me. These people told me time and again that I was beingheld to guarantee that Hussein Hariri will be treated well inSwitzerland.''   Hariri, 22, a Shiite Moslem Lebanese, is scheduled to go on trialin Geneva on Feb. 20 on charges of hijacking an Air Afrique jetlineron July 14, 1987 and forcing it to land at Geneva airport. He isaccused of killing a French passenger before he was overpowered andarrested.   On his way to Beirut, Winkler told The Associated Press hethought his kidnappers made a mistake by seizing him.   ``Then I was really shocked when I found myself in a cell. I waschained to the wall and had this little bed to lie on, a fewblankets, no light. Well, I thought, Merry Christmas.''   ``I tried not to feel too much throughout all those four weeks,''Winkler said. ``It just hurt most of the time.''   He said he was served three meals a day throughout _ mostlychicken sandwiches initially ``which caused me a lot ofindigestion.''   After he complained, ``I got vegetables, eggs in the morning,bread, sometimes soup. I asked for fruit and I got bananas andmandarines. I got tea, Pepsi, and well, I really have to admit I waswell-treated.''   He said he had a radio for a while and then TV and was allowedLebanese French-language weeklies.   ``I missed most the wind in my hair, the sun, the sky, thingslike that. It was liberty that I also missed, to do what I wanted todo,'' Winkler said.   He confirmed that he wrote a note, delivered by the kidnappersDec. 2, which said he was kidnapped because he was a Swiss citizenand not an ICRC official.   ``I really believed that,'' he said.   Red Cross officials had been in continuous contact with Lebaneseand Palestinian factions in a bid to gain Winkler's release. EarlierFriday, the Red Cross addressed an open letter to Winkler and saidit would not rest until he gained his freedom.   Not including the three Irishmen, 14 foreigners are still heldhostage in Lebanon _ nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman andan Italian. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of TheAssociated Press, is the longest held. He was kidnapped on March 16,1985.   The Nasserite Popular Organization, one of several pro-Nassergroups in Lebanon, cooperates with Palestinian guerrillas. It is alargely Sunni Moslem outfit. Its area of control is restricted toSidon.</TEXT></DOC>
