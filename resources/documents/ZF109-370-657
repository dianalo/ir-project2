Siked is the Chairman of the Federalcommunications Commission (FCC).andP;  He was appointed by President Bush inAugust, 1989.andM;&quot;The FCC considers the need for competitive diversity as essential.&quot;andM;&quot;The FCC is committed to listening to everyone,&quot; he prooclaimed to thisaudience.andM;&quot;Users do not want to be overcharged -- and they shouldn't be.&quot;andP;  He assuredthe ICA members that the FCC goes &quot;beyond lip service $(to users$).&quot;andP;  Theirgoals are:andM;1.andP;  competition--diversity of providersandM;2.andP;  an &quot;umparalleled&quot; period of modernization and accelerated serviceandM;&quot;Vendors will face genuine competition.&quot;andP;  (Is that a promise or a threat?andP;  Ordoes that depend on which side of the buy/sell spectrum you are on?)andM;He had some advice for vendors: &quot;Let your customers determine your product,not your marketing department or your engineering department.&quot;andP;  (Sounds likegood advice for hard/sft vendors too.)andM;He claims competitive pressures are accelerating the move to digitalcommunications and fiber optics.andP;  The results is &quot;The customers $(aregetting$)the benefits much sooner.andP;  The regulators couldn't accomplish whatcompetition did.&quot;andM;He acknowledged that there is some discussion as to whether the U.S.andP;  teleconindustry is &quot;leading or lagging.&quot;andP;  He fell short of claiming we are leading,but he did point out we have the &quot;best domestic satelite facilities.&quot;andP;  Hethen added, &quot;We must carefully examine our regulations [too keep uscompetitive$).&quot;andP;  (Having brought up the leading/lagging question, hisprotestations were not reassuring.)andM;He further shook our reassurance by warning telecon vendors that prolongingthe use of outmoded equipment--to increase profits--endangers theircompetitive position in the future.andP;  Example: the U.S.andP;  has a 17.5 yeardepreciation schedule for switches vs 6 years in Japan.andM;Throughout his talk, he stressed competitiveness and modernization--which (itfollows like the night follows the day) makes us suspicious about the stateof our competitiveness and modernization.andM;He offered a Qandamp;A period.andP;  Comments included:andM;* The FCC has the responsibility to set standards for HDTV.andP;  They will do soby spring 1993.andP;  (!!)andM;CAN COMMENT: What does that do to our competitive position in that market?andO;It sounds like we are abandoning the market to the Japanese until then.andP;  Bythen -- and allowing for additional start-up time -- how can we compete?andM;* Some of the most rapid developments in the U.S.andP;  telecon market are in theprivate services, not the public service.andM;* &quot;The FCC relations with the Congress are good now.&quot; und underscored the&quot;now.&quot;)  &quot;Needles friction can be counterproductive.andM;* &quot;The FCC has experienced a decline in purchasing power--by about 20%.&quot;andP;  &quot;Weneed more resources.&quot;andM;* If competition is effectively determining the tariffs, &quot;there need be noregulatory interference.andP;  Let the marketplace resolved the question.&quot;andM;* &quot;The regulation of ATandamp;T has to be re-examined.&quot;andP;  They still wieldmonopolistic powers in some areas.andM;* The U.S.andP;  would eliminate international barriers on a reciprocal basis, butwe do not &quot;believe in unilateral disarmament.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
