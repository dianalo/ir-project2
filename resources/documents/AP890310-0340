Sources familiar with the firm's plea-bargain settlement talks,who spoke on condition they not be identified, said the samerestrictions apply to Milken's brother Lowell, a senior Drexel aidewho is expected to be indicted as well.   Securities and Exchange Commission negotiatiors imposed therestrictions in talks with Drexel aimed at resolving wide-rangingcivil fraud charges against the firm, the sources said.   Terms of the settlement represent much tighter restrictions onDrexel and the Milken brothers than earlier disclosed in itsbargaining to end an intense federal fraud investigation that hasdogged the firm for more than two years. A draft of the settlement,which SEC commissioners are expected to vote on next week, alsocompels Drexel to submit to the oversight of two panels that willscrutinize its finances and interrogate employees about possiblewrongdoing, the sources said.   Further, the sources said, the SEC will require the firm to puton leave any Drexel employee named in future enforcement actions bythe watchdog agency.   In exchange, the SEC has dropped an earlier insistence thatDrexel relocate its lucrative high-yield bond division from BeverlyHills, Calif., to the firm's New York headquarters, the sourcessaid. Drexel had argued that such a move would devastate itsbusiness in the $175 billion high-yield bond market.   A Drexel-SEC settlement is a crucial precondition for finalizinga criminal plea bargain with the Justice Department, which the firmagreed to in December to avoid a crippling racketeering and fraudindictment.   In negotiations with federal prosecutors, Drexel previously hadagreed to fire the Milkens and withhold most of their 1988compensation. Lawyers for the brothers have challenged thatagreement in court.   ``The SEC agreement takes it a step further,'' said one source.``It implicitly says you can't hire the guy after you fire him, andit says you can't talk to the guy.''   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said in a statement: ``Both sidesto the settlement discussions have worked diligently andconscientiously for months now toward an agreement and we are notgoing to comment on it. When the details are final they will be madepublic and then the facts will be available.''   Chiles Larson, a spokesman for the SEC in Washington, declined tocomment in accordance with agency policy on pending cases.   Officials at Robinson Lake Lerer andamp; Montgomery, a public relationsfirm hired by Michael Milken to speak on his behalf, declined tocomment. Eugene Licker, an attorney for Lowell Milken, also declinedto comment.   Michael Milken is considered one of the most dynamic financiersof the decade and is largely credited with vaulting Drexel to theforefront of the lucrative market in high-yield debt securities,known as junk bonds. He created Drexel's Beverly Hills-based bondtrading division about 10 years ago.   He also has been a leading target of a federal campaign againsttrading abuses spawned by a Wall Street corruption scandal that ledto the exposure of frauds by Ivan F. Boesky, a well-known speculatornow in prison.   Boesky has been the main source of evidence against Drexel andthe Milken brothers, accusing them of crimes that range from insidertrading to stock manipulation to cheating Drexel clients.   Drexel asserted innocence until Dec. 21, when it capitulated tofederal pressure and agreed to a plea bargain in order to avoidpotentially devastating racketeering charges, which carry enormousfines and penalties.   The Milkens have denied all wrongdoing and have yet to be chargedwith any crime. But they are widely expected to be indicted soon onfederal fraud and racketeering charges.   Drexel's chief executive Frederick Joseph admitted in courtpapers filed earlier this week that the firm agreed to fire theMilkens and deny them most of their 1988 compensation at theinsistence of federal prosecutors.   In an indication of other settlement-related management changesat Drexel, the firm on Friday announced the appointment of a newvice chairman and three appointments in the corporate financedepartment.   Joseph said in a statement that the moves ``importantly positionDrexel to capitalize on the opportunities we see ahead.''</TEXT></DOC>
