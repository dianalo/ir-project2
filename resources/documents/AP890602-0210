Michael S.Dukakis' presidential campaign have been scattered by theircandidate's defeat seven months ago.   Most of the top staffers have landed jobs to match theirexperience. But for some the job search has been frustrating.   On Friday, former campaign manager Susan Estrich was deliveringthe commencement address at Wellesley College. Top aide John Sassoworked for his six-figure salary at a Boston advertising firm. Andmaster fund-raiser Robert Farmer was in the midst of his usual12-hour day raising money for the Democratic National Committee andworking for a top Washington lobbyist.   Some former aides, however, worry about the break-up of theDukakis-Democrat family. They say more has to be done by the DNC tokeep the troops who ran the campaign a viable force.   ``The Republicans have a tradition of taking care of theirown,'' said Leslie Dach, former communications director for theDukakis campaign. ``I don't think you see that'' on the Democraticside.   ``There's no feeling out there that the people who gave monthsor years of their lives to elect a Democratic president should behelped or rewarded,'' said Dach, who works as public affairsdirector for Edelman Public Relations in Washington, D.C.   Washington, Harvard University and the Dukakis gubernatorialadministration appear to be the most common receiving grounds forformer campaign staffers. Jack Corrigan and Stephen Rosenfeld, whoheld top campaign positions, are back as top aides to the governor,whose popularity has suffered in recent months. Mindy Lubber, whohandled scheduling for the Dukakis campaign, is now press secretary.   Jack Weeks, the gregarious ex-boxer who handled press andadvance work for Dukakis and _ rightly or wrongly _ was blamed forsetting up the famous tank photo opportunity that went so badly,now is an administrator for the state Department of Public Works.And former campaign spokesman Mark Gearan is back in his old job asthe governor's federal state relations liaison.   In Washington, Paul Tully, who made headlines for hisparticipation in the videotape incident that resulted in U.S. Sen.Joseph Biden's withdrawal from the presidential primaries, nowworks as a policy director for the Democratic National Committee.   Sasso, who left the Dukakis campaign following the Bidenincident and then returned in the final months, enjoys relaxing.   ``On Sundays instead of rushing to get up early to read all thepapers and watch all the Sunday shows, now I decide where my sonRobert and I should go fishing,'' he said.   Susan Brophy, who went from delegate coordinator for Dukakis tocongressional staffer for U.S. Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., agreesthat the losing party in a presidential race must struggle to keepits operatives involved. For her own part, Brophy says she feelsobligated to work for a Democrat in the 1992 presidential race.   ``But I would never quit my job and go work on a presidentialcampaign again,'' she said.   Says Dach, ``There are only so many doughnuts you can eat andonly so many leaves of absence you can get from your kids and yourwife before you realize you've had enough.''   Estrich, who is returning to her Harvard Law Schoolprofessorship after a vacation at a Mexican health spa, was thefirst woman to manage a major presidential campaign. She praisedDukakis for giving women leadership roles in politics.   ``But the closer we got to November, the fewer women in theroom. Most of the old hands were male hands,'' Estrich said.   Although campaign bigwigs have secure jobs, others are findingsome employers unimpressed with the Dukakis campaign experience ontheir resumes.   ``I have friends still out of work who run into that attitude,''said one former staffer, who asked not to be named. ``It comes withthe territory of being defeated. It seems to put a tag on you.''</TEXT></DOC>
