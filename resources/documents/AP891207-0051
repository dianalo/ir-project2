But in Cebu, 350 miles south of Manila, about 400 rebels werenot budging from Mactan Air Base, refusing to surrender unless newelections are called to replace Mrs. Aquino, whose term expires inJune 1992.   Civic and religious leaders negotiated with holdouts at Mactan,the last known stronghold of mutineers who launched the coupattempt on Friday.   ``This is unconditional surrender,'' said Brig. Gen. ArturoEnrile, head of the Philippine Military Academy who lednegotiations throughout the night with rebel leaders in thefinancial district. ``The problem is already finished.''   But rebels who marched the 1\ miles back to Fort Bonifacio weresinging and chanting ``No surrender, the fight goes on!'' Troops atthe army base unfurled a white sheet at the gate saying, ``WelcomeHome.''   As the mutineers marched past the exclusive Forbes Parkneighborhood, where U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt lives, someresidents stood on the street and cheered.   ``We have won some victories,'' said rebel Capt. Danilo Lim.``We have made a very strong statement.''   At least 79 people have been killed and more than 570 otherswounded in the coup attempt. It was the bloodiest of the sixattempts to overthrow Mrs. Aquino, who took power in the February1986 civilian-military uprising that toppled the late PresidentFerdinand E. Marcos.   Mrs. Aquino, who faced the gravest crisis of her administration,said she was relieved the siege was over.   ``We must now all join hands and consolidate our resources torebuild what has been destroyed,'' she said in a written statement.   At Mactan Air Base, rebel leader Brig. Gen. Jose Commendadorthreatened to blow up all military aircraft unless his demands weremet.   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa begged Commendadorin a television statement to spare the aircraft, saying they wereneeded for the fight against Communist insurgents.   But as representatives of the two sides watched the telecast inCebu, a rebel officer turned off the set before de Villa appeared.   Cardinal Jaime L. Sin, Roman Catholic archbishop of Manila andthe country's leading cleric, called on todayu his followers tojoin a mass rally Friday in support of democracy.   ``The future of the nation is in your hands,'' Sin said. In1986, hundreds of thousands joined Sin's call to turn out in thestreets to support soldiers who had mutinied against Marcos.   That triggered the ``people power revolution'' Mrs. Aquino rodeto power. But much of her public support has now eroded amidcharges of incompetence and corruption.   On Wednesday, Mrs. Aquino declared a national state of emergencyto deal with the crisis. Her staff was expected to send Congress alist of new powers requested under the emergency decree.   Rebels abandoned Makati a day after about 1,800 foreigners,among them roughly 250 Americans, were evacuated from rebel-heldluxury hotels there.   As they left the skyscrapers and hotels, seized on Saturday, themutineers sang the theme song of their Scout Ranger regiment.Rifles, bazookas, machine guns and bandoleers of ammunition wereslung over their shoulders.   ``We will not surrender, even if it takes forever,'' said Cpl.Roy Bantung. ``The government must change.''   Rebels have accused Mrs. Aquino of failing to stamp outcorruption, reorganize the armed forces and deliver on promises ofsocial justice.   The rebels seized hotels and buildings in Makati on Saturday.The military said about 300 rebels surrendered today, but thenumber appeared to be more than 500.   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos estimated that about 3,000 rebelsjoined the mutiny at its high-point.   On Sunday, Mrs. Aquino ruled out negotiations with the rebelsand warned them ``surrender or die.'' But in the end she relentedand stepped aside to allow loyal military commanders to resolve thecrisis peacefully.   Most rebel officers in past coup attempts have simply beenconfined to barracks, and many enlisted men were sent back into theranks.   Enrile said the rebels' political demands, which included theresignation of Mrs. Aquino, ``were non-negotiable.'' The rebelswere believed to favor a civilian-military junta that would pavethe way for new elections.   On Friday, U.S. F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover for loyalistforces, preventing the insurgents from continuing air strikes fromVillamor Air Base, which the rebels seized in the coup's firsthours.   The U.S. warplanes did not fire on the rebels.   Public confidence has been shaken far more than by the othercoup attempts.   Jose Fernandez, governor of the Central Bank, said Wednesdaythat $91 million had been withdrawn in runs on Manila banks. Manyparts of the archipelago had cash shortages because domestic airservice had been suspended.</TEXT></DOC>
