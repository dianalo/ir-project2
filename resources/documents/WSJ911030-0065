Today, a smallbut increasing number of entrepreneurs are walking through,hoping to make big money with government research.   Unfortunately, a lot of those entrepreneurs are bumpingtheir heads. The Technology Transfer Act of 1986 encouragesthe private sector to commercialize the scientificbreakthroughs of the nation's 500 federal labs, whichcollectively spend $20 billion a year on research. The lawcan be a bonanza for companies savvy enough to negotiatetheir way through the federal bureaucracy all the way to themarketplace.</LP><TEXT>   But it can be a trap for companies that lack the expertiseto deal with the red tape, the foresight to protect their newproducts against copycats, or the judgment to evaluatepotential demand for their innovations.   The federal labs represent &quot;a hell of a reservoir oftechnology,&quot; says William Carpenter, vice president oftechnology transfer at Tennessee's Oak Ridge NationalLaboratory. &quot;But people usually don't understand how immaturethe technology is. It will cost more than they think. It willrequire more management assistance than they think.&quot;   The results of the 1986 law so far have been quite modest,with federal labs taking in only $9.4 million in royaltyincome last year. Nevertheless, interest in licensinggovernment technology has clearly grown. In 1990, federallabs granted 191 licenses to private companies, a 79%increase over the number awarded five years earlier.   Stephen Gates, associate director of the NationalTechnical Information Service, a government licensing arm,says smaller companies account for two-thirds of suchactivity.   Trying to exploit research that isn't protected by patentscan present special risks. Humberto Gerola considered some 25different research projects under way at the RehabilitationResearch andamp; Development Center in Palo Alto, Calif. &quot;A lot ofthem were very attractive but anybody could copy them,&quot; hesays.   Then, &quot;almost by luck,&quot; he says, he found twowell-developed research projects whose details hadn't beenwidely disclosed. Beginning in 1989, he reached agreements tolicense both of them: a portable computer that allowsdisabled people who cannot speak, read or write tocommunicate with symbols; and a voice-controlled robotic workstation that helps quadriplegics perform an array of officechores.   In five years, Mr. Gerola says, the computerized graphicssystem alone could generate annual sales of $50 million.There is a catch, though. His Tolfa Corp. has yet to patenteither idea. &quot;We think we have a good chance,&quot; says Mr.Gerola, whose success depends heavily on receiving suchprotection.   If a technology is patented, deciding the terms of theagreement to license it can take a year. That is longer thansome companies can afford to wait. A General AccountingOffice report blamed bureaucracy for one-third of the failedattempts to transfer technology out of the federal labs. SaysBruce F. Mackler, a Washington lawyer who representsbiotechnology companies: &quot;With the competitiveness in scienceand industry, these delays can be fatal.&quot;   While the bureaucracy can be a burden during negotiations,David Eissenberg says he could have used greater governmentinvolvement after his agreement was signed. In September, Mr.Eissenberg licensed a patent from Oak Ridge that he plans touse for detecting wear in components in nuclear power plants.He predicts that the company he owns, Valvision Inc. inCambridge, N.Y., will complete development of the diagnosticsystem some time next year.   But Mr. Eissenberg has had to look elsewhere for helpfinishing the job. Had he licensed the patent from a privatecompany, &quot;they would have been much more interested in thesuccess of the licensee,&quot; he says. &quot;It would have been acontinuing relationship. In my case there is none, becausethe government really has no incentive to do that.&quot;   Mr. Eissenberg is getting the support he needs from PublicService Electric andamp; Gas Co., a New Jersey utility that issupplying him with funding, research space, equipment andpersonnel. But the arrangement will cost him. In addition toreceiving rights to use Mr. Eissenberg's system, PublicService will also receive a portion of the profits from itssale.   That, of course, assumes there are any profits to share.In the fast-changing world of technology, there's always thechance that the demand an entrepreneur envisions for his newproduct or service will be satisfied by someone else. It is alesson that John Swartz, founder of Lake Shore CryotronicsInc. in Westerville, Ohio, learned the hard way.   When Mr. Swartz approached New Mexico's Los AlamosNational Laboratory in 1988, he foresaw plenty of need forwhat he had in mind. He planned to license a patent withapplications to testing materials used in superconductivity-- which, among other things, could save huge amounts ofenergy lost in electrical transmissions. But after two yearsof developing the idea, Lake Shore discovered that the marketwas saturated with competing methods.   The company is now negotiating with the federal lab togive up its exclusive rights to the patent. In exchange, LosAlamos would slash its royalty payments by $10,000 to $15,000a year. &quot;We were probably six months late in getting thetechnology out there,&quot; says Warren Pierce, a Lake Shore vicepresident. &quot;We just missed the window of opportunity.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
