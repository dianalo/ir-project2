Shayne A. Walters, formerly a salesman for R.R. Donnelley andamp; Sons Co., the magazine's printer, agreed to return $31,033 in profit that he made by trading on the inside information. In addition, he will pay a penalty of that same amount to settle a civil suit filed in federal court in Manhattan.    Mr. Walters, 32 years old, of Laguna Hills, Calif., obtained the information from Business Week's &quot;Inside Wall Street&quot; column before it was made public. Mr. Walters's attorney, Theodore A. Cohen, said his client's case is unrelated to previous insider-trading cases involving Business Week.    Mr. Cohen said Mr. Walters also plans to plead guilty to a criminal count of conspiring to commit fraud and one count of perjury, which were filed in federal court by the U.S. Attorney's Office. Mr. Cohen said the perjury count stems from false statements Mr. Walters made to SEC investigators. The U.S. Attorney's Office said each of those counts carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000.    Mr. Walters personally traded on the securities of 13 companies from October 1986 to May 1987 using the inside information, the SEC said. The agency said Mr. Walters passed the information on to his broker, who traded on the stocks of more than 40 companies from about September 1986 to July 1988. The broker in turn gave the information to other investors, who purchased securities of more than 60 companies while in possession of the inside information. Andrew J. Geist, a staff attorney for the SEC, declined to say whether the broker or the other investors will be charged. Mr. Geist said the investigation is continuing.    The SEC said Mr. Walters received substantial payments from the broker in exchange for the inside information. Mr. Geist declined to say how much Mr. Walters received.    Business Week, owned by McGraw-Hill Inc., is printed at Donnelley's plants in Torrance and in Old Saybrook, Conn., as well as at two plants owned by other companies. In June, the SEC filed a civil suit charging five investors with trading on misappropriated nonpublic information from Business Week before the magazine reached the newsstands. They are accused of buying the advance information from employees at the Old Saybrook plant.    Last December, S.G. &quot;Rudy&quot; Ruderman, a former Business Week radio broadcaster, pleaded guilty to mail fraud for trading on inside information from the &quot;Inside Wall Street&quot; column. </TEXT></DOC>
