<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-80-0883 </DOCNO><TEXT>A three year project for the study of CO/sub 2/ corrosion of carbon steelswas sponsored by five oil companies. Corrosion takes place without anFeCO/sub 3/ corrosion film if the FE/sup 2+/ ions in the water is inthe solubility range. The corrosion rate was found to increase proportionallywith CO/sub 2/ partial pressures to a power of about 0.7. A new featurerevealed is that the amount of Fe/sup 2+/ corrosion products in the wateris equally important as the CO/sub 2/ level. Low concentrations of FE/sup2+/ and high CO/sub 2/ levels can lead to rapid corrosion. A surprisingobservation is that carbon manganese steels with about the same compositionexhibited differences in the corrosion rate with a factor up to 4 inloop experiments at temperature from 60-90{sup 0}C. This was, amongstothers, a result of a minor amount of chromium (up to 0.22%) in the so-calledunalloyed carbon steels. Also the response to flow variations was differentfor the different steels.</TEXT></DOC>
