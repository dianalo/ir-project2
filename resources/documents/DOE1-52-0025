Identification of IVC-RA relation could be performedcorrectly in all cases. Atrio-ventriclar relation was determined 7 of8 patients. In case 4, tricuspid atresia was proposed by the time intensitycurve, but this case was severe tricuspid stenosis by cineangiography.Ventriclo-arterial relation was determined 6 of 8 cases. In case 1, aROI was set in main pulmonary artery, but the time intensity curve wasnot clear because of hyopoplastic pulmonary artery. In case 3, 8, theorigin of pulmonary artery was not clear. In all patients except case1, both great arteries were detected at same time by the time intensitycurve. This experience suggests that DSA is a useful method in a diagnosisof complex congenital heart disease.</TEXT></DOC>
