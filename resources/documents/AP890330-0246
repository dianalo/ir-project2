Businessland, which had $1.2 billion in sales last year, is thenation's biggest retailer for desktop computers for businesses.Industry members characterized the deal as a major coup for Jobs'3-year-old company, founded after he was ousted as president ofApple Computer Inc. in 1985.   ``In one fell swoop, Jobs has come up with a clean,high-quality, professional distribution network that is the envy ofeveryone. At the very least, it's a nice first move for a newcompany,'' said Wood Lotz, president of Michigan-based Absoft,which also unveiled its Next-compatible software.   The computer system _ which includes an erasable optical-diskdrive with storage compacity for 200,000 typewritten pages _ willsell for $9,995. It was offered to universities for $6,500.   Since unveiling the sleek computer in a black-magnesium case sixmonths ago, Jobs has maintained he would sell initially only touniversities.   But at a glitzy news conference on an enclosed pier on SanFrancisco Bay, Jobs said school officials across the countryencouraged him to get his system onto the retail market nearly ayear earlier than he had planned.   ``They told us they think we've got a revolutionary product, butthey said we've got to get it out into a broader market so theirstudents will see it when they get into the workplace aftergraduating,'' Jobs said.   The worldwide market for general purpose and technicalworkstations _ high-powered desktop computers that range in costfrom $8,000 to $80,000 _ is estimated at $4 billion and growingrapidly. Such machines give desktop users vastly improved abilitiesover standard personal computers, particularly in visual displays,speed and mathematical calculations.   The market is expected to reach $20 billion by the early 1990s,and major semiconductor and computer manufacturers are jockeyingfor a share.   Analysts say Jobs' move is a big step toward carving out a majorrole for his company in the field of computers that use AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s Unix operating system software.   Jobs predicted the Next's Unix-based operating system willbecome standard in the industry because of its speed, power andversatility.   Analysts hailed the Businessland deal for giving Jobs' PaloAlto-based company greater visibility, speeding up development ofsoftware and dealing a blow to rival Sun Microsystems Inc., whichalso had been negotiating for distribution with Businessland.   ``Next is now openly competing against players in the broaddesktop marketplace, and I believe for that market they've createda machine that is extremely attractive,'' said Jonathan Seybold, aleading industry expert.   In response to some criticism there is comparatively littlesoftware available for the Next, Seybold said that should beexpected from a machine on the leading edge of technology.   Jobs also announced software development is already under way atseveral companies, including Adobe Systems Inc., Lotus DevelopmentCorp. and Sybase Inc. Some 15 other companies demonstrated programsalready written for the Next after the news conference.   The Next is Jobs' first product since he left Apple ComputerInc., which he co-founded in the 1970s in a garage.   Over the last three months, Jobs said 1,000 computers have beenshipped from Next's fully robotic factory in Fremont, Calif., tomore than 60 of the country's major universities.   Next also has trained more than 200 software writers on itsoperating system, Jobs said.</TEXT></DOC>
