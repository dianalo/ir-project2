(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The retired commander of a NATO intelligencegathering post said he noticed a drop in material from East Blocsources in late 1985 and 1986, when two men accused of passingsecrets to East Germany were working at the base.   Retired Col. Kenneth Roney's testimony Monday came on the openingday of the federal trial of Huseyin Yildirim, 61, who is accused ofscheming with Army Warrant Officer James William Hall III to providemilitary secrets to the Soviets and East Germans.   Yildirim worked as a civilian mechanic at an Army auto shop inWest Berlin during Hall's time at the field station.   Army intelligence experts said the operation funneled informationabout the West's eavesdropping capabilities to East German andSoviet agents for more than six years. They said the case appearedto have inflicted serious damage to electronic spying efforts inEurope.   Roney, who was commander of the Berlin field station from 1984 to1986, testified that toward the end of his command he noticed areduction in the amount of material coming to the Berlin listeningbase from Eastern bloc sources.   Roney also testified that Hall, Yildirim's allegedco-conspirator, attracted his attention at Field Station Berlin in1986 because he owned a $21,000 1985 Volvo 760 GLE auto. Roney saidhe was hesitating about buying the same model on his colonel'ssalary.   The government is prosecuting Yildirim while trying to avoiddisclosing details about the intelligence operations he is accusedof harming. Two experts at the trial, representing the DefenseDepartment's national security interests, effectively were servingas censors.   During Roney's testimony, the experts objected to several defensequestions regarding the operation of Field Station Berlin.   ``Did anyone under your command engage in counter-espionageactivities?'' asked defense attorney Lamar Walter. Roney was notallowed to answer because the security advisers said the responsemight include classified information.   In opening arguments, assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Kramer saidthe intelligence operation that the two men are accused of violatingwas needed to overcome the Warsaw Pact's edge in conventional forcesin Europe.   ``What is required to equalize the balance is information,''Kramer said.   Walter said his client ``did not participate in this conspiracyto the extent he should be charged.''   ``I know some of you read spy novels. You never know what theconclusion is until you read the last chapter,'' Walter told thejury, adding that Hall did most of the work.   The trial is being held in Savannah since Hall was stationed atnearby Fort Stewart at the time of his arrest. Kramer said Hall, whowas court-martialed in March, will be a government witness againstYildirim. Hall, 30, was sentenced to 40 years in prison and fined$50,000.   Hall pleaded guilty to 10 counts of espionage, attemptedespionage and failing to obey Army regulations. He was dishonorablydischarged and forfeited all future Army pay and allowances. Halladmitted to Army officials he received more than $100,000 between1983 and 1988 to provide classified documents to Eastern bloc agents.   Yildirim, identified in court documents as Meister Bie or MikeJones _ the man Hall identified as his conduit of classifiednational defense documents to East Germans _ is charged withconspiring with Hall to provide classified information from 1983 to1988. Hall was named as a co-conspirator in Yildirim's indictment.   Yildirim has been held in seclusion since his arrest at hisBelleair Beach, Fla., home in December.</TEXT></DOC>
