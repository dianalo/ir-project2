Kemal Ebcioglu said Thursday he created the software to helpunderstand Bach's style more precisely _ and to help explore thefrontiers of computer science.   The musical work led to the creation of a programming languagethat could be adapted for other jobs requiring heavy computation,such as deciphering the molecular structure of genes, Ebcioglu said.   Although other computer programs can be used to compose music,the IBM software is the only one to duplicate the Bach choralestyles, Ebcioglu said.   The program, called Choral, adds bass, tenor and alto parts tochorale melodies that are written for soprano. It is not intendedas a commercial product because of its limited usefulness and itshuge appetite for computing power.   Ebcioglu, who holds a master's degree in music and a doctoratein computer science, said the software uses more than 350compositional rules that he programmed into it based on years ofstudy of Bach's chorales.   A chorale harmonization of 20 bars requires about 30 minutes ofcomputing time and 23 billion simple instructions on one of IBM'sgiant 3090 series of mainframe computers, a measure of thecomplexity of Bach's music.   Choral would probably receive an above-average to excellentgrade in a college composition class, said Ebcioglu.   ``It is unknown to what degree we can replicate human creativityby a computer. But what we can do is impose much higher standardson computer-created music,'' said Ebcioglu.   Choral builds a harmonization stage by stage. It backtracks andchanges notes that it considers to be responsible for a dead-endwhen the dead-end is encountered. In that way, it resembles ananimal negotiating a maze.   Many kinds of scientific research involve similar searches.Ebcioglu's new programming language, Backtracking SpecificationLanguage, simplifies the search process.   Bach's chorale style was relatively easy to replicate because itis well-understood, Ebcioglu said. He said other natural candidatesfor expert systems programs would be Antonio Vivaldi and FranzJoseph Haydn.   Compositional rules by themselves cannot produce beautifulmusic, Ebcioglu said. Composers use additional knowledge _ talent _for choosing among the many theoretically possible extensions of aparticular composition.   Ebcioglu said he came up with a good approximation of talent bybuilding a large number of precise guidelines based on anunderstanding of Bach's style.   Ebcioglu works at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center inYorktown Heights, N.Y.</TEXT></DOC>
