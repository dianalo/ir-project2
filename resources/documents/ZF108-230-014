General Accounting Office.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The ABCs of Filing a Bid Protest With GAOandM;Many federal procurement officials have complained that contractors file toomany protests and thereby undermine the government's efforts to acquire thebest system for the dollar.andM;They may be right, but some vendors have claimed that government regulationsand practices force them to file protests in an effort to open up theprocurement process.andM;Whatever the cause, protests are here to stay.andP;  Consequently it behoovesvendors and government contracting officials to know the details of how thebid protest process works.andM;In this column and my next column I will focus on how to file a bid protestwith the General Accounting Office.andM;To file a bid protest at GAO, you must submit a written protest with GAO'sOffice of General Counsel.andP;  This filing must contain a detailed statement ofthe grounds for protest.andM;Report Is Made AvailableandM;The agency that awarded the contract will furnish a report to GAO on theprocurement and will provide a copy of its report to the protester forcomment.andP;  Other interested parties also may receive copies of the protest andthe agency report for comments.andM;In some cases, GAO attorneys may hold an informal conference in which theprotester presents its arguments.andP;  Or they may hold a fact findingconference.andP;  This differs from the informal conference in that witnessestestify under oath and the proceedings are transcribed.andM;After the record is complete, GAO will consider the facts and issue adecision.andP;  A copy of the decision is sent to the protester, to interestedparties and to the agency involved.andM;It usually takes up to 90 working days from the date of the filing to thedate of the decision.andM;Although most of the protests GAO considers involve the acceptance orrejection of a bid or proposal, the agency also handles protests againstsolicitation defects such as alleged restrictive specifications, omission ofa required provision, or ambiguous or indefinite evaluation factors.andM;Protests involving different procurements must be separately filed, and GAOonly allows one protest submission per package or envelope.andM;There are some protests, however, that GAO cannot consider.andM;* The agency will not consider protests that already have been filed with theGeneral Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals.andP;  A vendor canprotest most of ADP procurements either to GAO or GSBCA.andP;  But once a protestis filed with GSBCA.andP;  GAO will not consider a protest involving thatprocurement, even from another party, while the GSBCA protest is pending.andM;The party that filed a protest with the GSBCA may not protest the same matterto GAO under any circumstances.andM;* GAO does not consider protest questioning an ageny determination that acompany is not a responsible bidder, except in cases when there is suspicionof possible fraud or bad faith on the part of the agency.andP;  GAO will notconsider a protest when the matter involved also is the subject of a lawsuit.andM;* Cases that involve contract administration cannot be protested to GAO.andO;Contract administration includes disputes arising during contractperformance, such as whether the contractor is entitled to additionalcompensation.andM;* GAO usually does not consider protests of decisions to place or not place acontract with a socially or economically disadvantaged company under theSmall Business Administration's section 8(a) program.andP;  GAO will review thematter if the protester can show there is possible fraud or bad faith on thepart of the government officials or that regulations may have been violated.andM;* The only time GAO considers protests against subcontract awards is when acontractor makes the award for the government, such as when a contractor actsas a purchasing agent.andM;* GAO has no authority to issue decisions on bid protests involvingprocurement actions of organizations or activities that are not federalagencies.andP;  These include the U.S.andP;  Postal Service, the government of PuertoRico, the government of the District of Columbia, and government corporationssuch as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporations that are not wholly ownedby the government.andM;Protests must be filed in writing and addressed to the General Counsel,General Accounting Office, 441 St. N.W., Washington, D.C.andP;  20548, Attention:Procurement Law Control Group.andM;The protester must file a copy of the protest with the contracting officerwithin one day after it is filed with GAO.andM;In my next column, I will discuss the mechanics of filing a protest with GAO.andM;William N. Hunter, Ph.D., is a 10-year veteran of the Office of Managementand Budget, where he was director of the Federal Acquisition Institute.andP;  Heis founder of W N Hunter andamp; Associates, a Vienna, Va., management consultingfirm specializing in federal procurement policy.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
