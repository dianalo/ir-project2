The cast incased the man from ankles to mid-trunk, SanduskyCounty Jail Administrator Robert Pollard said Thursday.   ``It was a full-body cast because he had a pin in his femur,''the bone extending from hip to knee, said Pollard. ``It was designedto immobilize him.''   The suspect, Robert Chavez, 19, was last seen Saturday at hismobile home, where he was recuperating from a broken hip and otherinjuries incurred when police shot him in the left leg and leftbuttocks during a chase Nov. 21, said Sheriff David Gangwer.   Chavez was indicted on five counts of aggravated burglary and onecount of felonious assault, court records showed. Detectives wentlooking for him after he failed to show up for a court hearingTuesday, Gangwer said.   Doctors told authorities in December Chavez would have to wearthe cast until March, said Gangwer.   But a resident of Chavez's mobile home park told authorities hefound a discarded body cast in a trash bin about two weeks ago, thesheriff said, adding that a pair of crutches was missing from themobile home park.   ``We're looking for a guy on crutches that's moving like amole,'' said a sheriff's detective who did not give his name.</TEXT></DOC>
