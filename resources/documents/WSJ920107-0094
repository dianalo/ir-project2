People familiar with the forced sale of what was once thecountry's 14th largest thrift said a transaction could beannounced as early as Friday. Federal regulators said lastsummer they were seeking a buyer for CrossLand after mountingreal estate losses caused the institution to fail to meetcapital requirements.</LP><TEXT>   Rather than seize the bank's assets, the governmentplanned on a swift sale to an outside buyer, but the sale hastaken longer than expected. If no deal can be reached, afederal takeover is still possible.   CrossLand's value lies in its extensive branch network,principally in the New York City metropolitan area, and about$6 billion in retail deposits. In addition to its 44 New Yorkstate branches, CrossLand owns five branches in New Jerseyand about 35 in Utah, Florida, California, and Virginia.   A CrossLand spokesman declined to discuss the situation,as did spokesmen for Chase and Republic.   For the first nine months of 1991, CrossLand posted lossesof $308 million, while its asset base shrunk from $11.7billion to 9.2 billion. The asset base shrunk further withthe November sale of 25 Crossland offices in Washington andOregon to Washington Mutual Savings Bank. At the end of thethird quarter, CrossLand's nonperforming assets stood at$1.55 billion.   Meanwhile, many CrossLand executives are said to bepreparing to leave the institution. Individuals in the realestate industry said President Robert Goldstein would resignhis position soon.   Mr. Goldstein is a veteran of Texas banking who joinedCrossLand last year in a move to reverse the thrift's sinkingfortunes. His departure from the thrift was widely expectedafter the federal government announced over the summer thatit would seek a buyer for CrossLand.   Mr. Goldstein did not return a phone call.   CrossLand was an aggressive lender to New York City realestate projects in the late 1980s, at the precise time themarket turned sour. Today, the bank's borrowers have a longlist of unsold condominium projects with suchoptimistic-sounding names as the Pinnacle, and the Future.   In April, the federal Office of Thrift Supervisionapproved a recapitalization plan that would have increasedthe thrift's capital by about $500 million. The approval waslater withdrawn.   In one proposal under consideration by the federal Officeof Thrift Supervision, the depositary assets would bepurchased by an outside bank, and the non-performing loanswould be taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
