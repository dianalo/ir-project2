No. 315,302, filed Feb.      24, 1989 now U.S. Pat. No. 4,981,618. </PAR></PARN><BSUM> <PAC>  FIELD OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to new sphingophospholipids containing      inositol, to methods by means of which they may be obtained, as well as to      their application by way of inducers of resistance in plants capable of      being infested by pathogenic fungi, in particular in cereals, such as      wheat and corn, Solanaceae, such as capsicum, tomato and tobacco, and      Cucurbitaceae, such melon, with respect to their natural parasites. These      new sphingophospholipids according to the invention are also effective, in      the absence of pathogenic fungi, to enhance the metabolism and physiology      of the healthy plant. </PAR><PAR>  The term &quot;inducer of resistance&quot; is understood to mean a substance      synthesized by the fungus, participating in the host-parasite interaction      and capable of inducing, in the plant, a state of resistance or of      triggering phenomena associated with this resistance. Such substances are      also designated by the term &quot;elicitor&quot;, which had been introduced      initially to describe substances capable of inducing the production of      phytoalexins (antibiotic defence substances) in plants when they are      attacked by a bacterium or a fungus. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, the agricultural importance of isolating such eliciting agents is      that their controlled application to plants leads the latter to defend      themselves against their natural parasites, where appropriate through the      intervention of phytoalexins. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE ART </PAC><PAR>  Shortly after the isolation and characterization of the first phytoalexins,      it was shown that pycelial extracts of Monilia fructicola, a fruit tree      pathogen, contained a peptide, referred to as monilicolin A, capable of      inducing the accumulation of phaseolin (phytoalexin) in the endocarp of      the beam phaseolus vulgaris andlsqb;Cruickshank and Perrin, Life Sciences, 7,      449-458 (1968)andrsqb;. Since this study, many eliciting preparations have been      isolated, but they have essentially been partially purified fractions. In      effect, the purification of elicitor molecules from crude fungal extracts      is complicated by response curves that are multiphasic or variable      according to the dose applied, the partial or total loss of activity, the      response resulting from the interaction of different compounds present in      the mixture, or quite simply the chemical nature of the elicitors. </PAR><PAR>  In the Phytophthora capsici--Capsicum system, Capsicum cotyledons, kept      alive on the fungal culture filtrate, exhibit a lower sensitivity with      respect to this pathogen andlsqb;Molot et al. Annales de Phytopathologie, 12,      95-107 (1980)andrsqb;. An identical effect may be obtained using isolated      fractions of culture filtrates or of the mycelium andlsqb;Molot et al., Annales      de Phytopathologie, 12, 379-387 (1980); Coulomb et al., Comptes Rendus de      l'Academie des Sciences de Paris, series D, 290, 275-277(1980)andrsqb;. </PAR><PAR>  Molot et al. have observed that, in capsicum, the reaction is not      accompanied by any accumulation of phytoalexin andlsqb;Agronomie, 4, 829-833      (1984); Phytopathologische Zeitschrift, 112, 268-276 (1985)andrsqb;. Other      defence mechanisms must hence be envisaged. </PAR><PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The analysis of the mycelial extracts of different strains of Phytophthora      has enabled the Applicant to discover new elicitor molecules which are      sphingophospholipids containing inositol, which have been obtained in the      form of mixtures with one another (sphingophospholipid fraction) and which      it has been possible to isolate in the pure state. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIGS. 1 to 3 are elution curves on a column of Bio Sil HA silicic acid. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a non-lipid analysis on silica gel 60. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a mass spectrum showing fragmentations characteristic of      sphingoid derivatives. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is the spectrum obtained with C.sub.18 -sphingosine. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is the chromatogram obtained from the methyl esters. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 shows the mass spectra of the methyl esters of hexadecanoic (a),      eicosanoic (b), docosenoic (c), docosanoic (d) and hydroxydocosenoic (e)      acids. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 shows the mass spectra of the phospholipid with FAB </PAR><PA2>  (a) Positive FAB </PA2><PA2>  (b) Negative FAB </PA2><PAR>  FIG. 10 summarizes the different stages of degradation of the phospholipid. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 11 is the infrared spectrum of phospholipid isolated from Phytophthora      capsici. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 12 is a chromatogram of the ceramide. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 13, 15a and 15b show fragmentation with positive FAB. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 14 and 16A show spectra obtained with negative FAB. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 16b shows a large fragmentation of the sphingosine. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 17 and 18 show elution profiles of the lipids. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 19 shows the relationship between the sensitivity of the capsicum      cotyledons and the phospholipid concentration. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The subject of the present invention is hence, in the first place, the new      sphingophospholipids containing inositol, represented by the general      formula (I):      ##STR3## </PAR><PAR>  in which Z denotes the residues:      ##STR4## </PAR><PAR>  The invention relates more especially to the new sphingophospholipid      containing inositol of formula (Ia):      ##STR5##      whose molecular mass is 849 daltons and which has proved to be very      active. </PAR><PAR>  The invention also relates to all sphingolipid fractions consisting of      mixtures of at least two different compounds of formula (I), as defined      above, and, as a specially preferred category, to sphingolipid fractions      consisting of a major proportion of the compound of formula (Ia) and a      minor proportion of at least one other compound of formula (I), as defined      above, in other words at least one ceramide composed of C.sub.16      -sphingosine and of a fatty acid corresponding to a hydroxydocosanoic acid      (Mandequals;851 d) or to a hydroxydocosadienoic acid (Mandequals;847 d) or to a docosenoic      acid (Mandequals;833 d):      ##STR6## </PAR><PAR>  Sphingolipids containing inositol are quite widely represented in nature,      especially in plants, yeasts, bacteria and fungi. However, few structures      are known. In fungi, the long-chain base is generally represented by      C.sub.18 -sphingosine or C.sub.18 -phytosphingosine; the most common fatty      acids are C.sub.26 acids hydroxylated at the 2-position andlsqb;Laine, Chemistry      and Physics of Lipids 42, 129-135 (1986)andrsqb;. The sphingophospholipids      containing inositol according to the present invention hence represent a      new molecule as a result of the presence of C.sub.16 -sphingosine. The      preferred compound, of formula (Ia), is also novel as a result of the      existence of a 4-hydroxy acid. </PAR><PAR>  The subject of the present invention is also a method for preparing the      sphingolipid fractions as defined above and the compounds of general      formula (I) as defined above, in which method: </PAR><PA1>  in a first stage, a mycelial extract of Phytophthora is prepared, the said      extract showing a resistance-inducing activity in a plant capable of being      infested by a pathogen belonging to the species Phytophtora; </PA1><PA1>  in a second stage, an extraction of the total lipids of the said mycelial      extract is carried out; and </PA1><PA1>  in a third stage, a fractionation of these lipids is carried out by      adsorption chromatography on silicic acid, in order to collect the      fractions retaining the major part of the initial activity, </PA1><PAL>  additional purifications leading to the production of the desired compound      of formula (I). </PAL><PAR>  Generally speaking, the sphingolipid fractions as defined above and the      compounds of general formula (I) as defined above may be prepared by      extracting the mycelial lipids of Phytophthora to obtain the same      fractions, additional purifications leading to the production of the      desired compound of formula (I). </PAR><PAR>  The sphingolipid fractions as defined above and the compounds of general      formula (I) as defined above may also be prepared in the following manner: </PAR><PA1>  in a first stage, grinding of the mycelium of Phytophthora is carried out      and the suspension is filtered to collect, on the one hand the crude      mycelial walls, and on the other hand a mycelial filtrate, which      constitute desired fractions; and </PA1><PA1>  in a second stage, extraction of the wall lipids is carried out, these      lipids also constituting desired fractions, </PA1><PAL>  additional purifications of the above mentioned fractions leading to the      production of the desired compound of formula (I). </PAL><PAR>  The purifications of the sphingolipid fractions are advantageously      performed by adsorption chromatography on silicic acid. </PAR><PAR>  In all the methods mentioned above, mycelium of Phytophthora capsici or of      Phytophthora parasitica is advantageously used as starting material. </PAR><PAR>  The invention also relates to the application of the compounds of formula      (I) as defined above and the sphingolipid fractions as defined above, by      way of agents inducing resistance to cryptogamic diseases in plants      capable of being infested by a pathogenic fungus, in particular for the      purpose of protecting cereals and plants belonging to the Solanaceae and      Cucurbitaceae families. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, there may be mentioned, by way of example, the protection of wheat      with respect to cryptogamic diseases of the aerial part, provoked for      example by Septoria nodorum  and Erysiphe graminis, and of diseases      provoked by root fungi such as Gaemannomyces graminis; of capsicum with      respect to Phytophthora capsici; of melon with respect to      Pseudoperonospora cubensis; of tomato with respect to Phytophthora      infestans; and of &quot;Xanthi&quot; tobacco with respect to Phytophthora parasitica      va. nicotianae. The effective protection of major crop plants, such as      wheat, that can be obtained with the compounds and sphingolipid fractions      of the invention is of very great importance. </PAR><PAR>  Another advantage of the elicitors according to the present invention is      the systemic nature of the protection. In other words, the application of      the elicitor on a particular part of the plant (its foliage, for example)      leads to a total protection of the latter, both of its aerial system and      of its root system. Furthermore, the plant which is treated with the      sphingophospholipids according to the invention is protected during all      its life. In the same way, the treatment of the seed protects the plant      during all its life. </PAR><PAR>  Yet another advantage of the elicitors of the invention is that they exert      a physiological effect on the healthy plant material, manifesting itself,      in particular, in an improvement of the vegetative state, an earlier      maturation, a rise in the chlorophyll content and a modified size, for a      better grain yield, for example. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention hence also relates to an eliciting composition, which      contains, as active ingredient, at least one compound of formula (I), as      defined above, or at least one sphingolipid fraction, as defined above, in      a medium acceptable in agriculture. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, the composition according to the invention is advantageously present      in a form suitable for spraying on the aerial system of a plant, or for      dipping a seed of the said plant in said composition, or alternatively for      coating the said seed in the wet state with the said composition, the      concentration of the latter being, in particular, from about 1 to 25      .mu.g/ml in the case of the treatment of the aerial system of the plant,      and from about 1 to 10 .mu.g/ml in the case of a treatment by dipping or      coating of the seed. Since the compounds of formula (I) are, for the most      part, insoluble in water, they are generally made into a milky suspension      by passage through a homogenized (Ultra-Turrax). </PAR><PAR>  The subject of the present invention is finally a method for treating a      plant, in particular for protecting this plant with respect to a      pathogenic fungus or several pathogenic fungi by inducing in it resistance      to these fungi, or, in the absence of pathogenic fungus or fungi, for      enhancing the metabolism and physiology of the healthy plant, wherein an      eliciting composition as defined above is applied by spraying on the      aerial system of the plant. </PAR><PAR>  In the case of wheat, a spraying is performed on the wheat at the end of      tillering and/or the beginning of bolting. </PAR><PAR>  The invention also relates to a method for treating a plant, in particular      for protecting this plant with respect to a pathogenic fungus or several      pathogenic fungi by inducing in it resistance to these fungi, or, in the      absence of pathogenic fungus or fungi, for enhancing the metabolism and      physiology of the healthy plant, wherein the seed of the said plant is      left to swell for a period of time between 24 and 48 hours in an eliciting      composition as defined above (complete impregnation of the seed), or      alternatively a coating of the integument is carried out by the wet      method, by mixing the said seed with the said eliciting composition. </PAR><PAR>  A detailed description will now be given of the isolation of the      sphingophospholipids containing inositol of the present invention from the      mycelium of Phytophthora capsici and the characterization of these new      substances (example 1), and two other method of obtaining      sphingophospholipids of the invention (examples 2 and 3), as well as their      resistance-inducing activity in certain plants, by way of examples      (examples 4 and 5). </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAC>  A. ISOLATION AND PURIFICATION OF THE ELICITING PHOSPHOLIPIDS ACCORDING TO      THE INVENTION IN THE MICELIUM OF PHYTOPHTHORA CAPSICI </PAC><PAC>  First Stage </PAC><PAC>  Isolation of a mycelial extract of Phytophthora capsici. </PAC><PAR>  The starting mycelium is derived from a Phytophthora capsici culture      performed on Messiaen-Lafon synthetic medium andlsqb;Molot et al., Annales de      Phytopathologie, 12, 95-107 and 379-387 (1980)andrsqb;. </PAR><PAR>  This mycelial extract (ME) is prepared according to the following protocol:      ##STR7## </PAR><PAR>  The wet mycelium is ground in eight volumes of 95% strength ethanol. After      filtration, an alcoholic extract is obtained, which is concentrated to      dryness and then taken up with water. This new preparation is extracted      successively three times with n-butanol and then once with absolute      alcohol. The fraction insoluble in alcohol is taken up with water and then      lyophilized. It represents the mycelial extract ME. </PAR><PAC>  Second Stage </PAC><PAC>  Extraction of the total lipids present in the mycelial extract (ME)      according to the method of Folch andlsqb;Journal of Biological Chemistry, 226,      497-509(1957)andrsqb;. </PAC><PAR>  The mycelial extract (ME) prepared in the preceding stage is suspended in a      chloroform/methanol/water (40:20:15; v/v/v) mixture, in a (1:300; g/ml)      ratio. After agitation for 48 hours at room temperature, and allowing      settling to occur, the lipid compounds are separated from the      water-soluble and glycoconjugate fractions which are solubilized in the      upper phase of the solvent. </PAR><PAC>  Third Stage </PAC><PAC>  Fractionation of the lipids by two successive adsorption </PAC><PAC>  chromatographic runs </PAC><PAR>  (a) Chromatography on a column of Mallinckrodt silicic acid/Celite 545      (3:1; m/m) </PAR><PAR>  The organic extract (OE) obtained in the preceding stage is fractionated by      adsorption chromatography on a column of Mallinckrodt silicic acid (152      .mu.m-100 mesh), activated for 15 hours at 100.degree.

It contains a nitrogen compound      belonging to the sphingoid group and identified with C.sub.16      -sphingosine.

Alkaline hydrolyses of the phospholipid of the invention </PAR><PAR>  a) Mild alkaline hydrolysis </PAR><PAR>  It was confirmed that the phospholipid of the invention, which contains a      long-chain aminated base, is a sphingophospholipid. This phospholipid was      subjected to an alkaline hydrolysis under the conditions of Smith and      Lester andlsqb;Journal of Biological Chemistry 249, 3395-3405 (1974andrsqb;, these      conditions not degrading phospholipids. It is hydrolyzed with 0.2N      methanolic sodium hydroxide at 30.degree. C. for 20 minutes. The reaction      medium is neutralized with acetic acid and then extracted with chloroform.      The chloroform extracts are analyzed by thin layer chromatography (HPTLC)      in the solvent of Heape et al. After visualization with the reagent of      Dittmer and Lester, modified by Vaskovsky and Kostetsky, it is found that      the hydrolyzate gives a single spot of the same Rf as the corresponding      native phospholipid. </PAR><PAR>  Mild alkaline hydrolysis has hence not liberated any component of the      phospholipid being studied, thereby demonstrating that the latter is a      sphingophospholipid, for which the following two partial structures may be      proposed:      ##STR10## </PAR><PAR>  The position of the inositol was determined by FAB mass spectrometry. </PAR><PAR>  b) Saponification of the phospholipid with 1N aqueous potassium hydroxide. </PAR><PAR>  The phospholipid being studied was subjected to an alkaline hydrolysis      under conditions which cleave the phosphate ester bond, liberating the      ceramide and enabling the position of the inositol molecule to be      specified. </PAR><PAR>  4 mg of this phospholipid are saponified with 1.5 ml of 1N aqueous      potassium hydroxide at 37.degree. C. for 15 hours. After the mixture is      cooled, the lipids are extracted with chloroform; the aqueous phase is      neutralized with amberlite IRC-50. </PAR><PAR>  b-1) Analysis of the water-soluble fraction </PAR><PAR>  The aqueous phase of the 1N potassium hydroxide hydrolyzate is analyzed by      gas chromatography, before and after hydrochloric acid hydrolysis,      reduction and acetylation. A peak is observed whose retention time      corresponds to that of inositol acetate only on the chromatogram obtained      with the hydrolyzed extract. The alkaline hydrolysis of the phospholipid      has hence not liberated the bond in which the inositol is engaged. It was      demonstrated by the action of alkaline phosphatase that it was linked to      the phosphate group. </PAR><PAR>  The aqueous extract obtained after alkaline hydrolysis of the phospholipid      is treated with alkaline phosphatase. The reaction medium is analysed by      gas chromatography after reduction and acetylation. The presence of a peak      corresponding to inositol acetate, a peak absent before enzymatic      hydrolysis, is observed on the chromatogram obtained. </PAR><PAR>  b-2) Study of the lipid-soluble fraction </PAR><PAR>  b-2.alpha.) Isolation of the ceramide </PAR><PAR>  The lipids present in the chloroform extracts are separated on a column of      Bio Sil HA silicic acid with the following elution solvents: chloroform,      chloroform/methanol containing from 5 to 50% of methanol. Each fraction      collected is analyzed by thin layer chromatography on silica gel 60 (Merck      5628) in Karlson's solvent andlsqb;Journal of lipid Research, 12, 466-472 (1971)andrsqb;      modified by Ohnishi andlsqb;Agricultural and Biological Chemistry, 40,      1419-1423andrsqb;. The fractions eluted with chloroform containing 25 to 50% of      methanol contain the unhydrolyzed phospholipid, and the fractions eluted      with chloroform contain the ceramide (Rfandequals;0.69). The fatty acids have not      been liberated, thereby demonstrating that the carboxyl group is not      engaged in an ester bond in the phospholipid molecule. This enables the      formula (1) to be eliminated and the above mentioned partial structure (2)      to be proposed. </PAR><PAR>  b-2.beta.) Methanolysis of the ceramide </PAR><PAR>  The methanolysis of the ceramide with 2N methanolic HCl at 80.degree. C.      under reflux for 5 hours liberates the aminated base extracted from the      hydrolyzate by chloroform after alkalinization of the medium and      identified by HPTLC with C.sub.16 -sphingosine, and fatty acids. The      latter are analysed by gas chromatography of the methyl esters. The      chromatogram illustrated in FIG. 12 shows that the ceramide contains the      same fatty acids as the phospholipid of the invention, and in the same      proportions. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE 9                                                          ______________________________________                                         Comparative analysis of the content of fatty acids present                     in the ceramide and the phospholipid of the invention,                         which are derived from Phytophthora capsici                                                Mol % of the total fatty acids                                     Fatty acids             Phospholipid of                                        identified    Ceramide  the invention                                                                              Peak No.                                   ______________________________________                                         Hexadecanoic acid                                                                            23.0      26.2        1                                          Octadecenoic acid                                                                            3.7       5.7         2                                          Octadecanoic acid                                                                            2.9       2.8         3                                          Eicosanoic acid                                                                              15.0      11.6        4                                          Docosenoic acid                                                                              34.2      33.2        5                                          Docosanoic acid                                                                              18.0      16.1        6                                          Hydroxydecosenoic acid                                                                       3.2       4.3         7                                          ______________________________________                                     </TBL><PAR>  b-2.gamma.)

Three fractions are      collected, OEM.sub.I, OEM.sub.II and OEM.sub.III, eluted with chloroform,      chloroform/methanol (75:5; v/v) and chloroform/methanol (50:50; v/v),      respectively. These fractions represent 12.5%, 1.7% and 0.3%,      respectively, with respect to the lyophilized mycelium in the case of      extraction of the mycelial lipids of Phytophthora capsici strain 197, and      11.2%, 1.9% and 0.2%, respectively, with respect to the lyophilized      mycelium in the case of the extraction of mycelial lipids of Phytophthora      capsici strain 15.12 A. </PAR><PAR>  The fractions OEM.sub.I, OEM.sub.II and OEM.sub.III were analysed by      chromatography on silica gel 60 plates (Merck 5628).

The      non-sedimented fractions represent 36.7% of the mycelium of strain 197 and      59.7% of the mycelium of strain 15.12 A. </PAR><PAR>  The lipids present in these fractions are extracted for 48 hours with a      chloroform/methanol/water (40:20:15; v/v/v) mixture. They represent 0.6      and 0.5% of the fresh mycelium of strains 197 and 15.12 A of the      Phytophthora capsici. A delipidation of the walls is performed with a      chloroform/methanol (2:1; v/v) mixture. The lipids obtained represent 0.3%      of the fresh mycelium for the two strains studied. They are fractionated      by chromatography on a column of Mallinckrodt silicic acid/Celite 545      (3:1; m/m). Eight fractions are eluted with increasing contents of      methanol in chloroform. The elution profiles of the lipids are shown in      FIGS. 17 and 18. Each of the fractions isolated is analysed by thin layer      chromatography on silica gel 60 (Merck 5628) in the solvent of Heape et      al., in the presence of the phospholipid of formula (Ia) as a control. The      reagent of Dittman and Lester modified by Vaskovsky and Kostetsky      demonstrates the presence of a phospholipid of formula (Ia) in the organic      extracts of the mycelial filtrate, and also in the wall lipids WL.sub. E,      WL.sub.F and WL.sub.G of the two strains. This study shows that the      phospholipid of formula (Ia) is a component of the mycelial wall, of which      it represents 5 to 10% of the lipids. </PAR><PAR>  In the same way, the sphingophospholipid of formula (Ia) was also found in      the fungal wall of Phytophthora parasitica strain 26.

The first symptoms are assessed starting on day 3 and up to      day 7, according to the following scale: </PAR><PA1>  score 0: no symptoms </PA1><PA1>  score 1: presence of small necrotic points without subsequent development </PA1><PA1>  score 3: appearance of a necrosis spreading to the whole cotyledon. </PA1><PAR>  The added scores are expressed as percentages, 100% corresponding to all      the cotyledons assigned a score of 3. Each replicate contains 15      cotyledons. </PAR><PAR>  The capacity of the phospholipid of formula (Ia) to induce a protection in      capsicum with respect to its pathogen could be demonstrated in this      manner. It was, moreover, shown that, while inositol phosphate is      completely incapable of inducing a protection of capsicum, the ceramide      derived from the phospholipid retains a resistance-inducing activity at      high concentrations. </PAR><PAR>  The effect of the concentration of the phospholipid of the invention on the      resistance-inducing activity was also studied. </PAR><PAR>  The phospholipid of formula (Ia) was applied on the capsicum Yolo Wonder at      increasing concentrations. The results illustrated in FIG. 19 show that      the sensitivity of the capsicum cotyledons with respect to Phytophthora      capsici (as ordinates) decreases rapidly with an increase in the      concentration of the solution of phospholipid of formula (Ia) which is      applied to it (as abscissae). A sensitivity of 100% corresponds to a total      absence of resistance; in contrast a sensitivity of 0% corresponds to a      total resistance. The sensitivity of the capsicum to its pathogen      decreases by half after application of 7 .mu.g/ml of phospholipid; the      protective effect is maximal for doses of phospholipid of formula (Ia)      varying from 50 to 250 .mu.g/ml. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 5 </PAC><PAC>  Application Of The Fungal Elicitor Of The Invention On Various Plants </PAC><PAC>  A--Plant Material </PAC><PAR>  Various market-garden plants were used: melon (variety Vedrantais), tomato      (variety Monalbo) and capsicum (variety Yolo Wonder). </PAR><PAR>  The seeds of market-garden plants are sown in pans, the germination and      development of the seedlings up to the 1- to 2-leaf stage taking place      under glass. </PAR><PAC>  B--Procedures For Application Of The Fungal Elicitor andlsqb;Compound of Formula      (Ia)andrsqb; </PAC><PAR>  The elicitor was applied to the plants in the following manner:      instantaneous dipping of the sectioned end of a cotyledon into a solution      of elicitor at a concentration of 100 .mu.g/ml. </PAR><PAC>  C--Artificial Contaminations Designed To Demonstrate The Induced State </PAC><PAR>  To monitor the induced state of the aerial portion, different leaf      parasites were used according to the plants being studied: </PAR><PA1>  melon: Pseudoperonospora cubensis maintained on melon cotyledons kept alive      on water at 18.degree.-20.degree.
