The Labor Department said import prices rose 1.6 percent fromOctober through December after falling 1.3 percent in the thirdquarter. That had been their first decline in more than two years.   The fourth-quarter increase was moderated by a drop in the costof crude oil and other imported fuels, which decreased 7.8 percentafter plunging 9.0 percent in the previous three months.   From October through December, prices for imported crudematerials rose by 5.5 percent, imported machinery costs were up 2.5percent, intermediate manufacturing products gained 2.4 percent andchemical prices increased 2.3 percent.   Removing the big drop in energy prices, all other imported goodsregistered a 2.4 percent increase over the previous quarter.   Last year's increase in import prices and a 10 percent riseduring the previous year were linked to the weakening of the U.S.dollar, which fell in value by 2.6 percent in 1988 and 13.6 percentin the previous year, according to a trade-weighted index used bythe Labor Department.   The fall of the dollar, while improving the price competitivenessof U.S. goods overseas and helping to lower the U.S. trade deficit,also has the effect of boosting the prices of foreign goods boughtin the United States.   The higher import costs affect inflation of consumer pricesoverall, which rose 4.4 percent in 1988 and by a like margin duringthe previous year.   The price of U.S. exports, meanwhile, fell 0.2 percent during thefourth quarter but still stood 6.3 percent higher than a yearearlier.   The biggest decrease in export prices in the fourth quarteroccurred in the food category, which dropped 3.8 percent aftershooting up 14.8 percent in the previous quarter due to the summerdrought.</TEXT></DOC>
