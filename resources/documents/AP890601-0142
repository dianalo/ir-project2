The beast will be virtually extinct within 50 years at thepresent rate of killings, according to the World Conservation Unionand the World Wide Fund For Nature, formerly known as the WorldWildlife Fund.   Charles de Haes, director-general of the fund, urged governmentsto outlaw ivory imports immediately. Otherwise, the slaughter ofelephants increase dramatically as poachers try to sell as muchivory as possible before anticipated agreement on an internationaltrade ban in October, he said.   Japan and Hong Kong account for most ivory imports, de Haes said.   Only 625,000 elephants remain in Africa, half the level of 10years ago, the organizations said.   Poachers have killed most of the big male elephants and areswitching to females and young beasts, the report said. As aresult, three times as many elephants must be killed to provide thesame amount of ivory as 10 years ago.</TEXT></DOC>
