The program would begin Jan. 1.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PANEL TO VOTE ON MEDICAID REGULATIONU.S. MATCHINGFUNDS AT ISSUE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The agreement was expected to be considered at the meeting, but it wasunclear whether Congress would approve the agreement or order a delay in theMedicaid rule before lawmakers adjourn for the year next week.;   &quot;I don'tthink they assumed we could get a deal, and now that we've got one, there's acertain amount of reluctance to move it because of the limited amount of timeleft before adjournment,&quot; said Raymond Scheppach, executive director of thegovernors' association.;   Gail Wilensky, head of the Health Care FinancingAdministration, which handles Medicaid, said &quot;it would be regrettable ifCongress blocked a good-government policy step that benefits all states andprotects essential health care services.&quot;;   The House on Tuesday voted by anoverwhelming margin to prohibit the administration from enforcing theregulation at least until the current fiscal year ends Sept. 30, 1992.;   TheHouse vote followed governors' rejection of an earlier agreement between theassociation and administration officials.;   Scheppach said the latestagreement was endorsed by all but three to five of the 39 states that would beaffected by the Medicaid regulation.;   The rule would prevent states fromusing voluntary donations from Medicaid providers such as hospitals andnursing homes or revenue from special taxes on these providers to get federalmatching funds.;   Federal Medicaid officials argue that once these funds areused to increase a state's federal Medicaid match, the states recycle themoney back to the providers. They estimate that tax and donation programswould cost the federal government $5.5 billion this fiscal year.;   Theagreement would allow states to continue existing tax and donation programsuntil the end of their current fiscal years. States would have three monthsafter that to replace those programs with broad-based taxes on providers. Therevenues from these taxes could account for no more than 25 percent of thestate's total Medicaid costs.;   The agreement also would limit the amount ofextra payments states could make to hospitals that serve large numbers of poorpatients. Currently, some states designate virtually all of their hospitals as&quot;disproportionate share&quot; hospitals so they can qualify for the extra payments.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  WASHINGTON  </CITY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911122  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  14A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  426  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, November 22, 199100327221,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
