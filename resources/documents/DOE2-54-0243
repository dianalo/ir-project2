The method of mathematical theory enables the determinationof the radioprotective complex APAETF + mexamine optimum variant. Theclearly manifested character of the pharmacological effect of ingredients,depending on their dosage proportion, is conditioned by the change ofthe specific role of various mechanisms which provide the radioprotectiveeffect.
