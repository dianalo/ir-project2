History has shown us that the end result of armedconflict continues to haunt a culture long after a war has terminated. Ajourney to the southern United States will still find &quot;confederates&quot; loyal tothe cause. In Germany and in the United States, fascists still holdclandestine meetings. Tears are only moments away from the eyes ofJapanese-Americans wrongfully interned in World War II. The stark, bleakmemorial to the Vietnam War, with thousands of names etched into its stone,expresses pain that is generations away from healing.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SAVE HUMANS FROM TYRANNY: STOP THE WAR  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     A nation cannot simultaneously promote life, liberty and the pursuit ofhappiness at home while delivering death, isolation and misery of unimaginablescale abroad.;    Let's make no mistake about it: War is the most terrible oftyrants. Who lives, who dies or who is crippled is not a democraticallydetermined process but the random result of chaos and chance. Protest, nomatter how quiet or loud, no matter what age the participants, no matter howconservative or outrageous, is now the only way to address and overcome thetyranny of war. It is our humanity that is threatened by this plague and it isour determined humanity which will restore our hope.;    -- Demetrios Nichols;Los Gatos  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910214  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  258  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday February 14, 199100045005,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
