Another speaker warned that TV preaching often fails to strike aresponsive chord among audiences in underdeveloped countries.   During a speech to the conference, Peter Kuzmic, director of theBiblijsko-Teolofski Institut in Osijek, Yugoslavia, said evangelistsmust lead by example and that the integrity of their movement will``enhance the Gospel'' or ``discredit and hinder it.''   ``This is illustrated by the recent scandalous behavior andrelated worldwide negative publicity of prominent American TVevangelists and other evangelical leaders,'' Kuzmic said.   ``These scandals show what the `cheap Gospel' related to dollars_ rather than rooted in Christ _ does and how it links with thesinful human nature,'' Kuzmic said.   The Yugoslav did not mention names, but he appeared to bereferring to scandals involving American evangelists Jimmy Swaggartand Jim Bakker.   American evangelists have used television extensively to buildworldwide followings and multimillion-dollar corporate empires.   But Philemon Choi, secretary-general of Breakthrough Ministriesof Hong Kong, said heavy use of satellite and televisioncommunications, which only the rich can afford, may lead theevangelical movement into ``the trap of insensitivity to culture.''   ``While modern communication technology has its glamor and powerin terms of touching millions at a time, we should not forget thatin two-thirds of the world, many people still consider radio sets aluxury,'' he said.   Choi said the appeal of evangelical Christianity as presented byTV preachers ``evaporates once the television is turned off.''   ``We must remember that the tears of the TV evangelist is nosubstitute for the weeping of the wounded, and the `electronicchurch' is no substitute for the true Christian community life,'' headded.   The Lausanne II conference has brought together about 4,200evangelical Christians from 191 countries to discuss ways to spreadtheir faith around the world.   It was organized by the Lausanne Committee, chaired by the Rev.Leighton Ford, a Canadian who lives in North Carolina. He is abrother-in-law of Billy Graham, the famous American evangelist andpioneer in television preaching.</TEXT></DOC>
