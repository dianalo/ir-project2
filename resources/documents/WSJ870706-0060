The opportunity came Wednesday, when investment banker Geoffrey Collier faced a British judge after pleading guilty to two counts of insider trading. The case of Mr. Collier, a former director of Morgan Grenfell Securities Holdings Ltd. and a highly regarded figure in the international securities markets, was the first of its kind to be prosecuted under the government's tough new insider-trading laws. For that reason alone, many expected Mr. Collier to get especially stern treatment in court.    Instead, he drew a one-year suspended prison sentence and a #25,000 ($40,450) fine. The leniency outraged politicians and astonished the City, London's financial district, where bankers said it will raise questions about the credibility of efforts to crack down on insider trading.    While it is much too early to say whether this will help turn the pendulum away from self-regulation, as some already suggest, it does little to reassure observers that London's new system is more effective in punishing wrongdoing than the old.    &quot;The Collier business leaves a very unsatisfactory image for the government and the City,&quot; said Robin Cook, a Labor Party member of Parliament.    Outside the political arena, the reaction was similar, including that of two leading British newspapers. &quot;Much of the credibility of the City's efforts to improve its behavior rests on the premise that wrongdoers will be firmly dealt with, and that premise has not been strengthened in this case,&quot; said the Financial Times.    The Independent newspaper said, &quot;The chances are much better than even that insider dealers can carry on their dishonest trade with little fear of being found out. All the more reason then, that when wrongdoers are uncovered and found guilty they should be dealt with harshly.&quot;    Within the City itself, bankers declined to speak publicly but privately agreed. &quot;If it is held up as an example,&quot; said a senior official at an American investment bank here, &quot;it puts very little damper on that kind of activity here in the future.&quot; A British merchant banker said the sentence &quot;serves as absolutely no deterrent for other people. A short sharp two years in prison might have done the trick.&quot;    Until last year's deregulation of the securities markets here, policing the City was pretty much up to the same &quot;old-boy&quot; network that ruled it. But with deregulation has come a sweeping effort at reform.    In removing the traditional and legal barriers dividing brokers, bankers and traders, Parliament decreed that &quot;self-regulation&quot; must be backed with tough new penalties for lawbreakers. The government staked much prestige on its responsibility for assuring integrity in the markets.    Strengthening the insider-trading laws was an important part of that. Insider trading didn't become a crime here until 1980; since then, eight cases have been prosecuted, with five convictions. No prison terms have been imposed. Tough new laws boosting prosecutorial powers and penalties were passed in each of the past two years. Convictions, which once carried a maximum two-year prison term, now can bring a seven-year sentence.    Thus, when the Collier affair emerged just two weeks after the Big Bang, the final step in the deregulation, it immediately became a test of the new rules. Mr. Collier, a director at Morgan Grenfell Group PLC's securities unit, had traded stock in two companies, AE PLC and Cadbury Schweppes PLC, which he apparently knew were to be possible targets of bids by Morgan Grenfell clients.    The discovery that one of London's most visible international bankers was engaging in such activity rocked the City and brought renewed assurances from government officials that such offenders would be dealt with harshly. To assist the Collier investigations, the effective date was advanced for some of the new provisions of the insider laws. By last week, when Mr. Collier entered court for sentencing, most expected him to draw a stiff punishment.    In delivering the sentence, even Justice Donald Farquharson seemed a little defensive. He said that Mr. Collier was a first-time offender, and agreed with defense lawyers that Mr. Collier shouldn't be made a scapegoat for all financial misconduct in the City. The judge also clearly distinguished between Mr. Collier's case and insider-trading cases in the U.S. Finally, he warned that Mr. Collier's sentence shouldn't be seen as a precedent, saying that future judges might not &quot;feel able to suspend imprisonment&quot; in insider-trading cases.    But such caveats did little to dissuade criticism. &quot;If it were the long-term bottom line, it would be very harmful,&quot; said Harvey J. Goldschmid, professor of law at Columbia Law School in New York. &quot;One hopes (Britain) will pick up the pace and move down the road&quot; toward stiffer penalties.
