He said the nation has not yet reached the point where the oathtaken by federal judges _ ``to administer justice without regard toperson, and do equal right to the poor and the rich'' _ is areality for all Americans.   ``Our work is not done _ the work of ensuring that recourse tojustice is within the reach of every individual in this nation. Forthe poor especially, the legal process can be a costly, complex andextremely cumbersome route to the justice that they deserve,'' Bushsaid at the White House signing ceremony.   ``Every citizen's claim should be judged on its merits, not onthe basis of his status, or place or standing in society. It's thevery core of the democratic idea,'' Bush said.   Speaking to a small group of people involved in the Justicesystem, including the American Bar Association president, Bushplugged his proposal to increase the pay of federal judges by 25percent, calling that raise long overdue.   ``We must recruit and retain this nation's best legal talent onthe federal bench ... I urge each of you and all of those out therelistening to give your strongest, possible support to see that thatmeasure wins quick approval,'' he said.   In his proclamation, he called on the legal profession, schools,government agencies, the media and other organizations in society``to focus public attention on the importance of making access tojustice a reality for all persons.''</TEXT></DOC>
