(new approaches to data storage)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Vogelgesang, Peter.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Vast increases in demand for storing more and more data on smallermedia have led to the development of higher-density storage, whichuses a smaller magnetic or optical area for each bit ofinformation.andP;  High capacities and data transfer rates tend toresult in slow access times.andP;  Recording simultaneously ondifferent surface areas is one solution to this problem, but islimited by mechanical precision.andP;  An all-electronic systemrecording in three dimensions would simplify recording systems andeliminate the need for mechanical precision.andP;  Major breakthroughsare needed in order to make such a system practical.andP;  Neuralnetworks mimic the storage density of the human brain usingadaptive rather than programmed logic.andP;  Bit size cannot continueto decrease forever, but data rates are likely to increase andaccess times to decrease in the future through the use ofwell-designed transducer arrays.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     High-Density StorageStorage CapacityData ManagementFuture TechnologiesResearch and DevelopmentInformation Explosion.andO;Feature:   illustrationm chart.andO;Caption:   An ideal binary storage device.
