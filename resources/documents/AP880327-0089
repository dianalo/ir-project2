Dissidents described the stoppage in Stepanakert, in a regionthat Armenians want transferred from the control of the republic ofAzerbaijan to the neighboring republic of Armenia, as a generalstrike.   Soviet reports said more than 1,500 civilian auxiliary policehad moved into the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait and that similarforces patrolled the Azerbaijani capital of Baku.   Stepanakert is in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh.Sumgait, the scene of ethnic clashes that left at least 32 dead inlate February, is in the Sumgait District of Azerbaijan.   In Armenia, troops with attack dogs were deployed Saturday inthe capital of Yerevan to crack down on street rallies calling forNagorno-Karabakh's annexation by Armenia, the official press said.   A Moscow dissident, Alexander Ogorodnikov, on Saturday describedYerevan as a ``dead city'' with most people staying inside insilent protest.   Armenians began strikes and street rallies Feb. 13 inStepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh's main city, demanding that theregion be united with Armenia.   Armenians make up more than three-quarters of Nagorno-Karabakh'spopulation, but they say they suffer racial, cultural and economicdiscrimination in Azerbaijan. Most Armenians are Christians, whileAzerbaijanis are mostly Shiite Moslems.   The government newspaper Izvestia said Sunday that authoritiesblocked the central streets of Stepanakert and that militiamen werepatrolling Saturday.   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported Sunday that 1,500civilian auxiliary police had been deployed in Sumgait and in Baku.   ``Only reinforced voluntary public order squads, made up ofworkers with red armbands who assist militia in the streets,indicate that some tension still persists in Baku,'' Pravda said.   The Armenian nationalist protests subsided after Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev appealed Feb. 26 for restraint, promisingsocial and economic improvements.   But on Wednesday, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, thecountry's highest executive body, brushed aside the annexationdemand.   Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh then called for a general strike.It began Wednesday, Moscow dissident Sergei Grigoryants said Sunday.   Izvestia said Sunday in a report from Stepanakert: ``Enterprisesin the city today (Saturday) aren't working, except for essentialservices such as bread and milk factories, transport, watersupply.''   Pravda said: ``There is a relative lull in Nagorno-Karabakh .. .but the majority of enterprises of the regional center,Stepanakert, are idle.''   None of the articles, however, attributed the disruptions to astrike.   Andrei Bavitsky of the dissident journal Glasnost had said inMoscow that 15,000 local policemen were patrolling StepanakertSaturday.   Grigoryants, a former political prisoner who is half ethnicRussian and half Armenian, said the Stepanakert strike wasscheduled to last through Friday.   Bavitsky and Grigoryants said they received their informationfrom telephone contacts in the region. The government has barredforeign correspondents from the area and prevented phone calls tothe region Sunday.   Armenian and Azerbaijani media have warned activists of``unpredictable consequences'' if they carry out demonstrations orstrikes. At least four Armenian activists have been arrested inYerevan.   At least one of those arrested, Paruyr Ayrikyan, was chargedunder a law which Gorbachev's administration has said was underreview, according to dissidents.   Press Club Glasnost, an unsanctioned Moscow group of humanrights activists, said Sunday it learned from Ayrikyan's relativesthat he was charged under a law barring the defamation of theSoviet Union.   ``The very fact of Ayrikyan's arrest and charge represents aserious step backward, a retreat to the times of repression againstevery independent opinion, every free word,'' Press Club Glasnostsaid in an appeal to Gorbachev to free Ayrikyan.   Ayrikyan, 38, headed an underground Armenian nationalist groupcalled the National Unification Party and was jailed for 17 yearsbeginning in 1969 for his political activities. He is chairman of anationalist group called Alliance for National Determination.</TEXT></DOC>
