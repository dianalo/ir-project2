 The 10BaseTstandard spells out the exact ways in which Ethernet data signals can be sentover telephone wire, and stands to make those professionals' daily lives agood deal more pleasant than heretofore possible.andM;Ostensibly, 10BaseT gives them a low-cost cabling alternative--unshieldedtwisted-pari wiring (UTP), better known as telephone wire--for transmittingEthernet data signals.andP;  Millions of miles of telephone wire installed inbuildings worldwide can now be safely used for Ethernet data transmission.andO;The ability to use existing UTP and its resulting savings from not having topull new cable may be a superficial benefit of 10BaseT.andP;  Not all UTP hiddenbehind walls can support Ethernet, so they often need new cables, anyway.andM;10BaseT's real benefits promise to overshadow the economics of not pullingnew cabling.andP;  The true benefits of 10BaseT will be derived through increasedcontrol of Ethernet networks in general and network cabling plantsspecifically.andP;  The 10BaseT standard's most important feature might very wellbe that it gives Ethernet topological parity with IBM's Token Ring scheme,the industry's other popular networking technology.andM;The newly passed 10BaseT standard calls for connecting Ethernet workgroups ina star topology that focuses all networks cabling in a single wiringconcentrator, or hub, as shown in Figure 1.andP;  Token Ring's physical startopology, with its centralized wiring hub, has been one of the major reasonsit has made substantail popularity gains against Ethernet in recent years.andM;At the LAN's CenterandM;Why would Ethernet managers want to concentrate the wiring at the center oftheir networks?andP;  Token Ring's centralized architecture makes its LAN cablingsystems, which are in really electrical rings, easy to manage--and that's adistinct selling point to over-worked network managers.andM;A description of a traditional Ethernet bus-style network explains the whysof centralized neworks: In a standard Ethernet, the network cabling runs fromone node (e.g., computer or printer) to another, in essence meandering fromdesk to desk in a continuous single strand.andP;  This is a simplified busnetwork, which can also contain cable branches running off the main, orbackbone, cable; in such branching cabling systems, however, the problemsdescribed here are virtually identical to those affecting non-branchingbuses.andM;Imagine the headache of trouble-shooting this seemingly never-ending stretchof cable on a bus: When workstations on a bus-based LAN experience may haveto inspect the technician may have to inspect the entire cable segment, whichcan be several kilometers long, before finding the problem.andP;  This can betime-consuming, frustrating, and costly.andM;Troubleshooting a hub-based network entails no such run-arounds: Eachworkstation is attached to the hub directly via its own unshared cable, asFigure 1 shows.andP;  This means the technician troubleshooting a particularnetwork node has to worry about only the cable segment running from the hubto that node, not the entire network wiring system.andP;  This can representsubstantial time savings in diagnosing network failures.andM;A Look at a HubandM;Although each of the network hube on the market are similar to each other,they're also dramatically different, too.andP;  All of the network hubs containtwo basic components--a chassis and topology-specific modules--that allowcreating easily reconfigurable networks.andP;  But each vendor has elected to workwithin its own design philosophy that makes for significant physicaldifferences among those available.andM;A chassis is the hub's most visible component.andP;  It acts as the hub enclosureand serves as the interface between each of the individual modules.andO;Individual vendor's hubs contain varying numbers of accessory slots, each ofwhich accepts a single module.andM;The hubs usually contain an integral power supply and/or primary controllerunit.andP;  Depending on a vendor's design perform network management may performnetwork management functions, serve as a repeater for all modules in thechassis, or act as the connection point to hubs located in other parts of abuilding or office or campus complex.andM;The modules serve as the link between the chassis and the network cabling andare thus cable-specific.andP;  That means they contain connectors that accept onlycertain types of connectors, each of which is associated with a specific typeof cable.andP;  For example, a vendor may support IBM's Type 3 (IBM-certified UTP)Token Ring wiring and its associated connector with one module, thick andthin Ethernet coaxial cable with another, the UTP wire module, and Arcnetcoax or fiberotical thiid module, and Arcnet cox or fiber-optical cable withstill other modules.andM;Each module usually contains connectors for multiple workstations.andP;  Placingtwo, four, or six connectors is common, depending on the intended use andtype of cable to be attached to the module.andP;  For instance, thick coaxconnections require what is called a DIX connector, which is substantiallylarger than the RJ-45 used with UTP.andM;Some vendors offer modules that combine connector types, but only within asingle type of network technology.andP;  For example, most hub manufacturers sellmodules that support connections to both thick  or thin Ethernet coax and10BaseT UTP.andM;Their Physical DifferencesandM;As is often the case in free enterprise, various network-products vendorshave applied their own proprietary sets of design rules to their hubs.andP;  Forinstance, some hubs are six to eight inches high, while others are 12 to 18inches, and the physical and/or electrical junctions that connect the moduleto the chassis generally differ in each vendors' implementations.andM;The reasons for these differences range from the complex, such as needing tocram sufficient functionality onto a product, to the simple, such as merelyensuring that the hub is physically compatible with the vendor's existingproducts.andP;  These design differences mean, of course, that a module designedfor one vendor's wiring concentrators generally will neither fit in noroperate with another vendor's hub.andM;Fortunately, these physical incompatibilities don't carry over to the hubs'abilities to communicate with each other.andP;  Although the modules themselvesmay be physically and/or electrically incompatible, the cable-specific jackson them provide industry-standard connections.andM;For instance, the 10BaseT connectors (known as RJ-45s) on one vendor's hubsare identical to those on another's.andP;  This is also true for the thin andthick coax, fiber-optic.andP;  Token Ring, and Arcnet connectors.andM;Because these connectors are identical, it's possible to connect one vendo'shubs to another's.andP;  In fact, 14 vendors demonstrated this type ofinteroperability between their hubs at this year's interop show in San Jose,Calif., in October.andM;A Wealth of Other BenefitsandM;The wiring hub's modular design allows vendors to integrate a wealth of otherfeatures and cabling options into them.andP;  As already noted, this architecturepermits mixing the different cabling media--that is, fiber-optic, thick andthin cable, and UTP--into one wiring center.andP;  Without such hubs, expensiveinternetwork devices such as bridges and routers are required.andM;Just as importantly, the modular approach also allows mixing differentmedia-access technologies, such as Token Ring and Ethernet or Ethernet andFiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), in a single hub.andP;  This permitsmerging and managing the several different types of network technologies at asingle point.andM;This capability is especially valuable to the growing number of largecorporations where small clusters of Token Rings and Ethernet have sprung upindependently.andP;  Again, it often means an organization does not have topurchase an inernetworking device to connect and manage a variety ofworkgroups.andM;Vendors have also moved hubs out of the local workgroup and into so-calledenterprisewide networks.andP;  Hubs can be daisy chained together--that is,connected one after another--to form large networks made up of multipleworkgroups connected to separate-but-interlinked hubs.andM;On a more conplex level, vendors are developing modules--usually inconjunction with non-hub vendors--that provide internetwork bridging and/orrouting capabilities.andP;  These modules route and/or filter network trafficbetween the modules in hubs, whether the hubs are in a local or remote site.andO;Filtering allows a network manager to improve internetwork performance andsecurity by restricting the flow of specified types of data packets acroossinternetwork borders.andM;Vendors working in this direction are SynOptics Communications (MountainView, Calif.) and cisco Systems (Menlo Park, Calif.).andP;  These companies aredeveloping modules for SynOptics' LattisNet concentrator that utilize cisco'srouter technologies.andP;  In addition, Cabletron Systems (Rochester, N.H.) hasintroduced a modules for its Multi-Media Access Center (MMAC) hub that actsas a protocol-independent bridge between Ethernet and FDDI.andP;  According toCabletron, this module supports 10BaseT UTP, thick and thin coax, and theFiber-Optic Inter-Repeater Link (FOIRL) media.andM;Boon to ManagementandM;Network hubs are ideal for centralizingandM;Network hubs are ideal for centralizing vendors have announced &quot;intelligent&quot;network hubs.andP;  Intelligence in this context refers to the hub's ability toaccept management and configuration commands over the network cabling from aremote workstation.andM;Among the vendors that have released intelligent network hubs are SynOptics,Cabletron, David Systems (Sunnyvale, Calif.), with its intelligentConcentrators, Ungermann-Bass (Santa Clara, Calif.), with its Net-One hub,and Lannet Data Communications' (Huntington Beach, Calif.), with its MultiNetII product.andM;Putting intelligent into a hub allows these devices to perform many functionsthat normally require an onsite technician's presence.andP;  For instance, networkmanagers sitting at a centrally located network management station can notonly turn remote hubs on or off, they can turn off individual modules andeven individual ports within a module.andP;  They can then can reroute trafficfrom the failed module or port to a working one.andM;This ability is vital in large, enterprisewide networks, where a singlemanager may be in charge of a WAN spanning several cites or states.andP;  In suchsituations, it's not always economically feaible to maintain a technicianonsite to troubleshoot occasional problems.andP;  The ability to reconfigure thehub from a remote site can thus mean the difference between keeping a networksegment online or shutting it down until a technicial can make the trip torepair the failed unit.andM;Some vendors are taking hub-based network management even further.andP;  Lannet,for instance, claims to be the first Ethernet manufacturer to providefault-tolerant Ehternet links between its hubs.andP;  This eliminates anotheradvantage--built-in redundancy--that Token Ring had over Ethernet.andO;Developments such as these are spurring the industry's move to hub-basednetworks--and eliciting sighs of relief from network managers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
