Impinger samples contained0.4 to 12.2 million particles per cubic foot (mppcf) and membrane filtersamples contained 0.0 to 31.3 asbestos fibers greater than 5 micronsper cubic centimeter (f/cc). Several samples from the mixing, finishing,packing, and hopper rooms contained asbestos concentrations in excessof the 1967 threshold limit value of 5 mppcf as measured by impingersampling or 12.O f/cc as measured by the membrane filter method.</TEXT></DOC>
