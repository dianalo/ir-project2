The protestors in Milwaukee; Ann Arbor, Mich.; Jackson, Miss.;and Tampa and Melbourne, Fla., were dragged off by police afterblocking the entrances to clinics.   The protests appeared timed to sway the court, which is dueApril 26 to consider a challenge to the landmark Roe v. Wadedecision legalizing abortion. A week ago, more than 300,000abortion rights supporters marched in Washington.   The Tampa Women's Health Center was blocked for about threehours before officers moved in to make arrests, said HillsboroughCounty sheriff's spokesman Jack Espinosa. He said 187 of theestimated 1,000 demonstrations were detained.   Protesters temporarily blocked a section of the street in frontof the clinic near the University of South Florida, Espinosa said,but police had ``no problem'' making the arrests. The detaineeswere transported to a nearby junior high school for booking ontrespassing charges.   Robin Kennedy, administrator at the Aware Woman Clinic inMelbourne, said the clinic entrance was blocked in the morning, butpatients ``were not intimidated by the bullies on our doorstep.''   Police made from 130 to 150 arrests. Ms. Kennedy estimated thecrowd at 250 to 300 people but Operation Rescue, the nationalumbrella group that has been organizing the protests, said about500 people showed up.   About 200 Milwaukee protesters lined up before 8 a.m. at adowntown building that houses the Affiliated Medical Servicesclinic, and kept workers and patients from entering.   Each time small groups of protesters crossed police lines andwere arrested, another group would head for the entrance, where inturn they were handcuffed and taken away. Police said 130demonstrators were cited for trespassing, which carries a $79 fine.   About 60 protesters were arrested in a protest Friday at thesame building.   ``The longer we're here, the longer the clinic stays closed andthe more time the women have to reconsider their decision,'' saidJan Parshall, a protest spokeswoman.   About two dozen abortion rights demonstrators gathered acrossthe street and chanted ``Haul 'em Away'' as police made the arrests.   Richard Withers, a spokesman for Planned Parenthood ofWisconsin, said pro-choice supporters want to make sure that newsstories about abortion protests note there are people on the otherside of the issue.   In Jackson, protesters arrived before 7 a.m. at two women'sclinics and blocked entrances, police said. Fifty-six protesterswere released after being charged with disorderly conduct andtrespassing.   About 75 demonstrators were arrested in an anti-abortionprotests in Ann Arbor, police said.</TEXT></DOC>
