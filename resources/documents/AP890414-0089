Banco Ambrosiano, Italy's largest private bank, collapsed in1982 after it was unable to collect $1.3 billion in loans made to10 dummy companies in Latin America. The loans were issued afterletters of assurance were received from the Vatican bank.   De Benedetti was notified in 1987 he was under investigation forpossible extortion in connection with his sale of Banco Ambrosianoshares shortly before it went bankrupt. Last week, two Milanmagistrates indicted 35 people in connection with theirinvestigation of the scandal. They cleared De Benedetti of anywrongdoing in connection with the bank failure.   De Benedetti's economic empire includes the Olivetti computergroup and Mondadori, one of Italy's giant publishing houses.   Italian news agencies and state television said prosecutor PierLuigi Dell'Osso disagreed with the magistrates' conclusion about DeBenedetti and had asked the Court of Appeals to indict thefinancier for alleged extortion of Roberto Calvi, the BancoAmbrosiano chairman whose body was found hanging from a Londonbridge in 1982. A court ruled in January that Calvi was murdered.   De Benedetti was vice chairman of the bank for 65 days whenCalvi was chairman.   Last week, De Benedetti said he was satisfied because he hadalways ``acted in the full respect of the law.''   Those indicted last week included Licio Gelli, a financier whowas charged with complicity in fraudulent bankruptcy. Gelli hasbeen accused in other investigations of masterminding a ring ofright-wing terrorists.   He was grandmaster of a secret lodge that investigators linkedto a plot to topple the government.</TEXT></DOC>
