DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge declined to hold Minorco SA incontempt of court Thursday, giving the South Africa-linked goldproducer a victory in its tangled takeover battle for ConsolidatedGold Fields PLC.   However, U.S. District Judge Michael B. Mukasey said he mightreconsider his decision if Minorco tries to prevent Gold Fieldsfrom voting its shares in an American mining concern.   Last fall, Minorco, which is largely controlled by two SouthAfrican corporations, Anglo American Corp. of South Africa and DeBeers Consolidated Mines Ltd., launched a hostile takeover bid forGold Fields. Minorco, a Luxembourg corporation, already held almost30 percent of Gold Fields' shares.   British-based Gold Fields and its U.S. subsidiary, NewmontMining Corp., the largest gold producer in the United States, suedin New York to block the takeover by Minorco.   Last October, Mukasey issued an injunction barring Minorco fromacquiring more Gold Fields shares on antitrust grounds. He notedthat the combined entities would control nearly a third of thenon-communist world's gold market.   Minorco now owns or has tenders for about 55 percent of GoldFields' shares, but Mukasey's injunction bars Minorco from buyingthose shares it doesn't own.   Gold Fields owns 49.3 percent of Newmont.   On Tuesday, Britain's Panel on Takeovers and Mergers orderedGold Fields to drop out of the American lawsuit, leaving Newmont asthe only obstacle to the $5.9 billion takeover.   But unless Minorco can get Newmont to withdraw its lawsuit, thebid for Gold Fields will expire next Wednesday under Britishregulations.   Minorco, which previously promised to divest itself of Newmontif allowed to complete the takeover, has been trying to find abidder for the shares of Newmont not owned by Gold Fields.   Newmont expressed concerns at a hearing Wednesday that ifMinorco could get an ally to buy 51 percent of Newmont's stock,Minorco could break the effective control over Newmont that GoldFields now has with its 49 percent stake. Then Minorco couldeffectively force Newmont to drop the lawsuit blocking the takeover.   Newmont asked Mukasey to hold Minorco in contempt, claimingMinorco's maneuvering to try and find a buyer for Newmont violatedMukasey's injunction.   Mukasey, however, declined to find Minorco in contempt for now.   In a two-page order issued early Thursday, Mukasey said he wouldentertain another request to hold Minorco in contempt if it tookany steps that altered Gold Fields' effective control over Newmont.   Mukasey gave Newmont until Monday to reply in writing toMinorco's latest request to dissolve the injunction. Minorco willmake its counter reply on Tuesday and has until Wednesday tocomplete the bid for Gold Fields or let it lapse.</TEXT></DOC>
