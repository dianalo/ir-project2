Lego, chairman and chief executive,said.   Mr. Lego said he &quot;wouldn't take exception&quot; with analysts'estimates that Westinghouse will earn about $3.48 a sharethis year. That would compare with 1989 net of $922 million,or $3.15 a share, adjusted for a 2-for-1 split paid on May 5.Sales in 1989 were $12.84 billion.</LP><TEXT>   For the first six month of 1990, Westinghouse earned $462million, or $1.57 a share, on sales of $6 billion.   &quot;So far, we feel our projections are attainable,&quot; Mr. Legosaid in an interview, despite the fact that the grossnational product growth has been below 2% for the past fivequarters. More than a year ago, Westinghouse officialsforecast that the company would have double-digit per-shareearnings growth this year and 10% operating margins if GNPgrowth was in the 2% to 2.5% range.   Mr. Lego said the electrical-equipment industry, whichalso includes General Electric Co. and Emerson Electric Co.,has &quot;come down faster than the Sandamp;P and Dow Jones averageshave&quot; since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.   He said the slide probably stems from investors' fearsthat such companies will be hurt by capital spending cutbacksduring an uncertain economic period. But the executive saidWestinghouse might benefit in some segments because customers&quot;tend to repair existing equipment during tight economictimes.&quot;   Despite a slowdown in the construction industry, forinstance, Westinghouse's electrical-parts distributionbusiness &quot;is still doing well,&quot; Mr. Lego said.   If anything, the executive said Westinghouse may benefitlonger term as a result of concerns raised by the Iraqsituation. For example, he said, rekindled interest inalternative energy sources could help speed up a revival ofthe company's nuclear power plant business. Westinghousehasn't had a domestic order to build a nuclear plant in morethan a decade. But it has worked on new designs anticipatinga resurgence of nuclear power by the turn of the century.   Mr. Lego, who took over the top job at Westinghouseearlier this summer, also said the military callup promptedby the Iraq situation might force Congress to considerrebuilding the nation's nuclear weapons complex. If so, hesaid, Westinghouse might stand to benefit from designing andbuilding reactors and other facilities to produce nuclearmaterials.   Recently, Westinghouse lost a $1.5 billion contract todesign a reactor for the government. Ebasco Services Inc., asubsidary of Enserch Corp., won the contract. But Mr. Legosaid Westinghouse may be able to participate in that projectbecause the company manages the Savannah River, S.C.,facility where the reactor is slated to be built.Westinghouse also manages other government facilities and isinvolved in cleanup of radioactive and other wastes at thosesites.   Meanwhile, Westinghouse continues to benefit from a surgein orders for power-generation equipment. Mr. Lego said thatmarket is growing at an annual rate of 10% to 15%, and thatWestinghouse's sales are growing at about double that rate.   Most of the orders for turbines and other equipment havecome from independent power producers who will sell power toelectrical utilities. Mr. Lego said the business isperforming better than expected and has an order backlog ofabout $1 billion. &quot;There isn't any indication of a slowdownat all,&quot; he said.   Mr. Lego added that Europe presents &quot;lots of opportunitiesfor us in the service areas.&quot; In particular, he said,Westinghouse is well-positioned to upgrade nuclear powerplants and electric power systems. &quot;In order for thoseeconomies to expand, they have to have electricity,&quot; he said.   In the U.S., Mr. Lego said the most noticeable impact ofthe economic slowdown has been at the company's Group Wbroadcasting unit where television station revenues haveslumped. He said that some regional markets, especially theNortheast, have softened and that auto makers also havepulled back advertising. But some of that TV revenue declinehas been offset by better than expected results at thegroup's radio stations, he said.   Mr. Lego also said that orders for truck refrigerationunits &quot;haven't been as strong as we would have liked them tohave been.&quot; The company's Thermo King over-the-roadrefrigeration business &quot;is still doing well,&quot; he said, but ithas been hurt as customers have been pinched by tight creditand increased fuel costs.   Mr. Lego said the company's financial-services businesshas been hurt by the slump in the real estate market. But hesaid that business &quot;will do better this year than it did lastyear. So far, it's holding its own.&quot;   He said the company's community development business&quot;hasn't slowed at all. We haven't seen any major downturn.&quot;But he expects some scaling back in development of shoppingcenters or strips within such communities.</TEXT></DOC>
