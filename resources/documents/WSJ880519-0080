Mossberg (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> JAPAN </CO><IN> CMD MON </IN><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> PARIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter warned that if Japan tries to stall international deliberations on a U.S. effort to open Japan's beef and citrus markets, the U.S. will file an unfair-trade case in Washington.    In an interview, Mr. Yeutter also disclosed that Japan has suggested that the two countries revive their bilateral talks on beef and citrus imports, which broke off last month when the U.S. filed an unfair-trade complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an international group in Geneva that is adjudicating this trade dispute.    The Japanese, he said, privately have expressed an interest in settling the increasingly bitter dispute before President Reagan and Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita meet June 19 at the seven-nation economic summit in Toronto. Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smith is scheduled to meet today in Tokyo with Japanese officials on the beef issue. But so far, Mr. Yeutter said, there isn't any sign Tokyo is willing to lower barriers to U.S. beef and citrus imports.    Negotiators for the two nations have been wrangling over this issue for months. A U.S.-Japan agreement on beef quotas expired in late March, further accelerating U.S. efforts to gain greater access to Japan's market.    For both nations the dispute has larger political than economic consequences. Reagan administration officials want to take whatever action is necessary to pry open Japan's beef and citrus markets before the November elections, to counter election-year criticism that they aren't tough enough on unfair trade. For their part, Japanese officials insist that yielding to U.S. demands would be tantamount to suicide for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, in power in Japan since 1955. All this gives rise to U.S. suspicions that Japan is stalling and Japanese accusations that the U.S. is playing politics.    &quot;We will not permit them to stall the GATT process,&quot; Mr. Yeutter declared in the interview. &quot;I have told them that if they try, we will self-initiate a section 301 complaint and we will put a definitive timetable on that complaint.&quot; Such a complaint could result in trade sanctions against Japan.    At this point, Mr. Yeutter discussed only a potential unfair-trade complaint, which would be taken under section 301 of U.S. trade laws to counter any Japanese stalling at GATT. But other U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the administration is likely to file a section 301 complaint soon after the Toronto summit unless the beef and citrus issue is settled by then.    In Tokyo, Japanese officials expressed surprise that the U.S. is threatening such a complaint. Japanese officials know that filing a 301 complaint is a difficult last resort for a U.S. president because it requires a consensus among his trade, diplomatic and military advisers. In the past, the State and Defense departments opposed antagonizing Japan unless national security is involved, as it was last year, when the U.S. imposed trade sanctions on Japan for violating a semiconductor agreement.    Mr. Yeutter said the U.S. will be closely watching a June 14 GATT meeting for signs Japan may be dragging its heels. Already, Tokyo has irritated the U.S. by proposing that GATT establish several panels, rather than just one, to deal with the dispute.    In the interview, Mr. Yeutter disclosed that the new bilateral talks were proposed to him and other top U.S. officials during meetings last week by Japan's ambassador to the U.S., Nobuo Matsunaga, who returned to Tokyo soon after.    &quot;The initiative came from them,&quot; Mr. Yeutter said. &quot;Ambassador Matsunaga indicated to me that he planned to strongly encourage the relevant officials of the Japan government to settle this issue bilaterally prior to the economic summit in Toronto.&quot;    In Tokyo, a Japanese government official characterized Tokyo's new proposal as a &quot;brainstorming session&quot; to find common ground. &quot;We have to break the ice,&quot; the official said.    U.S. officials hope Japan may be anxious to settle the issue before the economic summit, both to head off a U.S. unfair-trade filing and increase the chances President Reagan may agree to curb separate sanctions against Japan over semiconductor trade practices, as he did at the 1987 summit in Venice.    Mr. Yeutter said the U.S. is wary about a possible Japanese ploy whereby non-tariff barriers on beef and citrus would be reduced or scrapped, but large tariffs and surcharges would be substituted. &quot;I made it very clear to . . . Ambassador Matsunaga, that a surcharge would not be acceptable to us,&quot; he said.    The U.S. is willing to negotiate some increase in Japanese beef tariffs, currently 25%, if all non-tariff barriers are dropped, because it believes U.S. beef is so much cheaper to produce that it would remain price-competitive in Japan even with high tariffs. But the U.S. would want Japanese pledges that any tariffs would be capped at specified levels, and would diminish over time. And the U.S. opposes surcharges, believing them a bad precedent.    The issue is extremely difficult to settle because influential Japanese politicians, with close ties to agricultural interests, don't want cheap imported beef flooding the market. They, not Japan's trade negotiators, direct policy on this issue.    One such politician is Koichi Kato, chairman of a powerful agricultural subcommittee in Japan's Diet, or parliament. He said yesterday that if Japan is forced to liberalize beef without some &quot;border measures,&quot; such as surcharges or tariffs, the LDP &quot;would be defeated very seriously in the next election. That's why we are sticking so strongly to border measures.&quot;    Mr. Kato said Diet members also fear the U.S. will next attack Japan's ban on imported rice. Although rice is as much as ten times more expensive than elsewhere, most Japanese feel the country must be self-sufficient in rice production as a matter of national security. &quot;If you take on rice liberalization, then anti-American feeling will definitely arise,&quot; Mr. Kato said.    ---   Damon Darlin in Tokyo contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
