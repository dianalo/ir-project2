The House moved with unusual speed to pass the bill, whichalso would give the regulators freedom to change the premiumswhenever they believed it necessary, in the wake of direreports last week that the bank deposit insurance fund couldrequire taxpayer assistance if a recession struck.</LP><TEXT>   The bill is nearly assured of becoming law because it hasthe backing of the Bush administration and strong support inthe Senate, where it is likely to come up shortly. In theface of that consensus, the banking industry isn't lobbyingheavily against it.   Separately, the federal banking agencies settled ayear-long dispute over the minimum level of capital -- thecushion against losses that is drained before depositinsurance funds are called in -- banks must hold. The Officeof the Comptroller of the Currency acceded to a FederalReserve Board proposal to set the minimum at $3 for every$100 of assets for banks that receive the highest ratingsfrom their regulators -- about one bank in five. Other bankswould be required to hold somewhat more capital.   The deposit-insurance measure passed by voice vote underan expedited procedure. It was sponsored by Banking CommitteeChairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) and the committee'sranking Republican, Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio, and hadbroad bipartisan support.   In a clear sign of Congress's election-season sensitivitythat it not be blamed for dawdling if a crisis like thesavings and loan mess strikes the banking industry, the billmoved directly to the House floor without any hearings orBanking Committee action. Under the rules that expedited thebill, a two-thirds vote was required for passage, but thereappeared to be no opposition and there were only a fewcongressmen on the House floor when the measure was cleared.   The legislation would allow the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp. to set the annual premiums for banks and thrifts ashigh as it wishes, removing the cap of 32.5 cents per $100 ofdeposits. Currently the FDIC can raise premiums a maximum of7.5 cents in any one year. Just a few weeks ago, afterexpressing fears that continued bank failures could cause a$2 billion loss to the bank insurance fund this year, theagency increased the premiums to 19.5 cents per $100 for 1991from 12.5 cents in 1990.   If the bill becomes law, the FDIC isn't expected to moveto raise the premiums quickly, but the FDIC's chairman,William Seidman, wants the added flexibility.   Edward Yingling, a top official of the American BankersAssociation, said the trade group wouldn't fight thelegislation but added that &quot;the premiums could quickly reachthe point where additional premiums are counterproductive&quot; bydraining funds from banks. Another trade group, the NationalCouncil of Savings Institutions, noted that &quot;institutions arealready experiencing very severe operating budget problems.&quot;   On capital requirements, the Comptroller pushed for a 3%minimum capital ratio -- $3 for every $100 of assets -- whilethe FDIC wanted a 4.5% level that would accept some lesstangible forms of capital in the extra 1.5%. Under the Fedrule accepted by the comptroller, banks rated the strongestby regulators would have a 3% floor, while others would berequired to hold as much as 5%, determined on an individualbasis. The FDIC is expected to pass the Fed's capital rulesthis afternoon.   Because savings and loan capital requirements by law mustbe as stringent as those for banks, the Fed's position willaffect some thrifts. A spokesman for the Office of ThriftSupervision said it expected that 730 of the nation's 2,450thrifts won't meet the capital requirements when they go intoeffect at the end of the year.</TEXT></DOC>
