Gorbachev and his first visit to anation he once branded an ``evil empire.''   The five-day visit will mark the first trip to Moscow by anAmerican president since Richard Nixon's 1974 summer meeting withLeonid Brezhnev. Later that same year, in November, Gerald Ford metwith Brezhnev in the Soviet port city of Vladivostok.   The summit's intended centerpiece is the signing of a treaty toscrap 30 percent to 50 percent of the superpowers' long-rangebombers, missiles and submarines. However, Reagan already hassuggested an agreement will not be ready, saying time is toolimited.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign MinisterEduard A. Shevardnadze reported Wednesday night that differencesremained between the two sides on the accord.   At separate news conferences they also disclosed sharpdisagreements on explosive regional issues: Afghanistan, the MiddleEast and Central America.   Shultz told reporters at the State Department that he ruled outany agreement to end the war in Afghanistan unless the Soviet Unionsuspends military aid to the Marxist government. The United Stateswill continue aiding Afghan rebels.   He said Shevardnadze rejected a U.S. proposal for a moratoriumon new weapons shipments to Kabul during the Soviet withdrawal andfor three months afterward. The United States would suspend itssupport for the Afghan rebels during the same period.   ``I have ruled out this,'' Shevardnadze told a news conference.   He said the aid was a Soviet treaty obligation ``and we're notgoing to rescind that treaty.'' As Shevardnadze spoke, the chantsof critics of Soviet policies in Armenia, demonstrating outside theSoviet Embassy, could be heard in the room.   Shultz said the Soviets wanted military aid to an unspecifiednumber of Central American governments halted as a condition forthem to stop supplying Nicaragua in its war with the Contra rebels.   As for bringing peace to the Middle East, ``the Soviet conceptis sharply different from ours,'' Shultz said.   The two said in a joint statement they would meet again inMoscow on April 21-25 and also in May, but did not indicate wherethat session would be held.   ``Both sides have worked hard and some progress has beenrealized in a number of areas, but much more needs to be done,''the statement said.   Asked Wednesday if a treaty would be completed, Reagan said, ``Ihave no way of answering that'' and added that the two nations werecommitted to the cutback.   Shevardnadze, asked if a treaty would be ready, said through atranslator: ``It is possible. This is not an easy task. This is avery complicated task, but we are becoming convinced that it isdoable.   ``There are many difficult questions of a technical nature,mostly in verification, but in principle this can be done,'' theforeign minister said as he left the White House following twohours of talks and lunch with Reagan.   The summit announcement capped three days of meetings betweenShevardnadze and Shultz. After a morning round of talks at theState Department, Shevardnadze went to the White House.   Within minutes of his arrival, Shevardnadze and Reagan steppedfrom the Oval Office to the sun-splashed Rose Garden to disclosethe long-awaited summit dates.   ``We have set the date and now we shall take care of goodsubstance, good content for the summit,'' Shevardnadze said.   The Soviet foreign minister returned to the State Department inmid-afternoon and met with Shultz past the dinner hour. Theyreceived reports from separate groups of U.S. and Soviet expertsworking on arms control, human rights and regional issues includingAfghanistan, Central America, the Middle East and the Iran-Iraq war.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president wouldspend all of his time in the Soviet capital, following the patternset by Gorbachev when he remained in Washington during his Decembersummit with Reagan. However, first lady Nancy Reagan is planning aday trip to Leningrad.   White House planners are exploring the possibility of setting upmeetings with Soviet dissidents and refuseniks, as well asarranging a presidential trip to a performance by the Bolshoiballet.   Asked what the summit would achieve if an arms agreement is notsealed, Reagan said, ``There are a number of other subjects that wecontinue to discuss with each other.''   In recent weeks, a number of dates were rumored for the summit,all of them in the week before May 29.   Fitzwater said the timing was not finally settled untilmid-morning Wednesday. ``We had a set of dates at the end of May;they had a set of dates at the beginning of June. These are thecompromise dates we came up with,'' he said.   At the White House talks, Shevardnadze devoted most of hispresentation to the strategic arms talks. Reagan's Star Warsmissile defense system, which has been an obstacle to an armsagreement, did not come up, Fitzwater said.   Reagan will leave Washington on May 26 or May 27, stopping twoor three nights in Helsinki, Finland, the spokesman said. That isintended to let him adjust to the eight-hour time differencebetween Washington and Moscow and to make a scene-setting speechfor the talks with Gorbachev.   Before returning to Washington, Reagan will stop in London tobrief allies and make another speech summing up the trip. Fitzwatersaid a news conference also is planned after the summit, but thatthe location has not been determined.   The actual summit in Moscow probably will be confined to threedays, the same as the December meeting in Washington, Fitzwatersaid. The five-day schedule includes arrival and departure dates,he added.   Reagan, who built his political career as an ardentanti-communist, came into office in 1981 saying Kremlin leaders didnot hesitate to lie or cheat to achieve their goals. Toughening hisline, he later called the Soviet Union ``an evil empire.''   However, he softened his tone in his second term, and worked outa treaty _ signed in December _ to abolish U.S. and Sovietmedium-range nuclear missiles.   Reagan has said Gorbachev is different from other Sovietleaders, with his campaign for openness and reform. After theDecember summit, he said he felt the Soviets no longer were intenton world domination and that the two superpowers can live in peace.</TEXT></DOC>
