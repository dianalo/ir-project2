At the end of 1988, foreigners held an estimated $634 billion inU.S. debt, or about 5.6 percent of the $11.3 trillion inoutstanding credit market debt. Last year alone, foreigners pumpedabout $106 billion into the U.S. credit market, according toFederal Reserve statistics.   So when the bond market rallied recently on the newfoundstrength of the U.S. dollar overseas, foreign investment was amajor reason. A host of negative economic and political news inWest Germany, Japan and Britain also played a role.   The reason? When things aren't going well abroad and U.S.economic signs are being viewed in a positive light,dollar-denominated securities become a good investment forforeigners.   ``They've turned on the buy signal,'' said Robert Brusca, chiefeconomist for Nikko Securities International Inc. in New York.   ``There has been buying of both stocks and bonds,'' he said.``(Foreigners) have to buy dollars to do that, and they've beendoing that.''   When the dollar soared last week to a 29-month high against theWest German mark and a 19-month high against the Japanese yen,foreign investors scrambled to buy U.S. bonds.   The stock bribery scandal in Japan that has led to PrimeMinister Noboru Takeshita's resignation and domestic politicalpressures on West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl also have weakenedconfidence in those countries.   And with central banks in West Germany and Japan ponderingwhether to raise interest rates in an attempt to stave off therising dollar but still taking no action, U.S. bonds remainedattractive.   The Bank of England boosted its base lending rate a full pointto 14 percent in the middle of last week, fueling speculation thatJapan and West Germany would follow suit, and bond prices backedoff a bit. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall.   ``The stronger dollar is a confidence builder for the foreigninvestor, but if the dollar rises at too rapid a rate it raisesdoubts about durability,'' said John Lonski, senior economist atMoody's Investors Service.   A shaky economic climate in West Germany and Japan could spur atightening of monetary policy.   In West Germany, the outlook on inflation has been bleak withhigh oil prices and a weak mark. In Japan, import prices haveincreased rapidly and the yen has sunk, but government officialsthere have said no change in monetary policy is yet warranted.   The initial impact of an interest rate hike by the Bundesbank orBank of Japan would reduce the need of the Fed to ease monetarypolicy and bring down the value of the dollar, which could reducethe foreign binge on U.S. bonds.   The Fed raised interest rates this spring to curb inflation andeconomic growth. But with most U.S. economic indicators pointing toa slowdown, another increase has been viewed as unlikely for now.   ``Foreign bondholders will find that because of policy changesin the United States directed at curbing domestic consumption andincreasing exports, the dollar will be worth more in terms offoreign securities,'' Lonski said.   Because of huge U.S. trade deficits, foreign holdings of U.S.debt have increased at average annual rate of 18.9 percent sincethe early-1980s, Lonski said.   As long as the United States imports more than it exports,foreigners can be expected to continue to loan billions to thecountry in the form of debt securities.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv Monday, May 29</NOTE></DOC>
