Dr. James E. Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute forSpace Studies, told the panel that OMB forced him to contradict hisfindings that the so-called greenhouse effect will increase thelikelihood of drought.   The White House confirmed changes were made, and it defended theaction.   Hansen said that as a government scientist, he ``should be ableto say what my opinions are,'' but added he was unable to convinceOMB offiicals.   ``They're scared of the truth,'' said Sen. Albert Gore Jr.,D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate science subcommittee. ``It's a formof scientific fraud by them.''   ``If they attempt retribution they will have on their hands thecongressional equivalent of World War III'' Gore told Hansen.   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called thepractice routine, and said the changes were made by an OMB officialwho was ``four of five levels down from the top.'' Still, he saidthe ``administration stands behind it.''   Fitzwater claimed that much disagreement exists amongscientists, within and outside the government, on the globalwarming issue.   Hansen's original testimony gave the appearance that ``there wasunanimity within the government on this matter. We simply wanted topoint out that there wasn't,'' the spokesman said. ``We thought wewere commenting on policy, not scientific evidence.''   Opening the hearing today, Gore said: ``Scientists, like Dr.Hansen, tell us that global temperatures could increase two to fivedegrees centigrade in our lifetimes because of the billions andbillions of tons of carbon dioxide we pump into the air every yearand because emissions of other greenhouses gases ....''   The senator said, ``There are a few environmentalists in thisadministration, such as William Reilly at EPA (the EnvironmentalProtection Agency), who is first rate. But they are outnumbered bythe James Watt clones put in key posts throughout theadministration. The environmentalists are being overruled, andworse, they're sometimes being muzzled.''   As former President Reagan's interior secretary, Watt pursuedpolicies that were vehemently opposed by environmental groups.   Gore said Hansen, ``one of our government's foremostscientists,'' was censored ``not on questions of policy, but on hisscientific opinions concerning detailed, painstaking research.''   The New York Times today quoted Hansen as saying OMB edited thetext of his testimony for today's hearing to soften the conclusionsand make the prospects of change in climate appear more uncertain.   ``It distresses me that they put words in my mouth; they evenput it in the first person,'' Hansen told the Times, adding that hehad tried to ``negotiate'' with the budget office over the wordingbut ``they refused to change.''   ``I should be allowed to say what is my scientific position;there is no rationale by which OMB should be censoring scientificopinion,'' Hansen said. ``I can understand changing policy, but notscience.''   The Times said Hansen's original testimony was that computerprojections of changes in climate caused by carbon dioxide andother gases released into the atmosphere show substantial increasesin temperature, drought, severe storms and other stresses likely toaffect the Earth's biological systems.   Hansen's original testimony would have supported the positionthat, while there are still many uncertainties, enough is known nowabout the general and even regional effects of the global warmingtrend to start acting now to mitigate and prepare for thoseeffects, the paper said.   Officials ordered the scientist to change his testimony becauseit would ``conflict with the ideologically based do-nothingapproach which they're most comfortable with,'' said Gore.   Gore said he was told by sources in the Bush administration thatofficials had ``censored the scientific opinions we have asked tobe presented.''   ``I think they're scared of the truth. I think they're scaredthat Hansen and the other scientists are right and that somedramatic policy changes are going to be needed and they don't wantto face up to it because they prefer to do nothing.''   Gore said he knew of no similar orders being given to otherscientists scheduled to testify. He said his committee would askOMB officials to explain why the testimony was changed.</TEXT></DOC>
