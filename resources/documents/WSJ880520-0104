The project is the latest bid by Canadian gas interests to develop new markets for western Canadian natural gas in the Northeast U.S. The National Energy Board said Wednesday it approved construction of Canadian facilities for the supply of Alberta natural gas to a power plant in Rhode Island. Canada already supplies substantial amounts of natural gas to western states.    Canadian Hunter, acting as agent for its parent, Noranda Inc., asked the National Energy Board for a 20-year license to supply as much as 120 billion cubic feet of natural gas to Gas Alternative Systems Inc., New York, for the Syracuse project. Deliveries are to start after July 1990.    The Syracuse plant, with a capacity of 80,000 kilowatts of electricity, is to deliver power to Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., a New York state power utility. Steam heat from the plant will be sold to various Syracuse area institutions including Syracuse University, Crouse Memorial Hospital, Upstate Medical Center, Veterans Administration Hospital and State College of Forestry. The plant is expected to consume about 22 million cubic feet of natural gas a day. The gas is to come from the Alberta fields of Noranda, a Toronto-based energy, mining and industrial concern.    Noranda is to receive a single up-front payment of $70 million (U.S.) for the natural gas. The buyer also will pay all production, royalty and transportation costs. The gas will be transported from Niagara Falls on the Canadian border to Syracuse by Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., a unit of Tenneco Inc., Houston, Texas.    Adam Victor, president and owner of Gas Alternative Systems, said the lump-sum payment approach facilitated the project's financing by removing the uncertainty of the natural gas costs. He predicted the same natural gas supply arrangement would be used by other Northeastern cogeneration plants in the future.    No hearing date has been set for the Canadian Hunter application, which is expected to be approved.    J.G. Schissel, Canadian Hunter's marketing director, said the firm is discussing similar supply contracts with two other planned cogeneration projects in the U.S. whose locations he wouldn't disclose.    Federal Energy Minister Marcel Masse predicted that Canadian exports of natural gas to the U.S. could exceed 1 trillion cubic feet this year. Last year the U.S. purchased 988 billion cubic feet of Canadian natural gas, a 33% increase from 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
