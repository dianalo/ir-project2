And yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, heendorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the ayatollahin exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the mostmistaken foreign policy decisions we've ever made in this country,and I dare say, encouraged others to take hostages, as we now know.   So, there can be no concessions under any circumstances, becauseif we do, it's an open invitation to others to do that same.   We've got to be tough on international terrorism. We've got totreat it as international crime. We've got to attack it at allpoints.   We've got to use undercover operations. We have to be preparedto use military force against terrorist base camps. We have to workclosely with our allies to make sure that they're working with usand we with them.   And we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back ofinternational terrorism.   Yes, we should make every effort to try help those hostages comehome, but it can never be because we make concessions. That was atragic mistake that we made _ mistake that Mr. Bush made, andothers made, and it should never, ever be made again.   Q. Mr. Vice President?   Bush: I wrote the anti-terrorist report for this government. Itis the best anti-terrorist report written.   Yes, we shouldn't trade arms for hostages, but we made vastimprovements in our anti-terrorism.   Now, it's fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base campsbut, when the president saw the state-sponsored fingerprints ofMoammar Gadhafi on the loss of American life, he hit Libya.   And my opponent was unwilling to support that action. And sincethat action _   Dukakis: That's not true. That's not true.   Bush: _ terrorist action against United States citizens havegone down.   And I have long ago said I supported the president on this othermatter. And I've said mistakes were made _ clearly, nobody's goingto think the president started out thinking he was going to tradearms for hostages.   That is a very serious charge against the president. And thathas been thoroughly looked into. But, the point is, sometimes theaction has to be taken by the federal government.   And, when we took action, it had a favorable response.   Lehrer: A question for the vice president, Peter.   Jennings: It seems, perhaps, a good subject, Mr. Vice President,on which to make the point that you've campaigned vigorously aspart of a leadership team. But, so far, you won't tell the Americanpeople in considerable measure what advice you gave the presidenton issues, including the sale of arms to Iran.   And what should have been done about the hostages. To the bestof my knowledge, there's no constitutional requirement whichprevents you from doing so.   Jimmy Carter urged his vice president, Walter Mondale, to tellthe American people. Would you now ask President Reagan forpermission to tell the American people what advice you did givehim? And, if you don't, how do we judge your judgment in the OvalOffice in the last eight years?   Bush: You judge by the whole record. You judge by the entirerecord. Are we closer to peace? Are we doing better inanti-terrorism? Should we have listened to my opponent who wantedto send the U.N. into the Persian Gulf? Or, in spite of themistakes of the past, are we doing better there?   How is our credibility with the GCC countries on the westernside of the gulf? Is Iran talking to Iraq about peace?   You judge on the record. Are the Soviets coming out ofAfghanistan? How does it look in a program he called phony, or someone of these marvelous Boston adjectives up there, about Angola?   Now, we have a chance, now _ several Bostonians don't like itbut the rest of the country will understand _ now, we have achance. Now, we have a chance. Now, we have a chance. And, so, Ithink that I'd leave it right there and say that you judge on thewhole record.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
