MooreStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/09/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP </IN><DATELINE> BRUSSELS, Belgium  </DATELINE><TEXT>   After a decade of pessimism, a new confidence is spreading through West European industry.    Giant conglomerates are scaling down into leaner and more specialized companies. Small, prevously local, enterprises are joining forces across national borders. If diversification was the wave of the 1970s, restructuring -- that often painful process of streamlining, merging and reorganizing -- is the guiding force of the 1980s for European industry.    And suddenly, it seems, restructuring is working, giving Europe hope that it can meet the competitive challenge from the U.S. and Japan in the emerging global marketplace.    &quot;We feel nowadays a totally different confidence in ourselves,&quot; says Klaus Pohle, director of Schering AG, the Berlin-based chemicals and pharmaceuticals concern, which, partly through its own restructuring program, now sells more pharmaceuticals in Japan than at home. &quot;The morale has changed,&quot; he adds.    The new shape of European business and the upbeat assessment of its prospects emerges from a survey of more than 100 chief executives from some of Europe's largest industrial and financial concerns, conducted by The Wall Street Journal/Europe and the management consulting firm Booz-Allen andamp; Hamilton Inc.    Though restructuring may sound like just another buzzword, the survey shows that it has become a basic technique for a wide sector of Europe's industry, from dying steel mills to the most innovative new technologies. A vast majority of respondents -- 86% -- say their companies have undertaken major restructuring in the past three years, and the process is still unfinished for 76% of them. Almost two-thirds plan significant restructuring during the next three years.    &quot;From our standpoint, restructuring is an investment,&quot; says John Marcum, director of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which loosely coordinates economic policy among the world's most-developed countries. &quot;It is an investment that is very likely to have a payoff in future economic growth.&quot;    The prevalence of restructuring in Europe may seem surprising. Unions, political interference and government red tape have long been thought of as nearly insurmountable barriers to sweeping reorganizations and changes of direction. But respondents to the survey indicate that many of the supposed barriers are little more than myths.    &quot;The implementation is arduous, painful and difficult,&quot; says the chief executive of a British metals, chemicals and manufacturing concern, &quot;but all obstacles are surmountable.&quot;    Indeed, highly publicized strikes and labor protests -- like those that accompanied publisher Rupert Murdoch's move from London's Fleet Street to a modern printing operation at Wapping -- no longer seem to be the norm for much of Europe. Union difficulties were cited as obstacles to restructuring by only 18% of the respondents, while senior executives within the company were blamed by 25% as posing a barrier to change.    The examples of restructuring range from the dramatic to the mundane. The big, highly publicized international mergers -- like the creation this year in Europe of the world's second-largest telecommunications firm, Alcatel N.V. -- can shake the foundations of an industry.    But in general, recognition appears to be spreading among European firms of the need to look beyond traditional markets and concentrate on global, rather than local, growth. N.V. Philips, the Dutch electronics giant, says it is determined to start selling electronics products in Japan, the home market of its toughest competitor. And AB Electrolux, the Swedish appliance maker, has made more than 200 acquisitions in the past 15 years, forcing the rest of the home appliance industry into a world-wide competition.    Nearly all the survey respondents, 98%, say they believe restructuring will continue for the foreseeable future. Not only does the process help successful companies stay that way, it can be the only salvation for a company in trouble.    Royal Boskalis Westminster N.V. of the Netherlands, for example, was technically bankrupt three years ago. A program of diversification in the 1970s led the world's largest dredging company further and further from its core business.    &quot;In the 1970s the cost of credit was so low that it paid to borrow money,&quot; says Robert van Gelder, a member of Boskalis's board of management. &quot;Inflation and taxes would eat up a big part of the cost of servicing debt.&quot;    But in the 1980s, Mr. van Gelder says Boskalis is &quot;coming back to reality.&quot; That has meant selling off two-thirds of its businesses (mainly the pipe-laying and civil engineering firms acquired in the 1970s) and &quot;concentrating on the business we know best.&quot; That process has brought Boskalis back from the brink.    Most programs are less dramatic, however. For large multinationals, restructuring can mean whittling away at a business and simultaneously rebuilding it. The turnaround by Italy's Fiat S.p.A. after prevailing in bitter struggles with unions underlines the kind of success that encourages other firms to persist in their efforts. Such successes can also put pressure on unions to ride with the tide.    &quot;Until three or four years ago, making changes in Italy was impossible,&quot; says Anders Scharp, chief executive of Electrolux. &quot;Now unions and political authorities all over Europe understand the need for change and the global aspect of business, even if many don't like it.&quot;    Mr. Scharp became an expert on the Italian situation when his company stepped in to &quot;rescue&quot; Italy's Industrie Zanussi S.p.A. Though the unions at first posed a formidable barrier, after courting by industry and political leaders they grudgingly accepted the elimination of 4,000 of the 20,000 jobs at Zanussi.    In turn, the revival of the company exceeded even the most optimistic forecasts. &quot;Zanussi is so well-tuned now that we are talking about the future: new product lines, investments, even acquisitions by them,&quot; Mr. Scharp says.    Though executives say more restructurings have succeeded than failed, the process requires considerable management acumen. A United Kingdom executive recalls an incident in which dismissal of a subordinate by a senior managing director triggered a dispute among the company directors. &quot;A major confrontation followed, nearly resulting in the senior director (responsible for the disputed dismissal) resigning,&quot; he says. &quot;Restructuring is always painful.&quot;    The industry that reported the highest rate of restructuring is metals, in which 94% of the respondents cited recent examples. That is followed closely by engineering and other manufacturing concerns, where the rate was 89%. Financial service concerns lagged other industries. Only 69% of insurance and bank CEOs surveyed said they had restructured in the past three years -- and 54% said they planned to do so in the coming three-year period.    More than 80% of executives queried say their companies have had opportunities for acquisitions or mergers, and 69% had considered such a move. Availability of capital for takeovers, one of the major problems faced by U.S. companies, was a limiting factor for only 43% of the European respondents.    In some ways, Europe's concentration on global markets probably reflects frustrations with lingering trade barriers at home. &quot;The problems (in creating a common market in Europe) are still very real and very serious,&quot; says Mr. Marcum, the OECD director. &quot;The restructuring shows that the private sector is doing what it can.&quot;    ---             Major Barriers to Restructuring Personnel problems ........................ 44% Change in strategic direction ............. 42%.
