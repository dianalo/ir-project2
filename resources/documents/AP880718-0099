LIM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Angry protesters hurling eggsdisrupted the trial Monday of former President Chun Doo-hwan'syounger brother, who is charged with embezzling millions of dollars.   About 50 radical students and dissidents yelling ``ExecuteChun!'' hurled eggs, potatoes and other objects outside thecourthouse on the first day of hearings in the corruption trial ofChun Kyung-hwan.   Judges suspended the trial until Aug. 8 as disturbancescontinued inside the crowded courtroom. Hundreds of police stoodguard outside, but there were no clashes.   The protesters also accused President Roh Tae-woo of protectingChun's family and called for the immediate arrest of the formerpresident for corruption.   Prosecutors had been questioning the younger Chun, 46, aboutallegations he amassed a fortune as head of the semi-officialSaemaul Undong (New Community) development group, which operatedunder his brother's government.   Chun was arrested March 31 and accused of peddling influence andembezzling about $10 million by diverting the company's funds intoprivate investments.   If convicted, Chun could face a prison sentence or the maximumdeath penalty.   Also on trial were 12 other people, including Saemaul officialsand the younger Chun's two brothers-in-law, who were indicted onembezzlement, bribery and other charges.   Chun and most of the other defendants denied they embezzled themoney, claiming the money was spent for Saemaul developmentprojects.   But some of Chun's aides acknowledged the government charges andsaid Chun sanctioned embezzlement and tax evasion.   When asked about allegations that embezzled money was sentabroad, Chun said he purchased only a $198,000 house in New Jerseywith money borrowed from a U.S. bank and his friends.   Former president Chun's family has been the target of publiccriticism for alleged corruption since he left office in Februaryafter a seven-year term. The opposition has demanded parliamentaryquestioning about wrongdoings in his government.   On Monday, three opposition party leaders, including KimDae-jung, issued a joint statement charging President Roh Tae-woowith trying to protect the former president.   ``We demand president Roh take a clear attitude as liquidator ofwrongdoings under the former administration,'' the statement said.   The opposition has unsuccessfully sponsored two bills aimed atforcing the former president to testify in the National Assembly oncorruption charges.</TEXT></DOC>
