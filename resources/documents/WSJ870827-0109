The company, a unit of General Motors Corp. had said Tuesday that it would shut its plant in Ste.-Therese within 48 hours and lay off 3,500 hourly employees if Canada's rail strike didn't end shortly.    A GM Canada spokeswoman said the plant, which produces Chevrolet Celebrity cars, managed to find an additional 131 trucks daily to deliver parts that usually arrive by rail.    More than 47,000 rail workers struck government-owned Canadian National Railways and CP Rail, a unit of Montreal-based Canadian Pacific Ltd., on Monday. Negotiations to end the strike continue in Ottawa.    On Tuesday, Canada's labor minister, Pierre Cadieux, served notice that the government intends to introduce back-to-work legislation in Canada's Parliament as early as today. </TEXT></DOC>
