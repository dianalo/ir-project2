Due consideration has been given to the twocomments received.One commenter supported the proposed rule.The other commenter supported the proposed rule, but suggested that theinspections required for the Model A300, A310, and A300-600 series airplanesshould be addressed in one AD action, since the parallel French AirworthinessDirective encompassed all three airplanes in one document. The FAA doesnot concur. Since each required inspection and modification are describedin separate service bulletins for each airplane, the FAA has determinedthat addressing the requirements for each airplane model in separate rulemakingactions will pose less confusion to affected operators.Since service bulletins are always subject to change, the commenter suggestedthat, whenever the latest issue of the service bulletin is cited in thefinal rule, the words ``or later approved revision'' should be added. TheFAA does not concur. Since service bulletins issued by foreign manufacturersand revisions thereto are not subject to approval by the FAA, use of sucha phrase would be inappropriate. Furthermore, reference in AD's to futureservice bulletins is contrary to FAA policy. However, later revisions ofthe service bulletin may be used if they are approved as an alternate meansof compliance, as provided by paragraph C. of the final rule.This commenter also noted that all the service bulletins cited in the Noticehave been revised, and the final rule should cite the latest revision tothe service bulletins. The FAA concurs. Since the issuance of the Notice,Airbus Industrie has issued Service Bulletin A300-53-6024, Revision 1,dated July 8, 1988, and Service Bulletin A300-53-6019, Revision 3, datedOctober 13, 1988, which clarify and update the procedures for the inspectionsand the modifications. Paragraphs A. and B. of the final rule have beenrevised to reflect the latest revision to these service bulletins. TheFAA has determined that these changes will not increase the economic burdenon any operator, nor will they increase the scope of the AD.The commenter also suggested that a separate paragraph be added to thefinal rule to require operators to contact the manufacturer for repairinstructions if cracks exceeding 0.8 inch are found. The FAA does not concur,since to do so would be delegating FAA rulemaking authority to the manufacturer.Moreover, the FAA has determined that all cracks equal to or greater than0.8 inch must be repaired prior to further flight, as was proposed in theNotice.After careful review of the available data, including the comments notedabove, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest requirethe adoption of the rule with the change noted above.It is estimated that 3 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by thisAD, that it will take approximately 9 manhours per airplane to accomplishthe required actions, and that the average labor cost will be $40 per manhour.Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD to U.S. operatorsis estimated to be $1,080.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, the FAA has determined that this regulationis not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291 or significantunder DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,1979) and it is further certified under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act that this rule will not have a significant economic impact,positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities becauseof the minimal cost of compliance per airplane ($360). A final evaluationhas been prepared for this regulation and has been placed in the docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Aviation safety, Aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends andSection;39.13 of Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
