Eventually, however, he grew disillusioned with the CND, when it refused to acknowledge the need to find some deterrent to the Warsaw Pact nations' superiority in conventional warfare.    It was then that Mr. Freedman discovered why some people would, as it's said, die for a cause but not stir for a conclusion. Or, as Mr. Freedman writes in &quot;The Price of Peace: Living With the Nuclear Dilemma&quot; (New Republic/Henry Holt, 288 pages, $18.95): &quot;One cannot expect to get people to march behind banners proclaiming 'yes, but' and 'no, however' and 'it's all very difficult.'&quot;    In the ruminative tranquillity of his study, Mr. Freedman does nevertheless try to be discriminating. Indeed, the great value of &quot;The Price of Peace&quot; is that it elegantly peels away the layers of strategic and scientific technicalities encasing the nuclear debate to reveal its political core.    He begins with himself, using his own transformation from activist to strategist to illustrate how political passions rule our appreciation of &quot;objective&quot; data. He then goes on to show how nations manipulate the fear of nuclear war to enhance the power of their own nuclear arsenals. The American policy of &quot;extended deterrence,&quot; which pledges the first use of nuclear weapons in Europe in order to deter a conventional Soviet attack, is such a manipulation.    Yet, as Mr. Freedman notes, people have always been skeptical about whether the U.S. would live up to its policy. Eisenhower's &quot;massive retaliation&quot; strategy was clearly not applicable to many probable situations. Kennedy's slightly more credible &quot;flexible response&quot; still left many observers wondering about the strength of America's nuclear commitment to Europe. By the late '60s, the fundamental question remained whether America's detailed plan for calibrated movement up the escalation ladder meant that Washington would risk sacrificing New York or Chicago for the sake of Bonn or London.    The U.S. responded to such doubts by putting a different face on deterrence. Rather than predicting what a rational opponent would coldly calculate, planners examined how politically sensitive leaders would make decisions in an environment of great uncertainty and confusion. Thus America's policy of extended deterrence could safely rest upon the Kremlin's never being sure that it would not face an escalating conflict.    In Mr. Freedman's view, we had concocted a working myth of flexible response. And not only did it deter the Soviets, but it also kept the NATO alliance together. As we drifted through the heady period of &quot;detente,&quot; few in the alliance were inclined to chip away at the myth; after all, the soothing political climate mellowed most fears that a situation would ever call the policy to account.    But the hard-line trend in American foreign policy during the Reagan administration, Mr. Freedman argues, is bringing down the myth. He reads current European anxiety over the cruise and Pershing II missiles in this light, as a fear that these weapons might one day be used because a faraway limited war had spilled over into Europe. &quot;Such a war might be started,&quot; he writes, &quot;by the Americans for reasons that have much to do with the U.S. global struggle with the Soviets and very little to do with European interests.&quot;    In this analysis, Mr. Freedman pays too little attention to the taproot of European trepidation -- the Soviets' stockpile of accurate missiles and their air-defense system, which is now the world's largest. By building up this fearsome strength, in clear violation of SALT II and the ABM Treaty, the Soviets have seriously undermined NATO's confidence in mutual deterrence.    Surprisingly, Mr. Freedman goes on to advise the U.S. to respect the point of view of Europeans who virtually ignore these facts and who blame the U.S. for all their woes. This is odd, for Mr. Freedman himself notes that there's a '60s generation of European leaders with an &quot;in-built suspicion of American foreign policy.&quot;    And, as Mr. Freedman points out in his discussion of the Strategic Defense Initiative, indulging such people can never make sense. One of the great drawbacks of SDI, he writes, is that it detracts attention from NATO's real concerns. But many of the most vociferous arguments against it are conspicuously reminiscent of the CND's political intransigence, which Mr. Freedman once knew not to take too seriously. So one wonders why he now wants such recalcitrance to dictate nuclear strategy.    Although Mr. Freedman has powerfully countered those arguments that depend on numerical data to establish and maintain confidence in nuclear deterrence, he has not fully sorted out the politics of the matter.    ---   Mr. Goldman is a free-lance writer with a special interest in nuclear policy. </TEXT></DOC>
