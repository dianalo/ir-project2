(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Mario Cuomo told a college audienceMonday that New York state must show leadership in this ``hour offright'' and then vetoed the latest legislation that would restorethe death penalty.   Before issuing his seventh consecutive veto, Cuomo defended hisopposition to the death penalty before a rally of about 400 peopleat Albany's Roman Catholic College of St. Rose. He again urgedlawmakers to approve his alternative of life without parole for somemurderers.   ``The people of New York ought now in this hour of fright to showthe way,'' Cuomo said. ``We should refuse to allow this time to bemarked forever in the pages of history as a time that we were drivenback to one of the vestiges of our primitive condition because wewere not strong enough ... to find a better end to the violence.''   It was the opening salvo of what is expected to be an intenselegislative battle. New York is one of 13 states without an operabledeath penalty law. New York, which introduced the electric chair tothe world in 1890, has not executed anyone since 1963.   With a crack epidemic and its accompanying violence sweepingthrough New York City, supporters of the death penalty in theLegislature claim they'll have enough votes to override Cuomo'sveto. An override attempt is expected in June.   ``I know that this society should strive for something betterthan we are in our worst moments,'' Cuomo said. ``It isn't easy forpeople to hold back their anger ... but that is the only rationalcourse.''   Cuomo said there's no persuasive evidence the death penaltydeters murderers. He said most would be more frightened by thethought of spending the rest of their lives in prison.   Both houses of New York's Legislature have already approved thelatest death penalty bill, for the 13th consecutive year. Cuomo hasvetoed the legislation every year he's been in office, as did formerGov. Hugh Carey in the six years before that.</TEXT></DOC>
