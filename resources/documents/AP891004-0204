ManuelAntonio Noriega held him hostage for up to five hours, but let himgo after loyal forces told his captors they would ``face theconsequences'' if any harm came to the general, a Noriega aide saidWednesday.   Lt. Col. Arnulfo Castrejon, director for the Panamanian DefenseForces Security and Defense Committee, told journalists that duringthe coup attempt on Tuesday, Noriega ``had tried to calm hiscaptors during the time he was held, trying to avoid a bloodshed.''   Lower-ranking officers attempting the coup were defeated afterloyal forces surrounded Defense Forces headquarters andcounterattacked.   ``The surrender came when the loyal officers took command of thecombat units and gave the rebels a last chance to release thecommander and members of his staff or face the consequences,''Castrejon said. ``The general was a hostage for four hours.''   Later Castrejon said Noriega was held for five hours. It was notclear if Noriega was released before or after the final violentassault on the headquarters that led to the rebel forces' surrender.   ``He was confident that elite forces and the special forces andrest of the officers and soldiers of the Defense Forces were goingto solve the problem immediately, as it happened,'' Castrejon added.   Castrejon spoke briefly to reporters in front of Defense Forcesheadquarters Wednesday and did not say who coordinated the rescueand counterattack operation.   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity inWashington, said they were mystified by the decision to let Noriegago.   ``Noriega was in their clutches,'' said one U.S. officialWednesday.   The United States has been trying to oust Noriega since February1988, when he was indicted on drug trafficking and money launderingcharges in Florida.   If things had gone right for the rebels, ``Noriega would havebeen at night court in Miami listening to a judge telling him hewas being detained without bail,'' one U.S. official said wistfully.   However, U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said U.S.officials didn't know how long Noriega had been held and toldreporters, ``Clearly they (his captors) were not of a mind to turnhim over to us.''   In Panama City, neighbors said they saw Noriega enter DefenseForces headquarters with members of his staff Tuesday morning, andthat the shooting began about 10 minutes later. They spoke oncondition of anonymity.   During the fighting Castrejon made a television announcementsaying Noriega was in an undisclosed location and was in radiocontact with his troops.   Later, Maj. Edgardo Lopez, a Defense Forces spokesman, saidNoriega had personally taken the rebels' surrender, meaning he wason the spot when the fighting ended.   The headquarters building is a four-story structure thatoccupies an entire city block. The Urraca company, whose soldierswere involved in the coup attempt, is located in barracks across asmall patio in the same Defense Forces compound that extends forseveral hundred yards along Panama Bay.   Jose Blandon, a Panamanian defector once close to Noriega, saidin Washington he had been told by a coup leader over the telephoneduring the uprising that the general had been wounded, but whenNoriega appeared before television cameras later there was no signof an injury.   Asked why the rebels would decide to free Noriega, one U.S.official said, ``It's crazy. I don't understand it.''   The U.S. officials said they are concerned that the rebels facea bleak future in detention. The sources said some of theinsurgents involved in the March 1988 uprising are still beingtortured.   U.S. officials have refused to comment on reports that some ofthe rebels took refuge at U.S. Southern Command headquarters inQuarry Heights, a few hundred yards from the fighting.   Asked if anything positive occurred during Tuesday's events, theofficials said Noriega had tried hard through purges to ensure theloyalty of the Defense Forces but was still unable to head off anuprising.   Tuesday's coup attempt also was much closer to succeeding thanthe 1988 insurrection, the officials said, adding that Noriega'sown behavior Tuesday evening indicated how close he had come tobeing deposed.   Noriega was ebullient after riding out the earlier coup and wasfar more subdued this time, they said.   By Wednesday, however, Noriega leaned out a window to wave to acheering crowd of supporters outside his bullet-pocked headquarters.</TEXT></DOC>
