At this stage the uncertainty associated with the parametervalues are represented by pdfs elicited from subjective expert judgement.At the later stages of a site investigation measured data would becomeavailable. Bayesian methods can then be used to incorporate measureddata into subjective pdfs. This report describes the results of threecase studies which illustrate the feasibility of using Bayesian methodsto update subjective prior distributions. The first case concerns thehydraulic conductivity of the vault backfill material and used a simplemodel of measurement errors. Following this, two cases were conductedon the conductivity of the Corallian aquifer underlying the Harwell site.These cases used a more complex model comprising multiple rock layersand a relationship with depth. All three cases show that Bayesian methodscan be successfully used to update subjective pdfs and that the updateddistributions incorporate the information contained in both the measureddata and the prior distribution.</TEXT></DOC>
