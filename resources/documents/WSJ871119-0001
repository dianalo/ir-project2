But he has warned that a settlement must come soon.    &quot;I am rather disappointed that no settlement has been reached,&quot; Bhopal District Judge M.W. Deo told the two sides in a court appearance. But he set another court date for Nov. 27, giving the sides nine more days to talk.    &quot;I cannot allow things to go on delaying like this,&quot; he said. Mr. Deo has allowed two of his own deadlines for the settlement -- Oct. 30 and Nov. 18 -- to pass. If the two sides don't reach a settlement, then the judge could start proceedings to bring the case to trial. The Indian government is suing Union Carbide for $3 billion. Private parties also have filed 523,770 claims against Union Carbide in the Bhopal court.    Both the Indian government and Union Carbide said negotiations are continuing on how much to pay the victims of the gas leak, considered the world's worst industrial accident, and on a schedule for disbursements. Union Carbide's director for corporate communications, Robert M. Berzok, said: &quot;Both sides would like to reach an agreement. Both sides are working to that end.&quot;    But even if the two sides agree soon, many people in New Delhi and Bhopal don't expect any announcement until the current session of the Indian Parliament ends Dec. 11. The government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi could face intense criticism of any settlement that falls short of the $3 billion it has claimed in court, especially in the feisty Parliament.    The hearing in Bhopal Wednesday took place in a tense atmosphere. The Bhopal courthouse was placed under tight security, and demonstrations were held in front of the courthouse against a possible settlement that would fall short of the $3 billion claimed by the government. The city itself, except for some tea shops, was shut down in a citywide strike protesting any out-of-court agreement. All schools were closed. Placards outside the court, hoisted by a communist group, read: &quot;Down with unjust, inadequate, out-of-court settlements.&quot;    In India, Union Carbide has disclosed to the local and foreign press its current offer, which totals $496.2 million over 10 years of installments. But a source close to the negotiations said the company has the financial strength to settle for as much as $650 million on a lump-sum basis, or as much as $1 billion if the payments are stretched out over time.    But in Danbury, Conn., a company spokesman declined to comment on those press reports. He said the talks are &quot;continuing in earnest with the government of India to reach a fair and equitable settlement.&quot;    In India, Union Carbide said the government has agreed to a schedule of 10 payments over 10 years, plus a framework for the agreement that identifies four areas of compensation and the number of victims deserving compensation. The company said it will give compensation to the families or heirs of 2,660 people killed in the accident, 20,000 severely injured and 186,000 partially affected. The fourth category includes the building of a new hospital in Bhopal, rehabilitation programs, damage done to the environment and claims by corporations and government bodies hurt by the accident.    Union Carbide said it is willing to offer $20,000 for the family of each person killed in the accident, in equal installments spread out over 10 years, and half that amount for the severely injured. The people partially affected would be given $500 in a lump sum. Lastly, the company would pay $150 million for the items in the fourth category of compensation.    Yesterday, however, India's attorney general, K. Parasaran, said he was unaware of any such offer by Union Carbide. &quot;We have not seen any such proposal,&quot; adding, &quot;Nothing definite can be said about the settlement.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
