Minor changes in franchise laws or regulations were madelast year in a few states, including Louisiana, Arkansas, andVirginia. But it's been five years since the number of stateswith franchise laws (currently 16) has increased. Tight statebudgets are one big reason for the inactivity, as it can becostly to administer a franchise law.</LP><TEXT>   Legislative activity could pick up this year if theeconomy continues to be sour. &quot;During times of decliningsales and profitability, franchisees in certain cases aremore willing to better their situation by going to thelegislatures for help,&quot; said Neil Simon, who tracks stateactivity for the International Franchise Association, aWashington, D.C., trade group.   Iowa is one state being watched in 1992. A move is underway by several franchisees to push a bill to give them morepower in bargaining with large franchisers.   ---   DADE COUNTY, FLA., becomes the first locality to adopt afamily-leave law.   Employers with at least 50 workers will have to offer upto 12 weeks of unpaid leave every two years to care for anewborn or adopted child or to deal with a serious familyillness. The measure, passed in mid-December, goes intoeffect in March. The new law applies only to Dade companies,but county commissioners claim they won't do business withlarge companies outside the county that do not have afamily-leave program.   Women's groups generally praised the bill. &quot;This offers arealistic approach to today's society,&quot; said Evelyn Shea,spokeswoman for the Florida Federation of Business andProfessional Women's Clubs. But some business leaders opposedit, contending that it would be a disincentive for newbusinesses to locate in the county.   The only dissenting Dade County commissioner was MaryCollins, the lone woman, who worried that jobs will be lost.   ---   PRIVATIZATION: Small companies win about 80% of the awardswhen state and local governments contract out services withthe private sector, a study funded by the Small BusinessAdministration concluded. It also found that mostjurisdictions provide some support -- from seminars andworkshops to waiving bonding rules -- to encourage smallcompanies to bid. Still, the study found, small companiesface disadvantages when substantial capital equipment isneeded or when a single contract covers a large geographicarea or a large quantity of services.   ---   GRAND FORKS, N.D. plan to aid businesses draws plauditsand copycats.   In 1987, voters in the North Dakota community of nearly50,000 overwhelmingly passed a one-cent sales tax andearmarked about one-third of the proceeds for a so-calledGrowth Fund. The fund provides financial help with little redtape involved to new or expanding businesses, most of whichare small, in Grand Forks and surrounding smaller towns. Theaid is designed to create new jobs, expand the property-taxbase, and diversify a local economy largely dependent onagriculture, an Air Force base and a university.   So far, the plan &quot;has exceeded expectations,&quot; said JohnO'Leary, community-development director of Grand Forks.Initially, the city council expected the program to generate100 new jobs a year at an average cost of $10,000 a job.Instead, the 14 businesses that have received slightly morethan $3 million in total aid have sparked 650 new permanentjobs, at an average cost of just $4,615 a job.   Among those helped: small manufacturing andfood-production businesses and some service andhealth-related concerns. A Canadian bus company was lured tobuild a plant employing 50. Growth Fund applications areconsidered by an advisory panel, which includes owners ofsmall businesses.   Several other North Dakota cities, including Minot,Williston, and Jamestown, have since passed similar economicdevelopment plans, and cities throughout the U.S. haverequested information from Grand Forks.   ---   RECESSION SPURS a big increase in rate of U.S. businessfailures.   Nationally, the rate of business failures -- most of themsmall companies -- surged nearly 50% in the first sevenmonths of 1991, reflecting the breadth of the economicrecession, according to Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp., which trackssuch statistics. But the increases were much higher in someregions: 86.2% in New England, 82.1% in the Middle Atlanticstates of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, and 78% inthe Pacific states, including Alaska and Hawaii.   Registering the smallest increases were the West SouthCentral states of Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Texas, uponly 12.3% overall, and the East North Central states ofOhio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, up 32.4%.   But there were big differences among some states within asingle region. While Iowa recorded a 51% drop in failures,neighboring Minnesota registered a 182% jump during the thefirst seven months of 1991, the most recent statisticalperiod. Although Hawaii posted a steep 76% drop in failures,Oregon's number soared nearly 400% in the period.   A Dun andamp; Bradstreet spokesman said it's unlikely that thepercentage changes for business failures recorded for all of1991 will vary that much from those posted for the firstseven months.</TEXT></DOC>
