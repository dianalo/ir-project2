Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><TEXT>   Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts rolled inexorably to easy victories in Democratic primaries in Ohio and Indiana, while his last remaining rival, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, picked up the District of Columbia.    Partial returns showed Mr. Dukakis winning 65% to 24% in Ohio and 68% to 24% in Indiana. Mr. Jackson was leading by 77% to 21% in the District of Columbia. The day's work brought Mr. Dukakis's delegate total close to 1,500, fewer than 600 short of the 2,081 delegates he will need to win the Democratic nomination.    Mr. Jackson, campaigning during the day in Ohio and in the District of Columbia, took a few jabs at Mr. Dukakis, arguing the Massachusetts governor &quot;has operated with caution when we must operate with clarity and courage and candor.&quot;    But, in fact, both he and Mr. Dukakis were looking well beyond these primaries. Mr. Dukakis and his advisers were reaching out to party professionals to join them in a campaign to defeat Vice President George Bush in the general election. Mr. Jackson was looking beyond this election to the future of what has become a powerful movement rallying around him in American politics.    The Dukakis forces signed up in advisory capacities two important party professionals: Richard Moe, who had been a senior adviser to Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, and Kirk O'Donnell, formerly a top aide to former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill. Mr. O'Donnell, director of the Center for National Policy, had been neutral in the race. Both met earlier in the week with Gov. Dukakis's campaign manager Susan Estrich and Boston pollster Thomas Kiley.    Mr. Dukakis and his senior advisers are expected to sign up more party professionals, including several who worked for other candidates. That should speed along the wooing of delegates now pledged to Mr. Gephardt, Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee and Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, all of whom have dropped out of the race.    It is a slow process that should give Mr. Dukakis enough delegates to win the nomination by the time the last delegate votes are counted in June.    On Monday, for example, Mr. Dukakis picked up about 16 superdelegates -- party leaders and elected officials who have automatic slots at the convention. He continues to add to his count in caucus states that are still moving slowly from tier to tier in their delegate-selection processes. He claimed 10 more yesterday in Minnesota and nine more in Washington state.    &quot;It's no flood, but we're steadily picking up delegates,&quot; said Susan Brophy, the chief Dukakis delegate hunter. &quot;Months and months of work are paying off.&quot;    His growing confidence was reflected in the decision to campaign only two days for the West Virginia and Nebraska primaries next Tuesday. The campaign season comes to a mighty finish June 7 in California, with 314 delegates on the line. Polls show Mr. Dukakis leading there too.    Mr. Dukakis continues to ignore Mr. Jackson's jabs -- &quot;I'm not just a talker, I'm a doer,&quot; he keeps saying. Now he's concentrating his fire on Mr. Bush, who has already wrapped up his party's nomination and held a belated celebration last night in Washington.    Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Dukakis took swipes at each other, in a kind of spring practice for the fall campaign.    Mr. Bush charged Mr. Dukakis was inexperienced in foreign policy and tried to paint the Massachusetts governor as the spiritual heir of Jimmy Carter, governor of Georgia before he moved to the White House. At the Bush victory rally, the vice president's son George Jr. said, &quot;We want you to go out there and kick some Michael Dukakis, and kick him hard.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis, ignoring Mr. Jackson, criticized Attorney General Edwin Meese by saying, &quot;We want an attorney general that you and I can be proud of, not ashamed of.&quot; He criticized the Reagan administration, too, for not supplying housing for the homeless and day care for children.    He said he wanted to know why the administration was &quot;doing business with (Manuel) Noriega, why they were paying off Noriega, why they were doing business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator.&quot;    Mr. Bush, long distance, fired back. &quot;I can't wait for Mr. Dukakis to discuss the Noriega matter,&quot; he said. The vice president said he wanted to hear what Mr. Dukakis would do in handling &quot;delicate Central American relationships.&quot;    Mr. Jackson gave hints in his speeches every now and again that he knows the battle for the presidential nomination, this time, is over. He, too, is looking down the road. &quot;You can't just vote,&quot; he told Ohio college students. &quot;You must join for the long haul. You must make this an effort to go beyond a given date.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
