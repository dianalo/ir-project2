The Davis, Calif., company said initial results from field tests with Russet Burbank potatoes in Idaho indicate that potato plants engineered for resistance to two common potato viruses are showing &quot;consistent immunity&quot; to them. Currently, the viruses reduce the U.S. potato crop.    Calgene disclosed the results at the first symposium on the Molecular Biology of the Potato, held in Bar Harbor, Maine. Earlier this year, the company received a patent on a genetically engineered tomato that remains firm longer than untreated tomatoes. </TEXT></DOC>
