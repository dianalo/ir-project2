Seed irradiation impaired the dynamicsof sprouts and decreased the percentage of emerged plants. Undesirablechanges increased with the application of higher doses of the radiation.The impairment of sprouting dynamics and the decrease of the percentageof emerged plants were significantly lower in autotetraploid form. Therelative survival of plants after seed irradiation decreased in bothdi- and autotetraploids. However, it was found that the response of theform 2x and 4x to the same doses of radiation was significantly differentiated.In all the cases the relative survival of diploid plants was higher thanthat of autotetraploids. The protective influence of additional genomesof an autotetraploid form of pea, observed during plant sprouting ofgamma-1 generation, was levelled at the stage of generative reproduction.</TEXT></DOC>
