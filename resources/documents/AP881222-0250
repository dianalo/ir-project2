From the start, the government's tactic was to give a break toeach person it caught in return for his help in bringing down others.   It was May 12, 1986, when the Securities and Exchange Commissioncharged Drexel's Dennis Levine with making $12.6 million in profitsfrom illegal trading on inside information.   Levine was arrested and agreed to surrender the money, pleadguilty to criminal charges and cooperate with the government.   From Levine, the government progressed to Ivan Boesky. The stockspeculator agreed on Nov. 14, 1986, to pay a record $100 millionpenalty to settle charges of trading on inside information suppliedby Levine in 1985 and 1986.   Boesky's testimony helped the government extract penalties from avariety of lesser Wall Street figures. On Feb. 13, 1987, Martin A.Siegel resigned as a managing director of Drexel and pleaded guiltyto illegal stock trading and tax evasion.   Along the way, Levine was sentenced to two years in prison andBoesky to three. Boesky remains incarcerated; Levine got out early.But attention shifted to Drexel and whether the firm itself _ notjust individual executives _ would be prosecuted.   On Sept. 7 of this year, the SEC formally accused Drexel of arange of securities fraud violations in a civil suit that assertedthe firm had conspired with Boesky. The case was stalled by pretrialarguments over the impartiality of the presiding judge, MiltonPollack.   On Wednesday, the other shoe dropped as Drexel agreed to aproposed settlement in which it would plead guilty to six federalfelony counts and pay a record $650 million fine to settle thebiggest securities fraud case in history. The agreement requiresapproval of senior Justice Department officials and the SEC.   Overshadowed by the Drexel deal was the indictment Wednesday ofPaul A. Bilzerian, a takeover speculator who was accused of lying tothe government and illegally hiding stock. Bilzerian, too, was anindirect victim of Boesky's disclosures.</TEXT></DOC>
