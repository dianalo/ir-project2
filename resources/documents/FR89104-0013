On September 28, 1984, notice was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (49 FR 38252) announcing final approval of theState's plan and amending Subpart R of Part 1952.By letter dated September 29, 1986, from Jim Robison, Commissioner, toJames W. Lake, Regional Administrator, and incorporated as part of theplan, the State requested the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA) to resume jurisdiction and enforcement authority over private sectoremployers working within the boundaries of Denali (Mount McKinley) NationalPark.This action was taken as a result of an inspection the State conductedof a private sector employer at the Park. Because of the employer's questioningof the State's jurisdiction, the Alaska Attorney General reviewed the caseand issued an opinion that section 11(a) of the Alaska Statehood Act, byproviding for exclusive Federal jurisdiction within Denali National Park,specifically precludes the State from enforcing civil or criminal lawsand regulations within the boundaries of the Park. Therefore, private sectoremployers working within the boundaries of Denali (Mount KcKinley) NationalPark are under Federal OSHA jurisdiction.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Assessment</ITAG>Amendment of Part 1952 is not a ``major'' action as defined by ExecutiveOrder No. 12291 (46 FR 13193, February 19, 1981) as it will not have anannual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, cause major increasesin costs or prices, or have any other significant adverse effects. Amendmentof Part 1952 will not constitute a ``major rule'' primarily because noadditional requirements will be imposed on employers, since Alaska's occupationalsafety and health standards are substantially similar to Federal OSHA's.For the same reason it is certified that pursuant to the provisions ofthe Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 5 U.S.C. 601) amendmentof Part 1952 will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Participation</ITAG>The purpose of the present rule is to amend 29 CFR 1952.242 to reflectthe change to the level of Federal enforcement described above. The AssistantSecretary has determined that good cause exists for publication of theamendment as a final rule with an immediate effective date because thechange is procedural in nature and is the result of a legal interpretationof an existing State statute. Accordingly, public participation would beunnecessary.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 29 CFR Part 1952 </ITAG>Intergovernmental relations, Law enforcement, Occupational safety and health.<ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC, this 20th day of December, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John A.

OSHA retains full authority over issues whichare not subject to State enforcement under the plan. Thus, Federal OSHAretains its authority relative to safety and health in private sector maritimeactivities and will continue to enforce all provisions of the Act, rulesor orders, and all Federal standards, current or future, specifically directedto maritime employment (29 CFR Part 1915, shipyard employment; Part 1917,marine terminals; Part 1918, longshoring; Part 1919, gear certification)as well as provisions of general industry standards (29 CFR Part 1910)appropriate to hazards found in these employments.
