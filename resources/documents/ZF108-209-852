(New Media) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Rosenthal, Steve.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Multimedia systems require complex hardware, often includingmultiple video recorders and players, slide projectors, or otherdevices.andP;  The Macintosh can control most devices, but each needs adedicated RS-232 serial link and the standard Mac has only twobuilt-in serial ports.andP;  Apple's Desktop Bus is designed to run upto 16 devices simultaneously, but is too slow for video-editingapplications at 4.5K-bps.andP;  Videomedia Inc's V-LAN UniversalControl Network lets users run multiple devices with separate8-bit controllers from a single serial port.andP;  It is powerful butcostly at $1,000 per node.andP;  Consumer-electronics giant Philipssponsors two standards useful for the Mac: Inter-IntegratedCircuit (I2C), which runs up to 100K-bps, and Domestic Digital Bus(D2B), a distributed serial bus capable of controlling up to 50devices from up to 150 meters away.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     BusesMultimedia TechnologyEditingPeripheral ControllersDigital Signal Processing.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Multimedia hardware catches the busandM;You have to be really wired to keep up with new media: For every new piece ofhardware, it seems you need up to half a dozen cables running across yourdesk.andM;Take, for example, video editing.andP;  To make an efficient editing system, youneed to control at least two playback decks, a record deck, perhaps aspecial-effects generator and a switcher.andP;  While the entire system shares afew video signal lines, each device needs its own set of dedicated controlwires.andM;Or consider a synchronized slide show, where you have half a dozenprojectors.andP;  Every projector needs its own control wire.andP;  For a corporatepresentation you ought to be able to dim the room lights and start a videoprojector without an assistant.andP;  You can do it, but your Mac ends up lookinglike a spider web.andM;Right now, most devices can be controlled by a Mac, but the standardconnection for each one is a dedicated RS-232 serial link.andP;  Unfortunately, astandard Mac has only two built-in serial ports, and most of us have tiedthem up with a network and a modem.andM;It's time to think about an alternative.andP;  One solution that looks good isreplacing point-to-point wiring with a shared bus-style connection.andP;  Youcould then route one wire between all your devices and get rid of the tangledweb.andM;Looking at ADB.andP;  At first I thought the answer might be the Apple DesktopBus, built into all Macintoshes since the SE and used to connect the Mac tokeyboards, mice, trackballs and other input devices.andP;  The ADB was designed torun up to 16 devices at a time and is under-used.andM;Moreover, ADB seemed better matched to the task than the other built-inalternatives.andP;  The SCSI bus doesn't have enough addresses and is too costly.andO;AppleTalk is better, but expense and loading might be a problem.andM;Seehorn says.andP;  I asked Larry Seehorn, a designer of Mac-based editingsystems, whether he had considered using the ADB.andP;  Yes, he told me, but hedecided that the system was too slow for video editing.andP;  The ADB runs at 4.5Kbps.andP;  When you're fast-forwarding two decks at the same time and trying toread the full-time code (a set of eight digits that precisely identifies eachvideo frame) from each, ADB can't keep up, Seehorn said.andM;Instead, Seehorn is using the V-LAN Universal Control Network system fromVideomedia Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif.andP;  Like a faster version of ADB, V-LANuses eight-bit controllers for every device -- and requires only one serialconnection from the Mac to the V-LAN controller.andP;  For professional videoequipment, V-LAN might be a good solution.andP;  But at nearly $1,000 per node,it's obviously not the way to reach a mass market.andP;  I went looking for othersolutions.andM;One place I looked was consumer electronics.andP;  There I found that global giantPhilips is using two standards that might be interesting for the Macintosh.andM;The I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) standard was designed for use between thechips in digital television sets and accessories.andP;  It's not much fordistance, but it can run up to 100 Kbps.andP;  Philips already makes inexpensivevideo chips with I2C connections built in.andM;Philips also is sponsoring a device-to-device bus called D2B (DomesticDigital Bus).andP;  It's a distributed serial bus with a range of up to 150 metersand up to 50 devices.andP;  D2B should start appearing on some U.S.andP;  products nextyear.andM;Waiting for the CEBUS.andP;  The most intriguing possibility I found on my searchwas a domestic solution.andP;  The Electronic Industries Association is sponsoringthe CEBUS (Consumer Electronics Bus).andP;  Like AppleTalk, CEBUS is designed towork with a variety of connections, including power-line signaling and fiberoptics.andP;  It will control everything from washing machines to television setsand VCRs.andP;  There's even an optional double-coaxial cable for multiple videochannels.andM;You won't start seeing CEBUS on video equipment until next year, but in a fewyears this could be the bus that drives all those extra cables from thedesktop.andP;
