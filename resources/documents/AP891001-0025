Sunday's election also was the first for the administration ofnew Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and was regarded as an indicationof public sentiment as Japan prepares for elections for the morepowerful lower house.   Itsuo Nomura, an attorney and local assembly member from thegoverning Liberal Democratic Party, received 467,643 votes, or 51percent.   Socialist candidate Shizue Hosogane had 394,123 votes, or 43percent. Communist candidate Setsuo Yamada received 52,642, or 5.7percent.   The election was to fill the vacancy left by the death in Augustof Liberal Democratic Party legislator Niro Iwakami.   ``No words can express my feelings now,'' Nomura said in atelevised interview as he celebrated his victory in Ibaraki, 65miles northeast of Tokyo. ``I feel a great responsibility.''   The Socialists had campaigned primarily on a platform ofabolishing an unpopular sales tax the Liberal Democrats pushedthrough late last year.   The 3 percent tax, part of a sweeping change that includedincome tax cuts, is widely opposed by merchants and lower- andmiddle-income consumers.   A bill to abolish it was submitted in the opposition-dominatedupper house last week. The Liberal Democrats now are working out acompromise tax revision in an effort to deflect criticism.   ``This is a victory for the new Kaifu Cabinet and shows thepeople's faith and understanding of our plans for tax revision,''Chief Cabinet Secretary Ichiro Ozawa, the main governmentspokesman, said at a news conference.   Ms. Hosogane, the Socialist candidate, told reporters: ``The(Liberal Democrats) stressed it would `revise' the tax and thepeople seemed to accept that, even though the government has notmade clear in any way how it will go about it.''   Socialist Party Secretary General Tsuruo Yamaguchi said ontelevision the election ``was a question of either abolishing thetax or maintaining it. We weren't able to get that message acrossadequately to the people of Ibaraki.''   The Socialists also had hoped that Ms. Hosogane, a schoolteacherand a political novice, would attract voters who are tired ofveteran politicians and who want to see Parliament invigorated byfresh faces.   Rocked by money and sex scandals and outrage over the tax, theLiberal Democrats lost their majority in the upper house in Julyfor the first time since the party was formed in 1955.   The party retains its majority in the lower house and has beentrying to restore its popularity before the next lower houseelections, possibly in January. The elections must be held beforeJuly 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
