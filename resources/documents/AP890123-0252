Indeed, Nicaragua produced one of the Hispanic world's greatpoets, Ruben Dario, who died in 1916. But although Dario is reveredas a strongly nationalist poet, he lived outside the country formost of his life.   Under the long rule of the Somoza family that began in 1936,there was censorship and little encouragement from the stateregarding the arts. However, the Sandinistas, who took over after arevolutionary war in 1979, put a lot of emphasis on all forms ofculture. Artists, dancers, musicians and writers are ecouraged byseveral government organizations.   Still, writers who don't tow the Sandinista line have troublegetting published, said Pablo Antonio Cuadra, a noted poet anddirector of the opposition newspaper La Prensa, which has beeninvolved in frequent bitter conflict with the Sandinista government.   ``The Sandinistas say I'm the only poet opposed to the regime,but there are a lot of disenchanted poets,'' he said.   ``Some of our best young poets are in exile _ in Texas, inVenezuela. They're not Contras, but they are not Sandinistas,either,'' said Cuadra, interviewed by telephone in Austin, Texas,where he has taken leave from La Prensa to write a study of CentralAmerican literature with the help of a grant from the GuggenheimFoundation.   Diaz Castillo said New Nicaragua wanted to publish one ofCuadra's books two years ago; Cuadra said he refused because he hasa contract with a Costa Rican publisher and he also suspected theSandinistas were trying to score propaganda points by publishing asymbolic book by an opponent.   The roots and implications of the Sandinista revolution are thedominant subjects of New Nicaragua's list. Many of the rulingSandinista leaders themselves are writers, and a list of authorsfrom New Nicaragua can look like a who's who of the government.   Vice President Sergio Ramirez is a novelist. Agrarian ReformMinister Jaime Wheelock is a historian. First lady Rosario Murillois a poet, as is former culture minister Ernesto Cardenal.   The emphasis on the arts led to an outpouring of poetry.Romantic, revolutionary war poems, once relegated to the backs ofclandestine notebooks, made it into print.   Gioconda Belli, one the nation's most popular poets, writes richodes that couple love, eroticism and strong hope of a bettertomorrow. Murillo, the common-law wife of the president, also writesmostly love poems based on the ideals of the revolution.   ``Gioconda Belli is a good poet,'' said Cuadra. ``But remember,she's a Sandinista.''   The man considered by most as Nicaragua's finest living poet,Carlos Martinez Rivas, is on New Nicaragua's list but of ageneration apart from the revolution. One of his poems is a tributeto Charles Darwin, another a four-line poem called ``Retrospection1940-1980.''   Ramirez, vice president and one of the most popular novelists,recently published ``Castigo Divino,'' or ``Divine Punishment.'' Itwas first printed in Spain, and he went to a round of publicationparties in Spain and Mexico, where it sells for about $20. The NewNicaragua edition is doing well here despite the price, theequivalent of almost $2, close to a week's pay for many Nicaraguans.   The book, a spicy fictionalized account of a scandalous murder inthe 1930s, was also serialized in the Sunday supplement of thepro-government newspaper El Nuevo Diario.   ``The theme shows that a leader in the revolution doesn'tnecessarily have to write about the revolution,'' Ramirez said.``The only political part of this book is that all the earnings willbe used for a war fund.''   Ramirez said the proceeds would be donated to children orphanedduring the seven-year war with anti-Sandinista rebels.   He was asked in a recent interview how he finds time to turn outbooks: ``It takes discipline, especially with my schedule. But Ijust sit and write,'' he said.   One of the most popular writers is Omar Cabezas, whose 1982 book``La Montana Es Algo Mas Que Una Inmensa Estepa Verde'' wastranslated into English and sold as ``Fire on the Mountain.''   The story of his days as a guerrilla fighter was Nicaragua's bestseller, with more than 100,000 copies in four editions, DiazCastillo said.   Cabezas just released his second work, a sequel entitled``Cancion de Amor Para Los Hombres,'' or ``A Love Song for Men.'' Areview in the Sandinista party newspaper Barricada described thebook as ``not only as good as the one before, but superior in somecases.''   Diaz Castillo, the director of one of two state-run publishinghouses, said he receives many unsolicited manuscripts but thenation's economic crunch forced a cut in production.   When the company started in 1981, Diaz Castillo said, ``Weprinted 6,000 copies of five books. In four months we were all soldout. It was an adventure.''   Today, New Nicaragua is one of two state-run houses and publishesabout 20 books a year, most of them by young authors writing aboutthe revolution, including stories about battles, feminist storiesand stories about Augusto Cesar Sandino, who gave his name to theSandinista Front.   Cuadra said he likes Ramirez' short stories. He compared``Castigo Divino'' to a non-fiction novel such as Truman Capote's``In Cold Blood,'' but said he thought only someone in Ramirez'position would get away with writing such a book.   ``Sometimes I think it's better if the state doesn't getinterested in literature,'' Cuadra said. ``It's better if it remainsfree.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, Feb 3-5</NOTE></DOC>
