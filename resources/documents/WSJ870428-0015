SchlesingerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/28/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CEARNINGS (ERN)AUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) </IN><DATELINE> HIGHLAND PARK, Mich.  </DATELINE><TEXT>    Chrysler Corp. reported thatfirst-quarter net income dropped 24%, largely because thecompany lost production of high-profit-margin cars while itretooled three major plants, and because of expensivefinancing incentives.   Chairman Lee A. Iacocca also said at a news conference that the company will change its executive bonus system, tying the rewards more to long-term performance and stock value than the current system, which pays cash bonuses for the previous year's performance. General Motors Corp. announced a similar change earlier this month.    Chrysler earned $269.7 million for the quarter, or $1.24 a share, compared with the year-earlier period's $356.9 million, or $1.57 a share, adjusted for a 3-for-2 stock split earlier this year. The Chrysler Financial Corp. subsidiary, which is included in the overall financial results, reported profit of $61.6 million for the quarter, up sharply from the year-earlier $39.1 million.    Revenue increased 4%, to $6.03 billion from $5.78 billion. World-wide factory sales grew to 570,002 vehicles from 556,711 in the year-earlier period.    The quarter's earnings fell on the low end of a range predicted by analysts earlier this month. Donald DeScenza, an auto analyst with Nomura Securities International Inc., said the results confirmed his longstanding recommendation to sell Chrysler stock. &quot;Their corporate overhead increased by 29%,&quot; he asserted. &quot;That's disproportionately faster than sales,&quot; he said, adding that he expected sales could soon decline. Chrysler shares closed yesterday at $35.375, off $1.375, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    But Mr. Iacocca said those expenditures were an investment in the company's future, and he cited the company's plans to introduce 12 products over 18 months as a major reason for the earnings drop.    &quot;We did spend a little over $600 million in the quarter to redo some of our plants and bring out the new products,&quot; Mr. Iacocca said. &quot;We spent more money in the last 90 days on plant and product than Chrysler made net profit between the years 1925 and 1982.&quot;    Those investments also cost the company revenue by temporarily reducing production, particularly seven weeks' worth of its high-margin Fifth Avenue, Plymouth Gran Fury and Dodge Diplomat models, Mr. Iacocca said. He added that &quot;we also spent a lot more than we budgeted to match our competition, or in our case to go one better, in the incentive wars.&quot; Chrysler is currently offering loans at rates as low as 3.7% or rebates of as much as $1,000 on some of its models.    Mr. Iacocca did acknowledge that costs have risen &quot;higher than planned,&quot; and said the company hopes to cut $500 million in expenses this year through a variety of measures, including a hiring freeze, new limits on overtime pay and merit pay for certain salaried employees, and various budget cuts. He said the company is also asking suppliers for a 2.5% price cut.    On the other hand, Chrysler benefited substantially during the quarter from the drop in the dollar's value against the yen. Mr. Iacocca said some Chrysler models now sell for as much as $2,000 below comparably equipped Japanese competitors. &quot;I'm leading the charge for a trade bill,&quot; he said, &quot;but 85% of Chrysler's problem is gone. Keep the yen-dollar around some reasonable balance . . . and we'll knock 'em dead.&quot;    Despite delays in the company's attempt to buy American Motors Corp., Mr. Iacocca said he was &quot;optimistic we can conclude the talks within the next 10 days.&quot; He declined to specify what was holding up negotiations with Regie Nationale des Usines Renault, AMC's principal stockholder, but said the snag was &quot;usually money.&quot; The sides have set a deadline of next Tuesday to complete the arrangement.    Chrysler currently pays executives a cash bonus pegged to a handful of performance measures from the previous year, but Mr. Iacocca said the company would probably change that. &quot;It's too short-term. You should tie your actual compensation to how you do over a running period of time, say a car cycle three years out,&quot; he said. &quot;The truth is we'll probably have to go the stock route, because in that case as it goes up, everybody's boat rises with that tide.&quot;    He said the company hadn't worked out all the details, but would do so in the next few months. </TEXT></DOC>
