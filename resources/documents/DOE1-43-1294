<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-43-1294 </DOCNO><TEXT>The properties and applications of composite materials are examined inan introductory textbook for senior and graduate engineering students.Chapters are devoted to glass, B, C, organic, ceramic, and metallic fibers;polymer, ceramic, and metallic matrix materials; polymer-matrix composites;MMCs; ceramic-matrix composites; CFRPs; and multifilament superconductingcomposites. Consideration is given to the micromechanics of composites,macromechanical characteristics, strength, fracture, fatigue, and designproblems. Diagrams, graphs, photographs, and tables of numerical dataare included, and a set of problems is given for each chapter.</TEXT></DOC>
