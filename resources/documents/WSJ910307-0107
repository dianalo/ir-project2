Onebook is sociology: a detailed picture of black poverty andthe ways it has and has not changed in a half-century. Thesecond book is history: a rich, often enthralling story ofwhite America's brief attempt to deal with this misery,through the War on Poverty. The third element is a plea forblack and white Americans to come together in a second, moresuccessful crusade against poverty. On the whole, thesecomponents deftly reinforce each other. Together, they make&quot;The Promised Land: The Great Black Migration and How ItChanged America&quot; (Knopf, 410 pages, $24.95) a compelling andoriginal work that may well, as Mr. Lemann hopes, galvanizeat least some indifferent Americans to try to heal theghetto.   Mr. Lemann begins stunningly by framing his material in anew, suggestive way, isolating as his subject a change so bigthat many Americans have hardly noted it: the migration fromSouth to North, over five decades, of six million poor,uneducated blacks. He traces one small group of migrants fromtheir sad sharecropper beginnings in Mississippi to theiroften even more unhappy ends in the drug-ravaged high-risesof the Chicago ghetto.</LP><TEXT>   Scores of interviews in both places help Mr. Lemannreconstruct the texture of black life: the impossibledraftiness of a plantation cabin and the stench of urine in aproject entryway, the countless small hurts of Jim Crow andthe engulfing violence of gangland Chicago. The result is notso much novelistic -- although the book focuses on a handfulof characters, they remain sketchy figures -- as mural-like:a vast, multipaneled tableau that is at once sweeping anddense with evocative detail. Mr. Lemann's polemical aim is topaint a picture of the underclass with &quot;a human face&quot; --that, he believes, is the only way to catch white America'sinterest -- and, by and large, he has succeeded.   Another third of the book -- and by far the mostcompelling reading -- traces the inside story of the War onPoverty. This free-standing chapter is a journalistic tour deforce, contemporary history at its most gripping and vivid.Drawing on papers of three presidents and countless aides,Mr. Lemann has constructed a dramatic, behind-the-scenesaccount of how the war was fought and lost in Washington: thepressure to come up with a catchy solution, how momentumbuilt behind the wrong strategy and what happened when thegovernment tried too much too fast. Mr. Lemann does not thinkthe effort was a total failure. He sees it as a mix of suchpromising ideas as pre-school education and boondoggles likecommunity action programs meant to raise blacks by givingthem political power in the ghetto.   The third major strand in the book is a theoreticaldiscussion of the underclass. Among the most striking of Mr.Lemann's findings is that the familiar, self-defeating moresof the ghetto were already present in pre-war Mississippi:unstable marriages, out-of-wedlock births, widespread pettycrime and substance abuse. From this he concludes that themisery of the inner city must be caused, in part at least, bya &quot;culture of poverty.&quot; In this, Mr. Lemann stakes outimportant mid-ground between those, mostly on the left, whothink black poverty is a structural economic problem andthose on the right, who blame liberalism and welfare. Heargues convincingly, though delicately, for putting some onuson poor habits and attitudes.   In the same way, looking at the War on Poverty, he provesdevastatingly that programs meant to &quot;empower&quot; poor peopleand develop the ghetto -- just the sort of programs now beingrevived in Washington -- are probably the least effectiveremedies for what ails the underclass. What's needed instead,he argues importantly, is &quot;to bring the poor closer to thesocial and economic mainstream.&quot;   Here and there, Mr. Lemann's analysis runs ahead of hisstory. His demonstration of the similarities betweenMississippi and Chicago is at once stark and irrefutable. Atthe same time, as he notes, underclass pathology becamemarkedly more severe in big northern cities. Why? Mr. Lemannnever really says or shows us. He implies that the reason hasto do with the departure of the black middle class from theghetto. This may be so -- other experts think so -- but &quot;ThePromised Land&quot; does not quite sew up the case. The book doesnot explain why this should be true -- it hasn't been, afterall, for other immigrant groups.   Mr. Lemann also has some trouble using narrative to provethat a large federal program could significantly shrink theunderclass. His thesis is that the War on Poverty failed notbecause it could not work, but because we waged it badly.What's needed now, Mr. Lemann is convinced, is a vastnational campaign to spur &quot;acculturation&quot; of poor blacks --to teach discipline and responsibility as well as reading,writing and job skills. He makes a poignant case for trying.No one can doubt the need -- for reasons of national interestand altruism. Yet the skeptical reader still may not beconvinced that a big government program, imposed fromoutside, is the full answer for the daunting problems of theghetto.   Of course, Mr. Lemann knows his book cannot provide ablueprint. Now, as in the '60s, the first hurdle is politics-- finding the political will even to tackle the problem. Inthe racially jaded '90s, this will not be easy, though ifanything can spur momentum, perhaps &quot;The Promised Land&quot; will.   ---   Ms. Jacoby is writing a book about the fate of racialintegration.</TEXT></DOC>
