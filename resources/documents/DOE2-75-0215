In 1984, the US Fish and WildlifeService listed the US breeding population as endangered. In that yearthe University of Georgia's Savannah River Ecology Laboratory began anextensive research program on the breeding biology and foraging ecologyof Wood Storks of the Birdsville colony in Millen, Jenkins county, east-centralGeorgia, USA. The SREL Wood Stork program was designed to evaluate theimportance of foraging habitat on the Savannah River Plant to storks,and to design and develop management plans for artificial foraging pondsat the National Audubon Society's Silver Bluff Plantation Sanctuary.It was necessary to develop an understanding of the general foragingecology of the birds, and to understand their forage needs during thebreeding season. We have summarized the methods that we developed duringthis program as an aid to researchers studying storks or other wadingbirds. Although the methods described here were designed to answer questionsimportant to our program, we hope that they are general enough to behelpful to others. Some of the methods were designed in 1983, duringa preliminary part of the study. All the methods have evolved duringthe program, improving from our experience. Many people have been involvedin the study and all have contributed to the methods and their improvement.</TEXT></DOC>
