They were brought home by a British Airways jet diverted fromDubai to Kuwait to pick them up.   Lynda Chalker, a Foreign Office minister, met them at theaircraft door and led them to a VIP lounge where about 40 relativeswaited.   ``Everyone was charging around the lounge trying to find theirfamily,'' said Mark Appleby, 23. He was returning from a vacationin Thailand with his sister Nicola and family friend Sue Silcock,21, when the plane was hijacked early Tuesday and landed in Iran.   ``There was a lot of hugging,'' he said. ``There was laughingand crying. It was a great welcome back.''   Miss Silcock said she would celebrate her return with champagneand a cheddar cheese sandwich, the thought of which had ``kept megoing throughout the last few days.''   Simon Pollock, 26, hugged his mother and said: ``It's fantasticto be back. The only thing I thought about when I was there was myfamily, and now that I am with them again it is wonderful.''   Mrs. Chalker said: ``We learned the lesson that firmness doespay. We have to resist further hijacks.''   Some passengers, looking pale and drawn, left the airportquickly after the reunion, escorted by police, government officialsand airport security to their cars. Some leaned on the arms ofrelatives.   Fred Grant was in such a hurry to leave the airport that henearly missed his waiting family and friends.   Passengers said the hijacking was a frightening experience, butthe gunmen were considerate of the passengers, giving themblankets, pillows, food and water.   Scott Stillwell, a 23-year-old photographer, said: ``We weren'tharmed. They seemed very well trained. I don't think they areafraid to die.''   David Carew-Jones, 32, said, ``They didn't actually physicallymaltreat anybody. On the contrary, they were very attentive. Butyou always had to remember that they had a hand grenade in one handand a gun in another and they were wearing hoods. ... I mean, therewas always menace.   ``It could get quite relaxed and they would allow you to talk,go to the toilet, converse with people _ then suddenly, about onceevery two or three hours, they would put the lights out, saying `Notalking,' and they would stand at the front and scan you withtorches (flashlights).   ``You kept thinking that every time the torch fell on your faceit was somehow significant. That I found frightening.''   The hijackers, who demand that Kuwait release 17 Shiite Moslemsconvicted and imprisoned for bombing the U.S. and French embassiesthere in 1983, have released 33 men and 24 women. A total of 55people, including the hijackers, remained on the plane Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
