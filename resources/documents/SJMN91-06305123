The new, improved, undiluted IRA -- a retirement savingsand investment plan for all who work for wages.;   It took a stubbornrecession to do it, but a series of investment incentives is in the wind inWashington.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CONGRESS STUDIES NEW PROPOSALS TO REVIVE IRAS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     An upsurge of congressional interest in reviving the American economy withlower taxes could foreshadow a break for the nation's middle class, astimulant for business, and an expansion of the IRA program for savers andinvestors.;   You remember IRAs. Perhaps you still have one. But many holdersof Individual Retirement Accounts largely abandoned them when Congress reducedtheir tax deductibility feature five years ago.;   Now, with saving,investing, and economic recovery efforts attracting attention of lawmakers,the universal IRA is back in favor as part of proposed anti-recessionlegislation.;   &quot;For millions of Americans, the IRA is an old friend theywould like to have back,&quot; said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, the prime mover ofa drive to expand the IRA program, although other legislators are floatingsimilar proposals.;   The Texan's initiative has been getting most of theattention, largely because of his clout on Capitol Hill.;   &quot;As chairman ofthe Senate Finance Committee, Sen. Bentsen has the most influence in gettingsomething like this accomplished,&quot; said Jennifer Martin, assistant editor ofThe IRA Reporter, a newsletter that covers the issue.;   The Bentsen plan putsforth a tax cut proposal that would include IRA deductions of up to $2,000 ayear. That's the way it was 10 years ago when a limited IRA program thatstarted in 1974 was broadened to cover all workers.;   But what Congressgiveth, Congress taketh away. Its 1986 tax reform package limitedtax-deductible annual IRA contributions to most workers not covered by regularpension plans. That had the effect of sharply reducing taxpayer contributionsinto IRA accounts.;   From a peak of $38.3 billion in 1986, contributions inensuing years plunged. In 1990, the total new money going into IRAs was only$11.5 billion, according to an estimate by The IRA Reporter newsletter.;  Some of the current initiatives would restore the earlier arrangement that wasso popular. Others would provide something similar. An IRA restoration billproposed last spring by Bentsen and a Republican colleague, Sen. William Rothof Delaware, got nowhere. Last weekend, Bentsen announced a new version linkedwith tax-credit proposals.;   The IRA-tax cut plan of the senator from Texaswho was Michael Dukakis' running mate in the Bush landslide of 1988 is gettingenthusiastic reviews from surprising quarters. The Heritage Foundation, aconservative think tank in Washington, says the Bentsen plan would help&quot;generate economic growth.&quot;;   &quot;Because of his leading role in the Senate ontax matters, Bentsen's initiative dramatically increases the likelihood thatan anti-recession tax cut may become law,&quot; said Daniel J. Mitchell, a seniorfellow with the Heritage Foundation.;   Under current law, a fully deductible$2,000-a-year IRA contribution is available only to people not covered by apension plan and with individual income under $25,000 or family income under$40,000. The Bentsen plan would broaden it to cover all wage earners,regardless of income or other retirement arrangements, and would index it tothe inflation rate.;   Taxpayers would be given a choice: to take thededuction when the money is invested or not to pay taxes on the funds as theyare withdrawn. Penalty-free withdrawals could be made to pay for a first home,for college tuition, or medical expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of income.;  Another part of the Bentsen plan would grant a $300 tax credit for childrenunder 18. The entire package -- estimated to cost $72.5 billion over fiveyears -- would be financed by a 5 percent cut in defense spending.;   Thedownside of all the tax cut and IRA expansion proposals is the possibilitythat lower federal revenues would result, leading to still another increase ina budget deficit estimated at more than $300 billion. Supporters of the plans,however, argue that they will encourage Americans to work harder, save andinvest more, and move the economy upward. In the long run, they say, higherrevenues and lower deficits would develop.;   Tax relief is so politicallyappealing that several proposals have sprung up in Washington, although notall contain IRA provisions. One that does is the brainchild of two Republicans-- Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas and Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia.;   Their planincludes expanded IRAs plus a cut in the capital gains tax and a new taxcredit for first-time home buyers. Since it was initiated by Republicans, itcould be joined with a Bush administration plan that is still beingdeveloped.;   Among the proposals Congress could reckon with are some with IRAup-front deductions, some with tax breaks when money is withdrawn, and atleast one that would limit tax breaks to money that is earned from IRAcontributions.;   Of all the $528 billion poured into IRAs since the programbegan, the largest share -- about 24 percent -- has gone into mutual funds.The fund industry's trade organization, the Investment Company Institute, isoffering its help to proponents of expanded IRAs.;   &quot;It's not just good forour industry,&quot; said Erick Kanter, institute vice president. &quot;It's also goodpublic policy to get people to save more.&quot;;   About 22.4 percent of total IRAmoney is in banks, 17.4 percent in savings and loans, 10.8 percent investedwith insurance companies, and 5.4 percent in credit unions. About 20 percentis in &quot;self-directed&quot; accounts in which the investor periodically shifts fundsinto different investment categories.;   When will something concrete emergefrom this revival of interest in IRAs and tax breaks? There's no guaranteethat anything will happen.;   But Washington is teeming with tax cut talk andthe momentum for doing something is building. IRAs have taken on an aura notunlike motherhood and apple pie, with strong support for them in both housesof Congress.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JAMES RUSSELL, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911031  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  988  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, October 31, 199100305123,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
