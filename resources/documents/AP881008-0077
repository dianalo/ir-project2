Gen. Avril and Sgt. (Joseph)Heubreux; now we are disappointed,'' said opposition leader LouisDejoie Jr., who met with the two last week.   Dejoie and other political and labor leaders give Avril highmarks for his actions in the three weeks since Heubreux and otherenlisted men of the Presidential Guard deposed Lt. Gen. HenriNamphy and placed Avril in the presidency.   But concern is growing over Avril's close ties to thedictatorships that preceded him and a reported reluctance to callelections.   Dejoie referred to a story in the Paris daily Liberation, whichquoted Avril as saying Haitians are too poor for immediatedemocracy.   Avril has told some visitors elections probably won't be heldfor 2 years.   On Wednesday, a popular priest said Avril could not be trusteduntil he eliminates the dreaded Tonton Macoutes, the private armythat operated under dictators Francois and Jean-Claude Duvalier.Members of the Tonton Macoutes have been blamed for the Sept. 11killing of 13 parishoners and wounding of more than 70 at St. JeanBosco Roman Catholic Church.   ``The people do not trust you; (the people) should consider allbig-shot Duvalierists as big time criminals until they prove thecontrary for the rest of their lives,'' the Rev. Jean-BertrandAristide said in remarks directed to Avril in a radio speech.   The young priest is considered one of Haiti's most popularfigures among the poor.   Dejoie said Avril must declare his government short-term andprovisional and reinstate the suspended 1987 constitution.   Dejoie said Avril also must arrest and try the thugs responsiblefor the church slayings and for the deaths of 34 voters during theaborted presidential election in November.   He called Avril's statement that Haitians are not ready fordemocracy an insult to the people and proof that he ``has not yetdivorced himself from Duvalierism.''   ``We are not impatient. Two and a half years have gone by sincethe fall of the Duvalier regime. We are overpatient,'' said Dejoie.   Haiti was ruled for 29 years by Francois Duvalier and then hisson, Jean-Claude, who fled the country in February 1986 afterwidespread unrest. Namphy led a junta until February, when civilianPresident Leslie Manigat was sworn in. Namphy ousted Manigat inJune.   Avril is a close friend of the younger Duvalier and became amillionaire as Duvalier's financial adviser.   Rene Theodore, leader of the Haitian Communist Party, saidAvril's future authority is linked to bringing about democracy inHaiti.   ``Whatever Avril might personally desire, he participates in andis controlled by a situation he did not make himself,'' Theodoresaid Tuesday, one day after meeting with Avril and Heubreau.   The soldiers sent Namphy into exile in the Dominican Republicand forced Franck Romain, ousted mayor of Port-au-Prince and analleged leader of the Macoutes, to seek political asylum in theDominican Embassy.   Avril also retired Col. Jean-Claude Paul, former commander ofthe 700-man Dessalines Battalion. On Sept. 30, soldiers arrestedabout 30 alleged Macoutes linked to the church massacre.   Paul, who has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami ondrug trafficking charges, was considered the commander most likelyto lead any resistance to the rebellion. He is reported under housearrest.   Dejoie said he had gone to Washington seeking support for aprovisional government until elections are held.   The U.S. government has withheld aid to Haiti.   ``They still see Avril as involved with Duvalierism,'' Dejoiesaid. ``Avril's tarnished image improved after the coup d'etat, butnot enough to shine.''</TEXT></DOC>
