The students joined a school boycott that began in Kosovo'sprovincial capital of Pristina last Thursday to protest purportedharassment by ethnic Albanian classmates, said the sources inPristina, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   At the rally in the Serbian city of Cacak, 75 miles southwest ofBelgrade, demonstrators demanded that leaders responsible for thetrouble in Kosovo be held accountable, the official Tanjug newsagency reported.   ``The people have said what they had to say, now it is up to theCentral Committee of the League of Communists (Communist Party) totake action,'' Bole Lukic, a local Communist leader, told cheeringprotesters.   He referred to a forthcoming Central Committee session which isexpected to deal with the Kosovo issue and may result in toppersonnel changes.   ``As long as radical changes do not take place ... Serbia willnot calm down,'' Lukic declared.   The Slav minority in Kosovo, Yugoslavia's poorest region, claimsit is being harassed, intimidated and forced to leave the provinceby the ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo'spopulation.   Most of the Slavs are Christians. Most Kosovo Albanians areMoslems.   The Serbian republic, one of six republics constitutingYugoslavia, includes Kosovo.   Earlier Tuesday, about 3,000 Slav children from Klina and Pectraveled 30 miles by train to Pristina, determined to stage astreet protest to air their grievances, the sources told TheAssociated Press.   Also Tuesday, about 200 Slav university professors and studentsorganized a protest meeting at Pristina University, saying theywill not attend classes scheduled to start Oct. 1, the sources said.   Fearing ethnic violence, the federal government sent policereinforcements this month to Kosovo. The Albanians there have notreacted to date to a recent spate of protest rallies organized bySerbs and Montenegrins.   Kosovo's Albanians are descended from Illyrian tribes thatpopulated the area from ancient times. Slavs conquered Kosovo inthe seventh century, but were defeated in 1389 by Turks who ruledthe region until 1913.   Kosovo borders Albania.</TEXT></DOC>
