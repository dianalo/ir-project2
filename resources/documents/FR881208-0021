Lewis, 202-755-7787.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Program Purpose </ITAG>Head Start is a national program providing comprehensive developmentalservices primarily to low-income preschool children, age three to the ageof compulsory school attendance, and their families. To help enrolled childrento achieve their full potential, Head Start programs provide comprehensivehealth, nutritional, educational, social and other services. In addition,Head Start programs are required to provide for the direct participationof parents of enrolled children in the development, conduct, and directionof local programs. In FY 1987, Head Start served 446,523 children througha network of 1,290 grantees and 620 delegate agencies, each of which hasan approved written agreement with the grantee to operate a Head Startprogram. While Head Start is targeted primarily on children whose families haveincomes at or below the poverty line or are eligible for public assistance,Head Start regulations permit up to 10 percent of the Head Start childrenin local programs to be from families who do not meet these low-incomecriteria. Head Start also requires that a minimum of 10 percent of theenrollment opportunities in each State be made available to handicappedchildren. Such children are expected to be enrolled in the full range ofHead Start services and activities in a setting with their non-handicappedpeers and to receive necessary special education and related services.The Head Start program presently operates with two paid staff (one teacherand one aide) and, whenever possible, a volunteer in each classroom. Appropriatetraining is provided to staff and program volunteers. Head Start programs may currently operate one or more of five program options:Standard Head Start operates for five days per week and can be part dayor full day.  Variations in Center Attendance operate for four days or less per week.Double sessions operate with a teacher who works with two groups of children,one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Home-based programs provide weekly home visits to the child's parents andhave an organized socialization experience for a small group of childrenapproximately once each month. Locally designed options are programs designed to meet the unique needsof the local community, and are operated with special approval from theAdministration for Children, Youth and Families (ACYF). <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Purpose of the NPRM </ITAG>The purpose of this proposed rule is to ensure that Head Start programsmaintain levels of quality that will continue to promote long range benefitsto children and families. The proposed program staffing requirements havebeen developed to assure that Head Start children are being served by qualifiedstaff. The requirements regarding program options have been developed toidentify the levels of service that grantees must provide to children andparents in operating a Head Start program. In addition, as required by section 108 of Pub. L. 98-558, these proposedadditions and revisions to the Head Start regulations do not result inthe elimination of, or any reduction in, the scope or types of health,education, parent involvement, social or other services required to beprovided under the Performance Standards in effect on November 2, 1978.ACYF is proposing that this NPRM supercede some existing Head Start regulationsand policies. Other Head Start regulations and policies are incorporatedor recodified within the NPRM. The Redesignation Table found in sectionVI. of the Preamble specifies the superceded regulations and policies.It also identifies new requirements. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Data Used in the Development of the NPRM </ITAG>Background This NPRM proposes new requirements regarding program staffing and options,including staffing patterns, staff qualifications, staff and volunteertraining, hours and days of operation and class size as a new Part 1306,Head Start Staff Requirements and Program Options. Research and other dataindicate that the program variables addressed in this Notice of ProposedRulemaking (NPRM) directly affect program quality and the number of childrenthat can be served on an annual basis. Basis for Change The changes proposed in this NPRM are a result of findings from researchstudies, data from Head Start information systems and current informationregarding effective early childhood education programs. <ITAG tagnum="81">Research </ITAG>The National Day Care Study (Abt Associates, 1980) addresses the issuesof teacher qualifications and class size. There is evidence that childrenin programs with staff trained in early childhood education and developmenthad better relationships with the teacher, were able to complete more projectsand showed significant gains in skills and knowledge. This Study also reported the advantages of preschool classrooms with smallergroup sizes. Teachers engaged in more social interaction with childrenand less passive observation of activities. Children in smaller groupsmade greater gains on tests of cognitive skill, showed more cooperativebehavior with peers, more verbal initiative in giving opinions, providinginformation, stating preferences and exhibited more reflective or innovativebehavior in play or in assigned tasks. In addition, children showed fewernegative behaviors of hostility or conflict with others and were less likelyto wander aimlessly around the classroom or to be uninvolved in activities.A number of studies indicate that longer hours of service produce moreand longer lasting gains for children (Head Start Synthesis Project, 1985;Head Start Measures Project, 1987). The 1985 Head Start Measures Projectindicated that the effectiveness of the program depended on the time thatchildren and teachers were engaged in learning activities. The 1969 WestinghouseStudy showed that summer programs (approximately 240 hours of servicesper year per child) provide insufficient contact with children and familiesto result in long range benefits. Based on this information, on the experience of the agency and on generalpractice in child development programs, a minimum number of hours of servicewas determined. The Home Start Evaluation Study (1976) was implemented to review the methodologyand effectiveness of home-based programs. That study found home-based programseffective when home visitors worked with 10 to 11 families. When home visitorsworked with more than 12 families, however, home visits were made lessfrequently resulting in a decline in children's development in the areasof school readiness and language development. <ITAG tagnum="81">Head Start Information Systems </ITAG>There are two relevant Head Start data collection systems. The Head StartProgram Information Report (PIR) provides program information on actualHead Start services provided to children and families. The Head Start CostAnalysis System (HSCOST) provides information on planned program designand cost. Combined, the two data bases provide information on both theefficiency and effectiveness of individual Head Start programs. These systemsprovided information that was used as a basis for raising issues and posingquestions regarding the implementation of the Head Start program. The explorationof these issues resulted in this proposed rule. Both data sources highlight differences among programs and regions. Theyprovide information regarding such variables as class size, hours of serviceand program option being implemented: Currently, the average class size in Head Start is 18 children. The rangeis 12 to 22 children. Across the nation, the average center-based Head Start grantee offers aprogram of approximately 718 hours of service per child per year, but thevariation among regions and programs is great. Full day programs offeran average of 1,223 hours per year to approximately 18% of the childrenserved nationally. Programs implementing the variations in center attendanceoption offer an average of 544 service hours annually to 15% of the children.Part day programs offer an average of 734 hours per year to 32% of allHead Start children. Part day and variation programs that operate doublesessions offer an average of 475 hours per year to 26% of all Head Startchildren. Home-based programs provide approximately 129 hours of serviceper year to 8% of the children. The questions raised by these variations revolve around what is adequatein terms of:<ITAG tagnum="14">Providing effective services resulting in long range benefits to childrenand families, and, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Operating as efficiently as possible so as to be able to serve asmany children as possible.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Current Information From the Field of Early Childhood Education </ITAG>Because research findings are often not definitive, early childhood professionalshave long recognized and endorsed ``best practices'' as developmentallyappropriate for young children and their families. Opinions and ideas regardingthe effectiveness and efficiency of Head Start were solicited from professionalsin the field of early childhood education and Head Start. These professionalsinclude Head Start grantee and delegate agency staff (directors, educationcoordinators, teachers, etc.), training and technical assistance providersand the National Head Start Association Board of Directors and members(a national organization representing Head Start directors, parents, staffand friends). The contents of this rule regarding hours of service, staffingand options reflect the comments and ideas offered by the professionalsand others in the early childhood education field. In addition, the National Association for the Education of Young Children,a national organization that represents early childhood professionals,has developed <T3>Accreditation Criteria and Procedures of the National Academy of EarlyChildhood Programs</T3> (NAEYC, 1984) to which we looked for guidance.The Academy's <T3>Criteria</T3> confirm that low enrollment limits and trained staffare important to the success of any preschool program. We have focused our efforts in four major areas: 1. <T3>Program Flexibility.</T3> One of the strengths of Head Start is thatlocal programs have the flexibility to design the program to meet specificcommunity needs. The result of this flexibility is that there is a widevariation in the manner in which local Head Start programs are implemented,which is generally a tribute to the ingenuity of Head Start program operators.The intent of this NPRM is to retain that flexibility, within parametersthat protect program quality, by setting minimums or ranges on those programvariables that affect long range benefits to children and families. 2. <T3>Program Options.</T3> ACYF is proposing that this NPRM incorporateinto a new Part 1306, Appendix A of 45 CFR Part 1304, Program Options forProject Head Start. The NPRM also revises the program options requirementsbased on the need to relate program goals and design to community needsand on the need for sufficient hours and days of program operations. TheNPRM also further specifies the various program options available to localHead Start programs and consolidates in one place all the information oneach option which is presently scattered throughout Head Start requirements,manuals and other policy issuances. 3. <T3>Hours and Days of Operation.</T3> Based on data cited above, ACYF proposesto set minimum hours and days of operation for both the center-based andhome-based program options. The specific requirements for each programoption include days of planned classroom operation, number of group socializationactivities and number of home visits to be made by the teaching staff orhome visitors.Currently, the frequency and length of this contact time vary tremendouslyacross the country and among regions. Some programs operate for a numberof hours that is insufficient to provide an adequate amount of contactbetween the program and the child and family. This NPRM will require thatthose programs increase the amount of contact time being provided.4. <T3>Class Size.</T3> ACYF proposes to specify the minimum, maximum andaverage grantee class sizes that are acceptable for Head Start based onthe ages of the children being served and the type of center-based programoption being implemented. These proposed requirements are fully consistentwith research findings regarding group size (Abt, 1980), the recommendationsof early childhood professionals and information on current good practices(NAEYC, 1984).<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Section by Section Discussion of the NPRM</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart A</ITAG>Subpart A, General, of the NPRM sets forth the purpose and scope of theproposed rule, proposes an effective date and provides definitions of termsused. Subpart A also indicates that the rule is not applicable to the 35existing Parent Child Center programs which serve children below the ageof three.In andSection;1306.2, we propose to allow current grantees two years to comeinto compliance with the staff qualification requirements and at least180 days to come into compliance with the program option requirements.New grantees must meet all requirements of the final rule at the time theyare funded.<ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart B</ITAG>Subpart B, Head Start Program Staffing Requirements, sets forth programstaffing requirements for all Head Start grantees and delegate agenciesregardless of the program option being implemented. This subpart consolidatesand clarifies existing staffing requirements and introduces new requirementsregarding staff qualifications.Section 1306.20 Program Staffing Patterns.Section 1306.20 specifies that center-based programs must employ two staffpersons responsible for each classroom (a teacher and a teacher aide) andmust have a volunteer in the classroom whenever possible. Home-based programsmust employ home visitors. Both classroom staff and home visitors mustbe able to communicate with the families they serve and must be familiarwith the ethnic background of those families.These requirements are designed to assure that sufficient adults are availableso that children in the classroom can be provided with individualized attention.They are also designed to assure that families that participate in thehome-based program will receive the individualized attention needed tomeet the needs of the parents and children in that family.Section 1306.21 Staff Qualification Requirements.Section 1306.21 specifies, for the first time, staff qualification requirementsfor classroom staff and home visitors. The competence of the Head Startteacher and home visitor is one of the most important determinants of thesuccess of the program. It is the training and experience of this staffthat enables them to provide high quality and age appropriate experiencesto children. Accordingly, ACYF proposes to require a minimum level of trainingfor teachers prior to being put in charge of a classroom and for home visitorsprior to being put in charge of a group of home based families. One wayto meet these requirements is to hire teachers and home visitors with ChildDevelopment Associate (CDA) credentials. Individuals with CDAs have demonstratedtheir competence in working in center- or home-based child developmentprograms.The Administration for Children, Youth and Families encourages public commenton those activities and efforts that will be needed to insure that qualifiedteachers and home visitors are available to fill vacant positions. We areparticularly interested in ways programs could provide training or helppersons obtain the credentials necessary to become home visitors. Possibleapproaches might include hiring staff as home visitors trainees or providingtraining to staff currently employed in other positions.Section 1306.22 Volunteers.Current Head Start policies in the Head Start Manual of Policies and Instructionsregarding volunteers are incorporated in andSection;1306.22. The proposedregulation requires that all programs have a system for actively encouragingvolunteer participation and that special efforts must be made to have volunteerparticipation, especially parents, in the classroom. Volunteer participationmust be organized so that there are specific opportunities to work at meaningfultasks both within the classroom and in other program and administrativeareas.Section 1306.23 Training.Current Head Start regulations regarding staff and volunteer training arefound in 45 CFR Part 1304, Appendix A. These requirements are incorporatedin andSection; 1306.23 of the proposed regulations.<ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart C</ITAG>Subpart C, Head Start Program Options, sets forth the proposed requirementsregarding the direct service options that can be implemented by Head Startgrantees and delegate agencies. It supercedes existing requirements foundin 45 CFR Part 1304, Appendix A. The requirement at Appendix A, developedprior to the promulgation of 45 CFR Part 1304, the Head Start performancestandards, contained a number of requirements related to parent involvement,education services, social services, nutrition and other Head Start components.These component requirements are being deleted as they are covered by theHead Start performance standards. These deletions are not to be interpretedas a de-emphasis on any Head Start program component.The subpart details ranges of acceptable operations in regard to classsize and hours and days of operation for each of the options.Section 1306.30 Provision of Comprehensive Child Development Services.This section incorporates existing requirements found in 45 CFR Part 1304,Appendix A, section A. It requires that grantees provide comprehensivechild development services to all children enrolled in the program, meetthe Head Start Performance Standards, provide classroom or home-based groupsocialization experiences for all children, provide home visits to allparents and utilize community resources to the greatest extent possible.We are proposing a new requirement in andSection; 1306.30(c) that the facilitiesfor regularly scheduled center-based classroom or home-based group socializationactivities must meet State and local licensing standards. Depending onvarious State and local licensing standards, this may include classrooms,outdoor play areas or, in some cases, homes. This new requirement is proposedto further ensure the health and safety of the Head Start children beingserved. In cases where no State and local licensing standards are applicableor where these licensing standards are less comprehensive than Head Startregulations, programs are required to assure that their facilities arein compliance with the Head Start Performance Standards related to healthand safety found in 45 CFR 1304.2-3.Section 1306.31 Choosing Head Start Program Options.This section incorporates existing requirements found in 45 CFR Part 1304,Appendix A, section A. It allows grantees and delegate agencies to implementa center-based program option which focuses on delivery of services tothe child, a home-based program option which focuses on delivery of servicesto the parents, or both options with different groups of children.Some Head Start grantees may prefer to implement the center-based programoption in which priority is placed on providing services to children ina classroom setting. This option encompasses those options previously termedstandard option, part day and full day, double sessions and variationsin center attendance. Other Head Start grantees may prefer to implementa home-based program option when the age or other characteristics of thechildren indicate the importance of working directly with parents to enhancetheir role as the primary factor in the development and education of theirchild(ren). Head Start grantees also have the option to implementing botha center-based and a home-based program.Both home-based and center-based options as specified in the proposed ruleallow sufficient flexibility for local grantees and delegates to be ableto implement programs that provide serves appropriate to individual childrenand the families being served.The Administration for Children, Youth and Families is aware that someHead Start grantees operate programs that combine aspects of both center-and home-based options. Some of these combination programs do not meetthe minimum requirements of this NPRM for either option. This NPRM doesnot presently include a third option that would allow and regulate theseprograms. However, we are interested in public comment on these programsin three areas:The goals and effectiveness of such programs, and the possibility of includinga combination model as a third option in the rule.Recommendations regarding acceptable minimums or ranges for days and hoursof operations that a combination model would need to provide to assuregains to children and families. Minimums might be two days per week plusthree home visits a month for thirty two weeks of operation or three daysper week plus two home visits a month for thirty two weeks of operation.The likely impact of this rule on existing combination programs if no thirdoption is allowed.Section 1306.32 Center-Based Program Option.This section specifies the requirements for the operation of a center-basedprogram including class size, hours and days of operation, double sessionand full day variations.Paragraph (a) defines a Head Start class as a group of children, a qualifiedteacher, an aide and a volunteer and specifies new requirements for classsize. It defines the appropriate size of the group of children based onthe predominant age of the children in the class and whether or not theprogram is single or double session. Identifying the predominant age ofthe children in the class makes it possible to determine allowable classsizes for multi-age classrooms. Identifying whether a class is single ordouble session allows us to take into account the workload of the doublesession teacher.The chart found in the proposed rule at andSection; 1306.32(a)(11) summarizesthe new class size requirements which are based on funded enrollment. Minimumand maximum class sizes have been specified to ensure that Head Start canreach as many children as possible while still providing quality services.The Administration for Children, Youth and Families is interested in publiccomment on whether or not Head Start can operate both effectively and efficientlywithin these requirements.For the first time in Head Start regulations, proposed class size is morestringent for the implementation of double session classes than for theimplementation of single session classes. Paragraphs (a)(4) and (6) setlimits on double session class size to ensure that no teacher will be responsiblefor more than 34 children. This limit is imposed to make sure that teachershave time to provide individualized services to all children and stillhave sufficient time for recordkeeping, planning, home visits and parent-teacherconferences.Paragraph (b) contains proposed new regulations on minimum days per week,days per year and hours per day that grantees must provide center-basedclassroom operations. It specifies that programs providing 4 days eachweek of classroom operations must provide a minimum of 128 days per yearof classroom operations. Programs providing 5 days each week of classroomoperations must provide a minimum of 160 days per year of classroom operations.The number of days required are exclusive of holidays and vacations which,when factored in, will increase the number of operating weeks. Establishingseparate days of operation for four day and for five day programs willresult in both types of programs operating for a minimum of approximately32 weeks over an eight or nine month period.Center-based programs will be expected to operate for at least the numberof days specified in this proposed rule. Classroom operations should onlybe cancelled due to factors beyond the control of the program (adverseweather conditions, emergencies, etc.). When cancellations do occur, programsshould make every effort to make up the cancelled days of class using existingresources. Makeup classes must be provided if cancellations result in lessthan 128 days of class.Paragraph (b) also allows grantees to implement a program with a combinationof four and five days per week and to pro-rate the minimum required numberof days of service based on 32 weeks of scheduled days of classroom operations.This program allows the fifth day of the week to be used alternately forclassroom operations or for staff training, home visits, parent-teacherconferences or other relevant activities. In no instance are programs whichoperate five days per week being encouraged to reduce the number of daysper week of operation except as noted below in andSection; 1306.32(c) regardingdouble session programs.Paragraph (b) has the effect of requiring that grantees and delegate agenciescurrently operating two or three days per week must increase their daysof classroom operations to at least four days per week if they intend tocontinue to provide center-based program services. As an alternative, thesegrantees and delegates can choose to implement a home-based program asdefined in andSection; 1306.33, but only if the needs of children and familiesin the community indicate that such a change is appropriate.Minimum requirements and acceptable ranges for planned hours per day arealso proposed in paragraph (b). Both days and hours of operation includethe scheduled days and hours of classroom operations during which timechildren are expected to be involved in learning opportunities, field tripsor receiving Head Start nutrition or health services. These days and hoursare exclusive of scheduled vacation days or holidays, the child's travelto and from the center or time for staff planning and record keeping. Programsare also expected to employ staff for an amount of time that allows themtime, when children are not present, for pre-service training, for programstartup and close down, for required record keeping and planning and forhome visits and parent teacher conferences.The NPRM includes a required minimum of 3\1/2\ hours of classroom operationper day. The Administration for Children, Youth and Families is aware thatsome Head Start grantees presently operate double session programs thatmay make it administratively difficult to operate for longer than 3 hoursper day. We are also aware, however, that a 3\1/2\ hour day is developmentallyappropriate for a Head Start child and think that the use of staggeredworking hours or additional part time or swing personnel will make it possiblefor double sessions to operate for the required hours. The Administrationfor Children, Youth and Families is interested in public comment on thedifficulties and costs grantees would encounter putting this requirementinto practice.In the center-based option, the current requirement for two home visitsfor each child to be conducted by the child's teacher is found under 45CFR 1304.2-2(e). This requirement is recodified in paragraph (b)(8) ofthis section. Home visits focus on parental goals for the child based onstaff and parents' perceptions of the child's needs and progress.Paragraph (b)(8) proposes a new requirement which specifies that each programmust conduct two parent-teacher conferences during the school year foreach child in a center-based program. These conferences, to be held inthe Head Start Center, will be helpful to both the teacher and parent.They provide a formal opportunity to explore the child's progress withinthe classroom context and allow the teacher to show the parent specificactivities and activity areas in which the child is involved. During thefirst conference, parents can provide useful information to the teachingstaff about their child at the beginning of the program year. During thesecond conference, teachers can explain the child's progress to the parentsbefore the child leaves the program.Since the parent-teacher conference is traditionally used by public schools,its use in Head Start is also an effort to make the transition from HeadStart to the public school system easier for both children and parents.Head Start grantees are responsible for setting up and implementing a systemto conduct home visits and parent-teacher conferences. The purpose of thissystem is to provide a vehicle for working with parents as the prime educatorsof their children. In those instances when parents implicitly or explicitlyrefuse to participate, the program must try to convince them of the usefulnessof these activities and to encourage them to participate. Under no circumstances,however, is the program to drop the child from the center-based programif the parents will not participate in the visits and/or the conferences.The center-based program option allows the implementation of two center-basedoption variations: double session and full day. Both of these variationsmust comply with the general requirements set forth in andSection; 1306.32(a) and (b) for center-based program operations with specific additionsand exceptions.Section 1306.32(c) discusses the double session variation. As previouslymentioned, the proposed regulations regarding double sessions are morestringent in terms of class size. In addition, paragraph (c) requires thatdouble sessions operate for no more or less than four days per week toensure that teachers have adequate class time to provide individualizedservices to all children and still have sufficient time for recordkeeping,planning, home visits and parent-teacher conferences. This may requirethe employment of additional part-time personnel or staggered times ofstaff arrival and departure.Section 1306.32(d) defines full day as the provision of more than six hoursof classroom operations per day using Head Start funds. Existing policieson the use of Head Start funds to provide full day services (TransmittalNotice 72.6) are incorporated in this paragraph. They require a searchfor alternative resources for implementing full day services and that fullday services be provided based on the needs of individual children.ACYF acknowledges that many Head Start families have a need for full dayservices. Head Start, however, does not have the resources to provide asubstantial amount of full day care for children. Therefore, we are proposingthat grantees work with State and local organizations to secure alternativeresources to extend the services past the normal hours of the Head Startprogram or to operate and charge for an extended day program that is notadministered under the Head Start Act. It should be noted that Head Startregulations at 45 CFR 1305.8 specifically prohibit Head Start agenciesfrom prescribing a fee schedule or charging fees for participation in theHead Start program itself.In instances where grantees decide to operate and charge for full day servicesoutside the normal hours of the Head Start program, they should developand follow operating rules and requirements that protect the health andsafety of the program participants and provide the kinds of services desiredand supported by the parents of the children being served. Head Start granteesmay wish to consider other variations for the non-Head Start portion ofthe day such as using a non-Head Start funded full day program as a mechanismfor providing after school care in addition to providing preschool services.Section 1306.33 Home-Based Program Option.This section proposes annual minimums of 32 home visits and 16 group socializationactivities per child in home-based programs. These minimums also includeminimum hours for home visits and group socialization activities whichare exclusive of scheduled vacations or holidays, the child's travel toand from the group socialization activities, the home visitor's travelto and from family homes and time for staff planning and record keeping.In the home-based option, home visits are conducted by trained home visitorsin the home and are designed to enhance the ability of parents to fostertheir child's growth and development.Home visits are to be made by the home visitor with the parent, fosterparent or guardian of the child or the persons with whom a child has beenplaced for purposes of adoption pending a final decree. Home visits arenot to be made with only a baby sitter or other temporary caregiver inattendance. Programs may need to be flexible and schedule home visits onweekends or during evenings in order to carry out a home-based programand conduct home visits with working parents, parents in training or schoolor with parents who are otherwise out of the house during weekdays.Group socialization activities must be designed to provide an opportunityfor peer interaction for the children and to provide parents with the opportunityto enhance their understanding of child development and their skills asthe primary educator of their children. In addition, there should be ampleopportunity for parents to participate in activities of their own choosing.As with home visits, the intent of these activities is to involve the child'sparent and not a babysitter or temporary caregiver.Based on research data, a maximum caseload of 12 families per home visitorhas been proposed in paragraph (a)(5). As with center-based programs, thepurpose of this requirement is to ensure adequate time for the provisionof quality services that will have long range benefits for Head Start childrenand their families.Paragraph (c)(3) requires that home-based programs follow the nutritionrequirements specified in 45 CFR 1304.3-10(b)(1) by providing appropriatesnacks and meals during group socialization activities. This requirementis included because the Performance Standards specify nutrition requirementsfor center-based programs, but not for home-based group socialization activities.Section 1306.34 Additional Head Start Program Option Variations.This section incorporates requirements related to Locally Designed Optionsthat are currently found in 45 CFR Part 1304, Appendix A, Section B.5.and in Transmittal Notice 72.11, N-30-211.a-1. Variations from the center-or home-based program options are allowable under this section for thepurpose of meeting unique local needs or demonstrating innovative approachesto the provision of services.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Resource Implications</ITAG>In order to comply with these regulations, some Head Start programs willhave to make changes in class size and/or hours and days of operation.Estimates of the cost of those changes can be made based on a variety ofassumptions.On the assumption that no children will be dropped from the program, estimatescan be made of the number of additional classes that would be needed toserve those children whose classes must be reduced in size. Estimates canalso be made of the additional resources needed to increase days and hoursof service. An alternative assumption is that children will be droppedwhere class size is too large and there are no classes with smaller numbersof children that can absorb them. In addition, it would be possible todrop classrooms in order to pay for additional hours and days of operation.In reality, the promulgation of this rule will probably encompass bothassumptions and increase total classes for some grantees and decrease thenumber of children served by other grantees. It should be noted that inno instances would currently enrolled children actually be dropped fromthe program. Decreases in enrollment would take place at the beginningof a new program year and would be accomplished by enrolling fewer children.Some programs will have to decide whether or not to change the programoption(s) they are presently operating. These are primarily center-basedprograms which are now operating split sessions (two and three days ofclassroom operations each week) or variations in center attendance.We estimate that the changes proposed in the NPRM will cost approximately$15 million, an amount equal to 1\1/4\ percent of current spending. Thesefunds are needed primarily to reduce class size and to increase the amountof contact between the program and the child and family.It is anticipated that these changes will not be required prior to FY 1990and will be implemented over a two year period. These cost increases canbe accommodated in current budget policy.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI.

Impact Analysis</ITAG>Executive Order 12291Executive Order 12291 requires that a regulatory impact analysis be preparedfor major rules, which are defined in the Order as any rule that has anannual effect on the national economy of $100 million or more, or certainother specified effects. Since nothing in the NPRM is likely have an effecton the economy of $100 million, the Secretary concludes that this regulationis not a major rule within the meaning of the Executive Order.Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. Ch.6),we try to anticipate and reduce the impact of rules and paperwork requirementson small businesses. For each rule with a ``significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities'', we prepare an analysis describingthe rule's impact on small entities. Small entities are defined in theAct to include small businesses, small non-profit organizations, and smallentities. While these regulations would affect small entities, these requirementsare not substantial and most Head Start programs already meet all or someof the proposals. We expect that less than 25 percent of the programs willhave to make changes in class size and less than 20 percent of the programswill have to make changes in the amount of contact with children and families.For these reasons, the Secretary certifies that this rule will not havea significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.Paperwork Reduction ActUnder the Paperwork reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-511, all Departmentsare required to submit to the Office of Management and Budget for reviewand approval any reporting or recordkeeping requirement inherent in a proposedor final rule. This proposed rule does not contain information collectionrequirements or increase Federal paperwork burden on the public or privatesector.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>45 CFR Part 1304Dental health, Education of disadvantaged, Grant programs_social programs,Health care, Mental health program, Parental Involvement, Nutrition.45 CFR Part 1306Head Start, Education, Grant programs/social programs, Handicapped, Pre-schooleducation.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 13.600, ProjectHead Start)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 8, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Sydney Olson,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Assistant Secretary for Human Development Services.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: June 21, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Otis R.

A double session class for four or five year old childrenmay have no more than 17 and no fewer than 13 children enrolled. See paragraph(c) of this section for other requirements regarding the double sessionvariation.(5) For classes serving predominately three year old children, the averageclass size of that group of classes must be between 15 and 17 childrenwith no more than 17 and no fewer than 13 children enrolled in any oneclass.(6) When double session classes serve predominately three year old children,the average class size of that group of classes must be between 13 and15 children. A double session class for three year old children may haveno more than 15 and no fewer than 13 children enrolled. See paragraph (c)of this section for other requirements regarding the double session variation.(7) A class is considered to serve predominately four or five year oldchildren if more than half of the children in the class will be four orfive years old by whatever date is used by the State or local jurisdictionin which the Head Start program is located to determine eligibility forpublic school.(8) A class is considered to serve predominately three-year-old childrenif more than half of the children in the class will be three years oldby whatever date is used by the State or local jurisdiction in which theHead Start program is located to determine eligibility for public school.(9) Head Start programs must determine the predominate age of childrenin the class at the start of the year. There is no need to change thatdetermination during the year.(10) In some cases, State or local licensing requirements may be more stringentthan these class requirements, preventing the required minimum numbersof children from being enrolled in the facility being used by the HeadStart program. Where this is the case, Head Start programs must try tofind alternative facilities that satisfy licensing requirements for thenumbers of children cited above. If no alternative facilities are available,the responsible HHS official has the discretion to approve enrollment offewer children than required above.(11) The chart below may be used for easy reference:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,xs72,r10</C> <H1>Predominate age of children in the class</H1><H1>Funded class size (funded enrollment)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">4 and 5 year olds<D>Program average of 17-20 children enrolled per class in these classes.No less than 13 and no more than 20 children enrolled in any class.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4 and 5 year olds in double session classes<D>Program average of 15-17 children enrolled per class in these classes.No less than 13 and no more than 17 children enrolled in any class.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3 year olds<D>Program average of 15-17 children enrolled per class in these classes.No less than 13 and no more than 17 children enrolled in any class.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3 year olds in double session classes<D>Program average of 13-15 children enrolled per class in these classes.No less than 13 and no more than 15 children enrolled in any class.</D></ITAG></ITAG> (b) <T3>Center-Based Program Requirements. </T3>(1) Programs must operate classesfor four or five days per week or some combination of four or five daysper week. (2) Programs must operate classes for a minimum of three and one half toa maximum of six hours per day with four hours per day considered to beoptimal. (3) The annual number of required days of planned classroom operations(days when children are scheduled to attend) is determined by the numberof days per week each program operates. Programs that operate for fourdays per week must provide at least 128 days per year of planned classroomoperations. Programs that operate for five days per week must provide atleast 160 days per year of planned classroom operations. Programs implementinga combination of four and five days per week must plan to operate between128 and 160 days per year. The minimum number of planned days of serviceper year can be determined by computing the relative number of four andfive day weeks that the program operates. All center-based program mustprovide a minimum of 32 weeks of scheduled days of classroom operationsover an eight or nine month period. Every effort should be made to schedulemakeup classes using existing resources if planned classroom days fallbelow the number required per year. (4) Programs must schedule makeup classes, when needed, to prevent thenumber of days of service available to the children from falling below128 days per year. (5) Each individual child is not required to receive the minimum days ofservice, although this is to be encouraged in accordance with Head Startpolicies regarding attendance. The minimum number of days also does notapply to handicapped children whose individualized education plan may requirefewer planned days of service in the Head Start program. (6) Head Start migrant programs are not subject to the requirement fora minimum number of planned days, but each migrant program must make everyeffort to provide as many days of service as possible to each migrant childand family. (7) Staff must be employed for sufficient time to allow them to participatein pre-service training, to plan and set up to program at the start ofthe year, to close the program at the end of the year, to conduct homevisits and parent-teacher conferences, to maintain records and to keepplans current and relevant. These activities should take place when noclassroom activities with children present are planned. (8) Head Start programs must develop and implement a system that activelyencourages parents to participate in two home visits and two parent-teacherconferences annually for each child enrolled in a center-based option.These visits and conferences must be initiated and carried out by the child'steacher. Programs may not, however, drop the child from the center-basedprogram if the parents will not participate in the visits and/or the conferences.(9) Head Start migrant programs are required to plan for a minimum of twoparent-teacher conferences for each child during the time they serve thatchild. Should time and circumstance allow, migrant programs must make everyeffort to conduct home visits. (c) <T3>Double Session Variation. </T3>(1) A center-based option with a doublesession variation employs a single teacher to work with one group of childrenin the morning and a different group of children in the afternoon. Becauseof the larger number of children and families to whom the teacher mustprovide services, double session programs must comply with the requirementsregarding class size explained in paragraph (a) of this section and withall other center-based requirements in paragraph (b) of this section withthe exceptions and additions noted in this paragraph. (2) Each program must operate classes for four days per week. (3) Each double session classroom staff member must be provided adequatebreak time during the course of the day. In addition, each teacher, aideand volunteer must have appropriate time to prepare for each session together,to set up the classroom environment and to give individual attention tochildren entering and leaving the center. (d) <T3>Full Day Variation. </T3>(1) A Head Start program implementing a center-basedoption with a full day variation provides more than six hours of classroomoperations per day using Head Start funds. These programs must comply withall the requirements regarding the center-based program option found inparagraphs (a) and (b) of this section with the exception of paragraph(b)(2) of this section regarding the hours of service per day. (2) Programs are encouraged to meet the needs of the families for fullday operations by securing funds from other agencies. A Head Start programimplementing a full day variation must determine that all alternative sourcesfor full day services have been contacted, that enrollment opportunitiesin other programs are not available for families and that non-Head Startresources are not available to operate the longer day. (3) Head Start programs may provide full day services only to those childrenand families with special needs that justify full day services or to thosechildren whose parents are employed or in job training with no caregiverpresent in the home. The records of each child receiving services for morethan 6 hours per day must show how each child meets the criteria statedabove. (4) Programs may consider charging for services which are provided outsidethe normal hours of the Head Start program. When this alternative is utilized,no Head Start funds may be used to pay for these services. Head Start space,however, that would otherwise be unused may be made available for otheractivities outside the normal hours of the Head Start program. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1306.33 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Home-based program option. </ITAG>(a) Programs implementing a home based option must: (1) Provide one home visit per week per family (a minimum of 32 home visitsper year) lasting for a minimum of 1\1/2\ hours each. (2) Provide, at a minimum, two group socialization activities per monthper child (a minimum of 16 group socialization activities each year). Eachgroup socialization activity must operate for a minimum of 3\1/2\ hoursto a maximum of 6 hours with 4 hours considered to be optimal. (3) Make up planned home visits or scheduled group socialization activitiesthat were cancelled by the program or by program staff if this is necessaryto meet the minimums stated above. Medical or social service appointmentsmay not replace home visits or scheduled group socialization activities.(4) Allow staff sufficient employed time to participate in pre-servicetraining, to plan and set up the program at the start of the year, to closethe program at the end of the year, to maintain records and keep planscurrent and relevant. These activities should take place when no home visitsor group socialization activities are planned. (5) Maintain an average caseload of 10 to 12 families per home visitorwith a maximum of 12 families for any individual home visitor. (b) Home visits must be conducted by trained home visitors with the contentof the visit jointly planned by the home visitor and the parent(s). Homevisitors must conduct the home visit with the parent(s). Home visits maynot be conducted by the home visitor with only baby sitters or other temporarycaregivers in attendance. (1) The purpose of the home visit is to help parents improve their parentingskills and to assist them in the use of the home as the child's primarylearning environment. The home visitor must work with parents to help themprovide learning opportunities that enhance their child's growth and development.(2) Home visits must, over the course of the year, contain elements ofall Head Start program components. The home visitor is the person responsiblefor introducing, arranging for and, in some component areas, actually providingHead Start services. (c) Group socialization activities must be focused on both the childrenand parent(s). They may not be conducted by the home visitor with babysitters or other temporary caregivers. (1) The purpose of these activities for the children is to emphasize peergroup interaction through age appropriate activities in a Head Start classroom,community facility, home or on a field trip. The children are to be supervisedby the home visitor with parents observing at times and actively participatingat other times. (2) The program must design these activities so that parents are expectedto accompany their children to the group socialization activities at leasttwice each month to observe, to participate as volunteers or to engagein activities designed specifically for the parents. (3) Programs must follow the nutrition requirements specified in 45 CFR1304.3-10(b)(1) and provide appropriate snacks and meals to the childrenduring group socialization activities. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1306.34 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Additional Head Start program option variations. </ITAG>In addition to the center/based and home-based program options as definedabove, the Administration for Children, Youth and Families retains theright to fund alternative program variations to meet the unique needs ofcommunities or to demonstrate or test alternative approaches for providingHead Start services.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-28231 Filed 12-7-88; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4130-01-M   </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
