(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A military judge Wednesday found Pvt.Adrian Morris Jr. guilty of two AIDS-related court-martial chargesbut acquitted the soldier of other charges.   Army Col. Raymond D. Cole convicted Morris of bringing discreditupon the Army for engaging in unprotected sex early in 1987 aftertesting positive for presence of antibodies to the AIDS virus andhaving been counseled to take precautions if having sex.   Cole also found Morris guilty of consensual sodomy withthen-Pfc. Anthony L. Baldwin during March 1987.   The judge acquitted Morris of aggravated assault against Baldwinand a soldier identified only as Pfc. Jane Doe. He also foundMorris innocent of two counts of conduct bringing discredit uponthe Army.   ``I am convinced the accused never intended to harm any of hissexual partners,'' Cole said in acquitting Morris of assault.   ``By God's good grace, and blind luck, no one was infected.''   Cole later sentenced Morris to receive a bad-conduct discharge,but did not set a specific date for it. Morris is scheduled forrelease from the Army in November.   The judge also restricted Morris for 60 days to Fort Huachucaoutside this southeast Arizona town, ordered him to forfeit $1,200in pay over three months and ordered him not to have unprotectedsex.   The sodomy charge alone carried a maximum term of five years inprison. Cole had indicated previously that he would not impose aprison term on a discredit conviction.   Morris hugged his mother after the sentencing and told reportershe was ``surprised because I was expecting the whole 17'' years inprison, the maximum penalty if he had been convicted of all thecharges. He said he had expected a heavy sentence ``because of theemotion surrounding it and the disease itself.''   Morris said he would not stay in the military even if hisautomatic appeal is successful, but he said, ``I don't feel anyremorse toward the Army and the press.''   The bad conduct dischage is considered better than adishonorable discharge because Morris may be entitled to retainsome veterans benefits.   Col. Harry C. Beans III, staff judge advocate at Fort Huachucawhose office prosecuted Morris, said he was trying to ``figure outthe judge's logic with our failure to prove an aggravated assault.Quite frankly, I thought we did it, I thought we made our case.''   Beans said, ``The sentence is light, but you can understand thatthis soldier has had this cloud hanging over his head for 17months.''   Morris, 28, of Caseyville, Ill., was accused of havingthreatened the health of Baldwin and two female soldiers by failingto use condoms during sex and by failing to warn them he had testedpositive for the AIDS virus, which indicated he may develop AIDSand could spread it.   He was the first member of the armed forces charged withAIDS-related offenses in March 1987. Legal issues delayed histrial, though, and military courts have tried other AIDS-relatedcases in the interim.   Cole said Morris' case was ``fact-specific,'' involvingknowledge about AIDS two years ago, and therefore would have littlevalue as a precedent in other cases.   Cole ruled after receiving written closing arguments from theprosecution and hearing oral arguments from the defense Wednesdayafternoon.   Capt. Gaylen Whatcott, the prosecutor, called 10 witnessesTuesday, including Morris' two alleged female victims. Theytestified that Morris had told them he had a rare or incurableblood disease but did not mention acquired immune deficiencysyndrome before having sex with them.   Cole permitted Whatcott to submit a transcript of pretrialtestimony from Baldwin after the government said it was unable tofind him for the trial.   Baldwin's 1987 testimony included a description of homosexualactivity with Morris.   In addition, the judge allowed the prosecution to admit medicalrecords reflecting Morris' AIDS test results, despite defenseobjections that the government had not demonstrated sufficientlythat adequate steps were taken to secure blood drawn in 1986 whenMorris was tested for AIDS.</TEXT></DOC>
