Everything in Ekuk and Chignik, Aleknagik and Igiugig, and theother 26 tiny settlements scattered around Bristol Bay takes on asense of urgency as Aleuts, Indians, Eskimos, and whites preparefor the commercial fishing season.   Mending nets, checking engines, painting hulls _ men, women, andchildren whose entire annual income depends on their success on thesea are now scrambling to be ready for that momentous day when thesalmon run.   ``You forget everything else until after fishing season,'' saidDillingham Mayor Joe McGill, a commercial fisherman in Bristol Baysince 1947. ``That's all that matters. Dillingham goes from asleepy little town to a crazy metropolis.''   The blazing summer Arctic sun now rises higher in the sky,melting the bay's icepack and hundreds of inches of snow on boatsin the storage yard. This town of 1,570 becomes a hub for boatrepair, transportation, and speculation about the season ahead.   Will it be a good one, like the last five, and yield enough tomake boat payments, cancel the winter's grub bill at the grocerystore, leave enough left over for a new refrigerator or even a trip``outside'' to the lower 48 when the thermometer dips to 50-belowzero next January?   The entire region, totaling 44,000 square miles, has a permanentpopulation of about 4,500.   ``In the summer there's a big influx of people from `outside'who come up just to fish and hope they make a killing in a month,''said McGill. ``Forget flying out of here, this becomes the thirdbusiest airport in the state because of fishing _ fishermen comingin, fish being flown out.''   The year's cycle along Bristol Bay depends on the world'srichest red salmon run, which usually begins in mid-June andcontinues at a fever pitch through mid-July before tapering off inlate summer.   More than 3,500 fishing permits, involving about 10,000fishermen, are issued by the state for Bristol Bay.   Robert Heyano holds a permit, now worth more than $250,000. Sodoes his wife Marie, and his mother Rose, and two of his brothers.His parents are the only year-round residents of Ekuk, 14 milessouth of Dillingham, where his father Peter is the cannerycaretaker. In the summer that tiny settlement swells to dozens whocamp out for three months' fishing.   Heyano, like nearly everyone around Bristol Bay following thePrince William Sound oil spill, is adamantly opposed to oil and gasdevelopment in the precious fishing grounds.   ``The whole rhythm of our lives is based on fishing andsubsistence hunting,'' said Heyano, 37. ``If you weren't able to dothat I don't see how anyone could continue to live in a village.The meaning of life would be gone.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Tad Bartimus is the AP Mountain States regionalreporter, based in Denver.</TEXT></DOC>
