Mexican Federal Judicial Police arrested four people, saidsheriff's Lt. George Gavito. Gavito said the suspects were U.S. andMexican citizens, but did not identify them further.   The dead found by the federal police included 21-year-oldUniversity of Texas student Mark Kilroy, who vanished during hisspring break last month while in the Mexican city of Matamoros,Gavito said.   Kilroy apparently was chosen at random by drug smugglers whohoped human sacrifices would protect them from harm, Gavito said.He was taken after the cult members ``were told to pick one Anglomale that particular night,'' the lieutenant said.   The cult had been involved in human sacrifices for about ninemonths, he said, and prayed to the devil ``so the police would notarrest them, so bullets would not kill them and so they could makemore money.''   Authorities found candles and kettles full of body parts andanimal bones, said Oran Neck, chief U.S. Customs agent inBrownsville.   A small color snapshot displayed at the news conference showed acaldron containing a dark, red liquid and what appeared to bebones. Another picture showed 12 body bags.   Authorities would not identify the other victims, but said allwere males.   One grave held three bodies another contained two, said Neck.Some victims were shot in the head, while others appeared to havebeen slain with machetes or sledgehammers, the agent said.   The bodies were found Tuesday morning in a field about 20 mileswest of Matamoros, Gavito said.   ``I've been an investigator 15 years and it's one of the worstthings I've ever seen,'' he said.   Kilroy's brain was missing, said Brownsville Herald photographerAnthony Padilla, who said he saw the body at a Matamoros funeralhome. ``There was nothing inside the skull,'' Padilla said.   In some forms of witchcraft, removal of the brain signifies asacrifice of the victim's soul.   Padilla said Kilroy's legs were cut off at mid-calf and hisspine was severed and twisted.   Kilroy, a pre-medical student, vanished from a crowded Matamorosstreet shortly after 2 a.m. on March 14 while on a drinking foraywith a group of friends in Matamoros, a city of 180,000 just acrossthe Rio Grande from Brownsville.   Law officers on both sides of the border were stumped, with noclues to Kilroy's disappearance despite an intensive search, thequestioning of nearly 100 people and a $15,000 reward.   The 3-foot-deep grave containing Kilroy's body was found afterMexican federal police alerted U.S. officials early Tuesday thatthey had obtained confessions from the suspects, officials said.   At least one of the suspects admitted involvement in Kilroy'sdeath, said Neck.   The student's parents, Helen and James Kilroy of Santa Fe,Texas, arrived in Brownsville on Tuesday following the grislydiscovery.   Gwen Huddleston, the mother of one of the students with Kilroythe night he vanished, took the Kilroys to the airport for the trip.   ``Helen (Kilroy) of course is very upset after finding out thenews that it really was Mark down there,'' she told KTRK-TV inHouston later. ``They went down there in hopes that it wouldn't be,but it didn't turn out that way.''   Authorities refused to talk about the evidence or pinpoint thelocation of the grave. The area was sealed, Gavito said.   The case is being investigated by Customs, the U.S. AttorneyGeneral's Office, Mexican federal authorities and local lawenforcement agencies on both sides of the border.   It was the third drug-related mass killing discovered near theborder in less than three weeks.   On March 29, Mexican authorities found the bodies of three womenand six men on an abandoned ranch near Agua Prieta, Mexico, justacross the border from Douglas, Ariz.   Five were at the bottom of a well and four in an earthen septictank. All nine were bound and had been tortured and mutilated,officials said. Mexican and U.S. investigators said the slayingswere drug-related.   On April 1, the bodies of three more men killed in similarfashion were fished from the well. All were believed to be Mexicannationals.   On March 27, two people from Arizona and three from the Mexicanstate of Sonora were found bound and stabbed in a shed in Tucson.Those deaths were also called drug-related.   Officials said Thursday it was possible the Tucson and the AguaPrieta cases were linked.   Herbal medicine and the use of witch doctors, or ``curanderos,''is common in Mexico. Most markets in Mexico City have stalls whereherbs are sold for cures, to cast or remove good or bad spells orto cleanse a home of evil.   Human sacrifice, common in the country's pre-Columbian Indiancultures, is little known now, but is not unheard of. It is said tobe used occasionally in rituals in which one person is killed aspart of curing another. One such case was reported earlier thisyear in Mexico City.</TEXT></DOC>
