Salwen </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices shook off a sharp drop at the opening bell, then rode dollar-related buying to their fourth consecutive advance of the new year.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 14.09 points to close at 2051.89 after declining 27 points in the first 15 minutes of trading. Volume stayed modest, totaling 175.4 million shares yesterday compared with Wednesday's 169.7 million shares. Advancers continued to outpace losers, 946 to 611.    &quot;I really think the market's acting very well,&quot; said Sid Dorr, vice president, equity trading, at Robinson Humphrey in Atlanta. &quot;The onus right now is on the bears to see what kind of effect they can have on the market. But they can't seem to muster up any kind of momentum for a sell-off.&quot;    Traders said stocks turned around late in the afternoon after Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said he expects to see a sharp improvement in the trade-deficit figures to be released next Friday. The dollar rallied on the news, as did stock prices.    Jack Baker, the head of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s block trading desk, said he expects yesterday afternoon's momentum in the dollar and stock prices to carry over into this morning. &quot;The selling has definitely abated,&quot; he said. &quot;We're still in a constructive mode.&quot;    Mr. Baker said yesterday morning's decline was caused by a combination of program selling and a number of buyers moving to the sidelines to gauge the market's early activity. &quot;We didn't see real aggressive selling (yesterday) morning, just a pullback of buyers,&quot; he said.    Lon Gorman, vice president and senior trader at First Boston Corp., said investors are encouraged by a couple of recent takeover-related moves. Those moves are changing investors' methods for valuing not only the target stocks, but also many of those in the industry group. He cited Hoffmann La Roche's acquisition bid for Sterling Drug. &quot;What that does, which I haven't heard since October, is bring valuations of stocks to different levels,&quot; he said. &quot;We're now looking at break-up valuations.&quot;    Mr. Gorman also said Wall Street was watching closely the takeover overtures from E-II Holdings for American Brands. &quot;These two moves, although seemingly not major corporations, are the first time the Street has seen some action along these lines since the crash,&quot; he explained.    Robinson's Mr. Dorr said a paucity of stock is helping to boost share prices in the new year. &quot;The amount of stock buybacks since the crash has really dwindled the supply of stocks that's around,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a pure supply-and-demand thing. The dollar's definitely a major factor but to me the market was going to do well no matter what.&quot;    Fred Lange, president of Lange Financial Services, New York, noted that the industrial index slipped to the 2010 level, but found enough support there to rebound. He contended that 2010 is significant because it had created a resistance level on the way up. &quot;The resistance level has now become a level of support,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it's very healthy.&quot;    Mr. Lange added that the weak volume of the past two trading days is important to a continued rally. &quot;We were looking for some sort of pullback,&quot; he said. &quot;Once this dries up on the downside, another rally is just around the corner.&quot;    First Boston's Mr. Gorman concurred. &quot;I'm fairly confident in the market's performance over the short-term,&quot; he said. &quot;I think there might be another couple hundred points on the upside here before we see a significant decline.&quot;    Mr. Gorman added the caution, however, that stock prices &quot;may move sideways&quot; over the next week or so until the trade numbers are released next Friday.    Shearson's Mr. Baker noted that the Dow Jones Utilities Average has outpaced the industrial and transportation indexes. &quot;People must believe that interest rates are going to go lower,&quot; he said. &quot;That's another signal on the positive side of the equation.&quot;    Retailing stocks were extremely active following the release of December sales figures. Dayton Hudson led the group, jumping 2 3/8 to 33 1/2 after reporting a 19% sales increase; Woolworth, which posted a 14% sales rise, gained 1 to 38 1/2; Federated Department Stores rose 3/4 to 37; and May Department Stores increased 1 1/2 to 33 3/8.    The industry's big disappointment was J.C. Penney, which posted an 8.6% increase in sales for the Christmas month but said profit was flat for the period. &quot;They were very aggressive in taking markdowns,&quot; said Jeffrey Edelman, a retailing analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. &quot;It just took its toll on earnings.&quot;    Penney plummeted 3 1/8 to 43 1/2 on trading of 2.3 million shares. The stocks of two other big retailers, Sears and Wal-Mart, also declined after announcing December results; K mart stock closed unchanged at 32.    Auto stocks were also extremely active; several traders said they heard speculation that Chrysler was considering a leveraged buyout. Chrysler jumped 1 1/2 to 26 3/4 on trading of more than 2.3 million shares. Ford Motor added 1 1/2 to 82 1/4, and General Motors soared 2 to 66 1/4.    Oil stocks were strong despite yesterday's slip in most oil prices. Traders said the activity came from the prolonged climb in oil prices and from the recent cold wave across most of the U.S. Exxon gained 3/4 to 41 1/8; Mobil jumped 1 1/2 to 42 1/4; Chevron added 1 to 44; Amoco rose 1 1/4 to 74; Atlantic Richfield increased 2 1/4 to 75 1/4; and Texaco added 1 to 38 7/8.    Gillette added to Wednesday's gains, jumping a further 1 1/2 to 35; Wall Street sources said Coniston Partners has accumulated a stake in the company. Coniston declined to comment on the rumors.    Among other big movers, MCA stock jumped 2 3/4 to 38 3/4; General Mills soared 1 7/8 to 52 1/4 after the company said it has hired Dillon, Read andamp; Co. to help sell its Eddie Bauer and Talbots subsidiaries. </TEXT></DOC>
