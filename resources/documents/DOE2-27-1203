It is shown that in order to have a naturallysmall neutrino mass, the left-right mixing has also to be sufficientlysmall, independently of the structure of the Higgs sector. As a result,contributions to the neutrino magnetic moment due to the left-right mixingcannot be much larger than 3x10/sup -19/ (m/sub {nu}c//eV)(e/2m/sub e/).</TEXT></DOC>
