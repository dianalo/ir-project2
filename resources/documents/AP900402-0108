DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Bush administration said Monday it'sgetting very serious about energy conservation and environmentalissues it suggested were given short shrift under President Reagan.   Secretary of Energy James D. Watkins made the assessment as hereleased an interim report on an energy strategy his departmentplans to submit to President Bush in December.   The 230-page report summarized views expressed in 12,000 pagesof testimony taken at 15 public hearings that began in August.   ``The hardest choices lie ahead,'' Watkins said. ``If we canfinish a product that will make everybody equally unhappy, we willhave done our job.''   The report draws no conclusions, but presents an array ofpossibilities and lists potential obstacles, including objectionsof industry groups.   ``The loudest single message was to increase energy efficiencyin every sector of energy use,'' Watkins said. ``Energy efficiencywas seen as a way to reduce pollution, reduce dependence on oilimports and reduce the cost of energy.''   In response to a question, Watkins said environmental concernswould be a significant factor in shaping the final report.   `I don't think the department has been that forthcoming in thoseareas in the past and we are getting very serious about it at thedirection of the president,'' he said.   The report calls for examination of strict conservationrequirements and government-financed development of renewablealternative energy sources such as hydroelectric dams andgeothermal power.   Reagan stoutly opposed such measures, arguing that energy issuesshould be left to the marketplace. He even advocated doing awaywith the Energy Department.   Bush, in asking for the energy strategy said, ``A keystone ofthis strategy is going to be the continuation of the successfulpolicy of market reliance.''   The report nevertheless lists scores of ideas calling for a moreactive government role, including industry regulation.   Among them:   _New or heightened government efforts to find new energysources, including solar, nuclear fusion, safer and cheaper nuclearfission, and alternative fuels such as liquefied natural gas,methanol and ethanol for automobiles.   _More demanding government fuel efficiency standards forautomobiles, requiring the manufacture of more compact vehicles.   _Higher efficiency standards for appliances and other electricaldevices, including home and office lights.   _A return to energy-oriented tax breaks, ranging from specialallowances for domestic oil explorers to new incentives forhomeowners to install better insulation and solar heating systems.   The interim report said reliance on foreign oil continues tosoar despite remarkable strides in efficency since the oil crisesof the 1970s.   Watkins said the best estimate is that U.S. energy efficiencycould be increased by 10 percent to 12 percent by early in the nextcentury if present policies are followed. He said the departmentbelieves that can be doubled by following some of the stepsoutlined in the report.</TEXT></DOC>
