This article includes two cases of acute myelocyticleukemia in individuals with a long history of exposure to asbestos.Significant numbers of asbestos bodies were detected in specimens oftheir lungs and bone marrow. In addition, the kind of asbestos in bothorgans was crocidolite, which is implicated in carcinogenesis. No asbestosbodies were detected in the bone marrow specimens from a control groupconsisting of ten patients with lung cancer with similar occupationalhistories. The role of asbestos exposure in the development of leukemiarequires further study.</TEXT></DOC>
