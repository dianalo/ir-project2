Mr. Poitras said the stretched version of the Challenger, a twin-engine executive jet, would accommodate as many as 48 passengers and probably would be used in commuter operations or small cargo transport operations.    Mr. Poitras said after an analysts meeting that Montreal-based Bombardier, a maker of transportation equipment, estimates the total market for this type of aircraft at about 1,500 units over a 10-year period from the date of introduction. He said Bombardier expects to win a 30% to 35% share of this market, with sales of about 500 units over the same period.    He said this would represent revenue of about US$7 billion to Bombardier over the 10-year period, or about US$700 million annually. He said the figures are based on a price per unit of US$14 million.    Mr. Poitras said Bombardier believes it could develop the stretched Challenger for introduction by 1992. </TEXT></DOC>
