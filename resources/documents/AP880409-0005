From a plateau of about $50 billion a year from 1981 to 1984,global arms imports declined to $42 billion in 1985 and $34 billionin 1986, according to a report issued Friday by the U.S. ArmsControl and Disarmament Agency.   ``As late as 1984, the trend in arms imports by developingnations was sharply up in almost all years, fueled by ambitiousforce improvement programs financed in most cases by rising oilprices and easy credit,'' the agency said.   Since then, an oil glut has driven down Mideast income and theThird World's debt problems have made funds for weapons scarce.Besides, many of the countries that bought all those weapons in theearly 1980s have all the guns, tanks, planes and ammunition theywant, the report said.   ``A sharp decline in Middle East arms imports in 1985 and 1986was the main contributor to the decline in the world anddeveloping-country totals,'' the agency said. ``From their peak in1984, Middle East imports dropped an average of 24 percent in 1985and 1986.''   Despite the drop in arms imports, global military spending rosein 1986 to $921 billion from $800 billion the previous year.   During 1985, the last year covered by the country-by-countryarms transfer figures, Iraq topped the list of weapons importers,buying $4 billion worth of equipment for the war against Iran thatbegan in 1980.   Iraq was followed in order by Saudi Arabia, India, Cuba, WestGermany, Iran, Libya, Syria, Egypt and the Soviet Union, whichpurchases large amounts of weaponry from its allies in EasternEurope.   The United States, which is being urged by its NATO partners tobuy more weapons from Western Europe, ranked 23rd on the list ofimporting nations, with $600 million worth of purchases.   As it has for many years, the Soviet Union led the list ofinternational arms sellers. Its transfers totalled $15.3 billion.The United States was second with $12.3 billion, followed byFrance, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Italy, Britain, West Germany, Chinaand East Germany.   The variety and quality of Soviet and U.S. weapons and thesuperpowers' willingness to employ weapons sales ``as a politicalinstrument, suggest that the two will remain the Third World'slargest suppliers by significant margins for many years to come,''the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
