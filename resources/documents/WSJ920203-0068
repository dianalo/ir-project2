In a review of regulatory programs run by 20 states,Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, the department'sOccupational Safety and Health Administration found variousviolations of federal requirements. These included failure toadopt federal standards in a timely fashion, to imposeadequate fines and to conduct sufficient safety or healthinspections, among other shortcomings.</LP><TEXT>   OSHA allows the states and territories to run their ownprograms, provided they match federal requirements. OSHAregulates worker health and safety directly in other states.   The review was an outgrowth of a fire in September at anImperial Food Products poultry plant in Hamlet, N.C., inwhich 25 workers died, trapped behind doors locked from theoutside. OSHA already has taken over part of North Carolina'sprogram, and Labor Secretary Lynn Martin in early Januarygave the state 90 days to correct its regulatory shortcomingsor see OSHA take over the rest.   The other states' workplace regulation isn't as bad asNorth Carolina's, acting OSHA chief Dorothy Strunk indicated.She said most of their deficiencies aren't &quot;serious.&quot; WhileNorth Carolina was deficient in 18 of 36 criteria evaluatedby OSHA, deficiencies in other jurisdictions ranged up to 15,for Wyoming.   In addition, Mrs. Strunk said, &quot;I am encouraged by thecooperative spirit show by these 22 states {and territories}. . . and by the fact that many states already have begun toaddress problems we found.&quot;   Those states were given until March 1 to submit atimetable and plan of action for ending deficiencies. If anyof them fail to make substantial improvements in theirprograms in six months, they face possible OSHA takeover oftheir programs, too, Mrs. Strunk said.   Where legislative action is necessary, states will have amaximum of two legislative years to change their laws. Statesare already under a federal mandate to boost fines sevenfoldfor violation of worker safety and health rules this year, tomatch a similar jump set recently by Congress for OSHA fines.   The state review concentrated especially on whether statesadopt comparable standards within six months after federalstandards take effect, have adequate staffing, have enactedthe sevenfold penalty increase, have adequate systems forassuring that hazards are abated and have means to assurethat government inspectors can enter workplaces.   States were checked, in particular, to see if they haveadopted standards to match five recent federal standards.These include regulations covering construction excavations,exposure to hazardous substances in laboratories, electricalsafety, so-called lift-slab building construction and use ofstairways and ladders in construction.   In addition to Wyoming and the two territories, stateswhose programs were reviewed were Alaska, Arizona,California, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland,Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, SouthCarolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
