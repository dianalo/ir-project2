Karr   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>06/27/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), NO PAGE CITATION</SO><LP>   WASHINGTON -- Many top executives blame the laggingquality of American goods and services on a lack ofcommitment from workers rather than on themselves, accordingto a new poll.   Philip Crosby Associates Inc., a Winter Park, Fla.,consulting firm that specializes in workplace-quality issues,released a Gallup poll showing that chief executive officersacknowledge America's problems with quality. But theconsulting firm said that executives are wrongly denyingtheir own responsibility for the problem.</LP><TEXT>   According to the Gallup survey of 401 chief executiveofficers of U.S. companies, 62% said lack of managerialattention doesn't affect quality, 70% said pressure forshort-term profits isn't a quality problem and 20% admit thatmanufacturing speedups hamper quality. Almost 300 of thechief executives run companies with sales of more than $75million a year, said George Gallup, the pollster'sco-chairman.   Lance Arrington, president of Philip Crosby, said it'sgood that U.S. top executives are no longer reluctant toadmit that foreign competitors are doing a better-quality jobthan they are. But he warned, &quot;When executives look only tothe work force, only to those people who discover the defect. . . they are ignoring the fact that the real problem mostlikely rests somewhere back up the line, perhaps too close tosenior management decisions for comfort.&quot; Mr. Arrington, aformer ITT Corp. executive, said he and his firm havecounseled many U.S. and foreign companies on qualitytraining.   Contrary to the views expressed in the Gallup poll, lackof management attention, a drive for short-term profits andmanufacturing-speed demands have a crucial negative effect onquality, Mr. Arrington said.   While most executives don't seem to realize it, &quot;{quality}is often impaired by all of these three pressures asignificant portion of the time,&quot; Mr. Arrington said.   Mr. Arrington's views tend to jibe with the conclusions ofthe Commission on Skills of the Workplace, a 35-member groupformed by a former unit of Carnegie Corp. The commission lastweek issued a report saying, in part, that corporatemanagement needs to reorganize the workplace in ways thatgive workers more authority, while training them better, toimprove product quality and productivity.   The Gallup survey confirms &quot;the overwhelming need formanagement to educate, train and instill a commitment toquality . . . from the executive suite to the productionfloor,&quot; Mr. Arrington said. He estimated that as much as 40%of companies' service-oriented effort is wasted because itinvolves correcting poor-quality work or planning forexpected defects.   Nearly half of the poll respondents who havequality-improvement programs developed them in the past fouryears, but too many of them use &quot;less than effective&quot;methods, the consultant said.</TEXT></DOC>
