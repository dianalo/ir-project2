For one, it meant that Alberta entered the major league of worldoil producers. The discoveries of the Leduc and Redwater fields in thelater 1940s spurred production in Alberta to some 10 million cubic metresin 1951, nearly eight times the levels of 1946. Leduc also intitiateda long, sustained period of population growth in Alberta. Another impactwas Alberta's rise as a mineral exporting province. The provincial governmentalso developed the regulatory infrastructure which would govern the growthand development of the petroleum industry, in particular the unique institutionestablished in 1938, the Oil and Gas Conservation Board, later renamedthe Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board. Another major venturewhich mixed private and public intiatives was the Syncrude project onthe Athabasca tarsands. Yet another field of slow but steady interestin the 1950s and 1960s was the Canadian north. The cumulative effectsby 1971 of the petroleum industry on Alberta were impressive. The themewhich emerges in the 1980s is one of consolidation in the face of politicalconflict and uncertain world prices.</TEXT></DOC>
