Sillin accurately describes the energy situationin the non-transportation sector (&quot;The Nuclear EnergyWeapon,&quot; editorial page, Aug. 23). But this nation rolls onoil. Practically everything we move is powered by gasoline,diesel fuel and jet-engine fuel.   Los Angeles has decreed major changes in auto and truckfuel over the next 10 to 20 years. The solutions includealcohol from grain that will demand fertilizers from naturalgas, methanol from natural gas and electric-powered cars.</LP><TEXT>   It would be ironic if the electric cars now beingdeveloped go into production and we end up charging theirbatteries with electricity generated by burning oil and gasin power plants. Nuclear plants are base-loaded; they alreadyserve current demand day and night. Utilities meet additionaldaytime loads with hydro, coal and natural gas.   All available hydroenergy is used each season, and thatmeans that even if all batteries are charged at night, morecoal, gas and even oil will have to be burned for electricitygeneration. Society is willing to give up some energyefficiency to reduce urban smog and to save limited resourcesof oil and gas. But it does not make sense to miss both ofthose objectives while uranium and a good technology toutilize it sit waiting for public understanding.   A. David Rossin   Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy   U.S. Department of Energy, 1986-87   Chicago   ---   Between the dangers of global warming and imminent war inthe Mideast, our need for non-polluting energy independencehas never been more obvious. Yet, a march down the path tonuclear power, as Mr. Sillin encourages, is like walkingblindfolded. No one, in or outside the nuclear industry, hasproposed a safe treatment for nuclear waste. These wasteproducts will remain insidiously damaging to most forms oflife for thousands of years. If Mr. Sillin shortchanges ouringenuity and industriousness in developing solar, biomass orother renewable forms of energy to a commercially viablelevel, does he really think we can build containment vesselsthat will last for a few thousand years?   In the area of transportation, we already have thetechnological solution: Hydrogen burns cleanly and can beused by existing vehicles with minor engine modifications anda different storage tank. If it were mass produced, usingsolar energy to convert water or biomass, its price would becomparable with the pre-Persian Gulf conflict gasoline pricelevels. We would eliminate the threat of global warming, oilspills, toxic storage leaks and at least one trigger forarmed conflict.   Harry Mishkin   Scottsdale, Ariz.   ---   The American Nuclear Society believes that the U.S.government should heed Mr. Sillin's warnings. We areconcerned that the Department of Energy's National EnergyStrategy (NES) is taking shape slowly, and may not fullyreflect the critical importance of new base-loadelectric-generating plants in our nation's energy future.   The NES should characterize the risks of all of ourelectricity-supply options, including the strategic risks offalling back on more imported oil. It should also clearlyconsider the risks to our nation ofelectric-generating-capacity shortages. We have had regionalbrownouts and rolling blackouts this year. These are warningsignals that we will need new capacity soon, yet nothing muchis being ordered.   Undoubtedly, the nation will conserve and use electricitymore efficiently. Nevertheless, we will still need additionalcapacity if our expectations for the future and our desiresto clean up our environment are to be realized. We cannotmeet demand and replace older, less-efficient, power plants,and those that may be shut down as a result of the new CleanAir bill without new base-load power plants.   This will require action at the federal level onstandardized nuclear-plant licenses, and action by Congressto ensure regulation that is stable, predictable and has asound technical basis.   Moreover, we need to stop pretending that there areunsolvable scientific issues that prevent real progress onnuclearwaste disposal. We need to remove this importantnational obligation from state and local politics.Radioactive wastes already exist, and must be disposed ofsafely and permanently, even if every nuclear plant in theworld were shut down tomorrow. Obviously, if we can safelydispose of the wastes that already exist, handling futurewastes will be no different.   M.J. Ohanian   President   American Nuclear Society   La Grange Park, Ill.   ---   Mr. Sillin has raised false hopes by concluding that morenuclear-power plants can help us &quot;to deal with thugs likeSaddam Hussein&quot; who threaten our oil supply.   Generation of electricity is hardly a significant factoranymore in our dependence on foreign oil. The U.S. generatedonly 5% of its electricity from oil in 1986 through 1988,down from 17% in 1973, according to Edison Electric Institutedata. This current usage in turn represents only 4% of thetotal petroleum used in the same current period, again downfrom 9% in 1973. Transportation is the big culprit, consuming63% of the total. This is followed by industrial use,including chemical feedstocks, at 25%. Residential andcommercial users account for the remaining 8%.   Nuclear power is an important future resource, and thepublic deserves a clear and objective picture of the role itshould play in the U.S. energy picture. This understanding isnot served by an attempt to justify it as a response to anirrational world leader like Saddam Hussein.   George C. Ford   President   George C.
