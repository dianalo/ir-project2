(7,8-/sup3/H) dopamine is an important tracer for the study of physiological functionsand metabolic processes. It was prepared by catalytic reduction of 3-hydroxy-4-methoxy-8-nitro-styrenewith tritium gas. At the end of reaction, hydrobromic acid was addedand heated to remove the methoxyl group. The crude product was purifiedby paper chromatography. The purity of (7,8-/sup 3/H) dopamine was identifiedby IR, UV, PC and /sup 3/H-NMR spectra. The radiochemical purity wasover 95% and the specific activity was 1.26 x 10/sup 12/ Bq/mmol (34Ci/mmol). The distribution of labelled tritium in molecule was shownas follows: 55.4% at position 7 and 44.6% at position 8.</TEXT></DOC>
