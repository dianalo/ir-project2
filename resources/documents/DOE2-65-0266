The rates are evaluated for monoenergetic, thermaland power-law pair distributions and are compared with existing ultrarelativisticquantum results and also with previous work in the mildly relativisticclassical regime. The fully quantum treatment presented yields ratesthat are considerably lower than is predicted by classical or ultrarelativisticquantum calculations. The relatively compact results derived in thispaper find direct application in the theory of pulsars and {gamma}-rayburst sources in strong magnetic fields.</TEXT></DOC>
