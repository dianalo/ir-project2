Lawmakers were anxious to end the public outcry against the$45,500 increase, which left them feeling, in the words of onerepresentative, like ``cannon fodder for trash television and talkradio.''   First, the House voted to reject the raise by a vote of 380-48.Less than three hours later, the Senate followed suit by a vote of94-6.   The raise would have become law at midnight without Bush'ssignature on the resolution rejecting it. Bush had supported theraise but went along with Congress, signing the measure hours afterthe congressional votes.   The votes also denied large raises for top federal executives andfederal judges. The Constitution forbids judicial raises from beingscaled back once they have taken effect.   Bush had supported the pay raise and said in a statement Tuesdaynight that ``I believe some level of pay increase is in order and Iwill be working with the House and Senate leadership to developproposals to achieve that end.'' He cited a ``special concern''about judges' pay.   Some lawmakers predicted that defeating the raises wouldaccelerate an exodus of judges and federal managers from governmentservice.   Indeed, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said in a statement:   ``I deeply regret the congressional action, which has preventedthe federal judges in this country from receiving a well-deservedpay raise. ... We will not be able to attract and retain the kind ofjudges we need ... unless we pay our judges fairly and equitably.''   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said Bush told SenateRepublicans Tuesday he might ask Congress to approve lesser raisesfor the judges and executives.   With its votes, Congress rejected raises proposed by apresidential commission and endorsed by then-President Reagan.Senators and representatives would have seen their salaries risefrom $89,500 to $135,000.   During its less than 30 minutes of debate, the Senate heard JesseHelms, R-N.C. and a foe of the raise, proclaim that the vote showsthe American people that ``you can fight city hall and you can takeon the Congress of the United States with all its legerdemain andall its legislative ability.''   The Senate last week voted 95-5 against the raise, but thewording of that resolution differed from the House version approvedTuesday. Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., who had voted against theraise, voted for it Tuesday.   Jeffords said he cast his vote Tuesday to make clear his viewthat judges are badly in need of a pay raise and because, unlikelast week's measure, this one did not curtail lawmakers' rights tomake speeches for fees.   The other senators voting to sustain the raise were DemocratsChristopher Dodd of Connecticut, Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts andSpark Matsunaga of Hawaii; and Republicans Frank Murkowski of Alaskaand Ted Stevens of Alaska.   Despite the overwhelming House margin, members were clearly tornbetween their desire for a pay raise and the public scorn heapedupon them for considering the increase.   The chamber applauded loudly when Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.,told colleagues in a rousing speech before the vote, ``Each memberof this House, Democrat and Republican, is worth a salary of$135,000 a year.''   The irony of the House's dilemma was reflected when Rep. VicFazio, D-Calif., a pay raise defender, introduced the resolution toreject the increase _ but voted against the resolution.   ``We face reality here today,'' Fazio said. ``We're doing whathas become inevitable.''   Fazio chided his colleagues for not having ``the courage to speakout'' in their own defense and said, ``We became cartoon cannonfodder for trash television and talk radio.'' He added, ``There areSupreme Court justices who make less than their clerks the day afterthey (the clerks) retire and go into private practice.''   Left dangling by Congress' action were ethics reforms thatlawmakers had hoped to pass once the raise became law.   These included a ban on fees for speeches and appearances in bothhouses. A bipartisan House negotiating group also had agreed to doaway in 1991 with a legal loophole that allowed 190 House members _those in office before 1980 _ to accumulate $39 million in leftovercampaign cash, which can be converted to personal use.   ``This issue isn't over,'' said Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, a leadingopponent of the pay raise who said the Congress must deal this yearwith pay for judges and bureaucrats as well as the questionsinvolved in honoraria and other forms of outside income forlawmakers.   Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif. and one of those who negotiated thepackage of reforms, said he's ``never seen a legislative body thatwas anything but clumsy in dealing with levels of pay.''   But he added that in rejecting the raise, the House ``will bereflecting the voices of the people regarding their attitude towardcongressional pay.''   Raise opponents cleared the path for rejection votes in bothhouses Monday after they engineered the collapse of House SpeakerJim Wright's suggested alternative for a 30 percent pay increase.   The speaker planned to let the full raise become law at 12:01a.m. Wednesday and then schedule a Thursday vote to scale back theincrease to 30 percent. Coupled with the planned honoraria ban, theraise of $26,850 would have amounted to a dollar-for-dollar tradefor those earning the fee limit.   Besides the raise for members of Congress, the presidentialcommission had proposed:   _Increasing the president's pay from $200,000 to $350,000 and thevice president's from $115,000 to $175,000. The raises would nothave affected President Bush or Vice President Dan Quayle.   _Raising the salaries of top federal officials, now in the rangeof $75,000 to $99,500, to a range of $115,000 to $155,000.   _Hiking the salary of the chief justice from $115,000 to $175,000and the salaries of associate justices of the Supreme Court from$110,000 to $165,000.   _Raising the pay of federal appellate judges from $95,000 to$140,000 and that of federal district judges from $89,500 to$135,000.   Retired congressmen, presidents, vice presidents, top federalofficials and federal judges would also have received higherpensions under the commission's proposal.</TEXT></DOC>
