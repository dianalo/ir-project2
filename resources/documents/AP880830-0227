COLEMAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Roy S. Roberts rode a rising star through GeneralMotors Corp., flying through management ranks in an 11-year stintthat he ended as the highest-ranking black officer at the dowagerof American manufacturing.   He resigned Aug. 1 with his star still rising to take over the$3 billion truck division at Navistar International Corp. with thejob of making a good operation better.   Roberts, 49, is bringing to North America's leading maker ofmedium- and heavy-duty trucks his reputation as ``a very dynamicleader, accepted within all ranks,'' said spokesman John D.McDonald.   ``We're happy to have him,'' McDonald said of Roberts, whojoined Navistar Aug. 8. ``He has a strong background inmanufacturing, and certainly with ... people. He has some verystrong leadership capabilities and a competitive spirit.''   Navistar declined to make Roberts available for comment, ``untilhe gets ... his feet on the ground,'' said spokesman Bill Greenhill.   As he departed, Roberts got an official blessing from GM.   ``Roy Roberts has been a valued executive and an outstandingcontributor in every assignment throughout his General Motorscareer,'' said Roger B. Smith, GM chairman and chief executiveofficer. ``We wish him the best in his new position at Navistar.''   With $4 billion in annual sales, Navistar is enjoying its thirdstraight profitable year, after six money-losers stemming fromrecession, labor troubles and the farm crisis of the early 1980s.   The company's truck division is the leader in North America, andRoberts' job will be ``to expand or strengthen that leadershipposition,'' McDonald said. ``He is not taking over in a `back'position.''   Navistar plucked Roberts from possible contention as GM's firstminority chief operating officer, luring him with cash and stockvalued at about $400,000, plus an annual salary estimated at nearly$440,000, McDonald ackowledged.   Roberts, who was vice president of personnel administration anddevelopment for GM, is in charge of engineering, manufacturing andmarketing of medium- and heavy-duty trucks for Navistar, formerlyInternational Harvester.   His record for inspiring loyalty among employees while keepingoperations competitive is among his chief assets, McDonald said.   Roberts faced perhaps his greatest challenge at GM when he hadto lay off 40,000 white-collar workers, 25 percent of the company'ssalaried employees.   ``If anyone thinks it's fun to ask anyone to leave GeneralMotors, it's not fun. It's not fun,'' Roberts told USA Todayrecently.   It was employee loyalty to Roberts that caught the eye of asuperior and served as a catalyst to his meteoric rise, accordingto a recent interview in the Chicago Tribune.   Elmer Johnson, then a GM executive vice president, said he wasinspecting the plant that Roberts managed in Tarrytown, N.Y., whenRoberts introduced him to about 70 employees, the newspaperreported.   ``I looked at the faces of the employees as he spoke, and youcould tell that they loved him and that they loved working forhim,'' Johnson was quoted as saying.   At Tarrytown, Roberts is credited with saving the plant fromshutdown by winning the nod to build GM's plastic-body minivan.   ``He's a very inspirational man, full of warmth and humor. I wasmoved by his abilities,'' said Johnson, who remembered Roberts ayear later when the post of vice president of personnel fell vacant.   John E. Jacob, president of the National Urban League, saidRoberts ``is the ideal role model for young people of all races.Not only has he shown steady growth throughout his career, he hasevidenced that hard work has its rewards.   ``He has further shown that one can be aggressive and committedto civil rights and still succeed in corporate America,'' Jacobsaid in a recent statement, noting that Roberts has maintained anactive involvement in the Urban League and NAACP.   At the Urban League's national conference in Detroit earlierthis month, Roberts gave two talks, including one on the importanceof education.   ``He's also one of the nicest people you'll ever want to meet,''said Urban League spokeswoman Janet Dewart.   One of 10 children born to a family in Magnolia, Ark., Roberts'mother died when he was 2 and his father moved the family toMichigan, where Roberts began his career on the factory floor atGrand Rapids auto parts supplier Lear Siegler Inc. in 1959.   He worked nights so he could go to school and earn a businessadministration degree while also supporting a family.   Roberts joined GM as director of education and training at thediesel equipment division in 1977, took over Tarrytown in 1985 andbecame vice president in 1987, skipping half a dozen managementlevels.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Friday Sept. 2</NOTE></DOC>
