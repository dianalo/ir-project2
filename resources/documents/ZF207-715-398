Under GEM, install the HP PaintJet.andO;Next, copy the resulting PDHPJ9.ELQ driver from the GEMAPPS\GEMSYS directoryto the VENTURA directory.andP;  Copy all fonts with .ELQ extensions from theGEMAPPS\FONTS directory.andM;Now turn to the Xerox 4020 color printer driver, available in Ventura.andP;  Toget the necessary font width table, do a deviceonly install and select theXerox 4020 as the output device.andM;From within Ventura's Options, Set Printer Info menu, the HP PaintJet wdi nowappear as an output option.andP;  Select it and change the font width table toXRX402O.WID.andM;To see what Ventura can do with the HP PaintJet, load the CAPABILI.CHPexample file, make it colorful, and go print.andP;  Reverse text, tilted graphics,mixed font orientations, and, of course, color are all available!andM;TIP 3: Using Ventura is a great way to improve the appearance of generaloffice correspondence.andP;  The program can even be used to perfoff n mail-mergefunctions.andP;  The process is often just as fast as conventional methods, yet itproduces documents with a superior professional appearance.andM;Here are instructions for creating chapters that will print a list of namesto number 10 envelopes on a laser printer and, in a variation on that method,will merge the names in the list with form leaers.andP;  Once you understand thebasics of both operations, you can easily customize style sheets and chaptersto accommodate theandM;requirements at your office,andM;A.andP;  List printing to envelopes.andP;  The crucial factor in using this techniqueis that each record in the list must be a separate paragraph.andP;  This means aline break is used to end each line within the name/address record and asingle return is inserted at the end of the record.andP;  You can create this kindof list using your word processor or follow the instructions in Tip 7 togenerate one from your database.andM;In Ventura, a list of this type automatically manages variable record lengthsand creates a new page for each envelope.andP;  Time and effort are conserved byusing Body Text as the basis of formatting each record; this way, tagging isunnecessary.andM;(1) Create a new chapter.andP;  (2) Go to the Chapter/Page Layout menu and changethe Page Orientation to Landscape; select Single for page sides.andP;  (3) Makethe following modifications:andM;* Body Text:andM;Font: For this example, use Swiss, 12 pt.andP;  , bold Spacing: Above: 0 Below: 0Interline: .194 In From Lfft: 6.75 In From Right: 0 Breaks: New Page: After *Set the Underlying Page/Frame with the following margins:andM;Top: 4.00 Bottom: 0 Left: 0 Right: 0 * For added design, make a repeatingframe to border each address:andM;Sizing and Scaling: Flow Text Around: Off Upper Left X: 6.37 Upper Left Y:3.98 Frame Width: 2.62 (wider if necessary) Frame Height: 1.07 (taller ifnecessary) Ruling Box Around: Height of Rule 1: .010 Now just load the textfile into the underlying Page/Frame.andP;  You can further enhance blank envelopesby placing your return address and company logo in repeating frames.andP;  (TurnFlow Text Around off for all repeating frames.)andM;B.andP;  Merging a list with a form letter.andP;  For form letters, position thename/address records as in the example above, but decrease the top margin ofthe underlying Page/Frame and the spacing in from the left for the Body Text.andO;Load the form letter into a large repeating frame just below the point wherethe addresses end.andM;The date, company logo, and address information can all be included andplaced into repeating frames.andP;  For large mailings, write your signature in apaint program, save the file, and load it into a repeating frame at thecorrect position in the form letter.andP;  (There is a limit of six repeatingframes per chapter, so be sure to use them judiciously.) TIP 4: Choose a typeshop experienced with Ventura files.andP;  Though this may seem obvious, it is animportant factor that is sometimes overlooked.andM;The Linotronic-series machines are probably the most common typesettingdevices; they use the popular PostScript page description language, whichoffers perhaps the greatest ease and flexibility for accommodating Venturafiles.andP;  But unlike your PostScript laser printer, which probably has dozensof typefaces built in, a type house must purchase and download these fonts.andM;Any type house owning a PostScript device is likely to own the entire AdobeFont Library as well.andP;  But it is always a good idea to confirm this, alongwith other information, in advance.andM;Here is a useful checklist for selecting a type shop:andM;* Does it handle Ventura files? * What typesetter does it use? Is it aPostScript device?andM;* Does it own the same fonts you'll be using?andM;a How does the shop want the files prepared:andM;b.andP;  Printed to file (using the print-to-file option that outputs chapterfiles in ASCII format)?andM;b.andP;  Printed directly as Ventura chapter files?andM;* What diskette formats can it read? * What is its normal tum-around time andcost per page? (This varies with the resolution-435, 1,270, or 2,540 dpi-sobe specific.) What is the rush charge?andM;* Are there different charges for film, plate, or repro positives andnegatives?andM;* What printer-width table should you use? Does the shop supply any specialones? (Some Compugraphic typehouses will provide special printer width tablesif they're using The Computer Group's Typesetter's Connection, which allowsthe Compugraphic to be selected as a direct output device.)andM;TIP 5 : When spot-color printing, disable unused colors.andP;  The primary reasonfor using spot-color output is to reduce prepress setup charges that wouldotherwise be incurred when the print shop prepares color separations.andP;  Butopting for spot color can actually waste money if files sent to the type shopcontain overlays of unused colors.andP;  A two-color job, for instance, will printfive additional overlays per page if all colors are enabled.andP;  If these go tofilm, you can calculate the damage at an average cost of $10 to $20 pertypeset page.andM;You disable colors through Ventura's Paragaph/Define Colors menu.andP;  For eachunused color in the list, change the Color Seaing to Disable.andP;  Black cannotbe selected or modified; it will print regardless of its use in the chapter.andO;To avoid paying for each unused black overlay, treat a color as &quot;black&quot;throughout die chapter.andM;For example, if you want the final output to make use of yellow and red only,disable one of those colors.andP;  If you disable red, change all instances of redin the chapter to black before sending the files to the type shop.andP;  Ofcourse, this produces black and yellow overlays, but remember that both areactually set in black.andP;  If enough printable areas remain around theperimeter, the color names black and yellow appear.andP;  When you send theoverlays out to the print shop, you'll want to prevent confusion by whitingout the color name &quot;black,&quot; or pasting over it the &quot;red.&quot;andM;TIP 6: To reduce the size of files printed to disk, specify fonts asResident.andM;When using downloaded PostScript fonts, change their Style status to Residentin preparation for printing a chapter file to disk for typeset output.andP;  (Ifyour type shop does not own the same fonts, you'll have to leave their statusas Download.) Often, the information that makes up publications likefinancial reports, research summaries, catalogs, office correspondence, andtechnical documentation originates in applications apart from wordprocessors.andP;  You need to know the most efficient way to extract data fromspreadsheets, databases, and graph and charting applications.andP;  The followingtips will help you optimize integration and increase productivity in youroffice.andM;TIP 7 : You can use your database to generate a label file for Venturamailmerging.andP;  Here we will present a program for creating records in thisformat:andM;First Last Title Company Address City, ST ZIP The instructions that followare specific to FoxBASE Plus, but it is a useful example to follow, becausethe actual syntax is practically generic to any popular database application.andO;The key ingredient is the addition of a separate field-a Ventura-recognizedcode.andP;  This code, a line break (andless;Randgt;), is used to convert each record in theresulting text file to a single &quot;paragraph&quot; in Ventura.andM;(1) We begin with the assumption that eight fields exist in the database:andM;FIRST LAST TITLE COMPANY ADDRESS CITY STATE ZIPandM;(2) Enter the following commands:andM;REPLACE ALL RETURN WITH 'andless;Randgt;'andM;MODI LABEL FILENAMEandM;(3) The last command above presents the following list of parameterson-screen.andP;  Enter these values:andM;Height of Label: 5 Width of Label: 80 Left Margin: 0 Lines Between Labels: 1Spaces Between Labels: 0 Numbers of Labels Across: 1 (4) On the next screen,enter these values:andM;1 TRIM(FIRST)+'_'_TRIM_(LAST)_+ _RETURN 2 TRIM(TITLE)_+_RETURN 3TRIM(COMPANY)_+_ RETURN 4 TRIM(ADDRESS)_+_RETURN 5 TRIM(CITY)+'_'+_TRIM(STATE)+'_'+_TRIM ( ZIP )andM;Steps (5) and (6) areandM;INDEX ON LAST TO TEMPandM;LABEL FORM FILENAME TO VENBASEandM;(7) Load the resulting file, VENBASE .TXT, into Ventura in ASCH format.andP;  Thisis very important, as the result from the above program would otherwise bezero returns between records in Ventura.andP;  (Ventura will recognize two retumsas one when reading ASCII files.) The above list could be used for theexamples of mail-merging we discussed in Tip 3 .andP;  If you're generating areport or other output that should be presented in a columnar format,substitute a field called Tab for the Return field.andP;  Then replace Tab withthe code andless;9andgt; and insert accordingly into the syntax.andP;  This code will berecognized in Ventura as a tab character.andM;TIP 8: Ventura's Professional Extension accommodates Lotus .PRN files withits PRN-to-Table import option, but you may prefer to format your numericaldata for Ventura 2.0 or Professional Extension using tabs as the basis foralignment.andP;  If so, you can effectively use your word processor to replace thespaces between spreadsheet columns with tabs.andM;If you're using Microsoft Word, for example, you can take advantage of itsautomatic replacement feature, available under the program's spreadsheetlinking option.andP;  First bring the spreadsheet file into Word, then follow theinstructions below to replace spaces with tabs for worksheets in .andP;  WKS, .WK1, or .XLS formats:andM;(1) In MS Word, go to the Library option.andP;  (2) Choose Link.andP;  (3) Enter thefilename or a wildcard (*) specification such as C:\LOTUS\*.VATKI; then hitF1.andM;(4) If you've entered a wildcard specification, point to the correctfilename.andM;(5a) If you want to bring in the entire spreadsheet, hit Enter.andM;(5b) If you want to extract only a range, hit the Tab key before hittingEnter.andP;  This will position you in the Area option .andP;  If the table already hasa range name, type this.andP;  If not, just enter the spreadsheet value range (forexample, A1..G8).andM;(6) Hit Enter.andM;The program now inserts a tab between each pair of columns in thespreadsheet.andP;  If the &quot;insert an extra column&quot; method was used to create spacebetween data columns, you'll find extra tabs between these columns; removethem before loading the file into Ventura.andP;  If you didn't use yourspreadsheet's aligmnent feature (you used the Spacebar to push data intoposition within cells), the extra spaces will transfer with the data.andP;  Deletethem.andM;A hidden text line is created and retains the link to the spreadsheet fromwithin the text file.andP;  This must be deleted before loading the file intoVentura.andM;At the end of each line, there is a line break (an arrow pointing down andleft) instead of a return (a new-paragraph character).andP;  As a result, theentire table is really one large paragraph.andP;  Ventura has a size limitationfor paragraphs; any paragraph with more than 8,000 characters will berejected.andP;  For this reason, it may be necessary to break larger tables into aseries of data ranges while you import them from other programs, replace someline breaks with returns where possible, or both.andP;  Remember also that Venturahas a limit of 16 tab settings per paragraph.andM;If your word processor does not incorporate an automatic replacement feawre,its own search/replace option can speed the process of taking a .PRN or ASCIIfile and replacing all the spaces between columns with tabs.andM;After loading the file from the spreadsheet, locate the area with the largestnumber of spaces between columns.andP;  Count those spaces.andP;  Then set the Searchcommand for that number of spaces and set Replace with a tab character.andM;Once the largest column width has been replaced with a tab, continue theprocess counting down one space at a time in the Search command.andP;  If only onespace originally exists between columns, use your word processor's columnselection option (if it has one) to replace spaces.andM;TIP 9: Microsoft Excel is a popular tool in many corporations.andO;Unfortunately, it outputs offly to its proprietary .XLC format.andP;  Here are twoways to get your Excel Chart files into Ventura.andM;If you merely need to get the graphic elements of your chart into Ventura (notext elements), copy the Metafile converter program CLIPV2.EXE from theVentura utilities disk to the Windows directory.andP;  Open the Excel Chart fileyou want to use, maximize its window, select the chart, then use Shift-Editto get to the Copy Picture menu.andP;  This pastes the picture onto the Windowsclipboard in Metafile format (which Ventura can use).andP;  Run CLIPV2 .EXE; thisautomatically loads the Metafile image from the Windows clipboard.andP;  Maximizethe CLIPV2 window and save the pasted file.andM;If you do need both text and graphics, try the second option.andP;  (Ibis methodis also useful for importing images that cannot be produced in Metafilefon-nat, like bitmap images.) All Windows applications can print using anysupported Windows device; the HP plotters are among these devices, andVentura accepts .HPG files.andM;(1) Open the WIN .INI file.andP;  (2) Add a disk file as an output port (forinstance, CHART.HPG = COM-1:):andM;(3) Save and exit Windows (to activate WIN .INI settings).andM;(4) Open Control.andP;  EXE and install an HP plotter as an output device.andP;  (The74 series or Color Pro options work best.)andM;(5) Change the paper method from manual to preloaded.andM;(6) Change the Connections menu for the HP plotter, choosing the filenameoutput port used earlier.andM;The chart prints to an .HPG format that is compatible with Ventura Publisher.andO;All of the solid colors will convert to black during the process; to avoidthis, makeandM;This menu reveals the size and allocation of all memory.andP;  To access it, firstselect the Desk, Publisher's Info menu.andP;  The ensuing dialog box contains theversion, date, and serial number and two rectangular outlines just above thecopyright line.andP;  The left one contains the company name, Ventura SoftwareInc.andP;  Click on the word Ventura here, and the diagnostic dialog box willappear.andM;TIP 13: Send overflow files to a RAMdisk or local drive.andM;One of the many modifications you can make to the VP.BAT file is to designatea separate disk, generally a RAMdisk, for overflow files.andP;  When Ventura isrunning on a network, you can utilize the same switch to improve performanceby sending oveflow files to the local hard disk.andP;  For example, if the localdrive is C:, just add the following switch to the VPNET.BAT:andM;/O=C: TIP 14 :When base memory is low, there's one solution to avoid.andM;When you try to load Ventura but not enough conventional memory is available,the program displays a message to that effect before aborting.andP;  It suggeststhat you remedy the memory shortage by adding the approximate amount to the/A switch in the VP.andP;  BAT.andP;  Using the /A switch, however, can produce adverseresults if you're printing to anything other than a PostScript device.andO;Rather than risk further disaster, avoid the /A switch altogether.andP;  Instead,investigate your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT for extraneous options and TSRsthat can be modified or eliminated; it is possible to run Ventura on anynonnetworked PC equipped with a minimum of 640K.andM;TIP 15 :There are many options for overcoming memory shortages caused bynetwork overhead.andP;  Here are some of the most reliable.andM;The network version of Ventura Publisher directly supports Novell, 3Com, andIBM network environments.andP;  Though not specifically listed in the installationmenu, other networks will work; Banyan's VINES is an example.andP;  What allnetworks have in common is the need to utilize a certain amount ofconventional memory at the local workstation.andP;  Memory requirements will varygreatly among networks-but also among workstations running on the samenetwork.andP;  This is mainly due to different options in use.andM;When memory is a problem, your first step should be to investigate allpossible reductions in the driver set and user profile.andP;  Also, look to reduceor eliminate unnecessary environment modifiers, excessive paths, last drives,or large file and buffer statements; all are responsible for heistingprecious memory.andM;If you still have a memory shortage, the optimal way to increase your supplydepends on your system.andP;  If you have a 286based PC, you may want to spend themoney for an expanded memory board.andP;  If you already have extended memory inyour 286, you can use an expanded memory manager to simulate EMS; there's nonoticeable speed degradation in going this route.andP;  You can also useHIMEM.SYS, a driver included with Microsoft Windows.andP;  HIMEM.andP;  SYS essentiallyadds 64K to conventional memory.andP;  Some programs cannot utilize&quot;high&quot; memory,but Ventura does.andP;  The memory can't be verified through a normal CHKDSK, butit can be viewed with certain memory managers or by entering Ventura's hiddendiagnostic menu.andM;To install HIMEM.andP;  SYS, just copy the driver to your root directory, andinclude the following line in the CONFIG.andP;  SYS:andM;DEVICE=C:\HIMEM.SYSandM;Then reboot.andM;If you have a 386 machine, emulating EMS in extended memory is the fastest,most cost-effective choice.andP;  Just beware of the trade-off that exists becauseof the means! The utility you use may appropriate a significant amount ofconventional memory, thereby nullifying the effort.andP;  A good choice for 386systems is Expanded Memory, Manager 386 from Quarterdeck Office Systems.andP;  Itrequires only I K of conventional memory, it's easy to install, and it works.andM;TIP 16: Increase screen buffers to speed operation.andM;The /F switch you create in the VP .BAT file has one of two uses here.andO;Reduction of RAM in the buffer will force Ventura to take less conventionalmemory while loading (no /F switch assumes the default, 68K), Conversely, ifEMS or HIMEM .SYS has freed excessive conventional memory, this memory can beadded to the screen buffer to increase the speed with which screens areredrawn.andM;To determine how much conventional memory you might use for this purpose, goto the hidden dialog box and note the external memory remaining.andP;  When youare using Version 2.0, the amount over IOOK can be added to the /F switch.andO;If you're using Professional Extension or the network version, the amountover 48K can be used-when EMS is available.andM;TIP 17: Steep yourself in Ventura literature.andP;  You don't want the people yousupport to stump you with questions you can't answer.andM;Books worth reading include Ted Nance's all-time favorite, Ventura Tips andTricks (Peachpit Press, (415) 5278555, $18.95) and Rick Altman's VenturaPower Tools (Sybex Inc., (800) 227-2346, $34.95).andP;  The latter's emphasis onproductivity is reinforced by the inclusion of several valuable utilities.andO;Ventura Professional, a publication of the Ventura Professional Users Groupin San Jose ((408) 227-5030), is an excellent source that offers informationpertinent to all levels of users.andP;  A year's subscription costs $36; since themagazine is published on a monthly basis, it has the significant advantage ofkeeping you up to date on the latest evolutions of the most powerful DTPprogram written for the PC.andM;DESKT0P PUBLISHING: Management by Objectives Desktop publishing is only asefficient as the people who use and manage it.andP;  But as obvious as thisstatement may appear, unproductive practices abound.andP;  Too often, publicationsare thrown together haphazardly; no plan exists up front for the propermanagement of copy-editing tasks, file-formatting procedures, file-trakingissues, and other elements that can affect both the cost and the time spenton a project.andP;  Because of the multitude and variety of tasks involved,implementing publication management policies to deal successfully with theseissues will save you and your company both money and labor in the long run.andM;In some companies, desktop publishing is managed by someone whose title ispublisher and who assumes the responsibility for establishing submissionschedules.andP;  In other companies, the &quot;desktop publisher&quot; is an individual whohas been promoted from a wordprocessing position and is supervised by adesktop publishing manager, In either case, one person should retain theauthority to set schedules and establish guidelines - for a variety ofdepartments - that define when and how files should be submitted.andM;The following suggestions will help DTP managers achieve these objectives.andO;While we provide explicit details for Ventura Publisher, the basic conceptsapply to working with all desktop publishing products.andM;* Begin by establishing one basic rule: No files (whether text, tables, orgraphics) are to be delivered to the desktop  publisher before all involvedparties have been given the opportunity to offer their final approval,andM;* If you as the manager are not operationally proficient with Ventura, workclosely with your desktop publisher to develop publication plans.andP;  Otherwise,you run the risk of overlooking critical tasks and file-formattingconsiderations that will affect your deadline.andP;  (Improperly formatted textwithin word processing files is often a major source of delay.andP;  Text shouldbe set aligned left, ragged right.andP;  Don't bother spending time on extraneousformatting-such as bold or underlining to offset headings-that is notintended to be reproduced the same way in the Ventura documents.)andM;* A well-thought-out plan will facilitate production of a publication withnumerous contributors.andP;  Take, for instance, a quarterly financial report thatis to include text, Lotus 1-2-3 tables, and graphics; different files mayoriginate from the marketing, finance, and research departments.andP;  All will beintegrated by the desktop publisher using Ventura.andM;To ensure that all materials reach die desktop publisher early enough for diereport to be finished on schedule, it is necessary first to analyze theproject and develop a production outline.andP;  To do this, break the report intodistinct elements, then designate the person or department who will be heldaccountable for each.andP;  If as in the adjoining &quot;Production Outline,&quot;responsibilities are categorized by department, then individual assignmentsmay be left up to the department managers.andM;* Consider the tasks, such as copy editing, that need to be accomplished inorder to produce Ventura-ready files from all of the departments involved.andO;Assign realistic time values to each task, bearing in mind the publication'sdeadline.andM;Don't overlook any preproduction tasks, such as style sheet design andapproval, spreadsheet file import to other applications for graphicsproduction, or cleaning up spreadsheet tables for text import.andP;  For example:andM;Graphics 1-5 Deadline for analysts to approve spreadsheet data: 11 /2 Tablesprinted to disk, ready for graphics production: 11/3 Graphics in .CGM format,routed to desktop publisher: 11/6andM;* Whenever possible, establish filenaming conventions to be used and includethem in the production schedule.andP;  Using this method facilitates file trackingin instances like the one shown above, where the same file will be handled bymore than one person.andM;* Give everyone who is involved a copy of the production schedule.andP;  Demandthat they adhere to this schedule and keep it up to date.andM;* After production is finished, evaluate the success or failure of theprocedure you have created.andP;  Consider making improvements on it for your nextpublishing cycle.andP;  As your contributors grow more and more sophisticated, forexample, you can ask them to embed Ventura tags in the word processing filesthey hand in.andP;  This procedure saves production time, as files imported toVentura will automatically appear with the formatting established in yourstyle sheet (fonts will be changed, line rules added, and so on).andP;  MANAGEMENTON A NETWORKandM;While good publication-management practices are always important, they becomeabsolutely crucial for managers in charge of a Ventura desktop publishingnetwork.andM;In the network version of Ventura Publisher, the program files are installedas read-only, and all chapter files are protected against having more thanone user gain full read/write privileges at the same time.andP;  The Browsefeature allows a user to view, but not alter, a chapter that another user hasalready opened.andM;Remember, though, that a Ventura chapter file is not a composite of all thefiles used to create what appears on your screen.andP;  It is more like aninstructional file that tracks all ancillary files that make up a chapter.andO;Though it is safeguarded in a network environment, the ancllary files itreferences are not equally protected.andM;To prevent a desktop publisher or anyone else from having to amend anancillary file outside of Ventura-and to avoid the problems that can resultfrom this - make sure that everyone ob- , serves the cadinal rule of havingsuch files approved befor they are forwarded for referencing.andM;Good publishing habits, along with an awareness of Ventura's file-managementand network features, will protect- you from potential disasters.andP;  Theproductivity benefits of using Ventura in a multiuser environment certainlywarrant any time you can spend developing a process that suits both yourcontributors and the producers of your publications.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
