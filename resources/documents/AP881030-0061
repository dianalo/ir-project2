The protests came just days after Soviet officials reportedlypromised to release all political prisoners and after some membersof the Supreme Soviet voted against tougher measures against publicdemonstrations.   Dissidents designated Sunday _ the 16th anniversary of the deathin prison of poet Yuri Galanskov _ as the day on which they wouldcommemorate Soviet political prisoners.   Leningrad police arrested 36 protesters who gathered near KazanCathedral along Nevsky Prospekt, said Yuri Mityunov, a spokesman inMoscow for the Democratic Union, which bills itself as analternative to the Communist Party.   ``They were arrested without basis _ for holding candles andreading poetry,'' Mityunov said in a telephone interview.   At least 14 people were arrested in Moscow, he said. No violencewas reported in either city.   In Moscow, several hundred people milled across the street fromPushkin Square in the early evening, Mityunov said. Police andmembers of a new paramilitary force to control demonstrations usedbullhorns to urge the crowd to disperse but did not interfere withthe heated political discussions.   One man, told by police to move off a step, proclaimed he had aright to stand there, marched in place and told a police officer,``I'm going, I'm going.'' He was not forced to move.   Mityunov said five members of the Democratic Union were arrestedbefore they reached Pushkin Square, where they had planned to stagea demonstration. He said two of the arrested were still held,including one who raised a banner after most of the crowd left thearea near the square.   Mityunov said four other members of the Democratic Union whowere arrested on their way to Pushkin Square appeared in court.   Dissident sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidfive members of the Initiative Group for Holding Demonstrations andMeetings also were arrested near Pushkin Square when they raisedbanners in support of political prisoners.   Last week, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told reporters inMoscow after meetings with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev thatthe Soviet Union promised to release within 10 weeks everyoneregarded in the West as a political prisoner.   The Soviet Union says it only considers a few dozen peoplepolitical prisoners, but Western sources and dissidents estimatethat several hundred people are in prisons, camps, psychiatrichospitals or exiled from their homes because of their beliefs.   ``We have very little faith that all political prisoners will befreed,'' Mityunov said. ``There is a very big difference betweenwhat the authorities promise and what they actually do.''   On Friday, some members of the Supreme Soviet voted againstdecrees giving paramilitary forces broad powers to controldemonstrations and requiring advance approval from authorities forpublic protests.   Although the measures passed easily with 1348 votes, the 31``no'' votes were the first dissident votes in memory in theSupreme Soviet.</TEXT></DOC>
