<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-04-0573 </DOCNO><TEXT>The K/sup {pi}/ = 0/sup -/ bands in even uranium nuclei were studied inthe compound reactions /sup 231/Pa(p,2n)/sup 230/U, /sup 230,232/Th({alpha},2n)/sup232,234/U and /sup 236/U(d,pn)/sup 236/U. In-beam {gamma}-rays were measuredin coincidence with conversion-electrons, which were detected with aniron-free orange spectrometer. The negative-parity levels are observedup to intermediate spins (Iandless;13/sup -/). In addition, the 1/sup -/ and3/sup -/ levels in /sup 230/U were confirmed by a decay study with anisotope separated /sup 230/Pa source. For the heavier isotopes (A andgt; orapprox. 232) the properties of the K/sup {pi}/ = 0/sup -/ bands (energiesand {gamma}-branchings) are consistent with a vibrational character ofthese bands. For /sup 230/U the K/sup {pi}/ = 0/sup -/ band lies at ratherlow energy (E(1/sup -/) = 367 keV), and the level spacings within thisband are very similar to those of the isotones /sup 228/Th and /sup 226/Ra,which might indicate the onset of a stable octupole deformation.</TEXT></DOC>
