Cable giant Turner Broadcasting System Inc. and ActMedia, amarketing firm specializing in promotions in the store, saidThursday they are teaming up to design a TV service for shopperslined up to bag and pay for their groceries.   The Checkout Channel will feature news, sports and otherspecially-tailored programming _ plus advertising _ on TV monitorsplaced above each checkout aisle.   Turner and ActMedia plans to test the service this summer,launch it nationally in early 1991 and install it in 5,000supermarkets by mid-1992.   Wayne W. LoCurto, chief executive and president of ActMedia,said the service should help advertisers reach 30 million to 40million people each week while making the wait in the checkout linemore enjoyable for shoppers.   If the plan works, it would be the latest commercialencroachment into places that formerly were beyond the reach oftelevision advertisers.   In recent months, media companies either have introduced orannounced plans to develop commercial TV programs designed to reachteens in the classroom, women at the beauty salon and patients inthe doctor's waiting room.   ``There will be a few people to complain, but we believe theoverwhelming majority of people will like it,'' LoCurto said in atelephone interview.   ``It's informative, entertaining and it's going to make theirwait seem to go quicker,'' he said.   Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting has agreed to createspecially-tailored programs of news, sports, business, weather andconsumer information taken mainly from its Headline News cablenetwork. Each eight-minute program will include 2{ minutes ofcommercials.   The programs will be delivered by satellite 24 hours a day toparticipating stores which will be equipped with TV monitors aboveeach checkout aisle.   ActMedia plans to provide the TV sets and the satellite hardware.   LoCurto said the sets will be designed so that the sound shutsoff unless someone approaches within a half-dozen feet or so of themonitor.   But once someone gets that close, there will be no way to shutthe set off or adjust the volume, he said.   He said the programs are being broken into eight-minute shows,roughly the same amount of time as the average wait in a checkoutline.   Turner and ActMedia plan to test the system from August throughOctober in 12 stores in six cities, although they would not namethe cities. LoCurto said plans are to begin a national service inthe first quarter of 1991 and said he hopes to have the CheckoutChannel in 5,000 of the nation's 30,000 supermarkets by mid-1992.   LoCurto declined to give the cost of launching the system or therelative investments of Turner and ActMedia in the venture.   ActMedia expects to generate about $100 million a year inrevenue from the the two minutes of advertising time it sells oneach eight-minute program, while Turner will get to keep proceedsfrom the ads in the remaining half-minute.   LoCurto said Actmedia will share some of its revenue withsupermarkets. Advertisers will be asked to pay rates roughlyequivalent to those charged on daytime television.   Ad time will be sold for terms of a year or more with an annualrate of about $12 million for a 15-second ad in each show once thesystem is in 5,000 stores.   ActMedia, based in Darien, Conn., and a unit of Heritage MediaCorp. of Dallas, Texas, was founded in 1973 and is the leader inin-store marketing programs. It operates couponing and samplingprograms and places advertising on shopping carts, aisledirectories and store shelves in 20,000 supermarkets.</TEXT></DOC>
