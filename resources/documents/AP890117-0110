KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   On Friday Ronald Reagan becomes the 32nd formerpresident of the United States, posing anew the question of how _ orwhether _ the nation can use the experience of its former chiefexecutives.   The country has no formal structure for doing so, but formerPresident Harry F. Truman thought he had an idea.   In his memoirs, ``Mr. Citizen,'' Truman proposed that formerpresidents be made non-voting ``Free members of the Congress.''   ``The former president, of course, could not be expected to sitstill, just waiting to be called on for an expression of opinion,''Truman said. ``More often he would want to speak up on matters whichhe might deem necessary to bring to the attention of the Congress.''   ``Arguments and debate are what make a free government and aformer president could be counted on to stimulate and even provokedebate,'' the former president said.   It would, said Truman, ``stop the waste of a vast storehouse ofexperince'' and, to some extent, ``help bridge a certain gap in thecontinuity of our government.''   Although Truman's suggestion was never adopted, it was in markedcontrast with the tongue-in-cheek proposal offered by formerPresident William Howard Taft.   Ex-presidents, said the ex-president, should be chloroformed andceremonially cremated immediately after leaving office.   This, said Taft, would ``fix his place in history and enable thepublic to pass on to new men and new measures.''   Taft ignored his own view, and instead had one of history's mostdistinguished and satisfying post-presidential careers, becomingchief justice.   There were times, he remarked, when he could hardly remember everhaving been president at all.   Of course the first president to attach ``former'' to his titlewas George Washington.   ``Perhaps the most important decision ever made concerning anex-president was Washington's decision to become one,'' wrote JohnWhiteclay Chambers in American Heritage magazine in 1979.``Conceivably, he might have stayed in office until he died,establishing a far different tradition than the voluntaryrelinquishing of power.''   Ever since Washington retired to the life of a gentleman farmer,former presidents have sometimes been called on for their expertise_ and sometimes ignored altogether.   Grover Cleveland became a former president twice, having won theoffice for a second non-consecutive term after a four-year time out.Eight presidents died in office, never achieving the status ofex-president.   The second president, John Adams, became a virtual politicalexile. But his son, John Qunicy Adams, won election to the House ofRepresentatives after his presidency and served 17 years.   Three former presidents sought the presidency again and failed.   Truman, determined to end 20 years of neglect, reached out toformer Republican President Herbert Hoover twice, naming him firstto get food to hungry people after World War II, then to head acommission that recommended ways to streamline the government.   The Former Presidents Act of 1958 granted ex-presidents an annualincome and authorized them to hire a staff and operate from a suiteof offices furnished at government expense. It granted ex-presidentsfree mailing privileges. And it provided a pension for presidentialwidows.   In 1963, Congress also granted former presidents transition fundsto be used in the first six months after leaving office.   After President John F. Kennedy was assasinated in 1963, Congressgranted all former presidents Secret Service protection.   And in 1969 a townhouse on Lafayette Square near the White Housewas set aside for the use of former presidents visiting the capital.   Nearly all recent former presidents have written books,justifying their conduct in office or offering ideas and proposals.   Hoover opened the first presidential library, and all of hissuccessors have followed his example.   All of this provides a base for sharing that wealth of experienceof which Truman spoke. Several recent presidents have.   Richard Nixon, struggling to emerge from the Watergate cloud thatforced his resignation as president, has written several books offoreign policy advice.   Jimmy Carter has engaged in campaigns to improve world health andhuman rights conditions. Through his hands-on carpenter's work withHabitat for Humanity, he has campaigned for decent housing for thepoor. He has also written several books, including one on MiddleEast policy.   And this year Gerald R. Ford, teaming with Carter, issued adetailed volume of advice to the next president, including thewarning that there may be no other way to eliminate the federalbudget deficit but to raise taxes.</TEXT></DOC>
