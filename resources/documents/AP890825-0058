Climate shifts and a rising sea level could pit rich nationsagainst poor, northern nations against southern, and inland nationsagainst coastal, participants at a U.S.-Soviet conference on globalwarming said Thursday.   A sea-level rise of three feet in the next century would forcemillions of people to flee the lowlands of Bangladesh and otherThird World nations, creating ``environmental refugees,'' saidastronomer Carl Sagan.   ``Where will those people go? Are there going to be food wars? Orwater wars? What happens if the American Midwest becomes scrubdesert?'' Sagan asked.   Sagan is one of more than 80 Americans and 11 Sovietsparticipating in a four-day symposium dubbed ``greenhouse glasnost''by its co-sponsors, the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Institutefor Resource Management, founded by actor-filmmaker Robert Redford.   ``We have to get past this business of hearing the phrase, `Weneed more study,''' Redford said. ``We must act.''   The United States and Soviet Union are the world's biggestproducers of carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons, gases that trapsolar heat in a process called the greenhouse effect.   The superpowers' leadership is needed because developing nationsare fast catching up with the superpowers in producing pollutants,Sagan said.   ``You can't tell these Third World countries, `Please don't dowhat we did,''' he said. ``The United States and Soviet Union haveto come in with economically feasible alternatives.''   Developing countries have few resources to adapt to major climateshifts, Sagan said, but even wealthy nations cannot stop globalwarming alone.   ``The planet is a unit. No one nation can solve the problem,'' hesaid. ``We're all in the greenhouse together.''   Soviet scientist Roald Sagdeev recalled a warning he recentlygave a Russian audience: ``I suggested that the issue ofenvironmental survival should be elevated to the level of nuclearsurvival.''   Conference organizers hope to contact President Bush and Sovietleader Mikhail Gorbachev to urge concrete steps to reduce globalwarming.   Suggested strategies include: increasing energy efficiency toreduce levels of carbon dioxide emitted by burning fossil fuels;slowing the destruction of the world's forests; and planting newtrees.   Although scientists do disagree, ``they're all in the sameballpark,'' Sagan said. Various studies predict global temperatureswill rise 3 to 10 degrees during the next century. Even the lowfigure could cause catastrophic climate changes.   ``That there is something to worry about _ a concurrence of theoracles _ is very clear,'' Sagan said.   But it may not be the lack of knowledge that proves the biggeststumbling block, said Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.   ``Politicians are aware, but politicians are ferventlyshort-sighted,'' Bradley said. ``They look at the next election andnot the next generation.''   If policymakers wait for more conclusive evidence, it will be toolate, said Peter Gleick, a researcher at the Pacific Institute forStudies in Development, Environment and Security.   ``Even if we were to take drastic actions today, climate changesare already in the works,'' he said.   Soviets at the conference include climatologists, a filmmaker andan author. Americans include scientists and business, environmental,and political leaders.   Redford said the conference invited non-scientists to spreadsupport for the fight against global warming.   ``We're here to pass the baton from scientific people, who knowwhat's going on, to the rest of us, who can do something about it,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
