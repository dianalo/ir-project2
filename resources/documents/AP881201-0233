This script has been replayed several times in recent years aspart of an effort by federal regulators to shift the costs of thelocal phone network to local customers.   For about half of all customers, long-distance price cuts of 38percent since 1984 have more than offset the rise in local rates,according to the Federal Communications Commission. Those in theother half, however, don't call long-distance enough to benefit.Instead, their overall bill is higher.   Beginning today, customers will see another 60 cents added totheir monthly local phone bill, and American Telephone andamp; TelegraphCo. will drop its basic interstate long-distance rates an average of3.8 percent.   US Sprint said it will drop its rates Jan. 1 an average 3.85percent, about the same for business as for residential customers.MCI expects to announce details of a price cut next month.   ATandamp;T is able to make its $697 million annual reduction, and USSprint and MCI theirs, because costs of connecting to the localnetwork are being reduced by the corresponding increase incustomers' monthly bills.   With today's 60-cent increase, the subscriber line charge hasrisen to $3.20. The federal charge, imposed in 1985, is designed toreduce the subsidy long-distance companies pay to maintain the localnetwork.   A customer who makes about $5.20 per month in direct-dialedlong-distance calls saves enough to offset the effects of the linecharge, according to James L. Lande in the FCC's industry analysisdivision,   ``About half the people are at least breaking even,'' he said.   ATandamp;T will cut its basic long-distance rates for calls travelingmore than 124 miles by 3.8 percent. It will make smaller cuts inrates for interstate calls of shorter distances, which account forabout one-quarter of ATandamp;T interstate calls.   The largest among the price cuts will go to large volume users,both residential and business.   Rates for Reach Out America, ATandamp;T's long-distance calling planfor residential customers, will be cut 4.9 percent.   ATandamp;T WATS rates will drop 4 percent and the company willrestructure the service to bill calls individually based on time anddistance, rather than by the current hourly pricing method. Thisprice reduction is to take effect Jan. 1, a month later than theothers.   Rates for ATandamp;T's three PRO WATS calling plans for businesscustomers will be cut 3.8 percent overall. MEGACOM WATS rates willdrop 4.7 percent and MEGACOM 800 rates will go down 4.5 percent.   Basic ATandamp;T 800 service prices will go down 3.6 percent, andSoftware Defined Network Service rates will see an overall reductionof 6.2 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
