The review wasconducted to establish the extent of research conducted on the VisibilityIndex. The Index was designed to provide the method for examining theeffective value of such properties as color, texture, pattern, contrast,and other variables which can be used to improve the effectiveness ofwarning devices, signs, labels, and markings aimed at providing increasedsafety through visible means. Future research was to be conducted inorder to evaluate the effectiveness of increasing visibility as a meansof reducing the hazard of a worker being struck or injured because hewas not able to see a hazard in his path. References were cited for existingstandards for visibility in the U.S. and foreign countries along withinternational standards. Other areas for which references were listedinclude current practices (air and ground transportation, safety clothing,underwater visibility, visibility measurement, and industrial and occupationapplications), design factors (camouflage, pattern recognition, colorcontrast, luminance contrast, area, and reflectivity), and environmentalvariables (illumination, background, types of lighting, distance andmoving targets).</TEXT></DOC>
