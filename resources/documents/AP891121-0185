The non-binding resolution came a day after Congress refused toattach any restrictions on this year's $85 million in U.S. militaryaid to El Salvador, heeding President Bush's argument that such amove would undercut the new government of rightist presidentAlfredo Cristiani.   But Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., noted that ``voteslike yesterday's can be misinterpreted,'' and added, ``Thisresolution makes clear that we deplore all violence in El Salvador,whether it comes from the extreme right or the communist left.''   The comments were indicative of a growing restiveness inCongress with U.S. policy toward El Salvador.   ``The question isn't what we think of the rebels,'' said Rep.David Obey, D-Wis., whose Appropriations subcommittee writesforeign aid legislation.   ``The question is what we think of the ability of the existingpolicy to succeed. The very fact that the rebels have been able todo this after ten years of supporting the Salvador governmentdemonstrates to me that that government is not nearly as in controlof the military situation as they have indicated.''   Added Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan.: ``The extremists on both sidesare driving this country into the sea. And in the meantime, U.S.citizens are starting to get affected by it. The president needs topersonally get involved to get a cease-fire in place.''   The Senate resolution was similar to a resolution passed a dayearlier by the House, and stated ``unequivocally'' that if thegovernment does not make a good-faith effort to apprehend andprosecute the murderers of six Jesuit priests and two apparentwitnesses, ``the Congress will carefully review and consider thequestion of aid to El Salvador.''   ``The military and those who may have been involved in some ofthese violent acts should understand that ... we're not necessarilygoing to be writing a blank check in perpetuity, and it's extremelyimportant that President Cristiani understand this,'' said Sen.Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.   Congress ``may find it necessary to condition or curtail''future Salvadoran aid, he said.   The resolution also asked that the Bush administration report toCongress by Feb. 20 on the status of the investigation into thosedeaths.   Dole said Tuesday's guerrilla attack on a San Salvador hotelreaffirmed Congress' decision not to slap limits on the militaryaid for Cristiani's government.   But the resolution also gave those who voted againstrestrictions on U.S. aid a day earlier a chance to vote forlanguage deploring violence, in the face of heavy lobbying andpublic protests by church and other groups opposed to U.S. aid.   It was approved unanimously with Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, notvoting.   As the Senate vote proceeded, police forcibly removed severalprotesters from the visitors' galleries who began shouting commentsagaint U.S. policy. The entire gallery was cleared for the secondtime this week, something that has happened only twice before inthis century.   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., objected to the action, saying, ``It'sgiving in to a few malcontents to clear everybody out because thereare a few disturbers.''   U.S. Capitol Police said three demonstrators were arrested oncharges of disrupting Congress and demonstrating within theCapitol. Each charge is punishable by a maximum fine of $500 and orsix months in jail.</TEXT></DOC>
