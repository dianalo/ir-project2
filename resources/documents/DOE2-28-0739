Thisessay suggests that Canada should follow the latter route and that policiesshould be adopted to move Canada to a position close to zero energy growthby the year 2000. The thesis is that such a target is both feasible anddesirable, with emphasis on the latter. Desirability is defined verybroadly to include economic, social and environmental aspects. This essayattempts to answer basic questions about the nature of a low-energy alternativefor Canada. In particular, energy conservation is associated with a largerconstruct called the conserver society, involving goals such as moderationin scale and in rates of change, emphasis on personal contact and community,and maintenance of a wide diversity of people and activities, as wellas with the more obvious connotations of reduced material throughputand an improved environment. In this construct, zero energy growth isquite compatible with Canadian conditions that require major attentionto space heating and a large transportation sector. Combined with thefact that the energy intended to be conserved includes all non-renewableenergy and any other energy produced under capital-intensive, centralizedconditions, but not small solar, biomass or wind plants, which can beaccepted without destroying the conserver society values, it is feltthat there is abundant energy for Canadians to live very well. 41 refs.,3 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
