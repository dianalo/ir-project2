He anticipates challenges to his expected prosecutions because of the congressional immunity the Iran-Contra committee extended to some of his targets. He has tapped former U.S. District Judge Herbert Stern as his &quot;special outside counsel.&quot; The trouble is that Judge Laurence Silberman's ruling last month invalidated independent counsels as unconstitutional, so if Mr. Walsh has any authority to act, it is under his parallel appointment as an employee of the Justice Department. Justice tells us no one there approved this move. Mr. Stern's first case may be a neat trick -- an unauthorized official defending his own unauthorized hiring. </TEXT></DOC>
