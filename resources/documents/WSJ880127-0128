But the relatively lenient sentence appeared unlikely to hinder journalists' use of confidential sources in Britain. The High Court could have jailed Independent newspaper reporter Jeremy Warner for as many as two years or fined him an unlimited amount.    The Independent will pay his fine, Mr. Warner said in a telephone interview yesterday. He said he will continue to protect the identity of the sources involved in this case. He said he will still use anonymous sources, although the experience might make him &quot;think carefully&quot; about relying on such sources for stories involving price-sensitive information.    Mr. Warner's case was the first legal test of the government's financial-markets investigative powers under the 1986 Financial Services Act. The law, which took effect in November 1986, allows the government to force witnesses in insider-trading cases to testify or face fines or imprisonment.    In court yesterday, Vice Chancellor Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson condemned Mr. Warner's continued refusal to reveal his sources. Sir Nicolas, the sentencing judge, said he preferred a fine to imprisonment because jailing the reporter could lead to the &quot;creation of a martyr.&quot;    The government wanted Mr. Warner to divulge sources for articles he wrote in 1985 and 1986 that correctly predicted government antitrust decisions in two takeover attempts. There weren't any allegations that the 32-year-old reporter profited from the information. </TEXT></DOC>
