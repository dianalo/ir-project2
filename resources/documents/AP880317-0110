He said hehoped the troops would be kept well away from any fighting.   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., emerging from a classified briefing onthe situation, said lawmakers were assured that ``we're not goingto be involved down there. That's the pledge given me.'' He said``there had clearly been a penetration into Honduras'' bySandinista troops who were not in hot pursuit of Contras, but hesaid he opposed the sending of more U.S. troops to the area.   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd called President Reagan'sdecision to send 3,200 U.S. troops to Honduras an ``overreaction,''and a number of other legislators said they were still waiting forhard evidence from the White House to back up its claims.   ``We've heard the administration cry, `wolf, wolf,' before,''Byrd, D-W.Va., told reporters. ``I don't know when they're cryingwolf.'' Byrd said that even by mid-morning today, he had neitherbeen briefed nor contacted by the administration about the troopmovement.   ``I hope it does not prove to be counterproductive (and) doesnot derail the peace process,'' Byrd said.   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said: ``The White House has beenplaying politics with American aid, they have been playing politicswith the Contras, and now they are playing politics with Americanboys.''   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., generally a supporter of theadministration's Central America policies, said he was skepticalabout the need for sending troops.   He said the Sandinista incursion into Honduras represented ``acynical abandonment of the peace process,'' but added that it doesnot pose any serious threat to the United States, and therefore didnot clearly call for the sending of military forces.   ``I think it's a move the president may come to regret becausethe spectacle of American troops moving into Central America inconvoy, flying down there, I think is going to remind the Americanpeople of why they don't want this,'' said Sen. John Kerry,D-Mass., interviewed on NBC television.   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a member of the Senate ForeignRelations Committee, said the incident highlighted the need for newaid for the rebels, which has been twice rejected by Congress thisyear. He said only renewed aid will keep a regional peace processgoing.   ``The ... plan only works if the Contras have some assistanceand therefore there is some reason for the Sandinistas to deal withthem,'' Lugar said in an interview on ABC. ``I think it's veryimportant that things get back to the table and I hope our policieswill lead to that.''   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif, said: ``I think youhave to ask the question of whether 1,200 Nicaraguans going acrossthe Honduran border is a threat to U.S. national security,'' asSecretary of State George P. Shultz had argued in a briefingWednesday for congressional leaders.   In announcing Reagan's decision late Wednesday night, WhiteHouse spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said thousands of Sandinistatroops had entered Honduras and the Honduran government hadappealed for help. He said that for the time being, the U.S. troopswould remain about 125 miles from the area of hostilities.   Some lawmakers noted that Reagan is making a renewed push forContra aid and recalled a similar situation two years ago, whenNicaraguan troops went into border areas of Honduras two days aftera House vote against aid to the Contras and just before a Senatevote.   ``They have cried wolf so many times ... even supporters ofContra aid are somewhat skeptical,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.``It is apparently a major raid on a Contra camp in the jungles.Now, that does not pose a threat to Honduras or its capital.''   In the 1986 episode, President Reagan claimed that 1,500 troopshad gone across the border and used his emergency power to giveHonduras $20 million in military aid. Other U.S. officials laterput the number of troops at closer to 800, and it appeared thatHonduras had to be pressed to accept the ``emergency'' aid.   ``This is not the first time the president has made use of hismilitary authority after he lost a vote on the Contras,'' Rep.Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., said Wednesday night. ``PresidentReagan's decision to send the 82nd Airborne to Honduras has more todo with politics than with American security.''   But Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, appearing onABC-TV's ``Nightline'' program, held to the administration positionthat the Sandinistas were trying to deliver a ``death blow'' to theContras, who use Honduras as a haven. He said the administrationwould document the seriousness of the Sandinista threat in materialsubmitted to Congress today.   Some Republicans needed no convincing. Rep. Jack Fields,R-Texas, said, ``I don't think the president really had analternative'' to sending in U.S. forces.   ``The purpose is for them to demonstrate our commitment toregional peace and stability,'' Fields said.   But Byrd said the administration was going too far.   ``It's an overreaction,'' he said. ``The Sandinistas havecrossed over the border before and gone back.''   And Jason Isaacson, a spokesman for Sen. Christopher Dodd,D-Conn., said the senator saw the administration action as aneffort ``to divert attention from the Iran-Contra indictments andto turn up the heat on Congress for more aid to the Contras.''   Congressional leaders briefed Wednesday by top administrationofficials on the cross-border fighting had said the White Houseoffered no proof that U.S. interests were threatened or that theContras were on the verge of being wiped out.   The officials _ Shultz, White House Chief of Staff Howard Bakerand National Security Adviser Colin Powell _ told of a 1,500-manincursion targeted at Contra supply sources and the kidnapping ofrebel leaders, participants in the meeting said.   But the troops had destroyed no major supply sites and capturedno top Contra commanders, the administration conceded.   ``I suspect this is a little more orchestrated hype on the partof the administration,'' Dodd said after the meeting.   House Speaker Jim Wright said he was told by Nicaraguan ForeignMinister Miguel D'Escoto that President Daniel Ortega had asked theUnited Nations to send an observer group to the border area toinsure that neither side breaches the border.</TEXT></DOC>
