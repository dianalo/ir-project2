It also examines how very deepcuts would affect other aspects of the military balance and the politicaland international order more broadly. Originally presented at a NationalAcademy of Sciences seminar on the implications of proposals for strategicnuclear arms cuts, this book discusses: the purpose and effect of deepstrategic force reductions; the impact of defenses and of new technologiesand noncentral systems on offensive reductions; alliance issues; implicationsfor conventional forces; and the future of arms control.</TEXT></DOC>
