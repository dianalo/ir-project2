The court, without comment, left intact a West Virginia lawchallenged by a funeral service company as an infringement offree-speech rights.   The West Virginia Legislature in a 1983 law enacted extensivenew regulations of the funeral service industry.   The law barred companies from making unsolicited sales pitches,either door-to-door or over the phone, to potential customers.   National Funeral Services Inc. sells pre-arranged, or pre-need,funeral and burial services. The company is a West Virginiasubsidiary of Legacy One Inc., which owns funeral homes andcemeteries througout the Southeast and Midwest.   The company said it seeks to promote competition in the industryby offering its services before they are needed.   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last March said WestVirginia's ban on door-to-door and telemarketing sales does notviolate the free-speech protections of the Constitution's FirstAmendment.   The state has a legitimate interest in ``the protection ofconsumers from overreaching and high-pressure sales tactics of thismost unique product,'' the 4th Circuit court said. ``WestVirginia's ban on solicitation is supported by the substantialinterest of protecting privacy.''   The appeals court said the free-speech restrictions are minimal,noting that the state permits direct-mail and newspaperadvertisements for funeral services.   The Supreme Court on Oct. 2 left intact a similar Virginia lawprohibiting telephone solicitation for pre-arranged funerals.   The case acted on today is National Funeral Services vs.Rockefeller, 89-639.</TEXT></DOC>
