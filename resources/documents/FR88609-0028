The requirements of the standardwere proposed to supplement the existing electrical installation requirementscontained in 29 CFR Part 1910, Subpart S. Interested parties were givenuntil February 29, 1988, to submit written comments on the proposal, tofile objections, and to request a hearing. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Hearing </ITAG>OSHA has received 45 comments on the proposal, including 6 requests fora hearing. In response to the objections raised and hearing requests receivedand in accordance with section 6(b)(3) of the Occupational Safety and HealthAct, OSHA has scheduled an informal public hearing to be held on August9, 1988. The hearing is being held to examine all issues raised by theproposal, including, but not limited to, the following: (1) The United Steelworkers of America (Exhibit 4-45) objects to the removalof existing regulations, such as andSection; 1910.265(c)(12), on the groundsthat the existing provisions are more protective than the correspondingprovisions in the proposa1. OSHA requests information on which of the existingregulations that were proposed to be removed are more protective than theelectrical safety-related work practices proposed to be added to 29 CFRPart 1910, Subpart S. (2) The United Steelworkers of America (Exhibit 4-45) also argues thatthe proposal is too performance oriented. OSHA requests information onwhether or not the proposal is too performance oriented, on what specificprovisions are vague and unenforceable, and on what changes could be madeto these provisions to make them enforceable. (3) Two of the hearing requests object to the scope of the proposal (proposedandSection; 1910.331). The Edison Electric Institute (Exhibit 4-10) objectsto the application of the proposal to work on or near electric utilizationinstallations within an electric power generating plant. The National ArboristsAssociation (Exhibit 4-30) objects to the proposal's coverage of the treecare industry. In view of these objections, OSHA requests information onthe issue of whether or not the scope of the standard is appropriate asproposed. (4) Three of the hearing requests object to the proposed requirements relatedto training (proposed andSection; 1910.332). They claim that the proposal'straining provisions are inadequate and do not provide sufficient protectionfrom electrical hazards. The AFL-CIO (Exhibit 4-32) suggests that the requirementsbe expanded to cover the qualifications of the trainer, duration of thetraining, and demonstration of effectiveness of the training. The UnitedSteelworkers of America (Exhibit 4-45) suggests that all workers be requiredto receive training and that the amount of required training be increased.The International Brotherhood of Teamsters (Exhibit 4-26) objects to OSHA'sfailure to provide a description, in objective terms, of what exposureto electrical hazards would trigger the training provisions. In view ofthese objections, OSHA requests information on the issue of whether ornot the proposed training requirements would provide adequate protectionfrom electrical hazards. OSHA also requests specific modifications of thelanguage proposed in andSection; 1910.332 that would improve employee safety.(5) Three of the hearing requests object to the proposed requirements forlockout and tagging of electric circuits and equipment (andSection; 1910.333(b)).The Edison Electric Institute (Exhibit 4-10) argues that OSHA's proposalis inconsistent with tagging procedures in use by electric utilities whichprovide sufficient protection to employees. The International Brotherhoodof Teamsters (Exhibit 4-26) requests that the lockout and tagging provisionsbe strengthened. They argue that tags should not be permitted to be usedwithout locks and that there should be one lock per employee working ona given piece of equipment. The AFL-CIO (Exhibit 4-32) recommends thatthe lockout and tagging provisions be expanded to cover non-electricalas well as electrical hazards. OSHA requests comments on the issue of whetheror not the lockout and tagging requirements proposed in andSection; 1910.333(b)are reasonable and appropriate for the protection of employees. (6) The Edison Electric Institute (Exhibit   4-10) objects to the requirementsproposed in andSection; 1910.333(c)(3)(ii) pertaining to work by qualifiedpersons near overhead power lines. They argue that only trained and experiencedutility linemen should be permitted to install electrical protective equipmenton overhead power lines and that anyone other than these employees, line-clearancetree trimmers, and communications workers should be required to maintaina minimum clearance of 10 feet from overhead power lines. OSHA thereforerequests public comment on the issue of whether or not the standard shouldallow other qualified employees to come closer than 10 feet to overheadpower lines and, if so, under what circumstances. (7) Three of the hearing requests object to the manner in which the proposaldifferentiates between ``qualified persons'' and ``unqualified persons.''(The term ``qualified person'' is currently defined in existing andSection;1910.399.) The Edison Electric Institute (Exhibit 4-10), the InternationalBrotherhood of Teamsters (Exhibit 4-26), and the National Arborists Association(Exhibit 4-30) are concerned that the definition, in conjunction with thetraining requirements proposed in andSection; 1910.332, is vague and wouldpose enforcement and compliance problems. OSHA requests public commenton how the standard could be changed to make the definition of ``qualifiedperson'' more clear and the standard more enforceable.(8) The Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (Exhibit 4-44) objectsto OSHA's use of data that covers only an 18-month period and is over tenyears old. OSHA is planning to submit additional accident data at the hearingand invites the public to submit electrical accident information as well.(9) The International Brotherhood of Teamsters (Exhibit 4-26) suggeststhat recommendations contained in the National Institute for OccupationalSafety and Health's (NIOSH) December 1986 Alert, <T3>Request for Assistance in Preventing Fatalities of Workers Who ContactElectrical Energy, </T3>be included in the standard. The hearing requestspecifically suggests adopting NIOSH's recommendations on the institutionof a ``buddy system'' and on training for emergencies (including medicaltraining). OSHA requests comments on whether or not such provisions shouldbe included in the standard. (10) The International Brotherhood of Teamsters (Exhibit 4-26) also objectsto the proposal's differences from NFPA 70E, the national consensus standardthat covers electrical safety work practices. In view of this objection,OSHA invites public comment on whether or not the standard as proposedwould be more effective in protecting employees from electrical hazardsthan NFPA 70E and on how the differences from NFPA 70E affect employeesafety. (11) Two of the hearing requests (Exhibits 4-10 and 4-45) also containcomments on numerous provisions contained in the proposal. OSHA invitesadditional public comment on any of the requirements contained in the proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Participation </ITAG>Under section 6(b)(3) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and 29CFR Part 1911, an opportunity to testify orally concerning the issues raisedin this notice will be provided at an informal public hearing, which willbegin on Tuesday, August 9, 1988, in Washington, DC. <T3>Notice of Intention to Appear at Hearing. </T3>All persons desiringto participate at the hearing, including those who previously requestedthat a public hearing be held, must file a notice of intention to appearwith Mr. Tom Hall, OSHA Division of Consumer Affairs, Room N-3647, 200Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210.
