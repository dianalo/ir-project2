I have consistently stated before Congress and on many other occasions that the default problem is, in large part, an issue that all institutions of higher education must confront. To help historically black colleges in this task, the Department of Education will conduct workshops and seminars to assist those with high default rates in managing student loans. We believe that the default problem that exists at some black colleges thus will be greatly alleviated.    Bruce Carnes   Deputy Undersecretary   Department of Education   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
