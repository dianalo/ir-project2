Apcar (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FRB WNEWS </CO><IN> BNK </IN><DATELINE> DALLAS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Faced with an estimated first-quarter loss of $1.5 billion at First RepublicBank Corp., Gerald W. Fronterhouse quit as chairman and chief executive officer of the bank holding company after requests by bank regulators.    The regulators named former American Airlines Chairman Albert V. Casey to succeed Mr. Fronterhouse.    The estimated first-quarter loss is as much as three times wider than what officials and regulators had been projecting in recent weeks. It also confirmed in the minds of federal bank regulators that First RepublicBank's financial condition is far worse than anyone had known and that Mr. Fronterhouse had to go.    The executive change, which was first proposed last weekend, came as federal bank examiners concluded a detailed, two-month review of Texas's biggest banking corporation last week. After that exam, the bank was ordered to mark down drastically some loans and write off several others linked primarily to real estate lendings in the Southwest.    Last month, First RepublicBank turned to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. for what may be the largest bank bailout in history. The FDIC injected $1 billion to rescue First RepublicBank's Houston and Dallas banks and is casting about for a way to recapitalize the financial institution. The examination of First RepublicBank had been previously scheduled and wasn't related to the bank's bailout request.    All told, First RepublicBank estimates that it will have increased its loan-loss provision by $1.5 billion for the quarter, including $231 million for loans to less-developed countries. Significantly, regulators insisted that First RepublicBank boost its loss allowance for foreign lendings to 50% from about 30% at year end, a step that several money-center banks had declined to take last year.    First RepublicBank said it expects to report its first-quarter results next week. In the year-earlier quarter, RepublicBank Corp., the forerunner to First RepublicBank, earned $10.4 million, or 30 cents a share.    A $1.5 billion first-quarter loss would be the second largest deficit in banking history dwarfed only by the record $2.59 billion loss set by Citicorp in last year's second quarter after the big New York banking company provided for huge foreign-loan losses. Prior to the Citicorp move, the largest quarterly bank loss was Continental Illinois Corp.'s $1.1 billion loss in the 1984 second quarter when it was in the midst of a similar federal rescue.    Over the weekend, Robert L. Clarke, comptroller of the currency, and other bank regulators met with Mr. Fronterhouse to seek his resignation. Mr. Clarke said that Mr. Fronterhouse told them that he had decided to step down in light of the results of the examination.    In addition to the resignation of Mr. Fronterhouse, regulators said they removed James D. Berry and H.R. &quot;Bum&quot; Bright from the executive committee of First RepublicBank's board. Mr. Berry is a retired chairman of RepublicBank Corp., and Mr. Bright is an influential director and major shareholder who is prominent in Dallas business circles.    Messrs. Berry and Bright, however, will continue to serve as directors.    The selection of Mr. Casey, the 68-year-old, retired chairman of American Airlines and its parent, AMR Corp., and a former postmaster general, isn't unlike a step taken in the federal bailout of Continental Illinois in 1984. In that case, regulators installed John Swearingen, the retired chief of Standard Oil Co. of Indiana, the predecessor to Amoco Corp. Mr. Swearingen, though, stayed on for several years; Mr. Casey is a self-described interim banker. &quot;At my age I'd be interim in any case,&quot; he joked yesterday at a news conference. Besides, he added, his sole experience as a banker is &quot;as a borrower.&quot;    Over the years, Mr. Casey has earned a reputation for shaping management teams at big companies. The team he formed at American is considered one of the best in the airline industry. Mr. Casey also served as president of Times Mirror Co., the Los Angeles-based publisher.    The FDIC said it didn't impose Mr. Casey on the board of First RepublicBank, though it is clear the directors ratified his selection by federal regulators. The FDIC said Mr. Casey is well known to federal-bank regulators, including Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, and that he is expected to &quot;provide strong and credible leadership to First RepublicBank.&quot;    The management shake-up caps the brief and controversial reign of Mr. Fronterhouse, 51, who gambled his bank and career on last year's ill-fated combination of Dallas's troubled InterFirst Corp. and the former RepublicBank Corp. The combination was supposed to make First RepublicBank Texas's dominant financial institution; instead, its $24.1 billion loan portfolio has withered in the state's hard-scrabble economy. At year end, it had nearly $4 billion in non-performing loans, or nearly 16% of its $33.2 billion in assets.    Mr. Fronterhouse met for the final time with the First RepublicBank board yesterday, but then he left the bank and was unable to be reached for comment.    First RepublicBank isn't related to San Francisco-based First Republic Bancorp.    In recent months, several top First RepublicBank executives have departed, leaving Mr. Fronterhouse and Joseph R. Musolino, who was named president less than three weeks ago, as the last of the six-man management team forged by the merger. Some, including Robert H. Stewart III, the former InterFirst chief, never intended to stay. Others chafed under the formal Mr. Fronterhouse, who, they reportedly believed, was consolidating power among his former RepublicBank colleagues.    It's uncertain what Mr. Musolino's role will be as the last remaining member of the original cast. He had been directing the bank's efforts to dispose of or restructure problem real estate loans. Mr. Casey said &quot;it is much too early&quot; to discuss management changes, but he conceded, &quot;there's very little upper management left.&quot; Late yesterday, Mr. Musolino was unavailable for comment.    Under Mr. Fronterhouse, the company apparently was obsessed with molding the InterFirst-RepublicBank combination, to the point that other critical business functions were neglected. Late last year, for example, the company updated appraisals on its real estate loans and found that many of them had deteriorated more severely than expected. That discovery propelled First RepublicBank to a record $656.8 million loss in 1987.    During most of the year, Mr. Fronterhouse and his team focused on consolidating departments in the bank to wring efficiencies and cost savings. That set off a long round of internal maneuverings within the institution as executives vied for jobs and turf. Some 2,100 jobs were eliminated including some by layoff.    Mr. Fronterhouse frequently boasted of the corporation's ability to show an operating profit each quarter prior to loan-loss provisions. But the erosion of the lending portfolio and the huge quarterly losses kept eating away First RepublicBank's capital.    At yesterday's news conference, the effusive Mr. Casey seemed untroubled by First RepublicBank's serious financial straits. &quot;This is all good news,&quot; he said. &quot;We're going to have fun.&quot;    But the former airline executive conceded that he doesn't yet have a plan for the banking concern. He said regulators had approached him about the job only last Saturday.    Mr. Casey faces a daunting task. As a result of the estimated $1.5 billion net loss, negative common shareholder's equity has reached about $688 million. That means that any federal bailout of the bank would require several billion dollars of aid, probably exceeding the record $4.5 billion rescue of Continental Illinois. Mr. Casey seemed unfazed by the deficit. &quot;That's just a mere statistic of a historical number on a balance sheet,&quot; he said.    Mr. Clarke, the comptroller, said First RepublicBank had a substantial loan-loss allowance at year end of $1.25 billion. That allowance could have grown to as much as $2.75 billion in the first quarter, depending on what loan amounts First RepublicBank decided to write off.    The announcement was made after the close of trading. First RepublicBank common stock fell 12.5 cents to close at $1.25 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.    ---   Karen Blumenthal contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
