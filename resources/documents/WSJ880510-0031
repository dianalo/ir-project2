Toronto-based FCMI said it also filed a class-action suit in Delaware Chancery Court seeking an injunction against the proposed acquisition.    Henry Fenig, executive vice president of FCMI, said the holding company believes Servo is &quot;worth more&quot; than the $14.10 a share, or about $10 million, agreed by Servo and the group, which includes Stephen Barre, Servo's president and chief executive officer.    FCMI said it and affiliates own 5.7% of Servo, a Hicksville, N.Y., company that designs and makes electronic equipment and parts. FCMI added that currently it intends to raise its stake to as much as 10% of Servo's shares outstanding, and reserves the right to increase the stake above 10%. Servo executives weren't available for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
