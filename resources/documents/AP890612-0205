In fact, some would say thisseaside suburb of Los Angeles, which enjoyed a brief boom as an oiltown, is downright seedy. But if you're looking for colorfulcharacters from the counterculture, you need look no farther.</TEXT><TEXT/><NOTE>By RIC LEYVA</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   California-bound tourists tired of Disneylandand Hollywood have an offbeat alternative in Venice, the funky beachtown where everyday sights include a minstrel on roller skates andwilting flower children reading tarot cards.   Patterned after its Italian namesake and featuring a fewsurviving canals, the one-time center of Prohibition-era speak-easynight life was adopted by Beat Generation poets before hippies madeit their Southern California crash pad.   It is the home to fabled Muscle Beach and remains acounterculture haven for 1960s-style peace protesters, New Agehealers, artists, roller skaters, surfers and scores of streetperformers. Acts range from a chain-saw tossing juggler to a limbodancer prancing on a bed of broken glass.   ``This is America we come to see,'' says Ingrid Nilsson, 22, ofSweden. ``We can wear bikinis and go shopping.''   Competing for tourist dollars along bustling Ocean Front Walk arepeddlers offering rock crystals touted for their alleged healingpowers, tie-dyed clothing and handmade jewelry sold on card tables.Storefront merchants sell souvenir T-shirts, sunglasses and hats.   Sprinkled among the vendors are aging hippie fortunetellers,peace activists selling bumper stickers and buttons, caricatureartists and masseuses, including one who offers a standing massagewithin a wood-pole pyramid topped with aluminum foil.   Vivid, sometimes startling wall murals appear anonymouslyovernight, only to be plastered with colorful gang graffiti withindays.   Out-of-town visitors mingle at sidewalk cafes withespresso-sipping Bohemians sporting ponytails and wearing tatteredjeans. Strollers meander through clouds of incense, chantingBuddhists, naked toddlers and pungent smoke wafting from marijuanajoints puffed in the open.   Cops walking their beats in short pants occasionally draw nearundetected and move in to make a collar.   Hungry visitors choose between take-out meals ranging fromvegetarian fast-food to New York-style pizza as they watch daredevilroller skaters jump hurdles or an elderly thrill-seeker known asSkateboard Mama weave through a slalom course marked by empty cups.   Venice's eclectic allure has drawn such celebrity residents asCharlie Chaplin, the late rock 'n' roll star Jim Morrison,science-fiction author Ray Bradbury, actor-director Dennis Hopperand actress Lisa Bonet of ``The Cosby Show.''   Sometimes called Los Angeles' ``Slum by the Sea,'' Venice issandwiched between upscale, rent-controlled Santa Monica to thenorth and the yachting yuppie enclave of Marina del Rey to the south.   Venice's liberal reputation draws hundreds of homeless people andteen-age runaways to its alleyways, in addition to muscle-boundbodybuilders, skinhead punk rockers, nude sunbathers and hordes oftourists.   It also has its share of run-down neighborhoods populated byviolent street gangs, drug dealers, prostitutes and``strawberries,'' the slang name given to streetwalkers who sellthemselves in exchange for drugs.   ``People who don't fit in anywhere else find a home here, even ifit's only for a week or a night _ or an hour,'' says Oscar, abedraggled blues singer who declined to give his last name.   ``Got me a little angel. I love the way she spreads her wings,''Oscar croons, a grimy cap set on the ground to receive donationsfrom appreciative passersby.   Another Venice street minstrel, who has become something of arolling landmark, is Harry Parry, a costumed guitar player whoskates among the tourists every day, pausing to serenade anyonewilling to listen.   ``This beach is an oasis of light in a pool of darkness _ wherewe can all be who we are,'' says Parry, who covers his massivedreadlock hairdo in a makeshift turban and wears baseball shinguards over his flowing robes as part of his distinctive outfit.   His skates are remnants of the 1970s, when Venice became theSouthern California center for disco roller-skating. Skaters stillflock to Venice, including one known as Tex who rolls on18-inch-tall stilt skates mounted to his cowboy boots.   Venice was created soon after the turn of the century on 160acres about 15 miles west of downtown Los Angeles by tobaccomillionaire Abbot Kinney, who envisioned a stately cultural centerserviced by an array of canals.   He imported singing gondoliers from Italy to operate a flotillaof authentic Venetian gondolas and officially opened the newcommunity on July 4, 1905. Attractions included a carnival pier anda miniature railroad.   Kinney's highbrow dreams of a fine arts center fizzled. Developedinstead were bawdy vaudeville acts, gin joints, gambling dens andfreak shows.   Its main daytime attraction was a covered bathhouse that featuredheated sea water and 600 private dressing rooms for modest bathers.   Actress Sarah Bernhardt performed at the 3,400-seat VeniceAuditorium in 1906 and reportedly made 20 curtain calls during threesold-out shows, but few other celebrities of note came to Veniceother than to gamble or sample the racy night life.   Perhaps the first person to ride the surf at Venice was Olympicswimmer Duke Kahanamoku, a Hawaiian native considered to be thefather of modern wave riding. Historians report he rode a redwoodsurfboard near the popular pier in the first decade of the 20thcentury.   Most of the original canals were filled in during the 1930s andnot long afterward Venice became an oil boom town dotted withderricks which were dismantled later when the crude dried up.   Venice is to beach towns what Berkeley is to college towns, andfueling its diverse, avant-garde image are chic art galleries,trendy coffeehouses and pricey restaurants.   Further contrasts are provided by fortress-like remodeled homessurrounded by fences topped with razor-sharp barbed wire that standalongside dilapidated seaside cottages, some occupied by severalfamilies.   Prominent in the gentrification of Venice is 72 Market Street, adinner house opened by Tony Bill, producer of such films as``Shampoo'' and ``The Sting,'' with the help of investors such asactor Dudley Moore, who occasionally drops in to play the piano.   Topping a long list of serious art sellers in Venice is the L.A.Louver Gallery, which introduced internationally renowned painterDavid Hockney to Southern California.   A popular gathering spot to see and be seen over espresso andcroissants is the Rose Cafe, where aspiring actors read scriptsbefore auditions, writers scribble in notebooks and occasionally aworking actor like Gary Busey stops in for a bite.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 25</NOTE></DOC>
