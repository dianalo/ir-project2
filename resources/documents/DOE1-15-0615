For example,consider the problem of assigning persons to jobs where each assignmentutilizes at least two scarce resources, and the resource utilizationis dependent on the person and the type of task. A practical situationwhere the above might occur is a slaughter house where the ''cutters''are assigned to different cut patterns. In this case the resources arethe time, the cost and the productivity measured in terms of qualityand amount of the end products. In this paper the resource constrainedassignment problem is studied, and several classes of valid inequalitiesbased on the properties of the knapsack and assignment polytypes arederived. An algorithm is presented that uses both the linear programmingand the Langrangean relaxation of the original problem in order to solvethe separation problem. Some computational experiments are also given.10 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
