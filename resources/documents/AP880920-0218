Preparations for relocating the supersonic F16 jets and crews ofthe U.S. 441st Air Tactical Wing from Torrejon air base outsideMadrid to Italy ``are going very smoothly'' said AssistantSecretary of State Rozanne Ridgway.   Spain insisted on removal of the 441st unit from thehigh-profile Torrejon base early in the current talks which,however will provide for U.S. air and naval forces to continueusing other Spanish installations.   Testifying before the House subcommittee on European and MiddleEastern affairs, Ms. Ridgway gave few details of the basenegotiations, suspended in mid-summer and expected to resume soon.But Ambassador Reginald Bartholemew, the chief U.S. negotiator hasjust returned to Madrid, she said.   ``Both governments wish to get this agreement behind us,'' shesaid. ``We remain hopeful that a basis for settling the fewremaining issues can be reached soon.''   Ms. Ridgway said Spain will not contribute to the estimated $500million construction costs NATO will pay for the U.S. unit's newfacilities in Italy, and under the new base agreement will notreceive U.S. military aid.   U.S. budget austerity last year reduced American aid to Spain toslightly over $100 million, down from $403 million in militarycredits and grants annually pledged in an expiring five-yearagremeent between the two countries.   Asked if the new arrangement would be consistent with Spain'srole in NATO, Ms. Ridgway replied: ``Spain has defined its role inthe alliance as it deems appropriate for Spain. ... I think that,while we might wish for more, the Spanish are very clear about whatis possible, and that is what we are working on,'' she added.   Meanwhile, another alliance member, Portugal recently restatedto a Pentagon-State Department team its concern about declininglevels of U.S. military aid but declared it intends to continueproviding U.S. access to Lajes air base in the Azores Islands, Ms.Ridgway said.   The U.S. delegation in Lisbon ``had some good talks'' duringconsultations on broadening bilateral cooperation, she said.Another round of talks is expected in October, she added.   The Portuguese government voiced concern last March that currentU.S. aid of $117 million is little more than half the 1985 level.</TEXT></DOC>
