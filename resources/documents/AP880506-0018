By a 385-23 vote Thursday, the House adopted a measure orderingthe president to ``deploy equipment and personnel of the ArmedForces sufficient to halt the unlawful penetration of United Statesborders by aircraft and vessels carrying narcotics.''   The House passed similar anti-drug amendments in 1985 and 1986,but they were later eliminated by conference committees. Among theobstacles this time around is opposition from Defense SecretaryFrank C. Carlucci.   ``That is not a function of the military,'' Carlucci said in aninterview earlier this year. ``We are not the front-line agency inthe war on drugs.''   Carlucci was interviewed after Education Secretary WilliamBennett had raised the possbility in a speech.   House members admitted Thursday that the amendment hasshortcomings. ``Yes, it is flawed,'' said Rep. Jack Davis, R-Ill.   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed ServicesCommittee, agreed. ``This thing has serious problems,'' he said.   Aspin had proposed adding $350 million to the bill for the CoastGuard, which has cut anti-drug patrols by 55 percent because ofbudget problems.   The money would be used to pay for more Coast Guard patrols,along with buying six more patrol helicopters, six patrol boats,and a pair of radar aircraft to track smugglers.   Davis and other Republicans raised the total to $475 million andadded the amendment ordering the military to seal American borders.   The House also voted Thursday to spend $600 million for researchinto the single-warhead Midgetman weapon that the Reaganadministration wants to kill.   ``The message here is that there is a lot of support forMidgetman,'' said Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., speaking shortly beforethe 231-171 vote.   AuCoin's plan proposes only $100 million for the railroad-basedversion of the 10-warhead MX. President Reagan wants 50 of thosemissiles to go with 50 more MX weapons that will be put intoland-based silos.   Reagan had sought only $200 million for the Midgetman and $793million for the rail-based MX.   The Senate will begin work next week on its version of thePentagon budget, and that measure proposes only $50 million forMidgetman and $700 million for MX. Differences between the twobills will be worked out by a House-Senate conference committee.   In addition to being opposed by the Reagan administration, theMidgetman is also opposed by both active candidates for theDemocratic presidential nomination _ Michael Dukakis and JesseJackson.   But ``candidates can change their mind,'' Aspin said. He notedthat Reagan originally opposed basing the MX on railroads, but nowsupports that plan.   The dispute involves a successor to the aging Minuteman as theheart of America's land-based nuclear deterrent, a triad which alsoincludes submarine-launched missiles and bombers.   Supporters of the MX say it has already been developed and wouldbe much cheaper to simply build 50 more and put them on railroads.But Midgetman backers contend the MX is vulnerable to a Sovietfirst strike and nuclear stability would be improved by building aweapon that has fewer warheads and thus is less attractive as atarget.   In another defense issue, Carlucci said congressional demandsthat America's allies pay more for defense are misguided and amountto a ``high-stakes game of `chicken''' that the United States can'tafford to play.   Carlucci, addressing the Foreign Policy Association in New YorkCity, said recent attacks in Congress on NATO and other allies likeJapan and South Korea suggest ``a growing inclination towardsisolationism _ a kind of withdrawal syndrome from our internationalobligations and interests.''</TEXT></DOC>
