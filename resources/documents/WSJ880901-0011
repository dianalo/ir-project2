Comments from bank officials, which came after most Tokyo markets were closed, sent the dollar to a 1988 high against the yen in Tokyo at 136.75 and pushed Japanese government bond prices down sharply.    The reaction could force the central bank into an embarrassingly quick reversal, analysts said.    &quot;It's crazy,&quot; said Minoru Yoshida, head of Citibank's foreign exchange and bond-trading operations in Tokyo. &quot;Now they may have to change policy.&quot;    The dollar continued to hold its ground early Thursday in Tokyo, with no sign of intervention in the foreign-exchange markets by the Bank of Japan. At the close of morning trading, the dollar was quoted at 136.60 yen.    Share prices were sharply lower on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Thursday morning. At the close of the morning session, the Nikkei Index, an average of 225 stocks, was down 597.80 points, or 2.2%, at 26768.15. It had dropped as much as 664 points during the morning. The index came back up in the last 15 minutes of morning trading. Volume was light.    An analyst with a foreign brokerage house said that the morning's sharp decline &quot;was a reaction one would have expected with the {Bank of Japan} allowing rates to rise.&quot; However, she said that despite the sell-off, most of the long-term investors she had spoken to during the morning weren't heavily concerned. &quot;Most people are sitting and waiting for the cheap buys,&quot; she said.    The Japanese stock market has far outstripped the world's other major markets since last October's crash, and some analysts consider it very vulnerable to a big decline in the yen.    Later in the day in Tokyo, Bank of Japan officials said they would consider taking action, if necessary, to stem the yen's fall. They didn't specify what that action would be, but other central banks recently have resorted to large-scale market intervention to protect their currencies against the creeping strength of the dollar.    Last week, seven European nations followed an Aug. 9 U.S. discount rate increase by raising their interest rates, fighting inflation and supporting their currencies at the same time. A Bank of Japan official insisted then that there was &quot;absolutely no need&quot; for Japanese rates to follow.    The central bank did step into the interbank money markets Thursday, however, allowing rates on short-term bills to rise 1/16 percentage point. The one-month bill discount rate, the amount financial institutions charge each other for one-month loans, climbed to 4.25%, its second 1/16 point increase this week. Rates on two-month and three-month bills climbed to 4.1875% and 4.125%, respectively.    The inverted yield curve, in which short-term borrowings are more costly than long-term money, is a seasonal event in Japan, and usually coincides with the September end of many insitutions' fiscal years. Demand for interim, short-term funding usually is higher as institutions seek to close their books.    Traders said the increase in the interbank rates helped to cool volatile money markets. &quot;Prices are coming off,&quot; said Takashi Miyasaka, head of bond trading at Jardine Fleming Japan Ltd. He said pressure on the Bank of Japan to raise its official discount rate had also eased.    But he cautioned that if the dollar-yen rate were to rise into a new trading range of, say, 138 yen to 140 yen, up from its range over the past month of between 130 yen and 134 yen, the Bank of Japan would almost certainly be forced to act. &quot;The problem is still the yen,&quot; he said.    Yesterday's bond and yen sell-off in Japan occurred after central bank officials told local reporters the bank was sticking to that position. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Japan's stance is consistent with the Louvre agreement on exchange rates by the leading industrial nations.    Yesterday's statements triggered an almost immediate collapse in the value of the yen on international markets, spurring huge sell orders in after-hours, broker-to-broker Japanese bond trading as well. The dollar, which had closed in Tokyo at 134.97 yen, reached the 136.75-yen level there before most trading shifted to Europe. At the end of trading in New York, the U.S. currency was quoted at 136.53 yen. The yield on Japan's benchmark No. 105 government bond jumped to 5.45%, up from 5.38% at the opening in Tokyo.    Trading in Japanese stocks already was halted for the day, but many analysts predicted a major sell-off today if the yen remains weak.    In London, center of most of Europe's Japanese equities trading, the stock exchange's index of 50 Japanese blue-chip stocks opened 10 points lower than its Tokyo close. As the yen weakened throughout the European morning, investors and dealers fled Japanese electronic and other blue-chip issues.    By London's close, the index had fallen nearly 1.4%, off 24.09 points at 1763.15.    Traded in the U.S. as American depositary receipts, Japanese stocks were also among the biggest losers on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.    &quot;There was a very sharp reaction to the statement about the discount rate,&quot; said Mark Cliffe, international economist at Nomura Research Institute in London. &quot;With {Tokyo's} remarkable performance, people are rather concerned about how exposed it might be to some sort of setback.&quot; Yesterday's fall in the yen was &quot;the immediate preoccupation of equity markets.&quot;    The slide in Japanese equity prices reflects how the global market increasingly interconnects and feeds itself. &quot;To the extent Japanese stock markets can move significantly when most of Tokyo is in bed indicates we are in a global equities marketplace,&quot; said Mr. Cliffe.    The declines spread to the Euromarkets, noted Masanaga Kono, Japanese equity salesman at Yamaichi Securities Co. in London, as traders sharply marked down the prices of some Japanese equity warrant issues. &quot;It was quite a big movement,&quot; he said, exacerbated by thin trading volumes.    Richard Read, head of Japanese equity sales and trading at Salomon Brothers in London, described the European fall as a &quot;knee-jerk&quot; reaction to the likelihood of widening interest rate differentials between Japan and other industrial nations. &quot;The market is sensitive to currencies,&quot; he said.    Mr. Read cautioned that non-domestic investors still account for only a small amount of Japanese equity volume, and thus Tokyo could rebound today from the declines in Europe. &quot;If the domestic market decides to do something different the tone can be extremely different,&quot; he said.    Not everybody blamed the Bank of Japan officials for yesterday's sell-off. A yen-bond trader for a U.S. firm in Tokyo said selling by short-term speculators was behind the sudden fall in the yen and in the Japanese government bond market. &quot;The big players weren't selling, it was just a few short-term sellers moving on the market's weakness,&quot; he said. He added that rather than a major sell-off, there was simply a lack of buying interest.    But he said the sudden drop increases pressure on the Bank of Japan to raise the official discount rate, the amount the bank charges on loans to financial institutions. He predicted that the central bank will intervene somewhere within 24 hours. &quot;There's a sense of urgency in the market,&quot; he said.    The turmoil could force the Bank of Japan to rethink its stance because most of Japan's imports are denominated in dollars, and a steep fall in the yen could ignite inflation in Japan. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa has said rising prices are the government's chief consideration in credit policy decisions.    While inflation is a threat in most Western industrial countries, so far it is largely absent in Japan. Consumer prices this year are up less than 1% from the previous year, and wholesale prices are down.    Japan's discount rate has stood at a post-World War II low of 2.5% since February 1987, while in the past two months, the U.S. and most Western European governments have raised official lending rates.    &quot;People see a widening yield gap between Japan and other countries,&quot; said Marshall Gittler, a bond market analyst at UBS-Phillips andamp; Drew International Ltd.    It was the perception that the differential could persist that triggered the torrent of selling. </TEXT></DOC>
