Mr. Bastanzio, grand wizard of the Florida chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, is among a growing number of white supremacists turning to public-access cable TV stations to spread their views. Although his program has yet to air, it has already inflamed debate over some unforeseen pitfalls of community broadcasting. The central issue: whether communities or cable companies can do anything to restrict what runs on public access channels.    Over the past decade, about 1,500 communities across the country have set up public access stations as part of their franchise agreements with cable operators. In general, the stations are required to offer air time and production facilities for free to anyone who asks. &quot;The idea was that with all the channels cable provides, some should be set aside to provide a forum where people of ordinary means could speak their piece,&quot; says Matthew Leibowitz, a Miami media lawyer.    That has usually meant a lot of grainy footage about voter registration, psychic call-in shows and an occasional soft-core sex show. But a few years ago, California white supremacist leader Tom Metzger began producing and distributing a public access program called &quot;Race and Reason,&quot; which argued for racial separatism and discussed such perceived threats as the &quot;kosherization&quot; of the world's food supply. Now, public access specialists say, hate groups from the Klan to neo-Nazi skinheads are picking up on the tactic to promote their ideas and recruit members.    In the Cincinnati suburb of Norwood, for example, a group of young skinheads recently broadcast the message &quot;Join the American Nazis&quot; over a local public access TV bulletin board. Pocatello, Idaho's public access station has aired interviews with Georgia white supremacist J.B. Stoner.    Critics haven't been able to do much about such shows. Mr. Bastanzio's &quot;Florida Klan News&quot; shows hooded Klansmen in the glow of a fiery cross, and sprinkles racial slurs throughout. Gregory Grant, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Orlando, says airing the program will &quot;set race relations here back 100 years.&quot;    Though the issue has never been considered by courts, most experts agree that the supremacists' programming is protected by the First Amendment. Federal law bans only sexual obscenity. &quot;It's a murky area, but as long as the Klan follows the rules and doesn't get involved with nudity and sexuality, there's no way to prohibit (its shows),&quot; says Mr. Leibowitz, the Miami attorney.    No ratings exist for such public access shows, but their viewership is considered negligible by public access specialists.    Unable to block supremacists's shows, most communities have settled for producing &quot;counter-programming&quot; in which local leaders take to the public access channel to rebut the racists. But last month, the city council in Kansas City, Mo., voted to do away with its public access station altogether rather than air shows by the Missouri Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.    Reaction to that shows how muddled the issue has become. Some proponents of public access TV have howled almost as loudly as the Klan, fearing that other communities now might close off public access, too. The American Civil Liberties Union has vowed to sue on behalf of the Klansmen, citing free speech.    Some public access specialists say the best way for a community to deal with supremacist programming is simply to run it with as little fuss as possible. Tomas Cantrell, head of the public access station in Houston, says a Texas Klan group aired one program on the station in 1987, drew almost no response and hasn't been heard from since. </TEXT></DOC>
