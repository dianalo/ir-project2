It was only the latest episode in a long history of bank involvement in the affairs of West German companies. Earlier in the summer, it appeared that Deutsche Bank was about to topple Carl H. Hahn, the chairman of Volkswagen AG. Last year, Deutsche Bank purchased and dismantled the huge Flick industrial concern. And in 1983, the supervisory board chairman of Commerzbank AG engineered a reorganization of the Guttehofnungshuette Aktienverein machinery group and its MAN AG truck unit.    In West Germany, the banks shape the business and industrial landscape. They hold the power to make or break executives' careers, mergers, the companies themselves. And though they have come under increasing attack from politicians, antitrust officials, consumer groups and foreign bankers, who all argue their influence is too pervasive and stifles business growth, the banks seem likely to maintain their grip on the levers that move West Germany's corporate world.    For, deep down, Germans appear to take comfort in a powerful banking establishment. To many, the system represents security, a deeply rooted value in the German psyche. And some analysts believe the concentrated might of West Germany's banks has helped make their country the economic powerhouse of Europe.    &quot;The Japanese guide their industrial policy through their MITI trade ministry, the Americans do it through Pentagon subsidies, and West Germany (does it) through the Deutsche Bank,&quot; says Wolfgang Roth, an advocate of bank reform and the opposition Social Democratic Party's economic policy expert in parliament.    Moreover, successive governments have benefited too much from the banks' clout for politicians to press hard for change. The Economics Ministry, reacting to pressure from the Common Market Commission in Brussels, has drawn up a proposal that would end banks' exemption from antitrust law. But the motion is shaping up as a token gesture.    The Federation of German Banks is willing to play along. The powerful trade group says it can accept repeal of the exemption, contained in paragraph 102 of the Cartel Act, but only if banks don't have to change the way they do business.    &quot;We won't cling to paragraph 102 provided its elements which we consider indispensable are still available to us elsewhere in law,&quot; says Wolfgang Roeller, chairman of Dresdner Bank AG and current president of the federation. He then proceeds to list as indispensable all the principal elements of the provision.    In any case, eliminating that exemption &quot;barely scratches the surface,&quot; says Lothar Schulte, a legal expert sitting on the government's Public Monopolies Commission. The true source of the banks' power, he says, remains their huge but murky networks of equity holdings, external board seats and political contacts.    The monopolies commission has proposed limiting bank stockholdings in individual industrial companies to 5% and curbing the number of outside directorships an individual bank officer can hold. In the case of Deutsche Bank, executives occupy seats on the boards of 39 of West Germany's top 100 companies. In many instances, the same banker sits on the boards of rival firms.    Unlike many Western countries, Germany doesn't restrict its banks' financial activities. Accordingly, the bigger ones have evolved into &quot;universal&quot; financial institutions, offering a full range of services, including retail and commercial banking, investment banking, leasing and consulting. They give &quot;recommendations&quot; for proxy votes at annual meetings and also control venture capital, fund management and securities research.    But for many Germans, such bigness isn't necessarily bad. &quot;West Germans are fanatics about security after the periods of economic misery in our history,&quot; says Wolfgang Kartte, president of the Federal Cartel Office. &quot;Continuity with little risk is the bylaw of German bank customers, and the universal bank system offers that umbrella.&quot;    The banks have often put their vast resources at the government's disposal. Export credits for East Berlin or Moscow have been issued practically overnight to add luster to Ostpolitik, Bonn's policy of improving relations with the Soviet bloc. This summer, several major banks formed joint ventures with Moscow's foreign trade bank to help Bonn solidify economic ties with the Soviet Union. When going abroad to promote trade relations, Chancellor Helmut Kohl doesn't leave home without a senior banker in tow. His economic adviser is Deutsche Bank co-chairman Alfred Herrhausen, the architect of DaimlerBenz's management shake-up in July.    The banks also are there to help stave off industrial embarrassments. In 1982, for example, AEG AG, the electronics concern, was about to collapse under 5.5 billion marks ($3 billion) in debt, endangering 120,000 jobs. In response to a government plea, West German banks rushed out 2.8 billion marks in emergency credits, which were only partially guaranteed by the state. The loans were later converted into AEG equity that was resold to Daimler-Benz.    &quot;The one thing you have to say about our system is that a universal bank can give a company enormous support,&quot; says Albrecht Matuschka, head of one of West Germany's few independent financial services concerns.    But there is another side to that coin. &quot;If one or two of the big banks turn against you, you're dead,&quot; says Willy Korf, a maverick West German steel entrepreneur. Mr. Korf, who founded Korf Stahl AG, was considered an upstart newcomer who didn't fit into the conservative steel industry. The big banks shunned him. His small West German steel empire collapsed in 1983 after the banks and the Bonn government denied his pleas for credits.    &quot;Our banks are in a position to exert an inordinate influence on this country,&quot; says Mr. Roth of the Social Democratic Party, a leading advocate of bank reform. &quot;It's their right to use whatever laws they can. But it's our weakness as a parliament that we don't change anything.&quot;    For the banks, Deutsche Bank has taken up the defense of the status quo. It devoted an unusual eight-page opening essay in its 1986 annual report to rebut charges of abuses of power from &quot;irate critics.&quot; Management acknowledged the power of the banks but urged, &quot;Let us beware of jeopardizing a lively and animated society by stifling the spontaneous process of interaction between diverse power centers out of an irrational fear of abuse.&quot;    That is an argument that Mr. Kartte, the Federal Cartel Office president, doesn't buy. He fears West Germany is approaching something akin to an industrial oligarchy.    &quot;There is no reason why banks should have any industrial holdings whatsoever,&quot; he says. &quot;But if I were to summon up the courage to say we should do away with the universal banking system, most people would say I was crazy.&quot;    ---              German Banks' Corporate Involvement   Seats they hold on boards of top 100 German firms                             BY          BY          TOTAL                             OFFICERS    DIRECTORS    Deutsche Bank            39          20          59    Dresdner Bank            22          25          47    Commerzbank              15          15          30    Bayerische Vereinsbank   7            9          16    Westdeutsche Landesbank  6            1           7   Source: West German Public Monopolies Commission.</TEXT></DOC>
