PCSandM;HARDWAREandM;Backup andamp; Storage * Tape Backup Server * Emerald Systems * (619) 270 1994andM;Emerald Systems Corporation has introduced a LAN data management system thatprovides backup services for Novell's Advanced NetWare.andP;  The system, claimsEmerald, is the networking industry's first tape backup server system.andM;The system operates with Emerald Systems' VAST Device, the 2.2Gb tape backupsubsystem, and acts as a value added processor, allowing users access to LANdata regardless of the size of their network.andM;Emerald says that as a LAN system grows, users tend to take responsibilityfor their own network data.andP;  And since much of this data is on local disks,it's often excluded from routine system backups.andP;  However, with the TapeBackup Server system, any user can initiate a backup of a local workgroup toa single 8mm tape.andM;Although the Tape Backup Server system decentralizes the backup function, thesystem administrator can still backup all fileservers and local files.andP;  Also,with 2.2Gb of storage capacity most networks can be backed up onto a singletape.andP;  * 9,490 pounds sterling Fast Facts: 300andM;Communications * Knowledge Net II * Applied Knowledge Ltd * (0422) 330573andM;Knowledge Net II is a low-cost LAN board designed for the small office whereusers share information and disk facilities.andM;Fully PC-compatible, Knowledge Net II allows users to access programs, data,and peripherals with the same ease as if they were local units, claims theauthor.andP;  PCs are connected using a pair of twisted cables via their serialports.andM;Knowledge Net II, which also supports NETBIOS, is also said to be able tohandle the file and record locking that is required by the software.andP;  * 295pounds sterling Fast Facts: 299andM;Compatibles * 386SX Minstrel Workstation * HM Systems * (01) 209 0911andM;HM Systems has launched a new 386SX version of its Minstrel Workstation.andM;It includes all the features of the company's 286-based workstation, butenables users to take advantage of utilities such as Windows 386.andP;  Themachine also has an intelligent cacheing disk controller which sets out toimprove the disk performance.andM;HM systems is providing an upgrade to the 386SX version for people whoalready have the 286 model.andP;  This involves replacing the 286 board with an SXcard.andP;  * 2,487 pounds sterling Fast Facts: 297 * Ethernet Workstation *Future Computers * (01) 651 3541andM;A diskless IBM AT-compatible has been introduced by Future Computers toprovide a low-cost way of adding workstations to Novell NetWare, SFT and ELSLocal Area Networks.andM;Manufactured in the UK, the ethernet Workstation uses SMT technology, andmeasures just two inches high, approximately half the size of a conventionalunit.andP;  A 14-inch FST monochrome monitor is supplied as standard.andM;The unit is equipped with a 286 processor running at 12 MHz, 512Kb RAM(expandable to 4Mb on board), a Hercules graphics card and a parallel port.andO;EGA and VGA graphics, and a serial port are optional extras.andM;Since the machine is diskless, there is no opportunity to import or exportdata from the system.andP;  This, says Future Computers, offers a major benefit asthe network can be expanded without compromising security.andP;  * 1,350 poundssterling Fast Facts: 296 * Vision-100 * Ranger Computers * (0604) 791064andM;Ranger Computers has found a new use for the Sinclair Z88 portable computer:they have brought out software that turns it into a VT100-compatible dataterminal.andM;The terminal, which Ranger says emulates an extensive subset of the industrystandard VT100 terminal, is designed to meet the needs of rovingexperts--like engineers who need to access the office computer from thefield, or integrate with other computer-based equipmentandM;Unlike previous generations of portable terminals, which were based ondedicated hardware, the Vision-100 is cheaper and more reliable because it'sbeing mass produced.andM;The software provided has facilities for viewing any part of the 25 linescreen with the 8 line window.andP;  In addition, the pixel map is said to enableusers to see the layout of the whole screen.andP;  The software also includesscreen capture for later use and file transmit facilities.andM;Ranger Computers is selling a complete package, which includes a Z88,software, RAM pack and cables for around 375 pounds sterling.andP;  * 175 poundssterling Fast Facts: 295andM;Graphics adapters * STB VGA EM-16 * Technitron Data * (0753) 31292andM;Technitron Data is now selling an AT-bus and an MCA PS/2 Model 30-compatible,16-bit VGA adaptor called the STB VGA EM16.andP;  The half card provides fast,high resolution graphics suitable for CAD/CAM, DTP and similar applications.andM;According to Technitron, the card is up to five times faster than the IBM VGAgraphics card because of the 16-bit data interface.andP;  Other standardcomponents of the adaptor include 256kb on-board memory (expandable to512Kb), and compatibility with VGA, EGA, CGA, MDA, and Hercules displaystandards.andM;The product has software drivers for several popular packages, such aswindows, Lotus 1-2-3, Ventura and AutoCAD.andM;With both 15 and 9-pin connectors, the board can support analogue and digitalmonitors, as well as multi and fixed frequency.andP;  * From 310 pounds sterlingFast Facts: 293andM;Lasers * Adobe PostScript Interpreter * Schlumberger Technology * (0454)617777andM;Under a PostScript interpreter licensing agreement with Adobe Systems,Schlumberger Graphics has developed a controller which transforms its colourthermal-transfer printer/plotter, the 5232, into a colour output device forthe Adobe PostScript language.andM;Now, with the addition of the PostScript interpreter, the number of packagessupported by the printer/plotter -- which can also be used in multi-userenvironments -- has been extended to include Illustrator, Ventura andVersacad.andM;The PostScript Interpreter connects to all IBM or compatible PCs and PS/2susing an RS232 or Centronics port.andP;  * 17,250 pounds sterling Fast Facts: 292andM;Specialists Add-ons * Mouse with Pop-up DOS * Logitech (UK) * Tel: (0925)413501andM;This new mouse from Logitech could be ideal for those who work withhigh-resolution displays.andP;  The rodent apparently occupies a small desk spacebecause it has a high-resolution of 320dpi.andM;Two software packages are available with the mouse.andP;  One, called Pop-Up-DOS,provides an interface between DOS and the user as an alternative to thecommand-line based operating system.andM;The other program bundled with the mouse is Mouseware Utilities.andP;  Thisprovides over 30 pull-down menus for software applications, an interface forLotus 1-2-3, and a facility for creating your own mouse-based menus forkeyboard-based applications.andM;The mouse is available in serial or parallel bus versions for PCs equippedwith DOS, although the serial version can also run on PS/2 machines.andP;  * 95pounds sterling Fast Facts: 290andM;Local Area Networks * NetWare Access Server * Novell (UK) * (0344) 860400andM;Novell has introduced an access server for its Local Area Network system,NetWare.andP;  The single-dedicated server, based on a 386 AT-compatible, allowsup to fifteen users remote access to the NetWare LAN.andM;The access server software, which resides on the dedicated PC, providesmulti-tasking and multi-user capabilities to MS-DOS applications.andP;  It allowsmultiple remote PCs or Macintosh users to utilize applications on the LAN bydialing directly onto the network via an asynchronous modem.andM;The server software has additional security features for remote users.andP;  Theseinclude a dialback function which uses a directory residing on the server,and a call logging facility which records names and times to produce an audittrail of activity for the system supervisor.andP;  * 1,700 pounds sterling FastFacts: 289andM;Scanners * PC ScanMan * Logtech (UK) * (0925) 58039andM;Logitech has upgraded its hand-held scanner to give an adjustable resolutionof up to 400dpi, claimed to be almost pixel quality.andM;The hand-held scanner allows users of PCs or PS/2 machines to add graphics --including photographs and printed matter -- to their DTP or businesspublications.andM;The ScanMan features a scanning width of 102mm and ScanWare software,enabling users to add the scanned picture to their applications.andP;  Alsobundled with the scanner is the PaintShow graphics package; a program thatallows reversed or colour images to be edited in a number of ways.andP;  * 199pounds sterling Fast Facts: 288</TEXT></DOC>
