On other markets, grain and soybean futures fell; preciousmetals advanced; cattle prices rose and pork futures were mixed.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediatecrude settled unchanged to 54 cents higher with the contract fordelivery in June at $20.06 a barrel; heating oil was .07 cent to1.20 cents higher with June at 48.68 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was .80 cent to 2.56 cents higher with June at 67.28 centsa gallon.   June crude, which reached a recent high of $21.60 a barrel onApril 26, dropped below $20 on Monday.   Technical factors played a large role in Thursday's surge butthe Panamanian situation ``seemed to take on more importance as theday wore on,'' said Jerry Samuels, an analyst with Shearson LehmanHutton Inc. in New York.   Traders fear a military conflict in Panama could affect thedaily movement of 400,000 barrels of crude through the Panama Canal.   Unconfirmed reports that Bush planned to send troops to Panamacirculated during the trading session. After the close Bush said hewas sending about 2,000 troops and evacuating dependents to protectAmericans in the turmoil arising from a presidential election thatthe White House condemned as ``electoral theft'' by Gen. ManuelNoriega.   Soybean futures ended sharply lower on the Chicago Board ofTrade amid forecasts of rain and disappointment over thegovernment's reluctance to subsidize a sale of U.S. soybean oil tothe Soviet Union.   Wheat and corn futures also retreated.   The National Weather Service's new six-to-10-day outlook, issuedlate Wednesday, calls for rain next week in the central Plains andthe western Corn Belt, two areas that have not shared in thegeneral recovery from last summer's drought.   Soybean and corn futures also were pressured by expectations forshowers this weekend in the Midwest, analysts said.   Additional selling of soybean futures stemmed from AgricultureSecretary Clayton Yeutter's statement Thursday morning that theUSDA had not decided whether to subsidize the sale of U.S. soybeanoil to the Soviet Union. The market had expected a subsidized saleto be announced.   After the markets closed, the Agriculture Department issued areport estimating 1989 U.S. winter wheat production at a decade lowof 1.43 billion bushels.   The USDA's winter wheat estimate represented an 8 percent dropfrom last year's harvest of 1.56 billion bushels. The report wasexpected to prompt new buying of wheat futures on the Board ofTrade on Friday.   Wheat settled 1} cents lower to 1{ cents higher with thecontract for delivery in May at $4.28 a bushel; corn was 1{ centsto 3\ cents lower with May at $2.76\ a bushel; oats were 1{ centslower to { cent higher with May at $1.84{ a bushel; soybeans were6} cents to 10\ cents lower with May at $7.51{ a bushel.   The rise in oil prices spurred a moderate advance inprecious-metal prices, which tend to increase with signs of higherinflation.   Gold settled $2.30 to $3.30 higher with June at $382.10 a troyounce; silver was 3.8 cents to 4.8 cents higher with July at $5.735a troy ounce.   Most cattle futures ended slightly higher in light trading afterweakening earlier in the session. Pork futures settled mostly loweramid profit-taking after two days of steep gains.   Live cattle were .05 cent lower to .30 cent higher with June at72.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .28 centhigher with May at 77.15 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 centlower to .07 cent higher with June at 48 cents a pound; frozen porkbellies were .75 cent lower to .45 cent higher with May at 35.05cents a pound.</TEXT></DOC>
