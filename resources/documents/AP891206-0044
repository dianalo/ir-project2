Hundreds of foreigners grabbed theirluggage, walked out of their hotels and boarded buses today toescape the crossfire of a coup attempt.   ``We were just dying to get out, we were afraid that if they(the rebels) became desperate, they would get us,'' said MichelleNadela, 21, of Reno, Texas.   A truce between mutinous soldiers who held Manila's Makatifinancial district, where many hotels catering to foreigners arelocated, allowed hundreds to finally flee what had become the heartof the 5-day-old revolt.   When the cease-fire went into effect, they were told to packtheir bags and board government buses.   ``It was slick, it was a superb operation,'' said Crosby Nash,58, of Centreville, Md.   Throughout the morning, buses ferried hundreds of guests fromthe hotels to a duty-free shopping center 20 minutes away next tothe international airport. About 300 people immediately hoppedaboard the first available flights out of the country.   Among the people shuttled from the financial district by theDepartment of Tourism, including residents of Makati apartments,were at least 241 Americans. Natives of more than 40 othercountries, including Japan, Britain, Israel and even Peru, wereamong the 1,800 people rescued.   Officials said at least four foreigners remained in the area.   The evacuees were happy to have left behind some harrowingexperiences.   Briton Danny Chevin said he heard gunfire and saw tracersTuesday night coming from the roof of the Intercontinental Hotel,just above the room where he was staying.   ``I thought that if they (government troops) started firingback, it would come right at our windows,'' said Chevin, of London.   Chevin said he recorded the firefight on videotape, and otherguests also went away with Makati mementos.   Marion Auspitz of New York, for example, picked up a bulletfound next door to her room in the Manila Peninsula.   And Fanny Dickins, a British resident of Hong Kong, took apicture with a rebel leader before boarding the evacuation bus fromthe Intercontinental.   ``I found them all sympathetic, they were very nice andextremely polite, all of them,'' she said of the rebels.   Indeed, many of the foreigners had nothing but praise for themutineers who occupied the hotels.   ``They were being very professional about everything, theydidn't want to hurt us,'' said Chevin.   ``They did not treat us at any time as hostages,'' added RonKay, 39, of Atlanta.   Thomas Adkins of San Diego said rebels even served a breakfastof bacon and eggs to some of the Nikko Manila Garden hotel guestsSaturday morning.   The Manila Garden was the first hotel evacuated, with themanagement using the public address system at dawn to inform guestsof the impending move.   The Intercontinental came next, followed by the Peninsula, whereguests had slept in the lobby. Guests at the hotels saidelectricity, telephone and water service all had deteriorated byearly Wednesday.   At the duty-free center, the United States and several othercountries set up reception desks and the government providedassistance for transportation and hotel bookings.   ``It feels good,'' said Kay as he nursed a cold San Miguel beernext to a reception desk set up by the U.S. Embassy. ``I'm happy tobe out.''</TEXT></DOC>
