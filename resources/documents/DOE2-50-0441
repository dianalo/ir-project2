This approachdiffers from the general concept of applying an open interval over theentire pay zone to obtain maximum flow potential as in many conventionaloil reservoirs. The reasons are that bitumen and connate water at initialreservoir conditions are practically immobile where injectivity relieson small flow channels such as fractures and, that steam has a tendencyto override, resulting in poor vertical sweep efficiency. This paperpresents results on the effects of production well open interval on steamfloorperformance in oil sand reservoirs. Two parameters, namely aspect ratio,defined as pay thickness to well spacing, and percentage of open intervalwere investigated using a commercial thermal reservoir simulator. Resultsindicate that oil steam ratio can be improved by limiting the lengthof open intervals of the production well, at the bottom of thick reservoirsin a steam override case. For a small aspect ratio a large open intervalis preferred; however, the oil steam ratio is less sensitive to openinterval in this instance. For the case of steam underride, the oil steamratio is insensitive to open interval. This relationship was explainedby the relative magnitude of the two driving forces, gravity drainageand pressure gradient, in steamflood projects. 2 refs., 10 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
