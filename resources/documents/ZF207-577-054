(John Sculley)andM;</TITLE><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>.  .  .  Lots of customers don't consider MultiFinder to be a viablealternative to DAs (which we asked you about in July '89).andP;  &quot;MultiFinder istotally unusable on my 1 -megabyte Mac; even on my boss's 2megabyte Mac 11,it's still almost worthless,&quot; says F.andP;  C.andP;  Foerster of Yucaipa, California.andO;He adds that when he does upgrade to 2 megabytes, he'll use MultiFinder only&quot;to show my non-Mac-using friends what the machine has the potential to do.&quot;andO;And although MultiFinder operation (along with Startup and Control Paneldocuments) can provide much the same functionality as DAs, some users - suchas Jack Fu of South San Francisco, California - offer further evidence thatDAs are the cleanest way to access multiple applications: &quot;Just take a lookat how IBM and Microsoft are trying (although failing) to copy the DAinterface.&quot;andM;.  .  .and users are skeptical about the prospects of peaceful coexistencebetween newer multimegabyte Macs running System 7.0 and older machines thatwill be stuck with System 6.0 (our September '89 question).andP;  Michael JohnGregorek of Staten Island, New York, knows what Mac users want: &quot;We just wanta single computer that does it all, basically like the original Mac.andO;Obviously the IIcx is the best, as it isn't seriously threatened withobsolescence.&quot; He suggests that Apple should use package-deal pricing to helpcustomers make the right choice.andP;  Others see the choices as less clear-cut:&quot;The Mac product line is in chaos,&quot; writes Hunt Blair of Providence, RhodeIsland.andP;  &quot;All these slightly differing machines, each new model sporting asnazzier System and other sexy improvements (the logic of which doesn'talways flow backward to older models) - it's confusing as can be.andP;  I mightbuy another Mac - or an office full of them for my business - but I don'twant to buy a new-generation Mac just to stay compatible.andP;  I can't afford toreplace CPUs more often than absolutely necessary, and the new, more-powerfulmachines will have to work well in a network that includes older models.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
