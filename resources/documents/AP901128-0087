He was 89.   Pearce, a former senior judge, died Monday at his home in thevillage of Crowborough in the county of Sussex in southern England.No cause of death was given.   Pearce visited what was then Rhodesia and is now Zimbabwe ashead of the government panel in 1972.   His presence was regarded as the first genuine and independentoutlet for black majority opinion in many years.   On Nov. 11, 1965, the then white minority government of IanSmith had declared itself free of all remaining colonial links withBritain.   Britain was hoping to steer Rhodesia to full independence undereventual black rule. It said the independence declaration wasillegal and that independence under continuing white rule, assought by Smith, must be acceptable to the entire population.   Pearce's panel was set up to determine whether proposals for aconstitutional settlement with Smith's administration forcontinuing white rule were acceptable on this basis.   The commission ruled that the proposals were unacceptable tomost Africans there, who distrusted the Smith administration.   Subsequent negotiations between Britain and Smith'sadministration failed.   The issue was resolved by a conference in London in 1979.Elections were held in February 1980, and the country gainedindependence from Britain on April 18, 1980, as the black-ruledRepublic of Zimbabwe.   Pearce was a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, or Law Lord, from 1962to 1967. The Law Lords constitute the highest court in the land.   He was chairman of the Press Council, a watchdog body forBritish newspapers, from 1969 to 1974.   It was not known whether there were any survivors.
