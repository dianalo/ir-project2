Against the yen, the dollar in late trading was near its opening levels in Tokyo after a dip below 127 yen triggered some dollar demand.    In late trading, the dollar stood at 1.7991 marks, off from 1.8135 late Wednesday in New York. The U.S. currency also was changing hands at 126.90 yen, down from 127.48 yen. Sterling was quoted at $1.7637, up from $1.7507 late Wednesday.    In Tokyo on Friday, the dollar opened at 126.55, off 0.60 yen from Thursday's close of 127.15 yen.    Profit-taking on short dollar positions against the yen and the mark at the end of European trading day provided a boost for the U.S. currency on Thursday. But a second sell-off in late New York trading pushed the dollar below its intraday lows of 1.7993 against the mark and below 127 yen. Traders said the second round of selling was a result of continued bearish market sentiment in a thin market and not because of any specific news.    The switch in the market to pushing the dollar lower against the mark instead of against the yen is the result of West German and Japanese monetary policies, said Andrew Hodge, vice president of corporate treasury services with Bank Brussels Lambert in New York.    &quot;The explanation lies in the fundamental reason that Japanese are more likely to stem the yen's rise by lowering interest rates,&quot; Mr. Hodge said. &quot;The Germans aren't going to do anything to lower rates.&quot;    Mr. Hodge said that during the past week the Japanese had established a clear trend of an easier monetary policy with &quot;no reason except dollar defense.&quot;    Sterling began posting gains in a quiet Asian market as traders moved into the U.K. currency because of its status as a high-yield currency, said Michael Guarino, vice president and chief dealer with Algemene Bank NV in New York.    The pound also was boosted by U.K. September money supply and bank lending data that confirmed the market's view that U.K. interest rates will remain firm in the near-term.    &quot;Right now, we're on the threshold of a good dollar move down,&quot; said Mr. Guarino. &quot;By the end of October and the beginning of November, the dollar will be trading between 1.7500 marks to 1.7800 marks. I think we'll start to see central bank intervention at 1.7800 marks.&quot;    &quot;Foreigners are moving their money to their home bases and the market is left with an excess liquidity of dollars,&quot; said Mr. Guarino. He added part of the liquidity was created by the large scale sale of dollars by the central banks to cap the U.S. currency's summer rally. &quot;We're waiting for the central banks to intervene in the market and take that liquidity out.&quot;    Dan Holland, vice president with Discount Corp., said, &quot;There is continued bearish sentiment on the dollar. There is the feeling the (U.S) trade numbers won't get better and the (U.S.) economy isn't as robust as it was.&quot;    Mr. Holland agreed with Mr. Guarino's prediction that the dollar would head lower, but asserted that it would creep downward toward the 120 yen and 1.7000 mark level by the end of the year.    On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery rose $1.80 to $412.20 an ounce in light to moderate trading. Estimated volume was 2.6 million ounces.    In Hong Kong early Friday, gold was quoted at $411.10 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
