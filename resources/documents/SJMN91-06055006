Well, maybe not everybody,but we sure say so. Hardly a week goes by without one of our national leadersreferring to Americans as a peace-loving people.;    What can they be thinkingof?  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Perspective  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PATTON WAS RIGHT: AMERICANS LOVE WAR  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Points of ViewDonald Kaul is a syndicated columnist.  </MEMO><TEXT>     In the past 50 years, we have fought four major wars; that is, wars thatfully engaged the national attention. In addition, we have invaded Panama,Grenada and the Dominican Republic; sent troops to Lebanon (twice); givennaval escort in wartime to ships in the Persian Gulf; bombed Libya; providedclandestine military support to various regimes and rebel groups in CentralAmerica; conspired in the assassination of at least three foreign heads ofstate; launched war planes to help thwart a coup in the Philippines andnurtured a military assault on Cuba. Those are merely the adventures that comereadily to my aging mind; I'm sure there are others.;    None of these wars,invasions, incursions, police actions and punitive expeditions, I hasten topoint out, involved the defense of our soil (although, to be fair, World WarII might qualify in that regard since it began for us with the bombing ofHawaii).;    No other country in the past half-century can match our recordfor embracing armed conflict as a foreign policy tool.;    Nor have we, forthe most part, gone into these battles reluctantly. American presidents arenever more popular than when they take us to war. It is only when we areperceived as losing the war that public opinion turns on them.;    The factis, we are a war-like people. I remember being shocked when Gen. George Pattonsaid as much. &quot;Americans love war,&quot; he said in a famous address to his troopson the eve of battle.;    He was right.;    I'm not sure the soldiers involvedare enthralled with war, but the people at home are invariably enthusiasticabout it. They decorate the streets with ribbons and flags, as if incelebration. They say it's to show support for the troops, but it's the warthat gets supported.;    In theory, we conduct our wars in a civilized manner,adhering scrupulously to the rules laid down by the Geneva Convention; notargeting of civilians, no poison gas, no abuse of prisoners. In practice, weare less fastidious.;    Even as we bomb Iraqi troops to pulp we are outragedat the thought that Saddam might use chemical weapons against us. He is&quot;without a shred of human decency,&quot; we are told.;    Have you heard about ourair-fuel bombs? They explode above the ground, sending out a fine mist ofpetroleum jelly which then ignites, creating a firestorm that sucks up theoxygen over an area the size of four or five football fields, suffocating itsvictims, Dresden-style.;    Why is that not a chemical weapon? What makes itmore ethical than poison gas? You say that the difference is that air-fuelbombs are not banned by the Geneva Convention.;    Oh, I see.;    We are manythings, some of them good, but peace-loving we are not. We are, instead,war-like creatures of self-delusion, able to convince ourselves of thenobility of our cause, no matter what means we use to pursue it.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Donald Kaul column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910224  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  551  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday February 24, 199100055006,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
