The approval had been expected.    The sale, scheduled to close on July 31, is subject to a binding agreement and to approvals by lenders and partners on some of Cadillac's properties.    Mr. Prentiss, president of Cadillac's Urban Development unit in Dallas, will be joined by Copley Real Estate Advisers, an affiliate of New England, a Massachusetts insurance concern.    As reported, JMB Realty Corp. of Chicago had agreed to buy all of Cadillac for $2 billion. Assuming the Prentiss transaction is completed, JMB will buy the rest of Cadillac for about $1.45 billion. If the Prentiss purchase were to fall through, JMB would be committed to its original $2 billion price tag for the entire company. </TEXT></DOC>
