Those factors contributed to the U.S. currency's 3.3% jump against the West German mark between last Wednesday and Friday. And, said Francoise Soares-Kemp, chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais in New York, &quot;the dollar could hit two marks if we get a further accumulation of good news.&quot;    Even so, she added that in the &quot;longer term, people are still skeptical. It's not like everybody all of a sudden loves the dollar.&quot;    Last week, the U.S. reported a slew of unexpectedly positive statistics for leading economic indicators, new factory orders, single-family home sales and civilian employment. The week before, it announced that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed sharply in December, to a 21-month low.    At the same time, West German indicators pointed to a slowing economy, one whose export industries are starting to be hurt by the weaker dollar and the currencies of 46 other countries that are linked directly or indirectly to the U.S. unit. Despite a record 1986 German trade surplus -- equivalent to $60.27 billion, more than 50% higher than the year-before figure -- the U.S. share of German exports fell to 9.9% in October from 10.8% in July 1986, according to the Cologne-based Institut der Deutschen Wirtschaft.    On Friday, the dollar advanced against most major currencies for the third consecutive day. It was aided by a larger-than-expected rise in U.S. nonfarm employment and reports late Thursday that Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker see &quot;eye-to-eye&quot; on the negative consequences of a free-falling dollar. Also buoying the currency were reports from bankers that Japanese investors had purchased a good portion of last week's $29 billion Treasury refunding.    Mr. Volcker has repeatedly warned that a sudden, steep dollar decline could aggravate inflationary pressures, scare away foreign capital needed to finance the U.S. budget deficit, force interest rates to rise and push the U.S. economy into a recession.    The Labor Department reported that nonfarm payrolls in January rose by 448,000 -- twice market expectations -- and that the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7% of the labor force.    In late New York trading Friday, the dollar stood at 1.8610 marks, up 1.3% from 1.8365 the day before. The currency rose to 154.35 yen from 153.62. The British pound fell to $1.5075 from $1.5185.    But despite this background, &quot;the fundamental situation for the U.S. hasn't changed so much,&quot; said Aloys Schwietert, chief economist for Swiss Bank Corp. in Basel, Switzerland. &quot;We're just collecting better movement in some of the indicators.&quot;    He and others argued that the U.S. current account, the broadest measure of the nation's trade, will have to show significant improvement over two quarters to convince markets that the dollar's fall is taking hold. And that, they said, isn't likely. Many analysts believe the U.S. trade deficit will narrow to only about $140 billion or $150 billion this year from $169.78 billion in 1986.    &quot;I don't think the recent surge of the dollar represents a real change of a (downward) trend; it's just a technical correction,&quot; said Nicole Theze, an economist at Banque Nationale de Paris in Paris. &quot;It happens often after large drops; there's no real change in feeling about the dollar.&quot;    Even though the order books of European exporters have begun to show the strain of stronger currencies that might be 10% to 15% overvalued against the dollar on a purchasing-power parity basis, Mr. Schwietert said that currencies such as the mark and Swiss franc might have to rise another 10% before the market share of European multinational corporations starts to erode at a faster pace.    &quot;German and Swiss exporters have more power to withstand (their appreciating currencies) for quite a while,&quot; he said.    John Lipsky, a vice president at Salomon Brothers Inc., noted that the U.S. monthly trade and unemployment numbers are &quot;unreliable.&quot; He said that while the jump in January's nonfarm payrolls looked impressive, &quot;it didn't point to a significant increase in income,&quot; and, thus, U.S. growth.    Further, James M. Pugh, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., said: &quot;I dont see how the (dollar) can strengthen when we have to fund a $200 billion (budget) deficit.&quot;    In a study scheduled for release today, Lloyds Bank PLC projects that the dollar will decline to 1.65 marks and 140 yen by the end of the year. Moreover, &quot;we don't believe Japan and Germany will reflate their economies, which means the administration won't try too hard to prevent the dollar from falling,&quot; said Christopher Johnson, group economic advisor at Lloyds in London.    For some time, Washington has prodded Tokyo and Bonn to stimulate their economies -- as an alternative to a falling dollar -- to absorb more exports, particularly from the U.S. and developing countries.    Mr. Johnson also dismissed current market concerns that senior monetary officials from the Group of Five -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France -- would meet soon to deal with currency instability. &quot;It looks like G-5 won't happen now and, if it did, it wouldn't decide anything,&quot; he said.    There are some optimists, however. Ulrich Ramm, chief economist for Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, West Germany, believes the weakened dollar could begin reducing the U.S. trade deficit. &quot;We think the pessimistic forecasts for (the U.S.) current account are perhaps too pessimistic,&quot; he said. He added that the deficit didn't actually have to fall sharply to, say, the $50 billion range to establish confidence in currency markets. All that is needed, he said, is &quot;a sign that it was possible.&quot;    While the dollar's current value might not be enough to significantly increase U.S. exports in world markets, Mr. Ramm said it is sufficiently low to reduce foreign competitiveness in U.S. domestic markets.    ---                        CURRENCY RATES                          New York    Home Mkt.
