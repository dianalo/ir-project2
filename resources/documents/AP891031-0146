Gorbachevthat would result in the first at-sea superpower summit in nearlyhalf a century.   With his visit to fast-changing Poland and Hungary fresh in hismind, Bush wrote the invitation July 18 aboard Air Force One as heflew home from Europe after a seven-nation economic summit in Paris.   His journey to the East bloc nations, and talks with U.S. alliesin Paris, persuaded him that his first meeting as president withthe Soviet leader should be an informal one, ``without muchfanfare,'' Bush said in announcing the summit meeting Tuesday.   Unveiling what had been the administration's best-kept foreignpolicy secret, Bush announced that he and Gorbachev would meet Dec.2 and 3 aboard U.S. and Soviet naval vessels in the Mediterranean.   The meeting, with many logistics still to be worked out, wouldbe the first high-seas summit since President Franklin D. Rooseveltmet with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill on a battleshipin the North Atlantic in 1941 to discuss the war in Europe.   Bush, who has been accused by some of dragging his feet onholding a meeting with Gorbachev, repeatedly said at a newsconference that he had been the one to initiate the meeting, andthat he had done so in July.   ``I didn't want to _ in this time of dynamic change (in EasternEurope) _ miss something, something that I might get betterfirsthand from Mr. Gorbachev,'' he said.   A senior administration official, who spoke on the condition ofanonymity, provided some of the details of the genesis ofDecember's meeting.   Nearly every leader Bush met with in both Poland and Hungary,from Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa to government officials,urged Bush to ``be supportive'' of Gorbachev's efforts to reformhis own country and to ``release some of the bonds on theircountries,'' the official said.   ``So out of that, the president's thinking was that that wouldbe the kind of thing that he would like to do in privatediscussions but without having to worry about the pressures andburdens of arms control agreements and the more formal agendaitems,'' the official said.   Bush took pains to say there is no set agenda of issues to bediscussed, but the official said, ``Clearly he'll have a set ofspecific ideas.''   When Bush met with major U.S. allies during the economic summit,many of those leaders also called on him to meet with Gorbachev,the sooner the better, the official said.   Bush was exploring ``a way to have a meeting with the generalsecretary but which would be something short of the traditionalsummit,'' the official said.   In a meeting with top staff aides on the veranda of the U.S.ambassador's residence in Paris, Bush advanced the idea of ``anon-summit summit,'' the official said.   Gorbachev responded to Bush's letter in early August _ acceptingthe idea and touching off a flurry of cables between Moscow andWashington as details slowly began to take shape.   There was one problem, however: Specifics still hadn't beennailed down on the next formal summit, which by custom would beheld in the United States.   ``We wanted to get the larger summit set before we finalizedthis one,'' the official said.   Finally, when Secretary of State James A. Baker III and SovietForeign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze met in Wyoming in September tocement plans for a formal summit next year, that opened the way toplan details for the mid-ocean summit, the official said.   A decision was made to hold the meeting on two ships in theMediterranean ``because they wanted it informal, isolated'' and topromote the concept of neutrality, the official said.</TEXT></DOC>
