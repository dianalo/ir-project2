 The grim words maturity and consolidation leap to more lips.andO;Go-it-alone IBM is signing partnership agreements with competitors, some sosmall they'd once have had trouble getting John Akers' phone number, muchless his signature on a contract.andP;  Dangerous surgery is being performed onRandamp;D budgets.andP;  And at a time when vendors are relying on non-U.S.andP;  sales tomaintain revenue growth, the coming of 1992 and a unified--perhapsprotected--European market inspires fear, as well as new market strategies.andO;Still, in 1988, with Japanese and European buyers compensating for weaknessin the U.S.andP;  market, the world's 100 biggest IS companies were able to postdouble-digit sales and earnings increases for the second straight year.andM;What approval this performance merits depends on when you came in and whereyou came from.andP;  Strong sales in 1988's opening quarter allayed fears of astock-market-crash-induced slowdown, but then things got dicey.andP;  While theUnited States sweltered through a record drought and high temperatures, theIS industry was high and dry as well without enough memory chips.andP;  Executivesat IS firms scrambled to cope with the sudden shortage of their most preciouscomponent and hiked prices.andP;  Customers rebelled, and suddenly some highfliers, notably Apple Computer Inc. and Wyse Technology in the United Statesand Amstrad PLC in the United Kingdom, had to back off.andM;Turmoil in PCs made the dramatic weakness at the mainframe level all thatmuch more apparent.andP;  Add to that a lackluster year for Digital, which hasprovided much of the industry's excitement in recent years, and suddenly thebusiness was abuzz with talk of another slump--and the near heretical notionthat the IS industry is maturing.andM;The figures compiled by DATAMATION on the IS revenues of the top 100companies in the business show total sales in 1988 of $243.1 billion, anincrease of 16.3%, which is not as good as the 18.7% jump in 1987.andP;  Profitsrose 15.8%--respectable, but pallid compared with the 27.2% increase postedthe previous year.andP;  The quarterly performance of 10 U.S.-based IS companiestracked by DATAMATION saw year-to-year revenue growth drop two percentagepoints between the second and third calendar quarters before leveling off atthe end of the year at 11%.andP;  (See the &quot;IS Barometer&quot; on page 19.)andM;The one trend that is clearly up--and decisively so--is the growinginternational nature of the business.andP;  By design or by default (certainly bynecessity), the IS industry became more global than ever in 1988, pulledthere by market forces, currency fluctuations and the imperative oftechnology itself.andM;International Sales UpandM;The sales slowdown in the United States together with the cheaper dollarboosted the international business of several U.S.-based IS companies.andP;  IBM,for the second year in a row, sold more abroad than it did at home.andP;  In fact,the only real sales growth Big Blue experienced came outside the UnitedStates.andP;  Altogether, 14 U.S.andP;  companies on the DATAMATION 100 derived morethan half their revenues from outside the United States, including Digital,Hewlett-Packard Co., NCR Corp., Tandem Computers Inc. and Microsoft Corp.andO;COMPAQ Computer Corp. saw its sales rise some 145% in Europe, making it oneof the top 25 IS vendors there.andP;  Reliance on a weak dollar for exportstrength is, however, a shaky foundation for long-term planning: the spring1989 increase in the strength of U.S.andP;  currency could weaken the overseassales of some U.S.andP;  vendors.andM;In Europe, harbingers of 1992's common-market unification have spurred a slewof cross-border alliances.andP;  European companies, accustomed to sheltered homemarkets, must quickly acquire the scale and the management savvy to competeon the newly open European market.andM;Finland-based Nokia Corp. has been the most active European company to date,acquiring the IS business of LMEricsson Telephone Co. in neighboring Swedenand moving into West Germany to pick up a television manufacturer.andP;  SiemensAG, shut out of an important telecommunications deal with Italy's Italtel,salved its wounds by participating in a bid for Britain's Plessey Co.andP;  PLCand coming to the United States to take Rolm off IBM's hands.andP;  Siemens alsoinitiated a massive reorganization in 1988, as did Olivetti, both withessentially the same stated goal: to flatten the corporate pyramid and makethe companies' responses to the marketplace more supple.andM;In the United Kingdom, STC PLC, in which Northern Telecom Ltd. owns a 24%equity, bought Northern's European data terminal business, then crossed theAtlantic to snatch up the minicomputer maker Computer Consoles Inc. and theDatachecker operation of National Semiconductor Corp.andP;  The merger of SystemsDesigners and Scicon International in the United Kingdom created Europe'ssecond-largest software and services house after France's Cap Gemini Sogeti,with the newly expanded Sema Group taking the third position, thanks to themerger between Sema-Metra of France and Cap Group PLC in the United Kingdom.andO;Finsiel SpA, the Italian software and services company, and Europe ComputerSystems, the leasing firm owned by the French Bank Societe Generale, alsogrew outside their home countries, with Finsiel testing the waters in theUnited States.andM;The dangers of a vendor relying too heavily on its home market were clearlyin evidence at Norsk Data AS, which reported a $41.6 million pretax loss in1988 after losing key strategic orders to the likes of Apple, Digital, IBMand Groupe Bull.andP;  Both Norsk Data AS and Comparex Informationssysteme GmbHare leading examples of European companies that analysts believe must weanthemselves from overdependence on their home bases.andM;Japanese Eye Global MarketsandM;Japanese companies are also positioning themselves in newly opening globalmarkets.andP;  Since the mid-1980s they have been assiduously shiftingmanufacturing operations closer to their export markets, a trend thatcontinued in 1988.andP;  Urgency was added by the strength of the yen and fears ofpotential trade restrictions in both Europe and the United States.andP;  AlpsElectric Co.andP;  Ltd. announced it was building a manufacturing plant in WestGermany and also expanding its operations in the United States.andP;  Both SeikoEpson Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. announced new plants in the United Kingdom whileMitsubishi Electric Corp. announced it would establish a subsidiary withmanufacturing facilities in France.andM;The geographic distribution of companies on the DATAMATION 100 was exactlythe same as it was in 1987: 61 North American companies, 22 from Europe and17 from Japan and the Far East.andP;  (Acer Group from Taiwan replaced SamsungGroup from South Korea).andM;The makeup of the top 10 is also the same as last year, the year before thatand (taking into account the Unisys merger) the year before that: Five U.S.andO;companies (IBM, Digital, Unisys Corp., Hewlett-Packard and NCR); threeJapanese companies (Fujitsu, NEC Corp. and Hitachi Ltd.) and two Europeancompanies (Siemens and Olivetti).andM;These 10 companies--with Groupe Bull waiting in the wings--make up the newglobal IS junta.andP;  Collectively, these ten companies controlled more than halfof the total IS market in 1988, with IBM alone accounting for 22.6%.andP;  Theyare to the global IS market of the 1980s what IBM and the BUNCH were to theUnited States in the 1970s.andP;  The rise of these global IS giants has generatedfears of potentially destructive trade wars.andP;  For several years, tradefriction has been a staple of U.S.-Japanese relations, and both of thosesuperpowers are watching warily to detect any inkling of &quot;Fortress Europe&quot; inthe preparations for 1992.andM;Growing Global CooperationandM;But focusing on the trade-war aspect of global competition may disguiseanother, potentially more significant trend: the growing level of globalcooperation among today's largest multinational companies.andP;  According to thisscenario, what the big companies really fear is not each other, but the smallupstart companies in their home markets--companies that develop innovativeproducts and grab precious market share.andP;  According to Kenichi Ohmae ofMcKinsey andamp; Co., whose book Triad Power, published by the Free Press in 1985,describes the new style of global competition between European, Japanese andU.S.andP;  multinationals, &quot;There is clear indication today that the topmanagement of global enterprises are seriously interested in protecting homemarket positions and, if necessary, are willing to cooperate with otherTriad-region competitors rather than fight them off in destructive tradewars.&quot;andM;Slackening demand in the United States makes an increased international focusnecessary for North American IS firms.andP;  Mergers, the downsizing of corporateAmerica, the ability to buy more computer power for less money, thecontinuous sniping over standards--all of these much-discussed trends havecontributed to reduced growth in the U.S.andP;  market.andP;  In 1988, sales byDATAMATION 100 companies into the U.S.andP;  market grew by only 8.4%, comparedwith 14.5% for Europe and 29% in Asia/Pacific, including Japan.andP;  In 1988, theNorth American share of overall DATAMATION 100 sales slipped to 38.4% from1987's 40.8% with almost all of that difference accounted for by the growthin Japanese demand for IS.andM;The decline in the popularity of big systems bears much of the blame for thecontraction in the U.S.andP;  market.andP;  IBM, Control Data Corp., NCR and Unisys allposted mainframe sales that ranged from mediocre to just plain bad.andP;  In sharpcontrast, the leading Japanese mainframe makers posted revenue growth intheir own currency of as much as 20%.andP;  In the United States, only AmdahlCorp. could report comparable results, its processor sales rising 32.3%.andO;Overall, the big machine's role in the IS market continued to drift downward,accounting for only 12.5% of sales last year.andM;Unhealthy MinisandM;Minicomputer sales--even including workstations--were far less healthy thananyone would have expected.andP;  In the United States, Digital was definitely offits feed, while Wang Laboratories Inc. and Data General Corp. were positivelyanemic.andP;  The big European minicomputer makers, Nokia (which acquiredEricsson's ailing IS business) and Norsk Data, both had poor years.andP;  Overall,worldwide minicomputer sales rose just 8% and account for an even 10% of theoverall IS market.andP;  The area in minicomputers that bears continued watchingis on-line transaction processing (OLTP) which, according to Dataquest Inc.,andO;a market research firm in San Jose, Calif., now accounts for one out of everytwo system sales.andM;Sluggish performance in the mainframe and minicomputer segments was part ofthe evidence cited by those who believe that IS is maturing.andP;  But for somesegments of the industry, such as software, maturation actually means growth,and 1988 provided a hint of the kind of growth the industry can expect to seein the future.andM;Software sales rose 22.3% last year to $20.8 billion.andP;  The stellar performerhere was Oracle Corp., the mainframe software company thatandM;is appearing on the DATAMATION 100 for the first time.andP;   Oracle'sandM;114.4% growth rate was tops among companies that did not grow byacquisition--the first time a software company has achieved that distinctionsince Lotus Development Corp. did it in 1984.andM;Oracle provides a telling insight in to the future of the IS businessbecause, as Michael Braude points out in his analysis of the softwarebusiness on page 160, it successfully exploits the very things--standards,open architectures, downsizing--that bedevil established IS competitors.andP;  AndOracle seems to understand the kind of marketing clout that's needed to getits story across to customers.andM;The revenuws of the computer services companies on the DATAMATION 100 grew ahealthy 23.1% in 1988 thanks to new entrants and the growth of systemsintegration.andP;  Electronic Data Systems Corp. proved there is life after H.andO;Ross Perot, posting a 32.4% sales increase and emerging as the number 1company in services.andP;  In Europe, acquisitions and mergers fueled the rise ofCap Gemini, SD-Scicon and Sema Group, the latter two appearing on theDATAMATION 100 for the first time.andP;  Other newcomers in the services sectorincluded American Express, which has just started to release informationabout its various information  services subsidiaries, primarily in creditcard processing; NYNEX Corp., the Bell operating company that acquired AGSComputers Inc. and became a full-fledged player in systems integration; andScience Applications International Corp., the employee-owned firm that hastraditionally specialized in national security work, but which is now turningits attention to commercial systems integration and commercial softwaredevelopment.andM;Despite staff defections, Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. posted a 60% gain inworldwide revenues from systems integration and software reaching just under$1.2 billion.andP;  Among all the Big Eight firms, Arthur Andersen has the largestdata services group, but it now has a new and potentially formidablecompetitor in the newly merged Arthur Young and Ernst andamp; Whinney, which hadcombined systems integration revenues in 1988 of just under a half billiondollars.andP;  In Japan, CSK Corp. became the first big Japanese company to focuson systems integration.andM;Strength in MicrosandM;But microcomputers continue to attract the most attention.andP;  Despite thememory chip shortage, worldwide sales rose a remarkable 26.8% and now accountfor 11.7% of overall IS sales, very nearly rivaling sales of mainframes.andO;Compaq, Apple, Toshiba Corp. and Zenith Electronics Corp. all posted strongperformances in 1988.andP;  In the United States, according to Dataquest, Appleactually surpassed IBM in PC unit market share, reflecting the lukewarmacceptance accorded the PS/2 and the premature withdrawal of the AT.andP;  Two newU.S.-based PC companies to make the DATAMATION 100 in 1988 were Atari Corp.andO;(which does 85% of its sales in Europe) and AST Research Inc.andP;  According toDataquest, Korean and Taiwanese companies will begin to come on strong.andO;Acer, the largest such company to date, made the DATAMATION 100 for the firsttime in 1988, reporting PC sales of just under $300 million.andM;The $61.8 billion market for peripherals was the scene of upheaval amongdisk-drive makers with the transition to 3-1/2-inch drives.andP;  Micropolis Corp.andO;earned the distinction of debuting on the DATAMATION 100 while, in the sameyear reporting a net loss.andP;  Two other newcomers to the DATAMATION 100 were inthe magnetic media area: Eastman Kodak Co., owner of Verbatim Corp, returnedto the DATAMATION 100 after a one-year absence; Anacomp Inc., better knownfor its computer-output microfilm business, appears on the list having bought(and now having put up for sale) the magnetic media part of Xidex Corp.'sbusiness.andM;Sales of data communications equipment, including communications processors,PBXs, modems, multiplexors and the like rose only 6.7% to $16 billion in1988.andP;  Price competition in all aspects of data communications and thecontinual evolution of standards kept this market in check.andP;  ATandamp;T took a $6.7billion charge for digitizing its network--a process the company hopes tohave substantially completed by 1992.andP;  Northern Telecom also took a $200million write-down for restructuring costs and announced a big push intoEurope and Asia in an effort to overcome flat sales revenue in the tightNorth American market.andM;Maintenance revenues, an increasingly important source of income for IScompanies, were essentially flat in 1988 at just under $30 billion.andP;  Thatfigure reflects the effects of price wars unleashed by IBM.andP;  Revenues ofcompanies in the DATAMATION 100'S &quot;other&quot; category, which consists primarilyof independent computer leasing firms in the United States and Europe, werealso flat, reflecting the extremely tight conditions in that market.andM;Companies that dropped off the DATAMATION 100 in 1988 include DatapointCorp., the one-time minicomputer and local area network pioneer; TandonCorp., which has shifted from disk drives to PC clones; Tektronix Inc.,andO;slumping because of ailing terminal business; and Gould Inc., acquired in1988 by Nippon Mining Co.andP;  Ltd. (In March, 1989, Nippon Mining sold Gould'sIS business to Encore Computer Corp.)andM;Ten companies on the DATAMATION 100 lost money in 1988.andP;  Two minicomputercompanies, Data General and Norsk Data, both suffered because of their closedarchitectures and Norsk's overreliance on its home market.andP;  Two disk drivemakers, Micropolis and Seagate Technology, misjudged the rapid shifts in thatmarket.andP;  Wyse was done in by the memory chip shortage and Dataproducts by theshift to laser printers.andP;  Continental  Information Systems tried to grow toofast, too soon in the highly competitive leasing market, ending up in Chapter11 bankruptcy proceedings.andP;  ATandamp;T's massive write-off for upgrading itslong-distance network devoured its profits, while Atari's loss stemmed fromthe write-off of its disastrous foray into computer retailing.andM;The swelling concern over junk-bond mergers--one of the biggest businessstories of 1988--was not a big factor in IS.andP;  In  the United States, bigacquisitions were in computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) withPrime Computer Inc.'s purchase of both Computervision Corp. and part ofGeneral Electric's Calma Co. business.andP;  Another large IS acquisition wasComputer Associates International Inc.'s purchase of Applied Data ResearchInc. from Ameritech Corp.andP;  Hewlett-Packard's purchase of Apollo Computer Inc.andO;gives HP first place in the evolving workstation market.andP;  In Europe, thebiggest deal was Nokia's  purchase of Ericson's undernourished IS operations.andM;Missing LinksandM;Among the most interesting linkups were those that didn't happen: NCR wassaid to be a target, first of Unisys and then of ATandamp;T.andP;  Apple and CrayResearch Inc. were proposed by some as an ideal match, as were Wang and XeroxCorp.andP;  The takeover threat prompted Xerox to restructure and refocus itsmarketing, particularly of its publishing systems; takeover talk was also animpetus behind Lockheed Corp.'s decision to put its IS businesses on theblock.andP;  To come, of course, is the denouement of the long-running MAI BasicFour Inc. attack on Prime.andM;While merger mania did not take hold in IS, critics view a slackeningcommitment to Randamp;D as emblematic of the same short-term, get rich quickoutlook.andP;  Although Randamp;D spending rose overall by nearly 15%, the typical Randamp;Dcommitment by U.S.andP;  DATAMATION 100 firms dropped a full percentage point from10.9% of total revenue to 9.9%.andP;  This shrinking commitment to Randamp;D comes at atime when Japanese firms are redeploying their Randamp;D activities on a globalbasis.andP;  NEC opened its NEC Research Institute in Princeton, N.J., in 1988,and Epson, Hitachi and Canon Inc. have all indicated plans to establish Randamp;Dcenters in the United States and Europe.andP;  Among U.S.andP;  IS companies, only IBMhas a significant Randamp;D presence worldwide, but there are signs that situationmay be changing.andP;  Recent studies by the National Science Foundation show thatRandamp;D spending by U.S.andP;  companies is increasing more abroad than it is at home.andM;At the beginning of the 1980s, when the United States was both the biggestand the fastest-growing IS market, a U.S.andP;  strategy was a global strategy.andO;But that's not the case now.andP;  The world simply doesn't work that way anymore.andM;MethodologyandM;Throughout the year, DATAMATION collects information on more than 200companies on a worldwide basis.andP;  The companies are then ranked on the basisof their IS revenues for the calendar year.andP;  All revenue and earnings figuresin the current DATAMATION 100 are for calendar year 1988.andP;  Because manycompanies operate on a fiscal year that does not coincide with the calendaryear, some data, such as expenditures on research and development, arereported as of the company's most recent fiscal yearend.andM;For the purposes of the DATAMATION 100 survey, data-processing revenues aredefined as being derived from sales of the following: computer systems,including mainframes, minicomputers, microcomputers, personal computers,workstations, word processors, office systems and CAD/CAM systems;peripherals, including terminals, printers, plotters, disk drives, tapedrives, magnetic media and data entry devices; software, including operatingsystems and applications programs; data communications equipment, includingcommunications processors, local area networks, digital PBXs, multiplexors,modems and facsimile machines; data services, including custom programming,systems integration, consulting, time-sharing and remote processing;maintenance and repair; computer leasing; point-of-sale systems; andautomatic teller machines.andM;Explicitly excluded are the following: data transmission or &quot;basic&quot; servicesfrom specialized common carriers that are not integrated with adata-processing service; stand-alone electronic or mag card typewriters;stand-alone electronic cash registers; instrumentation; semiconductors;printed circuit boards; automatic test equipment; DP supplies, with theexception of magnetic media for disk and tape drives; industrial controldevices; central office telephone switches; analog PBXs; andcomputer-output-micrographic systems.andM;Figures listed in the DATAMATION 100 for mainframes and minicomputersrepresent only the sale of the processor itself; figures for peripherals andsoftware that are sold as part of a system are grouped into the peripheralsand software categories.andM;Whenever possible, information in the DATAMATION 100 is obtained from thecompanies themselves.andP;  When a company will not provide information, or willnot provide it in a form suitable for this survey, we have estimated thefigures based on  investigative reporting and an analysis of industry trends.andM;The net income reported for each company represents total earnings, not justearnings from data-processing revenues.andP;  Revenues derived from sales to otherdivisions or units within a company are considered captive sales and are notincluded in this survey.andM;Results for non-U.S.andP;  companies are converted into dollars using theOrganization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average exchangerates.andP;  For those currencies not part of the OECD, exchange rate informationwas provided by the International Monetary Fund.andM;For 1988, equivalents to one dollar in these currencies were the following:European Currency Unit, ECU0.8450; Finland, Fmk4.1860; France, Fr5.9560;Italy, L1301.6820; Japan, Y128.1500; the Netherlands, G1.9770; Norway,NKr6.5170; Sweden, SKr6.1290; Switzerland, SFr1.4630; Taiwan, TD28.636; theUnited Kingdom 0.5620 pound sterling; West Germany, DM1.7560; South Korea,W731.4700.andM;For 1987, equivalents to one dollar in these currencies were the following:European Currency Unit, ECU0.87; Finland, Fmk4.40; France, Fr6.01; Italy,L1296.97; Japan, Y144.62; the Netherlands, G2.03; Norway, NKr6.74; Sweden,SKr6.34; Switzerland, SFr1.50; Taiwan, D31.76; the United Kingdom, 0.61 poundsterling; West Germany, DM1.80; South Korea, W822.57.andM;DATAMATION would like to thank the following for providing information usedin the DATAMATION 100: Daratech Inc., Cambridge, Mass;
