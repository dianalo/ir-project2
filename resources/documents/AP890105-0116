Those honored with ``Operation Breakthrough'' plaques and hatsincluded businesses and government bodies that provided equipmentand assistance, and the officers and crews of two Soviet icebreakersthat helped clear a path to open water.   ``The most important thing that came out of this whole event waswhat can happen when the Soviet Union and the United Statescooperate together to make something happen,'' said CommerceSecretary C. William Verity.   Accepting plaques on behalf of the Soviet icebreakers wasAmbassador Yuri Dubinin, who called the rescue effort ``anextraordinary event of the year.''   ``It was the easiest Soviet-American negotiations because fromboth sides, immediately it was `yes' to organizing thiscooperation,'' Dubinin said. ``Now we can see that ... this type oficebreaker diplomacy is useful for all relationships between theSoviet Union and the United States and for the whole world.''   One of the three trapped gray whales died, but after nearly twoweeks of rescue efforts, two others apparently swam free of the iceon Oct. 28. The rescue was coordinated by the Commerce Department'sNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
