Redman said afterissuing a statement that lent no support to Israeli claims that theraid was retaliatory.   For more than a decade, the statement said, a long series ofcross-border violence has left death and destruction in southernLebanon and northern Israel.   ``They're tragic, and inevitably set back prospects forachieving security and stability in the area,'' Redman said.   During the raid, at least 40 Arabs were killed along with threeIsraeli soldiers, the Israeli army said.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel would not hesitate toconduct more raids in its ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon topurge it. ``There is nothing worse than allowing terror elementswho are active against us to establish themselves freely and feelfree to act against Israeli and targets in the security zone,'' hesaid.   Rabin said the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, ShiiteMoslem movement was singled out by the Israeli forces because it``has become one of the elements that most cooperates with(Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser) Arafat.''   The State Department, however, said security should be pursuedthrough ``agreed-on arrangements'' between Israel and Lebanon thatcould provide security ``for the peoples of southern Lebanon andnorthern Israel, who deserve it.''   Redman also called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces fromLebanon as ``the only way'' to achieve security and stability inthe region.   He apparently referred both to Syria, which plays a dominantrole in Lebanon and whose army controls large areas of the country,and Israel, which periodically sends forces into a belt along theborder manned by pro-Israeli Lebanese soldiers.</TEXT></DOC>
