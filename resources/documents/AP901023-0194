Investigators are unsure if the threat is in earnest, and of howmany of the fliers actually were distributed.   ``In light of what's been happening in Jerusalem, we have totake this seriously,'' said Deputy Police Chief Kenneth Gussman, aranking police commander in the borough of Brooklyn.   A 25-officer task force will focus on six precincts withsizeable Jewish populations in Brooklyn, Gussman said, and ``visitevery yeshiva (Jewish school), ask them if they have received acopy of the flier, alert them to the fact the flier had been foundand assure them of increased police attention to ally theirfears.''   The investigators also are seeking the writer of the flier,which is signed, ``Moslem from New York'' and bears a photo of awounded Palestinian shot by Israeli troops in Jerusalem on TempleMount earlier this month. Nineteen Palestinians were killed in amelee that Jews said began when Palestinians threw stones on them.   The flier says the writer will kill Jewish children, beginningMonday.   ``I think it's a prank,'' said Rabbi Bernard Freilich, directorof the Council of Jewish Organizations of Boro Park. ``This doesnot look professional, but there's a lot of concern due to what'sgoing on in the Middle East.''   The flier was found on a sidewalk on Oct. 17 by a woman who gaveit to a rabbi, Frelich said.   Copies of the flier reportedly appeared in different sections ofBrooklyn, but police and Frelich said it was not clear whether thecopies were being circulated by alarmed members of the Jewishcommunity or by others.   Sixty Jewish religious leaders and school administrators metwith police officials on Monday to discuss the situation.</TEXT></DOC>
