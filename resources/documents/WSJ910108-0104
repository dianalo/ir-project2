Oil output by the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries rose an additional 400,000 barrels a day in thepast month. OPEC is now pumping at the highest rate sincelast spring, before the Persian Gulf crisis began with Iraq'sAug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. But this latest surge may beOPEC's last until the crisis is resolved.</LP><TEXT>   Industry officials suggest OPEC's production may havepeaked, so long as exports by Iraq and Kuwait are banned bythe U.N. embargo. What is happening, they say, is that the 11other members, running flat out, are bumping limits of theirphysical capacities.   Still, enough petroleum already may be in inventory or onthe way to market in additional waves of tankers to keep theworld awash with oil whether there is a war or not.   &quot;Even if war breaks out, there is enough oil around thatthere shouldn't be any shortage,&quot; says John Lichtblau,chairman of the New York-based Petroleum Industry ResearchFoundation.   That likely won't keep oil prices from spiking sharplyhigher if shots are fired in the Persian Gulf standoff. Worldoil prices leaped as much as $3 a barrel yesterday on renewedwar fears after more tough talk from Iraq's Saddam Hussein.In U.S. futures trading, crude oil for February deliverysettled $2.75 higher at $27.65 a barrel. Heating oil andgasoline were up more than seven cents a gallon each on theNew York Mercantile Exchange.   Barring the unlikely event of serious damage to oilfacilities, however, there should not be any fundamentalsupply reason for that to occur. &quot;If there is a war, assumingthere will be little or no damage to the oil fields, there isno reason other than psychological for prices to go up,&quot; saysBahman Karbassioun, a Vienna consultant and former OPECofficial.   According to the latest estimates by Mr. Karbassioun andother monitors of OPEC's production, the group's output hasreached 23.4 million to 23.7 million barrels a day. That'ssharply higher than the recent low of 20 million barrels aday in August and some one million a day above the productionceiling the oil exporters had set earlier.   OPEC's output was averaging slightly more a year ago --around 23.8 million barrels a day for the first quarter --when all 13 members were producing. Still, OPEC's currentoutput may be too high under the circumstances -- unlessthere is war in the Middle East. The reason is that demandfor oil is down, year-to-year, because of a relatively mildwinter so far, deteriorating economic conditions in majoroil-using countries, and the price run-up early in thecrisis.   Global oil inventories haven't dropped proportionately,however. Washington-based Energy Security Analysis, whichmonitors world oil supplies, estimates commercial inventorieson shore at nearly 2.9 billion barrels, about level withthose of a year ago. Also, government inventories -- chieflyin the U.S., Germany and Japan -- are up some 20 millionbarrels in the past year to nearly one billion.   Nor do these statistics take into account oil aboardtankers at sea. Roy Mason, the Yorkshire, England, publisherof Oil Afloat, estimates that about 510 million barrels ofoil were &quot;on the water&quot; at the beginning of the year. That's20 million to 30 million barrels more than the volumes at seaa year ago, he says.   A lot of this oil is from Saudi Arabia. The kingdom'sproduction has paced recent OPEC gains. Its output hasincreased from its old OPEC quota of 5.4 million barrels toas much as 8.5 million a day.   There is no longer any debate over whether Saudi Arabiacan sustain production at such a high rate. But there is somequestion whether it can sell that much oil, with demandslackening. Also, much of the extra Saudi oil is the heavierless-desired type.   As a result, Cristina Haus, who monitors OPEC productionfor Energy Security Analysis, looks for Saudi Arabia's outputto drop to 8.2 million barrels a day in January.   Some 400,000 barrels a day of unsold Saudi oil already aresaid to be going into storage. &quot;That makes 12 million barrelsa month, plus lesser amounts from Venezuela and Iran atopprevious unsold stocks,&quot; OPEC Listener reports. &quot;This addsvalidity to other reports expecting as much as 125 millionbarrels to be in floating storage or depots near markets on15 January on the eve of any possible conflict,&quot; the industryanalysis service says.</TEXT></DOC>
