Texas Instruments Inc. of Dallas said yesterday it will pay an undisclosed fee to receive basic semiconductor technology for high-definition television developed by Japan's public broadcasting entity, NHK, and a group of leading Japanese electronics companies.    Even Texas Instruments officials said it will be months before they can ascertain the practical significance of the pact. That's when they'll find out whether NHK will transfer enough advanced technology to allow Texas Instruments to develop a competitive chip, and whether Japanese makers will actually buy chips from the U.S. company instead of from their own semicondctor operations.    But the announcement is symbolically important on many levels. The Japanese are considered far ahead of the U.S. in developing HDTV, which gives a much clearer picure than existing TVs and also includes advanced technologies that can be used in many electronics fields. As a result, the technology has become a rallying point for many in the U.S. concerned about technological competitiveness with Japan.    The agreement comes shortly after Japanese and U.S. government officials began negotiations over structural impediments to foreign business success in the Japanese market. Americans often complain that Japanese companies quietly band together to develop basic technologies, and effectively block foreign companies from participating. Japanese HDTV development is a commonly cited example.    The pact also addresses one of the demands of the U.S. semiconductor industry. Earlier this summer, the Japanese electronics trade organization promised to explore giving U.S. chip makers a bigger portion of the Japanese HDTV business.    The Texas Instruments pact also marks a rare example of technology being transferred from Japan to a U.S. company. Americans often complain that Japanese companies rose to power by taking easily accessible U.S.-developed technology and then refused to return the favor.    The timing of the Texas Instruments announcement was also good for the Japanese. It came in the middle of a visit here by U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, one of the most vocal critics of Japanese trade policies in the Bush administration. During his visit, Mr. Mosbacher has pushed for greater technological cooperation between Japanese and U.S. companies as a way to avoid trade tensions.    Mr. Mosbacher, asked at a news conference here yesterday about HDTV development, said it &quot;should be a two-way street -- this would be a good example for building that basis.&quot;    Some Americans expressed skepticism about the agreement. &quot;It sounds like borrowing the running shoes of your opponent when he's halfway around the track; it doesn't help much,&quot; said John P. Stern, a vice president of the American Electronics Association, which has been actively lobbying for the U.S. government to support a domestic HDTV industry. He added, however, that he wasn't familiar with the details of the pact.    But Texas Instruments, in its official release, said its access to the so-called MUSE technology will &quot;give it the system knowledge needed to design integrated circuits for advanced televisions&quot; and will &quot;increase its penetration of the Japanese semiconductor market.&quot;    The company said that in the next year, NHK will give lectures and &quot;extensive question-and-answer sessions&quot; explaining NHK's decoder, memory codes and other technologies to Texas Instruments officials. Texas Instruments said it will use the technology to develop &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; equipment.    NHK officials couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
