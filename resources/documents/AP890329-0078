Testifying at North's trial on 12 felony charges, Meese wasasked by prosecutor John Keker whether the White House nationalsecurity aide had mentioned the involvement of arms dealers RichardSecord or Albert Hakim in the diversion.   ``No sir,'' Meese replied when asked about Secord, then Hakim.   Meese also acknowledged that North hadn't mentioned the role ofSwiss-based attorney Willard Zucker, who worked for Hakim andSecord.   The ex-attorney general also said North hadn't mentioned how theprice of the arms sold to Iran had been marked up by 270 percent,with some of the excess going to the Contras.   Meese said he told North he shouldn't conceal anything both atthe beginning of the interview and just before disclosing that heknew of the diversion plan from a memo North prepared.   Keker's questioning followed testimony Tuesday in which Meeseagreed with defense attorney Brendan Sullivan that the Nov. 23,1986 interview was more like a ``chat'' between ``co-workers.''   Today, Sullivan in his closing question to the former attorneygeneral made the point that North had told the truth on the centralpoint of the interview by telling Meese that the diversion hadoccurred.   North is charged with falsely telling Meese that the NationalSecurity Council had no involvement with the diversion and thatIsrael determined the amount of money funneled to the Contras. Infact, North and other U.S. officials were directing the secretoperation.   Meese testified Tuesday that his interview with North was partof an ``administrative inquiry,'' not a criminal investigation.   Under questioning by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell,Meese said North's obligation to answer questions was as a ``loyalmember of the administration'' and that he was under ``no legalcompulsion'' to do so.   Meese agreed with Sullivan that the Reagan administration wasworried that the political fallout from the diversion could cause``the toppling of the president himself.''   Meese's discovery of the diversion came during a weekend inquiryhe conducted for Reagan. Earlier disclosure of the administration'ssecret weapons sales to Iran had already produced an uproar.   Meese, who informed President Reagan of the diversion on Nov.24, 1986, said he didn't know if the word ``impeachment'' itselfwas used in discussions, but that there was anxiety over ``thetremendous consequences.''   Meese said he was concerned that administration opponents mightget hold of the information and make it public, so he urged quickaction to limit the political damage. He held a news conference thenext day to announce the news.   ``I felt it vital that there not be any appearance of acoverup,'' said the former attorney general.   North was fired and his boss, national security adviser JohnPoindexter, resigned. Also, the Tower commission was created andindependent counsel Lawrence Walsh was appointed in December 1986.   ``They were the actions taken because they were the appropriateactions to take in any event,'' said Meese. ``But one of theconcerns was from preventing this from being used by politicalopponents of the president.''   Meese described interviewing North on Nov. 23, 1986, a Sunday,seeking confirmation of a memo found the previous day at North'sNational Security Council office. The memo by North outlined a planfor the diversion.   The NSC aide told Meese the diversion had already occurred froman earlier arms shipment to Iran.   ``Your worst nightmare had come true?'' North lawyer BrendanSullivan asked Meese.   ``Yes,'' Meese replied.   ``You knew that spelled trouble?'' asked Sullivan.   ``Yes, I did,'' responded Meese.</TEXT></DOC>
