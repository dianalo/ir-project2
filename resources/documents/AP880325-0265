Stevens andamp; Co.Inc., with rival textile maker West Point-Pepperell Inc. raisingits buyout offer in an attempt to thwart the takeover agreementStevens already has made with an investment group.   West Point-Pepperell offered to pay $62.50 for each of Stevens'17.8 million shares outstanding, a total of about $1.1 billion, andindicated it was willing to go higher in a negotiated deal.   West Point-Pepperell's new offer topped a bid Stevens alreadyaccepted from an investment group as well as West Point-Pepperell'sown earlier bid. Stevens agreed last week to accept a$61.50-a-share buyout offer from the New York investment groupOdyssey Partners.   The tender offer will expire at midnight EST on April 21, WestPoint-Pepperell announced today. The company also said it has filedsuit in a Delaware court against Stevens and Odyssey, chargingStevens' board of directors with breach of their duty toshareholders in signing an ``unlawful'' merger agreement withOdyssey.   Stevens stock rose 50 cents to $63.50 a share on the New YorkStock Exchange Thursday. West Point-Pepperell dropped $1.50 a shareto $33.12{.   Stevens does not plan to respond to West Point-Pepperell's newoffer ``until we have some information on which to base aresponse,'' said Stevens spokesman Jim Franklin.   Franklin said some Stevens shareholders had sued the company forrejecting West Point-Pepperell's earlier cash buyout offer of $56 ashare, or about $867 million, but declined to elaborate.   Eager to capture Stevens as part of an ambitious expansion plan,West Point-Pepperell said it would raise its latest offer to $64 ashare if Stevens accepted its proposal and signed a definitivemerger agreement by April 5. The merger agreement would have to besimilar to the accord that Stevens signed with Odyssey, WestPoint-Pepperell said.   Odyssey's offer is subject to a majority of the shares beingtendered and the necessary financing being obtained.   ``We've been absolutely frustrated by the (Stevens) board,''West Point-Pepperell Chairman Joseph L. Lanier said in a telephoneinterview. He said his company was willing to sweeten its bid to$64 a share ``if the board would only cooperate with us.''   Asked whether West Point-Pepperell would consider raising itsoffer above the conditional $64 a share, Lanier said, ``I wouldn'tpreclude it.''   West Point-Pepperell also sought to soothe potential antitrustconcerns raised by a possible merger of the two textile giants. Thecompany said that if it acquired Stevens, it would sell half ofStevens' bath lines and 20 percent of its sheet lines for about$170 million. West Point-Pepperell said it has signed a definitiveagreement for the sale with NTC Group, parent of Bidd Co., atextile manufacturer.   The comapny also said NTC had an option to acquire Stevens'automotive and residential carpeting business for $120 million.   Bidding for Stevens began shortly after it fielded a leveragedbuyout offer several weeks ago from a group led by its own seniormanagement, including Chairman Whitney Stevens _ a fifth-generationmember of the family that founded the company in 1813.   The management group initially offered $43 a share and latersweetened its bid to $55 a share in cash and securities. In aleveraged buyout, a company is acquired largely with borrowed moneyrepaid with a target company's profits or the sale of assets.   West Point-Pepperell has indicated previously that anacquisition of Stevens would fit with its strategy of focusing onconsumer products.   West Point-Pepperell's brands include Arrow, Martex, LadyPepperell and Burberrys.   Stevens, one of the nation's biggest textile makers, produceshome fashion textiles such as sheets, towels and carpets under thebrand names Ralph Lauren, Laura Ashley and Pierre Cardin. Thecompany also makes automotive and industrial products.</TEXT></DOC>
