Keating Jr., former chairman ofAmerican Continental Corp., surrendered to Californiaauthorities yesterday on a 42-count criminal fraudindictment. He was being held in a county jail here in lieuof $5 million bail.   Also indicted by the state grand jury, which since Marchhad been investigating the failure of American Continental'sCalifornia-based Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association, were aformer president of American Continental and two formerLincoln presidents. Bail was set at $1 million for Judy E.Wischer, who with Mr. Keating resigned from AmericanContinental last month, and for Ray S. Fidel and Robin S.Symes, the indicted former Lincoln officials. AmericanContinental is based in Phoenix, Ariz.</LP><TEXT>   The indictment alleges violations of the Californiacorporations code, prohibiting false statements in the saleof securities and requiring securities transactions to bewithin qualifications approved by the state. The case focuseson the more than $200 million of unsecured AmericanContinental debentures sold to 23,000 investors, oftenthrough Lincoln branch offices, before American Continentalfiled for federal bankruptcy-court protection in April 1989.   That bankruptcy-court filing rendered the debenturesworthless. Civil suits filed by bondholders, many of themretired people who contend that they were targeted for bondsales in Lincoln branches, have alleged that Lincolnofficials claimed that the debentures were federallyguaranteed and were as safe as insured certificates ofdeposit.   If convicted, each of the four faces a maximum prison termof 10 years and a fine of $250,000.   Attorneys for Mr. Keating, 66 years old, and for Mrs.Wischer, 42, and Mr. Fidel, 32, left the courtroom withoutcommenting to reporters. The former American Continentalchairman, however, has insisted in the past that purchasersof debentures were told they were unsecured. He also hasasserted that the bonds are worthless only because thegovernment forced American Continental into Chapter 11bankruptcy proceedings by moving to seize Lincoln.   Donald Smaltz, an attorney for Mr. Symes, called theamounts of bail for the four &quot;outrageous with a capital `O'&quot;and &quot;punitive in nature.&quot; He said his client, who traveledfrom his Ohio home to face the charges, has been unemployedsince leaving Lincoln last year. &quot;That amount of bail isimpossible for Mr. Symes,&quot; the attorney said, adding that heintends to seek a review.   &quot;Everybody was just shocked,&quot; Mr. Smaltz said of the baillevels. &quot;These people aren't selling anything. They're not ina position to engage in any alleged securities violations,which is what this case is all about, and they're not a riskof flight,&quot; he said.   The usually flamboyant Mr. Keating, himself a lawyer, wasunflinching in court, even when the $5 million bail wasimposed and he was led to a temporary courthouse lock-upprior to an expected transfer to the central county jail indowntown Los Angeles. Though Mr. Keating has been the centerof national controversy over his management of AmericanContinental for more than a year, these were the firstcriminal charges to be filed against him.   The four were booked, fingerprinted and photographedbefore appearing before Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner.The judge, who set formal arraignments for Oct. 5, said thebail amounts reflected the seriousness of the charges and theamount of loss by investors. He added that bail might havebeen higher had the four not voluntarily surrendered toinvestigators.   The indictment had been sealed for a week, although itsexistence was learned about Monday. The state's investigationbegan last December, when Los Angeles County DistrictAttorney Ira Reiner was named to head a statewide&quot;prosecutors' task force&quot; studying Lincoln's collapse in whatfederal officials say is one of the costliest thrift failuresever for taxpayers.   Most attention nationally in the American Continental casehas involved charges Mr. Keating and others fraudulentlytransferred funds out of Lincoln into American Continentalthrough phony tax and real-estate loan transactions, which hehas denied.   The U.S. has filed a $1.1 billion civil racketeering suitcontaining those allegations, and in ruling against Mr.Keating's own separate challenge to the government seizure ofLincoln, a federal judge said that American Continental'sactivities &quot;amounted to a looting of Lincoln.&quot; A federalgrand jury in Los Angeles also is investigating Mr. Keatingand others, according to people knowledgable about theinvestigation.   While yesterday's indictment itself was little more than alist of bondholders, each connected to an alleged state-codeviolation, the district attorney said the testimony of 94witnesses to the grand jury could be unsealed soon to providemore detail.   The grand jury has been dismissed, although a spokeswomanfor Mr. Reiner said the investigation of Lincoln's collapsecontinues and that another, sitting grand jury could hearfurther evidence, or that other criminal complaints could befiled.   Mr. Reiner told a news conference that his intent was &quot;tohave this be tightly focused so it could be easily understoodby a jury.&quot; He said previous efforts to prosecute allegedthrift frauds often were &quot;far too complex for a jury tocomprehend.&quot; Prosecutors, who said the desire to simplify thecase was one reason no more than four people were indicted,estimated that their case could take only four to six weeksto present.   ---   Marian Lucas contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
