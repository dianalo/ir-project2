Department of DefenseProductivity.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Services Sharing More Data On Their Excess InventoriesandM;Although there is no plan yet for how Defense Department officials willupgrade DOD's logistics systems, one official said that a 10-point program toreduce excess inventory has already increased processing volume on existingcomputers.andM;John A. Betti, the undersecretary of Defense for acquisition, approved theInvetory Reduction Plan (IRP) in June.andP;  The Defense Logistics Agency and theservices will determine how the IRP will be carried out, Betti said.andM;The plan was devised as part of the Bush administration's Defense ManagementReview, which Secretary Richard Cheney has said will cut costs by $39 billionduring the next five years.andP;  A synopsis of the plan released by DOD saidimproved inventory management will require systems that enhance the exchangeof information between the military services and DLA, the DOD's wholesaler.andM;The synopsis said DLA needs better reports about what supplies are on handamong the services.andP;  DLA's listings of excess goods must be made moreapparent to service supply officials, the synopsis said, so that duplicatebuying is avoided.andM;Bobby L. Parsons, DLA's automated information systems supervisor, said themodernization of the agency's Standard Automated Materiel Management System(SAMMS) is continuing and probably will speed up as the services and DLArespond to Betti's plan.andM;However, logistics officials in the services and DLS have not decided how toproceed with the enhancements.andP;  Existing DLA systems have been receivingbetter reports from the services about their unneeded items and have beenprocessing more returned items since the IRP was announced, Parsons said.andM;SAMMS is at five inventory control centers nationwide and is used to buy andmanage clothing, medical supplies, hardware and other wholesale consumableitems.andM;Parsons said that in the last three years, the agency has upgraded its SAMMSmainframes to Amdahl Corp.'s 5800 series and the operating system from MVS/SPto MVS/XA.andM;In 1986 officials identified six critical baseline enhancements that wereneeded to improve management and reporting of the consumable items purchasedby DLA and delivered throughout the DOD.andP;  Work is progressing on theenhancements, he said.andM;However, officials need to improve the capability for electronic datainterchange between the services and DLS so that more accurate and timelyinformation is available to those who need an item that is already in excesselsewhere, he said.andM;DLA officials also hope to exploit new Computer-Aided Acquisition andLogistics Systems so as to cut down on contracting lead times, Parsons said.andO;The IRP synopsis also targeted CALS applications as a potential remedy forlogistics delays.andM;&quot;We'd like to have more visibility of consumer demand patterns so that we canbetter anticipate needs,&quot; Parsons said.andP;  Systems that more quickly updateinventory information from the services, plus the use of expert systemsapplications, could give logistics officials a better way to make decisionsbefore requisitions arrive, he said.andM;Earlier this year, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired by Sen.andO;John Glenn (D-Ohio), and the General Accounting Office criticized DOD forbeing, as Glen put it, &quot;gorged with overflow and ...filled beyond capacity&quot;with surplus inventory.andM;GAO estimated that $30 billion of the $100 billion inventory was excess andsaid that about two-thirds of the unneeded supplies were spare parts.andM;Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood told Glenn that the excess amountedonly to about $10 billion.andM;Parsons said excesses show up in part because DLA buys in bulk items usedthroughout the services.andM;&quot;Items that are fast-turnaround consumables, like food, fuel or medicalsupplies, don't show up [as excess] the way parts for weapons systems might,&quot;he said.andM;Parsons compared parts buying within DOD to a homeowner who buys a pack offour fuses when only one burns out.andM;&quot;You end up with three fuses left over.andP;  If one fuse burns out every fiveyears, you've just bought 15 years of stock,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;What may look likean inordinate amount of an item in a supply status report can be deceiving.&quot;andM;Parsons said DLA depends on reports from the services, allof which areupgrading their systems.andP;  &quot;We don't tell them what's excess, they tell us,&quot;he said.andM;Parsons said that in anticipation of further cuts in U.S.andP;  military basesoverseas, DLA has been modernizing a system on which the agency captures allexcess inventory reported from Europe and the Pacific on a databasemaintained at a Dayton, Ohio, ADP center running Control Data Corp. 3500mainframes.andM;&quot;Any requisition that comes in is screened against that database to see ifthere is a potential for satisfying it&quot; among excess, Parsons said.andM;GAO in three reports outlined instances of spare parts overgrowth in DOD andsaid that the services too often do not report excesses to the SAMMS system.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
