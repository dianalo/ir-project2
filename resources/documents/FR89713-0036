The test results alsorevealed that some parts are life-limited to 26,000 landings. This condition,if not corrected, could lead to collapse of the NLG. Airbus Industrie has issued the following service bulletins which describeprocedures for repetitive inspections of the nose landing gear for cracks,and repair, if necessary.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s50,r100</C> <H1>Model </H1><H1>Service bulletin numbers and issue dates</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">A300 <D>A300-32-388, Revision 1, dated January 24, 1989</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A310 <D>A310-32-2040, dated July 15, 1988</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A300-600 <D>A300-32-6023, dated July 15, 1988</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> The above-listed service bulletins reference Messier-Hispano-Bugatti(MHB) Service Bulletin No. 470-32-641 for additional inspection instructions.</ITAG>The DGAC has classified the above service bulletins as mandatory, and hasissued French AD 88-143-088(B) addressing this subject.Airbus Industrie has also issued the following service bulletins whichdescribe procedures for modification of the NLG barrel. Accomplishmentof the modifications described in these service bulletins terminates theneed for the repetitive inspections called for in the above service bulletins.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s50,r100</C> <H1>Model </H1><H1>Service bulletin number</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">A300 <D>A300-32-389, dated October 15, 1988</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A310 <D>A310-32-2041, dated October 15, 1988</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A300-600 <D>A300-32-6024, dated October 15, 1988</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> The above-referenced service bulletins reference MHB ServiceBulletin 470-32-642 for specific modification procedures.</ITAG>This airplane model is manufactured in France and type certificated inthe United States under the provisions of andSection; 21.29 of the FederalAviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthe same type design registered in the United States, an AD is proposedwhich would require repetitive inspections of the nose landing gear barrel,and repair, if necessary, in accordance with the service bulletins previouslymentioned.Additionally, this action proposes to require modification of the NLG within18 months after the initial inspection. The degree of assurance necessaryas to the adequacy of inspections needed to maintain the safety of thetransport airplane fleet, coupled with a better understanding of the humanfactors associated with numerous repetitive inspections, has caused theFAA to place less emphasis on repetitive inspections and more emphasison design improvements and material replacement. Thus, in lieu of its previousposition of continual inspection, the FAA has decided to require, wheneverpracticable, airplane modifications necessary remove the source of theproblem addressed. The proposed modification requirements of this actionare in consonance with that policy decision.It is estimated that 90 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected bythis AD, that it would take approximately 5 manhours per airplane to accomplishthe required inspections, and that the average labor cost would be $40per manhour. It would require approximately 11 manhours to accomplish themodification at an average labor charge of $40 per manhour and $2,500 partscost per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of theAD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $282,600.The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation(1) is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economicimpact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entitiesbecause few, if any, Airbus Model A300, A310, and A300-600 series airplanesare operated by small entities. A copy of the draft evaluation preparedfor this action is contained in the regulatory docket. A copy of it maybe obtained from the Rules Docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend Part 39 of the FederalAviation Regulations as follows:1.
