RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today refused to kill alibel lawsuit against a Tennessee congressman who criticized alegal services lawyer.   The court, by a 6-3 vote, let stand a ruling that Rep. DonSundquist, R-Tenn., may be sued for statements he made in a newsrelease and in a letter to the U.S. attorney general.   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Harry A. Blackmun and Byron R.White voted to hear arguments in the case _ one vote short of thefour needed to grant such review.   Sundquist in January 1985 urged then-Atty. Gen. William FrenchSmith to investigate the Memphis Area Legal Services program andone of its lawyers, Wayne Chastain.   Sundquist said Chastain was trying to undermine efforts byjuvenile courts in the Memphis area to collect child-supportpayments.   Chastain and other lawyers in the legal services program since1978 had been involved in a dispute in which they said juvenilecourt procedures to collect the payments were violating the rightsof indigent parents.   In his letter to Smith, Sundquist said the legal servicesprogram ``seems to be employing at least one attorney, WayneChastain, to do nothing but harass'' juvenile court officials.   Sundquist said Smith should investigate ``allegedirregularities'' and the ``possibility of the obstruction'' of thelaw.   Chastain sued the congressman, charging that the letter and arelated news release defamed him.   A federal judge here threw out the suit, but it was reinstatedlast November by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.   The appeals court, in a 2-1 decision, said Sundquist'sstatements were not covered by the Constitution's speech or debateclause that shields members of Congress from lawsuits arising fromtheir official duties.   ``The speech or debate clause protects all lawmaking activitiesundertaken in the House and Senate, but affords no constitutionalimmunity beyond its carefully defined scope,'' the appeals courtsaid.   The appeals court relied heavily on a 1979 Supreme Court rulingthat permitted Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., to be sued over oneof his so-called ``Golden Fleece'' awards.   Proxmire had given one of the tongue-in-cheek awards to ascientist who conducted government-funded research the senator saidwas a waste of taxpayer money.   The appeals court here said the Proxmire case made it plain thatmembers of Congress do not enjoy absolute immunity from defamationsuits.   ``The speech or debate clause provides members of Congress withan immunity that is co-extensive with their constitutionalresponsibilities,'' the appeals court said.   ``When they move beyond the requirements of their legislativeresponsibilites, they do so as volunteers, and at their own risk,however important their myriad other activities may be in thetexture of contemporary political life,'' the appeals court said.   The ruling was written by Judge James L. Buckley, a formerRepublican senator from New York. Judge Abner Mikva, a formerDemocratic member of the House from Illinois, dissented.   Sundquist's appeal to the Supreme Court was supported bynumerous news media organizations, including the NationalAssociation of Broadcasters, the American Society of NewspaperEditors, the National Newspaper Association, the ReportersCommittee for Freedom of the Press, the Society of ProfessionalJournalists, Time Inc. and The Washington Post.   They told the justices, ``If members of Congress are forced toassess their risk of liability before they speak openly on issuesof public concern, the quality of public debate, in which the pressis an important participant, will be impoverished.''   The case is Sundquist vs. Chastain, 87-1756.</TEXT></DOC>
