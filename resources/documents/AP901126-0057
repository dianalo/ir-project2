The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that themagazines could be treated as imports from a foreign country oncethey were headed back to Cleveland.   Trans World News Co. of Cleveland shipped, on three occasions in1987, some 0,000 magazines to Canada for North American News inToronto. About 10,000 of the magazines were rejected at theCanadian border by officials who deemed them too sexually explicitand offensive to Canadian standards.   When those magazines were returned, Customs agents in westernNew York seized and confiscated 2,703 of them after determiningthey probably were obscene under the standards of that part of thecountry.   The magazines were seized under a federal law banning the importof obscene materials.   U.S. District Judge John T. Curtin in Buffalo upheld the seizureand confiscation despite arguments by Trans World News lawyers thatthe magazines were not imports because they never had reached theirCanadian destination.   The 2nd U.S. Circuit upheld Curtin's ruling last July. ``Whetherthe magazines were accepted into Canada or denied entry and held byCanadian Customs is irrelevant,'' the appeals court said.   It added: ``Regardless of their fate in Canada, theobjectionable publications were presented at the United Statesborder for entry into the United States from without when they wereseized.''   The case is 1903 Obscene Magazines vs. U.S., 90-642.</TEXT></DOC>
