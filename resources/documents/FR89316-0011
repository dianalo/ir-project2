The Office of Aircraft Services has determined that the clauseat FAR 52.228-10, Vehicular and General Public Libability Insurance, withminor revisions, is more appropriate than the current clause for establishingliability limits under the Department's aircraft services contracts withcontractor-furnished pilots. Therefore, this rule adopts the clause atFAR 52.228-10 for this purpose. The liability limits proposed in the clauseare the same as those prescribed by the Department of Transportation forair taxi operators providing air transportation to the public.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Regulatory FlexibilityAct</ITAG>The Department has determined that this rule is not a major rule underExecutive Order 12291 since it revises only existing limits of liabilityon contractors which provide aircraft services with pilot to the Departmentby adapting an existing clause prescribed in the FAR.The Department also certifies that this rule will not have a significanteffect on a substantial number of small entities since it will affect onlythose contractors which enter into fixed-price contracts with the Departmentfor aircraft services with furnished pilot.No information collection requirements are contained in the final rule.A proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 29, 1988 (53 FR 15432), inviting thepublic to submit written comments for the Department to consider in developingthe final rule.
