(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Have you ever gotten a postcard offering abargain-priced travel package? Or a phone call hawking a low-pricedvacation?   These might be legitimate, but be wary. Many are run by scamoperators who each year bilk victims of hundreds of millions ofdollars.   As a rule of thumb, if an offer sounds too good to be true, itis. Too often there is a catch and the innocent victim doesn'tfigure it out until it's too late. The scams take many forms buthere some of the most common identified by the Federal TradeCommission and the American Society of Travel Agents.   _You receive a phone call from a special operator, who isprepared to offer you what sounds like an unbelievably low-pricedtravel deal. You are told this is a very limited offer and you mustmake a decision, or at least make a deposit by credit card, duringthat initial phone conversation.   _You receive a postcard or brochure in the mail offering a dreamvacation at a bargain price. It may read something like this: ``Youhave been specially selected to receive a free trip...'' For moredetails, you must call a special number, usually toll-free. Oncethey've got you on the phone you will get the familiar high-pressurepitch. The object is to get you on the phone and then get you toreveal your credit-card number.   _You are urged to pay a ``travel club'' membership fee of $50 to$400 to get a travel package that includes round-trip airtransportation for one person and lodging for two. The catch? Youmust buy a high-priced, round-trip ticket for the second person; youcan end up paying two to three times what it would have cost if youbought your own tickets in advance through a reputable travel agency.   _A clever twist is the offer of a free or nearly free vacation asan inducement to visit a time-share condominium resort. Hiddencosts, which you learn about only when you arrive, tend to add upquickly. You can be herded into a high-pressure sales pitch, withlengthy in-person sales sessions calculated to break down yourresistance.   When the offer of a trip seems to be too good to be true, ask atravel agent about it. Agents can help you spot phony offers. Youalso may want to check with your local Better Business Bureau orChamber of Commerce, or with the Consumer Affairs Department of theAmerican Society of Travel Agents. These organizations keep recordsof complaints about fraudulent operations.   Even while you're talking to a telephone salesperson, there areways to protect yourself. Ask detailed questions to make certainwhat the price covers and what is not covered. Ask if there will beadditional charges later. Find out the names of the airports,airlines, hotels and restaurants your package includes. You may wishto contact these places yourself to double-check the arrangements.Ask about cancellation policies and refunds. If the salespersoncan't give you detailed answers, this is probably not the deal foryou.   The most important precaution you can take is never to give yourcredit card number over the phone. The easiest way for a scamoperator to succeed is to get your card number, then charge youraccount. Sometimes these operators will bluff by telling you theyneed the number for verification purposes only.   Make sure you get all information in writing before you agree tobuy anything. No legitimate business should expect you to make aninstant decision over the phone. Once you have all the informationin front of you, you can read the fine print and investigate thecompany. Bear in mind that many fraudulent firms change their namesfrequently to avoid detection.   When in doubt about an offer, either say no or demand fulldetails by mail. There is an endless array of exciting travelopportunities available to all, so you have nothing to lose bymaking sure you're getting what you pay for.   With today's selection of destinations, hotels, fares andcruises, you're sure to find a legitimate trip that meets both yourneeds and your budget.  </TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sept. 7</NOTE></DOC>
