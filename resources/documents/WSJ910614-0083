About 350 platinum-card carriers showed up, thrillingShearson officials. It was Shearson's first-of-its-kindattempt to tap the huge card list of its parent, AmericanExpress.</LP><TEXT>   A year after it nearly collapsed amid financial andmanagement turmoil -- forcing American Express to buy up 100%of the firm instead of pulling away as planned -- Shearson isclearly recuperating, although still struggling. At the sametime, it is trying to carve out its own identity within theAmerican Express family.   Shearson is still short of capital, and its broker ranksare depleted. Problems from the past keep resurfacing to raidits treasury; some of them are about to hand the firm itsfourth quarterly loss in the past six quarters, of about $30million.   But while it isn't making fat profits, the U.S.'ssecond-biggest brokerage firm has been slowly regaining itscustomers and, perhaps even more important, winning thehearts and minds of its own demoralized work force.   Insiders call the transformation process the &quot;Amexization&quot;of Shearson Lehman Brothers.   For example, Shearson is now giving out awards toemployees who show a &quot;commitment to quality service&quot;; eachincludes a trophy, a certificate from Chairman Howard L.Clark Jr. and a cash prize. There are even preliminary plansto give all 8,600 Shearson brokers free American Expressgreen cards, in exchange for reporting on restaurants thatdon't take them.   There are other signs of the new focus. Unlike most bigsecurities firms that take their cues from industry leaderslike Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., Shearson looks to corporateAmerica's service companies; at a recent brokers' seminar, itshowed the troops how-to videotapes from the chiefs of XeroxCorp. and Motorola Inc.   But some former Shearson executives say running thesecurities firm like any other company makes no sense. Theysay all the top American Express officials that are now insenior Shearson positions won't cut it on Wall Street.   &quot;They're not Streetwise anymore -- the firm is conductedlike an ordinary business corporation,&quot; says Philip J. HoblinJr., a former general counsel at Shearson who now works atParker Chapin Flattau andamp; Klimpl, a New York law firm.   In many ways, American Express is trying to mold Shearsonto be more like its successful middle-America IDSfinancial-planning unit: low-key and safe, relying on goodrelationships rather than rapid turnover of stocks and theunpredictability that brings.   Mr. Hoblin and other Wall Street veterans say it'sunrealistic for American Express to believe it can runShearson as a trouble-free firm, considering the volatilenature of the markets.   &quot;Nobody gets defrauded when you're paying $50 for a creditcard, but you can lose money in markets, causing people tothink they got defrauded,&quot; Mr. Hoblin says. American Expressofficials, he adds, &quot;don't like that image.&quot;   Shearson's new management insists the firm can have itboth ways. The notion that Shearson has lost its streetsmarts is &quot;ridiculous,&quot; says Mr. Clark, the chairman, who's aformer American Express chief financial officer. Mr. Clarkhas run Shearson since the ouster of Peter Cohen in early1990.   Still, some analysts believe all the moves, including thefostering of a separate identity for the Lehman Brothersinvestment-banking division, is American Express's attempt atprettying up the brokerage firm for an eventual sale. Itappears that Lehman Brothers, in particular, could one day bepartially spun off. Insists Mr. Clark: &quot;There are no plans toseparate the firm and spin out a portion of either division.There are no plans at all.&quot;   Among the other American Express influences: Everybroker's desk now has a little cardboard sign that spells outShearson's new principles, including the instruction to makeevery client feel &quot;special.&quot; Also, Shearson now has the onlybrokerage division on Wall Street with a &quot;quality officer&quot; --MaryAnne Rasmussen, who joined Shearson from a similarposition at American Express.   Some Shearson brokers aren't that wild about the littlecards on their desks. It seems that American Express is&quot;going to try to change the fast-talking nature of thebrokers with this card,&quot; says David H. Desmon, a veteranShearson broker in Buffalo, N.Y. &quot;It's kind of a joke,&quot; hesays. &quot;But it's important.&quot;   Just as important, says Jonathan Linen, Shearson'sbrokerage chief, is the intracompany cooperation thatAmerican Express is encouraging. The IDS unit is building upannuity products for Shearson to sell through the brokersystem. &quot;We're beginning to find ways to do things together,&quot;Mr. Linen says.   The one part of Shearson that American Express hasn'ttried to run like a travel company is the Lehman Brothersinvestment banking and trading operation. Instead, AmericanExpress has allowed Lehman to operate independently like thepartnership it used to be -- with separate profit-and-lossstatements, balance sheets, bonus schemes and business plans.   &quot;American Express understands that at Lehman Brothers,we're in a different business,&quot; says J. Tomilson Hill,Lehman's co-head. &quot;And they've done nothing to homogenize usor do anything but help us run our business better.&quot; LehmanBrothers, which says it had record first-quarter revenue,will even launch a separate advertising campaign for itselfthis year.   Shearson managers give American Express credit forinstilling more financial discipline. Steven Spiegel,president of the firm's European operations, Lehman BrothersInternational Ltd., is impressed that the firm is nowplanning for three years down the road, rather than just oneor two. &quot;The biggest change I've seen sitting here {inLondon} is that we've taken more of a strategic outlook onour businesses than we've had in the past.&quot;   Last year, Shearson's management found out first hand howlittle cost control was in place at the firm's 400 offices.In a study of 75 branches, per-broker costs varied from$18,000 in some branches to $90,000 in others, without regardfor location. Among the more outrageous costs found onShearson's tab: TV Guide subscriptions for some brokers.   Financial hurdles remain before Shearson will make healthyprofits. Shearson &quot;is thinly capitalized -- certainly asmeasured on a tangible equity basis,&quot; said Samuel G. Liss,brokerage analyst at Salomon Brothers, in a recent report.Shearson says it has $2 billion of equity capital and $500million of tangible net worth. &quot;You'd always like to havemore capital, and we'd like to have higher tangible networth,&quot; says Shearson's Mr. Clark.   Shearson is taking several steps to shore up its balancesheet. The company has taken a $144 million write-off of itsposition in First Capital Holdings Inc., the troubledCalifornia insurer. Shearson also plans to move the assets ofits Balcor Co. real estate unit to another American Expressaffiliate, jettison the mortgage company, and sell the U.K.mortgage portfolio of Shearson's Boston Co. money-managementunit. All these moves should remove $3 billion in higher-riskassets off Shearson's balance sheet.   Nevertheless, these and other exposures &quot;are large andhave the potential to pose a drag on {American Express}earnings in the future,&quot; said Guy Moszkowski, a Sanford C.Bernstein andamp; Co. analyst, in a recent report. &quot;In a harshscenario, Shearson {is} under-reserving totaling about $740million, or about $1.60 per American Express share.&quot; Acontinued drag on Shearson, some analysts add, is the vastamount of back-office operations capacity it has. &quot;We couldprobably double the capacity we're using without increasingthe staff,&quot; says one Shearson official.   Shearson also has public relations problems to overcome.The firm has been hit with a disproportionately high level ofinvestor complaints the past couple of years.   Of the 964 arbitration cases ruled on involving WallStreet firms in a nine-month period through early 1990, forinstance, fully 132 were against Shearson, according to theSecurities Arbitration Commentator, a Maplewood, N.J.,newsletter. More problematic, Shearson lost 78 of the cases-- 59% of them -- paying a total of $10.6 million in awards,the newsletter says, far higher than any other Wall Streetfirm.   By contrast, Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., the U.S.'s largestsecurities firm, lost 44 -- or 42% -- of the 104 casesagainst it in the same period, and paid a tad less than $2million in arbitration awards, the newsletter says.   Shearson executives blame the cascade of cases in part tothe 1988 acquisition of E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. &quot;We inherited a lotof big-ticket items from Hutton that distorted the numbers,&quot;says Theodore Krebsbach, Shearson's director of litigation.Mr. Krebsbach says the number of cases filed against Shearsonhas dropped in recent months, as have the awards Shearson hasbeen forced to dole out.   Indeed, Shearson's legal department has changed itstactics since American Express took over, Shearson attorneyssay. &quot;We're spending a lot more time looking at breaking downcomplaints, and finding out which brokers have multiplecomplaints&quot; filed against them, Mr. Krebsbach says. If theattorneys find a disturbing pattern, they can makerecommendations that the broker should be let go, Mr.Krebsbach says.   American Express already has taken steps to stem potentialproblems. Shearson brokers recently received a stern memolaying out strict guidelines for cold-calling, thoseunsolicited calls to prospective clients. (The old brokeragedivision of Lehman Brothers, which still operates as aseparate network within Shearson, long has been known on WallStreet for its aggressive cold-calling tactics.)   Among the edicts in the memo: Brokers must clearlyidentify themselves up front; disclose the purpose of thecall; not bother prospects before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m.; andget scripts approved by branch managers. As important:Brokers must be courteous and professional. &quot;Excessivepressure may not be used,&quot; the memo says. &quot;Rather, polite andpersuasive methods should be substituted.&quot;   Indeed, the guiding principles in the cold-calling memoseem to play off American Express's &quot;Membership Has ItsPrivileges&quot; ad campaign. &quot;Remember that a telephoneconversation is not a right,&quot; the memo says. &quot;It is aprivilege.&quot;   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          SHEARSON LEHMAN BROTHERS Inc. is expected to report asecond-quarter loss of $80 million to $95 million because ofa one-time charge, analysts say. The expected loss wasunderstated in Friday's edition.   (WSJ June 19, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
