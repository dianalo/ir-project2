The height-to-length ratio of the      thread bows directed downwardly is selected such that the loops when      wearing on the leg and in the case of leg movements serve to produce a      movement of the entire mesh article, e.g. sock, in the direction away from      the foot. The holding elements are formed as the meshes of a loop plush,      in which the loops serving as the holding elements are constituted by the      thread bows. This is achieved in simple manner in that at least part of      the meshes are formed from a plush thread and a basic thread, whereof the      mesh head is directed towards the edge of the sock while the holding      elements in the form of loops are directed towards the foot. Thus, the      sock can be manufactured as a loop plush. </PAL></ABST><PARN> <PAC>  CROSS REFERENCE TO A RELATED APPLICATION </PAC><PAR>  This is a continuation of co-pending application Ser. No. 07/368,025, filed      on Jun. 19, 1989, which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No.      049,137 filed May 12, 1987 which is now abandoned. </PAR></PARN><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to a sock in the form of a knitted mesh or      stitched article produced from threads, in which the mesh article has      concave holding elements as well as to a process for producing the sock. </PAR><PAR>  Socks having substantially elastic holding elements to prevent the sock      from slipping from the leg are known in numerous different forms. In most      constructions in the case of the mesh article in the form of a knitted      fabric additional threads are provided, which are made from a      rubber-elastic material or a stretch material. Although such a thread      material is able to ensure that the sock adheres to the leg, the      disadvantage exists that the leg is constricted due to the elasticity of      the thread material and as a result blood circulation is impeded. If such      a sock is worn for a long time, this can lead to a considerable      deterioration in the well-being of the wearer. </PAR><PAR>  In another known sock construction (EP 0 068 455), the described      disadvantage is avoided in that holding elements are formed on the inside      of the mesh article and have the form of a concave thread bow or arc      directed towards the foot part of the sock. In the case of leg movements      of the wearer, e.g. when walking, the circumference of the leg changes, so      that the thread bow is stretched and then relaxed again. However, as the      thread bow does not return to its original position and instead is higher,      this leads to an overall movement and consequently a tightening of the      mesh article away from the foot, so that during each leg circumference      change the sock is tensioned again. The important point is that this      smoothing of the mesh article leads to no constriction of the leg      circumference. The circulation of the blood is in no way impeded, but the      mesh article is still permanently smoothed and engaged in creaseless      manner on the wearer's leg. </PAR><PAR>  However, the production of such thread bows on the mesh article of the      known type is relatively complicated, which has made it difficult to put      into practical use. </PAR><PAR>  In an earlier application Serial No. 393,024 filed Jun. 28, 1982 and      thereafter abandoned after appeal, applicant suggested socks with holding      arrangements including convexly curved holding elements formed by single      threads and provided on at least a portion of the sock body. The socks      produced in accordance with that earlier patent application did not,      however, provide a substantial stretch and tightening effect without use      of rubber bands. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  It is an object of the present invention to form a sock of the      aforementioned type which, whilst retaining the mesh article tightening      effect, permits a significant increase in the production rate. </PAR><PAR>  According to the invention this and other objects are attained by a sock      having a knitted thread mesh structure comprising an edge stop; a knitted      border disposed adjacent the stop and secured thereto; a heel, a sock foot      secured to the heel, the sock foot terminating in a tip; and an elongated      sock leg secured at one end to the border and at the other end to the      heel, said sock leg being formed of thread meshes each mesh employing two      threads, one thread being a basic thread and the other thread having a      plush thread forming a loop plush, said meshes including mesh heads      directed away from said tip and towards said edge stop, and concave      holding elements in the form of exposed thread bows forming mesh loops,      said loops being directed towards said tip and away from said edge stop,      said exposed thread bows having a length in the direction parallel to a      transversal direction of the sock leg and a height in the direction of      elongation of the sock leg, and wherein a height-to-length ratio of said      thread bows is in the range between 0.2 and 0.75. </PAR><PAR>  The holding elements are appropriately meshes formed from double threads,      whereof one thread forms part of the basic knitted fabric and the other      thread is the plush thread forming the loop. It is advantageous, as a      function of the thread material used for producing the mesh article, for      the loops to be formed in each mesh or in every other mesh of the knitted      fabric. </PAR><PAR>  In an embodiment, each mesh contains holding elements loops. </PAR><PAR>  In another embodiment, every other mesh contains holding element loops. </PAR><PAR>  In a further embodiment, the sock leg is composed of two mesh layers, one      layer being an inner layer, the other layer being an outer layer, the      inner layer being at least partially in loop plush form with holding      elements or loops. The outer layer may cover the loops of the inner layer. </PAR><PAR>  In an embodiment, parts of the inner mesh layer provided with loops is      covered by the outer layer formed from knitted bindings of a random type. </PAR><PAR>  In order to produce socks having a knitted mesh structure including an edge      stop, a knitted border disposed adjacent the stop and secured thereto, a      heel, a sock foot secured to the heel, the sock foot terminating in a tip,      and an elongated sock leg secured at one end to the border and at the      other end to the heel, wherein the sock leg is formed of thread meshes,      each mesh employing two threads, one thread being a basic thread and the      other thread being a plush thread forming a loop plush and the meshes      including mesh heads directed away from the tip and towards said edge stop      and concave holding elements in the form of exposed thread bows forming      mesh loops, the loops being directed towards said tip and away from said      edge stop, a new process is suggested, in which the knitting process is      started from the binding-off zone, following the knitting of a toe, the      foot, the heel, the sock leg, the sock border and ending the knitting at      the edge stop of the sock, and in the step of knitting the sock le the      ratio between the height and the length of exposed thread bows forming      mesh loops is selected to be in the range between 0.2 and 0.75. </PAR><PAR>  The sock or mesh article having holding elements shaped according to the      present invention enables a movement of the mesh article away from the      foot during wearer's leg movements so that a rubber band at the welt of      the sock can be omitted. </PAR><PAR>  The aforementioned objects, features and advantages of the invention will,      in part, be pointed out with particularity, and will, in part, become      obvious from the following more detailed description of the invention,      taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing, which form an integral      part thereof. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a diagrammatically represented side view of a sock produced in      the known manner; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a diagrammatically represented side view of a sock according to      the invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a perspective exploded view illustrating the production of the      sock according to the invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 illustrates a detail of the mesh article of a sock according to FIG.      2 with a loop constituting the holding element in each mesh; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 shows a detail from a mesh article with holding elements in loop      form in every other mesh, wherein the holding elements form concave thread      bows directed towards the foot of the sock; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a diagrammatically represented section through a sock with a      double-layer mesh article in the leg, in which the inside mesh article has      holding elements formed as concave thread bows directed towards the sock      foot and wherein a predetermined height-to-length ratio of the concave      thread bows is shown. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 shows a sock 1, e.g. for men in diagrammatic form and which is      knitted in known manner as loop plush. The knitting process begins at end      A of sock leg 2 with a normal edge stop and then in B the sock border is      knitted and in it are placed elastic, e.g. rubber threads. This is      followed at a C by the sock leg, in which different knitted bindings are      knitted in, followed by heel D and finally foot E, which can also be      knitted with plush loops. The sock toe or tip F is then knitted in the      same way as heel D. G is the binding-off zone, which is used for closing      the toe and then the knitting process is ended. </PAR><PAR>  In sock leg C the knitted fabric is shown on a larger scale in a window. It      is typical that mesh heads 3 and the loops 5 simultaneously knitted with a      plush thread 4 are directed away from the sock foot towards the sock edge      A. </PAR><PAR>  The invention is based on the idea that it would be appropriate for      achieving a high production capacity, if the same knitting process could      be used for producing the loop plush, so that the holding elements formed      from the thread bows could be knitted in the same way with meshes, and as      a result of the specific shaping of the thread meshes as will be described      hereinafter, the tightening function of the sock leg 2 would be reliably      achieved. </PAR><PAR>  It has surprisingly been found that this objective can be achieved by      reversing the knitting process and, at the same time, by selecting a      predetermined height-to-length ratio of the loops which serve as holding      elements. This is illustrated in FIG. 2 with a sock 10, in which the      knitting begins at zone I, i.e. in the binding-off zone, and then,      following the knitting of toe II, foot III, heel IV, sock leg V, sock      border VI, ends at edge VII. The knitted fabric is shown on a larger scale      in the window in sock leg V. According to the invention and as a result of      the reversed knitting process the mesh heads 3' are directed upwards,      whereas the loops 5' are directed downwards towards the foot of the sock.      The reversed knitting process and a predetermined height-to-length ratio      of loops 5' as will be explained in connection with FIG. 6, make it      possible to give the loops the form of thread bows which, on changing the      leg circumference, e.g. when walking, move in the direction of edge VII      and therefore fulfill the sock tightening function. The effect of      so-shaped thread bows is so substantial that rubber bands at the sock edge      can be dispensed of. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 shows the known plush production, which is now also used for      producing the inventive sock. From a basic thread 11 and a plush thread 4      double meshes 13 are knitted by means of knitting needles 14, whilst by      means of plush thread 4 using plush plates 14 the loops are formed as      holding elements 5 of a predetermined shape. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 4 and 5 show two knitted fabrics with downwardly directed holding      elements in the form of loops 5: which are interengaged with and      positioned inwardly of mesh heads 3' of the previous row. In the knitted      fabric according to FIG. 4, the loops 5&quot; constituting the holding elements      are knitted in each mesh while in the arrangement of FIG. 5 holding      elements 5&quot; are knitted in every other mesh. The knitted fabric according      to FIG. 4 has a mesh structure suitable for knitting a wool sock, whilst      the knitted fabric according to FIG. 5 has a mesh structure with which      appropriately a cotton sock is knitted. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 schematically illustrates a selected or predetermined ratio between      the height h of the loops formed by threaded bows 5 and their length 1.      This ratio in accordance with the invention is between 0.2 and 0.75. This      ratio in combination with the reverse direction of knitting provides a      surprising stretching-tightening effect so that in case the sock was      unintentionally pulled down the leg portion moves back in the upward      direction as a sock wearer walks or swings the leg. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 further shows the sock mesh which is formed in the sock leg with two      superimposed knitted fabrics 23, 24. The inner knitted fabric 24 is      produced in such a way that on inverting into the interior of sock 20 it      has the same loops 5 in the form of concave holding elements directed      towards the sock foot as in the embodiment of FIG. 2. The outer knitted      fabric 23 can have a random mesh structure. The foot can also be knitted      with a different mesh structure. In spite of this, as a result of the      inner knitted fabric 24 with the loops 5 constituting holding elements,      the tightening function of the sock is ensured. </PAR><PAR>  Due to the fact that the holding elements exerting the tightening function      of the sock 1, 10, 20 are constructed as specially shaped loops 5, it is      possible to produce the sock in a rational manner, expenditure being no      greater than when producing a normal loop plush. </PAR><PAR>  The sock can be made without rubber in its welt but will yet maintain its      tightening function without impeding blood circulation of the sock wearer.      If the thread is of wool no preparation of the same is necessary since its      natural elasticity is sufficient. However, a cotton thread changes its      length substantially (up to 40% of the normal length) if it becomes moist      and loses its contact with the leg. To avoid this the thread may be made      more resilient artificially, e.g. as for crimped or stretched yarn.      However, this is suggested only for securing surface pressure contact in      all situations. Synthetic yarns may be also made somewhat resilient to      ensure sock-leg contact in all situations. </PAR><PAR>  There has been disclosed heretofore the best embodiment of the invention      presently contemplated. However, it is to be understood that various      changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the      spirit of the invention. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
