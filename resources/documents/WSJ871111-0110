BarnesStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/11/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CBSTELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Earle H. &quot;Kim&quot; LeMasters, then a CBS Inc. programming vice president, was in typical form when he came to New York last month to meet with top CBS officials about the network's progress this season.    When he learned at the session that CBS's president and chief executive officer, Laurence A. Tisch, was going to give CBS News an extra hour per week of prime-time programming for airing documentaries, he told the boss bluntly that he didn't like it, because news programs usually don't get big ratings.    &quot;How do you expect us to be No. 1 with so much news in prime time?&quot; was the essence of his remarks to Mr. Tisch, officials who were present said. &quot;It was a spirited exchange,&quot; says one CBS official. &quot;But he held his own.&quot; However, Mr. Tisch was unswayed.    Mr. LeMaster's trademark bluntness was one factor that helped him win appointment Monday as president of CBS Entertainment, one of the most powerful, and turbulent, positions in network television. That &quot;is Larry's (own) style, of course,&quot; a person close to Mr. Tisch said.    Now Mr. LeMasters -- who confidently believed he would one day get the top programming post at the network, friends say -- gets his chance to try reviving CBS's stagnant ratings, a task his predecessor and former boss, B. Donald Grant, failed at. After seven years in the post, and amid widespread rumors that he was about to be replaced, Mr. Grant resigned Oct. 30 to form his own television production company.    In his new post, Mr. LeMasters will decide which new programs to buy and when to run them. The fortunes of the network ride on those decisions.    In naming Mr. LeMasters to succeed Mr. Grant, Mr. Tisch chose a tough, driven television executive whose hands-on, independent and abrupt style hasn't won him a legion of fans in Hollywood. More than one CBS executive recalls overhearing the boyish-looking Mr. LeMasters, who turns 38 years on Monday, rudely dealing on the phone with senior executives of television studios trying to sell him programs.    &quot;I do speak my mind. In my opinion, it's better to do that and get it all out on the table, than carry it around,&quot; Mr. LeMasters acknowledges, adding: &quot;One thing I'd like to better myself at is how to say no and keep people in the community wanting to do business with CBS.&quot;    Mr. LeMasters isn't your typical television tycoon. His first job after graduating in 1971 from the University of California, Los Angeles, with a history degree was as a trainee with the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange. He claims Alexander Hamilton as a relative; his stepfather was a member of the John Birch Society.    Unlike colleagues who drive fancy sports cars to work, Mr. LeMasters drives a Chevrolet Blazer. He lives in a secluded spot near the Hollywood Reservoir in Los Angeles, and jealously guards his privacy and details of his family life. He is married and has three children.    &quot;He is very much a man's man,&quot; says Jay Bernstein, producer of CBS's &quot;Houston Knights.&quot; &quot;He's into a lot of sports -- shotguns, shooting clay pigeons -- all that sort of stuff.&quot; He rarely attends splashy Hollywood functions, Mr. Bernstein notes.    Some Hollywood officials say his tough management style was inspired by Niccolo Machiavelli's &quot;The Prince.&quot; Mr. LeMasters laughs off the charge, but acknowledges he studied the work as part of a college term paper.    Mr. LeMasters, who joined CBS in 1976, has held a variety of network programming positions. He is credited with bringing &quot;Dallas,&quot; &quot;Magnum, P.I.,&quot; &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; and other CBS hits to the network. In the current season, CBS's top-rated new show, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was a LeMasters project.    In his most recent job as vice president, programs, he was an architect of CBS's decision to replace eight of 22 hours of weekly prime-time programs in the current season, the most ever for the network. With CBS currently in third place in the ratings because of strong sports programming on the rival networks, the strategy has had mixed results so far.    &quot;Patience with a capital P,&quot; urges Mr. LeMasters, who says he wants to have the network in position to overtake first-ranked National Broadcasting Co. by the 1989 season. </TEXT></DOC>
