During his speech opening the ANC's national conventionyesterday, some of the loudest applause came when he said theANC army &quot;has a responsibility to keep itself in a state ofreadiness in case the forces of counterrevolution once moreblock the path to a peaceful transition to a democraticsociety.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Setting a tough tone at the organization's first fullconference inside the country in three decades, ANC DeputyPresident Mandela also told the delegates the organizationneeds to convince the world not to relax sanctions againstSouth Africa, so as not to &quot;lose this weapon which we willneed until a democratic constitution has been adopted.&quot;   Many of the 2,000 delegates gathered in a university fieldhouse in Durban believe the ANC has given up too much duringits pro-democracy talks with the South African government.Even members of the ANC's executive committee have expressedworries that excessive faith may have been placed in SouthAfrican President F.W. de Klerk and negotiations.   Mr. de Klerk recently called on the ANC to terminate, notjust suspend as it has, armed actions against the apartheidgovernment. Mr. Mandela rejected that suggestion. In fact, headded that Umkhonto We Sizwe, the ANC army, should &quot;make itsexpertise available&quot; to violence-plagued black communitiessetting up self-defense units.   Mr. Mandela, who once called Mr. de Klerk a &quot;man ofintegrity,&quot; accused the de Klerk government &quot;of talking peacewhile actually conducting war.&quot; The ANC doubts Pretoria's&quot;good faith when it sits paralyzed as the security forces itcontrols themselves engage in violence against the people,permit such violence to occur and remain immune fromprosecution when there is clear evidence of their involvementor connivance at the murder of innocent people,&quot; he said.   Mr. Mandela's call for continued sanctions comes as theSouth African media bring almost daily reports of thegovernment's growing international acceptance. ANC officialsacknowledge they haven't done a good enough job spreading theword that apartheid practices continue even as the governmentterminates some, but not all, race-based laws.   U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat who is partof a small U.S. delegation here, told the gathering theCongressional Black Caucus believes the South Africangovernment hasn't done enough to justify the removal of U.S.sanctions against Pretoria. The caucus lobbied against theirremoval at a June 25 meeting with President Bush. In aninterview, Ms. Waters said, &quot;The president is anxious torelax sanctions.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
