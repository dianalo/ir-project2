The two haven't had lawyers representing them since their sentencing for murder, until two weeks ago, when their cases came to the attention of Robert L. McGlasson, a staff lawyer with the Southern Prisoners Defense Committee, based in Atlanta.    Mr. McGlasson, who wasn't previously familiar with the cases, began working frantically on pleadings. On Tuesday, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist stayed the executions for 30 days to allow time for lawyers to file appeals.    Mr. McGlasson and New Orleans lawyer Jim Rebholtz, who represent several death-row inmates in the South, only arrived here recently at the University of Texas School of Law. They came on a mission to organize a system for recruiting lawyers to represent Texas death-row inmates. But organizing, a longer-term effort, has taken a back seat to dealing with emergencies such as this one.    In a nation with a glut of lawyers, there is a severe shortage of those willing to take capital-crime cases. The population on death row is at its highest ever. There have been 19 executions so far this year, and four are scheduled in three states tomorrow, pending last-minute stays.    Some death-penalty opponents had hoped that a favorable Supreme Court ruling on an appeal of states' capital punishment laws would stay hundreds of sentences. But in April the court turned down the appeal, which was based on statistical studies in Georgia that showed killers of whites were far more likely to be sentenced to death than killers of blacks. The court rejected the argument that the statistical evidence proved an individual defendant's rights had been violated.    The case was considered the last broad constitutional challenge to the death penalty. Because the high court wouldn't categorically rule out the death penalty, opponents now have the more onerous task of fighting sentences in individual cases. It is a job that not many members of the bar have a taste for -- they don't want to defend such people, and they make little money at it, if any. But the lawyer shortage in this area raises so many troubling questions about the integrity of the legal system that even judges, who are now realizing the extent of the problem, have begun to recruit attorneys for the task.    The popular perception is that the system guarantees a condemned person a lawyer. But most states provide counsel only for the trial and the automatic review of the sentence by the state appeals court. Indigent prisoners -- a description that applies to just about everybody on death row -- who seek further review must rely on the charity of a few private lawyers and on cash-starved organizations like the Southern Prisoners Defense Committee and Team Defense Project Inc., also based in Atlanta.    Often, the appeals have merit. Despite the neglect of the legal profession, the post-conviction appeal process is not a frivolous exercise, said Judge John Godbold, who sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit (including Georgia, Alabama and Florida). Judge Godbold, in a speech last spring urging New York lawyers to volunteer for death-row work, said that after the 11th Circuit was created in 1981, the death sentence was overturned in half of the court's first 56 cases because of constitutional questions. &quot;I would make a horseback guess that now a third of (death-penalty) cases have constitutional error of such dimension that the petitioner is entitled to an order&quot; overturning the sentence, he added.    Thorough review of death sentences is in the public interest, and adequate review requires effective counsel, says Judge Alvin Rubin, a nine-year veteran of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which includes Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.    A person facing execution &quot;ought not to have some stumblebum who's drunk and all the time hanging around the courthouse hoping to collect a $10 fee,&quot; he says, referring to the common notion of court-appointed lawyers in such cases. Judge Rubin is part of an ad hoc effort to persuade state and federal judges in the circuit to seek out and appoint competent lawyers for post-conviction appeals.    Prodding by judges is partly responsible for a spate of projects around the nation designed to recruit and train lawyers for death-penalty work.    The American Bar Association has funded a recruitment project, state bars and volunteer groups are organizing resource centers to recruit and train lawyers, and partners of some prestigious New York firms are using peer pressure to persuade other blue-chip firms to help out. New York's Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton andamp; Garrison filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Virginia death-row inmates in an attempt to force the state to provide counsel for post-conviction appeals. Florida, whose 267 condemned prisoners make up the nation's largest death row, is the only state to set up an agency devoted solely to handling death-penalty appeals.    Taken together, however, such efforts haven't been effective, although they allow states and private firms to say they have made some contribution. In fact, say some death-penalty opponents, the efforts are somewhat like the hood provided to a person strapped to an electric chair. &quot;It does absolutely nothing for the prisoner, but it spares the rest of us from having to watch the contortions on his face as he dies,&quot; says Millard Farmer, Team Defense director.    Among the reasons lawyers aren't coming forward, particularly in the South where the need is greatest, say death-penalty opponents, are political considerations. The region's large law firms fear offending paying clients if they represent someone who has committed a horrible crime, they say.    Georgia has added an additional obstacle to such service. State Attorney General Mike Bowers has dictated a conflict-of-interest policy that forbids any member of a law firm with a state legal services contract from representing death-row inmates, who have been prosecuted by the state. A case currently pending before the 11th Circuit may result in an overruling of that policy.    The expense of handling a death-penalty case also discourages volunteers. For example, had the New York firm Paul Weiss been paid for the work it did in the unsuccessful effort several years ago to save Texas inmate Charlie Brooks, it would have been due $149,363.10 for its time and $18,087 for expenses, says partner Jay Topkis.    So far, the firm has contributed $312,579 in time and put out $103,637 in expenses for Louisiana inmate Ronald Monroe, said Mr. Topkis.    The nation has many law firms that can absorb the expenses, but some claim a lack of expertise. That is not a good excuse, Mr. McGlasson argues. Most lawyers, with proper coaching from experienced death-penalty counsels, can do a very good job, he says.    The shortage of lawyers for these cases is most acute in Texas, ranked second to Florida with 248 people awaiting execution. The scarcity of lawyers is just one part of a situation described by death-penalty opponents and some judges in the state as &quot;chaotic.&quot; Unlike some other states, where death-penalty opponents have set up clearinghouses to monitor the status of inmates, Texas has nobody watching out for condemned inmates. As a result, last May an inmate came within hours of execution because no one had informed him about his appeal deadline.    &quot;One of the biggest problems is the lack of information,&quot; says Mr. McGlasson. He and Mr. Rebholtz have discovered inmates who aren't sure whether they have lawyers because they haven't heard from anyone in a long time. They recently spoke to a prisoner who didn't have a lawyer, but was adamant that he hadn't been scheduled for execution. In fact, a date had been set for the end of the month. A judge granted an extension. In another instance, Mr. Rebholtz persuaded a Wisconsin lawyer to take a Texas case, but he couldn't locate the inmate's trial record.    Additionally, Messrs. Rebholtz and McGlasson often work against the deadline of a scheduled execution date when &quot;it's almost impossible&quot; to recruit a volunteer lawyer.    They hope for a system in Texas under which judges would make appointments of counsel for post-conviction appeals, rather than a state agency such as Florida's, which is too small for the number of cases handled. In addition to curbing the expense to the state, says Mr. McGlasson, there is an urgent need to spread out the emotional burden of death-penalty work now borne by a relatively small number of lawyers.    &quot;Death penalty work drives people crazy,&quot; Mr. McGlasson says.    &quot;There isn't a person in this office who hasn't quit two or three times, including myself,&quot; says Larry Spaulding, director of the Florida agency, Capital Collateral Representative. Lawyers work 65 to 100 hours a week and, he says, &quot;there is the pressure that no matter how hard you work, your client is going to be executed. We've lost a couple of people who were not able to deal with that,&quot; he says.    ---   Death Row   Inmates awaiting execution    Florida              267    Texas                248    California           200    Illinois             109    Georgia              108   Source: NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
