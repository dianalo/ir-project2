So why can't soccer golf win a following, wonders Albert O. Fenyvessy.    The 78-year-old retired real-estate developer from Rochester, N.Y., has been trying, to no avail, to groom soccer-golf devotees for the past three decades.    Soccer golf consists of a series of nets spaced a couple of hundred feet apart -- on par with golf-course holes -- and each net is suspended five feet off the ground on a tripod. The player kicks a soccer ball to each net and then hoists the ball, by foot, into the net, with as few kicks as possible.    Mr. Fenyvessy was encouraged initially. After inventing the sport in 1957, he wrote to the late Dr. Paul Dudley White, a noted cardiologist, who endorsed the game as a balanced and safe exercise. Mr. Fenyvessy then convinced Rochester officials to let him set up a few nets in a city park. He was the only one who played, however.    &quot;I thought I must be crazy, so I quit,&quot; he says. But when the fitness craze gained momentum in the 1980s, Mr. Fenyvessy decided to have another swing at promoting the sport. &quot;Soccer golf didn't seem any crazier than jogging,&quot; he says.    He hosted the First Annual Soccer Golf Tournament at the University of Rochester stadium in 1982. Although four-player teams from five area colleges were to compete, only three teams showed up. There's yet to be a second tournament.    Last year, he bought a quarter-page ad in the Washington Post's weekly edition to extol the benefits of soccer-golf: It's a &quot;priceless, no-nonsense sport, powerfully simple with no fancy trappings.&quot; The ad included the number for the soccer-golf hot line, but only two people called.    He even offered to donate $2,000 to the Republican Party if he could hold a soccer-golf demonstration, with President Reagan attending, on the White House south lawn. The president, the White House replied, is too busy.    Locally, he spent $1,000 for two pilots to pull banners reading &quot;Try Soccer Golf, not Drugs&quot; and &quot;Try Soccer Golf, Rochester's Own Sport&quot; over the city. Now he's offered to give $25,000 in soccer-golf equipment to any group willing to use it.    Still, the game remains virtually unknown. &quot;Gosh, I've never heard of it,&quot; says Michael Roche, parks program coordinator for Monroe County, where Mr. Fenyvessy lives. &quot;If anyone cared about it, I think I would have heard.&quot;    Mr. Fenyvessy remains undaunted. &quot;I don't think I should give up now. I may try Buffalo.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
