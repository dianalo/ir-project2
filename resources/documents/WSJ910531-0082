But Mr. Prochnow has an even better idea: He wants theSoviets to be required to use such aid first of all to payoff their debts to U.S. companies such as his, which is stillwaiting for payment on more than $30 million in box-makingequipment it delivered last year. Mr. Prochnow says hiscompany has been lobbying Wisconsin's two senators to pushfor precisely such an aid policy toward the Soviet Union.</LP><TEXT>   The Zerand Bernal case aptly illustrates the strongpolitical and economic cross-currents that are beginning tobuffet President Bush as he confronts the Soviets' new pleafor a big dose of Western aid in return for fundamentaleconomic reforms. Today, Mr. Bush meets envoys from SovietPresident Mikhail Gorbachev to discuss the Kremlin'sproblems.   Mr. Bush remains sympathetic to Mr. Gorbachev and wouldlike to find a way to help. And in the weeks ahead, allies inEurope, agriculture and business interests at home andforeign-policy experts fearful of chaos in the Soviet Unionall will clamor for him to do something.   But at the same time, there is deep skepticism within Mr.Bush's own administration about the wisdom of investing inthe horrid Soviet economy on the basis of another set ofpromised economic reforms. Administration aides wereskeptical of reform plans outlined here this week by aspecial group of Soviet economic emissaries; U.S. officialsargued the Soviet Union should count heavily on its own vastresources rather than outside aid.   Moreover, a bipartisan cross-section of political figures,who don't agree on much else, are urging Mr. Bush to holdback. &quot;I think our actions should be in response to actions,not in response to promises,&quot; says Democratic Sen. BillBradley of New Jersey, who has focused heavily on the Sovieteconomy.   Sen. Bradley argues that, besides skepticism about theability of the Gorbachev regime to make fundamental economicchanges, the U.S. should be leery because of continuingpolitical repression in the Soviet Union. And, he argues, abig aid deal now would &quot;bolster the elites at a time whenthere is a growing grass-roots democracy&quot; in the SovietUnion.   As such arguments suggest, the aid issue could be a bigpolitical headache for Mr. Bush. Like the president's recentdecision to extend China's favorable trade status, the aiddebate could give some Democratic presidential contenders abadly needed chance to stake out what they can portray as amore hard-nosed position than Mr. Bush in his strongest area,foreign policy.   &quot;The only way these guys have any place to go is to get tothe right of Bush on defense and foreign policy,&quot; says FrankGaffney, head of the conservative Center for Security Policyand a vociferous opponent of aiding the Soviets. &quot;Thishappens to be the ideal vehicle for guys like Bradley.&quot;   For now, Mr. Bush is trying to sound open and sympatheticto the Soviet plea for help, while avoiding making any realfinancial commitment. But it is clear from candid commentsthe president has made in recent days that, whatever his headmay be telling him about Mr. Gorbachev's failed economicpolicies so far, his heart still tells him that the Sovietleader is a helpful partner in world politics who also wantsto do the right thing at home.   &quot;As you all know, I guess if I'm criticized on the Sovietrelationship it's for staying what some would say is tooclose to Gorbachev,&quot; Mr. Bush said in a chat with reporterswhile he vacationed in Maine this week. &quot;I don't think so. Ithink our administration is on the right path here, and I'mnot about to forget the significant reforms already taken inthe Soviet Union.&quot;   Mr. Bush appears to be preparing to offer some modest helpto the Soviets. He seems likely, perhaps as early as today,to renew a waiver of legal restrictions on trade with theSoviet Union, opening the way for the Soviets to get graincredits and export financing. Mr. Bush also may give theSoviets most favored nation trading status and move to ratifya trade treaty now that the Soviets have passed a newemigration law. And his administration is likely to push forspecial observer status for the Soviets at the World Bank.   The Soviets, though, are trying to force Mr. Bush to offermore, and soon. Soviet officials began several weeks agotalking about their &quot;grand deal,&quot; in which the Kremlin wouldlay out a detailed plan of drastic market reforms in returnfor a giant commitment of Western aid that might total $25billion to $30 billion a year.   Mr. Gorbachev would like to be invited to the Julyeconomic summit of industrialized nations to discuss thisconcept. And just this week, a group of Gorbachev envoysarrived in Washington to explain Soviet reform plans toadministration officials.   Yet Mr. Bush is in an awkward position, because hisadministration has all but declared the Soviet Union to be apoor credit risk. That was the verdict the administrationrendered when Mr. Gorbachev asked in March for $1.5 billionin agricultural credits to buy American grain. Instead ofgranting the request, Mr. Bush sent a team of Americananalysts to Moscow to find some other ways to help alleviatedisruptions in the Soviet food supply.   In many ways, the debate over grain credits has been amicrocosm of the broader, looming debate over generaleconomic aid to the Soviets. And the grain debate also aptlyillustrated what strange political bedfellows the issue iscreating.   When the Senate debated a resolution supporting theextension of credits for grain purchases with some conditionsattached, the fight for helping the Soviets was led by SenateRepublican leader Robert Dole, a conservative who clearly waslooking out for his wheat-producing home state of Kansas.   He was joined in his fight by, among others, Sen. CarlLevin, a liberal Democrat from the industrial state ofMichigan, who was more worried about preventing aconservative backlash in the Soviet Union.   &quot;We who support this resolution argue that hunger andchaos within the Soviet Union will only strengthen the handof the hard-line forces which yearn to smother the light offreedom in the Baltics, Armenia and elsewhere,&quot; Sen. Levinargued.   Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), who heads the SenateAgriculture Committee, was just as firmly opposed. He arguedthat the Soviets are so unlikely to be able to repay thecredits that any money lent them would amount to simpleforeign aid.   Some U.S. businesses can attest to the Soviet inability topay debts. The Commerce Department says the Soviets are inarrears on debts of more than $100 million owed to U.S.companies. Yet U.S. businessmen, wary of being left behindforeign competitors if the Soviets succeed in turning theireconomy around, are likely to press for the U.S. to be partof any Western recovery plan for the Soviet economy.   &quot;There's no question in my mind it's in our interest toget normal relations with the Soviets and to help them in anyway we can,&quot; says Donald Kendall, recently retired chairmanof the executive committee of PepsiCo Inc., which makes softdrinks in the Soviet Union and imports Soviet vodka.   Mr. Kendall is pushing particularly hard for the Bushadministration to grant the Soviet Union most favored nationtrading status now that the Soviets have met the Americandemand that they enact a liberalized emigration law. Hethinks remaking the Soviet economy will take longer thanSoviet officials realize but that &quot;it'll happen if we give alot of support to it.&quot;   In the end, the political debate in the U.S. may turn, ashave so many U.S.-Soviet issues in recent years, on how muchfaith American officials decide they can place in MikhailGorbachev. &quot;You have to feel there is management in placethat can make it work,&quot; says Republican Sen. Nancy Kassebaumof Kansas. &quot;That is going to be the key.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
