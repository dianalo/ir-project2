The decisions came as the chamber began a second week of work ona bill authorizing the Pentagon budget for the next fiscal year.   First, the Democratic-controlled House voted 276-92 to block thesending of any combat troops into, or over, Nicaragua.   A similar ban had been approved by the House in each of the pasttwo years. But it had been changed by a House-Senate conferencecommittee to simply make it a ``sense of the Congress'' resolutionand say the ban didn't affect a president's constitutional power ascommander-in-chief.   Rep. Thomas Foley, D-Wash., the House majority leader, sponsoredthe proposal.   He noted that President Reagan has repeatedly stated the UnitedStates has no intention of invading Nicaragua, where U.S.-backedContra guerrillas are now conducting peace talks with the leftistleaders of Nicaragua's Sandinista government.   ``It may seem to some wise to reaffirm this intention on thepart of the administration and Congress not to maintain any threatof intervention,'' said Foley.   But Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said, ``this perennial amendment isstill unconstitutional, in my judgement. I don't think we canrepeal the power of the president to be commander-in-chief.''   Before passing the Foley proposal, the House voted 336-21approval of an amendment by Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., whichsaid U.S. forces could be sent into Nicaragua to respond to ahijacking, a kidnapping, or other acts of terrorism against U.S.citizens or citizens of a U.S. ally.   Then, the House rejected, 238-147, an amendment by Rep. EdwardMarkey, D-Mass., that would block U.S. personnel who are assistingthe Contras from being within 20 miles of the Nicaraguan border.The prohibition would specifically apply to U.S. military exercises.   The Pentagon has conducted a series of exercises in Honduras,which shares a border with Nicaragua. But U.S. personnel havegenerally stayed away from the border.   The House also rejected, 267-111, an attempt to delete the $3million in the bill which would go for Army construction plans inHonduras.   The Senate is expected next week to begin considering itsversion of a Pentagon budget bill, and the provisions thatseparately pass the two chambers will eventually have to bereconciled by a House-Senate conference committee.   Both the House and Senate measures authorize $299.5 billion indefense spending for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. But the Househas already added three nuclear arms control restrictions stronglyopposed by Reagan, in addition to the Foley proposal.   More restrictions are likely as the House continues to workthrough the bill, including a deep reduction from Reagan's requestfor spending on his Star Wars anti-missile research plan.   Reagan sought $4.8 billion for the plan, but the House billwould permit $4.0 billion, while the Senate measure allows $4.6billion. The current budget is $3.9 billion for the StrategicDefense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known.</TEXT></DOC>
