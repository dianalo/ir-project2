Prices of wheat and soybean futures contracts rose in thinpre-holiday trading amid speculation that the creation of acommonwealth might begin to clear away some of the confusionover who controls U.S. grain shipments to the republics.</LP><TEXT>   Traders are also speculating that the White House mightaccelerate its allocation of previously approved grain-buyingcredit guarantees in order to lend support to the republics.   The wheat contract for March delivery touched alife-of-contract high during the session yesterday at theChicago Board of Trade, before settling at $3.985 a bushel,up eight cents a bushel.   The soybean contract for January delivery rose seven centsa bushel to settle at $5.6375 a bushel. Corn prices weremixed.   The former Soviet Union has already exhausted about halfof the $1.25 billion package of credit guarantees awarded bythe U.S. in November. Much of the credit guarantees were usedby the Soviets to arrange bank loans to finance a Decemberbuying spree of U.S. wheat.   The remainder of the credit guarantees were slated tobecome available to the region in February, March and April.Some traders are reasoning that the Bush administration mightmake some of the remaining credit guarantees available to therepublics in January.   The price of the March wheat contract was also supportedby purchases by chartwatching commodity fund managers. TheMarch contract became the spot month with the expiration ofthe December wheat contract.   The rally in wheat prices was moderated by weekend rainsin relatively dry sections of the Southern Plains, where thehard red winter wheat variety is in its dormant stage.   The condition of the crop is especially important thisyear because the U.S. wheat supply is forecast to fall to 414million bushels when it reaches its lowest level of the yearin May. The so-called ending stockpile is expected to beabout half the size of the wheat cushion that was availableon May 31, 1991.   The weakening U.S. dollar is fanning speculation that U.S.soybean exports will continue to improve. Soybean exportssince the beginning of fall are roughly 30% higher than theyear-earlier period, analysts said.   Among other things, U.S. soybean exports are being helpedby a tight supply in South America, which is normally a majorcompetitor of the U.S. in the world soybean market.   In other agricultural markets, prices of cattle futurescontracts rose after falling sharply last week amid signsthat a glut of mature cattle is building on feedlots thismonth. Feedlots fatten cattle for slaughter. The rebound wastriggered by bargain buyers.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Petroleum prices were generally higher in slowpre-Christmas trading. There was little news to account forthe gains, which weren't enough to ease the bearish tone ofworld oil markets. Some traders attributed the rise toshortcovering. Others described it as a technical reaction tolast week's steep drop. There also appeared to be a flurry ofbuying in reaction to charges by Iraq's foreign minister thatthe U.S. is plotting to overthrow Saddam Hussein. On the NewYork Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for February deliveryrose 26 cents to settle at $18.78 a barrel. January heatingoil was up 0.49 cent to 53.32 cents a gallon, while Januarygasoline gained 0.75 cent to 52.99 cents a gallon.                                                                                                          COCOA: Prices ended higher, with the March contract rising$15 a ton to $1,313. There was little news driving themarket, but traders appeared to buy because the current cropyear, which started Oct. 1, seems likely to be the second ina row in which consumption outstrips production, said PhilipGotthelf, editor of Commodity Futures Forecast, a commoditynewsletter. However, he said the current rally is a &quot;bulltrap&quot; because current supplies are more than adequate to meetdemand, especially in light of events taking place in theformer Soviet Union. &quot;I have heard rumors that {the formerSoviet republics} might not buy any cocoa at all this year,viewing it as a luxury that can easily be dropped fromtheir shopping list,&quot; he said. In the 1989-90 crop year,the Soviet Union was the fourth largest grinder of cocoabeans in the world, at 170,000 metric tons. The largest wasGermany at 282,000 tons. Mr. Gotthelf said he wouldn't beinterested in buying cocoa until the situation in the formerSoviet Union has been clarified.                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE: Prices tumbled as warm weather persisted inFlorida. The March contract settled at $1.5820 a pound, off3.80 cents from Friday and down more than 20 cents from itshigh during the fall. Judith Ganes of Merrill Lynch Futuresin New York said traders who were fearful of carrying a shortposition over last weekend came back to the market yesterdaybut saw no evidence of cold weather and either abandonedtheir long positions or aggressively sold contracts short.She said seasonal lows historically are reached in January,so if the mild weather continues, the market will fallfurther. Charles Notis of Freese-Notis Weather in Des Moines,Iowa, said he sees no chance of a freeze in Florida for thenext couple of weeks. He also said long-range studies forthis winter indicate that temperatures will be above normal.There will be some cooling in northern Florida in the nextfew days, Mr. Notis said, but not enough to threaten thecitrus crop. He also said Brazil has been getting rain forthe past couple of weeks in at least some orange-growingregions. Ms. Ganes said those rains might &quot;damp the ardor ofsome of the orange juice bulls.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
