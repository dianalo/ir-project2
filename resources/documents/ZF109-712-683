(Softaid Inc.'s CodeStalker 386) (product announcement)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Strassberg, Dan.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Softaid Inc introduces the CodeStalker 386 in-circuit emulator(ICE) that is priced much lower than other ICEs for Intel's 80386microprocessor.andP;  The $9,995 device includes support for real-timetrace and 33-MHz operation of the target system; it is suitablefor use to build complete systems around the 32-bit 80386,although some features have been scaled back to keep the pricedown.andP;  The CodeStalker 386 downloads code from a hostmicrocomputer at a rate of 250Kbytes per second as a result of itshost-to-emulator fiber-optic link, which lets the host fill thedevice's 448Kbyte emulation memory in under two seconds.andP;  Ohmicisolation in the link precludes noise being injected into the hostor ICE by either the target or the emulator.andP;  The real-time tracecapability in the CodeStalker 386 is adequate but not exceptional;the source-level debugger included is enhanced to work with thefiber-optic link.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Softaid Inc.
