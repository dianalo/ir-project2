As a result, Monfort recalled a termination notice it sent to 800 employees of the pork-packing plant here and rescinded its agreement to lease the plant to a third party.    In July, the company told its employees it made a preliminary agreement to lease the plant to MSP Resources Inc., a move that would have ousted the union. Employees were told they would lose their jobs at the beginning of October but could apply for work with the new company. MSP was to operate the plant for Monfort, and the Lincoln, Neb., company had signed an agreement with the Teamsters.    The leasing arrangement angered the union, which termed the agreement &quot;illegal and immoral.&quot; In addition, the city of Marshalltown and the community college here reacted to the leasing notice by rescinding $2 million in job-training and sewer subsidies they had granted Monfort this year when the company announced it would expand the plant and double its employment.    The union and the company said they also agreed to a &quot;news blackout&quot; during the negotiations. Talks are scheduled to resume Monday. </TEXT></DOC>
