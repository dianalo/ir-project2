(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Presidential candidate Pat Robertsonsaid he made a stop at a Baton Rouge airport Saturday to supportfellow evangelist Jimmy Swaggart because ``in Christianity we don'tshoot our wounded.''   Swaggart, who stepped down from his television pulpit Feb. 21after tearfully admitting to an unspecified sin, reportedly paid aprostitute to pose naked and tried to make a deal with a preacherwho confronted him about it.   Robertson said Swaggart was in seclusion at his walled familycompound _ routinely guarded by security officers _ and the twofelt a personal visit to the home ``would expose him to furtherunneeded scrutiny by the press.''   Robertson's brief airport appearance came while he was en routeto Huntsville, Ala., from Houston.   The Republican candidate said he had talked twice by phone toSwaggart on Saturday. ``I told him I want to see him soon restoredto his pulpit and continue again his magnificent work.''   ``I am not one who is going to get involved between theAssemblies of God, which I admire and appreciate, or JimmySwaggart. That is an inner-church matter,'' Robertson, a SouthernBaptist, said when asked if he was urging the Assemblies of God togo light on any punishment.   Louisiana officials of the Assemblies of God recommended barringSwaggart from preaching for three months, but officials at thegroup's national headquarters sent the recommendation back, askingfor reconsideration.   ``A person is forgiven when he asks for it,'' said Robertson.``In my estimation, God has forgiven him. I just wanted tosymbolically put my arm around him and say, `Brother, I love youand I am here to tell the world.'''   Robertson also made a peace offering to Vice President GeorgeBush, a fellow GOP presidential contender.   ``While we're in an attitude of reconciliation, I think it mightbe appropriate to ask for reconciliation between me and GeorgeBush,'' Robertson said when asked if he felt Bush had anything todo with disclosures about Swaggart. ``I don't wish to have anyconfusion or animosity between us.''   Robertson charged earlier in the week that the disclosures aboutSwaggart and the prostitute were timed to hurt his campaign. Heoffered no proof, and declined to say who he thought was behind thedisclosures. However, in the same interview he accused Bush'scampaign of ``dirty politics'' and ``trickery'' directed at him.   Meanwhile, there was no indication when Assemblies of Godofficials in Louisiana might submit new punishment proposals forSwaggart.   ``I would not have any comment on that. I'm sorry, you know. Ijust don't have any comment,'' the Rev. Cecil Janway, districtsuperintendent of the church's Louisiana District Council, saidSaturday.   Neither the church nor Marvin Gorman, the defrocked Assembliesof God minister who reportedly confronted Swaggart with photographsdocumenting his indiscretions, has said exactly what they were.   But admitted prostitute Debra Murphree claims Swaggart paid herto pose naked and talk dirty to him, but did not have intercourse.   She tried to sell her story to the National Enquirer for$100,000, but the tabloid rejected her offer after she failed a liedetector test, senior editor Paul Levy said Friday. Murphree toldWVUE-TV on Friday that nervousness, drug use and inability toremember some of the questions caused that failure.   Before the pictures were given to church officials, Swaggartoffered to help Gorman return to the Assemblies of God and to haveGorman appear on his television show, according to unidentifiedsources quoted in Saturday's editions of the Times-Picayune in NewOrleans.   Gorman, who claimed in a $90 million lawsuit against Swaggartand 13 others that Swaggart destroyed his ministry by spreadingfalse rumors of numerous adulterous affairs, refused to comment onthe report. So did officials at Jimmy Swaggart Ministries in BatonRouge.   The sources, which the newspaper described as close to Gorman,said Gorman told Swaggart he wasn't especially interested in eitheroffer and gave Swaggart four months to deal with his personalproblems.   ``There were no strings,'' one source told the newspaper.``Swaggart knew that Gorman had photographic proof of hisindiscretion but Gorman was leaving it up to Swaggart to figure outhow to deal with it. Gorman did not dictate how Swaggart shoulddeal with it.''   The newspaper quoted its sources as saying that Swaggartappeared truly repentant, and Gorman left the meeting satisfiedthat Swaggart was ready to seek the counsel of church elders andaccept their advice.   Gorman wrote Swaggart early this month to remind him of thedeadline, the newspaper said, but when there was no response peopleclose to Gorman gave the photographs to national Assemblies of Godleaders in Springfield, Mo.   Those leaders forbade officials and ministers to talk about theproposed punishment, when a decision might be reached, or anythingelse about the matter.   F.C. Chamberlain, a Louisiana presbyter who said Friday that itwas Swaggart's complete confession _ not favoritism _ that prompteda recommendation for an unusually short three-month suspension, hadno comment Saturday.   Calls to other members of the district council either were notanswered or were not returned.   The council recommended Monday that Swaggart undergo two yearsof rehabilitation and counseling, starting with a three-monthsuspension from preaching in this country.   CBS News, without citing any sources, reported that the church'sExecutive Presbytery in Springfield told leaders of the Louisianadistrict to order Swaggart to step down for a year. The church'sgeneral superintendent, G. Raymond Carlson, refused to say whatpenalty was recommended.   Co-pastor Jim Rentz, who has taken the pulpit at Jimmy SwaggartMinistries during Swaggart's preaching tours abroad, was to giveSunday's sermon. There was no advance word on its subject.</TEXT></DOC>
