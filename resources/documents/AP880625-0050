Roger Cooper's appeal came in a 16-page handwritten letterreleased Friday by a parliamentary delegation back from anunofficial mission to Iran.   John Lyttle, spokesman for Archbishop of Canterbury RobertRuncie, said Cooper gave him the letter while he was in Iran. Hepassed it on to the four-member delegation, which returned toBritain on Wednesday.   The letter, dated June 20, said news of the mission ``filled mewith hope,'' and urged Britain to take the initiative to improverelations.   Cooper, 53, has lived in Iran for more than 20 years. He wasarrested in December 1985 and jailed for alleged spying. He isbeing held in Tehran's Evin Prison.   ``Britain is seen as a sly neo-colonialist, `an old fox' muchmore skilled than the Americans or Russians in politics _ andtherefore potentially more dangerous,'' the letter said.   It said Iranians criticized Britain for participation in aU.S.-led economic blockade of Iran and for supplying Iraq withmaterials useful in its nearly 8-year-old war with Iran.   The letter pleaded for increased aid, trade and culturalrelations with Iran.   Runcie, leader of the Church of England, arranged the mission'sthree-day visit to explore ways of bringing about the release ofBritons in Lebanon who are believed held by pro-Iranian ShiiteMoslem extremists.</TEXT></DOC>
