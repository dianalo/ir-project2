Since the 1984 election, political consultants and theorists have argued that the 76 million Americans born in the Baby Boom years were the key to the 1988 election. Victory in next year's election, according to this orthodoxy, could be won by harnessing the energy and support of the Baby Boomers -- reluctant voters, perhaps, but ready to respond to a distant trumpet.    Now that several of the 1988 presidential aspirants have embraced this theory and tailored their campaigns to it -- Democratic Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware used the word &quot;generation&quot; 11 times in a single speech here the other day -- there is growing skepticism of the value of a generational appeal. There are real doubts that the Baby Boomers are much different politically from their parents or their younger brothers and sisters.    &quot;The people who think the 1988 election is going to be a big Beatles reunion are wrong,&quot; says Paul Maslin, a Democratic political consultant who has soured on the generational thesis that is animating a number of presidential campaigns this year. &quot;You can't just punch generational buttons and think you're going to win the election.&quot;    Those born from 1946 to 1964 may have bigger personal debts and more education than others in the country, but they differ little from the rest of the population on many major political questions. Public-opinion polls examining voter attitudes on the government role in improving the living standards of poor and black citizens and on military spending, for example, show virtually no generational patterns.    &quot;A lot of these candidates are appealing to a generation that doesn't exist,&quot; says Warren Miller, a voting-behavior specialist at Arizona State University.    These emerging doubts challenge the prevailing doctrine of the 1988 campaign, a theory that has been promoted by Republican political consultant Lee Atwater, now George Bush's campaign manager, and by Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell: that the party or candidate who mobilized the Baby Boom generation could, in Mr. Caddell's words, &quot;dominate politics for well into the 21st century.&quot;    The result was a new spurt of exhortations evocative of the New Frontier, allusions to the excitement generated by the space race and the Peace Corps, and appeals to the political commitment of the Vietnam and civil rights protesters. The Baby Boom thesis was at the center of the 1984 presidential campaign of Gary Hart and is forming the strategic contours of the 1988 campaign of Sen. Biden, who is being advised by Mr. Caddell.    For four years, as he has prepared for the presidential campaign that he will formally launch next week, Mr. Biden has pitched much of his appeal to Baby Boom voters. The 44-year-old senator, himself just a little senior to the Baby Boomers, spoke in his address here at Harvard University of &quot;the America of my generation&quot; and made a series of references to President Kennedy, whom he called &quot;the president of my youth&quot; and a man who &quot;understood the generational passage of power.&quot;    Democratic Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts and Republican Rep. Jack Kemp of New York also invoke the spirit of the Kennedy era. And shortly after Democratic Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, a Baby Boomer himself at age 39, said he would enter the presidential race, he vowed an &quot;explicit&quot; generational appeal.    Demographers and political scientists agree that the Baby Boom generation has transformed the character of the country, first increasing elementary and secondary school enrollment by 50% between 1950 and 1960, then changing the definition of the American family and still reshaping the economy -- 70% percent of Baby Boom women, for example, are in the work force.    But no longer do these analysts believe that the Baby Boomers will transform politics.    &quot;It's tempting to believe this stuff if you're of the Baby Boom age,&quot; says Morris Fiorina, chairman of the National Election Studies, a nonpartisan, government-funded examination of election trends since 1952. &quot;But this whole theory is a wild exaggeration.&quot;    The National Election Studies data show that the Baby Boomers oppose involvement in Central America by precisely the same rate as the general population. The data show, moreover, they don't differ significantly on questions of governmental aid to minorities, spending for Medicare, spending for Social Security and in party identification. The general population is composed of 10% more Democrats than Republicans -- about the same composition as the Baby Boomers.    &quot;There's no longer anything very distinctive about the population in the Baby Boom bulge,&quot; says Mr. Miller. &quot;There's nothing setting them apart from the rest of the voting population.&quot;    The new questions about the value of transforming the election into a generational crusade also emerge from analyses of poll data showing that Baby Boom voters tend to be motivated more by economic circumstances and education than by their allegiance to their generation. &quot;Generations on the whole are very heterogeneous,&quot; says Nelson Polsby, a political scientist at the University of California at Berkeley, &quot;and other aspects of their identities matter a lot more than age.&quot;    Public-opinion polls show that well-educated Baby Boomers have more in common with their well-educated elders than with others born at the same time that they were. They show that affluent Baby Boomers -- the generational slice of about 5% who became known as yuppies -- have more in common with affluent older voters than with laborers of their own generation.    &quot;The group is too diverse and their formative political experiences aren't the same,&quot; says Thomas Mann, executive director of the American Political Science Association.    Some specialists now are arguing, moreover, that the events that constituted the soundtrack of the Baby Boom generation were an overture to the general population as well. &quot;Sure, they all experienced the civil rights movement and the Vietnam protests and the assassinations,&quot; says Norval Glenn, a University of Texas sociologist who specializes in family and generational issues. &quot;But older people experienced those things, too. They didn't make the Baby Boomers different.&quot;    Perhaps because the Baby Boomers comprise the largest generation in the nation's history, it was inevitable that conventional wisdom would conclude they were very different.    &quot;It may be conventional,&quot; says Mr. Polsby, &quot;but it's not wisdom.&quot;    ---   Voting by Age Group   Percentage of voters in various age groups who supported Republicans in the 1986 congressional elections.
