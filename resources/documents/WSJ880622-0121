At a news conference in Brasilia yesterday, Finance Minister Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega said the tentative settlement, if approved by all banks in the lending syndicate, would be &quot;the best debt accord we have ever had.&quot;    The proposed accord, which has to be approved by hundreds of creditor banks around the world, should lead to the ending of the country's moratorium on an estimated $67 billion of medium-term and long-term foreign bank debt, which was declared by President Jose Sarney on Feb. 19, 1987.    As soon as a communique announcing the prospective debt settlement is issued, Brazil will pay between $300 million and $400 million of bank-debt interest owed from March, according to a senior New York banker and an official in Brazil.    The accord hasn't yet been announced officially because of last-minute disagreements among the 14 banks on the creditor committee about exactly how the $5.2 billion of loans should be divided among lenders, officials in the U.S. and Brazil said. A senior banker close to the talks said banks still had to decide among themselves what precise percentage of their loans to Brazil creditors should use to decide their contributions to the $5.2 billion loan. &quot;They're arguing about half a percentage point. It's a small dispute,&quot; he said, adding that it should be settled soon.    Mr. Nobrega said early this year that he wished to end the bank-debt moratorium. Brazil, the developing world's largest debtor, with $121 billion of foreign obligations, said it had to declare the bankdebt moratorium because of declining foreign-exchange reserves.    The moratorium, and the uncertainty it caused, has undoubtedly hurt both Brazil and its bank creditors. The country found it had to pay more for the trade and short-term credits that it needs to finance its commerce and maintain its financial system. Brazil also had to keep its foreign-currency reserves at the Swiss-based Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers' bank, to preserve them from potential bank litigation. That meant these monies didn't earn the best yields available.    The moratorium also helped undermine two consecutive Brazilian finance ministers, Dilson Funaro and his successor Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira, both of whom failed in bids to defy the international financial establishment and forge new ways of dealing with their country's foreign debt problem. In contrast, Mr. Nobrega, who took over as finance minister at the beginning of this year, reversed his predecessors' policies and has vigorously pursued reconciliation with foreign creditors.    For the banks, the moratorium was crucial in helping to force many big U.S., British and Canadian institutions to add more than $20 billion to their loan-loss reserves last year. It also spurred banks into a string of debt agreements with other developing countries last spring. Bankers were fearful that other heavily indebted countries might copy Brazil's hard line.    Despite its costs to both sides, the moratorium also probably helped foster the recent more flexible approach by creditors to the debt problems of heavily indebted countries. Although it had to drop its opposition to agreeing to an economic program with the International Monetary Fund, Brazil did succeed in securing a more flexible link between a pending program with the IMF and its agreement with its bank creditors.    Under the terms of the proposed accord, as reported previously, $62 billion of bank debt would be rescheduled over 20 years at an interest margin of 0.8125 percentage points over prevailing domestic rates or the London interbank offered rate, the rate banks charge one another for money in the London market. Brazil has been paying an average interest rate margin of 1.7 percentage points over the London rate on its bank debt.    The $5.2 billion of fresh loans would have a 12-year maturity, including a five-year grace period at the start, during which no principal payments would have to be made. There also would be options for debt-equity conversions, and bonds for those creditors who do not want to share in the projected new loan.    The accord also would let Brazil buy back a portion of its debt on the so-called secondary loan market, where developing country credits are swapped and sold. </TEXT></DOC>
