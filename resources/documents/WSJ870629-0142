The centerpiece of the law is &quot;employer sanctions,&quot; a series of written citations, followed by fines and even jail terms for employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants. The law's goal is to curtail illegal immigration by eliminating the magnet of jobs for illegal immigrants, the bulk of whom come from impoverished Latin American and Caribbean nations.    Employers don't face fines or need to keep records on employees, legal or illegal, for workers hired before President Reagan signed the law Nov. 6.    Last week, the Immigration and Naturalization Service formally announced that enforcement measures would be eased in with &quot;informational visits&quot; to encourage voluntary compliance with the law. A second visit, however, could result in a written citation. And after two visits from immigration officials, fines of $250 to $2,000 per illegal immigrant will be levied.    Repeat violations can result in fines of as much as $10,000 an individual. Criminal penalties for repeat offenders consist of a $3,000 fine per individual and/or a six-month jail term.    Additionally, under the new law, employers can face civil fines of $100 to $1,000 for not complying with record-keeping requirements, under which employers must verify the legal status of new employees on a form called an I-9.    It was only this month that the Immigration Service began distributing handbooks explaining the documentation requirements to the nation's seven million or so employers.    Last Friday, a House-Senate conference committee agreed to a measure calling for the Immigration Service to postpone until Sept. 1 the requirement that employers fill out the I-9 form within three days of a new worker's hiring. Immigration officials say they will abide by the congressional directive, except in cases of flagrant disregard of the law. The measure, attached to a spending bill for fiscal 1987, still requires Senate and House approval and President Reagan's signature. </TEXT></DOC>
