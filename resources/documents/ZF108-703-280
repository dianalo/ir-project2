Bureau of the Census.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>No 'Whiz-Bang,' But Systems Work WellandM;Despite loud criticisms of the 1990 census, the chief of the Census Bureau'sDecennial Operations Division says his new computer systems have performedwell.andM;&quot;Anyone will tell you that, [although] what we are using is not all thatwhiz-bang,&quot; said Arnold Jackson, who was hired in 1984 to begin designing thecomputer systems for this year's census.andM;The bureau installed more than $80 million worth of Digital Equipment Corp.andO;minicomputers in 485 field offices, seven processing centers, 12 regionalcenters and Census headquarters in Suitland, Md.andM;This marks the first time the field offices have had any computer equipment.andO;More than 7,000 temporary workers were hired to operate the computers.andM;Each district office has a DEC MicroVAX II and a dozen or more VT320terminals.andP;  Each processing center has a VAX 8810 and two VAX 8530s.andM;The processing center staff transfers the census forms to microfiche andconverts their information to binary data using equipment developed by theCensus Bureau.andP;  The binary data travels over dedicated lines to a UnisysCorp. 1100/94 mainframe in Suitland.andM;&quot;Field automation has allowed us to accelerate collection,&quot; Jackson said.andO;&quot;We get the data in faster and have more time to review and edit it.&quot;andM;Despite all the publicity, Jackson said only 3 percent of census forms weredelivered to the wrong address or not delivered at all.andM;&quot;We did better than in 1980,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Since it's all automated, we've beenable to provide updates to the field offices much faster.andP;  In 1980, thatwould have meant culling through a lot of paper.&quot;andP;  This year, managersreceived a daily report on how many forms had been returned and where theproblems were geographically.andM;By early May, 63 percent of the 106 million households polled in the initialmailing had responded.andP;  In June, workers began calling and knocking on doorsto amend incorrect information, confirm which housing units were unoccupiedand clear up the remaining &quot;non-responsive cases.&quot;andM;Because federal and state governments will distribute billions of dollars tolocal governments based on 1990 census data, the accuracy of the count is ahot issue.andP;  The bureau is finishing up a post-enumeration survey (PES) of150,000 households to determine just how accurate the earlier data is.andM;Several legal challengers are trying to force the Commerce Department to usethe results of the PES to adjust overall results.andP;  In the past, Jackson said,&quot;The PES has been used for evaluation, but it has never been used to changethe census numbers.&quot;andM;A panel will make a recommendation to the secretary of Commerce, who willmake a decision by July 1991 &quot;as to whether we should leave the censusfigures as they are or use the figures that come out of the PES.&quot;andM;For their part, Census Bureau officials believe the 1990 census will prove tobe one of the most accurate yet.andM;&quot;Automation has given us more time to go out and check on differentlocations,&quot; Jackson said.andP;  &quot;We did the same thing [in 1980], but we justdidn't have as much time or resources.&quot;andM;By the end of the year, the bureau must calculate the population counts thatare used to apportion seats in the House of Representatives.andP;  And by April 1,1991, each state is due to receive a detailed population count for politicalredistricting.andM;Once these legislative requirements have been met, the bureau can begindistributing the 1990 data to the public.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
