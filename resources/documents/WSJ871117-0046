At the opening day of hearings before an administrative-law judge, lawyers for the Hunts and other defendants in the Commodity Futures Trading Commission case set forth for the first time their defense against allegations that they conspired to manipulate silver prices in 1979 and 1980.    The commission charges that massive silver purchases by the Hunts and others drove silver prices to a record of more than $50 an ounce on Jan. 17, 1980, leading to a sharp plunge.    One key element in the Hunts' defense, said attorney Paul Curran, will be that economic and geopolitical forces -- such as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, turmoil in Iran, double-digit interest rates and soaring inflation -- were the &quot;real culprits&quot; behind the crash.    The evidence, Mr. Curran told the administrative-law judge, Arthur Shipe, will show that Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt &quot;had no intention whatsoever to manipulate, corner or squeeze the silver market.&quot;    The CFTC's complaint, filed in February 1985, alleged that the Hunts and others, including International Metals Investment Co., a Bermuda-based concern that the commission said was formed by Saudi investors and the Hunts, bought more than 100 million ounces of silver bullion in U.S. and European markets between September 1979 and March 1980. The buying spree caused silver prices to be &quot;artificially high&quot; during this period, the commission maintained.    At yesterday's hearing, Mr. Curran asserted that the Hunts weren't conspirators, but rather were conservative men of great wealth seeking a &quot;haven safe from the corrosive effects of inflation, from the uncertainty of paper assets and the geopolitical frailties of currency and oil-related assets.&quot;    The silver market, however, didn't turn out to be such a haven. The amount of the losses incurred by the Hunts when the silver market collapsed isn't precisely known. But a 1982 Securities and Exchange Commission report shows that after the crash the brothers were left with silver obligations of $1.75 billion and a silver hoard of 59 million ounces valued then at $1.2 billion, indicating a loss of $550 million. The Hunts may have been able to reduce the indicated loss with various income-tax strategies. They retained their hoard by arranging a $1.1 billion loan through Placid Oil Co., one of their family's main holdings.    Mr. Curran depicted his clients as &quot;silver bugs&quot; inclined to invest in so-called hard assets, and as would-be international bullion brokers who wanted to take advantage of the gush of Arab petrodollars at the time. That interest led to the formation of International Metals, a joint venture with two Saudi sheiks, he said.    Mr. Curran and Paul Perito, an attorney for the company, insisted that the company's silver trading was legitimate and independent of the Hunt brothers. Mr. Perito denied that the company acted as an &quot;alter ego&quot; of the Hunts, as the commission has alleged.    At the hearing, Stephen Meyer, an assistant enforcement director at the commission, said the Hunts and other defendants took most of their silver positions before the market perceived their enormous demand for silver bullion and before prices began soaring from the September 1979 level of $11 an ounce. When the price peaked at more than $50, the value of the Hunts' holdings reached $9.5 billion.    A wave of selling, coupled with rule changes by the futures exchanges, resulted in the silver market's collapse, with prices plunging to $11 an ounce by late March 1980. Mr. Meyer told yesterday of overseas silver purchases and other desperate steps by the Hunts to forestall the plunge.    Opening arguments by both sides came after Mr. Shipe denied a motion by the Hunts' attorneys to close the hearings to the public and issue a gag order on participants. Mr. Shipe rejected their argument that publicity from the hearings, which are expected to last five weeks, would harm the Hunts' chances of obtaining an impartial jury and a fair trial in a civil case pending in federal court in Manhattan. In that case, scheduled for trial Feb. 3, Minpeco S.A., a mineral concern owned by the Peruvian government, is trying to recoup $100 million in losses from the silver market's collapse.    Other defendants in the commission's administrative case are Naji Robert Najas, a Brazilian investor; Advicorp Advisory andamp; Financial Corp., a Geneva investment advisory firm; Jean-Jacques Bally and Pierre Alain Hirschy, who were Advicorp officers; ContiCommodity Services Inc., a Chicago commodities trader; and Norton Waltuch, a registered floor broker and ContiCommodity officer.    Each defendant faces civil penalties of as much as $100,000 for each violation of the Commodity Exchange Act or the commission's anti-manipulation rules. Among other possible sanctions, the Hunts and others could be barred from commodity-futures trading, and the registrations of Mr. Waltuch and ContiCommodity could be revoked by the commission. </TEXT></DOC>
