 To be offered OEM, the MicroSystemSeries 4000, 3000 and 1000 are based on 80486, 80386 and 80386SX chipsrespectively.andP;  Each features a high-resolution graphics - 20 megapixels persecond - subsystem, Intel Unix System V.3.2, X Window, Ethernet, TCP/IP andNetwork File System.andP;  The Series 4000 Model 25T uses a 25MHz 80486 delivering12 MIPS.andP;  It comes with 8Mb RAM, from 170Mb to 1.3Gb disk and eight expansionslots.andP;  Also available in a server configuration at $14,600.andP;  The Series3000, claimed to deliver 6 MIPS, is based on a 25MHz 80386.andP;  It has 8Mbmemory, 170Mb to 1.4Gb disk and costs $11,500 in desktop or desksideconfigurations.andP;  The low-end Series 1000 uses a 16MHz 80386SX, is rated at 3MIPS, comes with 4Mb memory and from 70Mb to 340Mb disk.andP;  It costs $6,300.andO;The 80386 model is available now, the 80486 follows in a week or two, and the80386SX model is set for second quarter.andP;  Additionally there are newintelligent add-on boards for Unix-based 80286, 80386 and 80486 systems.andP;  TheiMX-PORT/8 AT card has eight serial ports and costs $800, the iMX-LAN/586Ethernet card costs $900 - both are out in March.andP;  Intel has shied away fromoffering a complete workstation in the past, mainly for fear of upsetting itsmicroprocessor customers, including IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computer.andO;Intel's rationale for this departure seems to be the growing importance ofthe OEM market - it reckons firms are less inclined to buy only at thecomponent level and to do their own manufacturing these days.andP;  MicrogenHoldings Plc has been growing too fast.andP;  Too fast for its management to keepup, anyway.andP;  Too fast to spot that &quot;a deliberate and systematic fraud&quot; mayhave been perpetrated against the company for which a provision of #839,000has been made under extraordinary items.andP;  Explaining why profits for the yearto October are 28% down at #7.2m, the reprographic and laser printingservices company says bluntly &quot;The main cause was that the group, 40 timeslarger than it was 10 years ago, had outgrown its senior managementstructure.&quot; The company says that the problem was particularly acute in theUK service companies, which account for two thirds of group profits.andP;  And inan orgy of mea culpas, the company acknowledges that it should haveanticipated much earlier the need for additional and different managementskills to run the enlarged business effectively and maintain above averagerates of growth.andP;  Reorganisation of the UK companies, start-up costs ofDatagraphix dsitributorships in Scandinavia and losses in direct mail laserprinting also cost about #1.5m.andP;  On the people front, the company brought inJohn Thorpe from running the Security Print division of De La Rue to be groupmanaging director in March; tapped Richard Davies from Rank-Xerox to be UKsales director in November; went back to De La Rue for Gerry Liddle,appointed group financial director this month; and gone to Agfa for ChristophKnig, who is to be Eurocom Depora sales director.andP;  On the operational front,the company is acting in anticipation that the days of microfilm are numbered- no such evidence has yet shown up in the returns from companies in thefield, but clearly optical disks must sweep it away over time - and as wellas diversifying into invoice management and Community Charge services, hasarranged a distributorship for optical disk systems.andP;  On the direct maillaser printing losses, the company says that Imagen, the company it acquiredto enter the business, does not fit it strategy, and will now be sold.andP;  InScandinavia, Microgen reckons that it has built firm foundtions for futuregrowth, although one-time costs meant that profits were flat.andP;  In WestGermany, a price war caused a halving of profits.andP;  On the fraud, which isburied at the bottom of the announcement, in the hope, no doubt that mostpeople won't read that far, Microgen says that circumstances surrounding itare the subject of a criminal investigation by the police.andP;  All in all, thesurprise has to be that the figures were not a whole lot worse, an indicationof how strong the underlying businesses are.andP;  Earlier warnings meant that thebad news was already in the price, and the shares were off only fourpence to121p, at which level they could start to look cheap on a medium term view ifthe new appointments pay off.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
