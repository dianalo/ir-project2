<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-54-0007 </DOCNO><TEXT>Trends for the occurrence of superconductivity and magnetic order in narrow-bandmetals are reviewed. Magnetic interactions and strongly nonadiabaticcoupling between electrons and the lattice are discussed as importantlimitations on the superconducting transition temperature T/sub c/. Thequantitative influence of the temperature and magnetic field dependencesof normal state parameters on the upper critical field of heavy fermionand high-T/sub c/ superconductors, including the novel very-high-T/subc/ copper oxides, are considered. Recent evidence is reviewed for theexistence of an unexpectedly low energy scale T/sub o/ that acts as ahyperstrong cutoff for the T/sub c/ of heavy fermion, A15 and other narrow-bandsuperconductors.</TEXT></DOC>
