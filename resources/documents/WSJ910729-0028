In fact, a lot of small stockslook downright pricey now that the Nasdaq Composite Index hasrisen 31% this year, roughly twice as fast as the big-stockindexes.   Nevertheless, there are still good buys out there,particularly for believers in a long-term small-stock rally,several money managers say.</LP><TEXT>   Small stocks are &quot;not screamingly cheap,&quot; says PaineWebberInc. investment strategist Mary Farrell. After rocketing inthis year's first four months, many smaller issues now arelolling in a tight trading range at valuations close to thoseof larger shares.   In Houston, small-stock devotee Henry Lartigue ispatiently waiting for &quot;the fat pitch&quot; while he hunts forbargains in today's expensive market. Mr. Lartigue, managerof the $150 million Texas Commerce Special Equity Fund ofHouston, now has about 30% of his fund in cash. After paringholdings of highfliers, he's hoping a market slump will pitchhim more of the bargain stocks that helped his fund ride to a37.3% gain through the end of June.   But now the shares of some of his favorite companies arecoasting at nosebleed levels: HealthCare Compare sells atabout 77 times the past 12 months' earnings; 50 Off Storeshas a multiple of 46; Costco Wholesale trades at 43 timestrailing earnings and United Healthcare sells at a multipleof 38.   &quot;The risk-reward looks a little bit out of kilter to haveyour pedal to the metal,&quot; he says.   By one measure -- stock prices compared with earnings --small stocks have soared to become costlier than largershares, according to Wilshire Associates of Santa Monica,Calif. Specifically, 750 large stocks measured by Wilshirenow sell at an average 17.5 times earnings, while the 1,750next largest companies trade at 22 times -- even higher thana year ago before they collapsed after Iraq invaded Kuwait.That decline, many analysts say, marked the end of aseven-year bear market for small stocks.   By another yardstick, however, small stocks may still haveroom to grow. Comparing stock prices to book value --corporate assets minus liabilities -- the smaller 1,750shares tracked by Wilshire Associates trade at 2.75 timesbook value, compared with a price-to-book ratio of 3.58 forthe 750 largest stocks tracked by Wilshire.   This may be heartening to the growing crowd of small-stockfans who say that a long-term rally in the group began inOctober. For the next five years, says Eric Miller, chiefinvestment strategist of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc.,small stocks are expected to outperform Standard andamp; Poor's500-stock index as the climate that favored big companieschanges.   Without the pressure of takeovers, big companies aren'tbuying back shares and taking other defensive actions to keeptheir stock prices up and raiders at bay, he notes. Thestronger dollar doesn't favor big multinational companiesthat heavily depend on foreign operations, but should helpdomestic companies, many of them small. And small companiesmay be more adroit at managing during tough times.   Analysts say they sense a growing drumbeat of interest insmall stocks from big investors, notably pension funds. Mr.Miller further notes that small-stock indexes are becomingmore popular and also are likely to attract buyers, just aslarge-stock indexes did in the 1980s.   On Friday, convinced that small stocks have arrived,Stratford Advisory Group Inc. of Chicago advised clients toshift another 10% of their assets to small stocks from largeones. Stratford, with $10 billion under management, nowsuggests that clients commit 60% of their stock investmentsto large shares and 40% to small -- half in so-called &quot;value&quot;stocks and half in growth stocks.   The landscape for large, economically sensitive shares&quot;remains bumpy&quot; as the economy struggles to recover, assertedDavid Kudish, president of the group. The strong dollar,meanwhile, will undercut the earnings of big multinationalgrowth companies. &quot;We think we have three to five years aheadof us&quot; of small-stock strength, he said.   Among value-oriented investors, Walter Cass of CuratorsCapital Management Inc. in New York looks for companies withstrong cash flow, &quot;superior management,&quot; valuable assets andturnaround potential.   Hadson Energy Resources Corp. of Oklahoma City, NavigatorsGroup Inc. of New York, Jandamp;J Snack Foods Corp. of Pennsauken,N.J., and Fulton Financial Corp. of Lancaster, Pa., are fourof his favorites.   At Friday's close of 12 3/4, Hadson Energy is trading wellbelow an estimated asset value of $20 a share that UBSPhillips andamp; Drew analyst Tim Curro thinks the company isworth. Mr. Cass says he believes Hadson's 49% owner, HadsonCorp., &quot;gave an intentional low-ball bid&quot; when it recentlyproposed a stock-for-stock exchange that would give HadsonCorp. 63% of a new combined company and Hadson Energy 37%.Hadson Energy recently hired a financial adviser, and Mr.Cass expects the company will fetch comfortably more than itscurrent price.   Navigator Group President Terence N. Deeks owns more than34% of the company, which insures marine, aviation and energybusinesses. Mr. Cass, impressed with management, also expectsmarine and aviation insurance rates either to stay steady orrise.   The frozen carbonated beverages sold by Jandamp;J Snack Foodsare catching on fast, says Mr. Cass. By next year, thecompany plans to double to 8,200 its dispensing units; salesshould have a big impact on earnings a year later, as thecompany must fully pay back its installation costs in thefirst year. Meanwhile, the company's pretzel business isbrisk, he says.   Conservatively managed Fulton Financial has fewnonperforming loans, steers clear of farm loans, has asizable trust department and is centered in awell-diversified economy, says Mr. Cass. At Friday's close of17 1/8, the stock sells at about nine times the past 12months' earnings.   Among growth-stock followers, Ms. Farrell of PaineWebberrecommends only those &quot;super growers&quot; among small stocks, orcompanies whose brisk earnings growth can offset the riskthat big institutions might not be able to easily buy or selllarge blocks of their stocks. Among those are microcomputermaker Advanced Logic Research Inc. of Irvine, Calif., andspecialty retailer Charming Shoppes Inc. of Bensalem, Pa.   Meanwhile in Houston, Mr. Lartigue is biding his time ashe waits for the stocks of fast-rising stars such as AmgenInc. and Borland International Inc. to fall 25% or morebefore he steps in for more. He also is waiting to buy theshares of other companies that grow at 20% to 25% a year atabout 15 to 16 times next year's earnings. &quot;I think we'llhave the opportunity this fall,&quot; he adds.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Over-the-counter stocks rose for the second consecutiveday, aided by an 8% jump in Microsoft.   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 2.41 to 492.69, or 0.49%,outpacing the New York Stock Exchange Composite, whichfinished unchanged, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average's0.26% drop. For the week, however, small stocks fell alongwith larger ones. The Nasdaq Composite Index slid 0.98%, theNew York Stock Exchange Composite eased 0.87% and the DowJones industrials lost 1.45%.   OTC volume Friday fell to 124.6 million shares from 134.7million Thursday. Advancing issues outpaced decliners, 982 to303.   Microsoft leaped 5 to 71 after analysts at both GoldmanSachs and Dean Witter Reynolds repeated &quot;buy&quot; opinions on thesoftware maker. Both analysts left a meeting with the companyenthusiastic about its prospects.   Amgen rose 3 to 140 3/4 after its drug Neupogen, whichstimulates the production of infection-fighting white bloodcells, was approved by regulatory authorities for sale inGermany. The product will be marketed there by affiliates ofAmgen and Roche Holding, a co-developer.   Immunex, however, shed 2 1/4 to 45 3/8, although thebiotechnology concern reported better-than-expectedsecond-quarter earnings of three cents a share, compared witha loss of 48 cents a year earlier. Traders attributed theweakness to comments by Oppenheimer andamp; Co. analyst JeffreyCasdin, Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said. Althoughthe analyst believes Immunex's new product pipeline haspotential, he said, &quot;success is far out on the horizon, witha lot of hurdles to get over.&quot;   T2 Medical sank 2 to 55 1/2 on what analysts said weremisplaced fears that the company's operations will be hurt bynew Department of Health and Human Services rules onphysician referrals. The new regulations will limit doctors'ability to send their Medicare and Medicaid patients to carefacilities in which the physician has an ownership position.But Peter Costa, an analyst at Tucker Anthony Inc., said T2'sfacilities don't rely heavily on Medicare patients, Dow JonesProfessional Investor Report said.   Utilx plunged 4 3/8 to 9 1/2. The company, which installsunderground cables and pipes, said it's unlikely thatsecond-quarter results will match the level posted a yearearlier. Meanwhile, it reported earnings of 17 cents a sharefor its first quarter, ended June 30, up from 15 cents a yearago.   Applied Biosystems lost 2 to 11 1/2. Even though it postednet income of five cents a share in the fiscal fourthquarter, ended June 30, compared with a loss of five cents ayear earlier, the company projected a small loss for thefirst quarter. The maker of automated instruments andbiochemicals cited the uncertain economic climate and thecontinued strength of the U.S. dollar in foreign-exchangetranslations.   North Carolina Natural Gas slid 1 to 23 after its mergeragreement with Sonat Inc. was terminated. The companies wereunable to resolve problems over environmental troubles atsites owned by North Carolina Natural. Last month, Sonatindicated that the transaction might not be completed.   Oshkosh B'Gosh Class A stock slumped 3 1/2 to 35 3/4 afterthe clothing manufacturer posted second-quarter net of 31cents a share, down from 34 cents last year. Sales, though,rose to $71.4 million from $66.4 million a year earlier.   Country Lake Foods leapt 3 to 14 after Land O'Lakesoffered to acquire the 32% of the company that it doesn'talready own. Country Lake said its board appointed a specialcommittee to evaluate the $13.50-a-share offer.</TEXT></DOC>
