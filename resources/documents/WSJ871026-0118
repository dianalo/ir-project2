Edelman said a group he leads owns 11.5% of Foster Wheeler Corp. and is seeking a meeting with management to &quot;discuss a possible sale of the company.&quot;    Mr. Edelman said Friday that he had contacted Louis Azzato, president of the Livingston, N.J.-based engineering and construction concern, to arrange a meeting, but that Mr. Azzato rebuffed him, saying it was the intention of management and the board that Foster Wheeler &quot;remain independent.&quot;    When asked whether the Foster Wheeler response would deter his group's possible offer, Mr. Edelman said, &quot;Has it ever before?&quot;    Mr. Edelman said the group will file a statement today with the Securities and Exchange Commission, disclosing the contact with Foster Wheeler, as well as the intentions of the Edelman group.    Mr. Azzato and other Foster Wheeler officials couldn't be reached for comment.    As previously reported, the Edelman group said last month it may seek control of Foster Wheeler when it disclosed it held a 3.7% stake. Foster Wheeler's board subsequently voted to distribute to shareholders some rights commonly used as an antitakeover step.    Mr. Edelman said his group purchased the 11.5% stake for an average of about $18 a share. Foster Wheeler shares closed Friday at $17, up $1.125, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    Foster Wheeler has about 34.5 million shares outstanding.    ---   Telex Can't Reply on Offer   TULSA, Okla. -- Telex Corp. said its board was unable to take a position on the $65-a-share tender offer for the company by Asher Edelman, the New York investor.    The maker of computer terminals and telecommunications equipment said it couldn't make a recommendation to shareholders on the offer because of the &quot;unsettled state of the stock markets generally and the recent volatility&quot; in the company's common stock price.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Telex closed at $50.75 a share, up $3.625.    Mr. Edelman's TLX Acquisition Corp. owns 1.1 million Telex shares, or 7.7% on a fully diluted basis. It would pay about $895 million for the remaining shares. The tender offer began Oct. 9 and expires Nov. 6. Mr. Edelman said Friday that he had &quot;no present intentions of changing&quot; his bid for Telex.    Telex said Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. was unable to give the company an opinion on whether the offer is adequate. As previously reported, the company has asked management and Drexel to investigate alternatives to &quot;maximize value&quot; for stockholders, including seeking another buyer, recapitalizing or pursuing a management-led leveraged buy-out. Telex said it is holding discussions with other possible buyers for the company.    In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company.    Telex also said it will sue the Edelman group and others for alleged violations of securities law in connection with his bid. </TEXT></DOC>
