Deere didn't disclose details of the new contract. The contract covers about 1,000 members of the International Association of Machinists, which isn't participating in the 114-day strike by the United Auto Workers. The UAW and the big farm equipment maker are divided over job security and pension issues.    Deere blamed the strike and the depressed farm economy for the $139.7 million loss it reported last week for the fourth quarter ended Oct. 31 and its prediction of a fiscal 1987 first-quarter loss. </TEXT></DOC>
