In two hours of testimony, former Prime Minister ZenkoSuzuki denied reports that he accepted money from Kyowa andthat the now-bankrupt steel-frame maker was a heavycontributor to his faction within the ruling LiberalDemocratic Party. The faction, one of several that jockeysfor power within the LDP, now is led by Prime MinisterMiyazawa.</LP><TEXT>   In separate testimony, Jun Shiozaki, a former cabinetminister and a member of Mr. Miyazawa's faction, acknowledgedaccepting a 20 million yen ($155,000) payment from Kyowa forusing personal connections to smooth relations between Kyowaand Marubeni Corp., a major trading house.   Testimony by the two senior politicians should end atwo-week boycott by opposition parties of budgetdeliberations in the Diet. The Kyowa scandal has beenespecially embarrassing to Mr. Miyazawa, because it hasfocused on members of his faction. Along with other scandalsand stalled legislation, it has raised doubts about Mr.Miyazawa's grip on power.   To blunt criticism, Mr. Miyazawa spent the past weekendhammering out a modest set of political-reform measures, onwhich the prime minister has been accused of dragging hisfeet. Since the Recruit Co. stock-for-favors scandal of thelate 1980s, the LDP has failed to deliver on promises toclean up the political system.   The 81-year-old Mr. Suzuki, prime minister from 1980 to1982, had resisted appearing before the Diet and soughtinstead to be questioned at home. He relented afteropposition parties agreed that he didn't have to be sworn in,a procedure that could expose the witness to perjury charges.   Mr. Suzuki denied reports that he accepted 10 million yenfrom Kyowa. But he said he was entrusted with 10 million yenby Fumio Abe, a Miyazawa-faction member who has been chargedwith accepting 90 million yen in bribes from Kyowa. Mr.Suzuki said Mr. Abe presented him with 10 million yen soonafter Mr. Abe was given his first cabinet post in 1989, as agesture of gratitude for Mr. Suzuki's support. But Mr. Suzukisaid he didn't use the cash and later returned it.   Earlier in the day, opposition politicians grilled Mr.Shiozaki, a former Finance Ministry tax official, on hisfailure to report the payment for two years, until Kyowa'sproblems surfaced. Mr. Shiozaki, who was a sworn witness,said he had delayed reporting the money because he couldn'tdecide whether to treat it as a political donation or astaxable income, an explanation that drew sneers from theopposition.</TEXT></DOC>
