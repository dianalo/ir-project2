PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge has ruled that MonsantoCo. also could be held liable for damages from the Copper-7intrauterine device that is produced by its subsidiary G.D. Searleandamp; Co.   The ruling Monday by U.S. District Judge Robert Rennerrepresents a second legal setback for Monsanto involving theCopper-7 device, which was taken off the market in 1986, a yearafter Monsanto acquired Searle.   Last week Searle was ordered by a jury to pay $8.75 million inpunitive and compensatory damages to Esther Kociemba, an Elk River,Minn., woman who said the IUD caused her to become sterile.   In the latest case, Renner ruled that Julie Daher, of ColumbiaHeights, Minn., could sue both Searle and Monsanto for damages froma Copper-7 she used between October 1984 and October 1987.   Monsanto, based in St. Louis, Mo., had been named asco-defendant in about two dozen Copper-7 cases, but all of thosecases had been dismissed in court or dropped by the plaintiffsuntil Monday's decision.   Monsanto stock plunged after the ruling Monday, falling $7.12{to $78.62{ in active trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Inearly trading today it was off another $1.50 to $77.12{.   Daher's attorneys claim Monsanto acted in concert with Searle inmisrepresenting the safety of the Copper-7 and fraudulentlyconcealing dangers associated with the device after it acquiredSearle in October 1985 for $2.8 billion.   Legal experts have said Friday's jury verdict could result inthousands of lawsuits against Searle.   Monsanto maintains ``there simply is no justification for thejury's action.''</TEXT></DOC>
