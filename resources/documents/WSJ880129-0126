(&quot;We were looking for a picture of George Bush kissing King Fahd, but couldn't find it,&quot; adds Mr. Buckley.)    Cut to Sen. Bob Dole. &quot;And Bob Dole supports a tax increase on imported oil.&quot; Cut to a New Englander stoking a wood stove. &quot;And you'll pay the bill. Only Jack Kemp opposes higher oil prices.&quot;    Mr. Buckley is right that the ad has driven both the Dole and Bush camps to distraction, but, more interesting, it illustrates one of the curiosities of this campaign season: the influence of the 30-second TV spot. Vice President Bush may have produced the best &quot;attack video&quot; of all time with his nine-minute spat with Dan Rather, but some of the other candidates are doing just fine in 30 seconds. Mr. Kemp's spot on oil prices, along with one each on taxes and Social Security, have coincided with a big leap in his poll ranking in New Hampshire. Meanwhile, Richard Gephardt has used a series of red-hot populist spots on trade and economics this month to help climb to the top of the Democratic rankings in Iowa.    Thirty-second ads are only one part of any campaign, of course, especially when organization and free media coverage count for as much as they do in Iowa and New Hampshire. But TV spots at least have the virtue of political distillation; a candidate can explain his message free of outside interference. A couple of hours spent watching the TV spots of most of the presidential candidates gives a pretty good insight into what kind of campaigns they're running. Some, like Mr. Dole and to some extent Democrat Michael Dukakis, are all image and experience, ignoring the issues. Others, like Mr. Kemp and Pete du Pont, stress issues and go on the attack.    Mr. Kemp's case is the most interesting, partly because he has tried it both ways. Earlier &quot;soft&quot; spots that stressed his character and broad optimism didn't seem to take him very far; pundits began writing off his chances. So in December, the campaign turned to the sharp comparative ads that, says Mr. Buckley, &quot;tried to draw distinctions&quot; between Mr. Kemp and the two GOP front-runners. Messrs. Dole and Bush have voted to raise taxes and cut Social Security; Mr. Kemp never did and won't in the future. &quot;They're clearly working,&quot; claims Mr. Buckley, citing the latest polls.    Both the Dole and Bush camps dispute that, but they're obviously concerned. Mr. Dole has been denouncing Mr. Kemp at every stop for distorting his record, while Mr. Bush seems to have already filmed his own 30-second ad in response. &quot;I'm told some people are out there telling you that I'm interested in raising taxes. They've got it wrong,&quot; says Mr. Bush, in an ad that just began running in New Hampshire. &quot;By the way,&quot; he says in the ad, &quot;I'm totally opposed to an oil import fee, too.&quot;    Mr. Dole's ads, on the other hand, don't talk about much of anything except himself. They stress his experience, show him working in his shirtsleeves at his office and walking with farmers, and inevitably mention that Bob Dole is &quot;one of us.&quot; &quot;What's the difference&quot; between Bob Dole and the other candidates? asks another spot. Answer: &quot;Only one grew up in Depression-era Kansas,&quot; fought to &quot;save&quot; Social Security and the family farm, and cut government spending.    Among the Democrats, Mr. Gephardt has decided to play to Iowans who are economic nationalists, not to say xenophobes. One ad berates the Koreans for putting taxes and tariffs on a Chrysler K car that raise its price to $48,000 in Korea. Under his trade amendment, the ad says, the Koreans are going to have to remove those barriers during six months of negotiation, or else &quot;they'll . . . be left asking themselves: How many Americans are going to pay $48,000 for one of their Hyundais?&quot;    Domestically, too, he's stressing a farm-belt populism that echoes back to the early 20th century. &quot;. . . There's someone else we need to get tough with -- corporate America,&quot; says another spot. &quot;It's time to stop exporting American jobs and start exporting more American products.&quot;    Aides to the other Democrats admit a grudging respect for the Gephardt ads, but doubt they would resonate so well outside of Iowa or among other than union Democrats. &quot;I don't think Mr. Gephardt can ride a $48,000 Hyundai to the White House,&quot; says David Axelrod, media consultant to Sen. Paul Simon.    Indeed, most of the other Democratic contenders stress character more than issues. Sen. Simon takes a bow to a government that is activist and caring again, but his latest spot, called &quot;Bow Ties,&quot; stresses the personal fortitude demonstrated by his choice of neckwear. Gov. Dukakis's ads first stressed the Massachusetts economic &quot;miracle,&quot; but, says an aide, two of his most recent ads are designed to counter the perception that he's just a &quot;cool technocrat.&quot; They deplore the homeless (shown in front of Cartier and the White House) and &quot;the fiasco in Central America&quot; (thugs in dark sunglasses contrasted with crying mothers and caskets).    Further back in the polls, Gov. Bruce Babbitt has begun to run a spot, called &quot;Imagine,&quot; that predicts a surprise victory for him in Iowa. Campaign aide John Russonello explains that the voters already know where he stands on the issues, in particular that he wants to raise taxes. The ad begins, &quot;The candidate they said was too honest to win . . .&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
