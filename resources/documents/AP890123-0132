And although what ``pro-choice'' forces term a woman's right tocontrol her body may not be in jeopardy, ``pro-life'' forces arehoping the court will significantly dent what they call abortion ondemand.   Removed from, but not unaware of, the political battle beingwaged outside its stately edifice, the court is studying a Missourilaw that makes abortions more difficult to obtain in that state.   Lower courts invalidated the law, and state officials want itreinstated. If the law runs afoul of the court's landmark Roe vs.Wade decision legalizing abortion, says the Missouri appeal understudy, it's the 1973 ruling that should give way.   Arguments in the case will be heard sometime in the spring, and adecision is expected by July.   Over the years _ most recently in 1983 and in 1986 _ the courthas resisted state attempts to add muscle to theirabortion-regulating powers. Some of the invalidated measures aresimilar to those proposed in Missouri.   But the court's membership has changed since its last majorruling on abortion rights, adding new drama _ and the potential fora differing result _ to the Missouri case.   Many constitutional law experts predict the current court willnot retreat from its 1973 finding that women have a fundamentalconstitutional right, based on privacy, to end their pregnancies.   But those experts say the justices may be willing to alter the1973 guidelines dictating how state and local governments mayinterfere with that right. At stake is the scope of availability oflegal abortions, which now number about 1.5 million a year.   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Byron R. Whitedissented from the Roe vs. Wade ruling and several subsequentabortion decisions.   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has questioned the reasoning of the1973 ruling.   Justice Antonin Scalia, who has not yet voted in an abortiondecision since being named to the court by then-President Reagan in1986, is thought to favor overturning or curtailing Roe vs. Wade.   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, another Reagan appointee who joinedthe court last February, likewise has not participated in anabortion case. His views on Roe vs. Wade are not known.   Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshalland John Paul Stevens are seen as staunch supporters of the 1973decision and the trimester-by-trimester approach it took in limitinggovernmental regulation of abortion.   The decision said a woman's decision to have an abortion duringthe first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and herdoctor.   It said states may interfere in the abortion decision during thesecond trimester only to protect the woman's health, and may takesteps only to protect fetal life in the third trimester. Stateauthority to regulate abortions after the first trimester was notmade absolute, however.   The justices knew the trimester approach they adopted was in manyrespects arbitrary, according to internal court memoranda unearthedand published this week by The Washington Post.   Blackmun, author of the 1973 decision, told a law school audiencelast September that Roe vs. Wade could be overturned this year.   ``There's a very distinct possibility that it will _ this term.You can count the votes,'' he said.   For Blackmun, the continuing controversy generated by the 1973decision has become a personal, emotional matter. His statementtherefore may be discounted as something less than an actualprediction.   But the court's decision in the Missouri case, whether or not itdisturbs Roe vs. Wade, is destined to become, at least temporarily,the new watershed in what likely is a never-ending debate overabortion.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Richard Carelli has covered the Supreme Court forThe Associated Press since 1976.</TEXT></DOC>
