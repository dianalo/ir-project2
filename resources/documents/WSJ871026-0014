The regional Bell holding company said it hasn't chosen a specific site. U S West added, however, that it will build the facility near the University of Colorado in Boulder and Colorado State University in Fort Collins if it can work out the details. The two universities are about 30 miles apart.    U S West eventually may employ as many as 1,500 people at the facility, the value of which could reach as much as $50 million, depending on the outcome of actions pending before federal Judge Harold Greene. Judge Greene oversees compliance with the terms of the Bell system breakup, in which U S West and six other so-called Baby Bells were created. American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. has asked the court to prohibit the Baby Bells from certain research.    The center was the focus of controversy in the 14-state region that U S West serves. Some phone industry regulators accused the company of trying to force their support of sweeping deregulation by threatening to rule out their states as potential sites. The company denied acting improperly.    In selecting Colorado, Jack MacAllister, chairman and chief executive officer, said: &quot;We operate in 14 great states. Each has its strength. All were given serious consideration.&quot; He said U S West chose Colorado largely because of compatibility between work by its Advanced Technologies unit and research at the two Colorado universities. </TEXT></DOC>
