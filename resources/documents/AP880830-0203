According to the Worldwatch Institute, about 4.3 bushels ofwheat are required to buy a barrel of oil, a little more than halfof the grain that was needed just three years ago.   But over the long haul, says institute president Lester R.Brown, the odds ``seem certain to favor the oil exporters'' becausethey are dealing in a non-renewable commodity, compared with wheat,which can be planted every year.   ``Another surge in oil prices is likely sometime during theearly '90s,'' Brown said. ``When it comes, it will throw the termsof trade decidedly in favor of oil exporters.''   In his view, countries that sell grain and import oil should beinvesting in automobile fuel efficiency and seeking alternatives tothe car and petroleum-based fuel.   ``For the United States, basic policy measures such as theimposition of a gasoline tax and the extension of autofuel-efficiency standards will help minimize the effect of the nextmajor shift in the wheat-oil exchange rate,'' Brown said.   Worldwatch Institute, which is based in Washington, is aprivate, non-profit research organization which studies globalproblems, often focusing on agriculture and the food supply.Brown's comments about wheat and oil were in the current issue ofWorld Watch magazine.   ``The economic fortunes of nations rise and fall with shifts inthe exchange rate between two widely traded commodities, grain andoil,'' Brown said.   Grain directly supplies half of the calories the world's peopleconsume, and indirectly supplies part of the remainder in the formof grain-fed meat, milk and eggs. Oil accounts for more than 40percent of commercial energy use.   Exports of these dominant commodities are concentrated in ahandful of countries, with grain coming mostly from North Americaand oil from the Middle East.   ``The United States, which dominates grain exports even morethan Saudi Arabia does oil, is both the world's leading grainexporter and oil importer,'' Brown said. ``And, ironically, all 13members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)are grain importers.''   Several trends have converged to boost grain prices, he said.Millions of acres of U.S. farmland have been abandoned or retiredunder federal programs to protect highly erodible soil. Worldwide,the area planted in grain is shrinking at a time when food demandsare rising.   Drought also has been a factor across much of the United Statesthis year, and in 1987 in the Indian subcontinent. Grain priceshave risen sharply.   ``Oil prices, meanwhile, have remained stable, despite OPECattempts to raise them by urging non-member oil exporting countriesto also curb production,'' Brown said. ``As a result the wheat-oilexchange rate has been falling somewhat during 1988.''   In the near term, he said, the advantage to grain exporters isproviding ``a modest redress for the losses they suffered in thevolatile oil market of the '70s.''   Brown said the 1970s ``upset the remarkably stable rate ofexchange'' that had existed between grain and oil during the thirdquarter of the 20th century.   ``In economic terms, anyone with a bushel of wheat during thattime could exchange it for a barrel of oil in the world market,''he said.   In 1950, Brown said, wheat was $1.91 a bushel and oil at $1.71 abarrel, meaning that a bushel of wheat could be traded for 1.1barrels of oil. In 1972, just a year before the first oil pricehike, a bushel of wheat and a barrel of oil were both worth exactly$1.91.   According to Brown's report, the world price of wheat in 1975averaged $4.06 per bushel and oil $10.72 per barrel, meaning thatit took 2.6 bushels of wheat to buy a barrel of oil.   ``By 1979, the year of the second oil price hike, the strengthof oil had pushed the exchange rate to roughtly 7-to-1,'' Brownsaid. ``This steep rise in grain-purchasing power oil led to one ofthe greatest international transfers of wealth ever recorded.''   Brown added: ``The coffers of major oil exporters such as SaudiArabia began to overflow with dollars as those of manyoil-importing countries were being emptied.''   By 1985, oil had edged to more than $30 a barrel. With the worldprice of wheat at $3.70 per bushel, it took 8.1 bushels to buy abarrel of oil.   ``In 15 years, the terms of trade for oil-exporting countriesthat import wheat had improved eightfold,'' Brown said. ``Forcountries that export grain to pay for oil, it was an impoverishing15 years.''   Oil prices dropped by more than half from 1985 to 1986 to $14.60per barrel, reducing the exchange rate to 6-to-1 in 1987, evenduring a time of weakening grain prices.   This year, he said, the world price of wheat may average about$3.85 per bushel and oil around $16.50 per barrel, or 4.3 bushelsof wheat to equal a barrel of oil.   ``During the early '70s, U.S. grain exports easily paid thenation's oil import bill,'' Brown said. ``But the United States'failure to wean itself from heavy dependence on this increasinglycostly commodity contributed to soaring outlays for imports, awidening trade deficit, and mounting external debt.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Sept. 4</NOTE></DOC>
