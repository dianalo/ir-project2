(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A business professor who thoughtconstantly of returning to his home here while held hostage inBeirut for 20 months settled into a friend's house Monday whileneighbors prepared his residence for him.   Mithileshwar Singh, who was freed more than three months ago, andhis wife, Lala Mani, returned Sunday night. He said he has no firmplans for his future, but may write a book about his experiences.   ``Grand Junction is a great place to sit down, collect yourthoughts and meet some old friends,'' said Singh, 61. ``It will taketime. I had close to two years in captivity and you take time tobounce back.''   Singh, a citizen of India who has been a resident alien in theUnited States for more than a decade, said he would like to remainin western Colorado.   ``When I was in captivity, I thought all the time of cominghome,'' Singh said after his arrival at Walker Field. ``GrandJunction is my hometown, I consider, and Colorado is my home state.''   Singh spent six years teaching at a now-defunct business collegein Grand Junction before taking a job at the American University ofBeirut.   He was kidnapped on Jan. 24, 1987, and released by the IslamicJihad Oct. 3. His return to Grand Junction was delayed because Singhrequired extensive medical treatment in New York City for diabetesand other health problems, which were aggravated during hiscaptivity, said John Curtis, with whom the Singhs are staying untiltheir house is ready.   Singh told reporters at the airport Sunday that he expectsPresident-elect George Bush ``will be more willing to negotiate''for the freedom of remaining American hostages.   ``I believe (Secretary of State-designate James) Baker and Bushwill be more flexible on hostage releases,'' Singh said. ``I thinkthey will be more willing to negotiate and discuss the issues,because some kind of dialogue should be initiated by ourgovernment.''   Singh also predicted developments in the status of remainingAmerican hostages this week, as Bush is sworn in.   ``I do feel that something should happen by the date ofinauguration,'' Singh said. ``I do not really know, it is my faith.''   On President Reagan's Inauguration Day in 1981, the Iraniansreleased the American Embassy hostages they had held for 444 days,almost at the same time Reagan took his oath.   Singh's neighbors have spent hours cleaning the interior and yardof his small ranch-style house. No set time has been set for Singhto move in.   Yellow ribbons hang on neighborhood trees, and local Realtorsdonated money for carpet cleaning and painting.   The Singhs were moved by the turnout of about 20 friends at theairport, some with ``Welcome Home'' signs and many with tears intheir eyes.   ``This is a great emotional experience,'' Singh said. ``When itcomes to coming back home, it feels different. This journey to GrandJunction is like that.''</TEXT></DOC>
