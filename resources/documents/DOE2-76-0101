The ability to readily manipulateand express cloned DNA can provide a relatively rapid method to explorestructure-function relationships for a particular protein. The recentcloning of one of the regulatory subunits of the cAMP-dependent proteinkinase will certainly provide new information concerning the enzyme.It seems likely that in the near future recombinant DNA techniques willhelp provide substantial new information concerning the structure, function,and regulation of protein kinase subunits. The usual starting point forapplication of recombinant DNA techniques to study of a particular proteininvolves the isolation of a cloned cDNA containing coding sequences forthat protein. The authors describe the methods they have utilized toisolate a cDNA for a protein closely related to the catalytic subunitof cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The same general technique could beused to isolate a cloned cDNA for any protein kinase or in fact for anyprotein for which a portion of the amino acid sequence was known.</TEXT></DOC>
