Recognizing the financial strains of long-term disability,more employers are letting employees donate leave time tounfortunate co-workers who exhaust their paid time off; someconcerns even let workers deposit time in leave banks. NowIRS Revenue Ruling 90-29 spells out the tax effects of atypical company plan to aid workers who face a substantialloss of income during prolonged medical emergencies affectingthemselves or members of their families.</LP><TEXT>   Under the plan, a worker who exhausts paid leave appliesin writing for leave surrendered by co-workers or drawn fromthe bank and is paid at his normal rate. That added leave payis taxable compensation for the worker's services, the IRSsays, and is subject to tax withholding, the Social Securitytax and the unemployment tax.   Workers who give up leave don't realize income -- nor dothey incur deductible expenses or losses, even when someoneelse uses their leave, the IRS says.                                                                                                          DON'T HANG UP cellular-phone deductions withrecord-keeping, lawyers urge.   As more and more motorists whizzed by with phones glued totheir ears, the 1989 tax act tightened restrictions onbusiness deductions for cellular phones bought after 1989.Now users must have records separating business calls frompersonal ones. If business use isn't substantiated,employer-supplied phones turn into taxable income foremployees. Does this call for hanging a logbook from therear-view mirror or for combing through monthly bills toidentify deductible conversations? It surely does.   But two Washington lawyers, Mary B. Hevener and AnnetteGuarisco, are asking the IRS for relief from record-keeping;they suggest a rule like an existing one foremployer-provided cars: If an employer's policy forbade allbut very limited personal use of its cellular phones,employees wouldn't have to keep records. Tax officialsindicate informally that such a rule seems reasonable, Ms.Hevener says.                                                                                                          THE IRS BLOCKS a corporate maneuver to use up tax-losscarry-forwards.   The 1987 tax act aimed to stop companies with big unusedcarry-forwards from buying other companies and selling theirassets to take advantage of built-in value gains that wouldoffset the carry-forwards. The act provides that thosepre-acquisition losses may not offset built-in gainsrecognized in the first five years after acquisition.Naturally, companies soon saw that they could get around thisby selling assets for installment notes due after the fiveyears -- when the gain would be recognized.   Now, notes Robert Willens of Shearson Lehman Hutton, theIRS has used its rule-writing authority to squelch suchinstallment plans. Notice 90-27 warns that the IRS will issueregulations providing that for an installment sale occurringwithin the first five years, the disqualifying period will beextended to include the final installment payment's due date.   This broadening of the 1987 law to preclude theinstallment-sale maneuver took effect March 26.                                                                                                          THE PERSONAL EXEMPTION rises in 1990 to $2,050, adjustedfor inflation, from $2,000 in 1989; indexing rules roundedthe increase down to the nearest $50. So a bill by Rep.Hastert (R., Ill.) would round off the adjustment to thenearest $10 -- lifting the 1990 exemption to $2,090.                                                                                                          A MORMON COUPLE'S deduction of gifts to support twomissionary sons was denied by the IRS as a personal expenseand is being reviewed by the Supreme Court. Sen. Symms (R.,Idaho) has entered a bill to treat gifts to missionaries asdeductible charitable donations to a church.                                                                                                          RETURN CHECK-OFFS designating $1 of tax for thepresidential-election fund have been lagging, the FederalElection Commission warns. Now three Democratic senators haveproposed a bill that would raise the check-off amount to $3and require the commission and the IRS to publicize it.                                                                                                          MAIL-ORDER RETAILERS lean on computers to cope with 50,000sales taxes.   More states are requiring out-of-state retailers tocollect state and city sales taxes for them. But how canmail-order companies keep up with rates and requirements of50,000 jurisdictions? Leased computer software is easing thecompliance burden. Vertex, a Berwyn, Pa., software producer,says revenue from its system rose over 50% last year becausemore retailers &quot;find it cheaper to comply than to fight&quot;states' demands. Vertex charges $12,000 for the first yearand under $10,000 a year thereafter.   AVP Systems of Marblehead, Mass., finds orders forcompliance software growing as states intensify theirvigilance and more retailers agree to collect and remittaxes. AVP says new contracts for its system, which may beleased for about $7,000 a year, also increased more than 50%in 1989. Users of compliance software get monthly updates ofsales-tax changes.   In the last six months, New York says, 179 out-of-statecompanies have registered to collect its taxes.                                                                                                          BRIEFS: Tomorrow, the House Ways and Means OversightSubcommittee is to begin a series of hearings on narrowingthe gap between taxes due and taxes paid.
