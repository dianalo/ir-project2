(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Black cats, ladders and cracked mirrorsmove over. The Friday-the-13th superstition of the 1980s iscomputer viruses, say some computer experts.   Computer viruses are devious programs created by computerwhizzes that ``infect'' the computer's hardware and reproducethemselves onto other software. Once confined to flashing aharmless message on private terminals, they have been known toerase sensitive files.   Yet some programmers say they don't believe in computer viruses.   ``I'm not that superstitious and I really don't see any problems_ knock on wood,'' said Jim Gogan, research and developmentdirector at the Microcomputing Support Center for the University ofNorth Carolina at Chapel Hill. ``We are about as secure as thingscan get.''   ``Viruses are like the bogyman,'' said Byron C. Howes, acomputer systems manager at the UNC Educational Computing Service.   He compared programmers who believe in them to ``people who setlittle bowls of milk outside our doors to feed the dwarfs.''   According to published reports, viruses have infected computersat the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, IBM, the U.S.House of Representatives, universities and computer networks inbusinesses overseas.   Last year, hundreds of computers in Israel were hit with a``time bomb'' virus designed to activate today. The virus, whichwas detected and believed to have been wiped out, would have spreadand destroyed all data in any computer it had infected.   ``I just think that the whole thing is a joke,'' said Barry B.Cooper, owner of Commercial Software in Raleigh.   Virus rumors, he said, were like the prediction by medieval seerNostradamus of a major earthquake on May 8, 1988.   ``That didn't come true, and this won't come true,'' he said.   He and others said they were unconcerned because they inspectnew software before using it. Some programmers have ``vaccine''programs that alert them to someone trying to break into the systemor other tampering, Cooper said.</TEXT></DOC>
