The latest quarter also includes a $1.6 million loss from discontinued operations. In the year-earlier quarter, when it was known as Diamond Shamrock Corp., the company had net income of $34.5 million, or 25 cents a share, including earnings from discontinued operations of $55.8 million and a loss from continuing operations of $21.3 million.    Revenue for the latest quarter rose 5%, to $163.5 million from $155.3 million last year.    The company said the write-down, while larger than analysts had expected, allows it to continue the operations while carrying them at values it feels comfortable with.    Maxus said the Alaskan coal effort, which hopes to market coal to the Pacific Rim, hasn't yet won any contracts yet. It said the write-down of the geothermal business, an alternative energy project in Northern California, reflects lower expectations of prices and steam production rates. Previously, Maxus had indicated it might sell the geothermal business.    Maxus blamed its $25.4 million loss before the write-down on lower natural gas prices and a 32% decline in world-wide oil production. Cash flow from continuing operations for the six months was $131.5 million, about the same as last year, and a level that analysts said is considered healthy.    For the six months, Maxus had a net loss of $455 million, including the $380 million write-down and a $52.7 million loss from discontinued operations. In the year-earlier period, it had net income of $24.5 million, or 13 cents a share, after profit from discontinued operations of $39.9 million. Revenue for the period declined 3%, to $315.5 million from $325.1 million. </TEXT></DOC>
