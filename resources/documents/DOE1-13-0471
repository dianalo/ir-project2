Optical systemsare capable of connecting points between planes in any 3 dimensionalconfiguration by using, for example, Fourier transform holography, globalfibers, or even simple lenses, depending on the interconnect complexitydesired. The ability for an optical system to interconnect in three dimensions,is, in the opinion of the authors, the absolute greatest asset of anoptical computer. The original paper continues to describe a digitaloptical full adder enhanced by the full global broadcast capability ofoptics. Finally, a 2 x 2 bit systolic multiplier is described for matrixprocessing. The second paper follows the original by describing a 3 x3 bit systolic multiplier array based on combinatorial logic such thatthe outputs of each multiplication region is a full 6 bit binary weightedanswer.</TEXT></DOC>
