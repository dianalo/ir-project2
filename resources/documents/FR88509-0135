The vast majority of olderAmericans are active members of society_working, creating, volunteering,or simply enjoying the fruits of long years of service to others. As parentsand grandparents, they extend their contributions through formation ofcoming generations of our citizens_their children and grandchildren. Thecommerce of love between generations_fulfillment of a duty and recognitionof a debt_is a ballast that steadies our national enterprise on its voyagefrom past to future.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Not every older American leads an ideal life, however. Regrettably,some suffer from abuse and neglect, wounds all the more grievous for everythingthese citizens have done to build and strengthen this land of liberty.For these men and women, years that should be full of satisfaction andappreciation become instead manacles of torment and disrespect from whichthey cannot escape.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Abuse can take many forms_physical, mental, or emotional. It can comefrom family members, friends, or professionals; it can even be self-inflicted.Neglect is also a form of abuse, a manifestation of carelessness that canbe seen even in situations where an elderly person's basic needs for foodand shelter are being met. Loneliness, of course, is its most obvious sign,and fortunately the most easily cured by others.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Abuse and neglect reach their ultimate expression, of course, in occasionalcases of_and even organized calls for_euthanasia of the elderly infirm.Older Americans have one their duty. In their twilight years, especially,it is our duty to them that matters. No elderly person should live in fearthat he or she is a burden to others or that his or her life will be cutshort for reasons of utility or convenience. We can never have too manyreminders that the gift of life in ours to cherish and preserve from maliceand harm until natural death.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Across our country, State and Area Agencies on Aging, social service,and law enforcement agencies are supporting programs to deal effectivelywith the difficult problems posed by abuse of the elderly. I urge everyconcerned American to help ensure that local programs are available toeducate people about these problems and to assist both the older personand the abuser to get the help they need.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 222, has designated the weekof May 1 through May 7, 1988, as ``National Older Americans Abuse PreventionWeek'' and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamationin observance of the week.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States ofAmerica, do hereby proclaim the week of May 1, 1988, through May 7, 1988,as National Older Americans Abuse Prevention Week.

They defend our Nation, enforcethe laws, help protect the environment, maintain vital transportation systems,work to prevent the entry and abuse of illegal drugs, administer the SocialSecurity system, conduct health research, help parents teach their children,and perform countless other vital tasks for society. These public servantshave also helped develop innovative technologies to show the way in thecritical fields of defense, health care, agriculture, and industry. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In recognition of the indispensable contributions made by governmentemployees, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resoultion 242, has designatedthe period commencing May 2, 1988, and ending May, 1988, as ``Public ServiceRecognition Week'' and has authorized and requested the President to issuea proclamation calling for observance of this week.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States ofAmerica, do hereby proclaim the week of may 2, 1988, through May 8, 1988,as Public Service Recognition Week.

The key ingredientin every act of trade is freedom. Only freedom respects the inherent rights,dignity, conscience, and worth of individuals; only freedom encouragesindividuals to develop their creative abilities to the fullest and to commandfair return for their labor; and only freedom provides a rational and humanebasis for economic decision-making. The freedom of exchange that is atthe heart of every genuine economic transaction benefits all parties andbuilds competition, enterprise, prosperity, justice, cooperation, and socialwell-being as people achieve economic success by finding their fellowman'sunmet needs and filling them well.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Our country's prosperity likewise depends on our ability to identifyneeds and markets for ogods and services and to meet them well. Our freemarket economy, our belief in free but fair trade on a global basis, andthe American people's ingenuity and ability all make our products amongthe world's most competitive_and we intend to keep it that way.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">My Administration has worked to improve the climate for internationaltrade by seeking a renaissance in American competitiveness. Last year,as American goods regained price competitiveness overseas, exports hita record level; more than 407,000 manufacturing jobs were created; andemployment surged, with more Americans in the labor force than ever before.Exports spell opportunity for American business; thousands of U.S. firmshave increased their profit margins by exporting, and thousands are beginningto discover their untapped potential to succeed in export markets. Thisyear's World Trade Week theme, ``Export Now,'' champions the message thatI have joined the Secretary of Commerce in sending and exemplifies America'swinning spirit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Foreign markets are now more open to American goods than in the past,but we have far to go in the quest to undo unfair restrictions on trade.We seek to encourage removal of foreign barriers to free trade, but wesimultaneously work to discourage domestic protectionism_more accuratelydescribed as ``destructionism,'' because it stifles progress and prosperityby preventing competition and economic transactions that people everywheredesire and need. We also reiterate the intention of the United States Governmentto ensure that our trade policies serve to reinforce our national securityinterests around the world. International trade policies and practicesmust promote the causes of freedom, human rights, and economic growth everywhere.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">World Trade Week is a truly appropriate time to remember the manybenefits international trade has conferred on our country and to reflecton the many blessings the spread of economic freedom has brought, and canbring, to people in every nation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States ofAmerica, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution andlaws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 22,1988, as World Trade Week. I invite the people of the United States tojoin in appropriate observances to reaffirm the great promise of internationaltrade for creating jobs and stimulating economic activity in our countryand for generating prosperity everywhere freedom reigns.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day ofMay, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-eight, and ofthe Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twelfth.<ITAG tagnum="65">andPres;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">[FR Doc. 88-10425</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Filed 5-6-88; 12:07 pm]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="50">Billing Code 3195-01-M<FTAG tagnum="4705"/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="44">World Trade Week, 1988</ITAG><FTAG tagnum="4705"/></ITAG><T4>Federal Register </T4> / Vol. 53, No. 89 / Monday, May 9, 1988 / PresidentialDocuments<ITAG tagnum="4">Federal Register </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Vol. 53, No. 89 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Monday, May 9, 1988 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3"> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Title 3_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="7">The President </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">Proclamation 5811 of May 5, 1988 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="41">National Defense Transportation Day and National </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="41">Transportation Week, 1988 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">By the President of the United States of America </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="43">A Proclamation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Transportation is essential to American life. Our safe, fast, economical,and convenient movement of people and goods is the cornerstone of our country'ssocial and economic welfare and of our national defense. Now, as in thepast, our transportation systems_highways, airports, inland waterways,railroads and public transit, our merchant fleet and the Great Lakes andSt. Lawrence Seaway_provide a superior emergency response network and areavailable as a critical component of our national defense. As our citizenstravel in record numbers for business or pleasure, our local, State, andFederal governments continue to work with the transportation industry toenhance transportation safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The growth of our Nation and the development of transportation havebeen intertwined throughout our history. Those who first explored thisvast country were followed by pioneers who established settlements. Mostof the road routes, river systems, and ocean ports used by our earliestsettlers are still in use today. Many of our great cities originated astowns that were starting or end points for transportation systems. As tradeand commerce grew, transportation provided the necessary link to vitalresources that in turn enabled further national growth. On land and water,in the air, and in space, our transportation systems have become an essentialelement of our Nation's economic health, providing indispensable servicesand generating employment for millions of people.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This week we acknowledge the contributions of the dedicated peoplewho build, maintain, and safeguard our transportation systems_from theflagman on a highway project to the space engineer. We honor those wholed the way in the development and improvement of ships, waterways, motorvehicles, highways, trains, airplanes, and our newest transportation vehicles,spacecraft. The recent announcement of our National Space Policy meansthat we continue to call for the help of modern-day pioneers on the frontiersof space technology. With public and private cooperation, our Nation isbuilding a highway to space that will serve as an economic bridge to the21st century.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In recognition of the importance of transportation and of the millionsof Americans who serve and supply our transportation needs, the Congresshas requested, by joint resolution approved May 16, 1957 (36 U.S.C. 160),that the third Friday in May of each year be designated as ``National DefenseTransportation Day''; and by joint resolution approved May 14, 1962 (36U.S.C. 166), that the week in which that Friday falls be proclaimed ``NationalTransportation Week.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States ofAmerica, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 20, 1988, as National Defense TransportationDay and the week of May 15 through May 21, 1988, as National TransportationWeek.
