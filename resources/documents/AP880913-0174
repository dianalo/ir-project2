Rudolf Cordes, who was kidnapped in Beirut 20 months ago, wasreleased by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem captors late Monday night.   The kidnappers seized Cordes and another German, Alfred Schmidt,in January 1987 to try to win freedom for a Lebanese Shiite,Mohammed Ali Hamdi, now on trial in Frankfurt for the 1985 TWAhijacking and the shooting death of a U.S. Navy diver. Schmidt, anengineer, was freed Sept. 7, 1987.   Just before freeing Cordes, the kidnappers said they would nowtry unspecified legal means to win Hamadi's release, but if thatdidn't work ``then we shall be obliged to again resort toviolence.''   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said Tuesdaythat no ransom was paid for Cordes, and no deal was struck. WestGerman officials have also denied that any ransom was paid forSchmidt's release.   Genscher said that he had known since Aug. 24 that after monthsof diplomatic efforts, Cordes would be freed on Monday.   ``It was one of the best-kept secrets in Bonn,'' he said in aninterview with the Deutschlandfunk radio station.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl joined other West Germans in rejoicingover the release of Cordes. Kohl also praised Syria and Iran forhelping to get him free. ``The Federal Government is extremelyhappy over the release of Rudolf Cordes,'' Kohl told a Cabinetmeeting.   Kohl said good relations between Iran and Syria were keyelements in West Germany's success in winning Cordes' freedom.``Intense contacts with Iran and Syria were a central point in ourefforts (to gain Cordes' release),'' he said.   Genscher met several times with Iranian officials over recentmonths urging Iran to exert its influence over Cordes' kidnappersto gain his freedom.   West German officials had also been in contact with Syria, whichhas thousands of troops in Lebanon and has been pressuring ShiiteMoslem militants there to release Western hostages.   Both Genscher and Kohl pledged West Germany's help in trying toget other foreign hostages in Lebanon released.   Seventeen other foreigners, including nine Americans, are stillmissing in Lebanon and it is believed most are held by pro-IranianShiite kidnappers. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondentfor The Associated Press, is the longest held. Anderson, 40, waskidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.   Residents of Cordes' hometown, the Frankfurt suburb ofFischbach, were jubilant that he was finally coming home.   ``And now I have only one wish,'' said Mayor Winfried Stephan.``I hope that Mr. Cordes has been able to withstand the trials ofhis captivity. That is the hope of everyone here who knows him andhis family.''</TEXT></DOC>
