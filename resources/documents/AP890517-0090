Giuliani, who gained fame with hishigh-profile prosecutions as U.S. attorney in Manhattan, announcedhis candidacy for mayor today, promising to fight crime and restorehonest government.   Giuliani, a Republican, told several hundred cheering supportersthat he was running in the spirit of Fiorello LaGuardia, aRepublican who won the mayoralty in 1933 in a city dominated, thenas now, by Democrats.   ``He led a fusion movement, a movement forged by people of everypolitical stripe, to kick out an old, tired and corruptadministration,'' Giuliani said. He spoke at the MetropolitanRepublican Club in Manhattan, where LaGuardia announced hiscandidacy.   Giuliani suggested that his election in itself would promotehonesty in government, declaring, ``A multiparty system is the mosteffective check and balance on corruption in government.''   ``Corruption in New York must be confronted and confronteddirectly,'' he said. ``I am seeking support on one basis and onebasis alone _ that you agree with me that honest, decent, effectivegovernment must be restored.''   The city's last Republican mayor was John V. Lindsay, elected in1965.   Giuliani has made national headlines prosecuting mobsters, WallStreet cheats and corrupt politicians.   In the Republican primary Giuliani faces cosmetics heir RonaldLauder, who is running as a conservative more in tune with thecity's GOP stalwarts.   Democratic Mayor Edward I. Koch, a 12-year incumbent, suffersfrom lagging popularity and trails in the polls to a fellowDemocrat, Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins.</TEXT></DOC>
