After being told that no such category existed, she called directory assistance to ask what headings would be appropriate. &quot;The person we spoke to suggested a listing under 'Escort Services' or 'Night Clubs.'&quot;    Later, a sales representative for the Nynex Yellow Pages recommended a listing under &quot;Human Services Organizations&quot; or &quot;Social Service Organizations,&quot; where other groups serving the gay community are listed.    Unsatisfied with such general categories, Heritage of Pride asked Nynex for a new heading for gay and lesbian organizations. When the request was denied, the group and two homosexual-rights organizations filed a complaint with the New York City Human Rights Commission. The complaint charges Nynex with violating the city's human-rights ordinance, which, among other things, prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.    The complainants estimate that a category for homosexual groups in Manhattan would include more than 100 listings.    In response, Nynex says in a prepared statement that it doesn't discriminate on the basis of &quot;religious or sexual orientation, race, color or creed,&quot; and that any group can advertise in the Yellow Pages, provided its name isn't profane. &quot;Headings identify types of businesses and services provided, not the audience to whom the advertising is directed,&quot; the company says.    The city's Human Rights Commission is expected to rule next month on whether the Yellow Pages are a &quot;public accommodation,&quot; in which case they would fall under the anti-discrimination laws. The panel then would have to determine whether the groups had been discriminated against.    Regardless of the ruling, Nynex says it will add cross references for gay and lesbian organizations in the index of next year's Manhattan Yellow Pages; the index will tell readers to look for such groups under more general headings.    &quot;That's like letting someone into the lobby, but not into the theater to see the movie,&quot; says Paula Ettelbrick, legal director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, one of the groups filing the complaint. &quot;We argue that the Yellow Pages are a public accommodation. This case is one about meaningful access to accommodations.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
