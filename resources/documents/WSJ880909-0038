Stocks were locked in a tight trading range throughout the session, with blue-chip issues lagging slightly behind the broader market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which rose 0.53 point Wednesday, fell 2.67 to 2063.12.    While traders said there was some concern about the news of insider trading charges against Drexel Burnham Lambert and the coming report on August producer prices, they noted that those worries didn't have very much impact on the market.    Among broader market averages, Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.01 to 265.88 and the New York Stock Exchange composite index went up 0.08 to 150.46. There were 765 issues advancing in price on the Big Board and about 677 declining.    Although trading on the New York Stock Exchange rose to 149.4 million shares from 139.6 million Wednesday, the increased volume resulted largely from trading designed to capture dividends of high-yielding stocks. The two most active Big Board issues, Pacific Gas andamp; Electric and Chemical Banking, both carry hefty dividend yields and go ex-dividend Friday.    Even the dividend-related trading was comparatively subdued as Japanese life insurance companies -- the most common users of the tactic in the past -- have curtailed their activity recently. On June 8, the day before Pacific Gas andamp; Electric last went ex-dividend, 97.9 million shares of the stock changed hands; today's Big Board composite trading in the stock amounted to just 11 million shares.    Traders said the imminent release of the producer price data provided other participants with a reason to stay away from the market. The consensus estimate of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report calls for Friday's report to show that prices rose 0.5% last month, equaling July's increase.    Peter J. DaPuzzo, director of retail equity block trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said many investors have unusually high cash positions in their portfolios and aren't in any hurry to invest those funds.    &quot;Investors are willing to spend a little bit of their money, but not very much. No one's getting aggressive on the buy side,&quot; he said. &quot;It's either a waiting game, an 'I don't care' game, or people are putting their money to work in spots.&quot;    Monte Gordon, director of research at Dreyfus Corp., said recent data indicating that economic growth is moderating hasn't been enough to dispel concerns about the possibility of accelerating inflation and higher interest rates. The result, he said, is that the market is likely to have further difficulty in making any progress from current levels.    &quot;It's stuck, and the thing that will break it out of its quagmire is cumulative evidence that the economy is indeed slowing down,&quot; he said. &quot;Until you get that, the market will not be able to mount a significant rally.&quot;    Mr. Gordon also said the market could be hurt by selling pressure &quot;from people who have not fully thrown in the towel yet,&quot; although he added that the economic data should act to reduce the risk of any sharp declines.    Joseph H. Barthel, director of technical strategy at Butcher andamp; Singer, Philadelphia, agreed that the economic worries need to be resolved before the market can find a sense of direction. &quot;As a result, cash will hold it up and uncertainty will hold it down,&quot; he said.    While noting that stocks appear to have room to move higher from a technical standpoint, Mr. Barthel said the advance so far doesn't appear to be much different from the market's upturn earlier this summer, which ran out of steam after about six weeks. &quot;This is going to be business as usual,&quot; he said.    Interco dropped 1 3/4 to 70 as the insider trading charges against Drexel created doubts about whether a group led by the Rales brothers of Washington, D.C., would be able to obtain financing for its $70-a-share tender offer. The company noted that the group, which has been working with Drexel, hasn't yet disclosed whether it has secured the funds and therefore can't purchase any shares under the offer before its scheduled expiration Monday.    The uncertainty arising from the charges also appeared to have some impact on Pennwalt, which fell 1 3/8 to 85. Centaur Partners, an investor group, owns 7.6% of the company's common shares and has expressed interest in making an acquisition offer.    Damon, which has rejected a $24-ashare offer from Nomad Partners, slumped 1 to 23. After the close, the partnership said Banque Paribas is &quot;highly confident&quot; that it can arrange bank financing for the offer.    Meanwhile, Ramada surged 2 1/8 to 9 3/4 in Big Board composite trading of 3.8 million shares on the news of a $10-a-share offer by the Pritzker family of Chicago, which already owns a 7.2% stake. Separately, Ramada said it terminated discussions with BAA of Britain about the formation of a joint venture that would have taken over its international division and its Ramada Renaissance hotels in the U.S.    Irving Bank climbed 1 1/2 to 68 5/8. The company, targeted in a hostile bid by Bank of New York, said it provided third parties with confidential financial information as part of an effort to seek &quot;the best financial transaction possible.&quot; Bank of New York extended its offer for Irving to Sept. 30 following clearance of the extension by the Federal Reserve Board.    Plantronics rose 1 5/8 to 26 1/2 amid speculation that the company may become the target of a $34-a-share offer from Northern Telecom. Such a bid would exceed the $25-a-share offer from a management group that the company has accepted. Northern Telecom denied having any interest in a takeover of Plantronics.    Michigan Energy Resources, which said it is studying offers for all or part of the company, jumped 1 7/8 to 34. The company added that it expects to receive further proposals.    Union gained 2 to 11 1/8. The company said it is selling its Gichner Systems unit in order to concentrate on expanding its financial-services business and has retained Allen andamp; Co. to find a buyer.    The American Stock Exchange index rose 0.64 to 297.00. Amex volume totaled 9,870,000 shares, up from 8,420,000 Wednesday. There were 281 issues advancing, 252 declining and 311 unchanged.    Clark Consolidated Industries surged 3 1/8 to 16 7/8. The company said late yesterday that it has received a $17-a-share takeover offer from a management-led investor group.    Amdahl rose 5/8 to 19 1/8. The computer maker said it expects a pilot program to be in place within the next three to six months for Fujitsu to distribute its mainframe computers in Japan.    Lillian Vernon slid 3/8 to 10 1/8. The company is now projecting a loss for its second quarter ended Aug. 26, although it had previously expected to break even. It cited a slow start-up at its new national distribution center in Virginia Beach, Va., as the cause of the expected loss. </TEXT></DOC>
