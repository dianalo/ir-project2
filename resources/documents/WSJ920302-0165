Stressing issues ranging from school prayer to child care,the president told a riverfront rally here that &quot;America isfirst as long as we put the family first.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The president's immediate aim, two days before the hotlycontested Georgia primary, was to blunt Mr. Buchanan'scharges that he has waffled on proposed federal tax breaksfor families and subsidized pornography through the NationalEndowment for the Arts. Eyeing the general election, he hopesto reinforce the &quot;traditional values&quot; advantage that GOPcandidates have enjoyed over Democrats for a generation.   But the incumbent's pro-family rhetoric faces a formidableobstacle: his record. Statistics indicate that the well-beingof American families has declined on his watch. After growingfor most of Ronald Reagan's presidency, median family incomeshrunk during the first two years of the Bush administration.   The proportion of families headed by a single parent,continuing a long-term rise, has reached one in four. Homeownership among two-parent and mother-child families is down,while the proportion of adult children living with theirparents is up. And Americans are increasingly &quot;stressed outand heavily taxed by the joint demands of work and familylife,&quot; according to a new study by Harvard and Case Westernresearchers.   To be sure, families are buffeted by long-run trends thatwould adversely affect any president. Yet even some of Mr.Bush's allies say his efforts to ease family pressures havefallen short. Republican Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana says theadministration has &quot;a ways to go&quot; in translating its concerninto action.   Liberals such as Rep. Patricia Schroeder of Coloradocomplain that Mr. Bush vetoed family-leave legislation.Conservatives such as Gary Bauer, who heads the FamilyResearch Council, say Mr. Bush hasn't taken bold enoughstands in the &quot;cultural civil war&quot; against unwholesome TVprogramming and other threats to children. David Blankenhorn,who runs the New York-based Institute for American Values,asserts that Mr. Bush lacks &quot;a coherent policy agenda topromote family well-being,&quot; saying he could start bypromoting laws that make divorce tougher to obtain.   On one policy step that nearly all sides favor --increasing families' take-home pay -- Mr. Bush's centerpieceproposal is a $500 per-child increase in the personal incometax exemption that isn't even part of the economic &quot;actionplan&quot; he has demanded Congress pass by March 20. &quot;It's aninsult to families,&quot; complains Robert Rector of theconservative Heritage Foundation, which has proposed a largertax break. And Mr. Bush's proposed exemption increase woulddo nothing for families too poor to pay income taxes.   When Mr. Bush speaks of family troubles, he taps a deepvein of public discontent. &quot;This election is about the stressthat middle-class families are now experiencing,&quot; saysWilliam Galston, a University of Maryland politicalscientist. Bush campaign chairman Robert Teeter adds thatAmericans increasingly fear &quot;the social fabric is comingapart.&quot; More than just financial strains, the pressuresextend from lack of so-called quality time to worries aboutdrugs, violent crime and moral decay.   Ever since social upheaval split the Democratic party inthe 1960s, the GOP has cast itself as a defender of familyvalues against Democrats who would undermine them bysupporting such causes as gay rights and abortion rights. Mr.Bush's own handsome family and Barbara Bush's popularity lendcredibility to his rhetoric, providing positive images thatmay offset negative social trends. On any issue, GOP pollsterRichard Wirthlin has observed, &quot;it's the emotion that drives{voter} behavior.&quot;   Not all the emotions are kinder and gentler. When Mr. Bushattacked the &quot;dismal welfare system&quot; as anti-family in hisState of the Union address, critics saw an attempt to exploitracial divisions. At a time when the president espouses taxbreaks for middle-class families with kids, his calls for&quot;personal responsibility&quot; among welfare clients &quot;begins tosmack of the Willie Horton overtones,&quot; says Isabel Sawhill ofthe Urban Institute.   The president's sudden attention to welfare is especiallystriking, charges Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D., N.Y.), since theadministration hasn't offered &quot;a legislative proposal of anykind&quot; during Mr. Bush's term. Meanwhile, the bipartisan 1988welfare overhaul signed into law by President Reagan -- whichincluded measures to encourage family stability and providejob training -- isn't being fully implemented because manyrecession-squeezed state governments are broke.   Bush-Quayle campaign spokeswoman Torie Clarke maintainsthat the president has done more to strengthen families &quot;thanwe've seen in decades.&quot; In 1990, Mr. Bush signed a five-year,$18 billion increase in the Earned Income Tax Credit forworking families with children, and funding increases haveboosted enrollment by 73% in Head Start for poor children.Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman AlixeGlen dismissed as &quot;absurd&quot; the charge that Mr. Bush isplaying racial politics with welfare.   Mr. Bush's saving grace could be the weakness of theopposition. The three leading Democratic candidates are allvulnerable to GOP broadsides on values: Arkansas Gov. BillClinton has struggled with allegations of infidelity,Nebraska Sen. Robert Kerrey is divorced and single, andformer Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas has actively promotedgay rights.   The recession creates &quot;a much tougher environment to makethat {family-values} message sell,&quot; says Republican pollsterVince Breglio. &quot;The question is, who is the opponent?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
