Facing stiff competition from Europe and Japan in a marketthat is increasingly under pressure to reduce health-carespending, GE is focusing on cost-cutting for the first time,not only on the technical advances that made it the dominantplayer in the diagnostic equipment market for a decade.</LP><TEXT>   For patients, the changing market means lower diagnosticfees, but it may also mean that some major advances willreach the market more slowly. The average cost to patientsfor &quot;magnetic resonance imaging,&quot; or MRI, the most advanceddiagnostic technology widely available, is about $850. &quot;I cansee that coming down to $500 within two to three years,&quot; saysGregory Freiherr, a medical consultant in Silver Spring, Md.   GE, which invented the modern X-ray tube in 1913, has longgarnered the lion's share of the U.S. diagnostic equipmentsales and service market, a $4.2 billion a year field thatincludes MRI and Computed Tomography, or CT, scanners.   In recent years, however, Siemens AG of Germany and theNetherlands' N.V. Philips have increased their U.S. presence.Philips, for instance, began manufacturing CT scanners lastyear in a joint venture with a unit of Japan's Hitachi Ltd.in Concord, Mass. But what has shaken up the field even moreis Toshiba Corp.'s purchase last year of the MRI business ofDiasonics Inc. of San Francisco.   &quot;If there's a new aggressor in the market, it's Toshiba,&quot;says Bobby Bowen, vice president of advanced technology at GEMedical.   Toshiba's U.S. medical systems revenue has grown about 50%annually for the past three years and accounts for 8% of theMRI and CT market in the U.S. GE Medical's share is estimatedat 44%. Siemens and Philips together have about 29%.   GE and Philips concede that in the technologicalcompetition, they lost sight of cost and customer needs.   MRI uses powerful magnetic fields to &quot;see&quot; inside thehuman body positioned in the magnetic field. The complexcomponents of the MRI machine -- magnets to excite thehydrogen nuclei in the body, coils to send radio frequency,and software that turns data into images -- provided a richfield for both significant and marginal technicalimprovements. In the early 1980s, more than a dozenmanufacturers offered MRI machines with a multitude ofimaging capabilities, scanning speeds, and other features.&quot;The whole industry had a tinker toy syndrome,&quot; says MikeMoakley, president of Philips Medical Systems of NorthAmerica.   The same has been true for CT scanning, in which acomputer uses data from multiple X-ray measurements toreconstruct images. Since CT was introduced in the early1970s, so many technologies have been added that customersaren't sure the benefits are worth the costs. In 1987, forinstance, GE introduced a crystal X-ray &quot;detector,&quot; replacingthe xenon gas still used in Siemens and Philips detectors.   But GE's new crystal adds about $150,000 to a CT scanner'scost. Both technologies &quot;are good and they don't make anickel's worth of difference to me,&quot; says James Hoffman,directory of neurology at Emory University Medical School.The same goes for MRI; no machine seems to enjoy a cleartechnological edge, he says. &quot;The real issue is what does itcost, and there isn't any difference there either.&quot;   Competition has cut the price of MRI machines to about$1.8 million, down about 5% annually over the past two years,and discounts off the list price are common. Phil Drew, amedical equipment consultant in Concord, Mass., expectsprices to slip below $1.4 million by the end of next year asToshiba gears up U.S. production and sales.   CT scanner prices have dropped, too, from a milliondollars in the early 1980s, when the Japanese introducedlow-cost machines, to about $700,000 currently. Philips, inthe joint venture with Hitachi, is building CT machines inwhich a microcomputer has replaced the minicomputer,eliminating the need for an air-conditioning device and othercomponents, thereby reducing the scanner's size.   For the past two years, GE Medical has been farming outmanufacture of printed wiring board, harness, and certainmechanical parts, reducing its cost for those components byabout 25%. Last year, it restructured engineering andmarketing operations to simplify and speed production and tofree sales people to concentrate on customers. &quot;We're tryingto be more attuned to what's going on in the marketplace. Wehaven't always done that,&quot; says John Trani, head of GEMedical.   Last November, the company introduced an artificialintelligence program, called InSite, to troubleshootcustomers' CT and MRI machines by telephone from a centrallocation. &quot;GE has come up with a technology that serves as amarketing tool: It can provide instantaneous service thatgives the customer a warm and fuzzy feeling about GE. No oneelse has it,&quot; says Mr. Freiherr, the consultant.   Other companies are linking with Japanese diagnosticimaging equipment makers, whose manufacturing costs areestimated at 20% below GE's. Aside from the Hitachi/Philipslink, GE Medical has a joint venture with Yokogawa MedicalSystems Ltd. that began making a mid-level MRI system inJapan in 1987. Siemens established a tie with Asahi ChemicalIndustry Co. a year ago.   These ventures have marketing as well as manufacturingaims. The Japanese, constrained by limited hospital space andmedical reimbursement plans, had concentrated on &quot;low tomid-field&quot; MRI machines, whose magnetic field strengths areless than 0.5 tesla, or about 10,000 times the strength ofthe Earth's magnetic field.   Major U.S. makers, on the other hand, had been making onlythe high-field MRI machines, with field strength at betweenone and 1.5 tesla, exceeding power requirements for manydiagnostic procedures.   &quot;About 20% of the MRI applications are for orthopedic --for knees, wrists and ankles. We feel the mid-field machinedoes the job adequately,&quot; says Philips's Mr. Moakley, whoexpects that segment to &quot;double in two years.&quot; The smallermachines are easier to install and take up less space, makingthem attractive to the smaller hospitals. But with all thebig manufacturers entering the same market niche at once, itpromises to be quite competitive.   There are legislative pressures, too. Several billsrecently introduced in Congress to bring down health-carecosts specifically target MRI fees.   Manufacturers respond that they don't set the fees, butacknowledge that the current climate isn't propitious forcostly new technologies. GE, for instance, is &quot;pacing&quot; itsdevelopment of an emerging technology known as &quot;positronemission tomography,&quot; or PET, which producesthree-dimensional images that reflect the metabolic andchemical activity of tissue. The technology is in clinicaltrial, but the company isn't making the kind of investment itdid to rush CT and MRI to market.   &quot;The marketplace is affecting the pace of ourtechnologies,&quot; says GE Medical's Mr. Bowen. &quot;The governmentis very cautious about approving reimbursement for PET. Inthe past, if a technology improved patient care, it would beapproved. Now it must also be cost-effective.&quot;   ---             Challenges From Europe and Japan                                                                                                          Market share for CT scanners and MRI machines, based onsales revenue                                                                                                                                                 1986         1990                                                                                                          General Electric                        47%          44%                                                                                                          Siemens                                 14%          22%                                                                                                          Picker International                    15%          11%                                                                                                          Toshiba                                  5%           8%                                                                                                          Philips                                  4%           7%                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Others                                  10%           5%</TEXT></DOC>
