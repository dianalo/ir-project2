North is a hero andhe does not believe any of the Iran-Contra criminal defendantscommitted a crime.   Fielding questions after making a speech to young peoplerepresenting the Center for the Study of the Presidency, Reagansaid he thought that North, along with former national securityadviser John M. Poindexter and other defendants, will be acquittedof charges brought against them in a federal grand jury indictment.   Reagan said he could not understand why the arms-to-Iraninitiative had become his administration's worst political scandal.   ``I still think Ollie North is a hero,'' Reagan said when askedif he was considering a pardon for his former aide, who retiredlast week from the U.S. Marine Corps.   Earlier this week, North and Poindexter, along with arms dealersRichard Secord and Albert Hakim, pleaded innocent to federalconspiracy and theft charges in connection with the Iran-Contraaffair.   Former national security adviser Robert C. McFarlane had earlierpleaded guilty to reduced charges stemming from the arms-to-Irandeal.   After telling his audience that the subject of pardons is``something I can't discuss now,'' Reagan added:   ``I just have to believe that they're going to be found innocentbecause I don't believe they're guilty of law-breaking of anykind.''   Reagan has said on past occasions that he did not believe anylaws were broken in the affair, which came to public light in earlyNovember 1986.   On Nov. 25, 1986, Reagan appeared in the White House press roomto announce that North had been fired and that Poindexter hadresigned.   Attorney General Edwin Meese III came onto the podium a fewmoments later to announce that the administration had uncoveredinformation indicating that proceeds from the arms sales to Tehranhad been diverted to the Iran-Contra rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
