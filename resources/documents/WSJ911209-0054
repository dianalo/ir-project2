The holders gave Rupert Murdoch the green light to issueas many as 65 million additional shares over time, hoping toput the media giant on a sounder financial footing as itstrives to reduce debt. A year ago, News Corp. was facing athreatened liquidity crisis over its debt of 10.5 billionAustralian dollars (US$8.2 billion). But it has sincestretched out loan repayments, and analysts say debt couldshrink to around A$9 billion by June 30.</LP><TEXT>   Several respected analysts here and in the U.S. areplugging the stock, although a few American bears predict itwill decline. The shares have jumped from A$3.19 early thisyear, closing Friday at A$14.12, down 32 cents, on theAustralian Stock Exchange.   News Corp. hopes to launch an international offering of37.2 million new shares soon, perhaps late this week, andsuggests that despite the chilly climate for stock salesnowadays, the size of the offering might even be increased.Lead underwriters for the U.S. portion will be Allen andamp; Co.and Morgan Stanley.   Profit growth &quot;is being fed by debt reduction and costcutting&quot; rather than relying on a strong economic recovery inNews Corp.'s key markets of Australia, Britain and the U.S.,says Terry Povey, analyst with ANZ McCaughan Securities inLondon. Given the added prospect of &quot;a major upside leg wheneconomies turn up,&quot; he's telling clients to buy in hopes thestock will hit A$20 next year.   For the fiscal year ending June 30, ANZ McCaughan expectsNews Corp. to earn A$450 million after taxes, or A$1.20 ashare; the estimate for the following year is A$1.90 a share.The forecasts are adjusted for new share issues, but excludeone-time items. News Corp. earned A$321.3 million in the mostrecent year before a write-down put it in the red.   A News Corp. spokesman declined to comment on the profitoutlook, citing the planned offering. But News Corp. has saidit intends to raise about US$450 million by issuing 16.1million American depositary receipts -- each representing twoshares -- for U.S. investors and five million shareselsewhere. (The ADRs fell 3/4 Friday on the New York StockExchange, to 21 3/4.) News Corp. also has raised US$180million through the private placement of some convertiblepreference shares. Such moves, plus conversion of some notesnext year, are likely to dilute Mr. Murdoch's control of NewsCorp. to 40% from the current 44.5%, the spokesman says.   Helping the company are lower world interest rates,completion of a costly British printing expansion and thedeferral of some capital spending in Australia. Operatingcash flow, before interest, is improving. The company says ithas slashed losses at British Sky Broadcasting Ltd., its48%-owned British satellite television venture. And NewsCorp. still has a low effective tax rate -- the past twoyears it has paid about 2% compared with the Australiancorporate tax rate of 39% -- which helps inflate earningsand, some analysts argue, makes it difficult to compare withother international media stocks.   &quot;They've overcome the {debt} crisis,&quot; says Viktor Shvets,an analyst at Baring Securities (Australia) Ltd. Still, inthe short to medium term the stock &quot;isn't going anywhere.&quot; Heexpects News Corp. to tap the markets with more equityissues, perhaps for as much as US$1 billion, within 12months. Mr. Shvets adds that despite an upgrading of some ofits debt securities last month by Moody's Investors Service,News Corp. would &quot;have to do a helluva lot more&quot; to attain aninvestment-grade credit rating.   In the U.S., bearish investor James Chanos, head ofKynikos Associates, is among a good-sized crowd ofshort-sellers betting that the shares will tumble. News Corp.paid too much for many of its media properties and used toomuch debt to buy them, the shorts argue. A recent Kynikosreport contends that News Corp. &quot;is losing money&quot; on anoperating basis and that high yields on News Corp. bondsreflect a perception of high financial risk.   &quot;News Corp.'s bondholders are expressing, through thepricing mechanism, a significant concern that they will notbe made whole, while stock market investors believe there istremendous residual value for the equity,&quot; Kynikos says; itargues that bondholders are right and the stock is headed forsingle digits. A senior News Corp. official scoffs at theKynikos report, saying it contains a substantialmiscalculation regarding News Corp.'s cash flow.   ---   News Corp.
