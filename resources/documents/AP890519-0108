The move amounted toimposition of martial law.   After the announcement, students said they would resume a hungerstrike in central Tiananmen Square, which they had called off hoursearlier. They vowed to remain in the square to press their demandsfor democratic reforms.   Premier Li Peng made the announcement in front of an audience ofseveral thousand at the Great Hall of the People, the national seatof government.   President Yang Shangkun attended, but Communist Party GeneralSecretary Zhao Ziyang was not seen in the national televisionbroadcast of the speech. Sources said Zhao, who opposed acrackdown, offered to resign Friday.   Li said students were not trying to disrupt social order butthat a few were taking advantage of the situation to create turmoil.   The usually soft-spoken premier raised his voice andoccasionally waved his fist as he demanded the students end theirprotests, which have evolved into the biggest show of defiance inChina's 40 years of communist rule.   The party, government and military leaders in the audience,mostly elderly, clapped perfunctorily. Many had grim expressions.   President Yang, speaking next, said: ``Beijing has been in astate of anarchy. I completely support Li Peng's report.... If thesituation were to continue, our capital would no longer be acapital.''   He said troops had come from outside Beijing to restore order.However, both Yang and Li said the action was not directed againstthe students.   Beijing residents said troops were poised on a main street nearthe city center and that some were entering downtown by subway. Astudent who ran to central Tiananmen Square from the west said hesaw 10 to 15 army trucks immobilized in the street by residents.   No troops had arrived in the square more than an hour after Li'sannouncement, which was broadcast on national television.   Protesters in the square drowned out the broadcast for severalminutes by singing ``The Internationale,'' the song of the worldcommunist movement. They then began chanting, ``Li Peng, stepdown!''   Yang said the troops were sent in to protect importantministries and key installations.   ``The Liberation Army is here to protect Beijing society, itspeople and its future. We were forced to send the Liberation Armyinto the city.'' he said.   Li described the situation in Beijing as ``anarchic andchaotic.''   ``We have been reasonable for more than one month. In the worldthere's no government like that,'' he said. ``The Communist Partywill resolutely deal with all turmoil and not allow it to interferewith society.''   Li claimed that ``a handful of persons'' seeking to overthrowthe government ``are using the hunger strikers as hostages tocoerce and force the party and the government to yield to theirpolitical demands. In this regard, they have no iota of humanism.''   ``It has become more and more clear that the very few people whoattempt to create turmoil want to reach their political goals _negating the leadership of the Communist Party of China and thesocialist system and violating the constitution,'' he said.   Upon hearing the broadcast, people swarmed toward TiananmenSquare, where about 100,000 people already were gathered. Thousandswere clustered on nearby streets.   The students vowed to remain until the government meets theirdemands, which include a dialogue on political reforms, pressfreedom, and an end to official corruption. They called onclassmates to remain passive if troops tried to force them out.   ``Tonight we have to stay here for the future of China,'' said astudent from the central city of Hangzhou.   ``I thought we were close to victory. Now I see it's far away,''said another.   About 3,000 students began a hunger strike in the square onSaturday and agreed late Friday to end it, but they revoked thatdecision after Li's announcement.   Communist Party chief Zhao, accompanied by Li, visited some ofthe strikers before dawn, boarding buses where they had soughtshelter from a rainstorm.   ``I came too late, too late. I should be criticized by you,''strikers quoted Zhao as saying. Students of Beijing NormalUniversity said Zhao had tears in his eyes as he spoke to them andautographed their hats and shirts.   He said the ``problems you have raised will eventually beresolved,'' but he made no concrete offer, the students said.   ``He was very sincere, he was sympathetic and understanding,''said Chen Hong, a 22-year-old math major, who spoke with difficultythrough cracked lips.   The students said Li stayed a few minutes and said little.   Two sources said Zhao offered to resign after his four fellowmembers on the Standing Committee of the Politburo, the party'shighest decision-making body, rejected his proposal that they reachan agreement with the protesters.   The committee said the matter would have to be considered by alarger party body, either the entire Politburo or the CentralCommittee.   Tens of thousands of people arrived by train from across Chinatoday to parade around Tiananmen. Many young people and workersmarched along with truckloads of uniformed police and army and navycadets.   Messages were chalked on walls throughout the city criticizingsenior leader Deng Xiaoping. The prestigious Chinese Academy ofSocial Sciences took up the call for Deng to retire by stretching abanner across a driveway of the Great Hall of the People, whichfaces Tiananmen Square.   Deng, 84, reportedly wanted to crack down on the students whenthey began their protests in mid-April but was unable to because oftheir large numbers and strong public support.</TEXT></DOC>
