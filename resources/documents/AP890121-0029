I take as my guide the hope of asaint in crucial things _ unity; in important things _ diversity, inall things, generosity.   America today is a proud, free nation, decent and civil _ a placewe cannot help but love. We know in our hearts, not loudly andproudly, but as a simple fact, that this country has meaning beyondwhat we see, and that our strength is a force for good.   But have we changed as nation, even in our time? Are weenthralled with material things, less appreciative of the nobilityof work and sacrifice?   My friends, we are not the sum of our possessions. They are notthe measure of our lives. In our hearts we know what matters. Wecannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car, a bigger bankaccount. We must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be aloyal friend, a loving parent, a citizen who leaves his home, hisneighborhood and town better than he found it.   And what do we want the men and women who work with us to saywhen we're no longer there? That we were more driven to succeed thananyone around us? Or that we stopped to ask if a sick child hadgotten better and stayed a moment there to trade a word offriendship.   No president, no government, can teach us to remember what isbest in what we are. But if the man you have chosen to lead thisgovernment can help make a difference; if he can celebrate thequieter, deeper successes that are made not of gold and silk, but ofbetter hearts and finer souls; if he can do these things, then hemust.   America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in highmoral principle. We as a people have such a purpose today. It is tomake kinder the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world.   My friends, we have work to do. There are the homeless, lost androaming _ there are the children who have nothing, no love, nonormalcy _ there are those who cannot free themselves of enslavementto whatever addiction _ drugs, welfare, demoralization that rulesthe slums. There is crime to be conquered, the rough crime of thestreets. There are young women to be helped who are about to becomemothers of children they can't care for and might not love. Theyneed our care, our guidance, and education; though we bless them forchoosing life.   The old solution, the old way, was to think that public moneyalone could end these problems. But we have learned that that is notso. And in any case, our funds are low. We have a deficit to bringdown. We have more will than wallet; but will is what we need.   We will make the hard choices, looking at what we have, perhapsallocating it differently, making our decisions based on honest needand prudent safety.   And then we will do the wisest thing of all: we will turn to theonly resource we have that in times of need always grows: thegoodness and the courage of the American people.</TEXT><HEAD>MORE</HEAD></DOC>
