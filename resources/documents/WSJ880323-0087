The mildness of the penalties appeared likely to widen a rift between Japan and the U.S. over the Toshiba affair and could increase the chances Congress will approve a bill to ban all Toshiba imports, including those of Toshiba Machine's parent, Toshiba Corp., Japan's second-largest electronics maker.    The Reagan administration opposes the legislation. A Commerce Department official, noting the likely angry reaction in Congress, said the ruling couldn't have come &quot;at a worse possible time.&quot;    The Tokyo judge said Toshiba Machine's actions &quot;seriously damaged the economic activities, foreign relations and trade policies of our nation.&quot;    Toshiba Machine sold $17 million of advanced milling machines to the Soviet Union between 1982 and 1984. U.S. officials said the machines helped Moscow build propellers that make submarines quieter and harder to detect.    Japan's statute of limitations has run out for the sale of the machine tools, so Toshiba and the defendants were charged with exporting software and parts in violation of laws based on a 16-nation agreement to restrict high-technology sales to Communist countries.    Hiroaki Tanimura, former deputy section chief in the machine-tool division of the Numazu plant where the merchandise originiated, was given a suspended one-year sentence and Ryuzo Hayashi, former manager of the plant's casting division, received a suspended 10-month sentence.    Toshiba Corp. has denied it had any knowledge of the sale and promised to take steps to prevent a recurrence. </TEXT></DOC>
