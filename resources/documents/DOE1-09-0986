However, this containsmany problems. The ''Energy Balance Table'' issued by the Energy EconomicsResearch Institute of Japan provides energy statistics which is almostfree from the problems contained in the Integral Energy Statistics. Energystatistics in particular fields include electric power statistics, petroleumstatistics, gas statistics, and coal statistics. Most of the statisticsabove reflect emphasis on the supply side. Statistics reflecting emphasison the demand side include the ''Energy Consumption Structure Statistics''(retitledin 1983 ''Petroleum and Other Energy Consumption Structure Statistics'')and the ''Petroleum and Other Energy Consumption Trend Statistics'' issuedby the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Statistic data canbe easily utilized if it is implemented in a database. There are someofficial databases which are available through computer communication.It would be beneficial to users if statistical data is available in floppydisks or similar media.
