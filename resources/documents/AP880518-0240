The public accounting proposition headed a list of eightprinciples backed by Connor's group and 13 others as a ``bill ofrights'' that should govern efforts to clean up DOE weapons plants.   Though the coalition includes some groups that ordinarily opposenuclear weapons, Connor said, ``This is not a ban-the-bombstatement.''   To illustrate the diversity of views represented in thecoalition, Connor said, ``There is a good case to be made, in myview, for a new production reactor for tritium production.''   In July, the department is expected to propose development of anew reactor to produce tritium for weapons. Tritium decays instorage and must be refreshed in stockpiled weapons.   The sole active tritium reactor, at the Savannah River Plant inSouth Carolina, is operating at half power because of safetyconcerns.   The department has conceded that the nation is ``awash'' inplutonium, the other weapons material, from previous production andrecycling of old weapons. It is putting a plutonium reactor at theHanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state on standby.   Connor appeared at a news conference sponsored by TheEnvironmental Policy Institute, a Washington-based lobbyingorganization for environmentalist causes. Another speaker, LisaCrawford of Fernald Residents for Safety and Health, said, ``Wehave never once said shut the facility down. We have said clean itup and operate it safely.''   Her group concerns itself with the department's plant inFernald, Ohio.   The other points in the coalition's ``bill of rights'' calledfor independent licensing of new plants and indepedent safetyregulation; public participation in licensing; ending of currentexemptions and compliance with all federal and state environmentallaws; a federal commitment to pay all cleanup costs; long-termhealth studies of nearby residents; job retraining for displacedworkers when plants close; and a pledge that production decisionswill not be made for pork-barrel purposes.   Many of these points are addressed in bills in Congress, but thecoalition is not supporting a specific bill. ``Bits and pieces'' ofeach deserve support, Connor said.   The House has approved a provision for a safety oversight boardwithin the Energy Department, and spokesman Will Callicott said thedepartment was not opposing it. He would not comment on the callfor public accounting.   Other groups participating Wednesday were: Greenpeace; AmericanFriends Service Committee; Puget Sound SANE, Seattle; PalouseClearwater Hanford Watch, Moscow, Idaho; Ohio Public InterestCampaign, Cincinnati; Northwest Nuclear Safety Campaign, Seattle;Snake River Alliance, Ketchum, Idaho; Energy Research Foundation,Columbia, S.C.; Colorado Peace Network, Denver; Coalition for SafePower, Portland, Ore.; and Citizens Against Rocky FlatsContamination, Denver.</TEXT></DOC>
