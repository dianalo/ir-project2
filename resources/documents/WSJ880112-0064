Indeed, Mr. Reagan, in a speech to the City Club of Cleveland intended to bolster confidence in the economy, portrayed the trade deficit as a sign of economic strength.    Mr. Reagan said he didn't believe the nation is heading into a recession and said the U.S. and its trading partners are working to stabilize the U.S. dollar. &quot;I don't anticipate a recession unless some of those doom-criers scare the people into one,&quot; he said.    The president, who aides said has read at least part of the Brady commission report about the Oct. 19 stock market crash, appeared to misread its conclusions. He said incorrectly that the commission exonerated his administration's policies as a factor in the stock market crash.    &quot;First of all, I don't believe that the dollar or anything outside Wall Street and the markets had anything to do with the great debacle in October. And that is borne out in the report that has been presented to me by the commission that I appointed, the Brady commission,&quot; Mr. Reagan said.    But part of the Brady study, issued Friday, called budget deficits &quot;the unwanted and unpleasant stepchild of Reaganomics&quot; and listed concerns about budget and trade deficits first in a series of six &quot;events in world financial markets that laid the groundwork for a significant correction&quot; in the stock market.    Asked specifically about the &quot;stepchild&quot; analysis by the commission -- which was headed by Dillon Read andamp; Co. chairman Nicholas Brady -- the president insisted the blame for federal budget deficits rests on Congress, not himself. &quot;I have no quarrel with the fact that government spending -- deficit spending -- is a drag on our economy, and must be eliminated,&quot; he said. &quot;We're trying. But when I hear them call it a stepchild of mine, I'd like to point out something: the president of the United States cannot spend a dime.&quot;    Mr. Reagan charged that &quot;in five years, Congress has cut $125 billion from defense spending but not to reduce the deficit, because they've added $250 billion to domestic spending that is not defense.&quot; Actually Congress approved a huge defense buildup during Mr. Reagan's tenure, with defense outlays rising from $157.5 billion in fiscal 1981 to $294 billion in fiscal 1989. Discretionary nondefense spending has risen at a slower pace, from $168 billion in 1981 to $185 billion in 1989.    The president said he was &quot;as determined as ever&quot; to reduce the deficit. &quot;You can't do it in one year but you can get it on a course,&quot; he said, arguing that the present Gramm-Rudman legislation has it on just such a course. Noting that the U.S. economy has just completed 62 months of expansion, he said every index points to continued expansion.    &quot;I don't think the signs of recession are there. I'll tell you what does frighten me. When I see sometimes in the media all this great emphasis in quoting people about pessimism and this looks like there's a recession coming. That could bring on bad times and a recession,&quot; the president said.    Mr. Reagan's comments, coming after Friday's drop of 140.58 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, were designed &quot;to point out that the economy is in good shape and all this doomsday talk is wrong,&quot; said Marlin Fitzwater, the president's spokesman.    The president, asked by a member of the audience whether he's concerned about the dollar's fall, indicated that he believes the present international coordination effort is working adequately. &quot;With regard to the dollar, we have an agreement with our most potent trading partners about together working to maintain the stability in the ratio of all our currencies. And we are working at that and what we want is stability in the value of the dollar.&quot;    In his speech, Mr. Reagan argued that &quot;trade deficits and inflows of foreign capital are not necessarily a sign of an economy's weakness,&quot; and observed that the U.S. continues to attract investment from around the world.    Comparing the trade deficit to California's external debt to other states and countries, he said &quot;Does this augur bad days ahead for California? On the contrary, one might argue it's a sign of strength.&quot; He observed that trade deficits didn't hold back America's first 100 years of development. &quot;Now, some people call this debt. By that way of thinking, every time a company sold stock, it would be a sign of weakness,&quot; he said, hailing the $159 billion in current foreign investments in the U.S.    Merchandise trade figures for November, which are to be announced Friday, are expected to show some improvement from the record monthly deficit of $17.6 billion in October. </TEXT></DOC>
