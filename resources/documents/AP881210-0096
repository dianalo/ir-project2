Several dozen people were reported injured, including RafaelaGuanes de Laino, wife of arrested opposition leader Domingo Laino;and Ilde Silvero, director of the Roman Catholic weekly publicationSendero.   Several demonstrators were arrested.   Police prevented people from entering the national cathedral,where a pre-march Mass was celebrated at noon, and dispersed a crowdof 300 at the office of the United Nations. The groups were to havemarched between the two buildings in downtown Asuncion, which waspacked with shoppers.   When about 700 people gathered again at the U.N. office, securityforces waded into the crowd and beat demonstrators and shoppers.   The incident quickly turned into a demonstration against thepresident, Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. The government had banned themarch, saying it was intended as an anti-Stroessner protest.   ``The military dictatorship is going to fall!'' the demonstratorschanted. ``The people, united, can never be defeated!''   Small groups of protesters gathered at streetcorners, chantinganti-government slogans and then dispersing before police couldattack them.   ``We should keep fighting for the effectiveness and respect ofhuman rights in Paraguay, within the framework of non-violence,''Carlos Romero Pereira, a leader of dissidents within the governingColorado Party, said in front of the ABC-Color newspaper building.The paper was closed by the government in 1984.   Euclides Acevedo, president of the opposition RevolutionaryFebrerista Party, said the repression of the marchers reflectedParaguay's ``prehistoric state of authoritarianism'' underStroessner's 34-year rule.   The march was organized by groups representing students, unions,churches and opposition political parties.   The universal declaration, adopted without dissent by the GeneralAssembly on Dec. 10, 1948, is the basic U.N. document under whichmember nations pledge to safeguard life and liberty and abolishtorture and slavery.</TEXT></DOC>
