Samuel J. Simon, 50 years old, pleaded guilty in federal court here to one count each of tax evasion and wire fraud.    According to U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, Mr. Simon was general partner of Great Salt Lake Drilling; Rocky Mountain Drilling Associates; Midcontinent Drilling Associates, I and II; and Petro Tech Partnerships I, II, III and V, and embezzled the money from the eight entities during a three-year period.    Mr. Simon, who waived indictment and admitted to charges made by the U.S. attorney, faces a maximum 10 years in jail and fines of $100,001 at his sentencing Feb. 11. His lawyer, Franklin Velie, said Mr. Simon feels &quot;terribly sorry&quot; for what happened.    Mr. Simon said during his plea that he took the money to cover gambling losses, but that his compulsion for gambling now is under control. </TEXT></DOC>
