Mitsubishi plans to bid with Royal Dutch/Shell Group, thegiant Anglo-Dutch oil company. Mitsui's bid will be made withMcDermott International Inc. and the Marathon Oil Co. unit ofUSX Corp., both of the U.S. Other companies from Japan, theU.S., South Korea and Australia also are expected to bid.   The project calls for development of oil and gas off theisland's east side, industry officials said. Two fields inthe area, Piltun-Astovskoe and Lunkoe, are believed to havesubstantial reserves.   A joint body of the Soviet oil and gas ministry and theRussian republic's state energy committee is expected toaccept the bids at the end of this month. The winner willconduct feasibility studies and then develop the area withthe Soviets.

Mr. Bagsik, 28 years old, ispresident of a private firm, Art-B, which allegedly exploitedbanking system loopholes. But Mr. Bagsik, who left for Israelbefore the scandal broke, was quoted in the Polish press assaying he had no plans to return. Israel and Poland have noextradition pact.

Monthly increases will double by December 1992 theprice of gas at the pump, at 28 cents a gallon now among theworld's lowest. The walkout was organized by 89 unions withone million workers. A 35,000-member union of Caracas workersrefused to take part, blunting the strike's effect in thecapital.

The Leipzig center's first-year budget will be 50 millionto 60 million marks ($28.9 million to $34.7 million), 90% ofwhich will be provided by the federal government and 10% bythe eastern states of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt.   The Treuhandanstalt, the federal agency that is sellingformer East German state-run businesses, has struggled tofind buyers for the region's dilapidated chemical operations,their financial morass complicated by potentially bigenvironmental cleanup costs. The area includes afilm-production site in Wolfen, chemicals complexes inBitterfeld and Leuna, and a polystyrene factory in Buna.   The research center, the first in Germany dedicated solelyto the environment, is to form modernization and cleanupplans and make recommendations for polluted industrialregions.
