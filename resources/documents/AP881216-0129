Wholesale prices edged up just 0.3 percent in November as foodcosts at the wholesale level showed no increases for the secondstraight month, the Labor Department said.   The November increase, if it persisted for 12 months, wouldamount to an annual inflation rate of just 3.3 percent, lower thanthe 3.8 percent annualized rate for the first 11 months of 1987.   ``Inflationary fears exceed inflationary reality at the presenttime,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting atGeorgia State University in Atlanta.   Those fears were aggravated earlier this week when the governmentreported that industrial production rose another half a percentagepoint in November and that factories were operating at a nine-yearhigh of 84.2 percent of their capacity.   Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association ofWholesalers-Distributors, said he sees no indication from theassociation's 45,000 member companies that they are buildinginventories in anticipation of future price spikes.   Van Dongen called the inflationary fears a ``manifestation oftribal rites in Washington and on the New York financial circuits''with the changing of presidential administrations.   ``Let's keep the debate a little bit honest,'' he said. ``I don'tsee an inflationary psychology taking root, but Washington can talkitself into all sorts of things. There's a lot of speculationswirling around about policy, the Federal Reserve, what a newadministration is going to do.''   Gasoline prices rose 3.4 percent and home heating oil skyrocketed12.2 percent despite a 0.5 percent drop in crude oil prices. Naturalgas prices, however, fell 2.5 percent, sending overall energy pricesup just 1.2 percent. Heating oil prices had fallen 10 percent theprevious month.   ``Even with the big spikes in energy, there just isn't a wholelot of inflation out there,'' said Sandra Shaber, an economist forthe Futures Group, a Washington consulting group. ``To have that,you have to find things that become chronic, and you just don't seethat anywhere.''   Ratajczak said the gasoline and heating oil price increases maybe partly due to the establishment of new production quotas lastmonth by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   ``Oil prices probably will end this year slightly higher thanoriginally expected because of response to the latest OPECagreement,'' Ratajczak said.   However, he added that the OPEC agreement will become``unmanageable'' by by next spring and prices will fall again,moderating price increases for chemcials and plastics as well.   Food prices, which the summer drought had pushed up at an annualrate of 8 percent, showed no overall change last month after falling0.1 percent in October.   Prices for fresh fruits jumped 9.4 percent, while those forcanned fruits and vegetables gained 1.1 percent.   Pork and beef prices each dropped by about half a percentagepoint. Large declines also were recorded for a wide variety of otherfood items, with egg prices off 14.5 percent, rice down 2.7 percent,pasta products off 4.7 percent, chickens off 7.4 percent, turkeysdown 4.1 percent and coffee off 2.9 percent.   Grocery shoppers can expect even better news in the months ahead.The Labor Department's price index for crude foodstuffs such asgrains and livestock fell 6 percent in November, the largest monthlydrop since June 1974.   Finished goods other than food and energy posted a 0.3 percentgain, the same as the overall rate. Price gains accelerated,however, for prescription drugs, detergents, books and newspapers.   After falling a month earlier, prices turned upward for householdappliances, over-the-counter drugs, jewelry and sporting goods.   Wholesale automobile prices were off 0.1 percent after a 1.7percent decline in October. Capital equipment costs rose 0.3percent, erasing a decline of the same magnitude in October.   ``In the increasing concern about inflation, many have failed tonote that industrial commodity prices have increased less in 1988than in 1987,'' Ratajczak said.   The overall November increase left the Producer Price Index forfinished goods at 109.7, meaning that a hypothetical selection ofgoods costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $109.70 last month, 40cents more than in October.</TEXT></DOC>
