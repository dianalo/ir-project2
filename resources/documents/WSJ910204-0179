The Labor Department reported Friday that the unemploymentrate rose to 6.2% in January from 6.1% in December, whilepayroll employment took an unexpected nosedive. Thedisappointing report shattered the hopes of many economiststhat the recession in the U.S. would be short and shallow.</LP><TEXT>   About 45 minutes after the report's release, the Fedsurprised financial markets by announcing it was cutting thebellwether discount interest rate to 6% from 6.5%. It was thesecond discount-rate cut in less than two months, and markeda major escalation of the Fed's anti-recession campaign.   &quot;Before they were easing with firecrackers,&quot; said NealSoss, chief economist at First Boston Corp. &quot;Now they areeasing with cannons.&quot;   The discount rate is the interest rate the Fed charges onloans to banks, and is largely symbolic. But the central bankmade it clear Friday that it was also cutting the importantfederal funds interest rate to about 6.25% from 6.75%. Thefed funds rate is the rate banks charge on loans to oneanother, and heavily influences other rates. In response tothe Fed's action, several of the nation's largest bankslowered their prime lending rates to 9% from 9.5%. That willtranslate into lower interest rates for many businessborrowers and for homeowners with home-equity loans.   The Fed's rate-cutting move came just one day after amajor interest-rate increase by the Bundesbank, Germany'scentral bank, and underscored how economic conditions arediverging sharply in the industrialized world this year. FedChairman Alan Greenspan and Bundesbank President Karl OttoPoehl are said to have consulted with each other extensivelybefore changing the rates.   After making such a big move, the Federal Reserve may nowput its rate-cutting effort on hold for a while. The Fed'spolicysetting committee meets tomorrow and Wednesday to setpolicy for the next several weeks and to set goals for theyear.   But many analysts said the economy is so weak that furtherinterest-rate cuts are inevitable, particularly if theeconomy continues to deteriorate and the money supply growslanguidly. &quot;They eased Friday because the current snapshot ofthe economy gave them a horrific picture,&quot; said LawrenceLeuzzi, managing director at S.G. Warburg andamp; Co. The Fed &quot;willdefinitely be easing again, it is only a question of time.&quot;   Added Susan Hering of Salomon Brothers, &quot;Efforts to combatthe deepening recession are shifting into high gear as policymakers bring out the heavy artillery.&quot;   The bond market rallied powerfully Friday as manyinvestors were caught off guard by the Fed's discount ratecut.   Mr. Leuzzi expects to see strong demand in this week'ssale of $34.5 billion in Treasury debt in the form of newthree- and 10-year Treasury notes and 30-year bonds.   Additional signs of economic weakness will make the10-year note and 30-year bond attractive, he said, becauseinflation expectations will fall further still.   George Gianaris, sales manager at Daiwa Securities AmericaInc., says: &quot;Investors were surprised by the weakness of theemployment numbers Friday morning, and the immediate reactionby the Federal Reserve to lower the discount rate. This makestheir choices in the auctions this week much more difficult.The question is, with a weak economy, how high can bondprices go?&quot;   The number of jobs plunged by 232,000 in January. Over thepast four months, job losses have averaged 205,000 a month.The harshest message that the recession didn't bottom out inDecember was delivered to the already beleagueredconstruction industry, where 155,000 jobs were lost inJanuary. Janet Norwood, commissioner of the LaborDepartment's Bureau of Labor Statistics, said some of thedecline was caused by bad weather, but said that constructionjob losses are &quot;approaching 10% of this industry'semployment.&quot;   &quot;I guess the best way to put it is it's shocking,&quot; saidSung Won Sohn, economist with Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.&quot;This shows the recession is alive and well. It bashes anyhope the recession was coming to an end.&quot;   The unemployment rate rose in eight of the 11 biggeststates. The rate in Massachusetts surged to 8.6% in January;it was 4.6% a year earlier.   In another reflection of the deteriorating economy, theNational Association of Purchasing Management's monthly indexfell to 37.7 from 40.5. A reading below 50 indicates thefactory sector is shrinking. The index is at the lowest levelsince hitting 35.5 in May 1982 during the prior recession.   This &quot;confirms the anemic condition of the economy,&quot; saidRobert Bretz, director of corporate purchasing at PitneyBowes Inc. and chairman of the association's surveycommittee. &quot;I don't think we've bottomed out at all.&quot;   Mr. Bretz said he won't be convinced that the worst of therecession has passed until the association's measure of neworders, which has been falling for seven months, picks up.Last month, 41% of the respondents said new orders wereweaker than the month before; 44% said they were the same;15% said they were better. The new orders index is at thelowest level since November 1981.   The new reports did provide some signs that inflationpressures are abating -- signs that were noted at the Fed andwhich helped clear the way for the central bank'scredit-easing move. The average hourly earnings of non-farmworkers edged down in January to $10.18 from $10.19. And thepurchasing managers report also indicated prices forcommodities and other goods purchased by manufacturers fellin January, after rising for seven consecutive months.   Many economists had been expecting a small increase innonagricultural jobs in January, partly because pre-Christmashiring for retail businesses was extremely sluggish. TheLabor Department's seasonal adjustment, based on theexperience of past non-recession years, tries to compensatefor the usual January layoffs of temporary holiday workers.But because those workers weren't hired in the first placethis season, economists were expecting the seasonaladjustment to push the numbers up artificially.   Retail trade was the only industry segment to see anysignificant job growth last month, adding 85,000 positions.But Ms. Norwood said she believed the figures were&quot;exaggerated by seasonal adjustment&quot; and that the &quot;underlyingtrend in retail trade employment continues to be quite weak.&quot;   What economists weren't looking for was the uniformly badnews outside the retail sector. In addition to theconstruction losses, manufacturing employment fell by 70,000jobs. In that sector alone, 900,000 jobs have been cut sincethe end of 1988. The service industry's growth of recentmonths stalled in January, and the length of the averagework-week shrank by a big one-half hour to 34.1 hours,reversing a gain in December of 0.2 of an hour, which hadpuzzled economists. &quot;It was a blight all around, except forretail,&quot; said Mr. Sohn of Norwest.   One particularly worrisome aspect of the report was thatit was the first gauge of economic activity in a period whenthe Persian Gulf war was raging. If the employment data are aharbinger of how the economy will be affected throughout thewar, the recession could turn out much worse than expected.Economists will be watching closely as economic reports to bereleased over the next several days fill out the Januarypicture.   &quot;The next 10 days will give us a sense of how people arefeeling about making commitments since the war has started,&quot;said Nancy Sidhu, an economist with Security Pacific NationalBank in Los Angeles.   The unemployment rate is drawn from a survey ofhouseholds, unlike the payroll data, which are produced froma survey of businesses.   In another report, the Commerce Department saidconstruction spending continued declining in December,falling 0.5% to a seasonally adjusted $415.1 billion annualrate. That followed a fall of 1.5% in November to a revised$417.1 billion annual rate. The November decrease waspreviously estimated as 0.6%. The December level was 3.9%below the year-earlier pace.   The report said construction spending totaled $434.9billion in 1990, a 0.6% increase from $432.1 billion in 1989.After adjustment for inflation, total spending in 1990slipped 1.4% from 1989.   ---                         EMPLOYMENT                                                                                                          Here are excerpts from the Labor Department's employmentreport.
