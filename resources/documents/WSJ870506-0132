At least five political and strategic objectives are discernible in this latest disinformation campaign:    --discredit the U.S. by falsely claiming that AIDS originated in CIA-Pentagon experiments;    -- discourage undesirable political contact withWesterners, who are portrayed as potential carriers of thedisease;   --create pressure for the removal of U.S. military bases overseas on the grounds that U.S. service personnel spread AIDS;    -- undermine U.S. credibility in the Third World bymaintaining that hypotheses about the African origin of AIDSare an example of Western, and especially American, racism;   --divert attention from Soviet research on biological warfare and genetic engineering, and neutralize accusations that the U.S.S.R. has used bio-chemical agents in Asia. </TEXT></DOC>
