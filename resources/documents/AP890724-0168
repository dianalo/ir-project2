Dr. James Wyngaarden told the Senate Labor and Human ResourcesCommittee that the intellectual stimulation, prestige and researchfreedom offered by the government institutes is not enough toattract and keep top scientists.   A change, the NIH director said, ``is essential to restoring NIHto a fully competitive posture and demonstrating the commitment ofthe federal government to maintaining a first-class biomedicalresearch program.''   Of the 176 NIH staff who are members of the Senior ExecutiveService, 53 are physicians and 104 have doctorate degrees, he said.   Senior Executive Service physicians are paid about half as muchas their counterparts at university research centers, and thosewith doctoral degrees are paid 19 percent less than those incomparable academic positions, he said.   Additionally, the gap between NIH physician salaries and the paythey would receive at a U.S. medical school has widened to about$99,000, he said.   ``Many of our senior scientists are considering whether toremain with NIH because of these salary considerations,'' saidWyngaarden, who was appointed by then-President Reagan in 1982 andis leaving NIH at the end of the month. A replacement hasn't beennominated by President Bush.   Wyngaarden said he is encouraged by President Bush's recentproposal to raise salaries for employees in senior positionsrequiring specialized and critical skills. Under his plan, pay forsenior government workers generally would go up by as much as 25percent.   At NIH, top pay for a senior doctoral scientist is $76,400before bonuses. The ceiling for a senior physician is $96,400.Bonuses can boost that to a maximum of $99,000, said NIH spokesmanStorm Whaley.   According to a recent NIH survey to which a quarter of its Ph.D.scientists and science managers responded, 83 percent reportedreceiving one or more employment offers ranging from $100,000 to$500,000, Wyngaarden said. The average offer was $166,000, he said.   ``With offers of this magnitude, NIH can expect to lose asubstantial number of key senior research scientists and sciencemanagers,'' he said.   Low pay has also hampered recruiting efforts, he said.   ``Since 1980, NIH has not been able to recruit a single researchscientist into the Senior Executive Service from the private oracademic sectors to engage in the independent conduct of a clinicalor basic biomedical research program,'' the director said.</TEXT></DOC>
