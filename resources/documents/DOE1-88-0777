The South African republic, immediately northof the Republic of South Africa, achieved steady real economic growthwith improved social services and provision for its people's basic needs.This was achieved in spite of world recession and drought because itsmineral wealth was reserved for the people and mining companies had topay for the privilege of extracting that wealth through a tax programlimited to appropriating its surplus, while assuring the investors andentrepreneurs and adequate long-term return on capital and enterprise.But sound macroeconomic policies failed to provide even reasonably equitablebenefits for the majority of the people. Sound micropolicies are neededto widen access to employment and earned income and to asset accumulation.</TEXT></DOC>
