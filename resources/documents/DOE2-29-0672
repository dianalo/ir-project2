Emphasis has been placedon input data coding. When data is retreaved the translation into plainlanguage of stored coded information is done automatically by computer.Three keys each, list the complete set of currently defined codes forthe NAGRADATA system, namely codes with appropriate definitions, arranged:1. according to subject matter (thematically) 2. the codes listed alphabeticallyand 3. the definitions listed alphabetically. Additional explanationis provided for the proper application of the codes and the logic behindthe creation of new codes to be used within the NAGRADATA system. NAGRADATAmakes use of codes instead of plain language for data storage; this offersthe following advantages: speed of data processing, mainly data retrieval,economies of storage memory requirements, the standardisation of terminology.The nature of this thesaurian type 'key to codes' makes it impossibleto either establish a final form or to cover the entire spectrum of requirements.Therefore, this first issue of codes to NAGRADATA must be consideredto represent the current state of progress of a living system and futureeditions will be issued in a loose leave ringbook system which can beupdated by an organised (updating) service.</TEXT></DOC>
