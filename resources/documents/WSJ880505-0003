Schlesinger (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> C LABOR </CO><IN> AUT </IN><DATELINE> HIGHLAND PARK, Mich.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chrysler Corp. and the United Auto Workers union reached a tentative settlement on a new national contract that matches those reached last year at Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp.    The agreement, covering about 60,000 active workers, includes a signing bonus pegged to Chrysler's 1987 profit. The union didn't reveal the size of the bonus, but President Owen Bieber said at a news conference announcing the accord last night that it involved &quot;a substantial number of bucks.&quot; The total would reportedly be about $1,500 for each worker, including $500 workers were already owed under the old contract.    The contract also includes a promise, similar to that made by the company at the opening of the talks, that Chrysler senior executives won't receive cash or stock bonuses in years that workers don't receive profit sharing. Those executives, however, will still be able to receive and cash in stock options during those years. The union called the provision &quot;a major breakthrough on the principle of shared sacrifice and reward.&quot;    Chrysler's top negotiator, Anthony P. St. John, at a separate news conference, called the contract &quot;affordable and equitable.&quot; But because Chrysler failed to tailor it to recognize any differences in its relatively high retiree base, he acknowledged that the No. 3 auto maker's labor costs for each worker would rise to about $3-an-hour higher than GM's and 50-cents-an-hour higher than Ford's when the contracts expire in 1990.    However, the company didn't walk away from the table empty handed. The UAW promised to work harder to change work rules in local contracts in order to improve quality and efficiency, which Mr. St. John said may help to offset the higher compensation costs.    Chrysler also agreed to spend as much as $230 million on a new job-security plan. The total is proportionately less than the amount Ford agreed to last year in its contract. Chrysler also fended off union attempts to block plans announced earlier this year to close or sell four parts plants. It also got some changes in its prescription-drug provisions.    The union's rank-and-file leadership will meet in Dearborn, Mich., tomorrow to consider the pact, which will then be submitted to the rank and file for ratification next week.    The contract is symbolically important for the UAW. By signing a contract that lasts two years and four months, the union's Chrysler contract will expire on Sept. 14, 1990, the same date as the Ford and GM contracts. Since Chrysler's brush with bankruptcy forced union concessions in 1979, this will be the first time all union members at the Big Three will be covered by contracts that not only end at the same time, but have similar provisions.    Both sides said they hoped the agreement would provide a foundation for more smooth relations in coming months. The talks were started early to ease tensions that surfaced earlier this year by Chrysler's announced plans to close its Kenosha, Wis., assembly plant, and by failed plans to sell its parts operations. The talks themselves were marred by controversy over the size of the company's executive bonuses and a decision, latter scrapped, to move some work to Mexico.    But Mr. St. John said the media had exaggerated &quot;some rough spots in our relationship,&quot; and added, &quot;our relations are very positive.&quot; Mr. Bieber said the talks concluded &quot;with good spirit, good feeling.&quot;    The current contract doesn't expire until Sept. 14, and negotiations normally wouldn't have started until late July. But instead the talks started April 18, and were completed, after a final 36-hour session at company headquarters here, in less than three weeks.    The UAW's top priority in recent contract talks has been job security, and the Chrysler contract's centerpiece is a program modeled after those set up last year at the other auto makers.    It sets fixed employment levels at each site that can only be reduced by half the level of any attrition. It bans plant closings other than those already announced. It requires any company buying Chrysler plants to uphold the UAW contract. It toughens restrictions on transfering work to other companies. It protects workers from being laid off for reasons other than a decline in sales. It improves pension payments and replenishes unemployment-benefit funds.    The contract provides for no base wage increases, but does give workers lump sums in the last two years equal to 3% of their base wage. The average Chrysler assembly-line worker currently makes $14.43 an hour. Workers will also get profit-sharing payments under the same formulas in effect at Ford and GM.    Chrysler, unlike the other two auto makers, has a large number of unionized salaried workers as well. Those 6,000 will get the same economic and job-security programs. The auto maker also agreed to recognize the union for salaried employees at its new Technology Center in Auburn Hills, Mich. </TEXT></DOC>
