The first part of thiswork concerns the resonant reaction rate calculation method implementedin the APOLLO code, the so-called LIVOLANT and JEANPIERRE formalism.The errors introduced by the corresponding assumptions are quantifiedand we propose substitution methods which avoid large biases and supplysatisfactory results. The second part is dedicated to the cross-sectionevaluation of uranium major isotopes and to the achievement of APOLLOmultigroup cross-sections. This cross-section set takes into considerationson the one hand the recent differential information and the other handthe various integral information obtained in the French Atomic EnergyCommission facilities. The nuclear data file (JEF abd ENDF/B5) processing,for multigroup and self-shielded cross-sections achieving enable us tocheck the new THEMIS computer code. In the last part, the experimentalvalidation of the proposed procedure (accurate formalism mutuel shieldingand new multigroup library) is presented. This qualification is basedon the reinterpretation of critical experiments performed in the EOLEreactor at Cadarache and spent fuel analysis. The corresponding resultsdemonstrate that our propositions provide improvements on the computationof the PWR neutronic parameters; calculation-experiment discrepanciesare now consistent with experimental uncertainty margins. 46 refs; 31figs; 23 tabl.</TEXT></DOC>
