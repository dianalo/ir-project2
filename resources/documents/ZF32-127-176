 Clearly, Lotus had to reassure everyone -- itscustomers, its dealers, its key people and the US stock analysts whoeffectively decide the company's share price.andP;  &quot;Let's just say we backed thewrong horse,&quot; said Manzi, of the company's ill-judged commitment to OS/2 thatproduced 1-2-3/G, before adding: &quot;It's the best product of its type.andP;  Butthat decision is history now.&quot;andM;The history actually goes a little further back than the 1-2-3/G announcementin spring 1990.andP;  Five years ago Microsoft put out a press release which,among other enthusiasms, nominated Lotus as agreeing to develop products forthe then-new Windows 1.0.andP;  So did Lotus abrogate that contract?andP;  And whyhasn't Lotus been a long-term player in the Windows game?andM;In Boston last week, Manzi described the 1986 deal as a &quot;one-page PRendorsement&quot; connected with Microsoft's going public and offered the(perfectly valid) excuse that &quot;prior to Windows 3.0 there were some problemswith Windows as a development environment&quot;.andP;  It's a shame that first, Lotushadn't spotted those problems at the time and, second, that it didn't spotthe new improved problem-free Windows 3.0 a bit sooner.andM;Consigning yesterday's misjudgments to the historical trashcan was one of thefunctions for the expensive get-together in Boston's Back Bay.andP;  We were beinginvited to forget -- to accept that Lotus had learned valuable lessons fromthe 1-2-3/G exercise (and indeed some of 1-2-3/G's technology appears in thenew products for Windows and the Macintosh); to put aside embarrassingmemories of the prolonged and painful gestation of 1-2-3 Release 3; and tobelieve that, while Lotus might be a late arrival at the Windows party, itstill intends to be the loudest voice in Auld Lang Syne and leading the congaat dawn.andM;The audience at the Hynes Veterans Convention Centre lapped it up, breakinginto apparently spontaneous applause when the much-vaunted Macintosh andWindows versions of 1-2-3 were unveiled.andP;  It was partly an expression ofrelief and perhaps of gratitude too; this was an audience of the committed,and no one there wanted to see the worldwide investment in 1-2-3 dissipatedby product failures and corporate miscalculation.andM;To that extent, the ploy worked -- the Windows products look good, 1-2-3 forMacintosh will probably become the spreadsheet benchmark in the Apple worldand a bunch of autumn announcements will undoubtedly do wonders for fourthquarter revenue.andP;  When asked what he considered the most important feature of1-2-3 for Windows, the US product manager responsible for it replied tersely,&quot;its availability&quot;.andM;More important, though, was the statement of direction.andP;  In common with everyother bigname software vendor, and indeed with every purchaser of a decentsize, Lotus sees a multiple-platform future -- perm any from PCs,Macintoshes, Unix systems and mainframes -- with a requirement for screendisplays, data files, functions, procedures, training and support that arecompatible between systems.andM;So it makes sense for Lotus to build products that effectively work innear-identical fashion in different environments.andP;  1-2-3 for Windows and theMacintosh are important products and will generate important revenue.andP;  Therewill be a 1-2-3 Release 2.4 and a new version of 3.1.andP;  Improv, the NeXT-onlyproduct that Manzi summarised as &quot;reinventing the spreadsheet&quot;, will appearon other platforms -- probably for Presentation Manager and possibly forWindows -- &quot;as fast as we can do it...andP;  This has a very high priority.&quot;andM;But the key element in Lotus' strategy is not 1-2-3 or Freelance.andP;  Manzi putit in a nutshell: &quot;We are going as fast as we can to build a business aroundLotus Notes and CC:Mail.andP;  There is much emphasis on growing that businesswhile we still have a competitive advantage.&quot;andM;In short, &quot;Notes is a big piece of our future.&quot;andP;  How big a piece?andP;  &quot;Notes iswhat 1-2-3 was.&quot;andP;  This means that Lotus was the 1-2-3 company and now itintends to be the Notes company.andP;  It has six years of increasingly expensiveinvestment in Notes, and while Manzi hasn't banked the company on groupware,the continuing flow of cash generated by 1-2-3 is funding an interestingfuture.andM;Lotus UK managing director Paul Bailey said: &quot;Notes is difficult to describe,but once we get in the door it is easy to sell.&quot;andP;  Manzi refers to the 'sharedworkspace' and says groupware is (or should be) central to the wayorganisations work -- &quot;we need to make technology supportive of the task andnot intrusive; to make technology support the normal process of work andfacilitate the ability of people to work together in new ways.&quot;andM;Notes is an environment in which applications and tasks can genuinely beshared.andP;  Product development includes a Unix server and a Macintosh client;as Manzi put it: &quot;It is absolutely essential with a groupware product toembrace the mixed environment; Mac Notes client is the highest prioritydevelopment right now for us.&quot;andP;  Also coming is a &quot;group-enabled spreadsheet&quot;,a project called Chronicle that Manzi describes as permitting several peopleto work on the same product -- &quot;and it's conceivable that we will havesimilar Notes applications for word processing and other areas.&quot;andM;Jim Manzi is cool, calm and very collected.andP;  He has created a company thatfits his own image -- no tantrums, a clear sense of direction, and a verystrong sense of self-belief.andP;  Lets hope users don't misconstrue it asconceit.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
