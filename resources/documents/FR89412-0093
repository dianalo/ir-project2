The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application foramendment dated August 30, 1988, as supplemented by letters dated November18 (2 letters) and December 28, 1988, and February 7, 10 and 15, 1989.The Need for the Proposed Action The proposed change to the TS is required in order to provide greater operationalflexibility to reduce the frequency of unnecessary feedwater-related reactortrips. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision toTS and concludes that the proposed changes will result in a significantdecrease in the frequency of unnecessary feedwater-related reactor tripsand, at the same time, ensure adequate protection during normal and accidentconditions. Therefore, the proposed changes do not increase the probabilityor consequences of accidents, no changes are being made in the types ofany effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significantincrease in the allowable individual or cumulative occupational radiationexposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed actionwould result in no significant radiological environmental impact. The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forPrior Hearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 13, 1988 (53 FR 40148). No requestfor hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following thisnotice. With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed change tothe TS involves systems located within the restricted area as defined by10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents andhas no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludesthat there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associatedwith the proposed amendment. Alternatives to the Proposed Action Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would resultin reduced operational flexibility. Alternative Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Satement for the Callaway Plant dated January1982. Agencies and Persons Consulted The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult otheragencies or persons. Finding of No Significant Impact The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.
