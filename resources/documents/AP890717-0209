(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   About 2,000 Georgia-Pacific plywood workersreturned to work today after a week-long strike ended withratification of a new contract, a company spokesman said.   ``The picket lines went down in Arkansas on Sunday afternoon, andthe rest in Mississippi were down by late evening,''Georgia-Pacific's Terry Hadaway said. ``We do have a ratification ofthe contract by all of the locations involved.''   In Arkansas, boilers at plywood plants in Crossett and Fordycewere re-started early today, and workers returned for shifts at 6a.m. and 7 a.m., Hadaway said.   About 1,000 workers were on strike in Arkansas and an equalnumber walked out at G-P plants in Louisville, Taylorsville, andGloster, Miss., Hadaway said.   Plants at all five cities should be back in full productionwithin a couple of days, the spokesman said.   The strike began last Monday. It idled most operations at theArkansas and Mississippi plants, although processing of green veneercontinued under supervision of management employees, Hadaway said.The plants would have routinely been closed on Saturday and Sunday,meaning five days of production were affected.   ``Our goal was to get people back to work as quickly as possible.With the union's help, we accomplished that,'' Hadaway said.   Union officials and Hadaway said strikers approved a new contractproposal in voting Sunday. The four-year contract calls for payincreases of 3 percent each year and allows for one-time bonuses tosome workers who are losing time-and-a-half pay on Sunday.   The original offer called for a 2 percent increase the first,second and fourth years of the contract and a 3 percent hike only inthe third year.   The pay hikes are retroactive to June 1.   Workers on the second and third shifts will get 208 times theirclassified hourly pay rate and boiler, maintenance and electricaldepartment workers will get bonuses equal to 104 times theirclassified hourly rates, officials said.   The old contract expired June 1, but negotiators continued talksfor more than a month until they broke off July 7. Georgia-Pacificrepresentatives made the company's latest offer during two days ofnegotiations with union representative last week at Vicksburg, Miss.   Some union members, however, were disappointed.   ``We're getting less now than we were in 1985 and 1986,'' saidEloise Harris, who works in the gluing department. ``I think itshould have been more.''   The loss of Sunday premium pay upset Lloyd Williams, vicepresident of the Crossett union.   ``It means a big loss to me in wages,'' Williams said. ``It's abig loss to me and my family and a big gain for them (the company).The bonus won't make up for it.''   When the strike began, Hadaway said the company would shut down,at least temporarily, the plants which manufacture southern pineplywood for residential and commercial construction.   Before the contract, the minimum hourly pay at the plant was$7.90.</TEXT></DOC>
