These amendmentsinclude delegation of authority to the General Counsel to designate certainlegal opinions involving veterans' benefits under laws administered bythe VA as precedential. The amendments also authorize the General Counselto issue legal opinions involving veterans' benefits under laws administeredby the VA which are binding on Agency officials with respect to the matterat issue, but not precedential. Opinions of this type which are designatedas ``advisory only'' will not have such binding effect. The regulatoryaction is intended to assist VA officials, benefit claimants and claimants'representatives by defining the status and effect of particular classesof General Counsel opinions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> These rules are effective March 8, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Andrew J. Mullen, Deputy AssistantGeneral Counsel, Office of the General Counsel, Veterans Administration,810 Vermont Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20420 (202) 233-2440.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> On March 15, 1988, the VA publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 8471) a notice proposing amendment ofParts 2, 3, and 14 of Title 38, Code of Federal Regulations, to definethe status and effect of certain legal opinions of the General Counsel.The VA proposed adding a specific delegation of authority in Part 2 ofTitle 38 under which the General Counsel would be authorized to designate,in accordance with standards established in an amended andSection; 14.507(b),certain legal opinions as having precedential effect in Agency adjudicationsand appellate reviews of benefit claims under laws administered by theVA. The Agency also proposed amendment of andSection; 14.507 to provide thata written legal opinion of the General Counsel, as defined in a new paragraph(c) of that section, would be conclusive as to all Agency officials andemployees with respect to the matter at issue unless designated ``advisoryonly'' or superseded by a change in statute or regulation or by a subsequentopinion. Finally, the VA proposed modification of andSection; 3.101, governingadjudications, to recognize the General Counsel's authority to issue precedentopinions. Interested persons were given until April 14, 1988, to submitwritten comments, suggestions, or objections concerning the proposed regulatoryaction. The VA received three comments on the proposed rules, two from congressionalsources and one from a veterans' service organization. The comments werein general agreement as to the need to clarify the status and effect ofGeneral Counsel opinions and offered several suggestions for changes inthe proposed amendments. Two commenters asserted that the VA is required by the Freedom of InformationAct, 5 U.S.C. 552, to publish all precedent opinions of the General Counselin the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> Section 522(a)(1)(D) of Title 5, United StatesCode, provides for publication in the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> for the guidance of the public, of ``interpretationsof general applicability formulated and adopted by the agency.'' Underthe terms of section 552(a)(1), a person may not be required to resortto or be adversely affected by matter required to be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and not so published, except to the extent theperson has actual and timely notice of its contents. The VA concludes that opinions designated as precedential pursuant to new38 CFR 14.507(b) will fall within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1) and besubject to its terms concerning publication and actual notice. New 38 CFR14.507(b) has thus been modified to recognize the applicability of 5 U.S.C.552(a)(1) to opinions designated as ``precedent opinions'' pursuant tothat regulation, and such opinions will be treated by the Agency in accordancewith the referenced statute. Another commenter asserted that the Freedom of Information Act requiresmaintenance by the VA of an index of General Counsel opinions. This commenterexpressed the view that such an index should include all opinions of theGeneral Counsel and the VA District Counsels, regardless of precedentialeffect, and all past, as well as future, opinions. This commenter alsosuggested that the index be made available for sale and be made availablefor inspection at all VA stations. Section 552(a)(2) of Title 5, United States Code, provides for indexingof ``interpretations which have been adopted by the agency and are notpublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.'' Interpretations within the scope of section552(a)(2) may be relied on or used by an agency against an individual onlyif the interpretation has been duly indexed and made available or publishedor the individual has actual and timely notice of its terms. The VA concludesthat written legal opinions of the General Counsel which are conclusiveas to all Agency officials and employees pursuant to new 38 CFR 14.507(a)and which are not published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> will fall within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)and be subject to its terms concerning indexing and actual notice. New38 CFR 14.507(a) has thus been modified to recognize the applicabilityof 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) to opinions to be accorded conclusive effect pursuantto that regulation, and such opinions will be treated by the Agency inaccordance with the referenced statute. The index to be maintained pursuantto 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) will be made available to the public in accordancewith applicable legal requirements. The VA does not consider legal opinions which are advisory only to be interpretationsadopted by the Agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(1)(D) or (a)(2)(B)and thus does not consider them subject to the publication requirementsof section 552(a)(1) or the indexing provisions of section 552(a)(2). Opinionsissued by the VA District Counsels, since not accorded conclusive effectunder 38 CFR 14.507(a), are considered advisory only and not subject to5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(1) or (a)(2). Further, because VA statutes and regulationsdid not previously give precedential or conclusive effect to General Counselopinions not adopted or approved by the Administrator of Veterans Affairs,the VA does not consider General Counsel opinions issued prior to promulgationof new 38 CFR 14.507 and not adopted or approved by the Administrator tobe subject to section 552 (a)(1) or (a)(2) requirements. The Administrator of Veterans Affairs has long since discontinued the practicesof approving and adopting as Administrator's Decisions legal opinions preparedby the General Counsel and of issuing ``instructions'' for the implementationof statutes. Although such documents are largely of historical interestat this time, Board of Veterans Appeals regulations continue to containa provision binding the Board to follow decisions and instructions of theAdministrator in its consideration of appeals. A similar antiquated referenceto Administrator's Decisions and opinions approved by the Administratorand to defined policies as enunciated by the Administrator also appearsin Agency adjudication regulations. In order to update the regulationsand simplify the classification system for legal opinions, the Agency isamending 38 CFR 3.101 and 19.103 to delete reference to Administrator'sDecisions, opinions approved by the Administrator, and instructions andenunciated policies of the Administrator. Pursuant to this change, suchdecisions, opinions, instructions, and policy statements will be withoutprecedential or conclusive effect in future Agency adjudications. It is not the VA's intention through these amendments to effect a changein legal principles currently governing claim adjudication. The VA believesthat generally legal principles enunciated in Administrator's Decisionsaffecting benefits have long since been adopted in regulations or are nolonger applicable due to amendment or repeal of the statutory provisionsto which they pertained. Should a claim arise in which an Administrator'sDecision would have been dispositive of a legal issue but for these regulatoryamendments, the Agency intends to apply the legal interpretation enunciatedin such decision. Accordingly, the General Counsel may, on a case-by-casebasis, reissue, under the terms of new andSection; 14.507, opinions formerlyadopted as Administrator's Decisions. Any opinion so reissued will havethe same effect as a written legal opinion newly issued under that section.One commenter expressed the view that the proposed amendments would perpetuatewhat it perceives as a confusing variety of opinions on legal issues. TheVA feels that the amendments will reduce any potential for confusion byestablishing three classes of opinions involving benefits, i.e., precedentopinions, conclusive opinions without precedential effect, and opinionswhich are advisory only. However, for purposes of consistency, in orderto further clarify the application of the regulations, and to eliminateuse of terms such as ``adjudication'' and ``appellate review'', which wereapparently considered confusing by this commenter, the VA has modifiednew 38 CFR 2.6(e)(9) and 14.507 to better define the types of opinionsto which these sections apply. Under these provisions as modified, the General Counsel may designate asprecedential and give binding effect to a written legal opinion ``involvingveterans' benefits under laws administered by the Veterans Administration.''This terminology is intended to parallel the jurisdiction of the Boardof Veterans Appeals as defined in 38 CFR 19.1 through 19.3. Thus, the termis intended to include not only claims for monetary benefits but also waiverclaims and other administrative debt collection matters, determinationsof eligibility for a variety of services, devices and equipment, and othermatters relating to benefits. In keeping with legislative development ofstatutes relating to judicial review of VA decisions and attorney feesfor representation in benefit matters, the word ``claim'' has been deletedfrom the regulations to further clarify that matters other than affirmativeclaims for benefits are included within the scope of the regulation. Theterm ``veterans' benefits'' is intended to include benefits provided toveterans, their dependents, and their surviviors. Also, to improve clarityand more specifically define its scope, revised 38 CFR 14.507 has beenmodified to limit the authority granted therein to the General Counseland the Deputy General Counsel acting as or for the General Counsel. One commenter expressed the view that any opinion meeting the criteriaset forth in proposed 38 CFR 14.507(b) should be designated as precedentialand the General Counsel should not have discretion in making the designation.However, the VA believes there are likely to be situations where designationof an opinion as precedential may not be desirable even though it meetsthe criteria provided in the regulation. Such situations may arise, forexample, where an opinion involves a rapidly developing area of the lawor when a major judicial opinion on a issue is expected in the foreseeablefuture. The VA therefore concludes that the General Counsel should retaindiscretion as to which opinions meeting the criteria of andSection; 14.507should be designated precedent opinions. One commenter, noting that under proposed 38 CFR 14.507(a) advice, recommendations,or conclusions on matters of Government or Agency policy contained withinan otherwise conculsive written legal opinion shall not be considered bindingon Agency officials, suggested that format for opinions be employed todifferentiate which portions of an opinion are deemed binding. The criticaldistinction in assessing the conclusive effect of statements in a writtenlegal opinion is whether the statements address policy matters or interpretthe law. The VA feels that in most cases this distinction will be readilyapparent from the text of the opinion. In those rare instances where questionsmay arise, the General Counsel may provide clarification upon request.Section 14.507(b) of the proposed rules provided that all precedent opinionswould be entered in the Office of the General Counsel's computer data base.One commenter suggested that the VA clarify its policy regarding publicaccess to this computer data base. Another commenter pointed out the difficultyservice organization representatives and members of the public may havein accessing and using this data base and urged that adequate means beemployed to make General Counsel opinions available to the public. The VA believes that recognition of the applicability of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1) and (2) to particular classes of General Counsel opinions imposes onthe Agency an obligation to make such opinions available to the publicaccordance with the statutory terms. Difficulties with public access tothe Agency's current computer system have been noted. Given the changingnature of the VA's information management capabilities, the Agency considersit prudent at this time to maintain flexibility as to the means by whichthe public availability requirements of the Freedom of Information Actwill be addressed. Accordingly, while the VA maintains its commitment topublic availability of opinions in accordance with law, references to publicavailability and to the General Counsel's computer data base have beendeleted from new 38 CFR 14.507(b).The VA notes that, in adopting this regulation, it does not intend to waiveits authority under applicable law to withhold from public disclosure particularopinions designated as ``advisory only'' pursuant to new 38 CFR 14.507.The VA does intend, however, to make such opinions available to the publicto the fullest extent compatible with the General Counsel's responsibilityas legal counsel to the Agency. Finally, one commenter contended that due process requires a claimant beprovided a copy of a legal opinion affecting his or her claim and an opportunityto rebut that opinion prior to the Agency's reliance on the opinion indetermination of the claim. This commenter also contended that the claimantshould be given notice when a request for opinion is made and should beinformed of those portions of the opinion upon which the decisionmakerrelies. To the extent that this comment suggests the existence of a right on thepart of a claimant to participate in the development of a legal opinionaffecting his or her claim, the commenter cited no authority for this proposition,and the VA is aware of none. Such participation would be inappropriatein light of the Agency's special expertise in interpreting its own statutesand regulations. Further, since decisionmakers would not be free to disregardconclusive opinions issued pursuant to 38 CFR 14.507(a), the correctnessof such an interpretation would not be an issue at a hearing on the subjectclaim and the extent of reliance by the decisionmaker would not be in doubt.Apart from due process considerations, however, the VA plans to reviewits procedures to assure adequate notice of controlling General Counselopinions to assist claimants in the appeal and judicial-review processes.In light of the foregoing, the subject regulatory proposal is amended asnoted above, and the rules as so amended are adopted as final rules asset forth below. The Administrator hereby certifies that these regulatory amendments willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.601-612. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these regulatory amendments are thereforeexempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analyses requirementof sections 603 and 604. The reason for this certification is that regulatoryamendments will have only a limited, beneficial effect on claimants andtheir representatives. These regulatory amendments have been reviewed under E.O. 12291 and havebeen determined to be non-major because they will not have any adverseeconomic impact on or increase costs to consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, and local government agencies, or geographic regions.
