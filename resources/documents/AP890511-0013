The non-profit Triangle Coalition for Science and TechnologyEducation also said the federal government should spend an extra$304 million in fiscal 1990, rising to $465 million in 1993, topromote elementary science, math and technology educationimprovements.   The proposed presidential task force would develop a nationalpolicy, coordinate federal programs and plan a White Houseconference on ``Science, Mathematics and Technology Education forthe year 2000.''   ``We have made a special effort to emphasize programs that donot require significant new funds,'' said the report released bythe coalition of 80 business, labor, science and education groups.``However, the very magnitude of the challenge the nation faceswill call for some new programs and new resources.''   The action plan, designed to help Congress and the presidentdevelop a national policy on science education, states that``increased investments in elementary education must be thenation's number one priority.''   Specifically, it suggests that the government start a $50million grant program to help elementary schools pay for newscience equipment and earmark another $50 million to encourageinnovative approaches to science teaching.   The group would also give the National Science Foundation anextra $50 million to expand its in-service and pre-service trainingprograms for elementary teachers.   Other recommendations would require less money or none at all.Among them:   _Revamp the science curriculum to tailor it to students ofdifferent ages, interests and backgrounds, a project that should beled by the National Science Foundation.   _Increase federal support for graduate training in the sciencesand engineering, with special support to women and minorities.   _Give clear instructions to schools receiving money underfederal school improvement programs, totaling more than $1 billiona year, that their first priority must be science, math andtechnology education activities.   _Reserve 5 percent of the nearly $9 billion the federalgovernment spends on student loans, grants and scholarships forspecial programs aimed at attracting and retaining math, scienceand technology teachers at all academic levels.   _Establish new federal incentives to encourage better teachertraining.   _Implement more stringent state requirements for scienceteachers.   _Offer salary incentives for excellence in science and mathteaching and strengthened continuing education requirements in thescience area for elementary and secondary teachers.   The Triangle proposals are a follow-up to an earlier report thatcalled for a sharply focused science education strategy.   The group is affiliated with the National Science TeachersAssociation. Organizations represented by its officers include theNational Education Association, the American Federation ofTeachers, E.I. Du Pont, Amoco Corp., the United Auto Workers Union,the Acoustical Society of America, General Electric Co., the EdisonElectric Institute, the American Chemical Society and variousuniversities and state education groups.</TEXT></DOC>
