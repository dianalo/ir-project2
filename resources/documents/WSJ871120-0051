The owner and operator of 7-Eleven stores has agreed to be taken private in a buy-out led by Thompson Co., which is run by Southland's top two executives and their brother. However, Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc., a unit of Salomon Inc., haven't been able to complete a $1.5 billion subordinated debt needed to complete the transaction.    The special meeting was set for shareholders to approve the second step of the acquisition, in which each remaining share would be exchanged for $61.32 in cash and 0.6672 shares of a new $25 junior preferred stock. The Thompson brothers, sons of the company's founder, own more than 70% of Southland's stock outstanding.    A company spokeswoman said Southland is continuing to try to get the needed financing arranged so the transaction can be completed.    In a leveraged buy-out a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Southland closed at $58.375 a share, up $1.25. </TEXT></DOC>
