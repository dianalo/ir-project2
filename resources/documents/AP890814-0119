(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Columbia sustained onlyminor damage to its heat-shield tiles during its first flight in 3{years and had slight equipment problems during the secret militarymission, NASA said Monday.   A steering thruster failed and the pilot's seat suddenly jerkedbackward during launch, but none of the problems is consideredserious, said a National Aeronautics and Space Administrationspokeswoman.   Columbia ``looks absolutely beautiful'' after its five-day,one-hour classified mission, said Ann Montgomery, in charge ofprocessing the shuttle.   Columbia landed at this Mojave Desert military base Sundaymorning after its mission to deploy a satellite, which experts havesaid is a modified KH-12 spy satellite designed to photographmilitary targets. The astronauts also reportedly performedexperiments related to the ``Star Wars'' anti-missile defense system.   ``It was a very clean flight, so we didn't have a lot ofproblems,'' Montgomery said.   She said Columbia probably will leave here Saturday for a two-daypiggyback flight back to Cape Canaveral, Fla., atop a modifiedBoeing 747 jetliner.   When Columbia was launched from Florida last Tuesday, pilotRichard Richards' seat jerked backward about one inch, but themalfunction caused no problems, Montgomery said.   ``It was exciting when it happened,'' but Richards used a motorcontrol to move the seat forward to its normal position ``and itstayed,'' she added.   The shuttle's commander and pilot actually do very little duringthe spacecraft's liftoff, which is almost entirely controlled bycomputers.   A leaky in-flight steering thruster will need replacing, butColumbia's crew shut it down during the flight and used otherthrusters, Montgomery said.   Only three of the shuttle's roughly 30,000 heat-shielding tileswere damaged enough to require replacement, based on initialinspection, she said. A more detailed inspection was underway Monday.   Two of the tiles are on the bottom of the orbiter and may havebeen gouged when yet-unidentified debris fell from the shuttle whenit was launched, she added. The third damaged tile, which waschipped, is located on the main landing gear door.   Montgomery said workers will examine about 20 other minorpotential problems that developed just before or during Columbia'sflight, including some instrument glitches and failure of a thrusterheater and a nozzle that dumps water from the orbiter.   Columbia's brakes and landing gear were in such good shape thatthey didn't need to be removed before the shuttle was towed off thehard clay runway on which it landed _ only the second time that hashappened, she said.   Montgomery said she didn't know why Columbia appeared dirty, butindicated the discolorations were heat streaks caused duringre-entry.   Columbia's mission brought the shuttle fleet back up to threeorbiters. Columbia is the oldest. It last flew in January 1986,landing 10 days before Challenger exploded after liftoff, killingseven crew members. After the accident NASA concentrated on makingsafety modifications to the two newer shuttles, Discovery andAtlantis, before refurbishing Columbia.   Columbia is scheduled to be launched again Dec. 18 to deploy aNavy communications satellite and retrieve a bus-sized scientificsatellite that will fall to Earth within several months if notplucked from its decaying orbit.   The next shuttle flight is scheduled for Oct. 12, when Atlantiswill carry the Galileo space probe into Earth orbit so it can belaunched on a six-year voyage to Jupiter.</TEXT></DOC>
