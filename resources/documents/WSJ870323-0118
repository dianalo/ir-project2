William Degler   Chicago   ---   As an Atlanta native, recently exiled to Chicago, I could not help but wonder at your qualifications for judging barbecue. While you ferreted out such political hot spots as Manuel's Tavern (in the finest journalistic tradition), it boggles the mind that you missed the famous second state capital: Harold's Barbecue at 171 McDonough Blvd. in Southeast Atlanta. Or Sprayberry's Barbecue in Newman, 30 miles south of Atlanta off Highway I85. While, as you note, the taxi problem deserves immediate attention, Atlantans do tend to take barbecue more seriously, and we rate our native recipes over those of other, less refined, Southern states.
