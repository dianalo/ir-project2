New oil and gas discoveries have dwindled because of highexploration costs, but there are plenty of reserves for sale.   ``There are more reserves on the market now than there have everbeen,'' said Houston consultant Bill Strevig. ``As an informedguess, I'd say there is double what there was a year or two ago.''   Strevig He calculated Saturday that reserves worth an estimated$2.3 billion changed hands during the second quarter and he expectsa barrage of sales before 1988 is over.   Tenneco Inc. and Texaco Inc. have the largest blocks ofproperties on the market, with a combined price tag that analystssay is in the neighborhood of $6 billion. Analysts estimate thatdozens of other companies have properties worth an additional $1.5billion on the market.   Consultants, analysts and the companies that are gobbling up thereserves say current prices range from $5 to $5.50 a barrel for oiland 80 cents to $1 per thousand cubic feet for natural gas,although some buyers recently have paid more.   The industry historically has valued reserves at about one-thirdthe price at the wellhead, so with West Texas Intermediate crudeselling at a little over $15 a barrel the market prices of $5 and$5.50 are on target if oil and gas prices remain flat in the nextfew years, Strevig said.   According to a recent study by the accounting and consultingfirm Arthur Andersen andamp; Co., the cost of drilling new wells is inthe range of $6 to $8 a barrel, so it is cheaper and less risky tobuy oil that already has been drilled.   Industry experts give several reasons for selling reserves, butthe one most often cited is the seller's need to reduce debt.   ``They look at their assets and say to themselves, `What do wewant to sell?''' said Clyde Buck, senior vice president withRauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc.   ``Then they ask, `What can we get for this assets today, versusthree to five years from now?'''   For years, companies generally had held on to their reserves,thinking the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countrieseventually would succeed in driving up world energy prices, andthus the value of their properties.   ``The price of oil could go up dramatically, but gee whiz, itjust doesn't look like there's a high probability of that,'' Bucksaid. So companies are dumping properties and putting the proceedsinto debt reduction programs and into other business sectors theybelieve have more potential, he said.   Energy companies are not the only ones buying reserves. BillPadek of Geodyne Resources in Tulsa, Okla., said that incomepartnership funds like his, and other institutional investors suchas insurance companies and pension funds have been buying reserves.   Energy reserve investments are suited to those organizations, hesaid, because current prices are relatively low and pension fundscan afford to hold an investment with a 10- to 20-year scope.</TEXT></DOC>
