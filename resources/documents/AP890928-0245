Bilzerianreceived the stiffest sentence yet in the government's three-yearcorruption probe but a federal judge said it won't necessarilydeter other financial crimes.   ``I have been around the criminal justice system for 40 years,''U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward said Wednesday before sentencingBilzerian to four years in jail and a $1.5 million fine.   ``When I began my experience there were wheeler-dealers,'' hesaid. ``As I sit here today I am fairly certain there iswheeler-dealering going on within five miles of this building.''   Bilzerian, a high-school dropout and Vietnam veteran who cappeda meteoric business career with the $1.06 billion takeover ofSinger Co., was convicted June 9 on nine counts of securitiesfraud, conspiracy to commit tax fraud and making false statementsto the government.   He also was sentenced to two years probation and 250 hours ofcommunity service for a pattern of lawbreaking in three failedtakeovers and another stock deal in 1985 and 1986 that netted himmore than $12 million.   Bilzerian had faced a maximum 45 years in prison and $2.25million in fines. Still, his sentence was the longest to date incases derived from the confessions of jailed stock speculator IvanBoesky, who is serving a three-year term.   ``The lure of money has caused him _ an intelligent young man _to lose what I perceive to be proper perspective,'' Ward said. ``Inshort, he lies.''   The charges involved raids on apparel maker Cluett, Peabody andamp;Co., building supplies maker H.H. Robertson andamp; Co. and HammermillPaper Co., and another transaction of Armco Inc. stock.   Bilzerian plans to appeal, said his attorney, Arthur F. Mathews.   ``My trial and conviction has publicly humiliated me and I amsorry for any sorrow and shame I have caused my family andfriends,'' Bilzerian stated in a pre-sentencing letter to Ward. ``Iwish I could turn back the clock of time and correct whatevermistakes I may have made.''   Bilzerian was freed on bail pending appeal but Ward orderedBilzerian, who in July reported a net worth of $81.4 million, topay the fines within 30 days.   None of the charges against Bilzerian involved his 1988 takeoverof Singer, the sewing-machine maker turned defense contractor.   The Bilzerian conviction was the first jury verdict in thegovernment's continuing white-collar corruption probe, which beganwith the May 1986 arrest of former trader Dennis Levine, who ledinvestigators to Boesky.   Bilzerian was convicted of submitting false documents to theSecurities and Exchange Commission, filing false tax returns andrigging transactions to skirt federal tax and disclosure laws intandem with Los Angeles stockbroker Boyd L. Jefferies, whotestified against Bilzerian.   Jefferies, who testified against Bilzerian, recently received asuspended sentence. Sentencing is pending for others, including sixformer Princeton-Newport Partners LP defendants found guilty offraud and racketeering and former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.managing director Martin A. Siegel.   Bilzerian, who resigned as Singer chairman in June, still facescivil securities charges filed by the SEC seeking $31.3 million inalleged illegal profits.   Assistant U.S. Attorney David Brodsky cited Bilzerian's alleged``arrogance and utter disregard for the law,'' said Bilzeriancommitted perjury during the trial and said a lengthy prison termwould deter similar behavior on Wall Street.   The case was the first criminal trial of illegal stock``parking,'' in which securities ownership is disguised to dodgefederal tax or disclosure laws.   ``Over an 18-month period Bilzerian committed serious securitiescrimes over and over again,'' Brodsky said.   Mathews sought a suspended sentence on the grounds thatBilzerian was a first-time offender, that his prosecution was a``novelty,'' that his crimes had no identifiable victims and thatdeterrence had been achieved.</TEXT></DOC>
