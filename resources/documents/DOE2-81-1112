The influence of the following parameters: the flow rateof benzene, irradiation dose, concentration of chlorine in benzene, temperatureand the dose rate on the rate of reaction and the composition of theobtained product was determined. Comparative experiments with the solvents:dichloromethane and tetrachloroethane were also carried out. A possibilityof the industrial application of the method is discussed. 6 refs., 2figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
