(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>With flexible configuration, the Synchronous Optical Network standard willlet users tailor transmissions to the bandwidth they need and developinnovative services such as video conferencing.andM;Telecommunications network users are hardened to the realities of proprietaryproducts and limited service offerings:  Until recently, there was littlereason to believe that the computer industry trend toward standardization andinterchangeable products would spread to telecommunications.andM;Now is managers concerned about the reliability and cost of a telecom networkare pinning their hopes on the Synchronous Optical Network (Sonet)specification developed by the Exchange Carriers Standards Association's(ECSA) TI committee.andP;  Sonet is promising more than just standardization; itpromises a whole new class of high-bandwidth services destined to nurture newend-user applications.andP;  Taken together, its low error ratesgiga-bit-per-second speed and pay-only-for-what-you-need configuration are anattractive alternative to today's digital copper-based networks.andM;The first to benefit will be telephone companies, alternate carriers andoperators of private networks.andP;  Today most U.S.andP;  data communications demandis met by leased T-carrier lines connecting two locations full-time.andO;Compared with Sonet, T-carrier lines have significant limitations (see chart,&quot;Sonet Surpasses Digital Copper Lines&quot;).andM;On TI  facilities, digital signals transmit at 1.544 megabits per second, theequivalent of 24 voice-grade channels.andP;  T3 circuits, which transmit at44Mbps, are the fastest connection generally available on public networks.andM;Sonet transmission speeds start at the Optical Carrier-1  (OC-1) base levelof 51.840Mbps and rise in exact multiples of that amount to oc-256, which hasa transmission rate of 13.271 gigabits per second.andP;  Although Sonet isdesigned to be backwardly compatible with existing T-carrier and otherequipment, it offers its full range of communications support only at theoc-3 level (155.52Mbps) and beyond.andM;Highway to HeavenandM;One of Sonet's primary attractions is easy management of this gigabitbandwidth.andP;  Rodney Boehm, chairman of the ECSA's T1X1 subcommittee anddirector of technology planning at San Jose-based Fujitsu America Inc., amajor supplier of Sonet equipment says, &quot;Sonet is an infrastructure withinthe network that allows me to create high-bandwidth highways in a standardway.andP;  T3 is one kind of high-bandwidth highway.andP;  But Sonet allows me tocreate however large a highway I want to create.andP;  And I don't have torespecify or rebuild my network to allow this highway to carry traffic.&quot;andM;Today, trafficking in channel bandwidth beyond T3 offerings is &quot;sort of anunnatural act,&quot; in the words of Ned Farinholt, executive staff member at mciCommunication Corp.'s advanced technology group in Washington, D.C.andP;  Hepoints out that &quot;Sonet has that capability built into it, so you can take two50Mb channels and get a 100Mb channel, or three and get a 150Mb channel.andP;  &quot;andM;Improved reliability is another of Sonet's attractions.andP;  According to BarrettRobb, manager of transmission product planning for ATandamp;T's family of Sonetproducts,  Light-wave fiber-optic digital transport systems have been inexistence for 10 years, and users are now reaping the benefits of very lowbit-error rates and high reliability.&quot;andM;Several well-publicized network failures have made reliability a highpriority for telecommunications managers.andP;  And a fiber-optic network is morereliable than traditional facilities.andP;  Although co per networks offer biterror rates in the one in a million range, fiber weighs in at one in 10billion or better.andM;Sonet's ample embedded control channel provides the ability to trackend-to-end performance of every transmission and identify elements that causeerrors--an impossible feat with copper networks.andP;  With this feature, carrierscan guarantee transmission performance, and users can readily verifycompliance without resorting to network test equipment and offline testing.andO;For network managers, these capabilities will mean earlier identification ofproblems, and networks that are easier to maintain.andM;Traffic ControlandM;Network managers will also benefit from the improved traffic control thatSonet offers them.andP;  Deployed on digitally switched networks, Sonet supportsdynamic software control of triffic paths.andP;  In conjunction with Sonet'serror-monitoring capabilities, dynamic routing allows network managers todesign robust error-detecting networks.andP;  This provides the foundation forsoftware systems that route traffic around network failures.andP;  Several Sonetequipment manufacturers offer so-called  self-healing network products thatdo just that.andM;Because Sonet uses a hierarchical structure for its data payload, fractionalservices similar to currently available TI offerings are possible, but  withmuch less overhead and expense.andP;  And since Sonet networks rely onprogrammable digital multiplexers, end-user services can be provisionedremotely under software control, rather than manually.andP;  Manual provisioningby network services is slow; users have waited months to receive datacommunications services.andP;  With Sonet, they may find that they can have theservice in a week.andM;The combination of Sonet's fractional services and remote provisioning makesit possible for its networks to support on-demand access to variablebandwidths up to 2.488Gbps.andP;  Ray Ritchie, a division manager at BellCommunications Research Inc.andP;  (Bellcore) and manager of Bellcore's Sonetproject, says, &quot;I would expect to see a family of services that don't existtoday: dail-up bandwidth.&quot; Bellcore is the research arm of the seven regionalBell holding companies.andM;A good deal of this readily accessible bandwidth is expected to enhanceexisting applications.andP;  An expert opinion survey conducted by TechnologyFutures Inc. of Austin, Texas,  projects that by the year 2000 more than halfall U.S.andP;  businesses will use wide-band services for high-speed datacommunications and local area network interconnection.andM;The high cost of leased high-speed data communications has provided companieswith an incentive to distribute computing  power.andP;  But the advent of lessexpensive high-speed connections and more flexible, accessible fractionalservices may prompt many companies to reconsider that strategy.andP;  Some mayrecentralize their operations.andP;  Maryland Casualty Co., an insurance firmheadquartered in Baltimore, is an example.andM;As Charles Ferraro, vice president of telecommunications, explains: &quot;Untilmid-1989, Maryland Casualty was basically a regionally managed company.andP;  Wehad five regions throughtout the  U.S.andP;  to which smaller offices reported.andO;Fifty-six-kilobit circuits ran from our main  office to each of the fiveregions and from them, 9.6Kb circuits to about 80 offices throughout thecountry.andP;  Around the middle of 1989 we began reorganizing.andP;  The company stillhas 80 offices around the country; however, we do not have regional offices.andO;Everybody now reports directly to our home  Office'.andP;  &quot;andM;The network consists of a variety of ATandamp;T services, including twenty-three56Kb circuits coming into ATandamp;T's central office in Baltimore.andP;  MarylandCasualty also leases two 44Mb T3 circuits from Metropolitan Fiber SystemsInc. The T3 circuits connect the ATandamp;T facilities to Maryland and Casualty'sheadquarters.andM;Other organizations are looking to use their bandwidth to connect LANs.andP;  Froman application perspective, we see being able to tie our LANs into the widearea infrastructure [as enabling us to take] advantage of that bandwidth,&quot;says Robert Alley, product marketing manager for Hewlett-Packard Co.'sApplied Computerized Telephony products.andP;  &quot;That's going to facilitateapplications that really are new.andP;  A good example, and one we use within ourown company, is being able to have remotely distributed engineering teams.andP;  Ateam can be working on a sizable design and take that design and move itaround.andP;  What that requires is fairly broad bandwidth.andP;  But it's notdedicated bandwidth; it's only available when you want it.&quot;andM;Future DirectionsandM;In the future the wide bandwidth that the Sonet standard can provide willbecome increasingly important as new voice, graphics and video applicationsbecome more prevalent.andM;As HP's Alley says: &quot;Video is going to have a tremendous impact, once we haveSonet and ISDN [Integrated Services Digital Network]-type capabilitiesavailable and no longer need dedicated circuits for videoconferencing.andP;  Assoon as you are able to wheel in a videoconferencing unit and sit down in anoffice area and dial u somebody 3,000 miles away, [then] it's find of likevoice mail-everybody will begin using it.&quot;andM;Another likely beneficiary of Sonet is computer imaging, which is alreadytaxing LAN throughput in banks, insurance companies and othertransaction-oriented organizations.andP;  As these enterprises move to connecttheir separate facilities, this traffic will begin to flow through public andprivate broadband networks, taking advantage of the benefits Sonet standardsoffer.andM;Deborah Donovan, supervisor of data communications at Philadelphia-basedTowers Terrin, an international management consulting firm that generates asignificant amount of TI and international traffic, offers this observationabout Sonet and its related technologies: &quot;You can't afford to ignore them.andO;What we do today affects whether we can take advantage of these technologiestomorrow.andP;  No matter how fancy your tool is, if you can't deliver it atspeeds that are reasonable for productivity and that get the job done, thenyour tool is pretty much useless.&quot;andM;In short, an organization's communications requirements may well be affectedmore by widespread use of applications that require modest bandwidth than bymodest use of applications that require wide bandwidth.andP;  Scott Wallace is aWarwick, Mass.-based independent analyst and consultant in imagingtechnologies.andM;Who's Writing This Sonet?andM;The Sonet standard is the work of the Exchange Carriers StandardsAssociation's Tl committee, which was established in 1984 to coordinate thedevelopment of U.S.andP;  telecommunications standards.andP;  This committee isaccredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and the Sonetspecifications are fully compliant with the Consultative Committee onInternational Telephony and Telegraphy's (CCITT) Synchronous DigitalHierarchy recommendation;, making Sonet both a U.S.andP;  and an internationalstandard.andP;  The Sonet standard is being released in phases because of itsconsiderable scope and because of the high degree of intercorporatecollaboration involved in its development.andM;Rodney Boehm, chairman of the T1X1 subcommittee, which deals with digitalhierarchical structures and related technical parameters, describes the Sonetphases.andP;  &quot;Phase 1, issued in 1988, established the signal format and theoptical parameters for the interface, supporting reliable informationtransfer over the fiber.andP;  Phase 2, which clarifies several Phase 1specifications and specifies the protocols for the embedded operation andcontrol channels, is expected to be formally approved in October.andP;  Phase 3 isnot yet fully defined but will include parameters  defining the messages thatpass over the operations channels in support bf midspan meets.&quot;andM;Where two telecommunications carriers' systems join, a midspan meet is thepoint at which operations and control signals must be transferred from onesystem to another.andP;  Today, midspan meets are an engineering challenge thatrequires extended negotiation and technical support.andP;  Sonet will  allowcarriers to casually and routinely interconnect their systems Withoutsignificant engineering effort.andM;Phases 1 and 2 provide sufficient definition-of the Sonet interface to permitthe development of Sonet chip sets and other hardware.andP;  The standard's phaseshave been designed so that undefined elements can be accommodated by softwareand firmware until the committee reaches consensus.andP;  This approach allowsmanufacturers to design and deploy equipment with the confidence- thatsubsequent standardization will not require reengineenng.andM;One of the primary goals of Sonet is  interoperability of equipment fromdifferent vendors.andP;  Additional phases are expected to follow as currentlyundefined user applications test the limits of both the specification and thenetworks.andP;  No major surprises are anticipated.andP;  It is widely agreed that thethoroughness of the various T1 subcommittees and other organizationscontributing to the Sonet specification has resulted in a solid, workablestandard that will serve the industry well.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
