Juengling, a gas pipeline analyst forHoward Weil Lobouisse Friedrichs Inc. in Houston. ``In 1986, thevalues just weren't there.''   On Wednesday, Houston-based Tenneco announced it would beleaving the oil business by selling its oil and gas operations,concentrating instead on other industrial and pipeline ventures.   The company would not put an estimate on how much the salesmight bring, but George J. Gaspar, an oil analyst with Robert W.Baird andamp; Co. Inc. in Milwaukee, believes Tenneco has already courtedsome interested buyers.   ``I would expect they've had a nudge already, and decided to gopublic with the announcement to solicit other bids to make surethey will get the most attractive price possible,'' Gaspar said.   Tenneco, which posted 1987 revenue of $14.8 billion, will useproceeds from the sale to help pay its hefty $8.5 billion debt,Tenneco spokeswoman Suzanne Thomas said.   ``The new Tenneco will be a financially stronger and morefocused company,'' said James L. Ketelsen, Tenneco's chairman andchief executive officer.   ``With significantly reduced debt and capital expenditure needs,the company's earnings should improve materially, and its intrinsicvalue to shareholders will be secured and enhanced,'' he said.   Proceeds from the sale also may be used to repurchase shares ofthe company's common stock, depending on market conditions andtotal proceeds from the sale, Ketelsen added.   Tenneco has adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to thwarthostile takeover bids and prevent someone from gaining control ofthe company without offering a fair price to all shareholders.   The oil and gas ventures being sold are from the Tenneco Oil Co.subsidiary engaged in oil exploration, production, refining andmarketing.   In 1987, the subsidiary had revenue of $3.3 billion andoperating income of $233 million. Its proved reserves of crude oiland natural gas liquids were 407 million barrels at the end of1987. Natural gas reserves totaled 2.95 trillion cubic feet.   ``While profitable, these businesses are not now providingadequate returns on past invested capital, and we do not believetheir market value is fully reflected in Tenneco stock prices,''Ms. Thomas said.   ``The sale will unlock the underlying value and provide us fundsthat will enable us to take advantage of growth opportunities inour pipeline and industrial businesses.''   The current mix of business in Tenneco's energy ventures make up22 percent of the company's revenue, while all its industrial andpipeline ventures account for 78 percent, she said.   After the sale, Tenneco will be comprised of 31 percent farm andconstruction equipment, 23 percent pipeline, 14 percentshipbuilding, 13 percent auto parts, 10 percent packaging and 9percent chemicals.   The businesses are: Tenneco Automotive, an auto partsmanufacturer that includes Monroe shock absorbers and Walkerexhaust systems; Packaging Corp. of America, a major producer ofpaperboard, molded fiber, aluminum foil and plastic packaging;Newport News Shipbuilding, the largest privately owned shipyard inthe world; and Albright andamp; Wilson Ltd., a manufacturer and marketerof specialty chemicals and phosphates.   Tenneco said the businesses together have achieved a five-yearcompound annual growth rate of 18 percent in operating income andhave averaged 26 percent return on net assets employed.   The shipbuilding and auto parts companies are worth an estimated$1.25 billion each.   Tenneco also owns Case IH, the nation's second-largest farmequipment maker, and Tenneco Minerals. Ketelsen said Case should beable to reap benefits from further upturns in the domesticagricultural equipment business. Tenneco Minerals is a producer ofsoda ash and gold.   Tenneco also operates a Gas Pipeline Group, a 20,000-milenetwork of natural gas pipelines serving 26 states.</TEXT></DOC>
