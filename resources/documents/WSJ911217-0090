Yet quite a few works of fiction are available --and are suitable as holiday gifts -- that show children therisks and rewards of entrepreneurship, the necessity ofproductive work, and the burden of government regulations andtaxes.   High on any list, of course, are those two classic paeansto the work ethic, Watty Piper's &quot;The Little Engine ThatCould&quot; (Putnam, $3.95) and Paul Galdone's depiction of &quot;TheLittle Red Hen&quot; (Clarion, $13.95; paperback, $4.95).</LP><TEXT>   Donald Hall's &quot;The Ox-Cart Man&quot; (Viking/Penguin, $14.95;paperback, $4.95) tells how a 19th-century New England familyworked during the different seasons of the year in order tosell what it produced in the market.
