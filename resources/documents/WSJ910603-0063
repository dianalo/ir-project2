It's uncontested that blood pressure will drop in manyhypertensive patients if they go on a salt-free or low-saltdiet. This and other circumstantial evidence prompted federaland private health agencies in the early 1980s to launchcampaigns to get Americans in general to cut back on saltconsumption and reduce the prevalance of hypertension, whichaffects almost one-quarter of the U.S. population.   But low-salt diets may not be risk-free. Since April, someskeptics of low-salt regimens have been pointing to alittle-noticed implication of a highly publicized report by ateam of New York scientists. The report said hypertensionpatients with relatively high levels of a blood chemicalcalled renin were more prone to heart attacks thanhypertension patients with low renin levels.   Renin, produced by the kidneys, is one way the bodyregulates blood pressure. The chemical tends to elevate bloodpressure. So, when dietary salt is causing blood pressure torise, the kidneys reduce their output of renin. When theblood's salt concentration drops, the kidneys turn up theirrenin output to keep blood pressure from falling too low.Ergo, say the skeptics, the New York study implies thatcutting back salt consumption may cause a rise in blood reninlevels and thereby increase the risk of heart attack.   The study bolsters an argument by Dr. David A. McCarron ofthe Oregon Health Sciences University that the focus on saltis misplaced. His studies suggest that low calcium intake iswhat renders people susceptible to the pressure-raisingeffects of salt, and therefore calcium intake is the moreimportant dietary factor. The Salt Institute, a trade group,last month fired off a letter to the Food and DrugAdministration arguing that the agency should back off fromits official support of campaigns for low-salt diets.                                                                                                          Investigators Get   The Goods on Houseflies                                                                                                          FINALLY, the common housefly is convicted of itslong-alleged crime.   Since the early 1900s and the broad acceptance of the germtheory of disease, the housefly has been reviled as aspreader of filth. But the indictment rested oncircumstantial evidence: Bacteria picked up from garbage andsewage were found on flies that flitted around the kitchentable. It was assumed that the flies spread disease. But thekind of direct evidence that convicted mosquitoes and ticksof spreading disease was never found or presented against thehousefly.   The &quot;smoking gun&quot; has been found at two Israeli armytraining camps, where food was cooked in field kitchens andsoldiers used open-trench latrines. Tests found that latrinesat both camps had about the same number of diarrhea-causingshigella organisms. About 6% of the flies trapped at thecamps carried shigella.   An intensive fly control program at one camp resulted in ahousefly population 64% lower than at the other, &quot;control&quot;camp, where only routine insecticide spraying was done. Theincidence of shigella diarrhea was 85% lower at theexperimental camp than at the control camp during thefly-control effort, and blood tests found 75% fewer soldierswere infected with shigella, the Israeli researchers andtheir U.S. collaborators report in the journal the Lancet.                                                                                                          In Punctuation, Too,   Timing Is Everything                                                                                                          THE FAMILY of punctuation marks will get a new member --the extra space -- if a University of Rochester (N.Y.)linguist and psychologist has his way.   Thomas Bever recently tested a theory he and otherlinguists have developed. They believe that readingcomprehension is higher if  phrases  such  as  this  aremarked  off  by  an  extra  space, as is being done in thissentence, in an exaggerated way. It also helps to avoid&quot;breaking&quot; a phrase between two lines.   To this end, Mr. Bever and his students taught aneural-network computer to use the phrased format. Thecomputer then converted a textbook for an introductoryscience class to the format. Of the students who used thetext, 37% got an A or B for the course, while only 21% ofthose who used the standard textbook got such high grades.Only 12% of the students who used the new text failed ordropped the course, compared with 20% who used the standardtext.   Mr. Bever believes the phrased format could make complextexts, including The Wall Street Journal's financial-marketspages, easier to read. But, he acknowledges, publishers are abit conservative about such format changes. &quot;We're sort of inthe position of whoever it was who invented the comma,&quot; hesays.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          HALF of small children treated with decongestants got overtheir colds in two days, no different from the other half,which took sugar pills, Johns Hopkins researchers report inthe Journal of Pediatrics. . . .
