I have directed the National Security Council to review ournational security and defense policies and report back to me within90 days to ensure that our capabilities and resources meet ourcommitments and strategies.   I am also charging the Department of Defense with the task ofdeveloping a plan to improve the defense procurement process andmanagement of the Pentagon _ one which will fully implement thePackard Commission report. Many of the changes can only be made withthe participation of the Congress _ so I ask for your help.   We need fewer regulations. We need less bureaucracy. We needmultiyear procurement and two-year budgeting. And frankly, we needless congressional micromanagement of our nation's military policy.   Securing a more peaceful world is perhaps the most importantpriority I'd like to address tonight. We meet at a time ofextraordinary hope. Never before in this century have our values offreedom, democracy, and economic opportunity been such a powerfulpolitical and intellectual force around the globe.   Never before has our leadership been so crucial, because whileAmerica has its eyes on the future, the world has its eyes onAmerica.   It is a time of great change in the world _ and especially in theSoviet Union. Prudence and common sense dictate that we try tounderstand the full meaning of the change going on there, review ourpolicies carefully, and proceed with caution. But I have personallyassured General Secretary Gorbachev that, at the conclusion of sucha review, we will be ready to move forward. We will not miss anyopportunity to work for peace.   The fundamental fact remains that the Soviets retain a verypowerful military machine, in the service of objectives which arestill too often in conflict with ours. So let us take the newopenness seriously. Let us step forward to negotiate. But let usalso be realistic. And let us always be strong.   There are some pressing issues we must address: I will vigorouslypursue the Strategic Defense Initiative. The spread and even use ofsophisticated weaponry threatens global stability as never before.   Chemical weapons must be banned from the face of the Earth, neverto be used again. This won't be easy. Verification will bedifficult. But civilization and human decency demand that we try.   And the spread of nuclear weapons must be stopped. I will work tostrengthen the hand of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Ourdiplomacy must work every day against the proliferation of nuclearweapons.   And, around the globe, we must continue to be freedom's bestfriend. We must stand firm for self-determination and democracy inCentral America _ including in Nicaragua. For when people are giventhe chance, they inevitably will choose a free press, freedom ofworship, and certifiably free and fair elections.</TEXT><HEAD>MORE</HEAD></DOC>
