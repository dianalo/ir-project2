HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A protein that stimulates the body to produceblood cells may help doctors overcome a dangerous side effect ofintensive chemotherapy when treating cancer patients, researcherssaid.   The preliminary study is one of several under way to test thepowers of a newly identified class of growth boosters calledcolony-stimulating factors.   In the experiment, doctors from Duke University Medical Centergave a growth factor to cancer patients who had also received bonemarrow transplants and chemotherapy to fight advanced skin andbreast cancer.   Cancer drugs damage the bone marrow's ability to make whiteblood cells. Without enough of the disease-fighting cells, patientsmay fall victim to life-threatening infections.   The goal of the latest treatment was to restore patients' bloodcounts with transplanted doses of their own bone marrow, gatheredbefore the chemotherapy started, as well as injections of one kindof colony-stimulating factor.   The researchers found that the cancer patients' levels of whiteblood cells recovered dramatically, and that the treatment ``may beuseful in reducing the toxicity of high-dose chemotherapy.''   The study, directed by Dr. Stephen J. Brandt, was conducted on19 patients and published in today's New England Journal ofMedicine.   In the research, doctors used a naturally occurring protein,produced through gene splicing, that is called recombinant humangranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.   At New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston, Dr. Jerome Groopmanhas used the same growth factor to boost blood cell levels in AIDSpatients. He said he believes the proteins will have broadapplications in treating cancer patients.   ``Low white count leading to infection occurs in a number ofdifferent malignancies,'' Groopman said. ``I think at the least itwill make it more manageable and help support cancer patients.''   He said the treatment may also allow doctors to use higher dosesof cancer-killing drugs so that patients will have longerremissions.   ``The longer-range goal,'' he said, ``would be to improve thecure rate in certain cancers.''   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Arthur W. Nienhuis of theNational Heart, Lung and Blood Institute said the Duke researchers``have achieved an important objective'' by showing what dose ofgrowth factor can be used safely.   He added that the availability of the factors ``seems destinedto launch a new therapeutic era for those concerned with thetreatment of patients with bone marrow failure.''</TEXT></DOC>
