SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Geographic Society on Thursdayunveiled a massive 35-foot globe, the centerpiece in Geographica, ahigh-tech multi-media science and geography exhibition two yearsaway from being finished.   Lady Bird Johnson pressed a button to turn on the 1,550-poundglobe, repeating her effort 25 years ago, when she helped dedicatethe original globe and display in Explorers Hall at the magazine'sheadquarters.   Mrs. Johnson congratulated the society for its efforts to``illuminate our understanding'' that the entire world is onesociety.   The new globe, with a circumfrance of 35 feet, is composed of54,739 square inches of epoxy resin and Fiberglas cloth painted inpainstaking detail by artist John Bonner, who spent 3,127 hourshighlighting vegetation, deserts, national boundaries and underseafeatures.   The globe is lifted on a cushion of air and can be rotated so anyportion can face the audience. Lights display the movement ofsunlight and shadow around the world.   Occasionally work had to be sanded off and changed in progress,Bonner said. For example, a visiting Indian official who saw thework informed the society that an area shown as a swamp had dried upinto a salt lake _ so it was changed.   And the configuration of the Antarctic ice shelf had to be redoneafter a giant iceberg broke off.   Geographic officials did take one precaution to save work in theevent of political changes. National boundaries were applied withautomotive pinstripe tape so that they can be relocated if necessary.   The renovated exhibition area includes a 72-seat theater, aweather display including satellite readouts and a ``tornado'' in atube, video shows depicting exotic cultures and both rare and commonanimals.   While the exhibit won't be finished for two years, the society'spresident, Gilbert M. Grosvenor, said the public will be admittedstarting Saturday to see the many displays already in operation.</TEXT></DOC>
