It is one of our greatest achievementsand most valued assets, conveying each of us and virtually every item ofour commerce.    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The steaming piston, the whirring turbine, and the spinning wheelof the high-speed train are familiar symbols of this indispensible supportof our daily activities. New symbols join the list every year, such asthe ``pillar of fire'' of the space shuttle or the promise of the magneticlevitation train. From covered wagons and the Erie Canal to jumbo jetsand superhighways, the network of roads, air routes, and waterways thatconstitute America's transportation system has increased our productivity,spurred our economic growth, and logistically strengthened our nationaldefense. Our transportation system provides the arteries we need to workwith America's allies in ensuring our common security and enables us todeploy and supply our forces overseas.    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">With the growth of our transportation needs have come new demandsand challenges, but the transportation industry has continued working tomeet them, promoting the development of a more reliable, convenient, andefficient transportation system.    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">There has also been a growing awareness of the need for transportationsafety. Americans are working together to eliminate the menace of drunkand drugged driving; communities are promoting education programs and morestringent laws designed to improve transportation safety; and judges aregetting tougher when dealing with offenders. The Government and privatesector are united in these efforts to reduce fatalities and accident ratesto the lowest levels in history. We owe a tremendous debt of gratitudeto the men and women who dedicate themselves to saving lives and preventinginjuries.    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In recognition of the importance of transportation and of the millionsof Americans who serve and supply our transportation needs, the Congress,by joint resolution approved May 16, 1957, has requested that the thirdFriday in May of each year be designated as ``National Defense TransportationDay,'' and by joint resolution approved May 14, 1962, that the week inwhich that Friday falls be proclaimed ``National Transportation Week.''   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE BUSH, President of the United States ofAmerica, do hereby designate Friday, May 19, 1989, as National DefenseTransportation Day and the week beginning May 14, 1989, as National TransportationWeek.

Osteoporosis, or porous bone, is actually a commondisease that afflicts approximately 25 million Americans. It is often calledthe ``silent disease'' because it develops over many years without symptoms.This silent disease is the leading cause of bone fractures in postmenopausalwomen in particular, and in elderly persons in general. In fact, osteoporosiscauses more than 1.3 million fractures of the spine, wrist, and hips eachyear.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The impact on individuals and society in terms of physical, emotional,and financial suffering is enormous. Osteoporosis and osteoporotic fracturescost the Nation an estimated $10 billion annually. Fortunately, we nowknow that fractures caused by osteoporosis may be preventable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">To reduce the risks of developing osteoporosis, we must begin a healthyregimen early in life. It is important to build the maximum amount of bonemass possible during childhood and adolescence and to keep our bones strongduring adulthood. In our later years, it is particularly important to preventthe falls and accidents that can lead to bone fractures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Research has shown that, before an individual is 35 years old, moderateexercise and proper nutrition_including an adequate intake of calcium_mayhelp to build bone mass. Other investigations have indicated that, forpostmenopausal women, estrogen replacement therapy, a sufficient supplyof calcium, and regular weight-bearing exercise all help to curb the rateof bone loss.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">New scientific, medical, and educational approaches to the preventionand treatment of osteoporosis will help to improve the health of all Americans.As individuals, each of us can protect ourselves and our children fromthis potentially debilitating disease by maintaining a healthy diet andregular exercise program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 37, has designated the weekbeginning May 14, 1989, and the week beginning May 13, 1990, as ``NationalOsteoporosis Prevention Week'' and has authorized and requested the Presidentto issue a proclamation in observance of these events.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE BUSH, President of the United States ofAmerica, do hereby proclaim the week of May 14 through May 20, 1989, andthe week of May 13 through May 19, 1990, as ``National Osteoporosis PreventionWeek.''

On Armed Forces Day,we honor the men and women who serve in our Army, Navy, Air Force, MarineCorps, and Coast Guard.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">A nation's military strength is not found in its defensive systemsand weapons alone, or even in the number of the men and women in uniform_theirfaith, readiness, will, and devotion_that makes a nation's armed forcesproud and strong. As Patrick Henry observed when urging his fellow Americansto fight four our country's independence: ``The battle . . . is not tothe strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Patrick Henry's observation accents the theme for this 40th anniversaryobservance of Armed Forces Day: ``Keeping America Strong.'' Our Nationis strong today because the members of our Armed Forces are vigilant, active,and brave. America's service men and women are mindful of the preciousnature of freedom and peace and of our responsibility to preserve themfor generations yet unborn; they are prepared to defend innocent peoplefrom the aggression of terrorists and totalitarian governments; and theyare both courageous in danger and confident in ``the holy cause of liberty.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The members of America's Armed Forces are part of the noble legionsthat have never failed to defend our Nation or her interests anywhere inthe world. As our recent experience in Grenada and the Persian Gulf soforcefully reminded us, securing peace and advancing the cause of libertyrequire such constant strength and determination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Today, I join with all Americans in thanking the members of the UnitedStates Armed Forces for so faithfully defending our freedom and nationalsecurity.
