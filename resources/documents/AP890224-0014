Dennis DeConcini,D-Ariz., John McCain, R-Ariz., and Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., in aletter Thursday to Bush.   By putting someone at the White House in charge of Indian issues,Bush would ``send a signal throughout the Indian communities of yourdedication to America's first inhabitants,'' they said.   The senators are members of the Senate Select Committee on IndianAffairs and have been conducting special investigative hearings on awide range of problems on reservations and within governmentagencies doing business with them.   They said they wanted to meet as soon as possible with whomeverBush designates.   The senators said their hearings will likely produce legislativeproposals for correcting longtime deficiencies in governmentpolicies toward Indians.   The White House could, in the meantime, get reform started, theysaid.   In their letter, the senators said testimony before theircommittee casts doubt on whether the federal government is meetingits responsibility to protecting the rights of American Indians totheir land, water, forest, hunting, fishing and mineral resources.   ``As we are sure you will agree, legal representation is at thevery core of the federal government's trust responsibility toAmerican Indians,'' they said. ``The inherent conflicts facing thefederal trustee arise not only in legal matters, but also in policydecisions.''   The president was in Japan Thursday for the funeral of the lateEmperor Hirohito. There was no immediate response to the senators'letter from the White House.</TEXT></DOC>
