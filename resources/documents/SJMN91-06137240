I want to applaud you for running thestory, for having Karen T. Borchers and Michalene Busico do the research theydid and spend the time they did to present a look at what being a young gay orlesbian person means.;    Young people face enormous challenges growing up.Gay and lesbian youth face additional challenges when families, schools andreligious groups can be critical and abusive.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ARTICLE EASED ISOLATION OF GAY OR LESBIANTEENS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     It's unfortunate that what society needs most is education about this --yet whenever articles such as yours appear, there is hateful backlash.;    Ihope you will continue to present information to the public and support forthe gay and lesbian population in this area. Our minority group faces manyobstacles to achieve what all citizens want: a safe home environment, a safework environment, access to services, and acceptance by the community atlarge.;    If there had been education and support programs when I was growingup different, my high school and college days would have been easier.;    --Judy Rickard; San Jose; (hbox);    When I was 34, I fell in love with a woman,and it was one of the deepest joys I had ever known to finally identifymyself. When I was 37, I came out to my parents and my sisters and brothers,and I experienced one of the deepest fears I had ever known.;    But I was inmy 30s, so I had a support system, I had role models, I had resources, I hadsome understanding of myself. Even so, every time I came out to someone Icared about, I risked being denigrated, ostracized and emotionally abandoned-- not because of who I am but because of who I love, and because I chose notto hide my sexuality.;    Teen-agers who discover they are gay, lesbian orbisexual need support, role models and resources. They deserve the continuedlove of parents, siblings and friends, and they deserve respect from a worldthat wants to deny they exist. Thank you for reminding them that they are notalone.;    -- Verna Watterson; Cupertino  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910516  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  369  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday May 16, 199100137240,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
