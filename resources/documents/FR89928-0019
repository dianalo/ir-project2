Priorto description of <T3>P. praeclara </T3>the two species were considered as <T3>P. leucophaea, </T3>with a total range including 21 states and twoprovinces (Correll 1950, Luer 1975). Their joint distribution pattern extendsfrom Oklahoma north to Manitoba, and east in a narrowing peninsula throughthe Great Lakes states to Maine. Populations also range westward throughNebraska in groundwater maintained habitats. <T3>P. leucophaea </T3>occurs primarily east of the Mississippi River,while <T3>P. praeclara </T3>is restricted to west of the Mississippi (Sheviakand Bowles 1986). Both species require full sunlight and usually inhabittall grass calcareous silt loam or sub irrigated sand prairies. In theeast, <T3>P. leucophaea </T3>also occupies calcareous wetlands, including openportions of fens, sedge meadows, marshes, and bogs (Bowles 1983). The prairie fringed orchids are perennial herbs which regenerate from afusiform tuber rootstock. Their tubers are dormant during winter and thusare adapted to dormant season prairie fires; such fires and high precipitationlevels appear to promote flowering (Sheviak 1974, Roosa and Eilers 1979,Bowles 1983, Currier 1984). Leaves and an inflorescence (if flower primordiawere set the prior year) usually emerge in May, and flowering begins bylate June to early July. These species are characterized by large whiteflowers (the largest in the genus) arranged in an inflorescence that mayreach 12 decimeters (47 inches) high with up to 40 flowers. The flowersare fragrant after sunset and adapted to pollination by night flying hawkmothswhich ingest a high volume nectar resource from long nectar spurs (Bowles1983). Pollination is required for seed production, while seedling establishmentdepends upon development of mycorrhizae with a favorable soil inhabitingfungus (reviewed in Bowles 1983). Differences in flower structures andpollination mechanics serve to isolate the species from hybridization;these features can be used to identify living or preserved specimens (Sheviakand Bowles 1986). The western species has larger flowers adapted to placingpollinia (pollen masses) on the compound eyes of visiting pollinators Incontrast, the eastern species places pollinia on the proboscis of visitingmoths. <T3>Platanthera leucophaea </T3>has declined over 70 per cent from originalcounty records and now has about 52 extant populations in seven states.Primarily due to the destruction of large grasslands east of the MississippiRiver, extremely large or extensive populations of this orchid do not existin the United States. In Canada, 12 populations are known from fens andprairies in 12 Ontario counties; one fen population is estimated at 2000plants (Brownell 1984). The plant is also known from New Brunswick, whereit is considered rare (Hinds 1983). However, most of these populationsare not representative of the once vast prairie habitat that supportedmost populations of this orchid. <T3>Platanthera leucophaea </T3>is presumed extirpated from Oklahoma, wherethe type specimen was collected by Nuttall in 1819 near the confluenceof the Kiamichi and Red Rivers; it may have occurred in similar floodplainhabitat in adjacent Arkansas (Sheviak and Bowles 1986). This orchid reachedits western range limit in Nebraska, where one historic record is known(W.J. Bailey, Jr., Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, <T3>in litt. </T3>1988). It has not been relocated in Missouri (Morgan1980), but one small population with three plants remains in Iowa. In theeastern United States, this orchid has not been relocated in New York,Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Indiana; isolated disjunct populations stilloccur in Maine and Virginia (Bowles 1983). The Maine population occurson private land, which is on the State's register of critical areas, inportions of an extensive fen that is undergoing some invasion by woodyvegetation. Flowering plants appear erratically at this site. The currentpopulation appears to be about 20 adult individuals (Barbara Vickery, TheNature Conservancy, <T3>in litt. </T3>1988). The small Virginia population occurs in a sedgemeadow subject to light grazing. However, this population has not beenobserved since 1983 when three flowering stems were counted (S.M. Carbaugh,Virginia Department of Agriculture, <T3>in litt. </T3>1988). The eastern prairie fringed orchid is known historically from 23 Michigancounties; 18 populations (about half are protected) now are extant fromnine counties, where 1322 flowering stems were counted in 1984 (Chapmanand Crispin 1985). Southern Michigan populations are small and occur inisolated bog habitats; while several larger populations of over 100 plantsoccur in lakeside prairies bordering Saginaw Bay. Three large Michiganpopulations, totalling about 900 plants, occur on degraded upland prairiesbordering Lake Erie. These sites are State owned, but extensive managementis needed to maintain the orchids as their communities go through successionalchanges. A population near Bay City disappeared after severe flooding in1986, and has not been observed since (G.T. Higgs, James Clements AirportAdvisory Committee, <T3>in litt. </T3>1988). The Saginaw Bay region continues to harbor themost viable populations in the state ( Chapman and Crispin 1985). FrederickW. Case, Jr. (1987) states that <T3>P. leucophaea </T3>is possibly the region's most endangered orchidbecause of the destruction of its moist prairie habitat. <T3>Platanthera leucophaea </T3>originally occurred in 11 Ohio countiesand is now presumed extirpated from at least six. McCance (Ohio Departmentof Conservation, <T3>in litt. </T3>1987) reported only two extant populations in 1987. Thelarger, containing about 60 flowering plants in 1987, was down from 367plants in 1982. The other population contained 46 flowering plants in 1984,but only six plants were found in 1987. Smith (The Nature Conservancy,<T3>in litt. </T3>1988) reports this population has further declined totwo plants. Two other populations are known from sites frequently inundatedby Lake Erie. One of these was located in 1987 when 24 plants were counted.Smith (1981) also observed this population in 1988 and counted 14 plants.The other site has not been relocated (C.R. Moseley. Jr. Ohio Departmentof Natural Resources, <T3>in litt. </T3>1988). In Wisconsin, this orchid originally was knownfrom 22 sites in 17 counties in the south and southeast portions of thestate (Alverson 1981). Fourteen of these are known to be extirpated (J.Dobberpuhl, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, <T3>in litt. </T3>1988). Nine small populations now occur in eight counties.One large population of several hundred plants occurs in a protected LakeMichigan border sand prairie in Kenosha County. Illinois probably contained the largest and most extensive pre-settlementpopulations of the eastern prairie fringed orchid and also sustained themost drastic population decline of any state. Originally it was known fromtall grass prairies in 33 counties across the northern two thirds of theState, an area now almost totally converted to agriculture (Bowles andKurz 1981). Eighteen populations remain in eight counties concentratedin the Chicago region; two additional populations occur in cemetery prairiesin eastern and western Illinois counties. Only two populations consistof over 100 plants; both are in a Lake Michigan border county. Most populationsare offered some form of protection, and only eight occur on private unprotectedland. <T3>Platanthera praeclara</T3> has experienced over a 60 percent declineaccording to county records, with about 37 populations remaining in sevenstates (Bowles and Duxbury 1986). Apparently, it has been extirpated fromSouth Dakota where it was originally known from two counties. Populationsin the southern part of this orchid's range seldom are observed. The twoOklahoma populations occur in privately owned hay meadows and were onlyobserved during their original discovery (Magrath and Taylor 1978). Thisorchid was widespread in eastern Kansas, where it was originally knownfrom 14 counties. Now, populations are reduced to eight counties whereit is believed to occur in seven privately owned hay meadows and one Universityof Kansas research area (R.E. Brooks, U. of Kansas, <T3>in litt. </T3>1987). Two small populations currently are known to occurin northwest Missouri. One population of five plants occurs on a privatetract, while a second, of about 25 plants, is in a hay meadow recentlyacquired by the state. Populations in the northern and central portions of the western prairiefringed orchid's range are larger and more extensive, but still reducedin size and range. This orchid probably was most widespread in the deeploess soils of Iowa, where a total of about 600 plants currently exist.Now, 13 populations are known extant from 11 Iowa counties (D. Howell,Iowa Department of Natural Resources, pers. comm. 1987). Most populationsare small, with the largest consisting of about 275 plants. Six of theIowa populations are in public or private conservation ownership and aremanaged by burning or mowing. <T3>Platanthera praeclara</T3> originally was widespread in eastern Nebraska(Bowles and Duxbury 1986). A questionable historic record from 1842 attributedto Wyoming is now considered to be from Western Nebraska (H. Marriott,The Nature Conservancy, <T3>in litt. </T3>1987). Five populations are known from four counties.Two populations are small (less than 20 plants each) and disjunct in westernNebraska; one occurs on a railroad right-of-way, while the other is onFederal land (Valentine National Wildlife Refuge) administered by the U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service. The federally owned tract is undergoing brushinvasion. Three other sites in eastern Nebraska are on private or publicland managed for conservation. Four of the five sites in Nebraska receivesome type of protection and management. The largest population consistsof about 150 plants. Five other <T3>Platanthera praeclara</T3> sites in Nebraska are assumed extirpatedas their status is unknown. One large scattered population occurs in North Dakota with approximately2000 plants (Bowles and Duxbury 1986). The North Dakota population representsthe type locality for <T3>Platanthera praeclara</T3> (Sheviak and Bowles 1986) and occurs primarilyon Federally owned sand prairie managed by the U.S. Forest Service. TheForest Service has initiated a monitoring program for <T3>P. praeclara</T3> in order to establish some baseline data. Guidelinesto protect the plant during haying operations and herbicide applicationsto control leafy spurge are in place. Research is needed to determine whateffects current management has on the orchids, and if increases in grazingintensity would negatively affect their populations. Six populations occurin four Minnesota counties (Smith 1981). The largest is in protected ownershipand is found at five sites with about 500 plants. This orchid recentlywas discovered in similar prairie habitat in Manitoba (Brownell 1984).Federal Government action on these plants began as a result of Section12 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>), which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institutionto prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered, threatened,or extinct. This report (Ayensu and DeFilipps 1978), designated as HouseDocument No. 94-51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. <T3>Platanthera leucophaea,</T3> which at that time was placed in the genus<T3>Habenaria </T3>and included in part the then undescribed <T3>P. praeclara</T3>, was listed as ``threatened'' in that document. OnJuly 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the Smithsonianreport as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) of the Act (nowsection 4(b)(3)) and of its intention to review the status of plant taxanamed within. On June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> (41 FR 24523) to determine approximately 1,700vascular plant species to be endangered species pursuant to section 4 ofthe Act. The list of 1,700 plant taxa was assembled on the basis of commentsand data received by the Smithsonian Institution and the Service in responseto House Document No. 94-51 and the July 1, 1975, <T4>Federal Register</T4> publication. <T3>Platanthera leucophaea</T3> was included in the July 1, 1975, noticeof review and the June 16, 1976, proposal. General comments received inrelation to the 1976 proposal were summarized in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 26, 1978 (FR 17909). On December 10,1979, the Service published a notice (44 FR 70796) withdrawing the portionof the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, along withfour other proposals that had expired due to a procedural requirement ofthe 1978 Amendments to the Act. On December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82479), andSeptember 27, 1985 (50 FR 39525), the Service published revised noticesof review for native plants in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. <T3>Platanthera leucophaea </T3>(including in part the then yet undescribed<T3>P. praeclara</T3>) initially was included in those notices as a category1 species. Category 1 species are those for which biological informationin the Service's possession warrants listing as endangered or threatened.Later, this orchid was dropped to category 2, indicating that further biologicalresearch and field study were needed to ascertain its status. The Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1982 required that all petitionspending as of October 13, 1982, be treated as having been submitted onthat date. The deadline for a finding on those species, including <T3>Platanthera leucophaea</T3>, was October 13, 1983. On October 13, 1983,and again in 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1987, the petition finding was thatlisting of <T3>Platanthera leucophaea </T3>(including in part the then yet to be described<T3>P. praeclara</T3>) was warranted pending finding of further biologicalinformation but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordancewith section 4(b)3(B)(iii) of the Act. Such a finding requires that thepetition be recycled, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. TheOctober 11, 1988 (53 FR 39621) proposal to classify <T3>Platanthera leucophaea </T3>and <T3>P. praeclara </T3>as threatened constituted the final required finding.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Recommendations</ITAG>In the October 11, 1988, proposed rule and associated notifications, allinterested parties were requested to submit factual reports or informationthat might contribute to the development of a final rule. Appropriate Stateagencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations,landowners, and other interested parties were contacted and requested tocomment. Notices inviting public comment were published in the followingnewspapers: <T3>Chicago Tribune, </T3>Chicago, IL; <T3>The Des Moines Register, </T3>Des Moines, IA; <T3>The Globe-Gazette, </T3>Mason City, IA; <T3>Sioux City Journal, </T3>Sioux City, IA; <T3>Waterloo Courier, </T3>Waterloo, IA; <T3>Lawrence Journal-World, </T3>Lawrence, KS; <T3>The Leavenworth Times,</T3> Leavenworth, KS; <T3>Ottawa Herald, </T3>Ottawa, KS; <T3>Topeka Capitol Journal, </T3>Topeka, KS; <T3>Bangor Daily News, </T3>Bangor, ME; <T3>The Bay City Times, </T3>Bay City, MI; <T3>Detroit Free Press, </T3>Detroit, MI; <T3>Three Rivers Commercial News, </T3>Three Rivers, MI; <T3>Austin Daily Herald, </T3>Austin, MN; <T3>Crookston Daily News, </T3>Crookston, MN; <T3>Rock County Stat-Herald, </T3>Luverne, MN; <T3>St. Joseph News-Press/Gazette, </T3>St. Joseph, MO; <T3>The Grand Island Independent, </T3>Grand Island, NE; <T3>The Lincoln Star </T3>and <T3>Lincoln Journal, </T3>Lincoln, NE; <T3>Valentine Newspaper, </T3>Valentine, NE; <T3>The Forum, </T3>Fargo, ND; <T3>The Ransom County Gazette, </T3>Lisbon, ND; <T3>Daily News, </T3>Wahpeton, ND; <T3>Tulsa Tribune, </T3>Tulsa, OK; <T3>Daily News Leader, </T3>Staunton, VA; <T3>Wisconsin State Journal, </T3>Madison, WI; <T3>The Janesville Gazette, </T3>Janesville, WI; <T3>The Milwaukee Journal, </T3>Milwaukee, WI; <T3>Oshkosh Northwestern, </T3>Oshkosh, WI between October 25, and November3; and in the <T3>Sioux Falls Argus-Leader, </T3>Sioux Falls, SD, on November 22, 1988.Twenty-four comments were received, none of which opposed the rule. A summaryof substantive comments is presented below.Comments were submitted by two Federal agencies, twelve State agencies,three conservation organizations, and seven individuals. Fourteen responsessupported listing while the remainder did not express a position. The U.S.Forest Service commented that the area in North Dakota, within the SheyenneRanger District (Sheyenne National Grassland), containing an extensivepopulation of <T3>Platanthera praeclara </T3>(Western Prairie fringed Orchid) has beengrazed for about 100 years, and the continued existence of the species,and the possibility it may be increasing, indicates to them that theremay not be a need to list the species. However, the Forest Service acknowledgesthat plants must be listed rangewide, and because the species is decliningelsewhere within its range, does not oppose the listing. The Forest Servicepoints out that while overgrazing may be contributing to the decline ofthe species, there does not appear to be strong evidence that grazing byitself is as detrimental to the species as cropland conversion. The ForestService has recognized the need to integrate rare species management intomanagement activities on the Sheyenne Ranger District and has developedguidelines to protect the plant during haying and pesticide application.The Forest Service looks forward to a cooperative recovery effort and isinitiating an Interim Management Plan specifically for the enhancementof this species, until such time as research has provided the answers forfurther management. The Soil Conservation Service office in North Dakotacommented that a litter buildup may suppress <T3>P. praeclara, </T3>and rotational grazing may be beneficial.The Sheyenne Valley Grazing Association commented that the Service is proposingto list <T3>Platanthera praeclara</T3> without knowing all the facts about thespecies, what is ideal habitat, how mowing affects the plant, and if anythingother than cropping is harmful to the species. In addition, the GrazingAssociation expressed concerns about the methods of listing plants, andif plants could be listed by population, the more healthy populations likethe one on the Sheyenne National Grasslands would be unaffected. The Associationdoes not oppose the listing, but believes even with listing we will nothave all the answers. They want to be kept informed of the situation. TheService has completed range wide status surveys for <T3>Platanthera praeclara </T3>and <T3>Platanthera leucophaea. </T3>As as result of these surveys, and otherbiological documentation, the Service believes listing is appropriate.There might be instances where some populations of the plant may be inbetter condition than others, but range wide, both species have declinedsignificantly and will continue to face threats of habitat destructionand alteration. By placing these species under the protection of the Act,the Service, and other cooperating Federal and State agencies will be ableto complete recovery plans, initiate and complete research, and completeother management actions that will provide information to enhance bothspecies' survival.The remaining comments, from State agencies, private conservation organizations,and individuals provided new species status information, advice of additionalstate protection, or lack thereof, mentioned the existence of localizedthreats to the species, and offered editorial comments concerning the rule.These comments have been incorporated into this final rule as deemed appropriate.A letter from a private conservation group supporting the listing was signedby 28 members of the organization.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species </ITAG>After a thorough review and consideration of all information available,the Service has determined that <T3>Platanthera leucophaea </T3>(Nutt.) Lindl. and <T3>Platanthera praeclara </T3>Sheviak and Bowles should be classifiedas threatened species. Procedures found at section 4(a)(1) of the Act andregulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisionsof the Act were followed. A species may be determined to be endangeredor threatened due to one or more of the five factors described in section4(a)(1). These factors and their application to <T3>Platanthera leucophaea </T3>(Nutt.) Lindl. and <T3>Platanthera praeclara </T3>Sheviak and Bowles are as follows: A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailmentof Its Habitat or Range The prairie fringed orchids have declined significantly throughout theirranges due to conversion of most of their habitats to cropland, overgrazing,intensive hay mowing, drainage, and for fire protection; these and relatedthreats continue. Many of the largest <T3>Platanthera leucophaea </T3>populations occur in habitats supportingsuccessional vegetation. Without management these populations may declinein response to changing vegetation patterns. Many other populations aresmall and occur on small isolated prairie remnants, where seed set andreproduction is limited by dependence on chance visitation from pollinators.Over 35 percent of the known populations of <T3>Platanthera praeclara </T3>occur in hay meadows; these plants seldomare seen, and populations apparently are small. Hay mowing annually removesseed capsules and plant biomass before natural seed dispersal can occur.This prevents recruitment of seedlings into populations and probably weakensadult plants, resulting in gradual population decline through attrition(Bowles 1983, Bowles and Duxbury 1986). Changing land use also threatenshay meadow populations. At least four Kansas hay meadows known to support<T3>Platanthera praeclara </T3>populations have been converted to cultivatedcropland since their discovery in the 1970's, while one Oklahoma hay meadownow is threatened with subdivision (Bowles and Duxbury 1986). The use ofherbicides, especially on highway and railroad rights-of-way, continuesto threaten these species in a number of instances (P.E. DeHond, MainePlanning Office, <T3>in litt. </T3>1988, and L.G. Hiller,. Ft. Ranson, ND, <T3>in litt. </T3>1988). B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or EducationalPurposes Native terrestrial orchids rarely are grown from seed; adult plants areoften sought for scientific and commercial purposes, or for private gardens.Smaller populations of the prairie fringed orchids would be adversely affectedby collecting. Because of higher human population densities in the east,the eastern prairie fringed orchid is subject to greater scientific andcommercial pressures; at least one Michigan population was affected byremoval of plants. However, because of the recent description of <T3>Platanthera praeclara </T3>(western prairie fringed orchid) and itsusually small populations, over-collecting may also become a serious problemfor this species. At least one instance of removal of a western prairiefringed orchid plant for commercial purposes has taken place in Minnesota.C. Disease or Predation No diseases are known to be adversely affecting either prairie fringedorchid species. All inflorescences were removed from one Minnesota populationof <T3>Platanthera praeclara </T3>by an unknown herbivore, but the long termimpact remains unknown. Conehead grasshoppers (Orthoptera: <T3>Neoconocephalus</T3>) occasionally are observed eating the flowersor fruits of these orchids. However, the major predator is man throughuse of this orchid's community for pasture or hay. Long term overgrazingor haying apparently leads to population decline because plants eitherare harvested or are not allowed to complete their life cycles. D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms The prairie fringed orchids are formally or officially listed as endangered,threatened, or rare in ten states (IA, IL, ME, MI, MN, MO, NE, ND, OH,WI) throughout their range. However, only a few states where these speciesare extant offer protection to listed plants beyond that afforded by theirpresence on public lands. State laws of Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan,and Missouri prohibit the removal and sale of listed plants. Michigan prohibitstransport, buying, selling, possessing, or destroying in any manner. InWisconsin, Ohio, and New York it is illegal to harvest endangered or threatenedplants. Although <T3>Platanthera leucophaea </T3>and <T3>P. praeclara </T3>are offered various forms of recognition or protectionunder state laws, the Endangered Species Act offers possibilities for protectionthrough section 6 by cooperation between States and the Service, and cooperationwith other Federal agencies through section 7 (interagency cooperation)requirements. The plants are considered rare in Canada, but are not affordedany official designation or protection. E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence.Pollination of the prairie fringed orchids is required for seed set, andis accomplished only by hawkmoths (Sphingidae). As a result, long-termpopulation survival requires maintenance of hawkmoths. Any threat to theseinsects (such as the use of insecticides) or their habitats and food plants,is a threat to survival of prairie fringed orchids. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific information availableregarding the past, present, and future threats faced by these taxa, indetermining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation, the preferredaction is to list <T3>Platanthera leucophaea </T3>and <T3>Platanthera praeclara </T3>as threatened species, because of the knownloss of most of their populations and habitat, and continued threats toexisting populations. For reasons detailed below, it is not consideredprudent to propose designation of critical habitat. <ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires, to the maximum extent prudent anddeterminable, that the Secretary designate critical habitat at the timethe species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The designationof critical habitat is not considered to be prudent when such designationwould not be of net benefit to the species involved (50 CFR 424.12). Inthe present case, the Service believes that designation of critical habitatwould not be prudent because no benefit to the species can be identifiedthat would outweigh the potential threat of vandalism or collection, whichmight be exacerbated by the publication of a detailed critical habitatdescription. <ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States. It also requires that recovery actions be carried out for alllisted species. These recovery actions are initiated by the Service followinglisting. Some may be undertaken prior to listing, circumstances permitting.Potential habitat management actions that might benefit <T3>Platanthera leucophaea </T3>and <T3>P. praeclara </T3>include: evaluation and specific management actionson public lands to enhance orchid populations, land protection measureswhich will reduce frequent disturbance to both species' habitat, and aprogram for landowners to educate them about the nature of their orchidpopulations and how they might alter management of their property to benefitthese species. The protection required by Federal agencies and applicableprohibitions are discussed below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requiresFederal agencies to insure that activities they authorize, fund, or carryout are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed speciesor to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal actionmay affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible federalagency must enter into formal consultation with the service. The Food Security Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-198) also provides at sections1314 and 1318 opportunities for the Service and State conservation agenciesto acquire restrictive easements beneficial to endangered and threatenedspecies on lands acquired by the Farmers Home Administration in the courseof farm foreclosures. Upon notification by the Farmers Home Administrationof pending foreclosures, the Service is continually reviewing possibleareas where restrictive easements would benefit endangered and threatenedspecies. No Federal involvement is expected for <T3>Platanthera leucophaea </T3>since the species is not known to occuron Federal lands. <T3>Platanthera praeclara </T3>is known to occur on lands under the jurisdictionof the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on the Valentine National WildlifeRefuge, in Nebraska. Grazing management plans on the refuge should considerthe effects livestock has on the species. A population monitoring programfor <T3>P. praeclara </T3>should be initiated. A widely scattered populationof <T3>P. praeclara </T3>is found on the Sheyenne National Grassland, CusterNational Forest, Ransom and Richland counties, North Dakota. This populationextends over several thousand acres managed by the U.S. Forest Servicewhich in turn leases the area to the Sheyenne Valley Grazing Associationfor livestock production. The Forest Service and the Grazing Associationare aware of <T3>P. praeclara. </T3>The species is found on 25 of the 58 allotmentswithin the Sheyenne National Grassland. In order to meet the intent ofthe Act, the U.S. Forest Service, in cooperation with the Service, theState of North Dakota, and the Sheyenne Valley Grazing Association, isinitiating interim grazing management actions on the Sheyenne NationalGrasslands which is designed to safeguard <T3>P. praeclara </T3>until such time as recovery research has been completedthat should provide results to guide us in future management. Researchwill soon be underway which will allow us to better understand which typesof management actions within the Grassland area might be beneficial to<T3>P. praeclara. </T3>Cooperative discussions between the Forest Service,the Grazing Association, and the Service have been initiated. It will benecessary for the Forest Service to enter into consultation with the Serviceso that <T3>Platanthera praeclara </T3>plants are considered in the course of activitiescarried out by that agency. It has been the experience of the Service thatthe majority of section 7 consultations are resolved so that the speciesis protected and the project can continue. The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.71 and 17.72set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptions that applyto all threatened plants. With respect to <T3>Platanthera leucophaea </T3>and <T3>P. praeclara, </T3>all trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of theAct, implemented by 50 CFR 17.71, will apply. These prohibitions, in part,make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the UnitedStates to import or export, transport in interstate or foreign commercein the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for sale these speciesin interstate or foreign commerce, or remove and reduce to possession thesespecies from areas under Federal jurisdiction. Seeds from cultivated specimensof threatened plant species are exempt from these prohibitions providedthat a statement of ``cultivated origin'' appears on their containers.In addition, for listed plants, the 1988 amendments (Pub. L 100-478) tothe Act prohibit the malicious damage or destruction on Federal lands andthe removal, cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroying of listed plantsin knowing violation of any State law or regulation, including State criminaltrespass law. Certain exceptions would apply to agents of the Service andState conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.72 also provide forthe issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingthreatened species under certain circumstances. It is anticipated thatsome trade permits would be issued because these plants belong to the orchidfamily, species of which now are sought for cultivation. On July 1, 1975, <T3>Platanthera leucophaea </T3>was included in Appendix II of the Conventionon International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES),which is implemented through section 8A of the Act. The effect of thislisting is that generally, both export and import permits are requiredbefore international shipment may occur. Such shipment is strictly regulatedby CITES member nations to prevent it from being detrimental to the survivalof the species, and generally, cannot be allowed if it is for primarilycommercial purposes. If plants are certified as artificially propagated,however, international shipment requires only export documents under CITES,and commercial shipments may be allowed. Requests for copies of the regulationson plants and inquiries regarding them may be addressed to the Office ofManagement Authority, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 3507, Arlington,VA 22203, (703/358-2093). <ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that Environmental Assessments,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).  <ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Alverson, W.S. 1981.
