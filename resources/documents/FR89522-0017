This grantprogram is one of many programs and activities that in combination helpform an overall pre- and post-disaster mitigation strategy for a Stateor local unit of government. It is closely tied to the post-disaster mitigationplans required under section 409 of the Stafford Act, which form the basisfor identifying measures to be funded under section 404. Other existinghazard mitigation plans or programs in the disaster area are also usefulin identifying mitigation measures to be funded under section 404. Mitigationrecommendations of the Interagency Hazard Mitigation Teams and the HazardMitigation Survey Teams, which are part of the post-disaster process, assistin early identification of measures to be funded under section 404. Theseand other mitigation plans, programs, and activities within the disasterarea should be coordinated so that the Hazard Mitigation Grant Programcan be used in the most effective manner possible to reduce the potentialfor future losses from natural disasters within the disaster area. In the past, mitigation has been encouraged in a number of ways. First,prior to the enactment of Pub. L. 100-707, section 406 of the DisasterRelief Act of 1974 required State and local governments to evaluate thehazards in the disaster area and take steps to mitigate these hazards.(Section 406 was renumbered in its entirety as section 409 of the StaffordAct pursuant to Pub. L. 100-707.) Section 406 regulations at 44 CFR Part205 Subpart M required State and local governments to prepare and implementhazard mitigation plans as a condition of receiving Federal disaster assistance.(After passage of the Stafford Act, 44 CFR Part 205 Subpart M was reissuedwithout change at 44 CFR Part 206 Subpart M for use in disasters declaredafter the effective date of Pub. L. 100-707, i.e., November 23, 1988.)These plans are due to FEMA 180 days after the declaration. The objectiveof these plans is to encourage the State and local governments to conducta systematic assessment of their mitigation capabilities and to developa long term comprehensive plan or strategy to limit vulnerability to hazards.Hazard evaluation, as it pertains to sections 404 and 409 of the StaffordAct, means an evaluation of State or local vulnerability to natural hazards,rather than hazardous materials, radiological hazards, or other types oftechnological hazards, unless these hazards are a part of the major disasterunder which section 404 funds are made available and are a part of thesection 409 mitigation plan. A key part of the planning process is theFederal/State/local hazard mitigation survey teams which identify immediatemitigation opportunities and long range issues to be addressed in the section409 plan. These survey teams are critical in the early identification ofmitigation measures to be funded under section 404. The mitigation planningrequirement under section 409 of the Stafford Act is particularly importantto the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program because all measures identifiedfor funding under section 404 must be consistent with and a part of theevaluation of hazards conducted under section 409. A second major post-disaster hazard mitigation activity is the InteragencyHazard Mitigation Team activated after flood related disasters. In 1980,the Office of Management and Budget issued a directive to twelve Federalagencies requiring them to coordinate post-flood disaster assistance andrecovery planning and to emphasize nonstructural flood hazard mitigationmeasures, to the greatest extent possible, as part of an effort to minimizeFederal expenditures. The Interagency Agreement for Nonstructural FloodDamage Reduction signed by these agencies created interagency, intergovernmental,and interdisciplinary teams which identify and recommend approaches forrecovery and mitigation actions through the production of a mitigationreport 15 days after the declaration. These interagency teams often identifymitigation issues to be addressed in the State's section 409 hazard mitigationplan, and in the case of flood disasters replace the mitigation surveyteam. A third post-disaster mitigation activity is the mitigation required underthe public assistance program. Historically, FEMA has approached mitigationunder the public assistance program in three basic ways: by requiring disasterassistance applicants to perform mitigation measures as a part of the floodplainmanagement review process; by incorporating mitigation measures into therepair or reconstruction of facilities through existing code requirements;and by allowing a small portion of disaster assistance grants to be usedfor mitigation (formerly referred to as ``disasterproofing'').Under new 44 CFR Part 206 regulations, FEMA has strengthened its emphasison mitigation through the public assistance program. First, cost-effectivehazard mitigation measures identified through floodplain management reviewor by other means, and required by FEMA, are an eligible grant activity.There is no limit on the percentage of the grant amount to be used formitigation so long as the measure is cost-effective. This includes mitigationactions formerly covered under the concept of disasterproofing. Second,FEMA will fund public assistance work necessary to meet code requirementsadopted after the declaration, as well as those in place prior to the disaster,when such standards apply to the type of work being performed. Code requirementscan be adopted after the declaration but must be adopted before projectapproval. Section 404 funding is not to be used to fund any type of mitigationmeasure that might otherwise be eligible under public assistance, thoughsection 404 funding might be used to complement or enhance mitigation fundedunder public assistance. Major provisions of the section 404 interim regulations are outlined below,along with a discussion of key portions of the regulations. 1. The total estimate of Federal assistance available for the Hazard MitigationGrant Program shall be based on 10 percent of the Federal share of theFEMA estimate of all Damage Survey Reports under section 406 of the StaffordAct (public assistance permanent restorative work). Federal contributionscan be up to 50 percent of the cost of the hazard mitigation measures approvedfor funding. _FEMA must determine when the final estimate is set so that a firm figurefor section 404 funding can be established. The final 10 percent figurewill be based on the estimate of the Federal share of all initial approvedDamage Survey Reports (DSR's). Until such time as this figure is known,the State will operate under a FEMA estimate of the amount of funds expectedto be available under section 404. The first estimate will be based onthe preliminary damage assessment, and will be refined as more informationbecomes available from public assistance. Because of the period of monthsover which section 404 projects will be identified, it is not essentialto lock into a final ceiling of funding until a reasonably reliable figurecan be determined. _The full amount of Federal funds available under section 404 is basedon the Federal share of the section 406 grants. Hence, if the section 406grants are 75 percent Federal and 25 percent State funded, total section404 funding will be based on the 75 percent Federal share. Even thoughsection 404 funds are based on a percentage of public assistance funding,the measures funded under section 404 are not limited to measures thatprotect public facilities. Section 404 projects are derived from the fullrange of measures identified in the hazard mitigation plan developed undersection 409. _The law states that the President may contribute up to 50 percent of thecost of hazard mitigation measures. The Federal share of the mitigationmeasures will typically be 50 percent of the cost of the measures, unlessthe State or subgrantees wish to contribute more in order to increase thetotal amount available for mitigation. In no instance will the Federalshare exceed 50 percent or exceed the final 10 percent estimate of section406 funding. Any specific requirements for the cost-share will be establishedin the FEMA-State Agreement. 2. The State is designated as the grantee to which funds are awarded andwhich will be accountable for the use of those funds. State agencies, localgovernments, certain private nonprofit organizations, and Indian tribesare eligible subgrantees. Key State responsibilities for program managementinclude determination of eligible applicants, identification and selectionof projects for which funding is requested, identification of a State HazardMitigation Officer to serve as a point of contact for all program matters,and development of a State administrative plan that outlines proceduresfor administration of the program._In accordance with the ``common rule'' adopted by FEMA at 44 CFR Part13, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreementsto State and Local Governments, States will be given as much flexibilityand authority as possible in the management of the Hazard Mitigation GrantProgram. States will act as the grantee with overall financial and managementresponsibility for the program and will be responsible for all interfacewith the applicants and subgrantees. The State's responsibilities willbe governed by 44 CFR Part 13, by the requirements of 44 CFR Part 206 SubpartN, and by any other pertinent requirements that may apply to grant programs.FEMA will provide technical assistance necessary to implement the program._The State is responsible as grantee for ensuring that applicants meetthe basic eligibility for subgrantees described at andSection; 206.434, andthat applicants receive adequate notification of the availability of andrequirements for funding. Procedures for carrying out these requirementsare to be contained in the State administrative plans for hazard mitigationdescribed under andSection; 206.437. _The State will determine priorities for funding under section 404. Thesepriorities must be consistent with the requirements of Subpart N, withthe State's administrative plan for hazard mitigation, and with the section409 hazard mitigation plan for the disaster. FEMA will work with the Statethrough normal post-disaster mitigation processes to ensure that effectiveand worthwhile mitigation measures are selected for funding. _A key responsibility of the State is to appoint a State Hazard MitigationOfficer (SHMO) with overall program responsibility for the section 404program. The SHMO is also responsible for the development of the section409 plan, which is the tool for identifying mitigation measures to be funded.Though overall program responsibility rests with the SHMO, who typicallyworks in an emergency management or natural resources type of agency, theSHMO must rely on the support and resources of all other key State agenciesthat have a role in mitigation and recovery. The SHMO will work closelywith the FEMA Hazard Mitigation Officer on the implementation of all disasterrelated mitigation programs and activities. _The State must have an approved administrative plan for hazard mitigationin order to receive funding under the section 404 program. The administrativeplan outlines all financial and administrative procedures that the Statewill follow to implement the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. The Plannot only assures FEMA that the State has the capability to manage the program,but establishes essential procedures for the State's interface with FEMAand with the subgrantees. All States are required to develop such a planwithin 180 days of publication of these regulations. The administrativeplan is discussed in greater detail below. 3. The regulation establishes minimum criteria for mitigation measureseligible for funding under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. Any typeof measure is eligible for funding so long as the measure benefits thedisaster area and meets the basic project eligibility established in SubpartN. It is the State's responsibility to identify and select mitigation projects.FEMA has final approval of all measures selected for funding under section404. _Subpart N establishes minimum criteria that all projects must meet inorder to qualify for section 404 funding at andSection; 206.434. A Statemay establish additional criteria through its administrative plan. Thecriteria found in Subpart N are based on the provisions of section 404and on sound mitigation and environmental practices. _The first requirement is that projects must follow an evaluation of hazardsunder section 409. Projects may be identified at any point in the section409 planning process. They may be identified in a previous section 409plan developed by the State, by the mitigation survey team or interagencyteam, or as the State develops the section 409 plan or update for the currentdisaster. Projects may also be identified through other mitigation plansfor the disaster area, such as hurricane, earthquake, dam safety, or landslideplans, or through other mitigation plans that may have been developed forspecific communities. Such plans should be consistent with plans developedunder section 409, and should in fact be considered in the section 409planning process. Because section 409 requires an evaluation of all naturalhazards in the designated area, measures identified in the plan and selectedfor funding do not necessarily need to provide protection from the typeof hazard(s) covered in the declaration, though priority may be given tothose hazard(s). For example, a declaration may be made for tornadoes,high winds, and storms, but if repair and reconstruction is occurring ina flood hazard area, flood hazard mitigation measures may be selected forfunding. _Second, projects must have a beneficial impact on the disaster area althoughthey might not necessarily be located in the disaster area. For example,land treatment and erosion control measures outside of the disaster areamight be funded so long as those measures have a beneficial impact on thedisaster area. A measure may also have an impact beyond the disaster area,such as the adoption of a statewide standard. _Third, the measures must be in conformance with Executive Order 11988and Executive Order 11990; 44 CFR Part 9, Floodplain Management and Protectionof Wetlands; and 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Considerations. The State(through information submitted by the applicant) will need to provide adequateenvironmental information to FEMA so that an environmental assessment ofthe project(s) can be completed. It is expected that the State environmentalagency would be involved in this process, and that the State might followprocedures that have already been established to meet environmental requirementsof other grant programs. _Fourth, projects must solve a problem independently or constitute a functionalportion of a solution where there is assurance that the project as a wholewill be completed. Independent studies which are not intended to resultin a project(s) with measurable cost savings are not eligible. For example,a study to determine the location of debris basins might be funded as partof an overall project to construct debris basins. A study to merely determinethe extent of a hazard in a community would not be eligible. _A key criteria of all measures funded under section 404 is that they becost-effective, and that the measure being proposed is the most cost-effectiveof a range of alternatives. The applicant must demonstrate that the measureis cost-effective, using the broad guidelines provided in andSection; 206.434.To determine cost-effectiveness both benefits and costs must be calculatedon a net present value basis. For the purpose of this calculation applicantswill use the discount rate of ten percent, as established in OMB CircularNo. A-94. Section 404 projects may be of any nature that will result incost-effective protection to public or private property, whether structuralor nonstructural. The list of types of projects contained in andSection;206.434 is by no means exhaustive._Section 404 funds are not intended to be used as a substitute or replacementto fund projects or programs that are authorized by other Federal authorities.In fact, section 404 funds should be considered as a source of last resortwhen seeking mitigation funding. Section 404 funds can be packaged withother Federal, State, local, or private funds to develop a comprehensivemitigation solution. However, section 404 funds are not to be used as thecost-share for other Federal programs, nor are other Federal funds to beused as the cost-share for section 404. For example, if National FloodInsurance Program Section 1362 funds are available to acquire and relocateflood damaged structures, section 404 funds might be used to purchase otherstructures in the area that do not qualify for Section 1362 funding toavoid a checkerboard pattern in the purchase of property. _It is the State's responsibility to identify and select hazard mitigationprojects. Basic selection criteria must be included in the State's administrativeplan, though additional specific criteria might be identified for a particulardisaster. Selection criteria must at a minimum meet the requirements ofandSection; 206.435. The intent of the basic criteria outlined in SubpartN is to ensure selection of the best and most effective mitigation measures.Projects to be selected must be consistent with the section 409 plan, andwill be identified as part of the normal post-disaster mitigation processes,with FEMA providing technical assistance to the State. 4. The Governor's Authorized Representative (GAR) serves as the grant administratorand is responsible for submitting an application to FEMA that containsbasic information on mitigation projects for which funding is requested.In order to take advantage of post-disaster mitigation opportunities, theapplication, which will contain one or more projects, is due within 60days of the disaster declaration. Supplements to the application will besubmitted as additional projects are identified, or as previously approvedprojects are amended. All projects are to be identified within 60 daysof FEMA approval of the section 409 hazard mitigation plan prepared asa condition of receiving Federal disaster assistance. The Regional Directorhas the authority to extend these dates upon submission of adequate justificationfrom the State. _As grantee, the State is responsible for financial and administrativemanagement of the program. This includes providing technical advice andassistance to eligible subgrantees, and ensuring that all potential applicantsare aware of assistance available and submission of those documents necessaryfor grant award. It is critical that the State have sound procedures outlinedin the administrative plan to ensure that all applicants and subgranteesreceive adequate information and fair treatment under the program. _The application, due within 60 days of the declaration, must include aStandard Form 424 and a narrative statement describing each measure forwhich funding is requested, as outlined in andSection; 206.436. The applicationwill identify one or more mitigation measures for which funding is requested.As additional measures are identified or as modifications are made to previouslyfunded measures, supplements to the application will be submitted to FEMA.The intent here is to be consistent with other timelines for applicationsunder disaster assistance, and to encourage applicants to identify thosetypes of mitigation measures that must be implemented quickly before recoverybegins. Based on discussions with FEMA and State staff, it was determinedthat it is reasonable to assume that at least one mitigation measure wouldbe identified within the first 60 days following a declaration, thoughcomments are being sought on the adequacy of this timeframe. It is expectedthat additional mitigation measures will be identified and submitted toFEMA for funding for several months after the declaration, throughout thedevelopment of the section 409 mitigation plan. All supplements for thepurpose of identifying new measures to be funded are to be submitted toFEMA within 60 days of FEMA approval of the section 409 plan. The section409 plan is due 180 days after the disaster declaration, though Statesmay receive an extension of that date if justified. In the past, Stateshave often requested and been granted extensions to the due date of thesection 409 plan, generally up to 1 year after the declaration. Allowingapproximately 1 month for FEMA approval of the section 409 plan, Stateswill typically have 90 days after the completion of the section 409 planto submit new measures for section 404 funding. If justified, the FEMARegional Director can grant extensions to either the application date orthe date of the final supplement for new measures. In setting the deadlinesfor these submissions, FEMA is attempting to strike a balance between encouragingearly identification of mitigation measures that must be implemented beforerecovery begins, and allowing sufficient time to select the most appropriatemeasures contained in the section 409 plan. _Though it is up to the State and to the applicants to identify potentialmeasures for funding, and though the State establishes criteria for selectingprojects to be funded, FEMA does have final approval of funding for allprojects. It is therefore essential that FEMA and the State work togetherclosely throughout the identification and selection process to ensure thatprogram guidelines are being followed and that appropriate and worthwhilemitigation measures are identified. 5. The State must submit an administrative plan outlining the proceduresfor administration of the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program within 180 daysfollowing publication of these regulations. This regulation outlines thepoints which must be addressed in the State administrative plan. Hazardmitigation funding cannot be awarded without receipt and approval of theplan by FEMA. _As grantee, it is essential that the State have an administrative planin place that details financial and administrative procedures for implementationof the program. Funds shall not be awarded under section 404 until a Stateadministrative plan for hazard mitigation has been approved. All Statesare encouraged to develop administrative plans as quickly as possible sothat section 404 funding is not delayed in the event of a disaster. FEMAnow also requires an administrative plan for public assistance under 44CFR Part 206 (54 FR 11610; March 21, 1989). The administrative plans forhazard mitigation and public assistance will have many similarities, particularlyin terms of financial rocedures and grant management. States can use theDisaster Preparedness Improvement Grant (44 CFR Part 300) as a means ofpreparing and keeping these administrative plans up to date. _It is not intended that the plan for hazard mitigation be a lengthy document.The emphasis should be on providing useful guidance to the State on theprocedures necessary to implement the program. At a minimum, the plan mustaddress the criteria outlined in andSection; 206.437. It is expected thatthe administrative plan will become part of the State's overall emergencyresponse or operations plan as a separate annex or chapter. Following eachmajor disaster declaration, the State shall prepare any necessary updates,guidance, or changes in the administration of the program.6. The regulations establish guidelines incorporating the grant managementprocedures of 44 CFR Part 13 and the audit requirements of 44 CFR Part14. The regulations describe how the GAR shall handle cost overruns, progressreports, advance of funds, payment of claims, and appeals. Specific guidanceon allowable project and administrative costs is provided.<ITAG tagnum="15">_As grantee, the State has primary responsibility for project managementand accountability of funds as indicated in 44 CFR Part 13, and is responsiblefor ensuring that subgrantees meet all program and administrative requirements.The procedures needed to accomplish this should be included in the State'sadministrative plan. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Because funding of mitigation measures is based on an estimate ofcosts, it is expected that cost overruns and underruns will occur. Forcost overruns under 10 percent, the GAR has the authority to approve overruns,so long as they are offset by underruns on other projects. If cost overrunsexceed 10 percent of the approved project cost, the GAR must submit a requestwith a recommendation to the Regional Director for a final determination.All problems or circumstances affecting completion dates, scope of work,or project costs that are not consistent with the approved grant conditionsmust be reported to FEMA through quarterly reports. The intent is to allowthe State a reasonable amount of freedom in managing the program and notto burden FEMA with minor adjustments to the projects, while at the sametime providing FEMA an adequate level of information and oversight on aregular basis. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_In accordance with 44 CFR Part 13, and as established in section406 of the Stafford Act, the States and subgrantees are allowed certaincosts in administering the program. Subgrantee administrative expenses,and extraordinary costs incurred by the State, are provided for on a percentagebasis under 44 CFR 206.228, Allowable Cost (public assistance). Costs ofState personnel (regular time salaries only) assigned to administer theHazard Mitigation Grant Program may be eligible when approved by the RegionalDirector as outlined in andSection; 206.439. The staffing pattern for whichfunding is requested must be in accordance with the State administrativeplan. This is another area of the program where it is essential to haveclear and adequate procedures contained within the administrative plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The timelines established for appeals under andSection; 206.440 areconsistent with the timelines established for other disaster assistanceprograms and are in conformance with the Stafford Act. The first levelto which the GAR submits an appeal is the Regional Director, with the AssociateDirector of State and Local Programs and Support as the second and finallevel of appeal.</ITAG>For further information on the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, contactPatricia Stahlschmidt at 202-646-3678.
