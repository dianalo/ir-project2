Amiram Nir reputedly had acted as a go-between in the Iran-Contraarms deal that shook the Reagan administration.   The informed Israeli source, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said Nir was granted the arms license after he resigned from hisgovernment post earlier this year.   ``It was apparently a part of the (resignation) deal,'' thesource said.   The source said it was not known whether Nir actually engaged inarms sales, and quoted Nir as telling friends he wanted to focus on``development projects.''   Israeli officials and Nir's friends and former colleagues deniedthat Nir had a weapons selling license.   Nir advised two Israeli prime ministers on terrorism and was akey figure in the Iran-Contra deal. In Mexico, the 38-year-old Nirsaid he was an avocado exporter.   Nir died in a plane crash Wednesday while flying from Uruapan,about 200 miles west of Mexico City.   In Mexico City, authorities arrested an Argentine who hadidentified Nir's body, an Argentine Consulate source said Monday.Pedro Curchet was arrested for working in Mexico while on a touristvisa, and probably will be deported, the source said on condition ofanonymity.   Avocado grower Carlos Garcia Mendez said Curchet had served as aquality control expert for the Argentine partners in the avocadoexporting firm Eupasa, which has a packing plant in Uruapan. GarciaMendez is also a Eupasa partner.   Investigators cast doubt on the claim that Nir was working as afruit salesman because of his past and because he used an assumedname when renting the plane in which he crashed.   ``Nir did not do much business on agricultural exports,'' theIsraeli source said. ``If this was the case, why did he have to rentthe plane under the name of Pat Weber?''   Israeli Defense Ministry spokesman Eitan Haber said he wasunaware of an arms sales license granted to Nir.   Another Israeli official, who demanded anonymity, denied Nir hada license. ``Nir was a good friend of mine,'' he said, ``and I knowhe was involved in agricultural farms.''   Nir's former colleague Ron Ben-Ishai, military commentator forthe Yediot Ahronot daily, wrote on Sunday that Nir ``was based inLondon and with several European and Israeli businessmen importedfruits and vegetables to Europe.''   Ben-Ishai quoted Nir as telling him six months ago he ``hadenough'' of arms sales during the Iran-Contra affair.   On Monday, Yediot quoted ``sources close to Nir's family'' asdenying the Washington Post report that quoted Nir as saying thatthe counter-terrorist operations he supervised in 1985 and 1986 withformer White House aide Oliver North were authorized by a secretU.S.-Israeli agreement.   Nir was married to Judy Moses-Nir, the daughter of the firsteditor of Yediot.   On Sunday, the daily Maariv quoted North as saying Nir was ``areal Israeli hero. He was an extraodinary courageous man, and he wasmy friend.''   The Post report was denied by Israel and the United States.   But an Israeli expert on the Iran-Contra affair said Monday thatthere were at least two covert operations, codenamed TH-1 and TH-2.   Samuel Segev, author of a 340-page study titled ``The IranianTriangle'', said both operations involved organizing units ofmercenaries to free U.S. hostages held in Lebanon.   His book says that under the TH-2 plan, a secret 43-man unit ofLebanese Druze was created in 1986 to help free American hostages.The plan was dropped when Nir told North there was only a 30 percentchance of success.   Segev, a columnist for the daily Maariv newspaper, told TheAssociated Press his information was based on classified Israeligovernment papers and interviews with key Israeli participants andIranian exiles.</TEXT></DOC>
