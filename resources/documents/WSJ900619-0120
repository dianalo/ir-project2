He may not be agod, but Nelson Mandela, blessed with a double-helping ofcharisma, is certainly an extraordinary idol.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Traveling with Mandela,&quot; marvels Joe Slovo, an ANCcolleague, &quot;is like traveling with Elvis.&quot;   Since his release from 27 years in prison, Mr. Mandela hascovered more ground than the Pope, sweeping through Africa,Europe and now North America. His travels have shown that heis a human being after all. He gets tired often, suffers fromjet-lag and, during a recent pit-stop in Johannesburg, washospitalized for a week of rest and a minor bladderoperation. And, like all human beings, he has ruffled somefeathers. His embrace of Yasser Arafat, the PalestineLiberation Organization chief, irked the world's Jewishcommunity; his tribute to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's&quot;commitment to human rights&quot; raised eyebrows in the West; hisearly talk of nationalization dismayed the businesscommunity.   Still, in the crucial battle for international acclaimbeing waged by all sides in South Africa, the Mandela legend-- the unbowed prisoner refusing to compromise his principles-- prevails. While Mr. Mandela's presence is desperatelyneeded at home to calm the storms of changing South Africa,the ANC also needs him abroad to counter Pretoria's recentdiplomatic offensive.   Last month, South African President F.W. de Klerk traveledthrough Europe and won high praise for his reforms, whichinclude releasing Mr. Mandela, unbanning the ANC and otheropposition groups, lifting much of the state of emergency andmoving toward negotiations on a new constitution based onblack-white power sharing. It was a triumphant tour for agovernment so long shunned by the rest of the world, and Mr.de Klerk returned home confident the Europeans were ready toreview their economic sanctions against South Africa.   But Mr. de Klerk is no Elvis. Last week, Mr. Mandelacampaigned through Europe -- a mass rally here, tea withroyalty there -- and with his refrain, &quot;I still have novote,&quot; effectively recaptured the ground Mr. de Klerk hadwon. (Mr. de Klerk has decided not to challenge Mr. Mandelain the U.S., postponing a visit once scheduled for thismonth.) Mr. Mandela argues that to lift sanctions now, whilethe essence of apartheid remains, would be like &quot;a stab inthe back.&quot; And who, say his colleagues at the ANC, would dosuch a thing to a man who has sacrificed three decades of hislife fighting for racial equality?   &quot;Mr. Mandela is a type of man one doesn't get very often,&quot;says Ahmed Kathrada, who was sentenced to life imprisonmentalong with Mr. Mandela in 1964 and now is the ANC's publicitydirector. &quot;He's an exceptional leader, with ability,charisma, courage and sacrifice.&quot;   Despite the tremendous pressure on his tours -- in theU.S., he will go from a ticker-tape parade to a meeting withPresident Bush to a joint session of Congress to mass ralliesacross the country -- Mr. Mandela is relaxed, as if he hasbeen shaking hands and kissing babies for the past 27 yearsinstead of sitting in jail. When he walks into a room, hisface lights up, offering winks and smiles to all thosepresent. In his speeches, one minute he may quote nurseryrhymes, the next Shakespeare. He has kind words for hisadversary, Mr. de Klerk, and even offers encouragement. Heshows no trace of bitterness.   His trademark is a right fist raised over his head,symbolizing the victories thus far of the anti-apartheidforces. But on this trip, behind the scenes, his hand isoften open and outstretched, soliciting contributions for theANC's work in South Africa.   At home, Mr. Mandela's colleagues are just as busy as heis. &quot;In jail at least we could get some sleep,&quot; says WalterSisulu, Mr. Mandela's 77-year-old colleague who was alsosentenced in 1964.   Mr. Sisulu is heading the efforts to re-establish the ANCas a legal political party inside South Africa, where it hadbeen banned for the past 30 years. To compete with the rulingNational Party, the ANC is scurrying to set up branch officesacross the country, establish a communications and publicitynetwork and begin grassroots canvassing.   It isn't easy, says Mr. Sisulu. &quot;I'm dissatisfied with ourprogress,&quot; he admits. &quot;We're not getting down to the masses.&quot;   As a result, the ANC leadership finds itself reacting toevents more often than shaping them. There are repeated callsto stop the violence in black townships, yet it goes on. Thestudents are told to go back to school to end the blackeducation crisis, but then the teachers go on strike over alack of books and overcrowded classrooms. The government ispressing the ANC to come to consensus more quickly, so thenegotiation process can proceed.   In addition, the released prisoners face the problem ofadjusting to the 1990s. The telephone in his office buzzesand Mr. Sisulu fumbles to hit the right button. Mr. Kathrada,who is 60, says he tried to use a cordless telephone at hishome and then in frustration unplugged it and put it in acloset. He is still battling with his newfangled Gilletterazor, and still trying to solve the mysteries of his pagerand the office fax. He's leaving the computers to the youngergeneration of ANC activitists.   &quot;When we went to prison, computers were the size of aroom,&quot; says Mr. Kathrada.   In an odd way, though, both men say prison helped them andMr. Mandela prepare for their present hectic lives. For onething, they were able to exercise often; Mr. Mandelaexercised for two hours every day. For another, the prisondiet of porridge and meat kept them trim. &quot;No junk food,&quot;says Mr. Kathrada. Then, too, in the last several years ofprison there was regular access to newspapers, and plenty oftime to read them.   But nothing was able to prepare them for the sustainedreception following their release. &quot;I thought that within twoor three weeks the euphoria would be over and we'd be able toestablish ourselves into some sort of normal routine,&quot; saysMr. Kathrada.   The others worry about Mr. Mandela's stamina and health,and he worries about them. But after nearly three decades inprison, none of them is going to slow down now.   Mr. Kathrada laughs as he recalls flying to Cape Town withMr. Mandela on a jam-packed South African Airways plane. Bothof them were looking forward to two hours of quiet work inpreparation for a meeting later that day with Mr. de Klerk.Shortly after takeoff, though, several children approachedMr. Mandela for his autograph. He happily obliged, only tofind a line of children backing up through the plane.   &quot;Nelson had a chat with each child,&quot; says Mr. Kathrada. &quot;Iwas trying to tell him, `Just sign your name,' but he wasn'tsatisfied with that. He had to write a little message,including the name of the child.&quot; It went on like this until20 minutes before landing when the pilot invited Mr. Mandelainto the cockpit.   Mr. Kathrada rolls his eyes. They never did get to theirwork.</TEXT></DOC>
