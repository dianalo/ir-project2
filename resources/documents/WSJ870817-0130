Two months later in Northern California, a little boy got too close to a chained pit bull guarding its owner's marijuana crop and was fatally mauled by the dog, in what emergency-room doctors called &quot;the worst trauma case they had ever seen.&quot;    The latest attack brings the total number of people killed by dogs this year to five -- all five by pit bulls or pit-bull mixes.    Graphic reports of pit bulls running amok have refueled passions in a continuing debate over whether the dogs are vicious land sharks or good dogs with a bad reputation.    Pit-bull defenders react with recitations of their dogs' ideal qualities and accuse the media of fanning the fires of public hysteria. Those defenders, however, cannot deny statistics showing that pit bulls are definitely, and increasingly, over-represented in fatal attacks on people. In the past 18 months, 18 people, mostly children, have been killed by &quot;man's best friend,&quot; 12 of them by dogs identified as pit bulls.    But these statistics alone do not tell the whole story of the much-maligned pit bull.    For one thing, the generic term &quot;pit bull&quot; defies absolute definition. Unlike most pure-bred dogs, which are easily recognizable, the four or more breeds that could be considered pit bulls come in a wide variety of shapes and colors, and range in size from 20 to over 100 pounds. Two hundred years of selective breeding produced an agile dog with powerful jaws and the un-canine quality of gameness -- a willingness to fight to the bloody end. But fighting pit bulls were also painstakingly bred to be docile with people. How else could their handlers pry the combatants apart without losing arms or legs?    Lately though, a new breed of pit-bull fancier has emerged, one which makes the old-time dogfighter look like St. Francis of Assisi. These folks want the baddest dog on earth, and they will do anything to create such a creature.    They steal other dogs and match them against their pit bulls in one-sided contests. In one raid, undercover Humane Society investigators found a dead German shepherd puppy, its jaws taped shut. Dogfighters had used the puppy for training purposes but didn't want their animal scarred. Hideous stories abound of live animals such as kittens or rabbits being presented to pit bulls to bait the dogs and bring out the requisite blood lust.    The pit bulls suffer too. Abusive owners use meanness to produce mean dogs, like the San Diego man who calls his puppies to him and pelts them with rocks when they come. At least 1,500 fighting dogs die every year, and even the toughest survive only a few fights. The not-so-tough are often done away with on the spot by their owners.    Among problem people, the demand for pit bulls increases dramatically after every well-publicized attack. To meet the demand, backyard breeders mass produce puppies for profit with no regard for temperament or the very real possibility of perpetuating a genetic &quot;loose screw.&quot;    &quot;The dogs involved in the latest attacks are all junkyard dogs, not kennel-club dogs,&quot; says Randall Lockwood of the Humane Society of the United States. &quot;Irresponsible people and dangerous dogs are a lethal combination.&quot;    Banning the local definition of a pit bull fails to solve the basic problem -- demented people who use animals for their own cruel ends. The first step to reaching these people is passing and enforcing strict, generic vicious-dog ordinances, like the Rhode Island law that was passed in 1985.    Dog-club members who automatically defend pit bulls need to take some responsibility by insisting that all dogs be bred and socialized for sound temperament. Vigorous enforcement of anti-dogfighting laws, not a high priority so far, is necessary to eliminate the fun and profit of the illegal but flourishing &quot;sport&quot; and the need for aggressive, psychotic pit bulls.    Most important of all, the blame for vicious dogs must be placed where it belongs -- on people. In the past, dogs officially deemed vicious have paid with their lives, while their owners have remained free to acquire, and create, another dangerous animal.    That may -- and should -- change. In Georgia, a man is serving a five-year sentence for manslaughter after his pit bulls tore apart a four-year-old boy.    The final answer lies with the heavy hand of law enforcement. As the Humane Society's Mr. Lockwood says: &quot;It just might work as a deterrent to have the word spread that if you go out of your way to own a vicious dog, and it kills someone, you will go to jail.&quot;    ---   Ms. Calkins is a free-lance writer in San Diego. </TEXT></DOC>
