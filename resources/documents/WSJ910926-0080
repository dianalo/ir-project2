Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6805 marks,down from 1.6870 marks late Tuesday in New York. The U.S.currency also was changing hands at 133.22 yen, down from133.50 yen. Sterling bought $1.7355, up from $1.7285.</LP><TEXT>   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was quotedat 133.30 yen, up from Wednesday's close of 133.22 yen.Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.6815 marks,down from 1.6847 marks.   The White House confirmed Iraq gave United Nationshelicopters unrestricted access to search suspected nuclearweapons sites, eliminating the need for military aircraft toprovide protective cover.   But Iraq continued to detain a U.N. inspection team inBaghdad. The inspectors are holding documents reportedlydetailing Iraq's nuclear weapons program, and SaddamHussein's government is refusing to let the U.N. team leavewith the papers.   U.S. durable goods orders, meanwhile, fell 3.8% in August,less than the 4.8% decline many economists had predicted. Adecline in orders for big-ticket items was widely expectedafter July's record gain, which was revised to 11.7%.   The report provided &quot;a much more hopeful number for theU.S. economy than most people expected,&quot; said GeoffreyDennis, international economist and strategist at James Capelin New York.   After stripping out volatile defense and transportationorders, durable goods orders fell 4.4% in August comparedwith a gain of 5.7% in July, Mr. Dennis said.   The dollar registered its highs in Asia, then moved loweras traders braced for a discouraging report on durable goods.Dealers pushed the dollar up a bit following the report, &quot;butthe market was short overall so that failed and then theytried to sell,&quot; said Christine Allgeier, a corporate adviserat Banque Paribas in New York.   The dollar fell to 1.6750 marks and then bounced off thatlevel. Dealers found interest in buying the dollar on dips,but &quot;it was hard to say if they were buying to go long orbuying to cover short positions,&quot; Ms. Allgeier said. A longposition is a bet the dollar will rise; covering a shortposition is folding a bet the market will fall.   Traders and analysts said the market remains inclined tosell dollars. But a note of caution emerged after Tuesday,when a dollar-selling spree was suddenly halted and reversedby a large purchaser.   Tuesday &quot;wasn't a very good day for a few people&quot; and theydecided to keep a low profile yesterday, said one trader.   Caution is likely to hold the dollar in a narrow rangebetween 1.6750 marks and 1.6900 marks, and between 133.00 yenand 133.50 yen today, dealers said.   But the U.S. currency likely will continue to slip lowerover the medium term. Thomas E. Aspray, an analyst at APMForex Service in Spokane, Wash., said the dollar hasn'tstruck a significant bottom level yet. And &quot;the bearishsentiment seems to be picking up,&quot; he added.   But if political worries give the currency a push through1.7000 marks, the dollar could rally to 1.7200 marks or1.7300 marks, Mr. Aspray said. Players who sold dollarsbetween 1.6800 marks and 1.6900 marks would be forced to buyto cover those positions, he explained.   &quot;The economic news is still consistent with a basicallysoft dollar,&quot; Mr. Dennis of James Capel said. But &quot;thepolitical news is pushing it the other way. You've got thisrather uneasy compromise and the dollar will trade arounduntil it breaks one way or the other,&quot; he added.   The Iraqi standoff is supplying support, but traders viewit as a reason to not sell rather than an excuse to buydollars.   The key factors weighing on the dollar are the U.S.economy's uncertain performance and unfavorable differentialsbetween U.S. and European interest rates. The interest-ratepicture might brighten later this week following reports onGerman and Japanese inflation, Mr. Dennis said.   Data on Germany's inflation rate are expected to show thatthe cost of living fell to 3.9% in the month tomid-September, compared with a 4.1% reading in the priormonth.   A report on Japan's inflation rate, due Friday, also isexpected to show improvement and might induce a long-awaitedinterest cut by the Bank of Japan.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $352.80 an ounce, down 90 cents.Estimated volume was a moderate three million ounces.   In Hong Kong early Thursday, gold was quoted at $352.25 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
