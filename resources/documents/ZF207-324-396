(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Garry RayandM;Structured Query Language (SQL) is one of the hottest areas ofrelational-database design and implementation for almost all computers,including those running MS-DOS.andM;SQL's database programming-language syntax is an ad hoc industry standard forcreating, maintaining and accessing databases across a variety of hardwareand operating-system platforms.andP;  This standardization means that,theoretically, SQL programs can be developed on one platform and executed onanother.andM;Before 1986, SQL implementation was almost exclusively confined tolarge-scale systems such as IBM's 38xx Series and Digital Equipment Corp.'sVAX minicomputers.andM;However, that's changing due to the emergence of local area networks, the SQL''client-server'' model and multitasking operating systems.andM;LANs provide the physical means of segregating a relational database from theapplications that access and manipulate its data.andM;The application can reside on one LAN node and the database on another.andP;  Andthe centralization of the database makes it easier to control data integrity,maintain security and make adjustments to the database software, since only asingle server -- not a legion of disparate PCs -- must be altered at a giventime.andM;In the client-server model made possible by LANs, a PC application running ona local user's system (the client) generates a database request and sends itacross the network to the dedicated database server.andM;There, the server independently executes the PC's SQL request, accesses andmanipulates the database, and returns the result, across the network, to thelocal PC.andM;It sounds simple, but the third part of the equation, multitasking operatingsystems such as OS/2, makes it all possible.andM;With embedded low-level file-protection facilities and protected applicationprocesses, multitasking operating systems allow the server to simultaneouslyprocess database requests from multiple users and multiple applications whilemaintaining the integrity of the central database.andM;The primary benefit of the SQL and relational database combination is ease ofmaintenance.andM;''Relational databases are relatively slow [compared with other databasemodels], but easy to modify.andP;  It takes minutes vs.andP;  days to make a change,''said Mike Arm, a principal analyst at Syscon Corp., a Washington-basedconsulting firm.andM;The design of an underlying database, and of the applications that use it,can have a significant impact upon SQL database performance.andM;''There are so many different variables beyond raw performance,'' explainedBob Zurec, a senior systems engineer with Linc Systems Corp., a consultingfirm in Bloomfield, Conn.andM;''How efficient is the front-end program?andP;  How efficient is the SQL?andP;  And howefficient is the database model?''andM;Front-end programs are an important part of the SQL client-server equation,according to Zurec.andP;  Most common are query applications and report generatorsthat access the database yet shield users from ''raw'' SQL.andM;Another alternative is a set of application-development tools that letprogrammers include ''embedded SQL'' in their own applications.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
