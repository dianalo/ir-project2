The resultscan be summarized as follows: In the evening sky, the line profiles areblue shifted with the original line at small elongation angles. As theelongation angle increases, the blue shift decreases. At some angle between40 and 60{sup 0}, no net shift appears. As the elongation angle increases,the line profile is shifted to red, reaching a maximum red shift somewherebetween elongation angle 120 to 140{sup 0}. At 180{sup 0}, there is alsono net shift. The morning sky is similar to the evening sky, except thatred and blue are interchanged. The line profile is widest at small elongationangles, reaching a relative minimum at a 90{sup 0} elongation angle (bothmorning and evening). A relative maximum in line width is located atabout a 135{sup 0} elongation angle and an absolute minimum at 180{sup0} (opposite the Sun). The location of the various features depends onthe exact parameters used to obtain the distorted line profile. Radiationpressure and orbital eccentricity add more complexity as both could broadenthe scattered line profile and shift it to red in the evening sky.</TEXT></DOC>
