(buyers' guide to products to preventsoftware piracy) (buyers guide)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Watts, Willie.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>There are both software-based and hardware-based ('dongles')methods for preventing the piracy of computer software.andP;  This isillustrated by the products of 16 UK, US and Western Europeanmanufacturers.andP;  Anti-piracy systems are flourishing despite a'journalistic dislike' of them.andP;  Software-based systems aregenerally cheaper and easier to use than dongles but are alsousually considered less secure.andP;  A dongle allows protectedsoftware to run only when the device is plugged into theappropriate parallel or serial port of a computer.andP;  Themanufacturer, functioning and price of each software- orhardware-based anti-piracy product are described.andP;  Userexperiences with each product are briefly noted.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Software ProtectionSoftware PackagesDirectoriesSecurity SoftwareSoftware PiracySoftware SelectionData SecurityComparisonSoftware Publishers.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The Protection Racket My first .EXE article to achieve the coveted status ofCover Feature was a survey of methods of anti-software pirate measures.andP;  WhenI was writing in 1988, protection systems (both software and hardware based)looked to be on the way out.andP;  Lotus had just abandoned protection on 1-2-3.andO;August journals such as Byte and PCW regularly laid into any software housethat dared to present an uncopyable program for review (reflecting, Isuspect, the atypical priorities of the review journalist.andP;  If he has sixdifferent packages to compare, with mutually incompatible softwareprotection, he is much more likely to see red than the punter-in-the-street,who only buys just one, and whose preception of the value of the software isactually increased by having a physical dongle).andM;Since the original article, things have moved on.andP;  The journalistic dislikeof anti-pirate systems may remain, but protection systems flourish.andP;  Theevidence: the pages of this Magazine, which previously contained about one ortwo adverts per issue, now abound with protection systems, to the point wherea certain friend has nicknamed us '.DONGLE' magazine.andP;  My original articlecovered products distributed by just five companies-which was all that Icould find at the time.andP;  In the preparation of this article, I contacted 16manufacturers/distributors, and I am aware of at least one that I was obligedto leave out.andM;I remain in no doubt about the usefulness and validity of protection,including dongles (but see separate box for another view).andP;  The remainingquestion, What sort of protection do I need?,  is more difficult, and isinfluenced by such factors as the retail value and function of your product,the likely ferocity of the attask and the target market.andP;  For example,dongles are very popular with companies exporting software.andP;  Moresurprisingly, some corporates actually prefer that supplies dongle theirsoftware, as a measure to enforce company discipline.andM;Different typesandM;Before considering disk manglers and dongles, a quick reminder of thecomputer-free methods of protection.andP;  If your software comes with a whoppinggreat set of manuals, requires a massive wodge of technical support to set itup and keep it running, and you sell it on a site license basis (or canafford to let customers behave as if you did), it may be that you are alreadyhome.andP;  Smaller manuals may be printed in dark brown ink on light brown paper:this not only gives them a fashionable, ecological look but also defeatsphotocopiers.andM;The next step up is probably software-based protection.andP;  This generallyconsidered less secure than a hardware device, but it is usually cheaper, andcertainly less hassle.andP;  Software protection typically works by encrypting the.EXE file that you wish to protect.andP;  The decryption routines are usually tiedinto a unique (we hope) feature of the customer's machine; his hard disk'finger-print' (for example, a table of disk flaws), a floppy key disk, oreven the timing characteristics of the machine's electronics.andP;  Because it ispossible to store encrypted data relating to the program, software protectionin this form can be very versatile.andP;  You can create demo versions whichrefuse to run after six goes, or after the Ides of March, but which spring tolife when a password (exchanged for folding currency) is typed into theprogram.andM;His est dongleandM;From software-based protection, all roads lead to dongle.andP;  Just in case somedoesn't know, a dongle is a device which plugs into your computer.andP;  Theprotected software will only run if it is there.andP;  The dongle is convenientfor the customer.andP;  He is free to make backups.andP;  to run your program on adifferent machine, he has merely to unplug the dongle in one place and plugit in elsewhere.andM;Modern dongles are mostly designed to fit on the parallel printer port,although some are available for serial ports and PC/XT bus compatible slots.andO;These days, they are all transparent, ie it is possible to connect thembetween a computer and a printer without affecting communications.andP;  They aremostly cascadable (you can connect two or more to the same port without theminterfering with each other), and, in practice, dongle conflict is a rareproblem.andP;  Where it occurs, it can be solved by the purchase of a cheapprinter port card.andP;  Dongles are reliable beasts-none of the users that Iinterview repoted unacceptable failure rates or compatibility problems,although there was an occasional printer or lap-top computer (which oftenunderpower their ports) that gave a little trouble.andM;Dongles function in many different ways.andP;  Simple dongles return a single,fixed code number.andP;  Some dongles return a stream of pseudo 'random' numbers,similar to that provided by high-level languages' random number generators.andO;More sophisticated dongles yet allow you to 'seed' the random sequence, thuscreating a dialogue between software and hardware.andP;  There are also dongleswhich encrypt data sent to them and a popular innovation this, dongles whichcontain a few bytes of read/write memory.andP;  This memory can be used to storethe same sort of information as encrypted data of software-based protection;for example the particular configuration of your software.andM;Dongles are generally supplied tailored to your code or range of codes, sothat nobody else's dongle can ever match yours.andP;  For some types of dongle youcan acquire a customisation kit which lets you set up some of the internalcodes, enabling you, for example, to mark dongles as 'demonstration' or 'fullapplication'.andM;The manufacturers also offer different methods of linking the dongle to yoursoftware.andP;  At worst, they tell you the necessary port numbers and leave youto get on with it.andP;  The best systems offer a program which encrypts .EXEfiles (as with software protection) and provide a suitable calling interfaceand object module for your development language.andM;What is available?andM;Faced with 16 distributors (some labelled with phrases like: 'We challengedthe entire Maths and Computing department of Harvard University to crack ourproduct; after three months they admitted defeat'), and given two weeks inwhich to review them and edit the magazine before you, I had to cheat.andP;  Thecomments on protection given above, and many of the observations that follow,were mostly supplied by real customers of the companies, who I have beencalling up.andP;  Many thanks for their help.andP;  To keep this article down to size,I have concentrated on one product per distributor.andP;  The companies are listedin 'Leslie Halliwell' alphabetical order.andM;BL Security LtdandM;Main Product: Deadlock I.andP;  Parallel port dongle, is accessed via 16 bytepassword, and contains 16 bytes of memory.andP;  Password and memory can be set upby user, using a special programming device (155[pounds]) - 8 reprogrammingsallowed.andP;  It is not possible to alter the dongle's memory 'on the fly'.andO;Programmer incorporates calls to dongle in his code; dongle is accessed viasupplied standard object module - the latter is encrypted with dataidentifying the programmer device used to set it up, for extra security.andO;About a dozen standard MS-DOS interfaces supplied.andM;Unit Price 5-20 16.50[pounds], 30-70 13.75[pounds], 100-500 9.75[pounds],700+ 7.50[pounds].andP;  The supplier wishes it to be known that prices for the'gaps' in the bands are negotiable.andP;  BL Security is also running a promotionuntil the end of 1990, where all orders for 50+ units are priced at7.50[pounds] each.andM;Other information: This product and company are quite new, no user dataavailable on quality of support.andP;  Dongle manufactured in Israel, originallydeveloped for Israeli MOD.andP;  Other products in the range include a moresophisticated dongle with read/write memory, and a software utility that'donglises' applications automatically.andP;  Existing users chose dongle becauseof good value for money, and small size of operation (seen as virtue becausedongle less likely to have been cracked).andP;  Contact 081 343 0734.andM;Brent Communication ATCandM;Main Product: Maxpro.andP;  Parallel port dongle, with read/write memory.andO;Dongle's memory may be programmed 'on the fly', and contains 6 bytes ofgeneral puropose memory, but much more formatted to support special features.andO;Software supplied with package encrypts MS-DOS program file in the style ofsoftware-based copy protection; this system must be used - no languagebindings are provided.andP;  As with some software-based copy protection, thismeans that you can't use overlays internal to the .EXE file (because theoverlays will not be decrypted when loaded).andP;  Encryption program is veryfull-featured; for example it is possible to create 'evaluation' programswhich cease to run after a date/number of runs/duration of running, but whichthe customer can re-enable by entering a password (supplied in exchange forhis credit card number).andP;  The dongle also can detect attempts to hack it, andcontains 'tamper links'.andP;  If one of these is broken, the unit will cease tooperate and must be returned to the supplier for resetting.andM;Unit Price: 1-49 30[pounds], 50-99 25[pounds], 100+ 20[pounds].andP;  Alsorequired: a copy of the dongle-programming software - 65[pounds].andM;Other information: UK made -Maxpro was originally produced to meet an inhouseneed.andP;  It is reputed to offer an unusually high level of security.andP;  Thephilosophy of Brent's auto-encryption process is that Brent has had much moretime to study the techniques of creating hacker traps, and so will be muchbetter at it than the ordinary application programmer.andP;  Brent's salesapproach is unusual: discovering dongle (the advanced Softlok model, qv),Brent stated that it could break the protection.andP;  The challenge wasaccepted...andP;  and the software was cracked in a few hours.andP;  The victimssubsequently switched to Maxpro.andM;Brent also offers a range of more 'conventional' dongles, both with andwithout memory, which may be accessed by drivers in the usual way.andP;  Contact0423 566972.andM;Bristol Software FactoryandM;Main Product: The Software Key, a serial port dongle, provides streams ofpseudo-random numbers (seedable), which can be sampled to provide a passwordor used to encrypt protected data.andP;  Some example code to access the dongle isprovided (GW-BASIC, Microsoft C for MS-DOS and OS/2, Turbo Pascal V3.0-V4.0),but the manual encourages the user to write his own - on the basis that theabsence of a standard driver will create more difficualties for the hacker.andM;Unit Price: 20-99 33[pounds], 100-499 31.50[pounds], 500-999 30[pounds],1000+ 28.50[pounds]andM;Other information: UK-made, customers include Racal and Hewlett-Packard.andP;  Thedongle is unusually large (over 11 cm in length) - this has led to somecomplaints from end-users: 'I can't push my machine clos enough to the wall'etc.andP;  The stream of random numbers provided by the hardware provides thepotential for well-protected systems; but the onus is on the user to set itup - I heard two accounts of software protected with this dongle beinghacked.andP;  The standard and quantity of documentation/software is perhaps alittle disappointing; however existing users expressed satisfaction with thelevel of support offered.andP;  Contact 0272 629790.andM;ClearsoftandM;Main Product: Microphar Memory Key, a parallel port dongle, with 62 bytes ofread/write memory.andP;  Access via encrypted object modules which must be linkedto application.andP;  Vast assortment of high-level languages explicitlysupported, including oddballs such as Metaware C, Baby 36 etc.andP;  Works underMS-DOS, SCO Xenix, P-System (UCSD Pascal), OS/2 and PROLOGUE (who?).andO;Interrupt vector 1 andamp; 3 blocking utility plus various other anti-debuggersoftware supplied.andM;Unit Price: 10-29 39[pounds], 30-49 36[pounds], 50-99 35 pounds], 100-19930[pounds], 200+ 28[pounds].andM;Other information: French made.andP;  Product range well-established on Continent,comparatively new to UK market.andP;  Customer reported delivery time: about twoweeks.andP;  UK support was rated very good - for example, an extra component wassupplied free to solve a particular problem.andP;  Some compatibility problemswith laptops.andP;  No manual available yet - it is being written.andM;Company supplies several other dongles, including an 'all-purpose' serialport dongle, for use on workstations, minicomputers etc.andP;  Contact 091 3789393.andM;ComsecandM;Main Product: KeyPro, a parallel port dongle, with about 10 bytes ofread/write memory.andP;  Access via encrypted object modules which must be linkedto application, or via automatic modification of .EXE file with KPINST.andO;Example code supplied for four high-level languages (MS-DOS).andP;  Dongle hasmetal (shielding) case.andM;Unit Price: 1-10 33[pounds], 11-25 31[pounds, 35[pounds], 26-4929.70[pounds], 50-100 28.05[pounds], 100-500 26.40[pounds].andM;Other information: British made.andP;  Comsec is a well-established company, butthe KeyPro product is a relatively recent innovation - so the customers thatI interviewed had not had much experience with it.andP;  Comsec's support is ratedhighly.andP;  Order turn-around was 1-3 weeks.andM;Comsec has other dongles as well as Keypro and the serial port dongle,unusually including an internal PC bus dongle.andP;  Contact 0234 751203.andM;Control Telemetry LtdandM;Main Product: Model 521, a serial port dongle, returning simple, fixed code.andO;Access via link to non-encrypted object module, for which assembler source isprovided, or automatic modification of .EXE file with Zareba program.andP;  A goodselection of high-level language bindings, including some quite obscureofferings (including some rare-ish FORTRANs).andP;  MS-DOS only.andP;  Documentation isvery extensive.andP;  A separate programmer is available (186[pounds]), to allowthe software developer to customise (partially) the dongle's internal code.andM;Unit Price: 10-99 40[pounds], 100+ 35[pounds].andM;Other information: British made.andP;  This dongle is virtually the grand-daddy ofthem all (manual makes references to Sirius/Victor machines etc).andP;  This meansthat the technology may be simple and long-in-the-tooth but, on the otherhand, it has also been well-tested.andP;  One CTL customer commented that hethought that the 521 was probably overpriced, but he remained faithful on a'better the devil you know' basis.andM;CTL has other dongles, including the recently-announced 527, which is aprogrammable parallel port unit.andP;  Contact 071 328 1155.andM;The Data BusinessandM;Main PRoduct: Minder software-based protection system.andP;  Disk based system;user can operate software with distribution disk acting as key disk, or moveprotection to hard disk.andP;  Protection of individual programs is accomplishedby running a utility which encrypts the .EXE file.andP;  Unusually, you need tobuy each key disk (ie protected copy) individually; there is no 'infinitelives' version of the program.andP;  If you restrict the user to key disk styleoperation, you can link in a run-time module which may be called at intervalsto verify the presence of the key - otherwise it is only checked once atstart-up.andP;  Documentation was being revised at time of writing.andM;Unit Price: 10-90 key disk 6[pounds] to 8[pounds] (for 360 KB to 1.44 MB),100+ key disks 3[pounds] to 4 pounds].andP;  'Metered' disks are available forcommercial duplicators, this would probably work out cheaper.andP;  One offpurchase of basic utility (99[pounds]) is also necessary, the runtime moduleis extra (29[pounds]).andM;Other information: Minder has been in existence for five years, and has beendistributed by various different companies.andP;  Originally owned by WayDisk, TheData Business acquired the copyright in July 1990.andP;  Level of security is notclear; one ex-user (who I rang up regarding another system) abandoned Mindersome time ago after his application was hacked.andP;  However, revisions areissued from time to time, so the situation may have improved.andP;  Thecomplicated pricing structure, based on add-on modules and copy counts, seemsfussy and old-fashioned.andP;  Contact 0865 842224.andM;Data Encryption Systems LtdandM;Main Product: Deskey DK12, a parallel port dongle, which provides a stream ofpseudo-random numbers.andP;  Access automatic modification of .EXE file withDESlock program; or via user-written driver -BASIC and assembly languageexamples are provided.andP;  Documentation is clear but thin.andM;Unit Price: 10-24 26[pounds], 25-99 24[pounds], 100-499 22 pounds], 500-99920[pounds], 1000+ 18[pounds]andM;Other information: British made.andP;  Users report that the DK12 is much morerobust and reliable than predecessors - a previous model was sensitive to theprinter attached to it.andP;  Support rated highly.andP;  Order turn-around usuallyabout two weeks, but can be one day in an emergency.andM;Serial and bus versions of the dongle are also available, these are alsobased on the random number principle.andP;  Contact 0278 653456.andM;Empiric LtdandM;Main Product: MemoHASP, a parallel port dongle, with about 500 bytes ofread/write memory.andP;  Access via automatic modification of .EXE file withHASPINST program and linkable object module (manufacturer recommends bothapplied).andP;  Fair selection of high-level language bindings, plus 'generic' TSRdriver for use by unsupported languages.andP;  Additional 'Pattern Code Security'feature is included to make the application code harder to hack.andO;Documentation is very professional.andM;Unit Price: 1-9 45[pounds], 10-24 40.50[pounds], 25-49 39 37[pounds] 50-7438.25[pounds], 79-99 37.12[pounds], 100-150 36 pounds], 150+ 33.75[pounds]andM;Othe information: Users report variation in performance of units, iesometimes a given unit will fail to work with one particular machine.andO;Turn-around on orders was less than one week.andM;Empiric also supplies a non-programmable version of this dongle.andP;  Contact0628 35913.andM;Link computersandM;Main Product: Cop's Copylock II software-based protection system.andP;  Protectioncan operate either as a 'key-disk' system or installed onto a hard disk.andP;  Inthe latter case, the program works by measuring certain aspects of the hostmachine: tolerances of motherboard components, floppy disk controllers etc.andO;This enables user to backup, reformat hard disk and restore software withoutneeding protection moving facilities.andP;  However, if he replaces the HDC, he'sstuffed.andP;  Copylock is added to programs by modification of .EXE files - noprogramming is required.andP;  Facilities are provided for making Demo versions(with limited number of runs), automatically generating Serial Numbers etc.andO;The documentation is excellent.andM;Unit Price: Standard version 600[pounds] (key disk only), Automatic version1200[pounds] (installable on machine).andP;  One-off payment, allows theprotection of as many disks as you like.andM;Other information: Danish product.andP;  Lotus is evaluating the system.andP;  Userreports suggest that Copylock is very secure.andP;  However, two individualscomplained about its sensitivity to hardware.andP;  Apparently, it refuses toinstall on some machines, especially portables.andP;  Once in place, theprotection sometimes fails after a few minutes, when the machine warms up, orafter a few weeks, when the characteristics of the machine change with age.andO;The program can be 'tuned' to be less sensitive...in which case theprotection breaks down between machines of the same model.andP;  Another complaintis that there is no method of deinstallation, to allow an application to bemoved between machines.andP;  Contact 0763 263 073.andM;MagnifeyeandM;Main Product: Hardlock E-Y-E, a parallel port dongle, contains asophisticated encryption algorithm - potentially very secure.andP;  Access viaautomatic modification of .EXE file with HL-Crypt program and linkable objectmodule (manufacturer recommends both applied).andP;  About 16 high-level languagebindings supplied.andP;  Documentation and presentation the best of any productdescribed here, by about one order of magnitude.andP;  A separate programmer cardis available (price 50 pounds] which allows customisation of dongles bysoftware house.andM;Unit Price: 1-49 34 pounds, 50-99 31 pounds, 100-199 28 pounds, 200-499 26poundsandM;Other information: German made.andP;  Very high quality product.andP;  Dongle is verysmall (less than 5 cm long) - ideal for lap-tops.andP;  Users report deliverytimes of less than one week.andP;  The 'E-Y-E' in its name refers to a transparentpanel on top of the unit, through which the ASIC chip on which the dongle isbased can be seen.andM;The dongle is also available with a 128 byte memory, and as an XT bus card.andO;Contact 071 221 8024.andM;MicrocosmandM;Main Product: CopyControl software-based protection system.andP;  Disk-basedMS-DOS system.andP;  Protection is achieved by automatic modification of the .EXEfile by the CCADD utility, or by linking  in and calling an object module.andO;CopyControl is very full-featured, offering the ability to create demoversions (software stops working after a number of runs, or after a givendate), remote upgrades (by supplying a password), choice of permitted numberof working copies, usable movable protection and so on.andP;  A LAN version (120pounds extra) allows the restriction of the number of simultaneous users on anetwork.andM;Unit Price: 3 pounds per disk + 50 pounds for the initial kit.andP;  An 'infinitecopies' version is available for 419 pounds.andM;Other information: British product.andP;  This is the current choice of one user,who has struggled with Minder and Cop's Copylock (both qv).andP;  His onlyremaining complaint is that it is not yet possible to inspect the status ofthe copy protection on a returned disk - but Microcosm is working on it.andM;For more details of the protection system see Peter Cheesewright's article onpage 28 in this issue.andP;
