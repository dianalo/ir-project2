MaryStiller West Lafayette, INandM;Bob: Many of us have experienced this problem, and it's easy to solve with afreeware INIT called IconWrap, written by Ken McLeod.andP;  I've used it foryears.andP;  Just drop it into your System Folder, and reboot.andP;  Voila--the iconsautomatically go into two rows.andM;Andy: I use IconWrap, too ...andP;  it's great.andP;  But gee, Bob, I sure do wonderwhere our readers can get their hands on public-domain and shareware softwareandM;....Bob: I guess they'll have to read the next letter ....andM;Where's Layout?andM;Q.andP;  In your July '90 column (page 251), you described a public-domainapplication called Layout 1.9 by Mike O'Connor.andP;  I don't have a modem, so Ican't download shareware from Zmac.andP;  Where can I order this? Myra SeifertEugene, ORandM;Bob: The author doesn't sell copies of Layout, but it is widely availablefrom on-line services and user groups.andP;  If you don't have a local user group,you can try the BMUG (Berkeley Macintosh User Group) software library, one ofthe most complete in the country.andP;  It offers a catalog of programs (it cost$8 the last time I checked) and sells disks for $4 each, including postageand handling.andP;  the BMUG folks are among the nicest, most knowledgeable Macusers I know, and they're a pleasure to do business with.andP;  If you don't havea local user group, you might consider joining BMUG just to get itsnewsletter -- a semiannual 300-to-400-page extravaganza.andM;BMUG can be reached at 1442A Walnut St., #62, Berkeley, CA 94709-1496andgt; (415)549-2684.andM;Andy: Don't forget the BCS-Mac (Boston Computer Society Macintosh) Group.andO;Not to smear BMUG, Bob, but at the last Boston Expo, it held a big &quot;Salute toNonbiodegradables&quot; party.andP;  BMUG members went all over town collecting moundsof plastic and Styrofoam and then threw it into the dolphin tank at the NewEngland Aquarium.andP;  Kind of a black mark against BMUG, if you ask me.andM;Bob: That's a lie, and you know it]  How can you promote a group such asBCS-Mac, whose greatest cultural achievement is the invention of MacintoshJeopardy?andM;Andy: Well, anyway.andP;  BCS-Mac also has a nice fat PD catalog and a greatmonthly magazine.andP;  It's located at 48 Grove St., Somerville, MA 02114andgt; (617)625-7080.andM;Bob: Those of you who hate Massachusetts and California can call (800)538-9696 for the name of your local Mac user group.andP;  Most of 'em sellshareware disks.andM;Printer Care and FeedingandM;Q.andP;  How do I know whether a certain material--labels, transparencies, or cardstock -- is safe to feed through a LaserWriter? Andrew Rosa Brooklyn, NYandM;Andy: The safest way is to feed it through someone else's LaserWriter first.andM;Seriously, three hazards face a sheet of (fill in the blank) as it meandersthrough the LaserWriter's intestines.andP;  First, the page makes a U-turn as ittravels from the paper bin into the printing mechanism.andP;  If the page is asheet of labels, some stickers may peel off while making the turn and getstuck among the innards of the machine.andP;  The solution is to feed the pagemanually to avoid the U-turn.andM;Problem 2 is page thickness.andP;  By exhaustive experimentation (that is, byfeeding progressively thicker stock through a pal's printer until a savagepaper jam occurred), I determined that 60-pound cardboard (business-cardstock) is the thickest stuff that can make it through unscathed.andM;Finally, there's heat from the fusion rollers at the end of the paper path.andO;It can turn a happy sheet of transparency material into a hard glob ofplastic nastiness that's terminally fused to the printing mechanism.andP;  Becausethe lowest temperature of the heat rollers is typically about 150 degrees,you can test a sheet of material by setting an iron to 140 degrees or so andpassing it over the sheet a few times.andP;  If the iron becomes permanentlyfastened to the ironing board, well, you have the answer.andM;Bob: Most office-supply stores sell special labels and transparency film foruse with plain-paper copiers, which are very similar to laser printers.andP;  I'vehad good results with Avery 5351 labels and Scotch 503 transparency film.andM;Print from the Finder?andM;Q.andP;  Can you print a document directly from the Finder without opening it?andO;Harold Rhoda Marlboro, NJandM;Andy: Just select the document, and use the Print command on the Finder'sFile menu.andP;  The Finder will run whatever application created the file andprint that sucker right out.andP;  This is really useful if you have a wholefolder full of documents you want to print.andP;  If you select them all and printfrom the Finder, many applications, such as Word, will show you only onePrint dialog box and then print the documents in succession.andM;Bob: You must have a copy of the correct application on a mounted disk, ofcourse, or you get the dreaded &quot;the application is busy or missing ...&quot; errormessage.andP;  And you can't select two files from different applications--thisworks with only one application at a time.andP;  And many applications, such aWord, won't let you print from the Finder if the application is already open.andM;Digital PhotographyandM;Q.andP;  Help]  I work for a small newspaper that is produced almost entirely onthe Mac except for two phases of the operation -- the photography andprinting the actual newsprint version.andP;  We don't expect Macs to print thenewspaper (yet), but we think they can bypass the drudgery of chemicalsandgt;filmandgt; and the rest of the time-consuming, mysterious, arcane,never-the-same-results-twice-in-a-row darkroom process.andM;We know that digital cameras are available.andP;  Which ones can you suggest, howdo we find them, and how do we get the image from the camera's viewfinderinto our PageMaker layouts so that it's suitable for printing on aLaserWriter IINT? George Ziemann Bullhead City, AZandM;Bob: It can be done, but it won't be cheap -- plan on spending severalthousand dollars to install a complete digital photo/halftoning system.andM;Digital cameras are available from several manufacturers -- Canon, Panasonic,and Sony are probably the best known.andP;  These cameras use non-standard 2-inchdisks, which can hold between 25 and 50 pictures.andP;  Most digital camerasrequire a separate playback unit for viewing the photos.andP;  Prices for completesystems start at around $1,000.andM;Frame-grabber cards, which convert video signals into TIFF or PICT files, areavailable from RasterOps, Mass Micro Systems, Aapps, and several othermanufacturers.andP;  For added functionality, you can input images from a videocamera into a graphic file or use a frame grabber to convert a frame ofvideotape.andP;  You can get a frame grabber for less than $1,000.andM;Finally, you'll need some image-editing software such as Photoshop, DigitalDarkroom, or ImageStudio.andM;Before you invest in a digital system, I suggest you look long and hard atsome samples of work done with similar components.andP;  Although you might beable to attain results that are comparable to conventionaldarkroom/halftoning outputting to a high-resolution imagesetter (1,000 dpi ormore), I suspect you'll find that you can't even come close with a 300-dpiLaserWriter.andM;Andy: Another big problem with electronic photography is that it's still apretty new field.andP;  The electronic cameras I've seen are great for snapshotsbut aren't nearly as capable as their traditional counterparts.andP;  A bettersolution would be to take pictures with a traditional camera and then scanthem in with a good 256-gray-level scanner.andP;  That should get you your elusiveAll-Electronic Newspaper.andM;I should warn you, though, that all the Big-Time Professional Graphic ArtistsI know advise against the use of scanned photos in publications.andP;  Theycontend that scans don't print as well as traditionally halftoned photos, andlooking at the results, I have to agree.andM;Phone Cables for theandM;KeyboardandM;Q.andP;  Can I use a regular telephone hand-set cord to replace my Mac Pluskeyboard cable? Greg Kaplow San Jose, CAandM;Andy: No -- a pre-ADB keyboard cable can serve as a handset cord but not viceversa.andP;  Given Apple's recent bout of litigiousness, the Phone Company isunderstandably afraid of being sued by Apple for infringing on its patents.andM;A standard handset cord works if you rewire it, though.andP;  Just swap thecolored wires at each end so that the yellow wire runs to the black wire andthe green wire goes to the red wire (see Figure 1).andM;The only caveat here is the length of the cord.andP;  The absolute limit seems tobe 10 feet: Use a 12-foot cord, and you'll find that keystrokes keep droppingout during the long journey from the keyboard to the Mac.andM;Bob: How do you figure stuff like that out, Andy?andM;Andy: No comment, except that it gets real boring when both your CD playerand your TV are in the shop at the same time.andM;X Rays and Your DisksandM;Q.andP;  Is it safe to allow my diskettes to be scanned by an airport X-raymachine? Rene Dubilard Paris, TXandM;Andy: If you ask an airline, it'll tell you (without hesitation) thatsecurity equipment has absolutely no adverse effects on magnetic media.andP;  Sofar so good.andP;  But then, these people also tell you that your 8:00 A.M.andO;flight will leave promptly, so I thought some experimentation was in order.andM;I formatted 20 disks, filled them with Lotus spreadsheets and HyperCardstacks (so any damaged files wouldn't be a real loss), and separated theminto five envelopes of four floppies each.andP;  One envelope stayed home as acontrol.andP;  The other four accompanied me to Logan International Airport inBoston and were run through an X-ray machine one, two, three, or four times.andO;The exciting results are summarized in Figure 2 (please ...andP;  no wagering)..andM;Clearly, you shouldn't trust your floppies to airport-security machines.andP;  (Atleast not the ones at Logan.andP;  In my Never-Ending Quest for Truth, I am, ofcourse, prepared to undertake a 20-city junket of airports, at MacUser'sexpense ....)andP;  the same caution should apply to hard-disk drives as well.andM;But fear not for the safety of your data whilst traipsing through airports.andO;As an airline employee told me (as I brought her line to a standstill withthe preceding disk follies), &quot;It is every American's right to request handinspection.&quot;andP;  Simply put your hard-disk drive and your floppies into aseparate bag, and allow 20 minutes for the procedure.andP;  In general, you'll beexpected to fieldstrip your bag and prove that your drive works by pluggingit in and starting it up.andM;While we're on the subject of data predators, the antitheft systems in publiclibraries and bookstores are unlikely to blitz your data.andP;  But beware of thedesensitizing machines at checkout stands]  These machines (decorated withfestive &quot;DO NOT PLACE CREDIT CARDS ON THIS MACHINE]&quot; stickers) containpowerful electromagnets.andM;Bob: Don't be so quick to condemn X rays.andP;  I've heard the magnets in themotors that run the conveyor belts in airport security systems are theculprit, not the X rays.andP;  Although you haven't exactly proven that X rays areharmful, it's quite clear that X-ray machines are bad for disks.andM;I've always asked for a hand-inspection of my floppies and hard-disk drives,so it's nice to know that all that hassle was worthwhile.andM;From Works 1.1 to 2.0aandM;Q.andP;  I had Microsoft Works version 1.1 for some time and created a lot oflists and files with it.andP;  When I got version 2.0a, I installed it on myhard-disk drive and kept it along with version 1.1 I'd like to transfer allthe information created with the first version into the new one, but I can'tseem to find any information about this in the manual.andP;  I called Microsoft,but you know how that is.andP;  The person I spoke with quickly explained howsimple it is, but I still can't figure out how to do it.andP;  Can you help?andM;Another thing: I read your info on memory upgrades with interest (June '90,page 299).andP;  When I heard about System 7.0, I upgraded my Plus to 4 megabytesof RAM.andP;  OK, but what do I have now?andP;  Aside from the ability to run System7.0 (which will require at least 2 megabytes of RAM), what does the upgradedo for me?andP;  I don't understand the RAM cache and was told not to mess withit.andP;  Because I plan to use HyperCard and PageMaker to keep extensive recordsand write a book, I thought increasing the RAM would be a good idea.andP;  Was it?andO;Henry Anton Meriden, CTandM;Bob: Microsoft was right--it's simple.andP;  First launch version 2.0a.andP;  Now usethe Open command on the File menu to open any file you created with version1.1.andP;  Once the file is open, select Save from the File menu.andP;  That's it]  Thefile is now in Works 2.0a format.andM;If you want to save a copy in Works 1.1 format for any reason, use the Saveas command rather than Save.andP;  Give the newer file a different name.andP;  (If theoriginal file was called Max, for example, name the new file Max.v2.)andM;As far as the additional RAM goes, use it to run HyperCard and PageMakersimultaneously under MultiFinder.andP;  That way you can have both programs openand copy and paste between them without having to quit one and open theother, which you would have to do with only 1 megabyte of RAM.andM;Andy: The other advantage to having great big wheelbarrows full of RAM isthat you can run as many INITs and cdevs as you want -- within reason.andP;  With1 megabyte, you have to be stingy to ensure that porky programs such asPageMaker and SuperCard can run (even alone), but with 2 or 4 megabytes underthe hood you can toss ATM, SoundMaster, and Oscar into the System Folderwithout worrying about running out of memory.andM;Laser SmearingandM;Q.andP;  This is a simple problem, or should be, but I haven't gotten an answerfrom my Apple dealer, print shops, or stationery stores.andP;  I have aLaserWriter IINT and find the toner used in the cartridges smears on somepaper and most kinds of card stock.andP;  How can I find out which kind of paperaccepts the toner?andP;  Some fairly expensive envelopes I printed came outunusable because the address rubbed right off, yet similar envelopes,actually identical to the naked eye, worked fine.andP;  David Parry Los Angeles,CAandM;Bob: When selecting paper that won't smear, stay away from coated stocks andother glossy papers.andP;  Toner doesn't adhere well to them.andP;  I've found thatinexpensive copier paper works well for everyday stuff, and more-expensivepaper (such as Hammermill Laser Plus or Laser Print) that's designed forlaser printers gives excellent results for more-important work such ascamera-ready copy.andM;If you must use envelopes and paper that are hostile to laser toner, go to anart-supply store and buy a can of spray fixative, the stuff artists sprayonto charcoal or pastel drawings to keep them from smearing.andP;  I use theKrylon brand, but I suspect that any spray fixative can work as well.andP;  Afterprinting the envelopes, pick them up carefully and spray the printed areawith a very light mist.andP;  That ought to do it.andM;Andy: I've heard that hairspray can also do the trick, but I haven't had achance to try it.andP;  My hair-care arsenal consists of whatever shampoo's onsale at K-mart.andM;Save the Screens?andM;Q.andP;  I've heard that screen savers, such as After Dark and Pyro], can protectmy screen from getting burned-in images after the computer idles for longperiods of time.andP;  Do I really need this type of program to protect my screen?andO;Couldn't I simply turn the brightness all the way down? Clint WokerOkawville, ILandM;Bob: If you can remember always to turn down the brightness when you leaveyour computer, then, no, you don't need a screen saver.andP;  The beauty of screensavers is that they never forget.andP;  You decide how long you want your computerto sit idle before the screen saver kicks in.andP;  After that, the screen saverremembers for you.andP;  That's not the only reason to buy one, though: Screensavers are really cool looking (see Figure 3).andM;Andy: It's the old shirt-versus-suit struggle.andP;  The college guys in T-shirtscan say, &quot;Wow ...andP;  it's useless but it puts bodacious fireworks onto thescreen]&quot;  The corporate executives, on the other hand, have to explain totheir bosses that it &quot;prevents costly burn-in&quot; (which happens only if youleave the screen on for, like, a whole month) and that it's a clever&quot;office-productivity solution,&quot; and so on--if they don't want to get fired.andM;I've also heard of office managers going berserk at the sudden appearance offireworks, fish, or flying toasters on-screen: &quot;VIRUS] EEEEEEEK]]]  IT'S AVIRUS]]]  FORMAT THE HARD DRIVE]]]&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
