The federal government agreed on Monday to examine results of the1990 census and adjust them if necessary to correct a historicalundercount of minorities and inner city dwellers.   ``This is a civil-rights issue, not a money issue,'' said NewYork City Corporation Counsel Peter L. Zimroth. ``The money issecondary, what we want is the most accurate count. There are peoplein this country who are not brought into account. They are losingrepresentation.''   Mayor Edward I. Koch, who called the agreement a ``a greatvictory'' for the city, added, ``The impact is money.''   Relying on the one-person, one-vote doctrine, New York City _joined by two states and several major cities with large minoritypopulations and civil-rights organizations _ filed suit lastNovember to get the census bureau to use a statistical methoddevised to correct the undercount.   The dispute focuses on drawing electoral districts for the Houseof Representatives.   Because the House is limited to 435 members, distributedaccording to population, areas where people are missed in the censuslose seats to other states. In addition, many federal programsdistribute money according to population.   Under a settlement announced in federal court, the CommerceDepartment and the Census Bureau agreed to set up an eight-personpanel of statisticians and demographers to review the results of the1990 census and recommend to the commerce secretary whether thenumbers need to be adjusted.   The secretary will not be bound by the recommendations.   Following the nationwide head count, the Census Bureau also willconduct a massive followup survey, sampling 150,000 householdsnationwide to determine whether the final tally should be adjusted.   A somewhat smaller survey already was planned to evaluate thecount.   Following criticism that it missed as much as 1 percent to 2percent of the population in 1980, the Census Bureau alreadyanalyzed the possibility of adjusting its figures for under-countingof some population segments.   However, last fall the Commerce Department, parent agency for theCensus, decided against making an adjustment.   Commerce officials said they didn't believe any sample could beas accurate as the national head count itself. They also said theywere concerned an adjustment would undermine public confidence inthe Census.   That decision was widely criticized.   Barbara Bailar, the Census official who researched methods ofadjustment, resigned. She is now head of the American StatisticalAssociation. Bailer could not be reached for comment on Monday'sagreement.   In addition, some local officials accused the department ofplaying politics in the decision, an accusation the departmentdenied.   Because the undercount largely affects minorities and inner-cityresidents _ most often represented by Democrats _ critics assertedthat Republicans stood to benefit from cancelling the adjustmentplans.   ``The agreement provides for a careful and thoroughre-examination as to whether the census requires adjustment toproduce a more accurate population count,'' Secretary of CommerceRobert Mosbacher said in a statement.   In the suit joined by New York state, California, Los Angeles,Chicago, Houston, Dade County, Fla., and several civil-rightsorganizations, New York City charged that the methods of the CensusBureau commonly undercount blacks, Hispanics, the homeless andillegal aliens.   Zimroth said the agreement potentially means ``many millions ofdollars'' for the city in federal funds lost because of theundercounting. It also could affect legislative boundaries, whichare drawn according to population.   According to the city, the 1980 census missed as many as 500,000people, or 6 percent of the city's population. The mayor's officesaid the city has lost out on more than $200 million since the 1980census because of the undercounting.   Stephen Hart, a Justice Department lawyer, said that as many as 7percent of the nation's blacks were overlooked in previous censuses.The Census Bureau was looking at methods to reduce the undercount,caused by people not responding to questionnaires or not cooperatingwith neighborhood canvassers.   Monday's agreement removed a motion by the city for a preliminaryinjunction that could have stopped the 1990 census.</TEXT></DOC>
