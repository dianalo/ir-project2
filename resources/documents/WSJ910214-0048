Thepanel of trade experts held that the commission's injuryfinding wasn't supported by adequate evidence.   The bilateral panels have replaced judicial review ofrulings by trade tribunals in U.S.-Canadian trade disputes.This is the biggest trade case to be referred to aU.S.-Canada panel since the trade agreement took effect Jan.1, 1989. Canada exports pork products valued at about 350million Canadian dollars (US$303.4 million) to the U.S. ayear, or about 3% of current U.S. consumption.   The case was referred to the ITC for an injurydetermination after the U.S. Commerce Department ruled thatCanadian pork producers were receiving subsidies from theCanadian government. The ITC made its ruling in Sept. 1989,and a countervailing duty, currently amounting to three centsa pound, was imposed on imports of Canadian fresh and frozenpork.   The countervailing duty is due to be lifted as a result ofthe commission's reversal of its decision, and Canadian porkexporters are to be refunded about $15 million in dutiespaid.   Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie said the ITC'sreversal of its decision against Canadian pork producers &quot;wasonly made possible because of the unique dispute settlementprocedures of the free trade agreement.&quot; The Canadiangovernment strongly insisted on such procedures when itnegotiated the agreement with the U.S.   The U.S. National Pork Producers' Council, which filed thecomplaint, said it was disappointed by the commission'sreversal of its injury ruling.   Two of the three commissioners, David Rohr and DonNewquist, strongly criticized restrictions set by the panelon their inquiry. &quot;We believe that these restrictions arecontrary to the facts and the law, but because they areimposed by the panel, they are legally binding on us,&quot; thetwo commissioners said. The third commissioner is AnneBrunsdale, acting chairwoman.</TEXT></DOC>
