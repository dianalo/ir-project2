Atanother &quot;woodhenge&quot; near Stonehenge itself, there is direct evidence of humansacrifice: the remains of a child whose skull had been split in two.;   Throughout the British Isles there are about 100 sites that qualify aspossible woodhenges, the remains of circular constructions that have beenidentified from aerial photography. It is likely that most were merely largecircular huts.;    The Welshpool site was discovered from aerial photographsin 1975 but was left undisturbed until plans were announced for the new road.;   The team has only three months to complete the dig. When the work is over,the archaeologists plan to put new timbers in the holes to recapture brieflythe sight that existed 4,000 years ago.;    The period of circle constructionbegan about 3,000 B.C. and lasted until about 1,000 B.C., covering the newStone Age of polished tools and the beginning of the Bronze Age.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  London Observer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  London  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910219  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  362  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday February 19, 199100050124,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
