Not so long ago, it was widely assumed that building anatom bomb required either access to one of the world's largeuranium-enrichment facilities or ownership of an expensivereactor capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium. Somecountries -- India, for example -- have gone the reactorroute, insisting that the only purpose is for &quot;research.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   But there are more primitive ways to produce weapons-gradematerial. If you have enough time and patience, relativelysimple and easily concealed equipment will eventually enrichordinary uranium sufficiently to make it usable in a bomb.   This means that efforts to control nuclear proliferation,never wholly effective in the past, will become even less soin the future. As military analyst Kenneth R. Timmermanexplained on these pages in late July, the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) did not stopSaddam's bomb project, even though he has permitted visitsfrom the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agencyinspectors. Indeed, Mr. Timmerman now says, the inspectorsroaming Iraq have discovered bomb-making facilities atTarmiyah and Ash Shaqat, but the equipment is nowhere to befound. It almost certainly has been dispersed and hidden insome of Iraq's thousands of underground bunkers.   A Third World tyrant can build an atom bomb today withlittle risk of detection. As to finding a rocket to launchit, North Korea or China will have one to sell. Its guidancesystem may not be accurate but ranges and accuracy of ThirdWorld rockets will improve. The CIA estimates that 15 to 20developing countries will have ballistic missiles by the year2000.   These prospects drastically alter the world strategicequation. One of the less-understood lessons of Vietnam wasthat an underdeveloped country can defeat a modern superpowerin part because underdeveloped countries have few criticaltargets for the superpower to attack. They have little tolose. If some future madman in Iran decided to launch anuclear-armed ICBM against London, is it plausible that theU.S., in fulfillment of its NATO obligations, would launch anuclear counterstrike against Iran? If so, what would thetarget be, the teeming masses of Tehran? What would thataccomplish? As Mr. Timmerman noted, Iran may well be buildinga bomb at a facility in the Elburz Mountains.   For an explanation of how to build an atom bomb on thecheap, I'm indebted to a newsletter called Access to Energy,published by Petr Beckmann, University of Colorado professoremeritus of electrical engineering. Prof. Beckmann has beencirculating his &quot;pro-science, pro-technology, pro-freeenterprise&quot; letter for years, and is one of the world'sclearest thinkers on peaceful and non-peaceful uses of theatom. The Beckmann thesis is simple: Properly designednuclear-power plants are a boon, providing a safe, cheap,clean source of electricity; nuclear weapons kill people.   Prof. Beckmann writes in his August letter that &quot;the Bushadministration was unbelievably careless to think thatdestroying Saddam's official or even secret reactors woulddestroy his nuclear program.&quot; You don't need a high-techreactor yielding plutonium to build a bomb. You can do itwith ordinary uranium, which Iraq can mine from its owndeposits and refine into yellowcake. It is only necessary tofind a way of separating U 235, the fissile isotope thatconstitutes 0.7% of refined uranium, from U 238, thenon-fissile isotope that makes up the other 99.3%. When youget 50 pounds of &quot;enriched&quot; material -- 90% U 235 -- it is ashort step to a bomb that will blow up thousands of people.   How did Saddam conduct his uranium-enrichment program? Hefirst tried it the fast way, with a French-built &quot;research&quot;reactor capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium. But heboasted about the first Arab atom bomb and the Israelis blewup his reactor in 1981.   After that experience, Saddam turned to methods that aremore primitive but harder to detect. The best guess of U.N.investigators is that he is using something called a&quot;calutron,&quot; which shoots gasified uranium particles throughan electromagnetic field that curves their path. Centrifugalforce sends the heavier U 238 to the outside of the curve,leaving the lighter U 235 on the inside, where it hits a leadtarget from which it later can be dissolved chemically.   Prof. Beckmann thinks the Iraqis might actually be using asimilar device called a jet enricher, which does theseparation mechanically. Either way, these are both oldtechnologies (calutrons were considered and discarded as tooslow during the Manhattan Project) and it takes a largenumber of cycles to achieve 90% U 235 purity. But eventuallyyou get there. Once you have enough enriched weapons-gradeuranium, it is no great feat to build a trigger to touch offan explosion. An Iraqi defector came up with the startlingnews that Iraq may already have enough bomb-grade uranium tomake two bombs.   These devices are small enough to be hauled around ontrucks, as Iraq apparently has done, and any number can workseparately in many places. The U.N. team estimates that Iraqmay have some 100 calutrons, all built in Iraq itself. SaysProf. Beckmann: &quot;The uranium shipments to one or more centraldepots can proceed at night far more easily than those ofSCUD missiles, whose nocturnal transportation the U.S. AirForce was not able to spot.&quot;   Or as Mr. Timmerman put it, &quot;searching for Iraq's uraniumenrichment equipment and nuclear weapons labs will be likeseeking a bit of straw in the desert sand. Allied bombers cancripple industrial sites and conventional weapons factories,but they cannot destroy every basement and cellar&quot; in acountry the size of Iraq.   Nor can they in other potentially aggressive countries.Missile launchers are easier to detect than enrichers, buteven relatively long-range missiles can be hidden, as Westernsurveillance technicians have learned in their efforts tofind mobile Soviet SS-25s.   Clearly, the only sane response to the future securityneeds of the U.S. and Europe lies in missile defense.Ground-based defenses, such as the Patriots that performed sowell in Saudi Arabia and Israel, are an immediate answer, buthaving a nuclear bomb explode overhead is not appealing.   That means space-based defenses capable of wide coverage,detection of launches and interception at high altitudes willbecome essential. The sooner that reality is faced, the saferWestern democracies will be from the likes of Saddam Hussein.</TEXT></DOC>
