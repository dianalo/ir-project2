 Assertion 1: the ability to program a computeris more dependant on an individual's characteristic way of reasoning than onany educational process.andP;  We shall call the facility of reasoning forprogramming 'it'.andP;  Assertion 2: many people haven't got 'it'.andP;  Corollary: (orit may be a lemma, who cares, it's only there to annoy the anti-paradigmbrigade) it is foolish to employ those who haven't got 'it' as computerprogrammers.andM;Yet, unless my time as a programme was exceptional, there are drones ofpeople who haven't got 'it' out there.andP;  Perhaps not so much in small outfits,where such individuals are not likely to survive the three month trial (but,on the other hand, compassion may prevent prompt, direct action), but loadsin larger companies, where they can often be found sitting in small, darkoffices, reading newspapers.andM;I'll tell you how to detect the man that hasn't got enough of 'it'.andP;  He's thechap the comes up to your desk, smiles sweetly, and asks how to use a libraryroutine that you wrote a couple of months back.andP;  So you scribble on thewhiteboard, and show him examples, and write down the particular form of callthat he needs on his pad; all he need to do now is go back and type it in.andO;All the time you are doing this, he is nodding and smiling and making littlegrunts of affirmation.andP;  As he turns to go, however, he will betray himselfwith some completely inane remark: 'Just one thing, though.andP;  What is thedifference between the first parameter and the first argument'.andM;Recently, I set out to find a new Staff Writer for this magazine.andP;  I decidedthat as well as being literate and knowledgeable about the computer industry,I needed somebody who was a competent programmer, who could see issues from aprogrammer's point of view.andP;  Somebody, in short, who had 'it'.andP;  How to detect'it'?andM;I considered the usual methods (as applied to me) of assessing candidates.andO;First there is the CV.andP;  Qualifications are near useless.andP;  I've known plentyof non-programmers with Computer Science or Mathematics degrees or A-levels.andO;Ability in maths, incidentally, says nearly nothing about ability to program.andO;My maths master, who could integrate any function you care to name all overthe complex plane, thought my BASIC 'Bomber' program was magical.andP;  Employmenthistory is also potentially misleading - it could just be a list of otherdupes, written out in reverse chronological order.andM;You can't decide whether a candidate has 'it' from an interview.andP;  All you cando is decide if he is good a being interviewed.andP;  The stereotype says that allprogrammers are hopeless introverts, so I suppose, if you are prepared toback the stereotype down the line, you could accept the most hopeless,embarrassed interviewee.andP;  I don't back the stereotype: besides, I was tryingto fill a journalist's post - the ability to communicate easily wasmoderately desirable.andM;The other, not-that-useful thing that you can find out from an interview iswhether the victim knows all the switches on the Microsoft C compiler, andwhether he can remember if the Motorola 6809 supports an instruction forshift left logically register1 by register2, and what the mnemonic is.andP;  Tojudge from recruitment adverts ('...candidate will have real time experienceusing Pascal on a VAX 11-780, connected via a VT220 terminal, with the lefthand LED keyboard design'), most employers appear to think that in-deptknowledge of their particular programming setup is the most valuable thing acandidate can offer.andP;  I disagree.andP;  The good programmer can adjust to anenvironment very quickly; but you will never get any useful work out of theman who hasn't got 'it'.andP;  People without 'it' have a lot of spare time ontheir hands while they are not writing any programs; some of them use it tomemorise system commands and to learn new programming languages.andP;  Knowledgeis no substitute for skill.andM;OK, clever guts, so what did you do?andP;  Thought you'd never ask.andP;  I made mycandidates write (and debug) a short program called REVERSE.andP;  It accepted anumber of command line arguments, then printed them out, in reverse order, incaps.andP;  REVERSE Hell to go printed GO TO HELL.andP;  Experiments on coleaguessuggested that a competent programmer, working in his own machine andcompiler, with no other pressures, can do this in about five minutes.andP;  (Tryit yourself.andP;  On your marks, set, go!).andP;  The average candidate, sweating awayin his suit, took rather longer.andM;The best attempt that I recorded was by one Mr Dan O'Brien.andP;  A warm,congratulatory round of applause for him, please.andP;  Although this was by nomeans the sole determining factor, a glance at this month's mast-head showsthat I practise as I preach.andP;  So does my system deliver?andP;  You decide.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
