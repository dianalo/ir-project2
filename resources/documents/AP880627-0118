Carpenter, 58, already has been sentenced to death for the 1981killings of two 20-year-old women in Santa Cruz County parks.   The series of attacks along popular Northern California hikingtrails panicked outdoor enthusiasts and left the parks nearly emptyof hikers for months.   Carpenter, whose criminal history includes 17 years imprisonmentfor crimes including attempted murder and rape, was convicted May10 by the same San Diego jurors for the five 1980 Marin Countyshootings.   The victims were Cynthia Moreland, 18, of Cotati; RichardStowers, 19, of Petaluma; Anne Alderson, 26, San Rafael; DianeO'Connell, 22, San Jose, and Shauna May, 25, San Francisco.   Superior Court Judge Herbert Hoffman scheduled a July 19 hearingfor Carpenter's formal sentencing. He can either follow the jury'srecommendation or sentence Carpenter to life imprisonment withoutpossibility of parole.   The trial was moved to San Diego because of pretrial publicity.   Carpenter's defense was based on a claim that his troubledchildhood, including physical and mental abuse, and psychologicalproblems mitigated circumstances in the killings.   Jurors hearing the case in San Diego were not told of previousconvictions and sentence for the Santa Cruz murders of Ellen MarieHansen and Heather Scaggs.   The Santa Cruz case was heard in Los Angeles Superior Court in1984 on a change of venue, also granted because of heavy publicity.</TEXT></DOC>
