Fayette operates over 1600 turbinesnear Tracy, California. If the negotiations to purchase Fayette's assetsare successful, the Fayette Corporation will apparently continue to exist,but as a research and development company. Fayette has been concentratingon the development of a 250 kW turbine for the last year or so and plansto continue that development. Besides negotiating to purchase the assetsof Fayettes wind projects, the Swiss group reportedly has plans to developan additional 900 MW of wind facilities over the next three years andplans to acquire existing SO4 power purchase contracts in Californiato reach its goal. Under the initial phase of the group's plans, up totwo hundred seventy 300-400 kW wind turbines could be installed. Apparentlya number of turbines will be installed for evaluation under a testingprogram. Under the project financing proposal, any turbine manufacturerwould have to be financially strong enough to back the operation of theturbines for a considerable period of time.</TEXT></DOC>
