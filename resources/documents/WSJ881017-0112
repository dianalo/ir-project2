Both George Bush and Michael Dukakis are campaigning on it. The hippest movies and television shows are affirming it. Even TV commercials now are playing on it -- see the recent American Express ad in which a harried executive uses the card to fly home -- just in time to see his daughter's school play.    But all of that rings a little hollow to James Dobson. &quot;The pro-family movement is being resoundingly beaten in the great marketplace of ideas,&quot; he says. &quot;The tide of battle has shifted against us.&quot;    Radio host, author, conservative activist and head of the California-based organization Focus on the Family, Mr. Dobson is one of the nation's staunchest advocates of what can only be called traditional family values. To him, those precepts include loyalty and permanence in marriage, raising children with discipline as well as affection, regard for &quot;the worth of every human being&quot; and a spiritual undergirding &quot;that gives meaning to life and the family.&quot;    Mr. Dobson doesn't fit the media archetype of the Christian rightist. He's not a preacher or an evangelist per se. His ministry doesn't beg for money on the air. Unlike the Rev. Jerry Falwell, Mr. Dobson doesn't loudly declare his positions on every political issue. And, though he maintains his share of Washington contacts, it isn't his style to schmooze with the political elite. While the Rev. Billy Graham was at Barbara Bush's side as George Bush delivered his speech to the Republican Convention, Mr. Dobson was home in California.    &quot;Our objective is no more ambitious than to reconnect the family with the wisdom of the Judeo-Christian value system that has endured for generations,&quot; he says.    Indeed, Mr. Dobson has emerged as a champion to millions of Americans, many of them evangelical Christians. Consider:   --Mr. Dobson's half-hour, five-day-a-week radio program, &quot;Focus on the Family,&quot; airs on more stations (1,250) than any other show in the country except Paul Harvey's syndicated news-and-commentary, and continues to gain new outlets.    --Focus has a staff of more than 550, a new $14 million headquarters in Pomona, Calif., and a projected 1988 budget of $42 million, 98% of it from individual contributors. (Mr. Dobson helps underwrite radio-syndication costs and draws no salary.)    --Two film series presenting Mr. Dobson's views and advice have been seen by tens of millions, primarily in churches. Thousands pack his rare public lectures.    --A psychologist by training and popularly known as &quot;Dr. Dobson,&quot; he has sold more than six million copies of his 11 family-advice books, including two published last year that remain best-sellers in Christian book stores. Since his first book 18 years ago, &quot;Dare to Discipline,&quot; Mr. Dobson has become an answer man for many baby-boomer parents much as Dr. Benjamin Spock was for a previous, perhaps more liberal generation.    The bulk of Mr. Dobson's work continues to be aimed at buttressing the family per se. This month, for instance, his radio show will include advice on &quot;rebuilding damaged marriages,&quot; being a &quot;positive parent&quot; and dealing with alcoholics and rebellious teens.    But it's in public issues where Mr. Dobson's influence increasingly is being felt, although he says only 2% of Focus on the Family's budget is spent there. Mr. Dobson is among Christian leaders actively opposing distribution of &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ.&quot; Focus on the Family last November launched &quot;Citizen,&quot; a monthly magazine meant to aid supporters &quot;in making (their) Christian views known.&quot;    In one recent display of punch, &quot;Focus&quot; listeners helped swamp congressional switchboards with more than a half-million calls in one day last March opposing the Civil Rights Restoration Act. Mr. Dobson rallied supporters against the bill because he saw it as &quot;an incredible intrusion into religious liberties.&quot; Judicial interpretation, he fears, could lead to forced hiring of drug addicts, transvestites, AIDS patients and others by religious bodies that accept federal funds. (The law was passed over President Reagan's veto.)    Mr. Dobson's first exposure to public-policy making came when President Carter appointed him in 1980 to a group that summarized the White House Conferences on the Family in 1980. The Reagan administration has named him to three spots, including, in 1986, then-Attorney General Edwin Meese's controversial pornography commission.    His stormiest appointment was his most recent. Mr. Dobson and two other conservatives last spring quit Health and Human Services Secretary Otis Bowen's teen-pregnancy prevention panel because, as advisory members, they weren't granted votes or the right to prepare a minority report. They also said that to remain would serve as tacit endorsement of the final report.    &quot;It became clear that the panel would recommend distribution of condoms and amoral advice to the nation's teen-agers,&quot; says Mr. Dobson. &quot;That approach not only fails to solve the problem of adolescent pregnancy, it exacerbates it.&quot;    (Focus on the Family is anti-abortion, and helps in efforts to counsel pregnant women considering that course to choose adoption instead.)    In an American conservative Christian community that has seen several of its temporal leaders fall to scandal, many put Mr. Dobson's ministry in the same lofty category as that of the Rev. Graham. A survey of Christian-magazine readers released earlier this year by the World Home Bible League, an evangelistic organization based in South Holland, Ill., showed that Mr. Dobson and Focus on the Family were the &quot;favorite ministry,&quot; ranking just ahead of the Rev. Graham's.    Yet the appeal of Mr. Dobson's message extends beyond evangelicals to mainline Protestants, Catholics and even non-Christians because of his common-sensical approach to family life and his willingness to support his morality with a practicality rooted in his professional training. Focus on the Family receives about 150,000 letters a month.    &quot;The country is looking for people who understand the problems the American family is facing and who talk about those problems in the context of values -- and that's what Dr. Dobson does so well,&quot; says Gary L. Bauer, President Reagan's assistant for policy development.    Adds George Gallup Jr., the pollster: &quot;He's really striking a responsive chord in the populace.&quot;    Of course, the chord strikes many unharmoniously. For example, David Crane, issues director of People for the American Way, the liberal Washington-based group, attacks Mr. Dobson's opposition to the Civil Rights Restoration Act and to &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; as &quot;typical of the religious right's agenda.&quot;    Yet, Mr. Crane concedes, Mr. Dobson &quot;seems to have a fairly significant audience. That tells me there's a market out there for his ideas.&quot;    Despite his growing popularity, Mr. Dobson remains aloof from partisan politics: He won't endorse a presidential candidate and professes no interest in running for office himself, despite urgings.    He has served as a sounding board for Mr. Bauer, Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop and other Reagan administration officials. Susan Baker, wife of George Bush's campaign chief James Baker, serves on Focus on the Family's board. But Mr. Dobson has found common cause with Democrats such as anti-lewd-rock crusader Tipper Gore. &quot;I will work with anyone who promotes the pro-family cause,&quot; he says.    That cause is in retreat, Mr. Dobson is convinced, particularly in Congress. He points to legislation such as federalized child care. Continued widespread abortions and sales of hard-core pornography also have him glum. Meanwhile, on the 1988 campaign trail, &quot;those with extremely liberal views are masquerading as pro-family advocates,&quot; Mr. Dobson says. &quot;Obviously, the word is out that family issues translates into political muscle, so everyone is jumping on board.&quot;    ---   Mr. Buss, a former Journal reporter, is business editor of the St. Petersburg Times. </TEXT></DOC>
