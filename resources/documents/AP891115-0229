He remembers love scenes and music, but certain passages haveslipped his mind; picking up the book again will be like reading itfor the first time.   It always works that way. Faces of old friends become blurredover the years. Listen to your favorite song 100 times and a noteor turn of phrase will still surprise you. Only the most fanaticalLucy fan can anticipate every joke.   Memory, music, ``I Love Lucy'' _ they all matter in ``The MamboKings Plays Songs of Love'' (Farrar, Straus andamp; Giroux, $18.95), inwhich Desi Arnaz briefly drops in on the world of brothers Cesarand Nestor Castillo, and to their astonishment, transports them tothe living room of Lucy and Ricky Ricardo.   ``Arnaz was always one of the essential, successful Cubans,''said Hijuelos, the son of Cuban immigrants. ``He didn't have a downimage. When you think about how Latins are portrayed in the media,even today, they're either hoods or they're cops.   ``He was a middle-class man, very successful. He had awhacked-out life, but he had a real relationship, a real life, andthat image really enchanted me. He also a slight melancholicstreak. He had a lot of qualities that I related to.''   Try to remember this ``I Love Lucy'' episode: Two Cubanbrothers, old friends of Ricky's, arrive at the apartment one day.They exchange chitchat with the Ricardos, and later appear at theTropicana, crooning ``Beautiful Maria of My Soul'' with thebandleader himself joining the brothers on stage. (Lucy, naturally,is upset because she wanted to appear in the show instead).   Sound familiar? Well, it never really happened, but that's thepoint. ``Mambo Kings'' is a song of invented memory, a mournfulmelody of events distorted by nostalgia and loss.   ``The one thing you don't lose is memory, and memory nags you,''Hijuelos said. ``Look at Jewish writers who write about things thathave happened, internally things go around and around and around.   ``If you're hung up on the past you can't move forward. Nestortries to get courage from the American notion of discarding thepast and move forward.''   Loss of youth, love and country run through ``Mambo Kings.'' Inthe late 1940s, Carlos _ gregarious and ambitious _ and Nestor _moody and romantic _ arrive in New York as aspiring mambomusicians. The end comes 30 years later, in a rundown hotel roomwhere Carlos drinks himself to death.   Women inspire their songs and their songs inspire women. Loveaffairs for Carlos are as intense, and short-lived, as the latestdance craze. For Nestor, heartbreak is timeless, a haunting balladundiminished by repeated listenings.   And memories of home are inescapable for both Castillos. Noamount of rum, women and song can replace their simple, easygoinglife in Cuba.   ``I think most immigrants are basically homesick,'' Hijuelossaid. ``You can't imagine losing something like your country unlessyou've really lost it. It's just a dream of something lost, whichyou can never really retrieve.   ``You meet Cubans in Miami who have made a million bucks, butthey will never have what they had before.''   Hijuelos was born in 1951 and grew up on 118th Street onManhattan's Upper West Side, a neighborhood remembered in his firstnovel, ``Our House in the Last World,'' published in 1985.   He first wanted to be a musician, but was turned off by the rock'n' roll drug scene and drifted into writing in his mid-20s.Hijuelos nearly quit that as well, finding authors no moreappealing than rock stars.   ``I went to a writers conference in 1978 and I found it the mostsexist, hierarchal, opinionated, prejudical place I've ever been onEarth. If you don't write their way, you don't write. If you're awoman and pretty, you get invited to parties, if not, forget it.''   Meeting author Donald Barthelme, who died recently, providedHijuelos with a valued friend and mentor.   ``He sort of took me under his wing and pointed me in the rightdirection,'' Hijuelos recalled. ``He wasn't narrow-minded in hisview of literature and exposed me to a lot of writers. And eventhough I was writing quite differently from him, he never held thatagainst me.''   ``He was a really nice man and a top-notch editorial adviser.''   Barthelme helped with ``Mambo Kings,'' and Arnaz and somenot-so-famous musicians provided inspiration. Hijuelos recalledworking in a downtown office where the elevator operator would comeup to his floor and sing. A Cuban musician who died in a Londonhotel room made a lasting impression.   And, of course, there were songs, hundreds of them. ``MamboKings'' is like a greatest hits album, complete with Hijuelos'favorite dance songs, boleros and ballads.   Hijuelos urges readers to start where they wish, open at anypage, like dropping the needle in the middle of a record, or tuningin ``I Love Lucy'' at intermission and quickly filling in the plot.   ``Barthelme was like that. Instead of thinking of a chapter as achapter, you think of it as an atmosphere, a state ofconsciousness,'' he said. ``I wrote this book where you can open itup anywhere and get an idea of what's going on in the book.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, Nov. 24-26</NOTE></DOC>
