Greenberger   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>03/08/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12</SO><CO>   MDEST</CO><IN>AEROSPACE (ARO)</IN><GV>STATE DEPARTMENT (STD)DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF)</GV><LP>   SHANNON, Ireland -- Secretary of State James Baker offeredto meet with Palestinians when he visits Israel next week, asthe focus of U.S. policy in the Mideast shifted to diplomacyfrom military action.   Mr. Baker, who was on the first leg of a 10-day trip tothe Middle East and the Soviet Union, told reporters that &quot;IfPalestinians want to meet, I would, of course, be pleased tomeet with them.&quot; Mr. Baker, however, will probably avoidmeeting with representatives or associates of the PalestineLiberation Organization.</LP><TEXT>   The offer to meet with Palestinians is likely to displeasethe Israelis, who were infuriated when Palestinians cheeredIraq's Scud missile attacks on Israel. Mr. Baker's commentscame the day after President Bush, in a speech to Congress,suggested that Israel trade occupied land for peace.   While Mr. Baker embarked on the first major U.S.diplomatic effort in the postwar Mideast, Defense SecretaryDick Cheney said in Washington that the Pentagon envisionsbringing U.S. forces back from the Mideast to bases in theU.S. and Germany at a rate of about 5,000 troops a day. Hesaid nearly all the troops should be out within three or fourmonths.   He cautioned that the actual speed of the pullout dependsgreatly on the signing of a formal cease-fire and on Iraq'sfull compliance with United Nations resolutions but that heremains optimistic the vast majority of U.S. troops will behome by early summer. &quot;I think we will, I hope we will . . .have the diplomatic situation resolved&quot; by then, thesecretary said. &quot;But if we don't, then we could end up havingto leave {troops in Iraq} longer than would otherwise be thecase.&quot;   Mr. Baker's offer to meet with Palestinians was aconciliatory gesture, but arranging a meeting may bedifficult. Senior U.S. officials traveling with him saidneither the U.S. nor any Palestinians had requested such ameeting.   The U.S. broke off a dialogue with the PLO last year afterits leader, Yasser Arafat, refused to condemn a Palestinianterrorist attack against Israel. Since then, Palestiniansupport for Iraq has incurred the anger of such former Arabsupporters as Saudi Arabia, which fought in the coalitionagainst Iraq.   Still, many Palestinians continued to view Mr. Arafat'sPLO as their representative, so the job of findingPalestinian partners who would be acceptable to Israel andother Arab states is likely to be difficult.   More broadly, Mr. Baker said the U.S. doesn't believe nowis &quot;the appropriate time&quot; for an international peaceconference on the Mideast, an idea being pushed by Arabstates but rejected by Israel. The administration is seekingto encourage talks between Israel and Arab states and betweenIsrael and Palestinians.   In addition to Mideast peace, one of the main topics onMr. Baker's trip will be how to limit proliferation ofweapons in the region. Mr. Baker said he hoped there would bea &quot;large degree of consenus&quot; among states in the region andarms suppliers to curb the spread of weapons of massdestruction. But he raised doubts about the prospect forcontrolling conventional arms sales to the region.   Unless there is broad interest in containing conventionalarms sales, &quot;it's not something that can be pursued with anypossibility of success,&quot; he said.   The U.S., one of the largest suppliers of conventionalarms to the region, currently is considering major arms salesto Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the small Persian Gulf states. Italso regularly provides arms to Israel.   ---   Andy Pasztor contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
