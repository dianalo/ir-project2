In a capital filled with military strategists, there arethousands of scenarios. None of them is likely to reflectprecisely the thinking of Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf and hiscolleagues in Riyadh. But here, drawing heavily on thethinking of retired Col. Trevor N. Dupuy, a defense analystand military historian, are the four most likely options:                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   Air Power                                                                                                          Airplanes first played a major military role in World WarI. Is it finally possible, 75 years later, to win a war withair power alone?   Maybe so. The first part of this scenario is being playedout now with the heavy strikes against Iraq's war-makingmachine, including its French-built air-defense network, itscommand-and-control system, its aircraft, missiles, runwaysand radar installations.   Another key early target has been the elite RepublicanGuard, 100,000 or more of Saddam Hussein's toughest troops.   By most accounts, this first phase of the battle has beena success. The one marked disappointment was the failure ofallied weaponry to destroy all of the elusive mobile Scudmissile launchers at the outset of the war. Iraq, attemptingto draw Israel into the war, managed to hit Israel with lessthan a dozen Scuds.   The final act in this air-power drama is soon to begin:concentrated attacks, lasting four or five days, by B-52bombers on 100,000 Iraqi soldiers entrenched in what Col.Dupuy calls the Forward Defensive Line along theSaudi-Kuwaiti border.   The B-52s and other allied aircraft &quot;will have a field dayattacking the unprotected ground units,&quot; says Col. Dupuy.Adding to the din will be Navy missiles and maybe even16-inch shells from the Navy's ancient battleships. &quot;Thiswill probably be the most devastating anti-personnelbombardment in the history of warfare,&quot; Col. Dupuy predicts.   Will it end the war? The test will be if dazed Iraqisoldiers begin surrendering, in small groups first, and thenwhole units at a time.   If the air war fails to bring Iraq to its knees, Gen.Schwarzkopf will be forced to commit his infantry to battle.The major elements include the Army's Seventh Corps on theleft, Arab troops in the center and the U.S. Marines andBritain's Desert Rats on the right.                                                                                                          Frontal Assault                                                                                                          Frontal assaults are no longer popular with U.S. militaryplanners because they are almost always too costly in humanlives. Even so, two eventualities might cause the generals tosend the heaviest U.S. units straight at the Iraqifortifications along the Saudi-Kuwaiti border. The firstwould be if the defenders are so dazed and befuddled by theair attacks they are ripe for the taking. The other would beif the Iraqis have managed to extend their fortified lines sofar to the west that it would be difficult to turn theirflank.   Any frontal assault would be preceded by &quot;carpet bombing&quot;of the weakest point in the Iraqi lines, followed by amassive punching strike through the rubble. The attack wouldbe accompanied by one or more air assaults just behind theenemy lines, according to Col. Dupuy, who has givencongressional testimony about his views and published atimely book called &quot;If War Comes: How to Defeat SaddamHussein.&quot;   But this kind of attack could be extremely difficult.&quot;Iraqi defensive doctrine is built upon the use of atriangular defensive complex of mutually supporting positionsor strong points,&quot; notes Col. Dupuy. The Iraqi infantrymenare positioned in trenches or foxholes that connect each ofthe triangle's three strong points. Iraqi tanks usually aredug in on both flanks of each triangle. In front of thesepositions are anti-tank ditches, some of which are filledwith flammable oil, minefields and barbed wire. Reserves arestationed to the rear, ready to reinforce threatenedpositions.   Tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles would storm thesepositions following the aerial bombardment. If they breakthrough, they would keep right on rolling, engaging theRepublican Guard in central Kuwait and perhaps even pushingon to Baghdad. At about the same time, other units -- perhapsArab forces -- would liberate Kuwait City.                                                                                                          Siege Warfare                                                                                                          In this scenario, allied armies would initiate a series ofwhat Col. Dupuy calls &quot;probes and limited attacks&quot; againstIraqi forces. The idea would be to keep the Iraqis offbalance and require them to fire off their limited supply ofmunitions. This kind of fighting, Col. Dupuy says, wouldbuild the confidence of the untested allied troops. It mightcause the Iraqis to collapse. Even if that didn't happen, itwould weaken them so that the final assault would be far lesscostly in human lives. The problem, Col. Dupuy admits, ispolitical: Americans want to get this war over quickly.                                                                                                          Flanking Attacks                                                                                                          Going around the enemy -- not straight at him -- is whatAmerican generals are taught to do. And so, if the infantryis finally committed to this battle, a flanking attack is farand away the most likely scenario, says Col. Dupuy.   What probably will happen is that Arab troops will holdthe center, dug in just as tenaciously as their Iraqi foes onthe other side. As the fighting begins, they will make probesand secondary attacks.   But the real fighting will begin on the wings.   To the left, the west, the Seventh Corps -- led by, amongvarious units, the First and 24th Mechanized InfantryDivisions, the First Cavalry Division and the Third ArmoredDivision -- will begin encircling the entrenched Iraqipositions.   To the right, the east, the Marines with the British FirstArmored Division, will begin driving up the Persian Gulfcoastline toward Kuwait City. This attack probably would beaccompanied by a Marine amphibious assault behind Iraqilines.   U.S. Marines also are likely to storm ashore on BubiyanIsland, believed to be defended by an Iraqi marine brigade,north of Kuwait City, and to occupy two smaller islands southof Bubiyan. The following day, the American Marines wouldmake their way across the channel to the mainland, predictsCol. Dupuy. They would secure the oil fields and face offagainst whatever Republican Guard forces were stilloperational.   Meanwhile, a vertical envelopment -- attack from the sky-- would begin as soon as the enveloping Army and Marineunits had moved into position. Col. Dupuy supposes the 82ndAirborne Division would make a landing in central Kuwait,followed soon by the 101st Airborne. They would then movesouth to join Army and Marine units.</TEXT></DOC>
