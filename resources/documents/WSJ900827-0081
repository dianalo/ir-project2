According to individuals familiar with the agreement inprinciple, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said it wouldretain Cravath partners David Boies and Thomas Barr earlierthis month. The unusual agreement, which calls for Cravath towork partly on a contingency-fee basis, is expected to soonbe submitted to the FDIC's board for approval. In acontingency-fee arrangement, law firms earn a percentage ofthe money they win for their client.</LP><TEXT>   Banking industry observers said that by agreeing to hireCravath, the FDIC is showing that it intends to use anunprecedented amount of firepower to prove allegations thatMr. Milken helped thrifts that were big Drexel customers tofraudulently swap high-risk, high-yield &quot;junk&quot; bonds andrecord artificial profits on the sales. No such charges haveever been filed against Mr. Milken or Drexel. A Cravathofficial declined to comment on the assignment. Spokesmen forDrexel and Mr. Milken weren't available to comment.   &quot;You have to hire someone who's pretty sophisticated,someone with a lot of resources, if you're going to get at&quot;the so-called daisy chain, said William M. Isaac, aWashington banking consultant, referring to the network ofsavings and loans Mr. Milken worked with. Retaining Cravathis a &quot;sensible way to proceed because you're going to have alot of big fights on this one,&quot; added Mr. Isaac, a formerchairman of the FDIC.   Messrs. Boies and Barr are among the country's best-knownlitigators. Mr. Boies made his name successfully defendingCBS Inc. against a libel suit brought by retired Gen. WilliamWestmoreland and guiding Texaco Inc. out of bankruptcy-courtproceedings. Mr. Barr was the chief strategist ofInternational Business Machines Corp.'s defense againstgovernment antitrust cases more than a decade ago. They willwork with a team of more than a dozen Cravath partners andassociates.   The FDIC, which investigates possible fraud at insolventthrifts, hires hundreds of outside law firms each year. Lastyear, it paid about $500 million in legal fees to lawyers inthe private sector. But the FDIC usually must settle forfirms that are a cut below Cravath in quality because theagency won't pay top dollar and many law firms with bankingexpertise can't do the work because of conflicts.   The FDIC launched a special task force in June toinvestigate whether Drexel contributed to the savings andloans failures and to pursue losses in Drexel's bankruptcycase. Drexel filed for bankruptcy-court protection inFebruary.   Besides assisting the FDIC in Drexel's bankruptcy case,Cravath will help the agency develop legal theories thatcould enable the FDIC to recover hundreds of millions ofdollars.   Individuals familiar with the FDIC's investigation sayCravath will be focusing on Lincoln Savings andamp; LoanAssociation, CenTrust Savings andamp; Loan and Columbia Savings andamp;Loan, among others.   FDIC general counsel Alfred J.T. Byrne is understood tohave approached Cravath earlier this year about taking theassignment. Mr. Byrne declined to comment, saying only that,&quot;We are considering, among other firms to assist us, majorNew York firms.&quot; He added that an announcement would be madesoon.   The FDIC won't have an easy time recovering lossessuffered by thrifts with ties to Drexel. But it may believeit is in a no-lose situation. Plea agreements entered into byboth Drexel and Mr. Milken to settle civil and criminalcharges against them called for the establishment ofrestitution funds. The more than $700 million is to be usedto settle civil claims against Drexel and Mr. Milken.   Cravath is doing the work relatively inexpensively and hasincentive to try to recover as much money as possible for theFDIC. Under the proposed arrangement, Cravath won't begetting its usual fees, which top $400 an hour. Instead, theFDIC will reimburse Cravath for many expenses and will pay asharply discounted hourly rate. The law firm will also get apercentage of whatever money it recovers.</TEXT></DOC>
