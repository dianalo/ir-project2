The declines have sparked modest increases in house sales.    In the past week, increasing numbers of lenders have cut rates on 30-year fixed-rate loans to a range of 9.25% to 9.5% from a range of 9.5% to 9.75% the previous week. Since May, rates on fixed-rate mortgages have declined by 1 1/2 percentage points. A national survey of 2,000 lenders by HSH Associates, of Butler, N.J., indicates that more than 550 lenders currently offer fixed-rate loans below 10%, double the number just a month ago.    These lenders have undercut the indicated rate for a 30-year fixed loan purchased by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. That rate fell to 9.92% early this week from 10.03% last week. Fully-indexed rates on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage fell slightly to 10.38% early this week from 10.45% the previous week.    The declines, economists said, are largely the result of the slowing economy. The Federal Reserve Board -- which exerted pressure on interest rates as a way to fight the threat of inflation -- has pulled back from the tactic recently as several government economic reports indicate that growth has cooled. In addition, several big banks in recent days have reduced their prime rate, which also typically signals cheaper borrowing costs for consumers.    Additional mortgage-rate declines are expected through mid-August before stabilizing for the rest of the summer and through the fall, economists said. Some economists projected declines of one-eighth of one percentage point. They said that single-digit fixed-rate loans would be available for a sustained period for the first time since 1987.    The rate declines have helped fuel increases in sales of new and existing homes. The National Association of Home Builders reported that new-home sales increased 5.51% in June, for the third straight month, to 670,000 units from 635,000 units in May at an annualized rate. Existing home sales rose 5.92% in June, to 3.4 million units at an annual rate from 3.21 million in May.    The lower rates have improved some markets. In New York City, for instance, Corcoran Group, a brokerage firm that sells Manhattan condominiums and cooperatives, said July sales ballooned 40% compared with June.    Despite the improved housing picture, housing economists said the latest decline in rates would only have a modest effect on sales. They said the rate declines and the wider availability of single-digit loans are developments that are still too new to generate a surge in sales.    High housing prices requiring increasing hefty down payments have blocked some consumers from buying. New-home prices climbed 8.3% in June, to a median of $129,900, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Existing homes prices edged up to a median $93,200 from $92,600 the previous month, the National Association of Realtors said. Demographics also have been a drag on housing sales; the pool of potential buyers has shrunk as baby boomers have aged.    &quot;The (consumer) response to lower rates will be a moderate one,&quot; said Lyle E. Gramley, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association.    Indeed, major home builders, mortgage lenders and real-estate brokers said they don't expect the recent decline -- as well as previous declines earlier this summer -- to produce significant results for the industry. Said Larry Flick, managing partner for Roach Brothers Realty, Devon, Pa.: &quot;There's a lot of activity, but no sales yet. Which is surprising.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
