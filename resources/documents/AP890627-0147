In the past month, more than 75,000 ethnic Turks have crossedinto Turkey to escape an assimilation campaign, the Anatolia newsagency said Tuesday.   The mass emigration followed protests by ethnic Turks in May inwhich Bulgarian police used clubs and dogs to quell. Bulgaria saidseven people died in the protests, but Western sources say up to 30died.   Bulgaria then relaxed its emigration policies. Last week, it said250,000 ethnic Turks had applied for passports and 150,000 of themhad received travel documents.   Chernishev returned to Turkey on Monday after meeting last weekwith Bulgarian President Todor Zhivkov and gave Turkish officials amessage from Zhikov, which he did not disclose.   ``Bulgaria is a Soviet ally. But we also want to improve ourrelations with the friendly country Turkey,'' Anatolia quotedChernishev as saying upon his return.   The Foreign Ministry issued a statement after the meeting andsaid ``there was no reason to be optimistic yet, but the efforts ofthe Soviet Union were appreciated.''   The ministry said the Soviet Union was trying to figure out howit could be helpful in solving the problems of ethnic Turks, whomake up about 1 million of Bulgaria's 9 million people.   Chernishev flew to Moscow on June 21 after Yilmaz summoned him tothe Foreign Ministry and reportedly urged the the Soviet Union playa more active role in the plight of ethnic Turks in Bulgaria.   Premier Turgut Ozal has called on Bulgaria to open negotiationson the status of the mainly Moslem ethnic Turks, who were forced totake Bulgarian names and cannot speak their own language or practicetheir religion in Bulgaria under a 1984 law.   Bulgaria's ethnic Turks and Christian Slavs have been deeplysuspicious of each other since its 500-year rule by the OttomanEmpire. Bulgarian officials blame Turkish propaganda for the exodus.   Ozal wants to hold talks with Bulgaria and the U.N. HighCommissioner for Refugees for an orderly transfer of ethnic Turkswho want to leave Bulgaria. Turkey wants the ethnic Turks to beallowed to dispose of their property and take their liquid wealthwith them.   Ozal said Monday the Soviet Union has been boasting about itssocial and democratic reforms under Mikhail S. Gorbachev and thatthe Kremlin's attitude to the problems of ethnic Turks in Bulgariawould put that to the test.   ``Let us see what kind of a democrat Gorbachev is,'' Ozal said ina speech at Gazi University here.</TEXT></DOC>
