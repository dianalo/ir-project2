The method is appliedto emulsion detectors that were placed in a constant, uniform magneticfield and exposed to beams of 60 and 200 GeV/nucleon O-16 ions at theSuper Proton Synchrotron (SPS) of the European Center for Nuclear Research(CERN). Linear regression analysis is used to determine the azimuthaland polar emission angles from measured track coordinate data. The software,written in BASIC, is designed to be machine independent, and adaptableto an automated system for acquiring the track coordinates. The fittingalgorithm is deterministic, and takes into account the experimental uncertaintyin the measured points. Further, a procedure for using the track datato estimate the linear momenta of the charged particles observed in thedetectors is included.</TEXT></DOC>
