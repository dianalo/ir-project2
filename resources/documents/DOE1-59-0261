Two special cases have been considered:when the pump laser beam propagates (i) perpendicular to the backgroundmagnetic field as an elliptically polarized extraordinary wave, and (ii)along the background magnetic field as a right/left-hand circularly polarizedwave. Explicit expressions for the growth rate and threshold power arepresented. It has been demonstrated that the background magnetic fieldcan significantly affect the growth rate and threshold for forward Ramanscattering and the temperature of hot electrons.</TEXT></DOC>
