These simple, unmanned and remote controlled facilities were alow cost solution to a problem caused by delays of the permanent topsidefacilities. Project execution time was two months from start of conceptualdesign until start-up of oil production. Installation works were performedfrom a jack-up drilling rig - in part simultaneously with drilling operations.Materials and equipment installed were obtained with very short deliverytimes. The facilties which were certified by a Certification Societyand approved by the Danish Authoritites included all necessary safetyfeatures. Total costs for the facilities amounted to c. 1 million US$(excl. rig time for installation). Due to simplicity high reliabilityof the production system was obtained. Availability of the facilitiesfor the entire period from start-up was 99.6 percent. The facilitieswere manned 3.2 percent of the total operating time mainly due to wirelinework for reservoir monitoring. It is considered that the experience withthe concept applied for the early production from the Rolf Field couldform the basis for more simple and cost effective topside facilitiesfor minor offshore fields.</TEXT></DOC>
