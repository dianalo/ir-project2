Topological errors are always grosserrors and must be eliminated to get acceptable information about thestate of the power system. In the following three methods are presented:Method 1 permits the identification of suspicious branches and busesat which topological errors may be present, using an ordinary state estimator.Method 2 allows the identification of the simplest yet most frequenttopological errors arising from non-updated branch status (lines, transformers),by means of an ordinary state estimator. Method 3 allows the identificationof all major topological errors which can occur at a single switchyard,e.g. bus bar splitting and bus bar coupling together with changing overand switching off and on of branches. Furthermore an accelerated procedureis presented to speed up method 1 and 2.</TEXT></DOC>
