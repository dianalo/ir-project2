After the Warsaw Pact presentation, Polish delegate WlodzimierzKonarski told reporters on behalf of the alliance:   ``The introduction of the East European project is an importantstep forward in the negotiations but it is not sufficient. We needa similar presentation of the Western side ... to have a good basisfor cooperative drafting.''   NATO presented a proposal several hours later under which thesuperpowers would be limited to 275,000 soldiers each and thenumbers of tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear weapons would bereduced sharply.   The Western draft ``will strongly spur the negotiations,'' WestGerman negotiator Ruediger Hartmann said after Spain introduced theproposal.   In Geneva, U.S.-Soviet talks aimed at speeding work on a globalban of chemical weapons adjourned Thursday with the chief U.S.representative expressing optimism.   ``I believe a chemical weapons convention, particularly with theemphasis President Bush has put on it, is highly possible withinthe next year or two,'' Max Friedersdorf said in the U.S. Mission'sofficial Daily Bulletin.   Since the Vienna talks on conventional weapons began in March,both sides have praised the spirit of cooperation and expressedhope for speedy agreement. Their positions are close on ceilingsfor some weapons categories.   In the Warsaw Pact draft presented Thursday, Moscow and itsallies proposed a limit of 4,700 combat airplanes each for eachalliance.   They also suggested limits of 20,000 battle tanks and 1,900combat helicopters in an area extending from the Atlantic Ocean tothe Ural Mountains.   NATO proposed ceilings of 5,700 combat airplanes and the samenumbers as the Warsaw Pact for tanks and helicopters, according toreports from within the meeting.   Like the NATO draft, the 40-page Warsaw presentation containedsuggestions for limiting call-ups of reservists and the scope ofmilitary exercises.   This round of negotiations runs through next week. Still to beresolved when the talks resume Jan. 11 is the problem ofdefinitions _ the descriptions of some arms categories.   The Soviet Union insists, for instance, that more than 1,000``air defense interceptors'' protecting defenses around Moscow andthe Urals be excluded from reductions in combat airplanes.   It says the jets are not suitable for either ground attack orsurprise air attack.</TEXT></DOC>
