The foundations have been laid to begin the immunologicstudy of microbes which are non-methanogens themselves but are importantfor the fermentation process. This work helped to make clear that bacterialimmunology goes beyond the study of pathogens for man, animals, or plants.Immunology can be applied successfully to the study of isolates of importanceto understand evolution, phylogeny, ecology, bio-conversion systems,and to advance methanogenic biotechnology. Immunology holds considerablepotential to aid in genetic and genetic engineering manipulations aswell as in in situ handling of microbes relevant to methanogenesis. Thus,antibodies can help in the discovery of useful microbes, the generationof improved stains, the selection of desirable microorganisms, and inthe monitoring and controlling of bioreactors. Immunogolic work in thisnew field should generate knowledge and devices relevant to areas suchas Biological Energy Research, Ecology of Microorganisms, and Environmental(Sanitary) Engineering. In this regard, this work has contributed a comprehensiveantiserum bank, a large panel of calibrated polyclonal antibody probes,and techniques for producing and utilizing these probes in the studyof methanogens and related bacteria. 67 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
