The move, which officials say will save taxpayers hundreds ofmillions of dollars, comes after five years of study, wrangling andcomplaints by losing bidders.   The changeover began during the long Columbus Day weekend at 31government buildings nationwide. Ultimately, more than 1,300locations in 90 federal agencies will be tied to the network whenit is fully installed in mid-1990.   The General Services Administration is overseeing the mammothswitchover with the two prime contractors that won a fierce biddingwar for the project, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and USSprint Communications Co.   Known as FTS2000, for the Federal Telecommunications System2000, the contract may be worth as much as $25 billion over 10years to ATandamp;T and Sprint.   GSA estimates FTS2000 will save taxpayers between $15 millionand $20 million a month for regular telephone service _ or as muchas half of the government's $400 million annual phone bill.   ``The government's phone bill is going to be going downsubstantially, beginning this weekend,'' Michael Corrigan, GSAdeputy commissioner for telecommunications services, said in arecent interview.   ATandamp;T says a five-minute call between Washington and SanFrancisco will cost about 70 cents under FTS2000, compared with$1.40 on ATandamp;T's regular long-distance service or $1.35 on thegovernment's existing network.   FTS2000 replaces a phone system that ATandamp;T installed in 1963. Theold network provided only voice commmunications and low-speed datatransmission.   When FTS2000 is fully in place, federal employees will be ableto communicate with new speed and efficiency over crystal-clear,digital fiber-optic phone lines that transmit information on beamsof laser light.   ATandamp;T and Sprint are banking on federal agencies buyingadditional services such as videoconferencing, high-speed facsimileservice or systems to link large numbers of computers.   FTS2000 is a 10-year, fixed-rate contract that gives thegovernment special low rates to use Sprint's existing publicnetwork and new ATandamp;T lines essentially dedicated to FTS2000,Corrigan said.   Under the contract, which Congress began considering in 1984 andGSA awarded in December, ATandamp;T will serve 60 percent of federalgovernment and Sprint 40 percent. The two companies will re-bid for40 percent of the other's share of the contract during the fourthand seventh years of the agreement.   MCI Communications Corp., the nation's No. 2 long-distancecompany behind ATandamp;T, lost the bidding and has battled in court andat the Federal Communications Commission to overturn the contract.   MCI claimed that ATandamp;T's FTS2000 prices discriminated againstATandamp;T's regular customers and that the prices were below ATandamp;T'scosts.   The FCC rejected MCI's claims.   The new system will make it easier for the government to protectsecrets by using fiber-optic cable, which are buried in the ground.Because they don't use electromagnetic signals, they can't be``tapped'' by normal means.</TEXT></DOC>
