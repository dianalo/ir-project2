At one point Tuesday, Superior Court Judge William Pounders hadthreatened to have the 7-year-old boy's father arrested, butrelented after conferring with him privately.   The judge gave him until next Tuesday to decide whether he willvoluntarily bring his son to Pounders' chambers.   The judge, who has been told the child doesn't want to testify,said he must hear the refusal from the boy before he rules on thematter.   Since the boy's allegations were raised against McMartinPre-school staff members five years ago, his mother has died ofalcohol-related liver disease and brother has died of brain cancer.   Attorneys said the father told the judge any discussion of thecase brings back memories of the deaths of the boy's mother andbrother.   The conflict over the testimony arose on the day prosecutorsrested their case against Raymond Buckey, 30, and his mother, PeggyMcMartin Buckey, 61, who are on trial on 65 molestation andconspiracy charges.   Prosecutors have based their case on the testimony of 11 childwitnesses who told the jury they were subjected to sexual abusewhile attending the Manhattan Beach school, which was shut down in1984.   Defense lawyers were scheduled to begin presenting testimonytoday but declined to disclose their first witness.   Defense attorney Danny Davis told reporters he wanted the boy totestify because: ``The reports we've gotten is that in June 1984,the child reported he was being continuously molested by someonewho was not Raymond Buckey. And Raymond Buckey had been continuallyin jail for three months at that time.''   Prosecutors declined to comment on that statement but said ifthe child were capable of testifying they would have called him asa witness.</TEXT></DOC>
