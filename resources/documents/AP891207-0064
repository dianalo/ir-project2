The move made Lithuania the first Soviet republic to reject theCommunist Party's legal lock on power. It also presented a boldchallenge to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has said thatdemands for more autonomy in some of the 15 republics areendangering his economic reform program.   Gorbachev also has been trying to crack down on the autonomymovements to reassure orthodox Soviet Communists who have beenalarmed by challenges to the Communist Party at home and in severalEastern bloc countries.   Eduardas Potashinskas, a Lithuanian activist who has beenmonitoring the Supreme Soviet's legislative sessions, said the votetoday was 243-1, with 39 abstentions. A vote on the same proposalWednesday fell nine votes short of the two-thirds majority requiredto pass it. The lawmakers decided to vote again today, in partbecause 84 deputies were absent and 30 abstained on Wednesday.   ``During the session (today) of the Supreme Soviet of Lithuania,the 6th article of the constitution of the L.S.S.R. was abolishedand changed into the new formula which declares a multipartysystem,'' the information department of the Lithuanian politicalmovement Sajudis said in a telex statement.   Sajudis spokesmen said new language recognizes that politicalparties and movements are within the legal framework of theLithuanian Constitution.   Article 6, which became part of the basic law of the SovietUnion with the Brezhnev Constitution of 1977, makes the CommunistParty the ``leading and guiding force of Soviet society.''Eliminating it could help reduce the party's grip on on all spheresof life.   The Lithuanian action only affects that republic, and is likelyto face a stiff challenge from Moscow. A similar proposal in theArmenia republic failed Wednesday when the legislature failed todraw a quorum.   The Lithuanian party is moving toward a showdown with theKremlin over its plans to separate from the Soviet Communist Party.Gorbachev has spoken out sharply against that. The Lithuanians havescheduled a Dec. 19 party congress to decide on the issue.   Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Poland and Hungary all recentlydropped similar provisions in their constitutions granting specialstatus to their Communist parties to satisfy pro-democracymovements in their societies.   In Moscow, green photocopied cards have appeared in metrostations and main streets calling for a two-hour general strike onMonday to ask the Congress of People's Deputies to rescind the sameprovision in the national constitution.   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov and five fellow membersof the Soviet parliament signed the appeal.   Sakharov and his fellow deputies are calling for the briefgeneral strike from 10 a.m. to noon on Monday to pressure thenational Congress into voting to rescind Article 6 and on draftlaws on land, property and business enterprises. The Congressstarts its second semi-annual session Tuesday.   ``It is of great importance that Article 6 of the Constitutionbe abandoned,'' Sakharov was quoted as saying by the Soviet newsbulletin Interfax published today. ``We cannot afford to bob in thewake of changes that are taking place in Eastern Europe.''   In Czechoslovakia, the parliamentary action was preceded by asimilar symbolic strike. Czechoslovak strike organizers publicizedtheir plan through massive demonstrations, wall posters, and directorganizing at factories.   Sakharov was quoted by Interfax as saying that dropping theprovision from the Soviet constitution ``is extremely important inchecking the crisis of confidence in the country.''   The Supreme Soviet, a full-time working legislature, is supposedto hammer out new laws, but its parent body, the Congress, mustapprove any changes in the Constitution. The Supreme Soviet votedon a proposal in early November to place consideration of Article 6on the Congressional agenda, but the proposal defeated by a narrowmargin.   The Congress is the centerpiece of President Mikhail S.Gorbachev's political reforms. Its 2,250 deputies were elected lastMarch in the country's first competitive elections in more than 70years.</TEXT></DOC>
