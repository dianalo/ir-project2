Miles, an Elkhart, Ind., unit of the German chemical andpharmaceutical giant Bayer AG, said that its Kogenatetreatment, if approved by the full FDA, would be the firstproduct made by recombinant DNA technology to treathemophilia.</LP><TEXT>   Kogenate, a Factor VIII product, also is its firstbiotechnology product, Miles said. Factor VIII is the proteinnecessary for blood to clot normally; in hemophiliacs it iseither absent or insufficiently present, making control ofbleeding very difficult. Until Kogenate, Miles said, otherFactor VIII products were developed from human blood plasma,which runs the risk of viral infection. There are about20,000 people in the U.S. with the blood disorder.</TEXT></DOC>
