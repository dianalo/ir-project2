During a visit to a Los Angelese community health center, Dr.Pedro Lopez administered a blood pressure test to the Massachusettsgovernor. The reading was 138 over 82, which Lopez described aswithin the normal range although slightly elevated and ``at thehigh end of normal.''   ``There's steadiness,'' Dukakis said of the reading. ``It maynot be a passionate blood pressure but it's steady.''   When Lopez gave the same blood pressure test to Kitty Dukakis,the candidate's wife, the reading was much lower _ 118 over 78.   ``Amazing,'' Dukakis said of the results for his far moreemotional wife.</TEXT></DOC>
