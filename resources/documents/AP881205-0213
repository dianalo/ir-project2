Gorbachev's Soviet Union as a nationof peace.   The top U.S. military commander in Europe calls it ``wishfulthinking.''   On Nov. 22, a British armored unit scrapped plans to enter anorthern town during maneuvers because the townspeople were fed upwith the noise and property damage created by war games.   Three months earlier, a court blocked U.S. Army plans to station36 helicopters outside Wiesbaden. The ruling came amid intense localopposition to the noise caused by American aircraft and forcesalready in the area.   American troops and other forces of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization have been guarding this frontline nation since the endof World War II.   In maneuvers designed to keep the alliance's forces at peakreadiness, NATO tanks rumble across West German farms and as jetaircraft swoop in on low passes.   But West German politicians say they are facing what has become awidespread public perception that Gorbachev, the Soviet president,is a messenger of peace, and an accompanying attitude that perhapsthe hair-trigger military readiness and the resulting inconveniencescan finally be lessened.   ``There is a deep-seated longing for peace. People find the ideaof lowering the military posture very attractive,'' Peter Petersen,a federal lawmaker in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian DemocraticUnion, told The Associated Press.   Petersen says West Germany is a committed NATO partner and thatKohl's government sees the foreign troops in his country as stillnecessary for the security of Western Europe.   But Petersen adds that domestic political pressure for a seriousreduction in low-level NATO jet flights, fewer maneuvers that damageproperty, and other demands cannot be ignored.   Karsten Voigt, a lawmaker with the left-leaning opposition SocialDemocrats, agreed.   ``It is increasingly difficult for politicians of all politicalcolors to defend defensive needs against regional and nationalpressures,'' Voigt said at the Nov. 13-18 Hamburg congress of theNorth Atlantic Assembly, an independent body of lawmakers from the16 NATO nations.   The Social Democrats have taken a harder stance than theChristian Democrats, maintaining that NATO's overall defensestrategy is outdated and needs to be reworked.   U.S. military officials and conservative American politicians inrecent months have been aggressively trying to counteract WestEuropean perceptions of Gorbachev as a peacemaker.   ``We must not get a distorted idea of what is really happening,''Gen. John Galvin, supreme Allied commander in Europe, recently toldreporters. ``Wishful thinking is causing the West to get deeper intoa situation in which support for deterrence may be seriouslythreatened.''   A new West German unease about foreign troops on their soil hasbecome especially apparent during the debate in NATO over``burden-sharing.''   U.S. officials charge that Western Europe is not shouldering itsfair share of NATO's financial burden and are asking West Germanyand other countries to spend more for defense.   The accusation is a sensitive one in West Germany, where about400,000 foreign NATO troops, including 250,000 Americans, are based.   Kohl himself has suggested that his countrymen already endureenough inconvenience because of NATO troops on their soil.   Kohl and other West German officials suggest the United Statesshould not be looking just at dollars and cents when weighing eachNATO nation's contribution to the alliance.   The West Germans say other factors should be assessed as well,such as foreign tanks tearing up farmland and fears among thepopulation caused by low-level flights by military jets.   ``There are 5,000 military exercises in this densely populatedcountry each year,'' said Petersen, the Christian Democrat lawmaker.   ``There's no piece of real estate where you have a greaterconcentration of soldiers and weapons _ including nuclear weapons.   ``The Americans should understand these burdens. We want them tostay here, but they must realize this is a political burden.''   West German unease about foreign troops has increased this yearamid a rash of NATO jet crashes, and the fiery air show disasterAug. 28 at the U.S. Air Force Base in Ramstein.   Thomas Enders, a political scientist at the German Society forForeign Politics, said a recent survey indicated that about 80percent of West Germans backs NATO, but he added that a ``resurgenceof neutralism'' within West Germany could grow with Gorbachev inpower in the Soviet Union.   An poll this past summer indicated that 71 percent of WestGermans had a favorable opinion of Gorbachev, compared with only 41percent for President Reagan.   But Kohl's government assures its transatlantic allies that it isnot convinced the threat from the East has vanished, and that WestGermany is committed to keeping NATO strong.   Said Petersen: ``We're right next door to East Germany, so weknow full well why that is important.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Dec. 12</NOTE></DOC>
