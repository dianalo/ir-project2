Department stores and discounters in the El Paso, Texas,metropolitan area posted the best sales gain for the first half of1989 while Akron, Ohio retailers suffered the worst decline.   These were among the findings in a regional retail sales reportbased on results from 6,000 stores, with at least 25 employees each,in the 125 largest U.S. metropolitan areas. The stores account for$110 billion in annual sales.   The retailers, which regularly submit sales figures to the U.S.Census Bureau, include such national chains as Sears, Roebuck andCo., K mart Corp. and J.C. Penney Co. Inc., mass merchants anddepartment stores.   Using data collected by the Census Bureau, the InternationalCouncil of Shopping Centers is compiling a new monthly report thatcomplements other government retail sales publications. The premierissue, released Wednesday, covered sales for June and the first 6months of 1989.   Ike Lagnado, director of research for the shopping center tradegroup, said the report indicates a region's health because consumerspending at general merchandise stores is a key element of economicactivity.   Nationwide, consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds ofeconomic activity.   Walter Loeb, a retail industry analyst at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.,said at a news conference that the new reports will help analystsdetermine store traffic trends and sales momentum, which are crucialfactors in assessing a retailer's prospects.   According to the report for January through June, the West SouthCentral or ``oil patch'' area of the country, including parts ofTexas, Louisana, Arkansas and Oklahoma, had a sales gain of 11.2percent for the first half from the corresponding 1988 period.   The increase was by far the best of any region and compared witha national median increase of 4.5 percent.   ``Since the oil-dominated economies have suffered through anextended widespread economic contraction, a recent turnaround hasapparently been sufficient to usher in a wave of consumerspending,'' the report read.   The West had a 6.3 percent sales gain in the first half of 1989.On the East Coast, the south Atlantic states showed a growth rate ofonly 1.3 percent and the New England states trailed all otherdivisions within geographic regions, with a 2.6 percent drop insales.   In the Midwest, the report said department store sales rose 4.3percent in the first six months of the year from a year earlier butaccelerated in the second quarter, posting a rise of 5.3 percent.   Among specific metropolitan areas El Paso had a sales rise of18.7 percent in the first half of 1989 to lead gainers, while Akronsales fell by 8 percent to lead the decliners.</TEXT></DOC>
