(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A Corporate Vision For PublishingandM;Electronic publishing is finding itself in the throes of change these days.andO;What may have begun as an exercise in departmental creativity has grown intoa broader discipline involving requirements for corporate data and compliancewith standards.andM;Many companies are beginning to view electronic publishing as anenterprisewide activity with significant cost considerations.andP;  Thestreamlining of the publishing process and the quality of the printed productare keys to a successful electronic publishing strategy.andP;  And so is access tocorporate data.andM;Says David Henry Goodstein, president of InterConsult Inc., an Arlington,Mass., corporate publishing consultant, &quot;It's time corporations vieweddocuments as information in various stages, subject to changes, revisions andedits.andP;  They've got to control that process to have control of theirbusiness,&quot; he declares.andM;To gain that control, companies need to link their electronic publishing withtheir corporate data systems, from the desktop to mainframes.andP;  According toGoodstein, electronic publishing has been too long separated from corporatedata systems.andP;  &quot;Publishing has been isolated in an organization, and desktoppublishing only encouraged that trend,&quot; he notes.andM;Travelers' ApproachandM;One company that is attempting to bring electronic publishing into thecorporate mainstream is Hartford, Conn.-based The Travelers Corp., where anintegrated approach to electronic publishing is now getting off the ground.andM;&quot;We want to control our publishing tasks from the tree to the mailbox,&quot; saysRobert Bennett, second vice president at The Travelers, &quot;From the time one ofour business units has a creative thought about a product they want toproduce, through the time the product leaves The Travelers' premises andenters into the distribution system ...andP;  we want to, whenever possible,electronify that process and eliminate manual intervention.&quot;andM;Bennett sees electronic publishing as one of many technologies his group,Data Processing's computer science division, is bringing into the company.andO;&quot;Electronic publishing has become one of those technologies that offers costsavings to the company.andM;&quot;In 1988, we spent close to $300 million on printing and publishing&quot;continues Bennett.andP;  &quot;Of that, 15% was really data-center or printing-centerprinting and 85% was associated with all the other things that have to goon--weighing, storage, people that sort mail--in the printing and publishingprocess.andP;  We can cut a significant portion of that through the development ofelectronic publishing.&quot;andM;Travelers has just begun to implement its electronic publishing visionthroughout the company.andP;  Most of the company's documents, which consist ofsuch items as insurance policies, contracts and brochures, are created at theworkstation level in a Travelers' field office, either with an IBM PC AT orPS/2 using Xerox Corp.'s Ventura composition software.andP;  Most of the PCs areon token ring local area networks.andP;  Forms are printed on a laser printer.andO;When a document must be moved from one workstation to another location,either for viewing, approval or printing, Travelers employs its nationwide T1network, which connects all of the field offices to each other and tocorporate headquarters in Hartford.andP;  &quot;So we're now in a position where we canhave the experts compose and approve the documents and then electronicallytransmit the documents to their proper place for printing,&quot; Bennett says.andM;Those who create documents in field offices often need information fromcorporate headquarters.andP;  Using the T1 network, they are able to access thecompany's IBM mainframes.andP;  &quot;We believe our two-tier architecture is veryimportant in making this happen,&quot; Bennett says.andP;  &quot;We have the intelligentterminals out in the field, and they do a portion of the processing there.andO;Then the information that's held on the mainframes is added when the fieldinformation is sent in.&quot;andM;Although Travelers uses some inhouse software for accessing corporate data,the company has mainly relied on off-the-shelf programs for this purpose.andO;Bennett hopes to find more off-the-shelf solutions as the company continuesto integrate its electronic publishing.andM;The Influence of CALSandM;Electronic publishing hasn't escaped the computer industry's currentstandards fervor.andP;  And one of the prime movers in the standards area is, notunexpectedly, the government.andM;One of the most mature elements of the U.S.andP;  Department of Defense'sComputer-Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support (CALS) program has been thedevelopment and identification of electronic publishing standards.andP;  CALSdefines standards for the electronic exchange of information by identifyinghow various elements of a document, such as headings and chapter titles,relate to each other within that document.andP;  Currently, CALS is limited totext and graphics documents, but will eventually include the electronicexchange of entire databases.andP;  CALS standards function at Layer 6(presentation) and Layer 7 (application) of the Open Systems Interconnection(OSI) model.andM;The Defense Department views ditigal document interchange as a major step incutting the escalating costs of weapons systems.andP;  Why is CALS important tothis goal?andP;  An oft told joke among military aircraft suppliers illustrates itwell enough: How do you know when you've finished building your militaryaircraft?andP;  When the paperwork outweighs the plane.andM;An equally perplexing problem is that much of that weighty documentation isout of date--critical when repair is involved.andP;  &quot;There's an enormous amountof information flowing through the DOD, and it's estimated that fullyone-fourth of that information in the department's documentation andmaintenance manuals is obsolete and outdated,&quot; says John Giudice, publishingsolutions manager in Nashua, N.H., for Maynard, Mass.-based Digital EquipmentCorp.andM;Many problems are caused when converting documents from one computerenvironment to another.andP;  These should virtually be eliminated using the CALSstandard, according to Giudice.andP;  In addition, the ability to transmit acomplete technical document across various computing platforms should add upto further savings, he says.andM;Some computer companies have pledged allegiance to the CALS standard at thesame time they've been moving toward more open publishing systems.andM;Digital, for instance, has introduced it's Compound Document Architecture(CDA).andP;  The goal of CDA is to allow companies to obtain an exchangeinformation from anywhere in their company across any operating system.andO;Three Digital cooperative-marketing program vendors are currently providingconversion software for the program--Interleaf Inc., Xyvision Inc. andDatalogics Inc.andP;  These programs can convert current VAX word processors intothe CALS text format or allow a document prepared on a VAX to be used as partof a CALS document.andM;In the long term, however, the goal is to create CALS-compliant documents,rather than having to convert them.andP;  That will come as CALS begins to makeits mark in the electronic publishing field, he says.andP;  &quot;Lots of our customersare doing business with the government, so CALS compliance will be necessaryto compete in this business before long,&quot; he says.andM;The Evolution of a StandardandM;At present, CALS standards simply have incorporated existing electronicpublishing standards, says Bruce Lepisto, deputy director of the Departmentof Defense's CALS policy office.andP;  Current CALS standards appear to be anamalgam of previously published specifications, including SGML (StandardGeneralized Markup Language) for text, GGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) forgraphics, IGES (Initial Graphics Exchange Specification) for CAD and CCITTPhase 4 for raster images.andP;  Future implementations of CALS will move beyondelectronic publishing to encompass exchange of information through a databasestandard.andM;Even if a company is not doing business with the government, the basic tenetsbehind CALS are good for business, says Dave Scott, marketing manager forDeere Technical Services, the systems integration unit of Moline, Ill.-basedDeere andamp; Co.andP;  &quot;The standards will be good for the industry even if, currently,they're just codifying existing standards,&quot; he says.andM;As the systems integration partner for the manufacturing trade show Autofact'89 Partnership for Integration project, Deere learned firsthand theimportance of standards.andP;  &quot;We couldn't have done this as easily just twoyears ago because of the lack of networking standards in the industry,&quot; Scottsays.andP;  Partnership for Integration was a live demonstration of automatedmanufacturing exhibited at last November's Autofact exhibition.andP;  But besidessimply showing computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) in action, the actualdocuments used for manufacturing were also included.andM;Deere tied the enterprise host machine, an IBM mainframe, in with AppleComputer Inc. Macintoshes running Interleaf software.andP;  Communicating througha Prime Computer Inc. mini-computer, the Macintosh keeps tabs on updatedengineering data for a parts catalog of the lawn and garden tractor partsmanufactured at the exhibition.andP;  It prints the new information using AldusCorp.'s PageMaker software on an Apple Laser Writer II printer.andP;  To Scott,this kind of integration is vital for manufacturing companies that want tostay alive in the 1990s.andP;  &quot;Keeping the most up-to-date information availablethroughout your organization is absolutely necessary.andP;  It really wasn'tpossible before, or at least it wasn't possible without a hell of a lot ofwork, and to be honest, most manufacturers didn't do it,&quot; he says.andM;Manufacturers are finding uses for electronic publishing that go beyondkeeping up-to-date information on replacement parts.andP;  Automated documentationhas been the missing link in even the most automated of factories.andP;  Once adesign is ready for production, drawings are sent out, accompanied by setupand assembly instructions, method sheets, work orders, inventory slips,routing slips and modifications--all on paper.andP;  This method is like a petridish for errors.andM;As computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided engineering (CAE) andnumerical control technologies have found their way into manufacturing,documentation has been left behind, Scott says.andP;  The technology to handledocumentation is still somewhat behind both CAD and CAE, lacking the abilityto efficiently store and manipulate both graphics and large blocks of text inthe same database.andP;  But progress has been made, Scott says.andP;  Both theAutofact exhibit and Deere use a program called Intelligent Documentation(ID) from Cimlinc Inc. of Itasca, Ill.andM;ID combines text and graphics connecting directly with a company's CAD/CAEsystems and sends the images down to the factory floor.andP;  Previously, threeforms from the company's hierarchical database machines, containingextraneous information sans graphics, were used.andP;  First, the information wasreorganized into an Oracle Corp. relational database, then moved to a SunMicrosystems Inc. workstation operating on a network with links to thecompany's CAD systems.andP;  That allowed drawings to be included with the plans.andO;The ID system queries the relational and CAD databases for the informationneeded, Scott says.andM;How does that system fit with the electronic publishing system?andP;  The goal ofboth is the same, Scott says.andP;  &quot;The idea is to get accurate information fromanywhere in the company and have it available to anyone who is authorized toit.andP;  Electronic publishing will have to do the same thing in the future,&quot; hesays.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
