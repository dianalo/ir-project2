But don't plan on visiting Old City Hall. It's closed.</LP><TEXT>   Not far away is the handsome Second Bank of the UnitedStates, over which bank president Nicholas Biddle andPresident Andrew Jackson waged a famous fight in 1832. Now ithouses dozens of paintings of the nation's founding fathersby Charles Willson Peale and his son, Rembrandt. Don't planto look at the portraits either. The bank building is alsoclosed.   Independence Hall itself -- the place, according toAbraham Lincoln, &quot;where were collected together the wisdom,the patriotism, the devotion to principle from which sprangthe institutions under which we live&quot; -- remains open. Butthe roof was discovered to be leaking recently, and emergencyrepairs were made barely in time to keep water from drippinginto the rooms where the nation began.   In all, eight of Independence National Historical Park's19 buildings are closed &quot;until further notice.&quot; At least 11fountains have been turned off. An open park-within-a-park isso rubble-strewn that signs warn visitors to &quot;enter at yourown risk.&quot;   &quot;Its disgraceful condition is a blot on the image ofAmerica,&quot; says City Councilman James Tayoun, whose districtincludes the park. &quot;It looks like something you might find inMoscow.&quot;   This park is run by the National Park Service, a part ofthe Interior Department, and is supposed to be maintained bytaxpayer dollars. &quot;We need $9 million to run this park everyyear,&quot; says Hobart G. Cawood, park superintendent. &quot;For thepast seven or eight years, we've gotten about $7 million. Wehave had to defer routine maintenance and close some of ourbuildings.&quot;   What's happening here is a not-so-new paradigm of agovernment that is often unable to set national priorities ordifferentiate between what's significant and what's merelypolitically rewarding.   The problem is neatly wrapped up in the story of two parkunits maintained by the National Park Service inPennsylvania, barely 100 miles apart. Independence park, herein Philadelphia, struggles to find money to fix leaking roofsand rotting window sills. Steamtown National Historic Site inScranton, containing the remains of the old Delaware,Lackawanna andamp; Western railroad yard, has collected $43 millionin taxpayer cash in less than five years to maintain whatJohn H. White Jr., retired transportation curator at theSmithsonian Institution, calls &quot;a third-rate collection in aplace to which it has no relevance.&quot;   More than five million tourists visit Independence parkannually; Steamtown attracts about 100,000.   Visitors to Philadelphia sense, intuitively, what's goingon. &quot;It's a classic case of political clout,&quot; says Zev Nash,a tourist from San Francisco. &quot;The ones with the biggestclout get the bucks and the rest of us don't get any sayabout it.&quot;   Mr. Nash isn't far off the mark. Steamtown's engineer isGOP Congressman Joseph McDade, who is under criminalinvestigation by a federal grand jury for allegedly receivingillegal campaign contributions. Money to open Steamtownmagically appeared in the 1986 federal budget without everbeing considered by appropriate committees in either theHouse or the Senate. Mr. McDade slipped it through,unbeknownst to the Park Service, in a conference report thatwas supposed to just iron out differences between the Houseand Senate versions of the budget. Steamtown has been gettingall the money it needs ever since, and is widely seen in thecongressman's district as an economic windfall.   Over the past decade or so, says chief Park Servicespokesman Duncan Morrow, members of Congress haveincreasingly seized from the executive branch the role ofdeciding the location of new units within the system and ofallocating the funds to support those already in operation.   Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia wheedled morethan $4 million in taxpayer cash to restore an old movietheater back home in Huntington. Democratic Sen. FrankLautenberg of New Jersey drew up the legislation thatprovided $1.5 million to buy Newark Symphony Hall. &quot;We don'tknow what {the hall is} for, or even who's supposed to getthe money,&quot; says Mr. Morrow.   The latest addition to the nation's park system is theWeir Farm National Historic Site in Wilton, Conn., the homeof a somewhat obscure painter named Julian Alden Weir.Democratic Congressman Sam Gejdenson pushed it through byjoining hands with representatives from Utah. Mr. Weir'sdaughter, it turns out, married Brigham Young's grandson.   Park Service officials protested that Mr. Weir wasn't aprominent enough artist to deserve this kind of recognition.But they backed down when Mr. Weir's supporters produced J.Carter Brown, director of the National Gallery of Art, totestify to Mr. Weir's skills. Then, as now, the gallery hasin its collection only one Weir painting, &quot;Moonlight.&quot; It'sin storage.   Mr. Gejdenson is now trying to create within the ParkService a &quot;National Heritage Corridor&quot; for old mill townsthat dot two river valleys in his district. His Democraticcolleague, John Murtha, has put together something calledAmerica's Industrial Heritage that straddles nine counties inhis home district in central Pennsylvania. It includes thenation's first aluminum mill.   The legislation that appropriates money for Park Serviceprojects is known in Washington as &quot;little pork&quot;; thelegislation that appropriates money for energy and waterprojects is &quot;big pork.&quot; The Park Service itself is sometimescalled the &quot;Pork&quot; Service.   While all of this pork was being carved up, Independencepark was falling apart. Mr. Cawood, who has been runningthings here for 19 years and is widely praised by hiscolleagues in the park service, says he has done what hecould -- but it hasn't been easy.   &quot;During the Reagan administration,&quot; says Mr. Cawood,&quot;national parks didn't have very high priority. We were toldwe were never to ask for more money.&quot;   He hoped things might improve under President Bush and, infact, park superintendents were told they could ask for moremoney for operating expenses. Mr. Cawood, delighted, made hispitch -- only to be turned down flat by his own regionalheadquarters, located, ironically enough, smack in the middleof his own decaying park. &quot;We ended up 90th on the prioritylist in our own {Mid-Atlantic} region,&quot; says Mr. Cawood.   So Mr. Cawood adopted a kind of enclave strategy, closingoff whole blocks at the extremities of the park andwithdrawing to the core. Then the roof began leaking inIndependence Hall.   That helped. Democratic Congressman Thomas Foglietta,whose district includes the park, successfully pushedCongress to come up with $654,000 to repair the roof andrestore the rubble-strewn park north of Independence Hall.   Mr. Foglietta says he would have acted sooner if he hadknown how serious the problems were. Superintendent Cawood,he says, &quot;never told me about this in person,&quot; even thoughthe two men live only a block apart in Philadelphia.   Stopgap repairs are under way. But there is still nolong-range solution to the park's woes, and it will be monthsbefore there may be enough money to open for a month or twoOld City Hall or the museums that honor the Army and the Navyand the Marine Corps, all of which sprang into life here, orDolley Madison's home or even the house, a restoration, whereThomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence.</TEXT></DOC>
