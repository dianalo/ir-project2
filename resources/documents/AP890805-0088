But even after an agonizing week in which his brother was undera death sentence by his Moslem captors for several days, Cicippiois certain the hostages will be freed one day.   ``I think if the U.S. and all of the other governments wouldstick together now, I'm sure they'll be able to end the hostagesituation,'' Thomas Cicippio said Friday from Norristown.   He said his family planned to spend the weekend trying to gettheir lives back on an even keel after a week in which another U.S.hostage was reported hanged, four deadlines for Joseph's death wereset and then canceled, his wife made an extraordinary plea for herhusband's safety, and Joseph appealed in a videotape for therelease of a Lebanese clergyman seized by Israel last month.   ``Life must go on,'' Thomas Cicippio said. ``Of course, wealways think about Joseph. There's no way you can do anythingwithout thinking about Joe.''   Joseph Cicippio was on his way to work as acting comptroller ofthe American University in Beirut when he was kidnapped Sept. 12,1986.   On Monday, the Revolutionary Justice Organization said it wouldkill him if Israel did not free Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, the ShiiteMoslem spiritual leader Israeli commandos captured in Lebanon onJuly 28.   The threat to Cicippio came shortly after another pro-Iraniangroup claimed it had hanged Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins inretaliation for Israel's action. A videotape that seemed to showthe body of Higgins hanging from a noose was issued, but no bodyhas been found and some reports have said he was killed months ago.   Elham Ghandour Cicippio, whom Joseph married in 1985, pleadedTuesday for the captors to ``review their consciences and stop fromcarrying out'' the killing.   The captors' first deadline, 11 a.m. EDT Tuesday, was pushedback four hours and then until Thursday. The captors said they wereresponding to ``friendly appeals'' and the plea from Mrs. Cicippio.   By Thursday, when the new deadline approached, scores ofjournalists were trampling the lawn outside Thomas Cicippio'ssuburban split-level home. Early in the day, it was extended threehours, and a videotaped message with Joseph Cicippio urging Obeid'srelease was made public in Beirut.   Just before 2 p.m., the captors said they had called off thekilling and replaced it with demands that Israel free Palestinianand Lebanese prisoners. They said they would provide a list to theRed Cross.   The news made the Cicippio family jubilant. ``We were all soextremely happy,'' Thomas Cicippio said. ``It was just a case ofjoy and tears and kisses and hugs and everything else.''   But he stressed that the family's ordeal won't end even if hisbrother is freed.   ``What it would really take is not only to have Joseph knock onmy front door, but to have all of the hostages be able to go homeand knock on their own front door,'' he said. ``We can't forget therest of the hostages. They're all a part of us now.''   ``Most of all I'd like to see Lt. Col. Higgins come back and beable to knock on his front door,'' Cicippio said. ``I have afeeling that the colonel is still alive.''   Not counting Higgins, 16 Westerners including eight Americansare believed to be held captive in Lebanon. Held longest is TerryA. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The AssociatedPress, who was seized March 16, 1985.   Cicippio said he felt no rancor toward his brother's captors.   ``Joseph is still alive,'' he said. ``If he wasn't alive, it maybe a different story. All of the other American hostages, as far asI know, are still alive. So there's no way I can say I hate them.''   And Cicippio said he didn't mind what the journalists had doneto his lawn.   ``Perhaps they can all come back tomorrow and retrample it,'' hesaid. ``I don't care if we have twice as many people come, that isif we get word that Joseph is free.''</TEXT></DOC>
