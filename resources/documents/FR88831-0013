Because this rule concerns a foreign and military affairs function ofthe United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the meaning ofsection 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirementsof that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final Regulatory Impact Analysishas to be or will be prepared.2. This rule mentions a collection of information subject to the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This collection has been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget under Control Number 0625-0001.3. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility analysishas to be or will be prepared.4. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA)(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EAA does notrequire that this rule be published in proposed form because this ruledoes not impose a new control. Further, no other law requires that a noticeof proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given forthis rule.5. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although there is noformal comment period, public comments on this regulation are welcome ona continuing basis. Comments should be submitted to Willard Fisher, Officeof Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Departmentof Commerce, P.O.
