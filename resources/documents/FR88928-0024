The March 9 documentdealt with the establishment of hunting seasons, hours, areas and limitsfor migratory game birds under andSection;andSection; 20.101 through 20.107,20.109 and 20.110 of Subpart K. On June 7, 1988, the Service publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 20874) a second document consisting ofa supplemental proposed rulemaking dealing with both the early- and late-seasonframework. On July 11, 1988, the Service published for public comment inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 26198) a third document consisting ofa proposed rulemaking dealing specifically with frameworks for early-seasonmigratory bird hunting regulations. That document also reopened and extendedthe comment period for the proposed frameworks for Alaska, Puerto Ricoand the Virgin Islands from June 22, 1988, to July 20, 1988. All threedocuments, March 9, June 7, and July 11, indicated that special considerationwas being given to possible restrictive regulations for all aspects ofthe 1988-89 hunting season dependent upon the continuing poor status ofducks. On August 9, 1988, the Service published a fourth document (53 FR29897) containing final frameworks for early migratory bird hunting seasonsfrom which wildlife conservation agency officials from the States, PuertoRico and the Virgin Islands selected early-season hunting dates, hours,areas and limits for 1988-89. The fifth document in the series, publishedAugust 12, 1988, in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 30622), deals specifically with proposedframeworks for the 1988-89 late-season migratory bird hunting regulations.On August 31, 1988, the Service published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 33792) a sixth document consisting ofa final rule amending Subpart K of Title 50 CFR Part 20 to set huntingseasons, hours, areas and limits for mourning doves, white-winged and white-tippeddoves, band-tailed pigeons, rails, woodcock, common snipe, and common moorhenand purple gallinules; sea ducks in certain defined areas of the AtlanticFlyway; wood ducks in September in Florida, Kentucky and Tennessee; Canadageese in September in portions of Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota; sandhillcranes in the Central and Pacific Flyways; a special Canada goose seasonin southwestern Wyoming; migratory game birds in Alaska, Hawaii, PuertoRico and the Virgin Islands; and extended falconry seasons. On September16, 1988, the Service published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>a seventh document (53 FR 36033) consisting ofa final rulemaking for the late-season frameworks for migratory game birdhunting regulations from which State wildlife conservation agency officialsselected late season hunting dates, hours, areas, and limits for 1988-89.The final rule described here is the eighth in a series of proposed, supplemental,and final rulemaking documents for migratory game bird hunting regulationsand deals specifically with amending Subpart K of 50 CFR Part 20 to sethunting seasons, hours, areas and limits for species subject to late huntingregulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Nontoxic Shot Regulations </ITAG>In the June 28, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 24284), the Service published a finalrule describing zones in which use of lead shot would be prohibited forhunting waterfowl, coots and certain other species in the 1988-89 huntingseason. Waterfowl hunters are advised to become familiar with State andlocal regulations regarding the use of nontoxic shot for waterfowl hunting.<ITAG tagnum="84">NEPA Consideration </ITAG>NEPA considerations are covered by the programmatic document, ``Final SupplementalEnvironmental Impact Statement: Issuance of Annual Regulations Permittingthe Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FSES 88-14)'', filed with CEQ onJune 9, 1988. Notices of Availability were published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22582), and June 17,1988 (53 FR 22727), and the Service's Record of Decision was publishedon August 18, 1988 (53 FR 31341).<ITAG tagnum="84">Endangered Species Act Consideration </ITAG>Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act provides that, ``The Secretaryshall review other programs administered by him and utilize such programsin furtherance of the purposes of this Act'' (and shall) ``insure thatany action authorized, funded or carried out * * * is not likely to jeopardizethe continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or resultin the destruction or modification of (critical) habitat * * *''. Subsequently, the Service initiated section 7 consultation under the EndangeredSpecies Act for the proposed hunting season frameworks.  On June 17, 1988, the Division of Endangered Species and Habitat Conservationgave a biological opinion that the proposed actions were not likely tojeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result in the destructionor adverse modification of their critical habitats. As in the past, hunting regulations this year are designed, among otherthings, to remove or alleviate chances of conflict between seasons formigratory game birds and the protection and conservation of endangeredand threatened species. The Service's biological opinion resulting from its consultation undersection 7 is considered a public document and is available for inspectionin the Office of Endangered Species and the Office of Migratory Bird Management,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, Washington,DC 20240.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Order 12291 and the PaperworkReduction Act </ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> dated March 9, 1988 (53 FR 7702), the Servicereported measures it had undertaken to comply with requirements of theRegulatory Flexibility Act and the Executive Order. These included preparinga Determination of Effects and an updated Final Regulatory Impact Analysis,and publication of a summary of the latter. These regulations have beendetermined to be major under Executive Order 12291 and they have a significanteconomic impact on substantial numbers of small entities under the RegulatoryFlexibilty Act. This determination is detailed in the aforementioned documentswhich are available upon request from the Office of Migratory Bird Management,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, Washington,DC 20240. These regulations contain no information collections subjectto Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of1980.<ITAG tagnum="84">Memorandum of Law </ITAG>The Service published its Memorandum of Law, required by section 4 of ExecutiveOrder 12291, in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>dated August 9, 1988 (53 FR 29897).<ITAG tagnum="84">Authorship </ITAG>The primary author of this final rule is Morton M. Smith, Office of MigratoryBird Management, working under the direction of Rollin D. Sparrowe, Chief.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulations Promulgation </ITAG>After analysis of the migratory game bird survey data obtained throughinvestigations conducted by the Service, State conservation agencies, andother sources, and consideration of all comments received on the late seasonproposals (53 FR 7702, March 9, 1988; 53 FR 20874, June 7, 1988; and 53FR 30622, August 12, 1988), the Service published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on September 16, 1988 (53 FR 36033) final late-seasonframeworks. Copies of the proposed and final frameworks were sent to theofficials of the State conservation agencies who were invited to submitrecommendations for hunting seasons which complied with the season timesand lengths, hours, areas, and limits specified in the final frameworks.Among these recommendations, the State of Maryland selected a one-birdlimit, rather than take the full two birds allowed under the frameworks,for the first 15 days of the goose season. The Service has long since recognized,consistent with 16 U.S.C. 708, that States need not avail themselves ofthe maximums dictated by annual Federal frameworks. Local resource needsand the health of portions of a population using a particular area mayrequire stricter local controls than prevail elsewhere in a flyway. Survivalrates for Maryland geese have fallen to 63 percent, below the 70 percentconsidered necessary to maintain a stable population, and wintering populationshave declined at least 34 percent since the mid-1970's. These facts, combinedwith the strong tendency of Maryland geese to return in subsequent years,justify the State's choice of less than the allowable bag limit. The taking of the designated species of migratory birds is prohibited unlessopen hunting seasons are specifically provided. The following amendmentwill permit taking of the designated species within specified time periodsbeginning as early as September 26 and will benefit the public by relievingexisting restrictions. The rulemaking process for migratory game bird hunting, must, by its nature,operate under severe time constraints. However, the Service intends thatthe public be given the greatest possible opportunity to comment on theregulations. Thus, when proposed rulemakings were published on March 9,June 7, and August 12, 1988, the Service established what it believed werethe longest periods possible for public comment. In doing this, the Servicerecognized that when the comment period closed time would be of the essence.That is, if there were a delay in the effective date of these regulationsafter this final rulemaking, the States would have insufficient time toselect their season dates, shooting hours, hunting areas, and limits; tocommunicate those selections to the Service; and to establish and publicizethe necessary regulations and procedures to implement their decisions.The Service therefore finds that ``good cause'' exists, within the termsof 5 U.S.C.(d)(3) (Administrative Procedure Act), and these regulationswill, therefore, take effective immediately upon publication.Accordingly, each State conservation agency having had an opportunity toparticipate in selecting the hunting seasons desired for its State on thosespecies of migratory brids for which open seasons are now to be prescribed,and consideration having been given to all other relevant matters presented,certain sections of Title 50, Chapter I, Subchapter B, Part 20, SubpartK, are hereby corrected and amended as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 20</ITAG>Exports, Hunting, Imports, Transportation, Wildlife.For the reasons set out in the preamble, Title 50, Chapter I, SubchapterB, Part 20, Subpart K is amended as follows.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 20_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
