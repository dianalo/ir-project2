The development and management plan and related EA will addresslong-term wildlife management objectives, public use, new structural developments,water management, and additional land acquisition. The EA will evaluatealternatives and disclose environmental impacts of the plan. This noticeis prepared as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)Regulations (40 CFR 1501.7) to obtain suggestions and information fromother agencies and the public on the scope of issues and alternatives tobe addressed in the EA.

Telephone: (801) 723-5887.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Service and Department of the Interior,propose to prepare a development and management plan and associated EAfor the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge near Brigham City, Utah. The planwill establish wildlife and wetland management objectives, wetland preservationand public use objectives, identify needs for structural developments,water management development, educational, public use development, andwetland habitat acquisition. The EA will evaluate the alternatives anddisclose environmental impacts of the plan. The Service has identifiedthe concept of a $23 million restoration, development, and land acquisitionplan. About 38,000 acres are being considered for addition to the refuge.Fee and easement acquisition will be considered.The Service is initiating this action subsequent to major flood damagecaused by the rise of the Great Salt Lake. Many structural developmentsat the refuge were severely damaged or destroyed by the flood. Wetlandsof international significance to millions of shorebirds, waterfowl, andmarsh birds are beginning to recover from the flood. The Service is nowreevaluating the purposes of the existing refuge and the value of wetlandsadjacent to the refuge to establish a long-term plan for development, management,and protection of lands at the Bear River delta.The primary identified alternatives are:(1) <T3>No Action:</T3> The Service would manage the existing refuge for migratorybirds and restore only existing management structures. No land acquisitionwould occur.(2) <T3>Abandonment:</T3> The Service would abandon the refuge. This may includemanagement by other entities.(3) <T3>Enhanced Management for Migratory Birds:</T3> This alternative wouldfocus on the continued management emphasis for migratory waterfowl, shorebirds,and marsh birds with only limited management objectives for public usesand wetland ecosystem values. New development will focus on developmentwithin existing refuge. No land acquisition would occur.(4) <T3>Enhanced Management for Migratory, Birds, Wetland Ecosystem and PublicUse Values:</T3> This alternative would broaden management objectives beyondmigratory birds where possible. Public uses such as wildlife observation,education, interpretation, and hunting would be more common and receivemanagement emphasis along with migratory birds. This alternative includesland acquisition for multiple resource values. Acquisition could includefee and easement.The concept of acquiring additional land near Bear River Refuge was identifiedin the 1970's by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources and the Service.The Service considered an attempt to acquire one ownership in the 1970'sbut was not successful. Management emphasis of the existing refuge andadjacent land has not been methodically evaluated since the Refuge establishmentin 1928.Major impacts of the development, management, and acquisition alternativescould be:andbullet; Increased protection of wetland and wildlife resources.andbullet; Increased access and use by people.andbullet; Loss of waterfowl and migratory bird habitat to public uses anddevelopments.andbullet; Increased disturbance of waterfowl and migratory birds from increasedpublic uses.andbullet; Competition with agriculture and municipal interest for water.andbullet; Increased economic stimulus to local economy with public usesand development.andbullet; More protection of wetland ecosystem values.andbullet; Loss of agriculture production with land acquisition.The environmental review of this project will be conducted in accordancewith the requirements of the NEPA, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4371 <T3>et seq.</T3>), NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1500-1508), and other appropriateFederal regulations, and Service procedures for compliance with those regulations.We expect the draft plan and EA to be available to the public by April1990.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Galen Buterbaugh,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4"><T3>Regional Director.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-27617 Filed 11-24-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4310-55-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
