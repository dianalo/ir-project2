The army will issue special permits allowing some of the 700,000Gaza Strip residents into Israel, and may expand the measure to 1million Palestinians on the occupied West Bank, military officialssaid.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin indicated leaders of the uprisingwill be denied permits.   Leftist lawmakers warned the restrictions could stir newviolence, and some employers feared they could have a negativeimpact on Israel's economy.   In the occupied territories, troops killed two young Arabs.   They shot and fatally wounded 20-year-old Imran Najib Amer andAbdel Razik Abu Khollah, 22, Arab hospital officials said. The armysaid Amer was among masked Palestinians who blocked a West Bankroad and that he was shot as he tried to grab a soldier's rifle.They said they were checking the report on Khollah, who officialssaid died in a clash with troops in Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp.   Their deaths bring the toll to 484 Palestinians killed in the17-month revolt. Twenty-one Israelis also have been killed.   In other confrontations Thursday, troops shot and wounded atleast 26 Palestinians, Arabs and hospital officials said. The armyconfirmed three wounded.   Most of the occupied lands were paralyzed by a general strikecalled by the Moslem fundamentalist movement Hamas, or Zeal, toprotest alleged Israeli interference with mosques.   Army commanders say they avoid entering mosques, but they closeoff access to some when they anticipate hostile crowds.   The army Thursday partially lifted a general curfew that hadrestricted Gaza Strip residents to their homes since Monday.   But officers reimposed the curfew Thursday night ``for nospecial reason,'' according to an army spokesman. It would last``until further notice,'' he said.   Military officers say the Gaza closure and permit requirementsare to punish Palestinians for anti-Israeli activities.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, an architect of the plan, said onIsrael television Thursday that the Palestinians ``must choosebetween the intefadeh (uprising) and the path of peace.''   He told leaders of his right-wing Likud bloc Wednesday thatCabinet approval of a peace initiative means Israel now can taketougher measures against violence.   ``When you have a peace initiative in one hand, the other isfreer to strike at the rioters,'' Shamir said.   In an interview Thursday, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin saidthe aim is ``to deliver a message to the Palestinians thatstone-throwing, petrol-bombing and other means of violence do notchange a bit the Israeli political position.''   Military officials said they will use the new permits to barGaza Strip residents convicted of serious crimes. Some 28,000Palestinians have been convicted of crimes in Israel in the past 10years, officials said.   Rabin indicated ringleaders in the revolt also would not getpermits.   He said the army could start issuing permits by the end of Mayand expected the process to be completed within three months.   They might expande restrictions to the West Bank ``to make thePalestinians in Gaza and later on the West Bank realize that theright to leave the territories is a privilege,'' he said.   ``There are too many sectors of Israel's economy which havebecome, in my humble opinion, too dependent on the workers who comefrom the territories,'' Rabin said.   Restrictions will most affect 50,000 Gazan and 60,000 West Bankresidents working in Israel in construction, farming, municipalservices, hotels and factories.   In 1987, Palestinians working in Israel earned $700 million,about one third of the gross national produce of the occupiedterritories, Rabin said.   Finance Minister Shimon Peres, head of Rabin's center-left LaborParty, said Israel could not keep all work from Palestiniansbecause it would create ``more bitterness and resistance.''   Israeli industrialists fear the new measures will leave themshort of labor. Some have appealed for permits to bring low-wageworkers from abroad, including Lebanon and Portugal.   ``The construction industry is in a catastrophic situation,''Aharon Sapir, director-general of the Contractors Association, saidon Israel radio. Members of his association employ 40,000Palestinians, about half their work force.   Left-wing legislators condemned the new crackdown, which YossiSarid of the Citizens Rights Movement described as ``stupid,unjust, ineffective and immoral.''</TEXT></DOC>
