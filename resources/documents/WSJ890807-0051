In a lawsuit brought in March 1988, the state challenged a leasing arrangement devised in 1934 by a Midland, Texas, oil man on a 24-acre tract in the Yates field. When the state sold the land years ago, it retained the mineral rights and became entitled to half the royalties from mineral production on the land.    In its suit, Texas argued that the oil man's leasing arrangement cheated it out of its fair share of royalties, which go to the state's Permanent School Fund.    Under the settlement, the state received $2.7 million immediately and estimates it will receive as much as $35 million more during the 50-year future life of the Yates Field. </TEXT></DOC>
