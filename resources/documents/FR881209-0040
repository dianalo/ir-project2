Recent developments relatedto drought conditions and elevated water temperatures were examined andfound to be adequately addressed by the fish and water management agencies.The relevant Federal and State agencies are fulfilling their commitmentsto alleviate the habitat problems that are preventing the winter run fromreturning to its historically high population levels. The major actionsthat would likely be included in a recovery plan for this population arebeing implemented. Therefore, NMFS finds that the existing State and Federalprograms for managing winter-run chinook salmon in the Sacramento Riverare effecting remedies to restore the run, are adequately managing thethreats to the population, and are flexible enough to respond to naturalthreats such as drought in a responsible manner. Further, NMFS concludesthat the winter run is not likely to become endangered in the foreseeablefuture throughout all or a significant portion of its range (i.e., thewinter run is not a threatened species).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>James H.

NMFS reviewed the petition anddetermined that it contained substantial information indicating that thepetitioned action might be warranted. On February 13, 1986, NMFS announcedits intention to conduct a review of the status of the run to determinewhether or not listing the run was appropriate.The status review was based on a consideration of available informationon the run relative to the five criteria specified in section 4(a)(1) ofthe ESA and a consideration of the conservation efforts of the State ofCalifornia and Federal resource management agencies to restore the run,as required by section 4(b)(1)(A) of the ESA. Information was providedby the petitioner, the State, Federal agencies that affect the run or itshabitat, and the public. The results of the status review, along with theNotice of Determination, were published on February 27, 1987 (52 FR 6041).In the Notice of Determination, NMFS determined that the Sacramento Riverwinter-run chinook was a species in the context of the ESA, recognizedthat the run had declined over a period of less than two decades, and wasapproaching a level below which genetic diversity might diminish. The primarycausal agents in this decline were the construction and operation of adiversion dam at Red Bluff and other human activities that had collectivelydegraded spawning and rearing habitat to the point that productivity ofthe run declined.Based on its assessment that restoration and conservation efforts whichwere being implemented or planned by State and Federal resource managementagencies adequately provided for the rebuilding of the population, NMFSdecided not to list winter-run chinook in the Sacramento River as a threatenedspecies under the ESA. Subsequent to this determination, these restorationactions were incorporated into a Ten point Winter-run Restoration Planand implemented by means of a Cooperative Agreement signed on May 20, 1988,by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), the Bureau of Reclamation(BR), the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and NMFS.The Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund (SCLDF), on behalf of the AFS, allegedthat NMFS exercised discretion not provided for in the ESA. They argued,if a population meets any of the criteria for listing, then the responsibleagency (either NMFS or FWS) has a non-discretionary duty to list that populationas a threatened or endangered species. On February 3, 1988, the SCLDF filedsuit in the Eastern District of California seeking an order to compel NMFSto list the run.Before the merits of the case were argued, information became availableto NMFS indicating that the conservation measures in place to enhance therun might not be adequate to address the adverse effects of anticipateddrought conditions. Specifically, drought conditions that arose in 1987showed signs of persisting through 1988 and water forecasts indicated thatriver temperatures might reach levels lethal to developing winter-run eggs.Further, information on remedial measures taken in 1987 was becoming availableand NMFS decided that reconsideration of its decision not to list the runwould be prudent. The SCLDF agreed to stay the suit while NMFS reviewedthis new information.On June 2, 1988, NMFS announced its intent to reconsider its decision tonot list the run and opened a public comment period to ensure that allinformation on the status of the run and factors affecting it was availablefor the reconsideration (53 FR 20155, June 2, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments Received</ITAG>A total of 27 comments were received during the comment period. Twentyfavored listing the run as a threatened species, six indicated the decisionnot to list the run should stand, and one provided information but didnot make a recommendation on whether the run should be listed. The commentsare summarized below along with brief responses.Six commentors stated that the ten-point plan (contained in the CooperativeAgreement) did not address all the threats to the winter run. The Ten-pointRestoration Plan and Cooperative Agreement address those activities thatare having the greatest adverse effect on the winter-run population. NMFSbelieves that if the actions identified in the agreement are carried out,the run will rebuild. There are activities not included in the agreementthat probably affect the run. For reasons explained in the next section(Review of the Listing Criteria) NMFS considers the risks of these otheractivities to be small compared to the activities addressed in the CooperativeAgreement. These commentors also identified several projects that, if implemented,would have adverse effects on the winter run. However, NMFS believes thatexisting legal mechanisms ensure that future projects will not be authorizedunless the needs of the winter run are addressed adequately. These mechanismsare discussed below.Six commentors stated that the ten-point plan (contained in the CooperativeAgreement) is not binding and is poorly implemented. NMFS believes thatthe signatories of the agreement have made a good faith commitment to seethat each of the actions identified in the Cooperative Agreement is completed.Some of the actions require large expenditures, consequently, these projectsare likely to proceed in phases over several years. In almost all casesthe commitments to the projects have been made and the initial phases havebeen funded. These issues are also discussed in more detail below.Three commentors stated that the ESA provides no discretion for NMFS toconsider the adequacy of Federal programs in determining whether to lista species as threatened. Section 4(b)(1)(A) gives NMFS the authority toconsider the adequacy of State and foreign conservation and protectiveprograms in determining whether to list. NMFS believes that this sectionalso applies to Federal programs, particularly because the State of Californiais so extensively involved in those Federal programs. For example, theCDFG has monitored temperatures in the upper Sacramento River, is restoringspawning gravel to the reach above Redding, and has restricted the recreationalfishery for winter run in the river. The California Department of WaterResources (DWR) is intimately linked to the BR in the management and deliveryof water for agriculture.Three commentors stated that the benefits of section 7 consultations andsection 9 prohibitions are not available to protect the winter run unlessit is listed under the ESA. Listing a specieies as threatened does notautomatically invoke the prohibitions contained in section 9. Section 7would require proposed Federal projects to be reviewed in consultationwith the NMFS to ensure the project would not jeopardize the continuedexistence of the run. However, section 7 does not apply to State projectsor actions. NMFS believes that other mandates for coordination (e.g., theNational Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Clean Water Act (CWA), FederalPower Act (FPA), Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA), and ComprehensiveEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA)) providefor the comparable opportunity for review of impacts and development ofmitigation plans for State and Federal projects.Two commentors stated that the winter run did not constitute a speciesas defined by the ESA. One of the commentors stated there is no documentationof genetic distinctness between the runs and reproductive isolation betweenthe runs is incomplete. NMFS reviewed this issue in the Notice of Determination.The term ``species'' is defined in the ESA as ``* * * any subspecies offish or wildlife or plant, and any distinct population segment of any speciesor vertebrate fish or wildlife which interbreeds when mature.'' There area number of biological definitions of a ``species'' but they share in commonthe concept of reproductive isolation and a community of gene pools (Mayr1963). Populations are defined as the community of potentially interbreedingindividuals at a given locality in time or space (Mayr 1963). Thus a biologicalspecies is composed of numerous local populations each one intercommunicatingand intergrading with the others (Mayr 1963). In defining the term ``species''in the ESA, Congress essentially equated the biological definition of ``species''with the biological definition of a ``population''. This allows the Secretariesof Commerce and Interior to use the tools provided by the ESA to protectpopulations thereby ensuring the preservation of genetic diversity withina species. Therefore, all that is needed to consider a group of animalsas a species in the context of the ESA is to demonstrate that they composea distinct population.The commentor states that the winter run does not qualify as a speciesbecause the distinctness of the population has not been demonstrated electrophoretically.Although, the CDFG has contracted a study of the genetic distinctness ofsalmonid stocks in the Sacramento River, no winter-run chinook have beenanalyzed to date. Winter-run chinook are distinguishable from the otherruns because, on average, they mature at a different rate and consequentlyare smaller, they return to the river at a different time, and they residein the river before spawning. Presumably, these traits are controlled geneticallyand if the right set of proteins were analyzed, electrophoresis would showthe run to be distinct. This presumption is supported by studies whichhave shown sequentially spawning runs in the Columbia River System to begenetically distinct (F. Utter, G. Milner, G. Stohl, and D. Teel in Press,Fishery Bulletin, Department of Commerce, NOAA, Seattle Washington).Electrophoresis is a tool for confirming the hypothesis that two or morepopulations are distinct, but it can not be used to reject such a hypothesis.Currently, only small fractions of the thousands of proteins that are derivedfrom an individuals' genome can be analyzed electrophoretically. If anelectrophoretic analysis finds no distinctness, the possibility that adistinctness exists in the untested portion of the genome can not be rejected.Therefore, even if, as the commentor suggests, winter run are not distinctelectrophoretically, we can not reject the possibility that the winterrun is genetically different from the other runs. Regardless of the ultimatefinding of the electrophoretic studies referenced by the commentor, geneticdistinctness is not a requirement for considering a population to be speciesin the context of the ESA.The commentor also asserts that the population is not reproductively isolatedand therefore does not qualify for consideration as a species. Reproductiveisolation is a criterion for determining whether a group of organisms area biological species, but is not a criterion to be used in listing speciesunder the ESA. The ESA allows the listing of populations, and populations,by definition, are not reproductively isolated (Mayr 1963). Therefore theNMFS, asserts that the winter run is a population within the species <T3>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</T3> and, therefore, can be considered a speciesin the context of the ESA.Four commentors stated that a listing of winter run would adversely affectwater use or other human activities. As four other commentors stated, theESA requires that the Secretary's listing determination be made solelyon the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available afterconducting a review of the status of the species and after taking intoaccount those efforts * * * to protect such species. Effects of a listingon human activities are not to be considered in the decision.Three commentors supported the ten-points contained in the CooperativeAgreement as adequate to provide for the restoration of the winter run.The NMFS agrees.Two commentors criticized the Ten Point Plan as being incomplete becauseit did not consider hydroelectric development, additional water marketing,bank stabilization, the Glen-Colusa Irrigation District's diversion, orgravel extraction. These problems are discussed below.A. Hydroelectric DevelopmentThe City of Redding is pursuing two hydroelectric projects_one on the SacramentoRiver at Redding and one on the Sacramento River at Red Bluff. NMFS hasbeen actively reviewing and critiquing these projects for many years. TheFederal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the licensing agency, hasindicated that they are acutely aware of the plight of the winter-run stockand are taking full account in their deliverations. NMFS has made veryspecific recommendations to modify the project to reduce or eliminate adverseimpacts and/or mitigate impacts to the other three salmon races. With regardto the winter run, the CDFG, FWS, and NMFS have indicated that no adverseimpact would be allowed. NMFS and the FWS have also indicated to FERC andthe City of Redding that they will use their authority under section 18of the Federal Power Act to prescribe fish ladders and protective juvenilefish screens that would eliminate passage impacts from winter-run fry.NMFS believes that its authorities under section 18, as well as, underthe Clean Water Act and the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, will besufficient to ensure no new threats to the winter-run population are allowedto develop as a result of hydroelectric projects on the upper SacramentoRiver.B. Additional Water MarketingThe BR has expressed its intent to market an additional 1.1 million acre-feetof water from the Central Valley Project (CVP). All of the fishery agencieshave already warned the BR that there is no water available from the TrinityRiver side of the system, because it is committed for fishery flows underthe 1980 Secretarial Decision by Secretary of the Interior Andrus. Further,because the State of California is currently undergoing a three-year reviewand modification of water rights (known as the Bay-Delta Water Rights Hearings)in the Sacramento/San Joaquin/Trinity River systems, NMFS believes thatthe marketing effort is premature and effectively moot. Although the BRis still preparing an Environmental Impact Statement on their marketingplan, the BR has stated that they could not go forward until the StateWater Resources Control Board had rendered its final water rights finding.C. Bank StabilizationThere is a generally recognized fish habitat problem with bank protectionprojects on the Sacramento River. The fishery agencies have expressed concernover these projects to the Corps of Engineers, especially those using rockriprap, which can seriously affect the survival of juvenile salmon. TheCOE and the NMFS signed a Letter of Intent on November 1, 1988 to ensurethe COE gives full deference to NMFS comments on projects proposed by theCOE to ensure that those projects do not adversely affect the winter run.Currently there are two projects being considered below the Red Bluff DiversionDam. NMFS believes major modifications will be made to these projects tomitigate or eliminate fishery impacts before they are allowed to proceed,if at all. There are no projects proposed upstream from Red Bluff, whichis considered to be the primary winter-run spawning and rearing area. NMFSdoes not believe that bank protection projects pose a major threat to winter-runchinook salmon in the Sacramento River. D. GCID DiversionsOne commentor expressed concern that the Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District(GCID) was operating with a Corps permit (Corps Section 404 Permit No.5880) that did not provide fishery protection. On the contrary, we believethat extensive changes have been made in that project and that substantialprotective conditions have been included in that Permit. The primary impact,we note occurs with the fall and perhaps late-fall run, since the GCIDagricultural pumping operations are normally relatively low (or even concluded)when winter-run juveniles migrate downstream. As part of the permit condition, the CDFG, GCID, FWS, and NMFS are investigatingalternatives to completely eliminate fish passage problems at the diversion.NMFS believes that the COE will likely receive funding to begin restorationof the river elevation in the vicinity of the diversion. This will resolvethe major part of the problem. Further, alternative analysis is underwayconcerning the solution to the fish screen problem at GCID. While NMFSdoes not believe that this is a major problem for the winter run, we believethat an extensive effort is being made to address the problem. E. Gravel ExtractionA commentor expressed concern over the impact that gravel mining operationsmay have on gravel recruitment to spawning areas of the upper SacramentoRiver. The problem appears to be greatest in Cottonwood Creek. The Corpsof Engineers has determined that the projects are outside of their jurisdiction,thus the permitting authority is at the County level. Cottonwood Creekis bounded by Shasta County and Tehama County. The fishery agencies, notablyCDFG, have expressed their concern to the County planning agencies. ShastaCounty has passed a restrictive ripararian habitat and gravel mining ordinancethat forbids new mining in Cottonwood Creek, but Tehama County is continuingto permit mining on its side of the Creek. NMFS and the CDFG intend tocontinue to press their case to Tehama County and specifically alert themas to the crucial role that gravel recruitment plays with the winter run.Nevertheless, because it is local agency, it is not likely that a Section7 consultation, pursuant to an ESA listing, would be able to provide anyadditional protection. For completeness of the record and to answer other criticisms of the TenPoint Plan, the following is a brief update of the status of each of thepoints in the Ten Point Plan. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Raise RBDD Gates from December 1 to April 1 </ITAG>The purpose of raising the gates at RBDD from December 1 to April 1 isto reduce the blockage of returning adult winter run and the loss of outmigratingjuvenile salmon during the period. One commentor expressed concern that,although use of this technique during the past two seasons made a positivecontribution, the BR's commitment was not binding and the early loweringof the gates in February 1988 is an example of the BR's stronger commitmentto irrigation. NMFS believes that, although the commitment is not binding, the BR is committedto maximizing passage of winter-run chinook past the RBDD. The CooperativeAgreement, signed May 20, 1988, contains a mechanism for consultation andcoordination between the NMFS and BR before decisions are made to lowerto RBDD gates early. The Cooperative Agreement also extends the BR's commitmentto raising the gates during the winter for four years. See section on ListingCriteria below for further discussion.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Develop Winter-Run Chinook Salmon Propagation Program at ColemanNational Fish Hatchery (NFH)</ITAG>Artificial propagation at Coleman NFH is to be used as a means to provideprotection from the catastrophic effects of droughts or an El NinandCx.174;6oevent as well a means to speed the rate of recovery of the winter-run salmon.One commentor expressed concerns that Coleman NFH had neither the fundingnor a comprehensive hatchery propagation plan.The FWS is developing a hatchery culture program that would ultimatelycontribute twenty thousand adult winter-run chinook salmon. When fullyimplemented, the FWS' winter-run culture program will have the followingcapabilities: capture adult fish and transport to holding facilities, holdsufficient adult winter-run chinook salmon so that 1,800 adults surviveto spawning, take and incubate up to 1.89 million eggs, and rear sufficientjuvenile for release of 1.5 million smolts. Mortality of adult fish being held for spawning has been a problem, withhigh temperature and disease being important sources of mortality. TheFWS is currently constructing facilities for holding and spawning winter-runadults. This facility includes deep dark holding ponds, an insulated spawningbuilding, water chillers, and adequate supply of CVP power to run the chillers.Construction will be complete in December of 1988_in time to take eggsfrom the next year's winter-run chinook spawning run. The FWS is presentlydeveloping the required Environmental Analysis for the complete Winter-runPropagation Program; the document should be released this winter.Until the FWS secures full funding to implement the Coleman Station DevelopmentPlan, the FWS' short term plan is to spawn 900 adults, take about 925,000eggs and rear for release about 500,000 smolts annually. The FWS will beginto trap and spawn adults and rear juvenile winter run during 1989.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Restore Spawning Habitat in the Redding Area</ITAG>Severe degradation of much of the present winter-run salmon spwaning areadownstream from Keswick Dam has been caused by loss of gravel recruitmentfrom above Keswick Dam. Spawning riffle restoration is needed in orderto increase natural reproduction to desirable levels. Until last year,plans for gravel restoration of this area were fairly general and one ofthe commentors was concerned that no active restoration was underway.Active restoration is underway. The BR and CDFG are cooperating to improvesalmon spawning habitat between the Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Districtand Keswick dams. The BR has provided $250,000 to contract to CDFG forplacement of approximately 16,000 cubic yards of spawning grave (sortedone to four inch diameter) into the river. This spawning gravel restorationproject will be completed prior to the 1989 winter-run spawning season.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Develop Measures to Control Squawfish at RBDD</ITAG>Sacramento River squawfish are a major predator on juvenile fall-run salmonin the upper Sacramento River. Data are lacking relative to the effectof squawfish predation on juvenile winter-run salmon which pass RBDD inthe fall, but is assumed to be a factor. One commentor stated that therehad been no real progress in squawfish control at RBDD.NMFS has conducted a survey to determine the feasibility of commercialharvest and marketing of squawfish as a means of controlling the squawfishpopulation. Indications were that a small fishery was feasible and thata viable commercial market was available. NMFS awarded a Saltonstall-KennedyGrant to an individual in the Red Bluff area to develop such a small fishery.During one of the regularly scheduled Winter-run Restoration Team meetings,the team discussed the concerns of some members that squawfish and alsoa native species and squawfish reduction measures should not be implementedbefore a specific predation problem was documented. As a result, NMFS hasentered into a contract with the FWS to conduct an initial survey to documentthe presence or extent of the squawfish predation problem. This work isscheduled to be completed in March 1989.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Restrict In-River Fishery</ITAG>NMFS concluded, in its initial consideration of the Petition to List, thatocean commercial and recreational harvests did not contribute to the declineof the winter-run stock and that eliminating these fisheries would notsubstantially aid in winter-run restoration.Nevertheless, the California Fish and Game Commission instituted a limitedannual quota of 175 winter-run chinook to be taken in the Sacramento Riverrecreational fishery. In 1987, the first year of the annual quote, only37 winter run were caught; in 1988, 90 were taken.NMFS has acknowledged that salmon tagging data documenting the impactsof harvest on winter-run stocks were limited. NMFS has funded the CDFGto implant coded wire tags in the juvenile winter run that are producedby the FWS' hatchery program to collect information on migration patternsof winter-run salmon in the ocean and the Bay-Delta. This information shouldhelp NMFS decide whether additional management of the recreational fisheryis warranted.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Develop Water Temperature Control for Warm Water Years</ITAG>Existing water demands have resulted in releases from the Shasta-KeswickDam complex of high temperature water during the summer and fall spawningperiods for salmon which have caused serious morality, especially to thewinter and spring runs. The releases of warm water during the summer andfall occur primarily during years of low precipitation and when storagein Shasta Reservoir is low. As more and more water is being exported fromthe system, these warm temperature conditions are occurring more frequentlythan in the past. Although substantial progress has occurred, one commentorwas concerned that only incomplete and temporary solutions are being considered.The California Water Quality Control Plan for Sacramento River, adoptedby the California Regional Water Quality Control Board (Regional Board)in 1975, contains specific temperature objectives for anadromous fish inthe upper Sacramento River. The Regional Board, reacting to concerns theShasta Unit of the CVP was exceeding these objectives, set enforceablewaste discharge temperature standards for the Shasta/Trinity Division ofthe CVP in March, 1988 (Order No. 88-043). These standards call for maintaining56anddegrees;F downstream from Keswick to RBDD.Reacting to fishery agency concerns about temperature impacts and to therecent Regional Board temperature standards, the BR conducted a Value EngineeringStudy in September 1987 to investigate and develop alternative methodsof controlling the temperature of Shasta releases. After evaluating a widevariety of structural alternatives, including multi-level dam outlets,and operational alternatives, the study concluded that a design, knownas a Temperature Control Curtain would be the most effective solution.The Temperature Curtain will be designed and constructed as the BR's permanentengineered solution to the problem. The BR has committed to having thestructure in place in time for the 1990 winter run. On August 11, 1988,President Reagan signed a Drought Relief Bill which included $5.5 millionfor construction of the temperature control curtain.In addition, the BR implemented interim operational measures in 1987 and1988 to control upper river temperatures utilizing cool, low-level releasesfrom Shasta Reservoir. See the Listing Criteria section for further discussion.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Correct Spring Creek Pollution Problem</ITAG>Acid mine wastes, containing toxic concentrations of heavy metals, arereleased from the abandoned Iron Mountain Mines site on Spring Creek, atributary to the upper Sacramento River. These wastes are stored by theBR in the Spring Creek Debris Dam Reservoir, where they are released tothe river when sufficient dilution flows occur. BR evaluated the problemand submitted its report to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).EPA placed the site on its Superfund Priority List; they have completeda Remedial Investigation/Fleasibility Study of the problem. EPA has identifieda combination of source control, treatment, and water management as themost cost effective remedial solution. One commentor believed that therewas no evidence of a commitment by EPA to successfully correct the IronMountain Mine pollution problem.The EPA and the BR have drafted an Agreement to implement actions to resolvethe Spring Creek toxicity. Under this Agreement the EPA will fund activitiesthrough its Superfund Program and will be the managing agency. The BR willbe responsible for design and construction of the water management componentsthat protect most of the Spring Creek Basin drainage from being contaminatedand will reduce the possibility of a spill from Spring Creek Reservoir.Implementation of this Plan is estimated to cost about $70 million. Afterextensive legal battles, EPA has gained access to the mine property andthey recently conducted on-site testing of materials. They have spent $2million this year to cap exposed tailings piles and have scheduled $1 millionto conduct mine rehabilitation next fiscal year. The full EPA Superfundprogram is underway and on schedule.In addition, the Regional Board, CDFG, and the BR have undertaken an emergencyaction program this summer/fall to treat concentrated mine effluent anddisposed of the toxic sludge. The purpose of this emergency action is toavoid or minimize impacts that may occur this year, due to the droughtand the problem of obtaining dilution flows.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Correct Problem at the Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation DistrictDam (ACID)</ITAG>There are two fishery problems associated with the ACID dam, 1) river flowreductions necessary to install and remove ACID dam flashboards, and 2)fish passage with the existing fish ladder is often ineffictive when thedam is in place. Although problems persist, we believe that CDFG and BRhave made progress in addressing the problem and that the degree of theimpact has been reduced. NMFS has recommended that, as an interim solutionto the problem, the BR and ACID should amend their Contract to meet CDFG'sspecifications to limit the rate of low change allowed and forbid reductionbelow 6,000 cfs. See Listing Criteria for further discussion.<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Correct Stilling Basin Problem at Keswick Dam</ITAG>Adult winter-run chinook have become entrapped in Keswick Dam stillingbasin following spills. In the past, the BR, FWS, and CDFG would cooperateto release fish that were caught in the stilling basin. However, aftercooperatively evaluating alternatives with the fishery agencies, the BRrecently made permanent modifications to the existing ladder facility.We believe that this is no longer a problem affecting winter-run chinook<ITAG tagnum="81">10. Continue to Expand Studies on Winter-Run Chinook Salmon</ITAG>One commentor expressed concern that only limited or token progress hasbeen made towards gathering the additional winter-run data needed to developa comprehensive restoration program. NMFS acknowledges that, over the pasttwo years, priority has been given to physically reducing known adverseimpacts which required immediate attention. However, NMFS, along with itssister fishery agencies, have developed a program of research studies thatwe believe are needed for complete restoration and effective management.This plan of research was presented to the Winter-run Chinook Salmon RestorationTeam and the fishery agencies are beginning to program these studies intotheir budgets. Some studies have already commenced_for example: NMFS hasfunded an ongoing CDFG study to evaluate the pattern of migration and theextent of recreational and commercial harvest; conducted a survey to determinethe feasibility of commercial harvest and marketing of squawfish and hasfunded a FWS survey to document the presence or extent of the squawfishpredation problem, in addition to funding helicopter surveys of the winter-runspawning run to refine our knowledge about the distribution of spawningredds in the river and timing of spawning. The FWS and CDFG have conducteddiving surveys to determine the locations of preferred spawning and rearingareas in the upper Sacramento River.<ITAG tagnum="84">Current Winter-Run Status</ITAG>The 1988 Sacramento winter-run spawning run was about the same size asin recent years. Based on counts at the Red Bluff Diversion Dam (RBDD)fish ladders, approximately 2,085 fish reached the winter-run spawninggrounds above the RBDD. Only 90 in-river sport caught fish were taken outof a quota of 175 in 1988. During the course of counting and sampling the winter-run chinook passingRBDD in 1988, it was determined that 36 percent of the run consisted ofsexually precocious two-year old males (known as jacks); winter run normallymature sexually at three years of age. The winter run has historically(since 1967) averaged about 25 percent jacks. In some salmonid populationsscientists have documented a proportional relationship between the numberof jacks and the number of three-year olds returning the following year.Although no specific data exist for the winter run, such an assumptioncould lead one to expect a somewhat larger return of spawning 3-year-oldsin 1989. The latest estimates of winter-run chinook salmon migrating upstreampast RBDD, based on data developed by CDFG is:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,10</C> <H1>Year</H1><H1>Number</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1967<D>57,306</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1968<D>84,414</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1969<D>117,808</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1970<D>40,409</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1971<D>53,089</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1972<D>37,133</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1973<D>24,079</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1974<D>21,897</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1975<D>23,430</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1976<D>35,096</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1977<D>17,214</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1978<D>24,862</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1979<D>2,364</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1980<D>1,156</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1981<D>20,041</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1982<D>1,242</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1983<D>1,831</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1984<D>2,663</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1985<D>3,962</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1986<D>2,422</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1987<D>2,236</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1988<D>2,085</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Review of the Listing Criteria</ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the ESA specifies five criteria to be evaluated in reviewingthe status of a species or population proposed for listing.

The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailmentof its Habitat or Range</ITAG>This is the listing factor associated with the most adverse impacts tothe winter run. The major elements that have contributed to the degradationof winter-run habitat are features of the Federal Central Valley Project.The RBDD blocks or impedes passage of winter-run chinook to suitable spawninghabitat, essentially all of which is above the RBDD. Operation of the Shasta/Keswickdams contributes to adverse water temperatures in the reach of the SacramentoRiver that otherwise contains suitable spawning habitat. This is particularlya problem during drought years. Several other activities are ongoing thathave lesser impacts on the winter run. <T3>Red Bluff Diversion Dam. </T3>At the recommendation of the fisheryresource agencies, the BR agreed to an experiemental period during whichthe gates at RBDD would be raised (opened) between December 1 and April1, with the caveat that the gates may have to be lowered (closed) to deliverwater for irrigation or maintenance of canals. The period of migrationof the four runs past RBDD has been characterized by averaging the cumulativenumber of fish that passed RBDD during the years 1971 through 1982. Basedon these data, raising the gates through April 1 should allow about 66%of the winter run free access to its spawning habitat. From December 1 to April 1, 1986-87, the gates were raised for a periodof 94 days. The FWS conducted a study of fish passage during the periodthe gates were opened. The results of that study showed that 11 radio taggedsalmon were delayed an average of 3.19 hours or 28 times less than whenthe gates were down. Also none of the tagged salmon that approached thedam, while the gates were raised, backed downstream away for the dam. Previousstudies showed over half of the salmon tagged backed downstream after encounteringthe dam. Further, data from an earlier year (1985) (with the RBDD gates closed inthe winter) showed about 30 percent of the winter-run spawning took placedownstream from RBDD, where temperatures were considered to be lethal forincubating eggs. During the 1986-87 winter, approximately 95 percent spawnedabove RBDD, indicating the relative effectiveness of raising the RBDD gatesin improving winter-run passage. During the winter of 1987-88, the gates were raised for a period of 77days. Gates were lowered early in 1988 because of water demands servicedby the Tehama-Colusa Canal. The Cooperative Agreement (at Section II.A.8)signed May 20, 1988, minimizes this problem, because it establishes mechanismsfor consultation and coordination between the BR and NMFS before decisisonto lower the gates early are made. This will ensure other options for meetingirrigation demands are considered prior to lowering the gates at RBDD.The Cooperative Agreement also extends the period of experimentation forfour additional years. This will allow adequate time to evaluate otherfish passage alternatives that might be available. The FWS completed its study on fish passage problems in September 1988.The BR is evaluating the FWS report and plans to propose recommendationsfor solving the fish passage problem by September 1989. The Central ValleyTask Force (CVTF) provides a forum for discussing and selecting alternativesolutions to protest the winter run. NMFS has appointed a Winter-Run ChinookSalmon Restoration Team, comprising agency and independent biologists mostfamiliar with the winter run, to provide expert advice on the restorationactions. NMFS intends to use these forums as well as the Cooperative Agreementto ensure the success of winter-run passage at the RBDD. NMFS believesthese mechanisms provide ample opportunity for consultation and protectionof the winter run. The recent record of operation of RBDD by the BR andthe mechanisms for coordination with the NMFS on changes in future operationsensures that the operation of RBDD by the BR will substantially reducethe impact on the winter-run migration. The Tehama-Colusa Canal (TCC), which diverts Sacramento River water atRBDD, is protected by an inefficient fish screening facility. Consequently,outmigrating juvenile salmon and fry are entrained and lost. Although theeffect of this mortality on the winter-run population has not been specificallyquantified, studies by the FWS indicate that an estimated 3.9 percent ofthe outmigrating juvenile winter run are lost at these screens. As partof the BR's efforts to improve operation of the RBDD and the TCC, and tomitigate impacts to fish populations, the BR plans to construct a new fishscreen and bypass system at the Tehama-Colusa canal. These new facilitieswill afford anadromous fish the maximum protection from entrainment atthe TCC. The design and placement of the new fish screens was developedin consultation with the NMFS, FWS, and the CDFG. These screens are a state-of-the-artdesign and should minimize the effect of entrainment on winter run. Theconstruction schedule is designed to ``phase in'' the new screens so thatthere will be fish protection at all times. Work on the new screens beganin August 1988 and will be complete in fall 1990.<T3>Shasta/Keswick Dams.</T3> Equally as important as the problems at RBDDare temperature problems in the upper Sacramento River. During the summermonths, when winter-run eggs and fry are developing, water temperaturesbelow RBDD exceed lethal temperatures in most years (Hallock and Fisher1985, CDFG, Anadromous Fish Branch Office Report 28 pp.). During droughtconditions lethal temperatures have occurred above Red Bluff as well. Rivertemperatures of 56 anddegrees;F are safe for spawning and incubation; 57.5anddegrees;F is considered to be the lower threshold for temperature inducedmortality; and 62 anddegrees;F is believed to produce 100 percent mortality.The design of the Shasta Dam spill gates and intake to the powerhouse penstockscontributes to this problem. The present intake design does not providea mechanism for releasing cold, deep water during the summer without reducinghydropower generation. Therefore, warm surface water is withdrawn for powergeneration and released into the river where it adversely affects spawninghabitat.In May 1987, the fishery agencies expressed to BR their concern over predictedlethal temperatures above RBDD and estimates of substantial mortality ofthe 1987 winter-run year class. The BR responded with a water managementstrategy to lower river temperatures that included opening, for the firsttime since the Dam was constructed, a low-level outlet in Shasta Dam thatdraws deep, cold water. This low-level release contributed to maintainingan average river temperature of 57.5 anddegrees;F over the period August26, 1987 to September 10, 1987. NMFS believes that action should have salvagedalmost all of the winter-run spawn. Complete assessment of the actual benefitsof this and other actions taken to protect the 1987 winter run must waituntil 1990, when the benefited year class will return from sea as sexuallymature spawning adults; an assessment of the impact of the elevated temperaturescannot be made until then.In March of 1988, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board issuedOrder No. 88-043, imposing waste discharge requirements (including temperature)on the BR's Shasta/Trinity River Division operation. The Order prescribesmaintenance of Sacramento River temperatures upstream from the Red BluffDiversion Dam at not more than 56 anddegrees;F to protect fishery resources.This is the first time that specific, enforceable temperature standardshave been imposed. The Order cited evidence that future BR Central ValleyProject operations would cause water temperatures of Shasta Dam dischargesto increase and ``* * * typically exceed 56 anddegrees;F'' during the periodof winter-run spawning and rearing. The BR opposed the order and is currentlyappealing the decision on jurisdictional grounds; they, instead, urgedthe use of non-binding, voluntary agreements to achieve similar ends.With the drought conditions persisting into 1988, the BR, at the April21, 1988 meeting of the CVTF, reported that unaltered operation of theShasta/Trinity Division could produce temperatures at Keswick Dam of approximately53 anddegrees;F in July, 63 anddegrees;F in August, 61 anddegrees;F in Septemberand 57 anddegrees;F in October. The CVTF appointed an interagency task group(comprising CDFG, FWS, NMFS, BR, Western Area Power Administration, RegionalWater Resources Control Board, California Department of Water Resources,and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) to develop a water management strategythat would maintain optimal temperatures in the river for incubation andsurvival of winter-run eggs and fry. The task group presented six alternativesto the CVTF with a consensus recommendation for an alternative that, withinthe physical capabilities of the BR, maximized winter-run survival by ensuringthe continuous availability of cold water through the spawning and incubationperiods. The CVTF approved the recommended alternative at its July 15,1988 meeting and the BR is committed to operating according to this plan.The BR commenced cool water Shasta releases ten days ahead of its plannedschedule, because monitoring programs showed river temperatures were risingfaster than predicted. Further, they assured the fishery agencies thatthe BR would continue to alter its operations, where possible, to maintainsafe river temperatures in areas where winter-run eggs and larvae wererearing. In fact, the BR fulfilled its commitment and maintained modifiedoperations and suitable river temperatures through the end of Septemberwhen all winter run were emerged from the gravel and dispersed to rearinghabitat.The use of low-level, cool water releases to protect the winter run wasnot without cost. Because such releases are below the powerhouse intakelevel, the BR must forego hydroelectric power generation. The task groupestimated 1987 winter-run operations entailed a foregone power cost of$870,000; in 1988, temperature controls resulted in a foregone power costnearly double (about $4.3 million) the $1.75 to $2.45 million estimatedby the CVTF task group, because low level releases had to be initiatedearlier than had been anticipated. While such economic considerations cannotenter into the NMFS' listing evaluation, they do indicate the extent ofthe BR's commitment to employing cooperative programs for protecting thewinter run during the critical months of the summer.Finally, the BR has committed to constructing a permanent temperature controldevice at Shasta Dam that will allow cold bottom water to be drawn intothe power penstocks so the river temperatures can be controlled withoutforegoing power production. Funding for the curtain is secure and designof the device has begun. Installation is expected by June of 1990.At the October 14, 1988 meeting of the Winter-Run Restoration Team, theteam expressed a consensus opinion that the BR's implementation of theCVTF task group's efforts addressed the threat presented by 1988 droughtconditions in the Sacramento Basin and saved the run from a major naturalenvironmental insult. NMFS believes these mitigating actions approximateand probably exceed what could have been accomplished pursuant to a formalconsultation conducted under Section 7 of the ESA<ITAG tagnum="81">Anderson Cottonwood Irrigation District Diversion Dam</ITAG>The Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation District (ACID) Diversion Dam presentstwo problems to salmonids in the upper Sacramento River. It impedes upstreammigration when the dam is operational and it contributes to flow modificationsthat can cause dewatered spawning nests (redds). While these problems contributeto the winter run's condition, the NMFS points out that these problemsexisted annually from 1946 when Shasta Dam was built. Whereas winter-runpopulation estimates are not readily available for the years precedingthe construction of the RBDD, counts at RBDD in late 1960s indicate therun was large despite problems created by the ACID Diversion Dam. Nevertheless, measures are in place that address these problems. The ACIDis prohibited, for safety reasons, from installing the flashboards betweenDecember 1 and March 15. Much like the fish passage experiment at the RBDD,this restriction allows about 50 percent of the winter run to migrate upstreamof the ACID Dam unimpeded. Unlike the RBDD though, there is suitable spawninghabitat below the ACID Dam. In addition, there is some preliminary indicationthat the ACID Dam has a beneficial impact because of its tendency to retainspawning gravel in the prime spawning area immediately upstream from ACID.The problem of stranded redds (discussed in the Notice of Determination(52 FR 6041)) is caused largely by the need to change the configurationof the ACID Dam to accommodate high flow releases from Keswick Dam. In1987, ACID was able to modify their operational criteria to minimize theperiod when ACID Dam modification would be required. These improved operatingprocedures are likely to persist while the CDFG, BR, and ACID researchmethods to eliminate the problem entirely. The NMFS believes that theseongoing efforts substantially reduce any short-term threats to the winterrun created by the operation of the ACID Dam. <T3>Hydroelectric Projects.</T3> The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission(FERC) is considering licensing applications for two hydroelectric projectswhich, if authorized, would adversely affect the winter run. These arethe Lake Redding Project and the Lake Red Bluff Project, which was recentlyreactivated by the FERC. If built, these projects would result in significantloss of winter-run habitat and aggravated fish passage problems. However,Section 18 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791<T3> et seq.</T3>) grants the NMFS authority to prescribe standards forfish passage. These standards must be met before the projects can be authorized.Consequently, the NMFS believes that its authority under section 18 issufficient to ensure no new threats to the winter-run population will beallowed to develop as a result of hydroelectric projects on the upper SacramentoRiver. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific or EducationalPurposes</ITAG>Use of the winter run by commercial and recreational fishermen has notchanged since the original determination to not list the population asthreatened. The best information available indicates that the catch inthe ocean troll fishery and the ocean recreational fishery is not substantial.The recreational fishery in the Sacramento River is limited by the CaliforniaFish and Game Commission to less than 175 fish per year. The actual catchesin 1987 and 1988 were well below that limit. As stated in the originalNotice of Determination, NMFS had concluded that harvests have not beeninstrumental in the decline of the winter run and that elimination of harvestswould not significantly aid the restoration of the run. Point 10 of the Ten-Point Restoration Plan called for more informationto be gathered on the winter run. The NMFS, FWS, and CDFG have proposedresearch projects which would provide key information on this run. Oneof the research projects that the agencies are currently attempting tofund would update and refine the estimates of sport and commercial harvest.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Disease or Predation</ITAG>Squawfish was identified in the status review as the piscine predator withthe greatest potential for interfering with the rebuilding of the winter-runpopulation. In 1987, NMFS assisted in an experimental fishing operationand test marketing of squawfish which demonstrated that a commercial fisheryfor squawfish is feasible. NMFS has contracted with FWS to document theextent of the influence of squawfish predation on the winter-run population.Another study will follow to determine the impact of various harvest levelson the squawfish population. NMFS will fund further development of a demonstrationcommercial squawfish fishery through a Saltonstall-Kennedy grant during1988-89. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms</ITAG>Relevant laws that comprise the existing regulatory mechanisms were listedin the Notice of Determination (52 FR 6041) and described as providingadequate mechanisms for restoring the winter run in the Sacramento River.However, the decline in the size of the run since the late 1960s indicatesthat these regulatory mechanisms were not applied effectively with respectto the winter run. NMFS now believes that with the Cooperative Agreementamong the NMFS, BR, FWS, and CDFG and the Letter of Intent between NMFSand the COE in place, these mechanisms will be used and are adequate toprovide for the restoration of the run. The signatory agencies have alsocommitted to better coordinating the use of their individual authoritiesto foster the restoration of the run. This improved coordination is expectedto increase the effectiveness of the regulatory mechanisms. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting the Continued Existenceof the Species</ITAG>The impact of manmade factors is addressed under criterion 1. Natural factorsof greatest concern are periodic droughts and the oceanographic phenomenonknown as El NinandCx.174;6o. The 1976-77 drought severely reduced the sizeof two consecutive cohorts leaving the 1978 brood as the only large spawningcohort. The strong El NinandCx.174;6o event during 1982-83 contributed tothe decline of the last strong cohort. The only measure to mitigate theprofound impact of a strong El NinandCx.174;6o is hatchery rearing to increasesmolt production from the returning spawners that survive the poor oceanconditions. Drought conditions, such as those that existed during the past two dryyears in Northern California, most directly threaten the winter run bycausing elevated water temperatures on the spawning grounds. This problemwas resolved using interim measures in 1987 and 1988. If drought conditionspersist into 1989 a similar drought response strategy will be developedand implemented. Beginning in 1990, the installation of a temperature controlcurtain will provide a longer-term solution. In addition, the FWS is preparingto raise winter run at the Coleman National Fish Hatchery. If the techniquesfor holding and spawning winter run in the hatchery can be perfected, thatprogram will provide an extra measure of protection against drought andhigh water temperatures. NMFS believes that these actions will mitigatethe losses to the winter-run population due to periodic drought. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusions</ITAG>For the reasons presented in the discussion above, NMFS concludes the following:1. The status of the winter-run population has not deteriorated since theoriginal determination by NMFS not to list the run as threatened. 2. The comments received during the reconsideration period did not providesubstantial new information that would persuade NMFS to list this species.3. There have been substantial commitments by State and Federal agenciesto implement the Ten Point Restoration Plan and several actions identifiedin that Plan are underway.NMFS reaffirms its determination (under sections 4 (a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)of the ESA) that the actions of State and Federal agencies to restore thewinter run of chinook salmon population and its habitat adequately addressthe threats to the population and that the population is not likely tobecome endangered throughout all or a significant portion of its rangein the foreseeable future (i.e. the winter run is not a threatened species).Therefore, listing is not appropriate under the current conditions. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: December 6, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
