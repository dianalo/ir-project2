The advice from most financial experts after all the hoopla diesdown is simple: take things real slow.   ``Preserving your capital is the first thing you've got to do.You'll have plenty of time to invest it,'' David McLaughlin, afinancial adviser with Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottseville,Va., said Monday. ``You must make sure your money is safe andearning something.''   Such is the ``problem'' for at least half a dozen FloridaLottery players. Six tickets matched the winning numbers drawn onSaturday in the Florida Lottery estimated at $106.5 million - astate record and the second largest in U.S. history behindPennsylvania's $115 million jackpot last year. Each Florida ticketis worth about $17.75 million over 20 years, or $887,500 annuallybefore taxes.   Many investment counselors suggest that for the first couple ofyears lottery winners - or anyone with a sudden windfall, for thatmatter - keep a portion of their loot in liquid assets, such ascertificates of deposit or Treasury bills, until they can figureout what they want to do with it.   Some banks, such as Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, even offerspecial accounts for clients who suddenly have $1 million or moreand need a place to park it.   The rest can go into longer-term bonds, including tax-freemunicipal issues, or growth stocks, experts say.   For McLaughlin, the mix would be divided equally among Treasurybills, Treasury notes or bonds, and stocks for the first few years.Of course, a very small portion may be splurged, he said.   Charles Clough, the chief investment strategist for MerrillLynch andamp; Co., would recommend that 45 percent of the winnings gointo intermediate- and long-term bonds, 10- to 15 percent in cashor 90-day T-bills, and 40- to 45 percent in stocks.   ``But stay away from stocks (of companies) that depend oncyclical consumer spending,'' he warned.   State lottery officials often don't provide financial advice towinners, except to sometimes explain tax liabilities and urgewinners to hire a good accountant. Those who fail to take suchadvice run the risk of falling prey to peddlers of bogusinvestments.   But among the biggest problems most lottery recipients will faceis having to sift through all the solicitations from variousfinancial brokers.   ``They're going to be getting a lot of calls,'' said McLaughlin,who recommends winners get an unlisted telephone number forstarters.   ``There will be a lot of pressure,'' added Michael Naste, anindependent financial planner from Deland, Fla., and a $2.5 millionlottery winner himself. ``If they're not careful, they can easilyoverextend themselves.''   Such was the case of a young New York beautician who won $7million about five years ago, said Naste, who says he has 73lottery winners as clients.   Before the young woman came to him for help, he said, she hadmade several poor investments like putting her money into stripshopping centers.   ``She's half a million (dollars) in debt right now . . . andshe'll barely come out ahead,'' even after receiving all herlottery payments, Naste said. ``She had quit her job and now she'sgone back to work.''   A middle-aged construction worker who won $4 million in the NewYork lottery four years ago also ran into probolems, said Naste.   After receiving a check for around $148,000 - the first of his20 annual after-tax installments - he quit his $38,000-a-year job,threw a party and put $10,000 down on each of 10 new Cadillacs, hesaid.   But in the next eight months, six of the luxury cars wererepossessed and the man had to borrow $200,000 to hold him overbetween lottery checks, Naste said.   Most big-lottery winners, though, are fairly conservative,financial advisers and state lottery officials say.   Michigan, for example, found in a 1987 survey that nearly threequarters of its $1 million-plus lottery winners had sought expertfinancial advice.   The majority used their first check to pay bills or splurge on anew home or car, but later, most made long-term investments, savedfor retirement, or established trust funds, the survey showed.</TEXT></DOC>
