Vic Haynes the morning after the welcomerally for seven recently freed ANC leaders in a soccer stadiumoutside Johannesburg.   Nearly everything about the gathering violated security laws,but police kept their distance and state television led the eveningnews with a report on what was the largest anti-government rally inSouth Africa's 79-year history.   Newspapers, including pro-government media, today called on thegovernment to do away with laws restricting political activity. Andthe goverment hinted it may be considering lifting somerestrictions on political expression to allow peaceful protests.   ``We must be prepared to run risks,'' Law and Order MinisterAdriaan Vlok said on government-run television Sunday night, addingthat maintaining the status quo is riskier than allowing massprotests.   But Andries Treurnicht, head of the pro-apartheid ConservativeParty, called for Parliament to meet immediately to discuss thedirection the government was taking.   ``The ANC, under its own flag and that of the Communist Partyalongside, is enjoying complete freedom to propagate its aims andambitions and issues one ultimatum after the other to thegovernment,'' Treurnicht said.   ``So-called peace protests are escalating and are accepted bythe government as legal utterances of grievances,'' he said.   The government granted permission for Sunday's rally as part ofan attempt by new President F.W. de Klerk to promote black-whitenegotiations. But a magistrate had warned organizers that speakersshould avoid promoting ANC aims.   ``We refused,'' said Cyril Ramaphosa, a union leader and one ofthe main rally organizers. ``The ANC lives. It is amongst us.''   ``Today, the ANC has captured center stage in South Africa,''declared Walter Sisulu, 77, the group's former general secretary,in the main address Sunday to the cheering, singing, dancing throngwhich filled most of the seats in the recently opened stadium.   Police and soldiers set up roadblocks nearby and searchedvehicles, but few security force personnel were visible at thestadium itself.   From a podium erected beneath huge banners of the ANC and theSouth African Communist Party, Sisulu appeared with six ANCcolleagues freed unconditionally from prison Oct. 15. All but onehad spent at least 25 years in prison.   Deafening cheers arose when Sisulu and his colleagues slowlycircled the playing field, each walking under an umbrella, behindan honor guard of 20 young militants, clad in khaki uniforms andmarching in military style.   ``ANC, ANC,'' shouted the crowd, many dressed in the movement'sgreen, black and gold colors, or wearing T-shirts with the slogan,``ANC Lives'' and the names of the freed prisoners.   The crowd included white South Africans and diplomats from atleast 15 countries.   Sisulu said his movement would never abandon its guerrillacampaign unilaterally. But, repeating previous offers, he said itwould consider suspending violence and entering talks if thegovernment frees all political prisoners, legalizes the ANC andlifts the 40-month-old state of emergency.   ``To date, we see no clear indication that the government isserious about negotiation,'' said Sisulu, who urged intensifiedeconomic sanctions. ``All the utterances are vague.''   The crowed roared when prominent activist Murphy Morobe read aletter of greeting from Oliver Tambo, the exiled president of theANC, who may not legally be quoted in South Africa.   ``This is a joyful day for all of us,'' said the message. ``Wemeet to celebrate a victory that belongs to all the people of ourcountry.''   Tambo directed part of his remarks at South African whites whoseek to maintain apartheid, which denies the nation's 28 millionblacks a voice in national affairs. The 5 million whites controlthe economy and maintain separate schools, districts and healthservices.   ``They are part of our heritage,'' Tambo's message said. ``Inthe end, they too must learn to celebrate freedom and notoppression.''   If the government tries to perpetuate minority rule, said Tambo,blacks will win their stuggle through confrontation.   In addition to the seven ANC leaders freed Oct. 15, the rallyalso honored Govan Mbeki, released from prison in November 1987.Sisulu, Mbeki and four of the other men were sentenced to lifeimprisonment at a 1964 treason trial along with Nelson Mandela, theANC's best-known leader, who remains jailed.   Mandela's wife, Winnie, who earlier this year was at odds withprominent anti-apartheid leaders, was introduced over the publicaddress system and had a seat of honor on the podium.   State television showed footage of the crowd and paraphrasedsome of Sisulu's remarks but did not broadcast any excerpts of thespeeches.   The rally went ahead despite anonymous threats that whiteextremists would shoot at black spectators. There were no seriousdisturbances.   Scores of buses brought blacks from communities across thecountry.   The ANC has been outlawed since 1960, a year before it began asabotage and bombing campaign. It was founded in 1912 and spent itsfirst five decades using non-violent tactics to seek rights forblacks.   De Klerk, who assumed power in mid-August, has offered tonegotiate a new constitution within five years that would extendpolitical rights to blacks but protect white interests.   The ANC wants a constitution that would establish a one-person,one-vote system.</TEXT></DOC>
