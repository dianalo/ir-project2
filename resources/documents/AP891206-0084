REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The strain of a six-day coup attemptshowed upon the face of Corazon Aquino as she appealed Wednesdayfor her people to stand behind her in the gravest crisis faced byher 3{-year administration.   Mrs. Aquino made the appeal in her first nationally televisedappearance since Sunday, when she told military mutineers to``surrender or die.''   But on Wednesday, it was a different ``Cory'' Aquino. Gone wasthe steely, uncompromising firmness that marked not only the Sundayspeech but other addresses she has delivered during five previouscoup attempts.   This time, her eyes were swollen and her face was drawn. Shestared plaintively into the camera like a woman who had beenbetrayed.   ``I did not think of being president,'' Mrs. Aquino said. ``Ijust wanted to serve you. I just wanted to restore democracy. Iwant to respect your rights. I am only asking you to help me.''   In previous crises, Mrs. Aquino delivered speeches in the crispmonotone of a teacher lecturing an errant pupil. She prefers tomake speeches in English, an official language in the Philippines.   On Wednesday, however, she spoke in Tagalog, a native languagebetter understood by ordinary Filipinos. Her choice of words andthe manner of speaking exuded more desperation than confidence.   ``I am telling you now that I have put so much at stake fordemocracy,'' she said, raising her arms slightly. ``I lost myhusband. ... Many of us suffered and until now we have put ourlives at stake.''   Mrs. Aquino's husband, Benigno Aquino Jr., was slain in 1983 ashe stepped from a jet after arriving in Manila from the UnitedStates to challenge the late President Ferdinand Marcos forleadership of the country.   Ordinarily, Mrs. Aquino reads speeches carefully crafted by herstaff. This time, she appeared to.be speaking extemporaneuosly, andfrom the heart.   ``Why did I become president?'' Mrs. Aquino asked. ``That wasbecause you believed in me. And in spite of all of the coupattempts, you have stuck by me. And I know that I owe my beingpresident to you.''</TEXT></DOC>
