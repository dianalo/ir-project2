After an exhaustive auction overseen by a special RJR directorscommittee, buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. triumphedlate Wednesday over an RJR management group led by chief executiveF. Ross Johnson.   The directors accepted Kohlberg's package of cash and securitiesvalued at $109 a share for each of RJR's 225 million shares for atotal of $24.53 billion, and rejected an offer from Johnson's groupvalued at $112 a share or $25.2 billion.   They said both offers were nearly the same but Kohlberg's offerwould give shareholders a 25 percent stake in the acquired company,compared with a 15 percent stake offered by Johnson.   Both offers would rely heavily on borrowed money to be repaidthrough RJR's earnings, assets or both, a transaction commonlycalled a leveraged buyout. It was widely expected that Kohlbergwould sell many if not all of RJR's food businesses and leave itshighly profitable tobacco business intact.   But Kohlberg principal Henry Kravis told a few selected financialjournalists in New York he foresaw no urgent reason to sell any ofRJR's operations, people familiar with his remarks said.   ``There will be no wholesale dismemberment of the company, noimmediate fire sale, and that is still the case,'' although``obviously some businesses will have to be sold,'' the sourcesparaphrased Kravis as saying.   No decisions have been made yet on what to shed, Kravis wasquoted as saying. He also was said to have described the leveragedbuyout as one of the most conservative his firm had ever donedespite the enormous price.   Disclosing more details of how the takeover will be financed,Kohlberg said in a filing with the Securities and ExchangeCommission today that four banks will lend $2.7 billion and assemblea syndicate of other banks to lend another $14 billion.   In addition, the SEC filing showed, Kohlberg's two main WallStreet financial backers, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and MerrillLynch andamp; Co., will lend $5 billion to be financed by high-yield``junk bonds,'' and Kohlberg's own pool of investors will providethe rest of the money.   Kohlberg is the undisputed leader in leveraged buyouts, whichoften leave acquired companies with staggering debt levels.   For example, Kohlberg's 1986 leveraged buyout of supermarketgiant Safeway Stores Inc. for $4.2 billion left the acquired companywith a debt-to-equity ratio of 10-to-1.   The RJR acquisition will more than quadruple the company'sexisting debt of $5 billion to $22.3 billion. But the amount ofequity in the acquired company is estimated at about $7.4 billion,for a debt-to-equity ratio of 3-to-1. In leveraged buyouts, that isconsidered low.   Although Kravis said he considered the fight for RJR over,Johnson and his chief financial backer, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,hinted Thursday that they were not finished.   Johnson said in a statement he had spoken with Kravis and assuredhim ``that if the board's action results in Kohlberg Kravis Robertsowning the company, I will work with him toward a professional andsmooth transition.''   But the statement also said Johnson and his investment-bankingallies ``are evaluating their options.''   Some analysts speculated that Johnson, considered a daringcorporate boss, might take the unprecedented step of sidesteppingthe board of the company he still heads and making an offer directlyto stockholders.   RJR's stock price rose about 66 percent during the 5-weektakeover saga, partly on the prospect that ever-higher offers wouldemerge. But the stock fell $1.25 Thursday to $91.75 in heavytrading, evidently reflecting the view that Kohlberg's package of$81 in cash and $28 in securities was worth less than its faceamount. The stock retreated another 75 cents this morning to $91.   The RJR takeover battle focused nationwide attention on thegrowing leveraged buyout trend and the enormous debt burdens manycompanies are acquiring in such transactions. Some economists fearthese heavily indebted companies could face unprecedented pressurein a downturn.   Underscoring that concern, Moody's Investors Service lowered thecredit rating on RJR's corporate bonds Thursday, saying it wasworried about the ability of the company to generate enough money toservice its increased debt.   At the same time, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., a large RJRbondholder that sued the company last month when the value of itsbonds sank amid the takeover fight, said Kohlberg's name might beadded as a defendant.</TEXT></DOC>
