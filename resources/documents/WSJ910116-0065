The CBO, in a forecast to be made public tomorrow, seesthe economy growing by 1.3%, after adjusting for inflation,between the fourth quarter of 1990 and the fourth quarter of1991, congressional sources said. The White House and theconsensus of private forecasters surveyed by the Blue ChipEconomic Indicators see 0.9% growth for the same period. TheCBO, White House and private forecasters all expect therecession to end sometime this spring.</LP><TEXT>   In the past, the CBO forecast has been more pessimisticthan the administration's, although not always more accurate.   The new CBO forecast shows the gross national product --the nation's output of goods and services -- shrinking by2.6% in the fourth quarter of 1990 and by 1.7% in the currentquarter. The congressional economists expect the economy willthen grow at an annual rate of 0.8% in the second quarter,2.3% in the third quarter and 3.9% in the fourth quarter.   The less optimistic administration forecast has theeconomy shrinking at a 3.4% annual rate in the fourth quarterand a 1.3% rate in the current quarter. It shows the economygrowing at an annual rate of 0.3% in the second quarter, 2.0%in the third quarter and 2.8% in the fourth quarter.   Both forecasts assume that a war in the Middle East, ifthere is one, won't last long.   Both the White House and the CBO are planning to formallynotify Congress this week that they are forecasting arecession. Under the new budget law, this will trigger a votein the Senate, and possibly in the House, on resolutions toundo last year's deficit-reduction law and allow morespending than was contemplated. Congressional budget aidessay that neither chamber is likely to approve theresolutions.   In the past, administration economists have been underpressure to issue rosy forecasts to help administrationbudgetwriters meet the deficit ceilings in the Gramm-Rudmandeficit-reduction law. Revisions to that law made last yearautomatically adjust deficit targets for changes in theeconomy, liberating administration economists from the oldconstraints.   The Commerce Department will release its first estimate offourth-quarter GNP on Jan. 25.   ---                  How Deep a Recession?
