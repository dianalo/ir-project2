This data has become an importantpart of various gas purchases, gas billing, and gas volume calculations.Today, many gas measurement laboratories are testing hundreds of naturalgas samples monthly to furnish this data. Consequently, the author describesthe gas measurement laboratory devoted mainly to the determination ofthe heating value (BTU) of natural gas samples, related activities, andinnovations.</TEXT></DOC>
