Falanga, a lawyer in the FMS chief counsel's office, flatly deniedthis as well as Andersen's allegations that the agency had acceptedadditional items in CSC's bid that were not commercially available when FMSreceived the offer.andM;Two officials at the National Institute of Standards and Technology said theywere not aware of the protest.andP;  Without knowing any of the specifics in it,Gerard Mulvenna, head of NIST's network applications group, said he waspuzzled by suggestions that GOSIP products might not be availablecommercially.andM;Many major vendors have announced GOSIP-compliant products, he noted.andO;However, other observers pointed out that many of those products have beenannounced but are not yet available.andM;Details of the specific GOSIP products at issue in the protest were notavailable because much of the record in the case has been sealed on groundsthat it contains proprietary information.andM;Shirley Radack, manager for program coordination and support in NIST'sNational Computer Systems Laboratory, said her office has not received anyagency request for waivers since GOSIP Version 1 became mandatory Aug. 15.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
