The 44-L rocket lifted off from the European Space Agency centeron the northeastern Atlantic coast of South America.   Less than a half-hour later, Arianespace, a consortium of 11European countries, said the Intelsat VI satellite had been placedinto orbit.   In the coming days, the satellite is to move into position overcentral Africa to enter service with the Intelsat network of 13satellites.   Manufactured by nine international companies under the directionof the Hughes Aircraft Co. of the United States, Intelsat VI weighs9,500 pounds and measures 39 feet by 12 feet.   With 24,000 simultaneous two-way telephone circuits and threecolor television channels, the satellite will relay telephone,television, fax, telex and data transmissions.   It is the first of a new generation of five satellites plannedto be put into service by the Washington-based InternationalTelecommunications Satellite Organization, a nonprofit cooperativeof 117 nations.   The mission marked the 34th launch since 1979 by Arianespace.The four-stage rocket had been scheduled to lift off Oct. 5 but waspostponed when technicians found problems in the electricalcomponents that operate the vehicle's command systems.   Arianespace has launched 33 satellites for orders totalling$2.14 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
