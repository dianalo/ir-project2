The dramatic announcement, which came after apost-midnight negotiating session in Moscow, puts PresidentBush in a political bind. He won't like the terms Iraq hasagreed to, because they clearly are designed to leave SaddamHussein in power with a significant military establishmentstill intact. A senior administration official said lastnight that the U.S. has &quot;serious problems&quot; with the peaceplan.</LP><TEXT>   Nevertheless, the Iraqi formula came close enough tomeeting Mr. Bush's frequent demands for an &quot;unconditionalwithdrawal&quot; that the U.S. will find it hard to dismiss it outof hand -- and equally hard to launch a bloody ground warwhile the proposal remains pending. The plan actuallycontains the seeds of a significant political victory for Mr.Bush, if he can nurture it successfully. And Press SecretaryMarlin Fitzwater said last night that the U.S. would studythe plan.   Mr. Fitzwater said that President Bush, in a lengthytelephone conversation, told Mr. Gorbachev he has &quot;seriousconcerns&quot; about the plan. For now, the allies will &quot;continueto prosecute the war,&quot; he added. In fact, some militaryofficials said allied bombing likely would intensify whilediplomatic maneuvering continues so that more Iraqi targetscan be destroyed before a possible cease-fire begins.   Rep. Lee Hamilton, for one, last night said that while theproposal has deficiencies it goes far enough that the U.S.should postpone a ground war for now while continuingmilitary pressure in other ways. The Indiana Democrat, asenior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, admitted thatthe plan presents a dilemma for the U.S., but said it &quot;faradvances any previous proposal.&quot;   Most important, last night's plan was the first Iraqiwithdrawal offer that wasn't encumbered by any linkage toother Middle East problems, notably the Palestinian issue.That has been the main sticking point that has brought promptBush administration objections to past formulas from Baghdadand Moscow.   The survival of a still-potent Saddam Hussein would be aproblem not only for President Bush but for many of America'schief allies, particularly Israel. And many leaders of Arabcoalition partners -- Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria --privately have been hoping the U.S. will proceed with thecrushing ground assault on Iraqi troops that seemed imminentbefore the Iraqi announcement. Having enraged Saddam Hussein,leaders of those Arab states aren't eager to live with him.   Yet some allied Arab officials also worry about the sightof their American friends gunning down hundreds or thousandsof Arab soldiers from Iraq; this may leave them as torn nowas Mr. Bush.   Above all, the U.S. will be unhappy that the plan wouldremove economic sanctions after only two-thirds of Iraqiforces are withdrawn. In addition, it doesn't set a specific,speedy timetable for a withdrawal, and it would cancel allU.N. resolutions that provide for postwar punishment. Thoseaspects of the plan might allow Saddam Hussein time towithdraw all his military gear, and to quickly rebuild hiseconomy so that he can purchase new weapons.   And there are other questions. The Soviets said moredetails will be announced today, which carries potentialpromise and peril for the plan's success. The U.S. is alsogrowing suspicious of the Soviet role in rescuing its oldally, Iraq. And it's clear that Iraq, like the U.S., isn'tgoing to stop its armed actions in the meantime; the Moscowannouncement barely had been delivered when Iraqi Scudmissile attacks were reported near eastern Saudi Arabia.   So President Bush seems certain to press for changes inthe Soviet-Iraqi formula that would allow the United NationsSecurity Council to leave economic sanctions in place. He'llalso want a timetable for withdrawal that would force SaddamHussein to leave much of his weaponry behind, as well asassurances that the U.N. can continue pressing Iraq to paywar reparations.   &quot;Let's be very cautious,&quot; said Sen. Robert Dole, theSenate minority leader and a close White House ally. &quot;Let'sremember that Saddam Hussein may be playing a stalling game.&quot;   But Mr. Bush also now seems caught in the gap between theformal war aims he and the United Nations have proclaimed --which focus narrowly on Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait and therestoration of Kuwait's rulers -- and the allies' unofficialdesire to do away with Saddam Hussein's regime along the way.   The announcement of the peace plan in Moscow occurred onlyhours after Saddam Hussein had delivered a defiant speech inBaghdad in which he seemed to dare the U.S. and its allies tolaunch a ground attack to drive his troops out of Kuwait.That speech now looks as if it was an attempt to deliver afinal rhetorical blast to save face in the Arab world beforeseeking a diplomatic cover for withdrawal.   The eight-point Iraqi proposal, a response to a plan putforward by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, was read byVitaly Ignatenko, a Soviet spokesman, around 2:30 a.m. Moscowtime (6:30 p.m. EST).   &quot;It is possible to find a way out of the military conflictin the Gulf,&quot; Mr. Ignatenko announced. He then proceeded tooutline a plan he said Iraq had accepted under which Iraqwould stage a &quot;full and unconditional withdrawal&quot; fromKuwait. The pullout would begin on the second day afterhostilities stopped -- an apparent reference to a cease-fire.It would occur in an unspecified, but &quot;fixed,&quot; time frame.   U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq would be lifted oncetwo-thirds of the Iraqi troops had withdrawn. After thewithdrawal, the U.N. resolutions condemning and punishingIraq for its invasion of Kuwait would cease to exist. Oncethe ceasefire had taken effect, all prisoners of war would bereleased.   The withdrawal of Iraqi forces would be monitored bycountries appointed by the U.N. Security Council that aren'tdirectly involved in the war. Further details of how the planwould work were still being worked out in Moscow and are tobe forwarded to the security council sometime today.   The eight points contained some elements that Mr. Bush hadprivately told Moscow just this week that he needed in anydeal, including freeing of war prisoners and a timetable forwithdrawal. If Iraq really is prepared to withdraw fromKuwait, which it proudly proclaimed for six months as itspermanent &quot;19th province,&quot; Mr. Bush could frame that alone asa significant diplomatic and political victory.   It would look particularly stunning because it would havebeen achieved with a surprisingly low level of U.S.casualties -- 20 U.S. soldiers killed in combat and 23American planes lost in fighting to date. Moreover, theadministration could at least hope that the politicalhumiliation of a withdrawal after the damage his country hasendured would undercut Saddam Hussein at home and eventuallycause him to be toppled from within.   But the plan was vague on many details, such as just whatthe timetable for withdrawal would be. And it was silent onother points Mr. Bush sought, such as Iraqi help in clearingmines from Kuwait.   U.S. officials have speculated all along that SaddamHussein might choose survival over continued occupation ofKuwait when he thought his options were that stark. Iraq'sacceptance of the agreement suggests that, after 35 days offerocious bombing by U.S. and allied warplanes, the Iraqileader now may see that his position has become tooprecarious.   But for precisely that same reason, some U.S. officialshave grown increasingly eager to press on with the war tofinish off Iraq's military machine while the chance isavailable. What's more, officials suggest that they havehoped not only to drive his forces out of Kuwait but also todeliver a death blow along the way to the elite RepublicanGuard that have been instrumental in keeping Saddam Husseinin power.   Officials now suggest, in fact, that a central purpose ofthe land offensive wouldn't be simply to drive Iraqi troopsout of Kuwait but to destroy the Republican Guard unitssitting along the Kuwait-Iraq border. Those units areessential to Saddam Hussein both politically and militarily,for the Guards are his best fighters as well as the trustedhome guard that protects him from coups and militaryinsurrection from within.   By bloodying the Guards now, the U.S. may hope to make itmore difficult for Saddam Hussein to survive and causetrouble down the road, even if he is left standing when thewar ends.   For this reason, officials say the relentless alliedbombardment of bridges crossing the Tigris and Euphratesrivers has been aimed not only at cutting supply lines butalso at making it more difficult for the Guards to escapewith their heavy equipment to the north when fightingintensifies. &quot;They want to destroy the Republican Guard,&quot;said one person familiar with the thinking of the U.S.military command in Saudi Arabia.   Now, the Bush administration has to face the prospect ofgiving up that hope. And that is a problem for America's Arabfriends as well. Saddam Hussein just yesterday viciouslyattacked both Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and SaudiArabian King Fahd in his radio address, calling them lackeysof the U.S. and traitors to the Arab and Islamic worlds --and virtually inviting their overthrow or slaying. Saudileaders, in particular, don't want the war to stop untilSaddam Hussein is out of power because they must share along, thinly guarded border with an Iraq that even now couldremain militarily more powerful than the thinly populatedSaudi kingdom.   Syrian President Hafez Assad will be equally chagrined ifSaddam Hussein, also a neighbor of Syria, is still around tomake trouble. Syria has hoped that the demise of his regimewould increase Syrian power in the region.   Egypt's Mr. Mubarak is likely to have more ambivalentfeelings. He, too, would be more comfortable if SaddamHussein were finished. But in Egypt, more than in SaudiArabia, there was growing popular sentiment not toparticipate in a ground war in which Iraqi soldiers might beslaughtered.   For Israel, there also would be unhappiness if SaddamHussein's military machine isn't further dismantled in war.Still, no matter how the diplomatic maneuvering turns out,Israel already has seen the Iraqi chemical, biological andnuclear weapons capabilities it most feared wiped out byallied bombing raids.   For the U.S., one of the public complaints is likely toinvolve the failure of the plan to comply with all 12 U.N.resolutions passed to compel Iraq to leave Kuwait. But infact, many of them either aren't binding or have beenovertaken by events.   Five of the resolutions deal with various aspects of theeconomic embargo. Others pertain to such matters as thetreatment of embassies in Kuwait City, which are now closed,and to freeing Western hostages, who were released before thewar started. The murkiest U.N. statement deals withreparations or war-crimes charges Iraq might have to faceafter the war. Though the Security Council voted to hold Iraqliable for war damages and invited countries to collectevidence for a possible judicial process later, no suchprocess was actually established.   The broader dilemma is that the proposal forces Mr. Bushto make a choice he had hoped to avoid: between the prospectof achieving the minimum goal of freeing Kuwait withoutfurther bloodshed, and the chance to crush President Husseinand his military might at the risk of a bloody ground war.   By presenting Mr. Bush with that choice, Saddam Husseinmay not only be posing an agonizing decision but finallytaking a step toward splitting the extraordinaryinternational coalition that Mr. Bush built -- many of whosemembers will want to accept the Iraqi withdrawal and declarevictory.   And the Soviets, whose help was instrumental in pressingthe anti-Iraq campaign at the U.N., certainly will urgeAmerican acceptance. That, too, poses a dilemma for Mr. Bush.   Increasingly Mr. Gorbachev's Kremlin, which is influencedmore and more by oldline military officers and partyhardliners, has seemed to want to preserve its old ally,Saddam Hussein, to ensure Soviet influence in the MiddleEast. That makes U.S. officials suspect Soviet motives as apeacemaker -- and also raises questions about whether thediplomatic process now under way could lead to a lesshospitable new order in the region than the U.S. had oncehoped.
