We findstrong evidence that a scaling solution does indeed exist. This justifiesthe main assumption on which the cosmic-string theories of galaxy formationare based. Our main conclusion coincides with that of Albrecht and Turokin previous work, but our results are not consistent with theirs. Infact, our results indicate that the details of string evolution are verydifferent from the standard dogma.</TEXT></DOC>
