JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Raytheon Co. won a $180 million contract fromthe Federal Aviation Administration to install special radarequipment to detect wind shears at major airports beginning in theearly l990s.   A wind shear is a sudden change of wind direction that causes apowerful downburst of air much like water gushing from a faucet. Theair gust is enough to drive a jetliner into the ground when it islanding or departing.   The Transportation Department announced the contract Wednesdayand said the ``Doppler'' radar will give air traffic controllers andpilots a significant safety improvement.   Powerful wind shears called microbursts have been the cause of atleast five airline accidents that claimed more than 500 lives in thelast 15 years, including the l985 crash of a Delta Air Lines jetthat killed 137 people near Dallas.   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said no final decision has been made onwhere the radars would be installed. Agency officials previouslyhave said the 47 airports would be those with the highest trafficlevels and a history of wind shear problems.   The FAA also said it has an option for 55 additional radars atother airports, costing another $100 million, in the event that itreceives final approval from administration budget planners andCongress to expand the program.   ``The terminal Doppler system has a greater potential forrealizing safety gains than perhaps any other individual item ofequipment (in the FAA's air traffic modernization program),'' saidTransportation Secretary Jim Burnley in a statement.   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor said the introduction of theradar along the approach and departure paths of major airports is``a major step'' in providing controllers and pilots with better andquicker adverse weather warnings.   Last summer in a 60-day test program at Denver's StapletonAirport, a Doppler radar prototype detected 47 strong shears withinfive miles of the airport and more than 200 over the entire area ofits coverage, officials said.   Under the multi-year contract, Raytheon's Equipment Division atWayland, Mass., will provide the first terminal Doppler radar to theFAA's Technical Center in Atlantic City, N.J., in the fall of l991with the first radar for airport delivery in late l992, the FAA said.   The FAA has had mechanical wind monitoring equipment at manymajor airports for a number of years, but experts have said theequipment cannot cover along the entire approach and takeoff pathsused by jetliners and, therefore, is of minimal benefit.   The wind monitors were in use at the Dallas-Fort WorthInternational Airport when a Delta Air Lines Lockheed L-1011encountered a powerful microburst during an approach Aug. 2, 1985causing it to crash and kill 137 people.   The mechanical monitors also were at the New Orleans airport onJuly 9, l982 when a Pan American World Airways jet encountered awind shear as it took off. The Boeing 727 crashed, killing 153people.</TEXT></DOC>
