But IBM said it is mainly interested inusing them to shuttle data between its computers and distantstorage devices, such as the big clusters of disk drives usedby many companies.   In the future, the method may also help move data withincomputers -- even within computer chips -- speeding theiroperation, IBM said. The Armonk, N.Y., company wouldn't sayif it would license its technology to other firms for otheruses.   IBM's process is similar to one used to mass-producecomputer chips, meaning that the lasers can easily be made inlarge numbers. IBM said several of its chip-making facilitieswill be able to make the lasers with slight modification andthat the new devices would start showing up in IBM productsin &quot;a year or two.&quot;   But the new process enjoys economies beyond allowingproduction in existing facilities. A bigger advantage is thatit allows IBM to test the lasers in batches of as many as20,000 units; testing is a major expense in laser-making. IBMestimated that its method will be 50% cheaper than currentprocesses, and said it will also be faster and moreefficient.   IBM said it used a chip-making process to etch smalltrenches into 2-inch-diameter wafers of laser material. Thenit covered the trenches with a reflective material thatturned them into tiny mirrors. After each wafer was tested,it was cut into as many as 20,000 separate lasers.   By contrast, current laser-making methods form mirrors bybreaking the wafer into tiny pieces; the broken edges thenact as reflecting surfaces. Since the lasers aren't finisheduntil their mirrors are made, devices must then be tested oneat a time.   While IBM's method isn't revolutionary technology, itspromise of big savings is likely to shake up the world ofsemiconductor lasers, as the tiny devices are called.   &quot;This is the first big announcement that I've seen fromU.S. industry in semiconductor lasers for quite some time,&quot;said Will Strauss at Forward Concepts Co., a Tempe, Ariz.,market-research firm. &quot;Most of the news comes from Japan.&quot;   Daniel Wilt, a technical supervisor at ATandamp;T's BellLaboratories, agreed that the advance is important. &quot;Rightnow, there are a lot of markets that are closed tosemiconductor lasers because of cost,&quot; he said. He estimatedthat IBM's method, if done well, could cut the cost of eachsemiconductor laser from $10 to $1.   Mr. Wilt said the new method could help ATandamp;T with adifferent kind of laser it is developing fortelecommunications. &quot;It would be a very significant advancein indium phosphide,&quot; the laser material ATandamp;T is workingwith, he said. IBM's lasers, which are bigger and slower thanATandamp;T's, are made of aluminum gallium arsenide.   Toshiba Corp., cited by Mr. Strauss as the leader insemiconductor lasers until now, couldn't be reached forcomment.</TEXT></DOC>
