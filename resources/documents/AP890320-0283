On the ninth day of deliberations Sunday, the jury in the firstcriminal trial linked to the confessions of Ivan Boesky reheard moreof two hours of testimony but gave no indication it was closer tobreaking the impasse.   U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe told the panel of ninewomen and three men to reconsider the evidence after the panelreported the split Saturday. The sole juror said he or she couldshift positions ``under no circumstances.''   The jury was sequestered March 10 after a six-week retrial.Attorneys for both sides declined to comment Sunday on theprotracted deliberations.   The case in federal court in Manhattan is considered a key testof the government's ability to try Wall Street corruption emanatingfrom the insider trading scandals of the mid-1980s. It is the firstsecurities fraud case to reach the trial stage.   GAF and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, have denied chargesof trying to boost the price of Union Carbide Corp. stock in October1986 in an attempt to reap gains from the planned sale of a largeblock of shares. They are charged with eight counts including stockmanipulation, conspiracy, wire fraud and securities fraud.   The jury, in a note read in court Saturday, asked the judge forhelp in resolving the deadlock but did not say whether the majorityfavored acquittal or conviction. The move came after more than 65hours of deliberations.   ``Your honor. We need help. There are 11 jurors who have come toa unanimous decision on counts one through eight and one juror whodoes not agree,'' the jury said.   Lowe said that before declaring a mistrial because of thedeadlock, she wanted the jurors to reassess their positions. But shesaid jurors should not vote against their conscience just becausethey were outnumbered.   Lowe called a mistrial Jan. 10 after ruling the prosecutionunintentionally withheld from the defense a piece of evidence thatshowed a key document had been altered.   An acquittal would be a major setback for the Manhattan U.S.attorney's office, which chose GAF as its leadoff case in a seriesof securities fraud trials set for this year.   Prosecutors based the GAF case on information supplied by Boyd L.Jefferies, a Los Angeles broker who was fingered by Boesky in late1986 and testify under an agreement with the government. He alreadyhas agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts for breakingsecurities laws.   Boesky, a former arbitrager, is serving a three-year term forinsider trading charges under a settlement in which he also paid$100 million in fines and restitution.   Jefferies' testimony is considered central to the Boesky-derivedtrials of speculator Salim B. Lewis and takeover specialist PaulBilzerian later this year. Attorneys for those two defendants havebeen attending the GAF trial.   During deliberations, the jury asked to rehear testimony ofJefferies and several other witnesses, as well as review charts,tables and other documents presented during the six-week trial.   GAF, a Wayne, N.J.-based chemical and building materialsmanufacturer, and two subsidiaries face a maximum total fine of $12million. Sherwin, 55, of Princeton, N.J., faces 40 years in prisonand a fine of up to $2 million.</TEXT></DOC>
