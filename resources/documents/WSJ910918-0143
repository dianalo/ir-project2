In a notice in the Federal Register, the department saidit is suspending export licenses previously granted to theNEC unit, Japan Aviation Electronics Industry Ltd., and toAero Systems Inc., Japan Aviation's alleged U.S. partner inthe Iran sales. The order will prevent the companies fromexporting U.S.-made arms and also deny them the right toobtain new licenses to export U.S. armaments.</LP><TEXT>   These administrative sanctions come on the heels of acriminal indictment of the two companies and Aero Systems'Hong Kong and Singapore subsidiaries by a federal grand juryin Washington. A federal court has yet to determine where theparties are to be arraigned.   The indictment alleged that in the late 1980s, the twocompanies conspired to ship U.S.-made navigational equipmentto be installed in Iran's leftover fleet of F-4 jets. Thecompanies allegedly shipped the goods without receiving StateDepartment approval.   The State Department order could hurt some of JapanAviation's existing business. According to Japanese tradepublications, Japan Aviation has acquired various types ofaircraft components from several U.S. companies. JapanAviation was licensed to sell the equipment only in Japan.None of those U.S. suppliers were implicated in the federalinvestigation that led to Japan Aviation's Sept. 4indictment.   Japan Aviation also faces possible administrativepenalties in Tokyo. Four of its former executives wereindicted last week for allegedly violating Japanese tradelaws.   A Japan Aviation spokesman said the company had not beennotified of the State Department decision and could notcomment immediately. Aero Systems didn't respond to callsabout the indictment.</TEXT></DOC>
