These software templates of expert-systemprograms help non-programmers develop expert systems.andM;A Step-by-Step ProcessandM;''[Simplates] get developers started by asking questions,'' he said.andP;  ''Thedeveloper fills in the blanks, and the system generates code.''andM;Keller is also planning to release a simplate for the Level5 programminglanguage from Information Builders Inc.andP;  He also plans a summer release of asimplate for 1st-Class, though he says it's one of the easiest expert-systemshells to use.andM;Other expert-system shells, such as KnowledgePro from Knowledge Garden Inc.,andO;also have incorporated hypertext.andP;  Some of these, however, are moresophisticated, according to Keller.andM;1st-Class HT, sold directly by 1st-Class Expert Systems, costs $2,495.andM;The company can be reached at (800) 872-8812.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
