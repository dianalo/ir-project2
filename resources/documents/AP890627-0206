Charles E. Schumer,D-N.Y., as the House approved the measure 368-47 and sent it to theSenate.   Supporters said the nation is being hit by a growing wave ofso-called hate crimes, ranging from gang attacks on members ofminority groups to cross burnings and the spray painting ofswastikas and bigoted slogans.   Under the bill, statistics would be collected on homicide,assault, robbery, burglary, theft, arson, vandalism, trespassing,threats and others deemed appropriate by the Justice Department ifthey involved bias involving race, ethnicity, sexual preference orreligion.   The House has passed similar measures in the past but the Senatehas not acted. A hate crimes bill was approved by the SenateJudiciary Committee on March 9 and supporters are hoping for a floorvote.   The FBI publishes annual crime statistics but does not includehate crimes. Supporters have relied on unofficial reports andanecdotal information from news accounts in estimating that theproblem is growing worse.   Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y., said 1,281 anti-semitic incidents werereported by the Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'rith in 1988. Hesaid the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force reported 7,008incidents of anti-gay violence in 1987. ``There is also evidence ofgrowing Klan, neo-Nazi, skinhead and other hate group activitythroughout the nation,'' Green said.   ``The tremendous rise in crimes against minorities is widespreadand extremely serious,'' Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said.   Compiling data on such acts would help in fighting them,supporters said ``The more we know about crimes of hate the morechance we have of preventing them,'' said Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly,D-Conn.   ``Congress should send a clear signal to all people that crimesbased on race, religion or sexuality will not be tolerated,'' saidRep. Ben Gilman, R-N.Y.</TEXT></DOC>
