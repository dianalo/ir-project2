But his deaf ear to public cries for more democracy led toa second exodus, and he was through.   Honecker, 77, was removed from leadership Wednesday after 18years as Communist Party chief.   He oversaw the building of socialism's strongest economy and aperiod of steadily improved relations with both East and West.   But the short, bespectacled Communist failed to fall in stepwith the new march of communism in Eastern Europe.   The East Berlin government under Honecker defended China'sbloody crackdown of the pro-democracy movement in June, and violentclashes between security forces and demonstrators were reported inmajor East German cities during and after Soviet President MikhailS. Gorbachev's visit Oct. 6-7 to East Berlin.   When tens of thousands took to the streets of Leipzig to demandthe kinds of reforms sweeping Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union,Honecker's state media branded them ``hooligans.''   More than 53,000 others lost faith the system could be changedunder Honecker or his hand-picked successor and fled to WestGermany over the past two months.   Honecker's health was blamed for his departure. He is known tohave suffered complications from gallbladder surgery this pastsummer. West German intelligence reports said he has cancer.   But his outmoded views of socialist dictates probably inflictedmore damage than any illness.   Under Honecker, East German border guards for years had ordersto shoot anyone who tried to flee the country. At least 91 peoplewere shot to death after the Berlin Wall went up in 1961 to cut offan escape route to the West.   Honecker, born in what is now West Germany, rejected allsuggestions that the two Germanys be reunited. ``Socialism andcapitalism can be no more united than fire and water,'' hecommented during his historic visit to West Germany in 1987.   After rising to party leadership in 1971, Honecker adopted apolicy of tolerance toward the Protestant Church and pursued abrand of ``consumer socialism'' that gave his people the Eastbloc's most advanced standard of living. However, the economy lagsfar behind that of West Germany and most Western nations.   Unlike his Stalinist predecessor, Walter Ulbricht, Honeckershowed interest in detente and improved relations with West Germany.   But his repression of political dissent, his role in buildingthe Berlin Wall and his maintenance of fortress-like borders withWest Germany signaled the limits of moderation in East Germany.   Little is known of Honecker's personal life, except he divorcedhis first wife to marry Margot Feist, who now is education minister.   Honecker was born Aug. 25, 1912, in Saarland, and joined aCommunist youth group at age 14.   The Nazis imprisoned him in 1935 and he didn't get out until theinvading Soviet Red Army arrived a decade later.   Honecker caught Ulbricht's eye in the fledgling postwar regimecreated in 1949 in the Soviet occupation zone of the defeated ThirdReich.   In 1958, he gained his first powerful government posts, risingto membership in the ruling Politburo and becoming a CentralCommittee secretary with responsibility for state security.   In 1961, Ulbricht assigned Honecker to direct construction ofthe Berlin Wall.   As late as this year, Honecker said the wall would remain aslong as the reasons for its construction persist _ the loss ofcrucial labor capacity to the West.</TEXT></DOC>
