For the quarter ending June 1, the software company saidit expects to report earnings ranging from 27 cents to 35cents a share, on revenue of $32 million to $35 million. Itadded that it expected results for the remaining two quartersof the year to improve from second-quarter level, but that itexpected fiscal 1990 results to be below analysts' currentexpectations.</LP><TEXT>   In the 1989 fiscal-second quarter, Adobe had net income of$7.6 million, or 35 cents a share, on revenue of $28.1million.   &quot;It is startling,&quot; said Bruce Lupatkin, a software analystat Hambrecht andamp; Quist in San Francisco. Adobe stock will &quot;takea major beating tomorrow,&quot; he added. The company estimateswere dislosed after markets closed yesterday. Adobe, finishedat $50.50 a share, up $1.50, in national over-the-countertrading.   Mr. Lupatkin said he had expected second-quarter per-shareearnings of 51 cents and revenue of $42 million.   Adobe cited lower-than-expected revenue from Apple,reflecting a 23% drop in shipment of Apple productsincorporating Adobe technology compared with the firstquarter.   The company also said two other &quot;significant customers&quot; --NEC Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. -- wereexperiencing reduced shipments because of new productdevelopment and delays.   Adobe develops and sells programs that create images andtype fonts on desktop computer screens and printers. Lastfall, Apple, along with software giant Microsoft Corp., saidthey would offer a product that would rival Adobe'stechnology, but Apple has continued to be Adobe's mostimportant client. In March, IBM gave Adobe a boost when itsaid it would provide Adobe's printer software with its OS/2operating system for IBM PCs.   &quot;Adobe appears to be caught in a jetwash of a transitionhere,&quot; said Mr. Lupatkin, noting that companies such as IBMare &quot;ramping up volumes, while Apple is fading into thesunset. It is a transitional issue.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
