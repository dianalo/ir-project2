The attorneys said the information might help them prove theircontention that former White House aide Oliver North asked the FBIand CIA to infiltrate LaRouche groups because they were interferingwith North's private Contra-resupply effort.   Also Friday, the trial judge again delayed the resumption oftestimony in the fraud and conspiracy case against LaRouche, sixaides and five organizations because of pending searches ofgovernment records, including those of the White House and VicePresident George Bush, for any evidence suggesting infiltration ofLaRouche groups.   A prosecutor said the records searches ordered by U.S. DistrictJudge Robert E. Keeton would take up to three weeks.   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham urged the judge to allowtestimony to continue in the interim, but defense lawyers said theywould be unable to competently question witnesses without firsthaving all evidence of possible government infiltration of LaRouchegroups.   Keeton said the earliest the jury would be called back to courtwas Tuesday. He also said he would decide Monday if a longer delaywas necessary.   Also Friday, the LaRouche attorneys unleashed several newallegations of prosecutorial and government misconduct. Theycharged the government withheld documents favorable to defenseclaims that evidence against LaRouche and followers was fabricatedby government agents working undercover in the politicalextremist's organizations.   In a memo sent to North by retired Air Force Maj. Gen. RichardSecord, one of North's principal operatives in the Contra-resupplynetwork, Secord said that ``our man'' told him retired Army Sgt.Maj. Fred Lewis had gathered ``info against LaRouche.''   Lewis is the executive vice president of Rhyolite ManagementSystems, a Texas company the LaRouche lawyers contend was one ofseveral private companies run by former military officers used bythe CIA to carry out covert activities.   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham had told LaRouche defenselawyers that ``our man'' referred to Oliver ``Buck'' Revell, a topFBI official involved in counterintelligence operations. Markhamsince has said he was mistaken and that the reference was to JohnCupp, a Secord associate who worked in the resupply effort.   Secord and Cupp, in interviews this week, also have said thereference was to Cupp. Both denied any role in or knowledge of agovernment effort to spy on LaRouche.   ``If `our man here' is in fact Oliver Revell, it would create amotive for high-level forces in the FBI and National SecurityCouncil to conceal that in order to protect Mr. Revell,'' thedefense motion said.   Markham did not immediately respond to the request forinformation concerning Revell. An FBI spokesman earlier this weekrefused to relay questions from The Associated Press to Revell,saying the agency would not comment on matters that were at issuein a current trial.   An FBI document declassified this week quotes Lewis and twoother men as saying top FBI and CIA officials asked them toinfiltrate LaRouche groups. LaRouche lawyers said they had evidencethe three asked LaRouche aides to assist them in illegal activities.   Markham contended in a document filed Friday that Lewis and thetwo other men were lying when they said they had been asked toinfiltrate LaRouche groups.   LaRouche attorney Odin Anderson also said Friday that he hadevidence showing Revell intervened to block a planned meetingbetween LaRouche and William Clark, who at the time of the allegedincident was President Reagan's national security adviser.</TEXT></DOC>
