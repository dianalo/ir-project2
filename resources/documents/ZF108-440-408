tipsandM;New font conflicts.andP;  Many users with large type libraries will recall thechaos that arose a couple of years ago over Mac font-ID-number conflicts.andO;This problem popped up as the number of available fonts expanded past the Macsystem's capacity to identify them uniquely.andP;  It could cause documents toprint with incorrect fonts when a file was moved from one Mac to another atdifferent locations.andP;  A number of conditions, most notably the rise ofApple's NFNT numbering scheme, helped to lessen the problem to the pointwhere, although it is still possible to have font-ID conflicts, most servicebureaus and large organizations know of the problem and how to resolve it.andM;The PostScript type market has since shown explosive growth.andP;  Now differentvendors offer their own versions of typeface families.andP;  For instance, bothBitstream and Adobe offer versions of Galliard that are similar in look butare not identical.andP;  Differences will show up in the look and the width of thecharacters, although in many cases the differences will be minor.andP;  Many othercompanies also have overlapping libraries.andM;This situation has given rise to a new Mac font conflict that has beenlurking in the background and gathering steam.andP;  The problem should not be assevere as the earlier font problem, but users with large font librariesshould be aware of its existence and how to combat it.andM;This conflict doesn't involve the Mac screen fonts; it involves the names ofthe downloadable outline-font files that make up PostScript typefaces.andP;  Thesefiles are used in conjunction with the Mac screen fonts.andP;  When a typeface isneeded during the printing process, the Mac's LaserWriter driver transmitsthe proper outline file to the printer.andP;  The file name is created by thevendor and identifies the typeface to the PostScript interpreter so that itis used properly during printing.andP;  If you rename the outline file, the fontwill not print properly.andM;What's in a name?andP;  Unfortunately, some companies have used the samePostScript name to identify their outline font files.andP;  To further confuse theproblem, the standard weight is usually uniquely named, but the bold, italicand compound weights often have similar names.andM;We found quite a few conflicts with different companies' libraries.andP;  Forexample, Casady andamp; Greene's Bodoni family had printer-font files namedBodonLas (regular weight), BodonIta (italic), BodonBol (bold) and BodonBolIta(bold italic).andP;  The names of the corresponding Adobe printer-font files werethe same for all but the regular weight, which was named Bodon.andM;The result of this is that someone could be using an Adobe Bodoni screen-fontfile while downloading Casady andamp; Greene's or Bitstream's PostScript outlines.andO;What you would get would be a non-WYSIWYG document that would have differentline endings and word spacing between the screen and printed output.andM;Most users won't encounter this problem, but service bureaus and companieswith large font libraries could find strange inconsistencies when printingdocuments, especially as they move around from Mac to Mac and from site tosite.andM;The best way to bypass the problem is to use a utility such as FifthGeneration Systems' Suitcase II or ALSoft's Font/DA Juggler Plus to managefonts.andP;  Keep fonts from different vendors in separate folders and make surethat you do not simultaneously load two different versions of a screen font.andO;If you are working with a service bureau, make sure that you provide a listof all typefaces used and include the vendor of the face as well.andM;Most font companies that we talked to are aware of the problem and hope tofix it as they introduce new typeface packages, although existing typefaceconflicts will be hard to remedy.andP;  The simplest solution is to use a specialprefix for the printer-file name that identifies the company.andP;  Monotypealready does this, prefixing all its type with the letter &quot;M.&quot; We hope theother major font manufacturers will follow suit.andM;We welcome comments at MacWEEK, 4 Cambridge Center, Third Floor, Cambridge,Mass.andP;
