(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The son of suspended Navajo ChairmanPeter MacDonald appeared before a tribal court after specialprosecutors asked for an arrest warrant to force his return to thereservation.   Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr. pleaded innocent Friday in NavajoDistrict Court to conspiracy charges stemming from the tribe's 1987purchase of a northern Arizona ranch.   The younger MacDonald had failed to show up at two otherarraignments, claiming that the Tribal Court had no jurisdictionover him because he no longer lives on the reservation and becausethe alleged crimes took place off-reservation.   Defense attorney Donald Benally told District Judge RobertYazzie the younger MacDonald's failure to appear before was ``basedon a misunderstanding.''   But special prosecutor Mark Donatelli said the younger MacDonaldagreed to the arraignment when he realized that the tribal judgewas planning to issue a bench warrant for his arrest and to startextradition proceedings against him.   ``I think he was just trying to see how far he could push thecourt,'' Donatelli said.   Yazzie released the younger MacDonald on his own recognizancebut ordered him to have weekly contact with his lawyer.   The senior MacDonald has been on paid administrative leave sinceFeb. 17. On Wednesday, he pleaded innocent to 107 criminal chargesalleging he received more than $500,000 in illegal contributionsand kickbacks from 1986 to 1988.   The elder MacDonald was charged by special prosecutors withconspiracy, bribery, fraud, extortion and election-law violations.The charges focus on the tribe's purchase of the Big BoquillasRanch from non-Indian middlemen who made a $7.2 million profit onthe property.</TEXT></DOC>
