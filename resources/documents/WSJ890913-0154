If you think America is losing its ability to compete, that other nations are conspiring to steal our technology and monopolize our markets, you ought to think again, especially if the focus of your worry is Japan. America, Mr. Gilder argues, actually is ahead of Japan in some of the high-tech races most people think it's losing.    In computing, for instance, American companies actually hold 70% of the world-wide market, and their lead will increase, Mr. Gilder says, as software becomes more important. In areas where we have fallen behind, say in some areas of semiconductor technology, we can blame our own misjudgment more than the government-led attacks from the Far East.    Rather than focusing on meaningless balance-of-trade statistics or trying to imitate Japan's bureaucratic planners, he argues, our government could do more to rebuild America's economic might by encouraging our spirit of enterprise.    It's a controversial thesis, and bound to be unpopular with advocates of national industrial policies. But &quot;Microcosm&quot; -- which trails the formidable subtitle &quot;The Quantum Revolution in Economics and Technology&quot; -- should enlighten even those who reject its economic and political analysis.    Mr. Gilder explores the future of technology through one of its supreme creations, the microchip, the heart of the modern computer. &quot;More than any device,&quot; Mr. Gilder says, &quot;the microchip epitomizes the overthrow of matter.&quot;    Vividly describing the achievements of such visionaries as Carver Mead, the now famous Cal Tech professor of computer science, and Federico Faggin, principal designer of the most important early microprocessors, Mr. Gilder guides the reader easily through some of the most complex developments in contemporary computer science, from parallel processing to artificial intelligence. Consider the transistors now used in computers: They are smaller than the cells of the human brain, operate much more rapidly and will improve by a factor of at least a hundred before the limits of physics are reached.    So why don't we build computers that outthink us? Because we don't know how. Half a century of studying computers has taught us a lot about how the brain doesn't work, but very little about how it does. So until recently, trying to design better computers by analyzing the brain has been about as fruitful as trying to design an airplane by analyzing feathers and flapping wings. This may change, though Mr. Gilder doesn't make as much of some new developments as he might.    A number of labs, for instance, are finding the so-called biological models of computing increasingly useful in their work. It was a study of animal functions that helped a research team led by Prof. Mead to produce a chip called the &quot;See-Hear,&quot; which converts light patterns into sound. Some day, these chips may help the blind to get an idea of the room they are in by listening to pitches.    Such advances will improve the ways in which computers connect to the world around them by introducing new sensors into automated recognition systems, navigation systems and industrial automation. All such inventions will affect the way we do business, defend ourselves or spend our free time. We see this already: &quot;By overcoming the constraints of material resources, the microchip has devalued most large accumulations of physical capital and made possible the launching of global economic enterprises by one entrepreneur at a workstation.&quot;    Not all the chapters seem as integrated as the integrated circuit industry of which Mr. Gilder writes so smoothly. Some readers will be puzzled at the space he devotes to criticizing the Strategic Defense Initiative (he says it uses flawed technology -- a few immense computers instead of networks of many small computers). Others surely will balk at his objections to any federal aid for high-definition television.    Mr. Gilder also is fond of overstatement. Some examples: &quot;Selling below cost is the crux of all enterprise.&quot; &quot;We bar immigrants from technical conferences devoted to the exploration of findings that only they can fully understand.&quot; He also is wrong in thinking that the Cal Tech labs have succeeded in creating a microcircuit that mimics parts of the eye. One day such a circuit could dramatically transform the semiconductor and computer industries by making it possible to build very complex computers on wafers of silicon about the size of a compact disk. But this wafer-scale integration process remains elusive and was, in fact, responsible for one of the computer industry's largest financial disasters, the Trilogy Corp. debacle of the early '80s.    But such glitches fade amid the vivid stories Mr. Gilder tells of the oddballs who thrive in a field that favors those whose blood, as he writes, is rarely blue and whose money is rarely seasoned: &quot;The United States did not enter the microcosm through the portals of the Ivy League, with Brooks Brothers suits, gentleman Cs, and warbling society wives. . . . From immigrants and outcasts, street toughs and science wonks, nerds and boffins, the bearded and the beer-bellied, the tacky and uptight, and sometimes weird, the born again and born yesterday, with Adam's apples bobbing, psyches throbbing, and acne galore, the fraternity of the pizza breakfast, the Ferrari dream, the silicon truth, the midnight modem, and the seventy hour week . . . from the coarse fanaticism and desperation, ambition and hunger, genius and sweat of the outsider, the downtrodden, the banished and the bullied come most of the progress in the world and in Silicon Valley.&quot;    ---   Mr. Shaffer is founder of Technologic Partners and publisher of Technologic Computer Letter. </TEXT></DOC>
