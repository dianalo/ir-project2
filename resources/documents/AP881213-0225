She is among a growing number of Manila residents who have beguncarrying weapons as protection against what they see as a risingcrime rate in Manila.   Military officials estimate there are nearly 513,000 pistols,rifles and shotguns in civilian hands throughout the Philippines, anation of 58 million people, and that than 184,000 of those weaponsare unregistered.   Advertisements for imported firearms have begun appearing innewspapers and mass-circulation magazines.   Walden Carbonell, manager of the Walden-James Guns and HobbyShop, says business is booming. He said about 40 customers, most ofthem businessmen and professionals, come into his shop every day.   ``There are more criminals with guns nowadays,'' he told onecustomer. ``That's why you need a sophisticated weapon.''   The customer, lawyer Tomas Lahom, agreed.   ``I'm buying a semi-automatic shotgun, just for the home,'' hesaid.   ``There has been an increase in the number of individuals wantingto own firearms,'' said Col. Jose Andaya, chief of the PhilippineConstabulary's firearms and explosives unit. ``But this is normalbecause of our peace and order situation.''   Police report that in 1986, the most recent year for whichcomplete statistics are available, 21,914 crimes were reported inmetropolitan Manila. Of those, 14,281 were ``index crimes,'' such asmurder, rape, armed robbery and kidnapping.   The police say they have no later figures that would show whetherthe rate is rising or falling, but the general public perceives itas rising. President Corazon Aquino said in September law and orderwas breaking down and that preventing crime was a top governmentpriority.   According to a study by private security companies, 764 murderswere reported up to October this yar and only 299 have been solved.The study also said banks lost 55.3 million pesos ($2.7 million) innearly 50 armed holdups in that same period.   Fascination with firearms has been a traditional feature ofPhilippine life. But police acknowledge that the firearm fad isincreasing because of public fears about violent crime and lack ofconfidence in law enforcement.   ``There is a most compelling felt need among a growing number ofFilipinos to arm themselves,'' said the Philippine Daily Inquirernewspaper. ``The average Filipino does not have enough confidence inthe authorities to defend him from physical harm.''   Several Manila newspapers have decried the spread of firearmsamong the public, maintaining that the increase in weapons will onlymake the city more dangerous.   ``More firearms in the hands of civilians will not combatcriminality,'' said The Manila Chronicle. ``All government has to dois strictly enforce the ban on carrying of firearms by unauthorizedpersons.''   But in October, the Philippine Congress actually made it easierfor Filipinos without criminal records to obtain weapons. Itapproved a bill allowing individuals to own as many as two licensedfirearms and to carry one of them outside a residence.   Congress itself has imported weapons for the protection of itsmembers, and carloads of armed security guards trailing limousinesof congressmen, government officials or prosperous businessmen are acommon sight on Manila streets.   In 1986, Customs intercepted a cargo of firearms, includingIsraeli-made Uzi submachine guns, but released the shipment when itturned out the weapons were imported by the office of Vice PresidentSalvador Laurel.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Fri AMs, Dec. 16</NOTE></DOC>
