How about a crystal ruler etched with your company's name? A folding address book that fits inside a wallet? A ballpoint pen that displays six different messages when clicked?    Those are some of the hot new products in specialty advertising, the branch of the ad business that makes all those pencils, key rings and other freebies that companies give away to engender good will and repeat sales.    Though sometimes known as the matchbook medium, specialty advertising is a big business. All told, it racked up $4.1 billion in sales last year, a 5% gain over 1987, according to the Specialty Advertising Association in Irving, Texas. Wearables remain the biggest category, with nearly 19% of total sales. Writing instruments were a close second at 16.4%, followed by desk and other office accessories, at 11.9%.    A recent tour through the association's annual trade show in Chicago gives a glimpse of the latest developments in the medium. In general, according to participants, the trend in &quot;adcentives&quot; is from trash to class. But there were plenty of both types of merchandise in evidence.    &quot;We call them the T-shirt for the waist down,&quot; says Steve Danzig of Image Boxers, proudly displaying boxer shorts emblazoned with Merrill Lynch, Federal Express and Domino's Pizza logos. Because they're designed as billboards, and because women wear them as jogging shorts, &quot;we don't even put flies in them anymore,&quot; Mr. Danzig adds.    Socks, sweatbands and other practical fitness items are in fashion. Some buyers ask that their logos be silk-screened or sewn on both sides of headbands and wristbands, so the wearer can't hide them. But other customers prefer to be more discreet. A Sportsline sales rep noted that Westinghouse recently ordered several hundred pairs of walking socks with its name printed only on the instep.    Sports bags -- &quot;sausages&quot; to the trade -- are big movers. So are straps for bags, with company names woven into them. But restaurants, bars and labor unions prefer suspenders over straps for their customers, one salesman said.    Logo ties remain in style for all sorts of companies. For those who think putting their name all over a tie is gauche, though, Wolfmark Neckwear's Scott Goldstein has a suggestion. &quot;How about a nice silk tie with a label on the back that says 'Custom made for Continental Bank'?&quot;    Then there's signature candy. A New York firm, Chocolate Photos, used to put people's faces on milk-chocolate patties but now concentrates on advertising messages. One problem with edibles, of course, is that they seem antithetical to specialty advertising's moniker as &quot;the medium that remains to be seen.&quot;    Calendars, the perennial way to keep one's name in front of a customer, last year accounted for nearly 10% of all specialty ad sales. Now one manufacturer thinks it can keep an advertiser's message there in perpetuity. An executive-desk model calendar from Allen Co. features a ceramic tile date plate that fits in a wood base. At year end, the advertiser sends the client an updated tile. The initial set costs about $25, the tiles $4.    Long reliant on grocery stores and gas stations, calendar makers now are aiming at niche-market clients. &quot;Instead of kittens and puppies and scenery, we're into more specialized art,&quot; says a salesman for Advertising Unlimited Inc. To prepare a calendar for doctors, the Sleepy Eye, Minn., firm photographed antique instruments in a medical museum.    Shapes are another popular way to customize mementos. For pharmacists, the show had pocket calculators with keys that look like pill capsules; for the U.S. Postal Service, there were mailbox clocks.    Vendors also were busy taking orders for Christmas ornaments decorated with corporate logos. One salesman notes they make an ideal gift: they look more expensive than they are. They're also trendy collectibles. Prudential-Bache Securities dates those it annually sends clients. But, as with a lot of specialty advertising, the message can seem inappropriate for the item: one ornament was stamped &quot;Morton Salt Safety Program.&quot;    Indeed, taste is a concern for many in the industry. Ken Berlekamp, whose Fremont, Ohio, company makes those nametags that auto dealers put on their cars, urges dealers to be more conscious of aesthetics. Too often, he says, the signature plate is so tacky that the buyer &quot;can't wait to rip it off.&quot; Mr. Berlekamp recommends that dealers copy the lettering of the car's manufacturer.    &quot;This isn't a junkie business,&quot; says Sandy Lewis, a buyer from Milwaukee, who contends that &quot;even companies that sell something for 39 cents are looking for quality.&quot; To make sure they find it, she says buyers &quot;think of ourselves as counselors -- account executives -- not people trying to unload as many cheap key chains as we can.&quot;    ---   Ad Notes. . . .
