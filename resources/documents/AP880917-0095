At least 109 people have been killed and more than 800,000 lefthomeless since Gilbert ripped through the Caribbean with 175 mphwind earlier this week, then crossed the Yucatan Peninsula and Gulfof Mexico before slamming into northeastern Mexico. One person diedtoday in Texas after being injured in a tornado.   But by this morning, the once massive storm's maximum sustainedwinds had flagged to 65 mph, nine less than hurricane strength, andforecasters said the eye had all but disappeared. However, theywarned of continued danger from flash flooding inland.   Gilbert was downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 a.m. EDT as itproceeded 50 miles southeast of the city of Monterrey in northernMexico, said Noel Rishnychok, a meteorologist with the NationalHurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.   Winds were still weakening as the storm moved west-northwest at12 mph, he said.   Gulf Coast residents expressed relief that the storm, whichearlier was deemed the most powerful ever tracked in the WesternHemisphere, pulled its punch as it came ashore despite delivering aspate of tornadoes.   ``We're thankful,'' said Betty Turner, mayor of Corpus Christi.``What could have been one of the most deadly storms in historyappears to have missed us.''   Corpus Christi residents who evacuated were eager to return, butTurner said, ``We're saying don't do it because of the flooding.''   At least a dozen tornadoes peppered southern Texas today,following 14 on Friday, killing one woman, striking a hospitalcomplex, military bases and a mobile home park, authorities said.Some injuries were reported.   At 6 a.m. CDT, the center of the storm was in northern Mexiconear latitude 25.0 degrees north and longitude 99.8 west, or about150 miles southwest of Brownsville, located at the southernmost tipof Texas.   Gilbert's remnants should bring very heavy rains to Rio Grandevalley before heading north up the Mississippi River Valley as a``huge rain-making machine,'' said Mark Zimmer, meteorologist atthe National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.   ``The danger of flash flooding in Texas is very great,'' Zimmersaid. ``Rainfall as high as 10 to 15 inches _ maybe even 20 inches_ is expected.''   By midweek, the storm should be in the lower Ohio River Valleyand end up in the Great Lakes as nothing more than foul weather,forecasters said.   ``The people in the Midwest better dust off their umbrellas,''Zimmer said.   Gilbert, responsible for billions of dollars in damage during aweeklong rampage across the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, barreledashore Friday afternoon in Tamaulipas state, a sparsely populatedarea of Mexico about 120 miles south of Brownsville.   The eye passed over Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, two smallvillages a few miles north of La Pesca, Mexico, where ocean tidescoursed over two miles of flatlands and into the town.   ``We presume (the Mexican villages) are getting a good poundingfrom 120 mph winds,'' Zimmer said Friday.   Thousands of people evacuated in areas of northeastern Mexico,including the entire beach area of Matamoros, a city of 280,000just across the border.   To the south, about 300,000 people were homeless in Yucatanstate and 10,000 more were homeless in Campeche, on the west coastof the peninsula, the government news agency Notimex said. Thestorm had left more than 500,000 homeless in Jamaica earlier in theweek.   In Texas, heavy rains fell on Brownsville, with gusts up to 82mph recorded at nearby Padre Island, but the vulnerable coastalarea escaped the worst of the storm.   Police in nearby Harlingen said the windows of 20 to 30 cars ina parking lot were shattered by high winds or a tornado. Low-lyingcoastal roads were closed by high water.   About 125 shelters holding 50,000 people were open in afour-county area of southern Texas around Brownsville, saidAmerican Red Cross spokeswoman Barbara Lohman. When the eye of thestorm passed to the south, evacuees were eager to return to theirhomes.   ``We're going home. We think everything is going to be OK,''Philip Gibbons said Friday night, leaving a Brownsville shelterinto a downpour. ``We don't think it's going to get bad and therewas no need to stay here anymore.''   Others, however, were more cautious.   ``I wouldn't want to go home and then have my family hurt by atornado,'' said Praxedis Lindsey, 25, of Brownsville, who was at ashelter with his pregnant wife and son.   Elsewhere, most of the estimated 25,000 people evacuated insouthern Louisiana and 20,000 in the island city of Galveston wereallowed to return home Friday.   In Alabama, tornadoes were reported in seven counties, uprootingtrees but causing no major damage or injuries.   One Texas drowning was indirectly related to the hurricane. A3-year-old boy fell from his family's shrimp boat when they movedthe vessel for safe mooring, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
