(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Modern pioneers of bison genetics aretrying to bring back large numbers of the burly beasts as a sourceof low-cholesterol meat.   Using cattle as surrogate mothers, a Cheyenne-based group ofscientists and ranchers plans to breed bison as the animal of thefuture for an increasingly health-conscious society.   ``We see there is nowhere near the number of bison for thedemand,'' said Paul Butler, manager of the group, LivestockResearch and Innovation. ``In order to make any type of dramaticincrease you've got to use the new techniques.''   Bison were on the brink of extinction at the end of the lastcentury, when hide-hunters of the Great Slaughter reduced herds ofmillions to fewer than 300. Now bison are multiplying slowly,numbering 80,000 to 100,000, according to the Denver-based AmericanBuffalo Association.   The animals also are arousing appetites in the meat market.   ``Basically the meat's better,'' Butler said, referring topositive results in recent taste tests. ``It's got more protein andless fat, and yet it's tender and flavorful.''   LRI wants to capitalize by getting cattle to give birth to bisonand nurse the calves until they reach the age of slaughter. Withhelp from the University of Wyoming, researchers have beenartificially inseminating female bisons treated with hormones.Fertilized embryos are flushed out of the bisons and implanted incattle, allowing bison cows to produce more embryos without waitingto give birth themselves.   So far cows have rejected all implanted bison embryos, but theconfidence of embryo transfer experts and interest expressed by theWyoming Department of Agriculture have fueled optimism.   ``We've got to perfect the techniques,'' Butler said. ``Thereare certain adjustments we have to make when working with bisons.They are a big, strong, wild animal. They're not easy to handle.''   Colorado State University professor George Seidel, areproductive physiologist who pioneered embryo transfer techniqueswith horses, cows, sheep and rabbits, does not doubt the methodswill work with bison.   ``The technique is not too different from the test-tube baby,''Seidel said. ``I would expect it would work.''   Similarly, University of Wyoming Animal Science professor GaryMoss, who is guiding the LRI project, said he is sure it can bedone.   Butler has been talking with buyers in New Zealand andAustralia. Besides bison he envisions selling frozen bison embryosguaranteed to grow for about $10,000 each.   Not everyone is so enthusiastic.   Embryo transfer proponent David MacKenzie, a Lousiana Stateprofessor of plant pathology, cautioned, ``We've got to get smarterabout how we do this.''   And activist Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation onEconomic Trends, warned in an appearance in Wyoming that mixingbreeds in high-technology projects can lead to an undesirablehomogenization of species.   Nonetheless, a University of Wyoming marketing study suggestedfurther uses of the bison.   ``With bison, you can sell everything from the head to thetail,'' researchers wrote. ``Bison by-products include heads,robes, skulls, leather goods, wood and jewelry made from theirbones and horns.''   Bison ranchers are quick to point out the profit potential of anenterprise that could dramatically increase the number of thespecies.   ``There's an incredible market for it,'' said John Flocchini,who manages a herd of about 2,500 buffalo on the Durham Ranch nearGillette. ``I wish we had about five or six times the number ofanimals that we have.''   The Durham ranch sells bison meat in California, where Flocchinifound ``there's just way more demand than there is supply.''   Moreover, Flocchini and others believe few animals are moresuitable than bison for Wyoming, where harsh weather and predatorspose problems for cattle ranchers.   A recent study sponsored by the Canadian Wildlife Service foundthat bison use nutrients in poor feed grain more efficiently thancattle. The study concluded that ``bison ranching could be analternative to cattle in areas of poor forage and severe winters.''   Despite these bright economic prospects, Flocchini said he wouldbe reluctant to dive into bison genetics.   ``The way things are right now we're happy with the profitmargin that we are making,'' Flocchini said.   ``I have a hard time messing with Mother Nature. The buffalo isan animal that's already been too screwed up by humanintervention.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon PMs, Aug 15</NOTE></DOC>
