L. 99-570. Section 1360 of this Act (hereinafter the``statutory amendment'') makes several amendments to the CBCA that necessitatea revision of the FDIC's implementing regulations.Prior to the statutory amendment, the CBCA did not require notice to, orsolicitation of comments from, the public in connection with a change inbank control notice filed under the CBCA. The FDIC's regulation did, however,require persons seeking to acquire a bank to publish an announcement and,as part of that announcement, to solicit public comment on the proposedacquisition (see 12 CFR 303.4(b)(2)(i)).The statutory amendment provides that the appropriate federal banking agencyshall, within a reasonable period, publish notice of, and solicit commentson, a proposed acquisition. The FDIC believes that its pre-existing regulation,requiring acquiring persons to publish notice of, and solicit commentson, the proposed acquisition within specified time periods (generally within20 days of acceptance of the notice by the FDIC), satisfies the basic publicationrequirements of the statutory amendment. For this reason, the FDIC is notproposing to change the existing basic requirements for pubication or solicitationof comments regarding the proposed acquisition.The statutory amendment also provides that the FDIC may waive the requiredpublication and solicitation of comments only if the FDIC determines inwriting that such publication or solicitation would seriously threatenthe safety or soundness of the bank to be acquired. The FDIC's pre-existingregulation, however, provides that the FDIC may, in circumstances requiringprompt action and for good cause, (1) waive the publication requirement,(2) waive or shorten the public comment period, or (3) act on a proposedchange in control prior to the expiration of the public comment period.The FDIC is proposing to amend its regulation to bring it into conformancewith the statutory standard for waiver of the publication and comment solicitationrequirements. The proposed change would allow waiver of publication orcomment solicitation only if the FDIC determines in writing that publicationof comment solicitation would seriously threaten the safety or soundnessof the bank to be acquired. The FDIC is also proposing to apply this samestandard in determining whether to act on a proposed change in controlprior to the expiration of the public comment period. It is explicitlyrecognized that one situation in which publication or comment solicitationcould seriously threaten the safety or soundness of the bank to be acquiredis when the FDIC must act immediately in order to prevent the probablefailure of the bank to the acquired. In addition, the proposal providesthe FDIC with limited descretion to shorten the public comment period incircumstances not affecting the safety or soundness of the bank to be acquired.The proposal provides that the FDIC may shorten the public comment period,to not less than ten days, if there is good cause for such action; goodcause will exist only if FDIC determines that there are circumstances beyondthe control of the acquiring persons which warrant such action.Although the FDIC believes that the current time frames conform with thestatutory mandate to publish and solicit comment within a reasonable period,the FDIC is also considering amending the time period within which acquiringpersons must publish notice of a proposed acquisition. Paragraph (b)(2)(i)of the current regulation provides, in relevant part, that the acquiringpersons must publish notice of a proposed acquisition within ten days afterreceiving confirmation that the appropriate FDIC regional office has acceptedthe change in bank control notice filed under the CBCA, and such noticemust include the date of acceptance. The FDIC is considering amending thisprovision to permit publication of such a prior notice up to ten days priorto the filing of the change in bank control notice but no later than tendays after the notice is accepted by the appropriate FDIC regional office.It is contemplated that publication prior to acceptance of the notice wouldbe permitted only with the prior consent of the FDIC. Although the FDIChas not yet determined that it is appropriate to make such an amendment,the FDIC is interested in receiving comments on the question of whetherit would be appropriate to amend the time period in the above-noted manner.The FDIC is also proposing changes at andSection; 303.4(b)(5) (i) and (ii)which would apply to acquisitions which do not comply with the CBCA. Forinstance, this situation could occur when notice of an acquisition is filedsubsequent to the acquisition. Such notices do not technically fall withinthe CBCA since the CBCA speaks only of notices filed prior to acquisitionand in conformity with the CBCA. The proposed amendment would provide regulatoryguidance where the FDIC deems such publication and comment to be advisable.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The Board of Directors of the FDIC hereby certifies that the proposed amendmentswill not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small business entities within the meaning of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq</T3>). The proposed amendments do not impose any additionalregulatory burden on banks of any size. In light of the above-noted certification,the Regulatory Flexibility Act requirements (at 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604) toprepare initial and final regulatory flexibility analyses do not applyto the proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 303</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Authority delegations, Bank depositinsurance, Banks, Banking, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.For the reasons stated in this notice, and pursuant to the FDIC's authorityunder section 13 of the Change in Bank Control Act (12 U.S.C. 1817(j)(13)),the FDIC proposes to amend 12 CFR Part 303 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 303_APPLICATIONS, REQUESTS, SUBMITTALS, DELEGATIONS OF AUTHORITY,AND NOTICES OF ACQUISITION OF CONTROL</ITAG>1.
