Two out of four regional express train lines were paralyzed by amaintenance workers' strike called by the communist-led GeneralConfederation of Labor.   City buses and the Metro also have had disruptions, but mostMetro lines were running normally and the transit agency reportedbuses running at about 60 percent of normal.   Beginning about 6:30 a.m., more than 200 military vehicles hitthe road, each crammed with up to 25 people struggling to get towork on the cold, rainy morning.   ``It's original, it's practical and it works, which is more thanI can say for the express trains,'' said Erik Saliou, a financialadviser from Nanterre, west of the capital, who arrived in one ofthe soggy green transport trucks at the La Defense complex inwestern Paris.   ``It has been enormously difficult getting to work,'' he said.``Tonight I'll take a bus if I can find one, or this truck if I canfind it. I'll take what I can get.''   The trucks, brought in from eastern France and from French basesin West Germany along with a thousand soldiers, carried only afraction of the 600,000 people who normally commute on the expresstrains. More military vehicles were en route to Paris.   Officials said several hundred private buses were also beingchartered to replace the trains.   Many people opted to drive, causing huge traffic jams. Commutersarriving in trucks at the Porte d'Orleans at the southern edge ofParis said it took 90 minutes on clogged highways for what isnormally a 30-minute ride on the train.   At the Porte de Vincennes in eastern Paris, soldiers who workedthe morning rush hour reported a cheerful atmosphere. Soldiers at LaDefense said the same.   ``People were very nice. They were just happy to get here,'' saidSgt. T.H. Lagniel, of the 135th transport regiment in Karlsruhe,West Germany. ``For us, this gives us contact we wouldn't ordinarilyhave with the civilian population.''   Not everyone viewed the unusual commute in a positive light.   ``I feel like a victim,'' said computer operator HouriaBendahmane after a two-hour ride on a cold metal bench from awestern suburb.   Ms. Bendahmane climbed out of the truck, holding down her shortskirt with one hand and a supporting bar with the other whilesetting a high-heeled foot gingerly on a stool held by a younglieutenant. She was followed out of the truck by an elderly womanwearing sneakers and carrying dress shoes and a banker in a navy,cashmere coat, who climbed down and rushed away.   ``We were well-assisted, but frankly it was not too comfortable.It was cold and windy and wet. It was noisy,'' Ms. Bendahmane said.   Michel Rousselot, head of the Paris Autonomous Transit Agency,said after 14 hours of meetings with representatives of the laborfederation and six other unions the agency was sticking to thesalary offers rejected by the unions. He said no end to the strikewas in sight.   The federation, the dominant union at the transit agency, isdemanding increased safety measures and across-the-board payincreases of about $170 per month.   The transit agency has offered immediate monthly raises of about$25 plus bonuses ranging from about $17 to $100. For next year, theagency is offering an increase of 2.2 percent. The current averagemonthly salary is about $1,100.   After the meeting, the labor federation and a smaller union, theFrench Democratic Confederation of Labor, both called for the striketo continue, while the other unions said they would consult theirmembers.   President Francois Mitterrand said Tuesday the government actedwisely in calling out the army, rather than give in to ``a smallnumber of persons, cabable of blocking an entire system.''   The opposition conservatives in the National Assembly introduceda censure motion condemning the social policies of Socialist PremierMichel Rocard.   In recent weeks, nurses, postal employees, government officeworkers and other public service staff have staged strikes, allseeking wage increases higher than those called for in Rocard'spolicy of economic ``rigor.''   Jacques Malladur, a taxi driver waiting to pick up commuters atLa Defense, blamed the unionized civil servants for the deadlock inthe strike.   ``They can go on forever with no risk of losing their jobs,'' hesaid, referring to the protection from lay-offs enjoyed by publicsector workers.   ``This is a military action,'' he said. ``But then, this is war.''</TEXT></DOC>
