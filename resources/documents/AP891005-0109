(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The first Americanrocket built and designed entirely with commercial funds fizzledand burned on the launch pad today, the project's backers said.   ``We lighted it up and for one reason or the other it didn'tlift off,'' said Jim Bennett, president of American Rocket Co. ofCamarillo. The launch team tried to disengage the rocket, but itcaught fire, he said.   The 58-foot rocket used in the $2 million experimental launchwas to have flown on a 15-minute suborbital flight to test StarWars missile detectors and a heat shield-parachute that might helpastronauts escape a space station emergency.   ``There was fire on the pad which is now close to burning itselfout,'' Bennett said. The Air Force said there was minimal damage tothe launch pad, which belongs to the Air Force, but ``the vehicleis non-flyable.''   The 33,400-pound rocket is powered by a hybrid engine that runson a combination of liquid oxygen and a rubberlike solid fuel.   American Rocket said its booster was the first designed andbuilt only with commercial funds. Rockets in other commerciallaunches this year were built under government programs but latersold for commercial use, according to the company.   Today's launch was scheduled so the rocket could release a cloudof inert gas as the Pentagon's Delta Star satellite passedoverhead. The satellite contains sensors that someday may be partof a Strategic Defense Initiative system in which satellites woulddetect incoming warheads so they could be destroyed.   Defense Department spokesman Maj. William O'Connell said earlierthat the Pentagon would not reveal whether the sensors detected thebooster.   The rocket also was scheduled to deploy a test model of an8{-foot-wide ParaShield _ a combined heat shield and parachute thatsomeday might be part of an escape system to allow space stationastronauts to return to Earth.   David Akin, assistant professor of aeronautics and astronauticsat the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had his design classbuild the 390-pound model.</TEXT></DOC>
