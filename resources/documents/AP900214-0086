Brooklyn Criminal Judge Albert Koch on Tuesday found Sharptonand two other black activists guilty of obstruction of governmentaladministration, criminal trespass and disorderly conduct. Heordered them jailed immediately for 45 days. The three had faced upto six months in jail.   ``Crack dealers will walk out of this courthouse today; muggersand robbers will walk out of this building today, and we will go tojail,'' Sharpton told the judge after the sentencing. ``Just giveme a glass of water each day.''   Later Tuesday Sharpton's lawyer, Alton Maddox, obtained a stayof his client's sentence from the Appellate Division pendingappeal, said Patrick Clark, spokesman for the Brooklyn districtattorney's office.   Sharpton, the Rev. Timothy Mitchell and Charles Barron were heldin protective custody in the hospital at the Rikers Island jailuntil their release early today, said Ruby Ryles, a spokeswoman forthe city Correction Department.   The charges stem from the Dec. 21, 1987, ``Day of Outrage''protest against racism in the city.   Sharpton and more than 70 others were arrested when theydisrupted subway service in Brooklyn during the evening rush hourby jumping on tracks, pulling emergency cords and holding subwaydoors open. Charges were dropped against most participants.   Sharpton faces similar charges for a 1988 protest whendemonstrators blocked traffic on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.</TEXT></DOC>
