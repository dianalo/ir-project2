But the Reagan administration is concerned that global tradetalks could be dealt a severe setback if the next president doesn'tmake the negotiations a top priority.   The United States and 95 other countries have been holding talkssince late 1986 on ways to improve the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade, the global compact which governs trade.   These talks were in the headlines last week at the Torontoeconomic summit when President Reagan repeated his call for a totalelimination of all agricultural subsidies by the year 2000. Theother nations refused to endorse the idea, opting instead for acall to reduce subsidies, which now annually total $200 billionworldwide.   But the world's largest industrial powers, the United States,Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada, did adoptstrong language urging their trade ministers to make progress inthe current global trade talks, known as the Uruguay round becausethey were launched in that country at a conference in late 1986.   ``As the Uruguay round enters a more difficult phase, it isvital to ensure the momentum of these ambitious negotiations,'' thesummit nations declared. ``The greatest possible advance must bemade in all areas.''   Negotiators for the biggest trading markets, the United States,Japan, Canada and the 12-country European Economic Community, metafter the Toronto summit for an additional two days at a lakeresort in Brainerd, Minn. Officials there said they were encouragedby progress made in narrowing other differences.   An American official, who spoke on condition that his name notbe used, said negotiators were close to reaching agreement ontougher rules to protect patents, copyrights and trademarks, areaswhere international piracy has cost U.S. businesses more than $46billion.   The United States is also pushing for rules to govern trade inservices, such as telecommunications and insurance, and globalinvestment, two areas where the United States has a competitiveedge. Neither category is now covered by global trading rules.   Officials said progress had been made in finding ways toincrease the free flow of investment between countries, but theyreported less success in trying to write rules governing trade inservices, primarily because of a dispute over just which of 150services categories should be covered.   Trade officials were more hopeful that a session scheduled forMontreal in December would bring agreement on ways to strengthenthe Geneva-based GATT's procedures for settling trade disputesbetween nations by speeding up a process that can now drag on for adecade or more.   U.S. officials said they believed a new streamlined disputemechanism would receive approval in Montreal and begin operating bynext year.   Likewise, U.S. negotiators expressed confidence that reforms inthe operation of the GATT would also be adopted, at least on aninterim basis. The United States is proposing establishment of a12- or 14-member steering committee representing both industrialand Third World countries. It would set trade policy between themeetings of all 96 nations which belong to GATT.   After the Minnesota negotiating session, U.S. TradeRepresentative Clayton Yeutter said he was more hopeful thatsignificant progress can be made at the Montreal session, which iscoming at the midpoint of the scheduled four-year Uruguay round oftalks.   ``We have narrowed the differences and achieved consensus inquite a number of areas,'' he said.   But on agriculture, U.S. negotiators remained far apart fromofficials of Western Europe and Japan, who believe Reagan's callfor a total elimination of all subsidies by the end of the centuryis politically unrealistic.   Officials of other countries also expressed concern about howmuch authority U.S. negotiators will have in Montreal to speak forthe next administration, which will not take office until Jan. 20.   Yeutter said the administration will brief trade advisers forthe Republican and Democratic presidential candidates to keep theminformed on the progress of the negotiations. He said he did notexpect major changes in the U.S. negotiating position regardless ofwho is elected.</TEXT></DOC>
