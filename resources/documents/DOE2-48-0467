This paper presents someinvariant solutions on the subject, including a self-similar solutionfor the axisymmetric case, a self-similar solution in a linear, isoclinalreservoir that considers the effects of gravity and capillary forcessimultaneously, and a progressive wave solution corresponding to a stabilizedzone of saturation distribution. The relations and differences among(1) a model that completely includes capillary effect, (2) a model thatconsiders capillary action partially and implicitly (the Buckley-Leverettmodel), and (3) a model that completely ignores capillary effect areindicated and discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
