Some people consider it nothing but bad French.    In this battle, an 86-year-old retired Catholic priest, Msgr. Jules O. Daigle, himself a Cajun, has become an unlikely folk hero. &quot;To call Cajun bad French,&quot; he fumes, &quot;is to call French and Italian bad Latin.&quot;    With $30,000 of his own money and little academic support, Father Daigle last year published a 600-page dictionary of Cajun. It is the first large-scale work on what for 225 years was solely a spoken language. The language's right to respectability may remain debatable, but there is no doubting its colorfulness.    When exiled French-speaking Acadians began arriving in the backwaters of southern Louisiana around 1760, they were poor but imaginative. When they encountered a white sunfish unknown in their former Canadian home, the image of the fish flopping from the water provided the name. In most places, the fish is a crappie, but to the Cajuns -- short for Acadians -- it is a &quot;sac-a-lait,&quot; or bag of milk.    In France, the word for frog is &quot;grenouille,&quot; but the Cajuns borrowed an Indian term and Gallicized it into &quot;ouaouaron,&quot; pronounced waw-wah-RHAWN, a fair approximation of a bullfrog's croaking across the marsh. Popcorn became what it sounded like when cooking in the pot: &quot;tac-tac.&quot;    &quot;Raccoon&quot; poses something of a linguistic mystery. One Cajun version is &quot;chaoui,&quot; pronounced shah-WEE. This word, too, is thought to be of Indian origin, but Father Daigle suggests another possibility. &quot;There were no raccoons where the Cajuns came from,&quot; he says, &quot;so I imagine a couple of Cajuns looking up into a tree and seeing this strange animal that looks like a cat. One looks at the other and says, &quot;Un chat, oui?&quot; -- &quot;A cat, yes?&quot;    Father Daigle's &quot;Dictionary of the Cajun Language&quot; constitutes a broadside at those who have derided his native tongue as a sort of country-bumpkin patois or crude &quot;Frenglish&quot; not worthy of speaking, much less preserving. Already the book has had three printings, selling 13,000 copies at $20 each.    Next year Father Daigle plans to publish a supplement, in part a grammar, in part an expansion of vocabulary terms. He says it will strengthen his claim that Cajun, while owing its roots to French, is neither a dialect nor &quot;broken French&quot; but a unique American language created &quot;in Louisiana by Louisianians.&quot;    The dictionary has put Father Daigle squarely in the middle of a bubbling &quot;galimachas&quot; (pronounced golly-mah-CHAH), a Cajunism for mess or turmoil. There is much discord over just what Cajun is and whether it can or should be taught in public schools in the 23 southern Louisiana parishes (counties) that make up the state's Cajun belt.    A state-financed agency, the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana, galled many Cajuns by spending millions of dollars on an elementary-school-French program that largely used Parisian teachers who often ridiculed Cajun in their classrooms. Though the agency has recently attempted to incorporate some Cajun instruction in the program, it wasn't so long ago that its leadership asserted that to teach Cajun was to spread illiteracy.    Even many Louisiana linguists who are sympathetic to the Cajun revival complain that Father Daigle's dictionary overstates the case for Cajun as a separate language. Cajun more accurately, they say, can be divided into two major regional dialects, known as bayou Cajun and prairie Cajun, plus a jambalaya of subregional dialects.    &quot;So the question is not whether you can write down Cajun French as Father Daigle has done but what Cajun French do you write down?&quot; says Nolan LeCompte, the dean of the college of arts and sciences at Nicholls State University, who has done a great deal of research on the language.    Father Daigle contends that all Cajuns speak enough alike as to render regional and subregional differences insignificant.    In any case, Mr. LeCompte praises Father Daigle, likening his feat to Samuel Johnson's compiling the first respectable English dictionary in 1755. &quot;He got it down on paper,&quot; Mr. LeCompte says, &quot;and at least it's a start.&quot;    Father Daigle's effort seems all the more remarkable considering what happened in 1913: Louisiana's Anglo-dominated government officially banished all French from the state's schoolyards in an effort to &quot;mainstream&quot; the Cajuns. The Cajun language went into a rapid decline, notes Carl Brasseaux, assistant director of the Center for Louisiana Studies at the University of Southwestern Louisiana (USL) in Lafayette.    For a generation of Cajun children who faced punishment at school for speaking the language of their homes, Cajun would become a social stigma associated with backwater ways and ignorance. As adults, most of them simply declined to pass the language on to their children, so that by 1950, Mr. Brasseaux says, it seemed headed for oblivion.    Today there are probably about 900,000 south Louisianians of Cajun ancestry, and perhaps half of them still speak Cajun. But the number under 25 years old who speak it is minuscule, a trend some think irreversible.    Efforts now are being made to teach Cajun in Louisiana. USL offers a course built on standard French constructions, and some school districts have tried sporadically to at least &quot;Louisianify&quot; the French they offer to students. But such efforts have been stymied lately. Money for instruction and research has been cut because of the state's depressed oil economy.    There is also that problem of definition. Just what is the Cajun language?    First, it is a blend of at least three kinds of French: the French spoken by those who migrated from France to French-controlled Acadia (now Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island) in the early 1600s; the French that evolved during 150 years of life there; and the French developed south and west of New Orleans after the British in 1755 brutally expelled the Acadians who wouldn't swear allegiance to Britain.    When, over the years, their French didn't provide terms for some of the realities of their new Louisiana world, the Cajuns simply borrowed. &quot;Bayou&quot; is an Indian term. &quot;Gumbo&quot; came from blacks who still maintained snippets of their African dialect. English contributed &quot;pipeline&quot; (pronounced peep-LEEN) and car (pronounced char) and a host of other terms.    The Cajuns also showed a fondness for English grammar, tossing out most of the irregular verbs of standard French. And they settled, as English has done, on a single word for &quot;you,&quot; the informal &quot;tu.&quot;    There are other complications. Owing largely to settlement patterns and natural barriers such as bayous and swamps, Cajun splintered into numerous dialects. Father Daigle's dictionary, say Nicholls's Mr. LeCompte and other students of Cajun, mainly chronicles the French of the Cajun prairie, the rice-farming flatlands that include the monsignor's home town of Welsh and the oil-drilling hub of Lafayette.    But in the Cajun bayous, typified by the southeastern Louisiana towns of Houma and Thibodaux, the Acadians interspersed themselves among large numbers of so-called Creoles. These immigrants had come directly from France, and their French was closer to the standard French of the time.    Modern bayou Cajun, then, is a blend of Acadian and standard French. Separated from prairie Cajun by the imposing swamps of the Atchafalaya Basin, it tended to develop its own idiosyncrasies. So did the language in some communities within these larger regions.    Thus, while &quot;Qu'est qu'il y a?&quot; is a fairly common way of posing the question &quot;What's the matter?&quot; Cajun French has at least seven other ways of asking the same question, depending upon the town or region of the speaker, says Richard Guidry, a language specialist with the state's education department.    Similarly, there are some confusing differences in terms, Mr. Guidry adds. The word &quot;gallette (pronounced gah-YET), for instance, in most of Cajun country means a cookie or cake. But in some Cajun subregions, says Mr. Guidry, it has a rather specific sexual meaning.    &quot;Thus, my grandfather knows that my grandmother bakes a good gallette,&quot; he says, &quot;but if she went to the town of Ville Platte offering to sell it, he would become very upset.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
