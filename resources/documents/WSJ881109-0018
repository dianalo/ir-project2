Now the real political struggle begins.    George Bush takes over as president in 73 days. Between now and then, he must form his senior management team to run the equivalent of the largest, most powerful corporation in the world.    &quot;Everybody wants to jockey, connive and scheme for these government jobs,&quot; observes Pendleton James, who says he still bears the scars from running President Reagan's transition personnel search in 1980. Jack Watson, who guided President Carter's transition effort, once confessed that &quot;it was two months into the transition before I felt safe in starting my car.&quot;    These organizational decisions will be made under the worst of circumstances: with the multiple handicaps of little time, post-campaign exhaustion and political debts to be paid. Yet the stakes are high. The cabinet and the most important 100 sub-cabinet appointments, which will be determined in the next 10 weeks, will &quot;ultimately determine the fate&quot; of the Bush presidency, concludes Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution.    While the president establishes broad policy mandates, these deputies are the people who will make &quot;the incremental decisions day by day that shape whether his administration is going to be a success or not,&quot; says Mr. Hess, whose book, &quot;Organizing the Presidency,&quot; examines the transition process. In all, Mr. Bush has the power to appoint about 3,000 people out of a federal civilian work force of approximately two million, Mr. Hess estimates.    Many presidents are frustrated with the hazards of this process.&quot;I must make the appointments now. A year hence I will know who I really want to appoint,&quot; President Kennedy complained to John Kenneth Galbraith during his own transition.    President Nixon, just two years after he put his first cabinet together, asked his staff, &quot;Where did we get these people? Where did these guys come from?&quot; Mr. James recounts. Mr. Nixon was referring to his transportation secretary, John Volpe, &quot;who wasn't marching in step, and he had George Romney as secretary of housing, who was marching to his own tune, and he had Wally Hickel as secretary of interior, who was marching with the war protesters,&quot; Mr. James recalls.    Handing out the new administration's plum jobs used to be a ritual performed in smoke-filled back rooms by a handful of the candidate's cronies. But the presidential transition process, after much scholarly attention, has now spawned a bureaucracy of its own. Since 1963, Congress has set aside federal funds to smooth the transition; this year, the president-elect has a budget of $3.5 million for the 73-day process. Within days, an entire three-story building in downtown Washington will be filled with as many as 500 staffers working on the transition from the old administration to the new one.    The Carter-Reagan transition was handicapped in 1980 by the idea that it was politically embarrassing for a candidate to admit he was planning his administration before he actually was elected; the transition chief had to keep a low profile, and that hampered his ability to ask the right questions.    That's why, Mr. James says, it wasn't until election night that he discovered the new 1978 Ethics in Government Act, requiring appointees' extensive financial disclosures and arrangements to eliminate possible conflicts of interest. As Mr. Reagan was declared the president-elect, the transition lawyer, Fred Fielding, &quot;passed me an envelope and said, 'Here's a briefing paper,'&quot; Mr. James recalls.    As resumes piled up around their desks, this year's transition managers have been poring over the lists of jobs available for political appointments, helped by a new guide to the most influential 116 jobs. It's the &quot;The Prune Book&quot; -- a list of the &quot;plum&quot; jobs that actually are important -- published by the nonpartisan Center for Excellence in Government. These critical jobs don't always have glamorous titles. They range from &quot;assistant secretary of the Navy for shipbuilding and logistics&quot; to &quot;deputy assistant secretary for multifamily housing.&quot;    The secret of success in any presidential transition, according to the experts, is getting started as early as possible. &quot;Once the election hits, the thunderstorms roll and you have to go operational,&quot; cautions Mr. James. Scores of public-policy groups are expected to flood the transition office with their suggestions for personnel and policy initiatives, as the Heritage Foundation did effectively in the early days of the first Reagan administration.    Some transition teams have gone to extreme lengths to broaden the talent search. Mr. Hess recounts in his book how Nixon aides tried to expand the process by sending form letters to everyone listed in Who's Who, including, accidentally, Richard Nixon. The effort &quot;resulted mostly in a lot of unanswered letters,&quot; Mr. Hess found.    The problem is more likely to be an embarrassment of riches -- too many applicants, whether qualified or not, for too few ambassadorial, regulatory, agency, White House and other jobs.    The campaign staffers and the transition planners are &quot;going to go out and kick the heck out of one another. They do it in any administration,&quot; Mr. James says. &quot;All the people in the campaign feel they're owed jobs. But the type of people working in a campaign are not necessarily the type of people you're going to appoint assistant secretary for international affairs.&quot;    Once these appointments are made, they're hard to undo. Mr. Hess concludes: &quot;It's like doing crossword puzzles in ink.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
