Supercomputer research at MSIis carried out using the three supercomputers at the Minnesota SupercomputerCenter, which is a short walk or campus-bus ride from the heart of theMinneapolis campus. The supercomputers include a two-pipe, 8-megawordControl Data Corporation CYBER 205 with a VSOS virtual memory operatingsystem, a one-processor, 16-megaword CRAY-2 with UNICOS UNIX operatingsystem, and a four-processor, 256-megaword CRAY-2 also running UNICOS.The authors describe here a selection of the research projects carriedout using these machines by researchers from the Departments of Chemistry,Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, and Medicinal Chemistry.</TEXT></DOC>
