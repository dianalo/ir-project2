A summit meeting of the six Front-line States in directconfrontation with South Africa called for U.N. Secretary-GeneralJavier Perez de Cuellar to hasten independence in South-West Africa,also known as Namibia, and ensure the machinery for independenceremains under the control of the world body.   The leaders of Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia andZimbabwe also appealed to the international community for militaryand other support during Namibia's U.N.-supervised transition toindependence.   It was the first Front-line summit since Angola, Cuba and SouthAfrica signed a U.S.-negotiated peace accord.   Under the agreement, signed Thursday in New York, South Africawill grant independence to mineral-rich Namibia while Cuba withdraws50,000 troops from Angola within 27 months.   Opening the summit, Kaunda called on President-elect George Bushto help the peace process by halting support to Jonas Savimbi'sNational Union for the Total Independence of Angola.   Savimbi's rebels have been fighting Angola's Marxist governmentsince the country gained independence from Portugal in 1975. Theguerrillas orginally were backed by South Africa, which for 73 yearshas governed Angola's southern neighbor, Namibia. But in recentyears they also have won support from Washington.   Neither Savimbi's movement nor guerrillas of the South-WestAfrica People's Organization fighting for Namibian independence wereinvolved directly in the peace accord.   However, Namibian guerrilla leader Sam Nujoma said on the eve ofthe summit that he hoped this Christmas would be the last underSouth African occupation for Namibia's 1 million people.   At the summit, Kaunda praised the Reagan administration formediating months of fractured talks that finally resulted in theaccord. But he echoed black leaders' fears that South Africa willrenege.   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, whose nation stands togain most from the pact, was more optimistic. He declared Sunday hewas happy with the terms and predicted southern Africa would be``transformed in the near future into a zone of peace andinternational cooperation.''   Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe havebeen at the forefront of African efforts to end Pretoria's policy oflegal race separation and speed Namibian independence.   Also at the summit are the three main guerrilla-backed politicalmovements fighting in southern Africa _ Nujoma's organization, andthe African National Congress and the Pan-Africanist Congress ofSouth Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
