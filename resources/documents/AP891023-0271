Earlier Monday, Tom Baker, president of District Lodge 751 ofthe International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,said the strike could not be settled without a bigger money offer.   The separate news conferences, including the first by Shrontz inthe dispute, appeared to mark a hardening of positions in the 20thday of a walkout at the world's largest commercial airplanemanufacturer.   Four hours of talks Wednesday were the first since union membersvoted by an 85 percent margin to strike rather than accept thecompany's a three-year offer.   That offer included annual pay increases of 4 percent, 3 percentand 3 percent; bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first yearand 3 percent in the second; cost-of-living increases to coverinflation; a 20 percent reduction in mandatory overtime; and higherbenefits.   No further talks were scheduled. The Machinists represent 57,800Boeing workers nationwide, including 43,300 in the local district,12,000 in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and a few hundredat scattered sites in other states.   At Wichita, a non-union Boeing worker and two others werereleased on bond after being arrested early Saturday in the firingof a shotgun at the union's strike headquarters. Pellets hit thebuilding, parked cars and a sign, but no one was injured. SedgwickCounty sheriff's deputies said charges could be filed within 14days.   Picketing has been generally quiet in the Seattle area.   The last paychecks for work done before the walkout were mailedby Boeing last week. The first union strike payments of a flat $100per week per member are set for distribution Thursday.   Baker said union members were adamant about getting a biggerfinancial package, with less than 1 percent crossing picket linesand fewer total crossing than in the last Boeing strike, in 1977.   At his news conference, Shrontz maintained the package was thebest in recent U.S. industrial history and said any boost wouldjeopardize Boeing's competitive position.   ``We're not prepared to increase the offer,'' Shrontz said.   Shrontz said he hoped the dispute would not jeopardize Boeing'slong-term labor relations, generally regarded as among the best inthe aerospace industry.   ``I don't think I've drawn a line that is unreasonable,'' hesaid.   Contacted by telephone after Shrontz spoke, Baker said he didn'tconsider that the company's last word.   ``They have their own timing on when they want to settle thestrike,'' the union leader said, adding that he did not know whatthat timetable might be.   Shrontz said Boeing already faced unspecified losses, includingsales, on which he gave no figures or other indication of magnitude.   ``We certainly are not ignoring this strike. We certainly wantto see it settled as soon as possible,'' Shrontz said. ``I thinkour losses are irreparable already.''   Meanwhile, contract talks with Boeing's second-largest union,the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Association, wereset to resume Tuesday and continue through the week, said RobbiMiner of the unaffiliated union.</TEXT></DOC>
