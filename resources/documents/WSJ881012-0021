The case raises the important question of whether it is an unconstitutional prior restraint on publication for a state law to impose criminal and civil liability on the news media for printing truthful information obtained through legal means.    The high court agreed to hear an appeal by the Florida Star, a small weekly newspaper serving the black community in Jacksonville, Fla.    In December 1985, a Florida state court jury issued a verdict against the newspaper, awarding $72,500 in compensatory damages and $25,000 in punitive damages to a Jacksonville woman who was raped in 1983. The woman's name had been included in a police report given to reporters by the local sheriff, and the Florida Star published the name, although Star reporters and editors said this was inadvertent.    Florida law makes it a crime to publish the name of the victim of a sex crime. But the newspaper wasn't prosecuted on criminal charges. Instead, the damages were awarded in a civil suit filed by the rape victim. The case relied almost entirely on the newspaper's violation of the criminal law, without offering additional proof that the actions were an invasion of privacy.    A Florida appeals court upheld the jury verdict.    George Rahdert, a St. Petersburg attorney for the Florida Star, says the $97,500 damage award &quot;would put the paper out of business&quot; if it is upheld.    The case is similar to a 1975 decision in which the Supreme Court ruled that Georgia couldn't impose liability on a local television station that aired the name of a rape victim that the broadcasters obtained from public court documents.    One difference between the two is that in the Florida case, the appeals court treated the name of the rape victim as &quot;private,&quot; rather than coming from public records.    Similar issues have arisen in other contexts. The Los Angeles Times has asked the Supreme Court to review a California court's ruling allowing an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit by a witness to a murder who was identified by name in a news story as having discovered the victim's body. The appeal is still pending. (Florida Star vs. B.J.F.)    Smokestack Rules   The justices let stand a court ruling ordering the Environmental Protection Agency to rewrite smokestack-emission rules for some utilities. The high court refused to hear an appeal by about 65 utility companies, led by Southern Co.'s Alabama Power Co. unit, the United Mine Workers and the National Coal Association.    Last January, a federal appeals court here ruled that the EPA failed to justify a portion of its smokestack-emission rules for coal-fired utilities, some oil-fired plants, certain smelters and paper mills. The rules allow companies to meet air-pollution standards in part by using tall smokestacks that disperse emissions. (Alabama Power Co. vs. Thomas; Ohio Power Co. vs. Thomas; National Coal Association vs. Thomas)   Other Actions   In other actions yesterday, the justices:   --Refused, in a case involving a $234,000 settlement of false defense-contract claims by General Electric Co., to decide whether federal appeals courts may review judges' decisions rejecting settlements. The federal appeals court in Cincinnati ruled that the rejection of GE's settlement with the government wasn't appealable. (General Electric Co. vs. U.S.)    -- Rejected Crocker National Bank's challenge to the constitutionality of a San Francisco law that requires office builders to pay a fee of $5 a square foot to subsidize mass-transit programs. The state courts upheld the fee, which was imposed in 1981. (Crocker National Bank vs. San Francisco)   -- Declined to consider an appeal by Fairness in Media, a longstanding critic of CBS Inc., challenging the manner in which Laurence Tisch became chief executive officer of CBS in 1986. (Fairness in Media vs. Federal Communications Commission)   -- Let stand a ruling by a federal appeals court in San Francisco reinstating an age-discrimination suit against Boeing Co., which was filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1984 to challenge the company's requirement that its pilots retire at age 60. A federal judge dismissed the suit before trial. (Boeing Co. vs. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission)   --Let stand the conviction of George Fahmy, a former securities broker with PaineWebber Inc., for evading federal law that requires that cash deposits of more than $10,000 be reported on a currency-transaction report. He was sentenced in 1987 to five years' probation and to perform 100 hours of community service. (Fahmy vs. U.S.) </TEXT></DOC>
