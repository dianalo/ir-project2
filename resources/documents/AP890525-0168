TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ariel Sharon, Israel's most charismatic andprovocative politician, is leading a right-wing revolt againstPrime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's peace plan and the government'sfailure to put down the Palestinian uprising.   ``We are very late. We wasted 18 months. But I think that thefirst thing the Israeli government should deal with now is how torestore law and order,'' said Sharon, the former defense ministerwho was the architect of Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982.   Slamming Shamir's proposal to hold elections in the occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip, Sharon added that the perpetrators ofterror and violence would first have to be dead,deported or behindbars.   His message sparked applause and cries of ``Arik for defenseminister!'' from the nearly 100 Likud bloc central committeemembers, members of Parliament and ex-army pals who crowded intothe living room of Sharon's heavily guarded apartment in the Moslemquarter of the walled Old City.   Sharon, the trade and industry minister, is holding a series ofmeetings before a showdown with Shamir on the peace plan at ameeting of the 3,000-member Likud central committee, tentativelyset for mid-June.   Sharon's seven-point counterplan calls for the governnment togive first priority to ending the intefadeh, or uprising, which hasclaimed nearly 500 Palestinian and 22 Israeli lives.   It also demand Jerusalem be excluded from any peace negotiationsand the 130 Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gazaofficially be made part of Israeli territory.   Shamir, 73, has threatened to resign if he doesn't winendorsement for his peace strategy.   It is uncertain if Sharon will succeed in galvanizing right-wingsupport. But Israeli anger has been on the rise, evidenced by an``anti-fada'' of Israeli stone-throwing attacks on Arab motoristsand vigilante raids by settlers on Arab villages.   The rotund, white-haired Sharon listened, occasionally jottingnotes on the palm or back of his left hand, as supporters in hisliving room aired their frustrations over the army's inability tostop the uprising.   One man said the uprising could have been stopped with singlemachine gun if the army had killed 20 Palestinians after the firstriot broke out in December 1987. A man in a wheelchair said anyPalestinian who threw a stone should have his house torn down andmore serious offenders should be expelled.   Yehoshua Saguy, former head of military intelligence and Likudmember of parliament, told the audience ``whoever doesn't act todaywill have to act tomorrow because anarchy is taking over in thestreets.''   Shamir, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron,the chief of staff, were attacked for being too soft on rioters.   To many, Sharon is seen as the only Israeli leader who has thedaring to shrug off world criticism and get the job done.   He is remembered as the can-do general who crushed a Palestinianinsurgency in Gaza in 1970 and the hero who ended the 1973Arab-Israeli war with a daring strike across the Suez Canal thatencircled Egypt's Third Army.   A survey of 1,206 Israelis by the independent Modiin Ezrachiagency indicated Israelis believed he could do a better job endingthe uprising, than anyone else. For example, he got 44.4 percentbacking to 20.5 percent for Rabin, whose job it is to put down therevolt. The remaining percentage was scattered.   Sharon's critics, however, note his military record was blottedby acts of harshness such as the reprisal raid on the Jordaniantown of Qibia in 1953 when his Unit 101 commandos blew up a row ofhouses killing 69 men, women and children. Sharon contended he wasunaware the houses were occupied.   Sharon was also forced to resign the defense minister's post in1983 after a judicial commission found he was indirectlyresponsible for the Sabra and Chatilla massacre of at least 800Palestinians in Beirut. It said he failed to forsee the danger ofallowing Christian militiamen into the camps.   Sharon, 61, with characteristic self-confidence, said in aninterview he was the man to end the Palestinian uprising just as hedid the 1970 Gaza revolt, when the army built wide roads throughthe refugee camps, set up ambushes for guerrillas and resettledseveral thousand Gazans in the Sinai Desert.   ``In Gaza, it took us seven months, day and night, but thegovernment was determined then to bring and end to terror andviolence, and we did it,'' he said, adding that all that was needednow was resolve.   ``It's not that Israel does not have strength. Israel hasmilitary strength and economic strength. The problem is theweakness of the national will. But in my opinion, it's all still inour hands,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
