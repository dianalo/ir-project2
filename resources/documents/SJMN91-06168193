Thatright there was reason enough to hate it.;    Thankfully, it wanted no money,just five of my friends. It promised good luck (within four days) if I met theconditions, bad luck if I broke the chain. You know, all the usual stuff.;   Except this:;    Jerry West, Billy Cunningham, Rick Adelman, Mike Dunleavy,Wayne Embry. This letter had passed through their hands and many others aroundthe NBA. Bob Ferry, Kevin Loughery, Mike Schuler, Stan Kasten, Rod Thorn.;   And it wasn't just the rich and famous of sports.;    Authors Judith Krantzand Jackie Collins. Newspaper columnists Herb Caen, Art Buchwald, WilliamSafire. Cosmopolitan editor Helen Gurley Brown. Don Hewitt, executive producerof 60 Minutes.;    West, the Lakers' G.M., got it from Judith Krantz who gotit from Helen Gurley Brown who got it from Buchwald who got it from PierreSalinger. Salinger, the veteran ABC News correspondent, explained in a coverletter to his five friends/victims, &quot;Having received this letter on my 65thbirthday, I have no choice but to send it on as ordered. I am getting too oldto take a chance of breaking the chain.&quot;;    Buchwald forwarded the letterwith this warning: &quot;The last person to break this chain was seated next toMorton Downey Jr. at her next dinner party.&quot;;    Brown, the Cosmo editor, heldthe letter for more than a month last summer before finally she &quot;caved in.&quot;;   &quot;Perhaps you will not cave in,&quot; she wrote Krantz and four other friends, &quot;butthat might be like asking Neil Bush to contribute to Howard Metzenbaum's nextcampaign fund.&quot;;    Krantz, a Bel Air resident and a big Lakers fan, used theletter as an opportunity to chide West for a couple of his personneldecisions.;    &quot; . . . If Michael Cooper had not been sent packing to Rome,and if Orlando Woolridge had not been heartlessly traded to Denver, we wouldignore this,&quot; she wrote. &quot;But with so few Lakers left . . . we cannot affordto take chances. We need all the luck we can get.&quot;;    And, as we now know, itwasn't nearly enough luck to beat Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls.;   Rolando Blackman, Ernie Grunfeld, Mike Gminski, Mitch Kupchak, Tom McMillen.Skip Caray. Bob Weiss. The list goes on, and includes some ordinary folk,too.;    One guy, a sports fan from Cleveland, asked that the letter (i.e. thegood luck) not be sent to anyone rooting for teams that play in the AFCCentral, unless that team was the Cleveland Browns. The man issued similarrequests for the Big Ten Conference, the Little Six Conference and the N.L.East, but he didn't bother making any such stipulations for the A.L. East, toowell aware of the hopelessness of the Cleveland Indians, evidently.;   Another guy complained that he'd already received this letter once. Except hewasn't really complaining. He reported that he'd had good luck -- &quot;four daysafter the previous missive,&quot; he said -- and shamelessly confessed he waslooking for more.;    Me? I don't believe much in good luck and I sure haven'thad any lately. But, yes, I sent the letters out. I victimized five of mydearest friends. As Ben Bradlee, the editor of the Washington Post, wrote tohis five victims, &quot;A man will do anything out of fear.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Bud Geracie column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910616  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  593  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday June 16, 199100168193,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
