Background</ITAG>FAR 15.413-1 provides that after receipt of proposals none of the informationcontained in them shall be made available to the public. FAR 15.413-2 providesthat, when agency regulations authorize the Alternate II procedures inFAR 15.413-2, those procedures may be used, instead of the procedures inFAR 15.413-1.This proposed rule adopts the alternate procedures in FAR 15.413-2 forUSDA. FAR 15.413-2 permits disclosure of proposals outside the Governmentonly to the extent authorized by, and in accordance with, the proceduresin FAR 15.413-2(f). This proposed rule also retains the restrictions relatingto release of proposal information in FAR 15.413-1, paragraphs (a) and(b), notwithstanding adoption of the procedure in FAR 15.413-2.The USDA is proposing to adopt these alternate procedures in order to obtainthe opinions of outside experts for evaluating proposals which involvea high level of detailed expertise, especially in areas of complex andconstantly changing technology, such as ADP and telecommunications resources.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Executive Order No. 12291</ITAG>OMB Bulletin No. 85-7, dated December 14, 1984, establishes the requirementsfor Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review of agency procurementregulations. This regulation does not fall within any of the categoriescited in the Bulletin requiring Office of Management and Budget review.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because this rule does not containinformation collection requirements that require the approval of OMB under44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The USDA certifies that this rule does not exert a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule is intendedto permit USDA to implement an authority under the FAR to release proposalsoutside the Government for evaluation.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Part 415 </ITAG>Government procurement, Contracting by negotiation.
