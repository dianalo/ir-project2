The system can provide long-distanceprojection of parallel rays. It will be helpful for efficient utilizationof light in cities and can increase the degree of freedom in carryingout urban development. The total efficiency for the introduction intooptical fiber can be up to 40 percent. With no heating coil incorporated,there is no danger of fire. The standard size of a light condenser is2 m in dome diameter and 2.5 m in height. Auxiliary artificial lightis used for backup purposes when it is cloudy. Heat pumps operating onsolar thermal energy are employed to maintain air conditioning for 24hours a day in order to ensure the establishment of an environment whereresidential areas exist in the neighborhood of office areas. Seven automaticsolar light collection and transfer systems are currently in practicaluse at the Arc Hills building. The combination of Fresnel lens and opticalfiber is more than six times as high in efficiency as a reflecting mirror.(5 figs, 3 tabs, 8 photos, 6 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
