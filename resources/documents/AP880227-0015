QUINN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Part-time resident George Bush was wayout in front Friday night as Maine Republicans launched a weekendof GOP presidential caucuses, his campaign said.   Statewide, the vice president's campaign claimed to have won 166of the 234 state delegates selected so far for the April conventionin Bangor, at which 22 national delegates will be chosen.   The Bush campaign said Pat Robertson so far has received 28state delegates, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas has collected 20 and Rep.Jack Kemp of New York has garnered five while 15 delegates wereuncommitted.   The results of the Republican caucuses do not bind stateconvention delegates and party leaders were not bothering tocompile the tallies right away.   The delegates totaled by the Bush campaign included the 137selected in caucuses in 43 towns since late January.   The Republicans will select the rest of the 1,506 statedelegates during caucuses Saturday and Sunday.   Bush and Dole forces had forged an uneasy alliance before thecaucuses to frustrate Robertson forays in delegate-rich areas asthey faced an influx of first-time voters from fundamentalistchurches.   Robertson supporters warred with Bush backers over voting rulesFriday night at the Republican caucus in Portland, Maine's largestcity, but tempers cooled when most of the 33 delegate slots atstake were evenly divided between the two.   Each camp came away with 15, while Dole received the rest afterthree hours of heated procedural voting and brokering.   The local Republican organization in Portland became the firstto drop its winner-take-all standard in favor of proportionalrepresentation.   Bush and Dole factions conferred continuously during thePortland caucusing but, in the end, the Dole supporters sided withRobertson's campaign in scrapping the all-or-nothing allocation ofdelegates.   State party chairwoman Karen Stram, watching the Portlandvoting, acknowledged that feelings were running high in the variouscamps. Stram said her job was ``to be sure that everyone comes outof it feeling they got a fair shake.''   She also said statewide turnout could reach 15,000 or more bythe end of the weekend.   ``No question, we're up three times at least'' over previousyears, she said.   Organizers say their primary goal is to win as many as possibleof 1,506 state convention delegate slots for their partisans. Butparty regulars also say the Bush-Dole coalition reflects fears thatthe state Republican organization could be taken over byRobertson's supporters, a repeat of what happened in Michigan.   John Solberg, Robertson's state coordinator, this week chargedthat ``the Bush and Dole campaigns are attempting to keep themajority silent in the democratic process.''   Solberg made his comments after the GOP caucus in Waterville, atwhich Robertson won a straw poll but came away with no delegates.   Participants in the straw poll split four ways, with Robertsonleading with 57 votes, Bush 40, Dole 20, and Kemp eight, Solbergsaid. But Bush and Dole backers joined together in the caucusing toblock Robertson from maintaining a winner-take-all plurality. Thecaucus's 12 delegate slots for the state convention were awarded tothe stop-Robertson combine.   Solberg said a similar deal was struck at the GOP caucus inKittery last week.   Gov. John R. McKernan Jr., who has been campaigning for Bush,who has a summer home in Kennebunkport, said Thursday the vicepresident's campaign was acting in self-interest to ``maximize thenumber of delegates'' it could lock up. He called Solberg'scomplaint ``amusing,'' saying that Robertson organizers hadthemselves sought to build anti-Bush coalitions around the state.   ``This is not fun and games,'' said McKernan, Maine's firstRepublican governor in two decades. ``We're talking about the nextpresident of the United States.''   State Sen. Pamela Cahill, a Dole organizer, also dismissed theRobertson campaign charge. ``We operated within the caucusstructure and got those Dole delegates,'' she said Friday.   Acknowledging that a Bush-Dole alliance here represented a fardifferent attitude than seen nationally between the competingcampaigns, Cahill said she was motivated by concern for ``thewell-being of the Republican Party.''   ``I guess I'm too damn parochial,'' Cahill said. ``I'm concernedbecause I don't want to see Robertson people getting all thepositions ... blocking out the rank-and-file Republicans whosupport our party in good times and bad ... and then leaving theparty in disarray,'' she said.   At the few Republican caucuses held already, turnout appears tobe much higher than in the past, a factor attributed to Robertson'sgrass-roots drive.   But a hostile reception for the insurgents could undercut thepotential for long-range party growth, warned an organizer for theflagging Maine campaign of Kemp.   ``We're sending the people home and telling them `you're notwelcome,''' said George Smith, who predicted the establishmentalliance would make Bush ``the big winner.''   In Michigan, Robertson supporters won control of the state GOPcommittee, working in cooperation with Kemp backers. The coalitionfell apart, however, in January when Kemp's camp defected to joinforces with Bush and split the state's 77 GOP delegates.   Democrats caucus statewide on Sunday, and first place isconceded to Gov. Michael Dukakis of neighboring Massachusetts.</TEXT></DOC>
