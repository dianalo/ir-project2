Temperatures in Saudi Arabia are cooling somewhat, with dailyaverages of 78 degrees Fahrenheit in November and 70 degrees inDecember, but potential food spoilage is always a problem, shesaid.   Hotline home economists worked with USDA food scientists, themilitary and the U.S. Postal Service on a list of things to do andnot do.   Most importantly, don't send fresh meat.   ``Stick to dry beef, like beef jerky or beef slims,'' she said.``Canned meats, including chicken and tuna are okay, but hightemperatures may reduce quality.''   Templin said it would be a good idea for families to remindtroops not to eat foods that arrive in damaged or swollen cans.That often is a sign of food poisoning organisms.   Also, don't send high-moisture baked goods, such as pumpkinbread, because those are susceptible to mold. Pork and porkproducts, along with alcohol, are taboo in Saudia Arabia forreligious reasons.   Fragile good such as delicate cookies won't survive the tripintact. And products containing chocolate can melt in hightemperatures.   Foods recommended by hotline people include dense and dry bakedgoods, such as fruit cakes, commercially packaged cakes and cookiesin tins, dry cookies like ginger snaps, and crackers.   Others on the send list, include: raisins, apricots and otherdried fruits, along with canned nuts and fruit, and commerciallyprepared trail mix. Jams, jelly and peanut butter packed in jarsalso can be included, along with hard candies and candy-coated gum.   Specialty items like instant soup, fruit drink mixes andcommercially packaged popcorn in tins are others.   ``Some regional favorites like Texas hot sauce and Cajunseasonings are being sent to troops, and that's a great idea, aslong as they aren't perishable and can handle transport and heat,''Templin said.   For more advice on shipping food and other food safety issued,the USDA hotline is available at 1-800-535-4555 weekdays from 10a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern time.
