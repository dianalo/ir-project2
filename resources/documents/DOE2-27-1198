The structure of Yukawa couplings is carefully investigated andspecial attention is paid to nonrenormalizable interactions in determiningthe flat directions and the induced cubic couplings that are forbiddenin the original model. The importance of twisted oscillator modes andmoduli to this effect is explained. One specific example is presentedin detail and its phenomenological consequences such as quark and leptonmasses, proton stability and neutrino masses are discussed. In this examplethere are built-in 'stringy' symmetries that protect Higgs doublets fromgetting large tree-level masses.</TEXT></DOC>
