Unlike many Justices, Mr. Marshall was well known to thepublic before President Johnson nominated him to the Court.During nearly a quarter century as legal director of theNAACP he won more than two dozen cases in the Supreme Court.By now it is hard to comprehend the evils he fought. As alawyer his greatest victory was Brown v. Board of Education.This defeat of separate but equal was only the culmination ofmany years battling segregation. In a 1948 integration case,he used arguments that would later resonate with MartinLuther King. &quot;Classifications and distinctions based on raceor color have no moral or legal validity in our society,&quot; Mr.Marshall wrote. &quot;There can be no separate equality.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   This is the view that triumphed. It is the view that nowsits firmly at the center of the American people's view ofwhat constitutes fundamental fairness in the nation's civiclife. Now, however, there is new tension over whatconstitutes fairness and it has been our view that the idealarticulated by Mr. Marshall in the earliest days of thecivil-rights movement has more recently moved precariouslyclose to approving quotas. That tension has been no moreevident than in the recent history of the Supreme Court, withJustice Marshall dissenting in cases that have attempted tomove away from quotas. As we have said before, we wish theheroes of the great civil-rights battles would have moreconfidence in the durability of their achievement. Problemsstill exist, but their largest achievement is that this isnow a society of goodwill, not racism.   It is also worth noting that in his long tenure on theCourt, Justice Marshall distinguished himself in other areasof the law. He was prophetic in his dissent from a 1985opinion that upheld the constitutionality of the RICOstatute. He predicted the avalanche of today's abusiveracketeering cases. He also managed to persuade the otherjustices within a matter of hours one day in 1973 to reversea bizarre order Justice William Douglas issued purporting tostop Commander in Chief Nixon from bombing Cambodia.   In our day, of course, the law remains a powerful vortexfor public-policy making, and it is entirely proper that thisphenomenon should have found its way into the country'srecent succession of presidential campaigns. Presidentialcandidates have pledged in their campaigns to promote ajudicial philosophy that displays a sense that communitystandards must be given weight against extreme civillibertarianism, that admits the virtue of restraint andacknowledges the existence of original intent. Thosepresidential candidates have won these elections, and it isin no sense an unsupportable shock to the public consciencethat President Bush should think now to fulfill such a pledgein considering an appointee to the Court.   Mr. Bush has a surfeit of eminent candidates from which tochoose. Federal Appeals Court Judges Edith Jones and LaurenceSilberman, runners-up for the seat filled by Justice DavidSouter, would make fine Justices. One of the most attractivequalified nominees is former EEOC chief Clarence Thomas,whose lively intellect and calm demeanor make him anexcellent federal appeals court judge in Washington. We hopethe White House will not fear candidates with a paper recordof clearly stated views.   It remains to be seen what kind of atmosphere will greetMr. Bush's nominee. While no one in public life can shrinkfrom debating the issues that lie at the heart of thesematters, it would be unfortunate if whatever controversyensues is framed as a battle over whether Justice Marshall'slegacy is to be preserved or abandoned. Thurgood Marshall'sachievement -- the elevation of black Americans to equallegal status in the life of the United States -- is not indanger. It is a permanent legacy.</TEXT></DOC>
