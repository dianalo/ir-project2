Chloroprene monomer, resin, and modifierwere mixed and added with a water solution in a large glass-lined reactorvessel for polymerization producing either full conversion latex or asolid material. The company provided complete preemployment physicals,and one every 3 years for employees less than 40 years old and once every1.5 years for those over 40. Three cases of asbestosis were reportedin pipe-insulation workers. Some cases of skin cancer were documentedand hair loss due to chloroprene exposure was also noted. A chloroprenemonitoring program was begun in the early 1970s; corrective actions weretaken to lower chloroprene concentrations. Asbestos was no longer usedon process piping but potential exposure still exists. Acrylonitrilewas used as a copolymer in chloroprene production. Exposure to talc wasalso possible. Freon-22 was manufactured at this location. The authorsrecommend that exposure to chloroprene be kept as low as possible.</TEXT></DOC>
