The regulations (10CFR61)require that a portion of the wastes generated by nuclear power plantsbe in a form that possesses long-term (300 years) stability against lossof integrity, before it is accepted for disposal. For these types ofwastes, the generator is faced with two choices; solidify the wastesor package them inside a container (HIC) that provides the necessarylong-term stability, to the waste form. Solidification increases disposalvolume, reduces transportation efficiency and results in increased costsfor disposal of a given volume of radioactive waste and HIC designs availableat that time were either concrete or polyethylene and hadn't been designedto meet the more stringent criteria relating to container life and compactionby burial overburden. The increased burial depth at the commercial wastedisposal site at Hanford, made polyethylene a difficult material to usein manufacturing high strength containers and emphasized the benefitsto be gained from the development of a HIC made from a corrosion resistantmetal. A developmental process was, therefore undertaken, and has resultedin a metallic high integrity container (HIC) that has received the mostextensive review of any burial container licensed in the United States.This paper addresses the developmental program for metallic high integritycontainers (HIC)s conducted over the past three years, including theanalytical methodology and prototype testing.</TEXT></DOC>
