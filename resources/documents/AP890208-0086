Ban On Assault Rifles Draws Mixed Reviews</HEAD><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Police officers, gang workers and a gangmember expressed skepticism that the city's ban on military-stylerifles will curb violence.   The City Council on Tuesday unanimously voted to outlawimmediately the sale or possession of semiautomatic weapons like theAK-47 assault rifle that was used to kill five children in aStockton schoolyard Jan. 17.   Mayor Tom Bradley called the weapons ``tools of murder and mayhemwhose sole purpose is killing human beings,'' and signed the measureinto law.   Owners of such weapons have 15 days to either dispose of them orrender them inoperable. Violators face up to six months in jail anda fine of up to $1,000.   The law applies to any semiautomatic rifle that holds 20 or morerounds or a semiautomatic shotgun that can be fired more than sixtimes.   Rick ``Lil Loc 2'' Hardson, who identified himself as a member ofthe Crips Four Trey gang, said the ban probably wouldn't deter gangmembers from acquiring semiautomatic weapons. He said such guns canbe purchased on the street from drug addicts for as little as $30.   As for gang members, ``They'll say, `Well, a gun is illegal. ...So what?'... Everything they do is illegal,'' the 18-year-old said.   Steve Valdivia, head of the city's Community Youth Gang Services,said that he supports the new law but that assault rifles are notused as frequently as other weapons in gang slayings.   The director of Californians Against Handgun Violence praised theban. ``We think it's a terrific thing that they're doing,'' saidLuis Tolley. ``Even if it proves to be merely symbolic, it's still avery important message.''   Detective Jimmy L. Trahin called the ban an overreaction. ``Ifthey want to do something, don't attack the gun, attack the guywho's using it in a crime,'' Trahin said.   The Stockton City Council unanimously adopted an ordinance Mondaybanning assault rifles, despite protests from gun owners who arguedthat the measure was unconstitutional.</TEXT></DOC>
