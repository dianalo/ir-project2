A case-control studywas conducted to determine the relative contributions of smoking andenvironmental factors to the elevated lung cancer mortality. Smokingwas the strongest predictor of lung cancer risk among both sexes, showinga dose-response relationship. The smoking-adjusted odds ratio among malesemployed in lead mining was 2.84 (95% confidence interval = 1.07 -7.53).Lung cancer risk increased linearly with years employed in mining andinteraction of a multiplicative type between pack-years of smoking andyears employed in underground mining was identified. The results suggestthat the need to further refine the hypothesis of a synergism betweensmoking and radon exposure. In addition, a concurrent study in the samearea was conducted. This study examined environmental factors such asheavy metals in dust and drinking water, radon in homes, and mining practicesunique to the Flat River area.</TEXT></DOC>
