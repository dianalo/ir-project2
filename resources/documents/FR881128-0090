The Court's remand requires that theDepartment consider the applicability of the 1988 amendments of the TradeAct of 1974 to the subject worker petitions.Investigation findings show that Phillips Petroleum is a fully integratedproducer of crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and refined petroleumproducts and as such the 1988 amendments to the Trade Act would not apply.The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 extended eligibilityfor trade adjustment assistance (TAA) to workers with independent firmsengaged in the exploration or drilling of oil and natural gas.Workers in the Eastern and Western Divisions of Phillips Petroleum's Explorationand Production Group (TA-W-19,035 and TA-W-19,314) were subsequently certifiedeligible to apply for adjustment assistance under TA-W-20,862 and TA-W-20,875,respectively. Workers covered under TA-W-20,862 and TA-W-20,875 have impactdates of July 19, 1987 and August 2, 1987, respectively. Both certificationsare based on an increased reliance on imports of crude oil used as feedstockfor company refineries in 1987 compared to 1986.Investigation findings on remand show increased company imports of crudeoil by Phillips Petroleum in 1986 compared to 1985 and in 1987 comparedto 1986. This finding together with the decreased production and employmentfindings in the Eastern and Western Divisions provide sufficient justificationto certify workers in the subject divisions with impact dates back to January7, 1986 for workers in the Western Division and February 19, 1986 for workersin the Eastern Division.It is recommended that workers in Corporate Engineering at Borger, Texas(TA-W-19,134) and in the Refinery and Natural Gas Liquids Processing Centeralso at Borger, Texas (TA-W-17,135) be denied eligibility to apply foradjustment assistance. Engineering activities at Borger did not accountfor a significant amount of time on crude oil. Workers at the Borger Refineryproduced refined products. U.S. imports of gasoline, the leading refinedpetroleum product made by Phillips, and dry natural gas declined absolutelyand relative to domestic shipments in 1986 compared to 1985. Phillips doesnot import refined petroleum products.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>After careful review of the additional facts obtained on remand, it isconcluded that increased imports of crude oil like or directly competitivewith the crude oil produced in the Western and Eastern Divisions of PhillipsPetroleum's Exploration and Production Group contributed importantly toworker separations and to declines in production and employment in theWestern Division, Denver, Colorado and in the Eastern Division, Houston(Bellaire), Texas. In accordance with the provisions of the Trade Act of1974, I make the following revised determinations:<ITAG tagnum="21">All workers of Phillips Petroleum Company's Exploration and ProductionGroup in the Western Division, Denver, Colorado who were laid off on orafter January 7, 1986 and before August 2, 1987 and all workers in theEastern Division, Houston, (Bellaire) Texas who were laid off on or afterFebruary 19, 1986 and before July 19, 1987 are eligible to apply for adjustmentassistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is further determined that the Department's initial negative determinationfor all workers of Phillips Petroleum Company's Corporate Engineering atBorger, Texas and all other workers at the Refinery and Natural Gas LiquidsProcessing Center, Border, Texas be affirmed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC, this 9th day of November, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Barbara Ann Farmer,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director, Office of Program Management, UIS.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-27374 Filed 11-25-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-30-M</ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
