Six workers were killed in an accident at the yard last July.   Wednesday night's accident occurred as workers were installingthe intermediate propeller shaft into the USS Elliot, said FredHallett, vice president of finance at the National Steel andamp;Shipbuilding Co.   ``They were in the process of aligning the shaft when theforward part fell approximately 20 to 25 feet to the deck of thedrydock,'' Hallett said.   When the shaft fell, it dislodged scaffolding that had beenerected below, Hallett said.   One worker told Hallett the crew was preparing to drive in thebolts when the propeller shaft released and fell, Hallett said.   The most seriously hurt employee received injuries to his headand arm, Hallett said. The man, who was not identified, was listedin critical condition at University of California-San Diego MedicalCenter.   One was listed in serious condition, three others in faircondition, two were released after treatment and two were notexpected to be hospitalized, officials said.   In the accident July 10, six people were killed and six injuredwhen a steel basket lifting workers fell 30 feet to the deck of aNavy ship.   The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration citedthe company for 19 safety violations in that accident.   In March, OSHA accused the company of 100 other violations,which carried $72,300 in penalties. The company is appealing thepenalties.   Hallett said 80 percent of the OSHA recommendations werecompleted and the rest were in progress.   The shipyard employs 2,500 workers, Hallett said. Between 150and 200 were on duty at the time of Wednesday's accident.</TEXT></DOC>
