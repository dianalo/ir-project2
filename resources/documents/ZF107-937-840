Technology Way Orem, UT 84057 (801)222-5500andM;DESCRIPTION: Word processing software for VMS systemsandM;TEST CONFIGURATION: WordPerfect version 5.0 on a Micro VAX II running VMSversion 5.1andM;PRICE AS TESTED: $4,500andM;PROS: * Integrates text and graphics * Offers enhanced macro capabilities *Is compatible with IBM PC versionandM;CONS: * Graphics conversion utility is not yet availableandM;READER SERVICE: Fill in No.andP;  401 on Reader Service CardandM;Nearly everyone--from students to business executives to scientists--has aneed for word processing.andP;  Word processing software packages are, in a sense,the computing &quot;ties that bind.&quot;andP;  It is precisely because word processors aresuch a common application that they should incorporate a wide range offeatures and capabilities to meet the needs of diverse users.andM;Wordperfect Corp. has achieved such an ideal with the latest release of itspopular word processing software, which has already established a followingin the world of IBM PC-compatible Micros.andM;With WordPerfect, users can combine text and graphics to create polisheddesktop publications--for example, newsletters.andP;  Most users will also finduseful the editing functions, which include footnoting, endnoting, outliningand indexing.andP;  Mathematicians and scientists will be happy to know that theycan easily access technical character sets for their symbols and equations,and business users will like having Sort and Merge functions to generateaddresses for bulk mailings.andP;  And everyone will be pleased that WordPerfecton the VAX is compatible with WordPerfect on the PC.andM;Much of the original &quot;look and feel&quot; of WordPerfect has been retained sinceour last look at this product.andP;  (See &quot;The Word on WordPerfect,&quot; DigitalReview, March 23, 1987, page 63.)andP;  WordPerfect functions are invoked throughfunction keys and layered menus.andP;  While the interface remains simple andstraight-forward, WordPerfect's capabilities have been expanded through theaddition of several appealing features.andM;A particularly attractive feature is the desktop-publishing capabilityprovided by a new graphics command that lets users incorporate graphicsimages from a variety of sources into their WordPerfect docuemtns.andP;  WithinWordPerfect, these images can be moved, resized or even inverted, lettingusers customize their documents.andM;Another useful desktop-publishing feature, kerning, lets users vary thespacing between characters.andP;  With this feature, users can tailor theirprintouts by eliminating excess white space within lines of text.andM;The new version of WordPerfect also provides a macro editor and a macroprogramming language for creating and editing macros.andM;OFF AND RUNNINGandM;DR Labs tested WordPerfect version 5.0 on a MicroVAX II running VMS version5.1.andP;  Regardless of the disk on which WordPerfect is being installed, thesoftware requires 23,500 blocks on the system disk--a hefty chunk.andP;  Theseblocks are released after the installation, but another 23,000 blocks ofspace are required on the target disk.andP;  If WordPerfect is to be run on aVAXcluster, it must be installed on the SYS$COMMON default directory on thesystem disk.andM;Once WordPerfect has been installed and the supplied function-key templatehas been put on the user's keyboard, WordPerfect can be invoked by typing WPat the DCL prompt.andP;  This calls up a screen that is empty except for a singlestatus line in the bottom right corner.andP;  This status line displays the IDnumber of the current document, the current page number, and the line andcolumn position of the cursor.andM;The status line also indicates when certain WordPerfect functions are active.andO;For instance, if a user turns on underlining, part of the status line is alsounderlined and remains so until underlining is turned off.andM;Once at this screen, users can begin typing text for a new document, or theycan retrieve an existing document by using WordPerfect's Retrieve command,invoked by pressing the PF1 and F18 keys, and typing the VMS directory andfile name of the desired document.andP;  Documents can also be loaded intoWordPerfect with the List Files command (invoked by pressing teh F11 key),which allows users to look at all files in a specified directory and letsthem perform file management tasks such as renaming and deleting files.andM;WordPerfect is document-oriented.andP;  That is, settings (margin width, pagenumbers, etc.) are placed at specific locations in a document and remain ineffect from that point on, until either the document ends or new settings areinserted into the document.andM;By selecting the Format command (presssing andless;PF1andgt; andless;F14andgt;), users can choosefrom a menu of options to change various line, page and document settings.andM;The Line option lets users change settings like hyphenation, justification,line spacing and margins.andP;  The Page option includes settings for pagecentering, header and footer settings, top and bottom margin settings, andpage numbering.andP;  The Document option lets users change WordPerfect's initialpitch and font settings as well as create document summaries.andM;A document summary feature provides a clever mechanism that allows users tosummarize and save important information about a file, such as its creationdate, subject matter and author, as well as comments about the file.andO;Document summaries cannot be printed, but they let users obtain informationabout existing files without having to retrieve them.andM;With WordPerfect's many cursor-movement keys, users can move throughdocuments in small steps or in great leaps and bounds.andP;  The arrow keys onLK210-style keyboards move the cursor up, down, right or left, and thePrevious Screen and Next Screen keys move the cursor 22 lines backward orforward.andM;For users in a rush, the Home function (invoked by pressing the 7 key on thekeypad--andless;KP7andgt;) can be used to move quickly through the document.andP;  By pressingthe Home key twice and then pressing the down-arrow key, users can move tothe very end of their documents.andP;  Similarly, users can move to the top oftheir documents by pressing andless;KP7andgt; twice, followed by the up-arrow key.andM;WordPerfect's many editing functions will also appeal to users.andP;  In additionto standard word processing functions--which include boldface, centering,underlining, superscripts and subscripts--WordPerfect provides several otheruseful functions.andM;The Split Screen Option (andless;PF2andgt; andless;F9andgt;) is used to divide the WordPerfect screenin two.andP;  Users can then toggle between the windows for editing.andM;WordPerfect supports two column formats: Newspaper and Parallel.andP;  Either onecan be invoked by first defining and then enabling the columns throughoptions on the Math/Columns menu (invoked by pressing andless;PF3andgt; andless;F13andgt;).andP;  Columnscan be enabled and disabled throughout a document.andM;With the Block command andless;PF3andgt; andless;F10andgt; or by pressing the Select Key onLK210-style keyboards), a user can select a portion of a document to beedited.andP;  Once the text has been blocked, WordPerfect functions can be used tomanipulate this text as a whole.andM;PLENTY OF CHARACTERandM;In addition to the DEC multinational character set, WordPerfect supportsmyriad other character sets.andP;  Characters from these different sets can beinserted anywhere in a WordPerfect document with the Compose command(andless;Controlandgt; 2 or andless;Controlandgt; V).andP;  The Compose feature can also be used togenerate composite characters.andM;With the Line Draw command (andless;PF2andgt;andless;F9andgt;), users can draw boxes, graphs or otherillustrations in their documents--either on a clear screen or around existingtext.andP;  WordPerfect provides many line-drawing characters, such as singlelines, double lines, and several shades and sizes of solid blocks.andP;  Inaddition, users can pick their own line-drawing characters.andM;WordPerfect's footnoting, endnoting and indexing capabilities will hold upeven in the most complicated manuscripts and dissertations.andP;  WordPerfectallows footnotes and endnotes to be placed within the same document andprovides automatic referencing so that users do not have to concernthemselves with numbering their entries.andM;The Mark Text command (invoked by andless;PF3andgt;andless;F11andgt;) lets users mark text that is tobe included in an index or a table of contents.andP;  In addition, this commandcan be used to create references to other locations in the document, such asfigures, tables and graphs.andP;  There is even an option for a table ofauthorities, which can be used to generate a list of citations (cases andstatutes) for a legal brief.andM;WordPerfect's Math feature provides a limited but useful spreadsheetcapability.andP;  Users can set up columns and rows of data and then performcalculations down the columns or across the rows.andP;  Formulas can be set upwith four operators--add, subtract, multiply and divide--and are calculatedfrom right to left (not in order or operator precedence).andP;  Parentheses can beused to change the order of operations in formulas.andM;Mailing lists, personalized correspondence, phone lists and mailing labelscan easily be generated with WordPerfect's Merge command (andless;PF2andgt;andless;F17andgt;).andP;  Touse this, users must first create primary and secondary files.andP;  The primaryfile is a template file that typically contains text such as a form letterand merge commands.andP;  The secondary file contains the records to be mergedwith the primary file.andP;  The merge commands indicate which information fromthe secondary file is to be merged with the primary one.andM;Sooner or later, even the most sophisticated WordPerfect user may requiresome assistance.andP;  First-time users can work through the WordPerfect tutorial.andO;WordPerfect provides excellent on-line help that should guide users throughmost problems.andP;  The online help can also be used to illustrate the mapping ofWordPerfect functions to the keyboard.andM;Users enter Help mode by pressing the F9 key.andP;  From here, users can press anylettered key to look at an alphabetical listing of features beginning withthat letter, and they can press any WordPerfect function key to obtain adescription of its function.andM;Should users need more assistance, they can refer to the WordPerfect manualor to the WordPerfect Workbook.andP;  As everyone knows, however, you cannot findall of life's answers in a book.andP;  Fortunately, WordPerfect provides hotlinesupport for users.andM;WordPerfect's Speller and Thesaurus utilities provide further assistance tousers.andP;  While these utilities will not transform users into literary giants,they will help generate more polished documents.andM;WordPerfect's dictionary is composed of a main word list and a common wordlist, which is shorter than the main list.andP;  To speed processing times,WordPerfect always checks the common list before checking the main list.andP;  Anoptional word list, WPCORP - WP50 US.SUP, allows users to save their ownentries.andM;From within a WordPerfect document, users can invoke the Spell command(andless;PF2andgt;andless;F8andgt;) to check the spelling of a single word, a page of text or theirentire document.andP;  This utility also provides a useful phonetic look-upfeature that will aid the most horrendous spellers.andP;  The Thesaurus command(andless;PF3andgt;andless;F7andgt;) further complements WordPerfect's support system by providinglists of synonyms and antonyms.andM;A PRETTY PICTUREandM;WordPerfect's graphics capabilities let users combine text and graphicswithin their documents.andP;  Graphics images can be drawn directly intoWordPerfect documents from many different sources, including clip-art filesprovided by WordPerfect.andP;  Once these graphics images are drawn intoWordPerfect, they are saved in WordPerfect Graphics (WPG) format.andP;  Users canthen rescale, crop, rotate and even invert the images (Fig.andP;  1).andM;Our excitement about the new graphics capability was somewhat tempered by afew noticeable shortcomings.andP;  First, although we were successful in importingsixel graphics files into our documents, we were unable to import any ReGISgraphics files.andM;We were further disappointed to discover that an added utility, the GraphicsConvert Program, was incomplete.andP;  This program is designed to convertgraphics files from different formats--such as Macintosh Paint and PC PaintBrush--to WordPerfect's WPG format, which can be imported directly into adocument.andP;  Wordperfect Corp. is working to correct these problems.andM;Another enhancement in WordPerfect 5.0 is the expanded macro capability.andO;Previously, users could only create macros by recording WordPerfectkeystrokes.andP;  With this latest release, however, users can use the macroeditor and the macro programming language to create and edit their macros.andM;WordPerfect allows macros to be chained together or nested within othermacros.andP;  Macros can also be set to repeat themselves a specified number oftimes during execution.andP;  Macros created in WordPerfect version 4.2 can beconverted to version 5.0 format with the WPCORP CVT MACRO.EXE program.andM;WordPerfect's Text In/Out command (andless;PF2andgt;andless;F11andgt;) lets users import and exportdocuments stored in different file formats.andP;  ASCII files can be imported andconverted into WordPerfect format, and WordPerfect documents can be saved astext files.andP;  Similarly, WordPerfect 5.0 allows documents to be saved inWordPerfect 4.2 format.andP;  (Otherwise, WordPerfect 4.2 cannot read WordPerfect5.0 files.)andP;  WordPerfect 4.2 files are automatically converted intoWordPerfect 5.0 format when they are retrieved by the new version.andM;If users desire more file flexibility, they can use the Document ConvertProgram to convert documents in such file types as DEC DX, dBase and WordStarto the WordPerfect format.andM;WordPerfect's file management tools also let users lock files by assigningpasswords to them.andP;  Without the correct password, users will be deniedaccess.andP;  However, caution must be exercised when locking a file: A forgottenpassword will result in a lost file.andM;Printing is straightforward with WordPerfect.andP;  Because WordPerfect takes awhat-you-see-is-what-you-get approach to word processing, the text that theuser sees on the screen does not differ much from the text as it appears inprint.andM;WordPerfect supplies a generous list of supported printers and even includeshelpful information about the limitations of the printers.andP;  With the ListFiles command (andless;F11andgt;), users can select a WordPerfect document for printing.andO;Files can also be printed while they are still active with the Print command(andless;PF1andgt;andless;F13andgt;).andM;WordPerfect's printer utility gives users control over their documents andtheir printers.andP;  Documents can be viewed before they are printed, allowingusers to verify the layout before sending it to the printer (Fig.andP;  2).andM;WordPerfect also lets users queue their documents so they don't have to waituntil one document is printed before another can be submitted to the printer.andO;Users can also specify the size and type of paper to be used by the printer.andO;A Binding feature allows users to shift the text on odd and even pages sothat output can be bound without interfering with the text.andM;This latest release of WordPerfect will satisfy even the fussiest users.andP;  Anintuitive interface and a wide assortment of features promise to makeWordPerfect for VMS as popular as its IBM PC-compatible counterpart.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
