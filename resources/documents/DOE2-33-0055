Theremarkable flexibility of this device, which allows variation of therotational transform, shear, and magnetic well depth over a relativelywide range, is described. Engineering considerations of error fields,finite cross-section conductors, and plasma-coil clearances are alsodiscussed.</TEXT></DOC>
