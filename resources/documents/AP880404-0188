(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prosecutors may use evidence seized atthe home of a man accused in 16 slayings at his trial for theshooting deaths of two of the victims, a judge ruled Monday.   R. Gene Simmons, 47, is charged with murdering two formerco-workers during a 45-minute period last Dec. 28. Jim Chaffin, 33,and Kathy Kendrick, 24, were slain during a spree that prosecutorscontend was motivated by a desire for revenge.   Simmons' trial is scheduled to begin May 9 at Ozark after beingmoved from Pope County, where the deaths occurred.   Simmons, a retired Air Force master sergeant, also is chargedwith two counts of capital murder for the deaths of 14 relativeswhose bodies were found on his property near Dover after theRussellville slayings. Prosecutors allege that Simmons shot orsuffocated the 14 during the Christmas holidays. No trial date hasbeen set for those charges.   Prosecutors brought more than 40 pieces of evidence to thecourtroom Monday, including pistols that were used in theRussellville killings.   Attorneys for Simmons argued that the search of Simmons' homeprior to the issuance of a search warrant was an unconstitutionalviolation of his Fourth Amendment right to be free fromunreasonable searches. The lawyers asked Pope County Circuit JudgeJohn Patterson to suppress the evidence found on Simmons' property.   The judge did not rule on suppressing evidence in the deaths ofSimmons' relatives. One capital murder charge in that case arisesfrom the discovery of five bodies in Simmons' home, and the secondstems from the discovery of nine others in a shallow grave near thehouse and in the trunks of two abandoned cars on the property.   Defense attorneys contend the state's ability to collectevidence in the case would not have been hindered had authoritiespostponed the search until a search warrant was issued.</TEXT></DOC>
