Frequent projections of 15% to 20% annual industry growth are unrealistic, says a new study by the University of Michigan Business School, which put the 1985 market at $24 billion. To maintain such growth, &quot;all investment in plants and equipment would be consumed by automation in less than 10 years,&quot; says co-author Katherine Voss. She sees growth mirroring other capital expenditures -- between 5% and 10% a year.    Management is one stumbling block. &quot;Manufacturing is a very macho environment that is not very supportive of planning,&quot; says Thomas Gunn of consultant Arthur Young, noting that most automation is done on a machine-by-machine basis rather than through companywide planning. Moreover, he says, the yen's rising value may make manufacturers slower to automate because they believe they're getting a &quot;breather&quot; from Japanese competition.    Some niches grow quickly, including industrial sensors and machine controls, says William Rolland of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association.    TRAVEL INSURERS find a bonanza in non-refundable air fares.    Faced with up to 100% penalties for changing travel plans, budget air travelers are discovering trip-cancellation insurance. Travel Guard International designs a policy specially for the restricted-fare user. Available since January, it already accounts for 20% of business. At Access America Inc., New York, sales of a new trip-cancellation policy have been &quot;explosive,&quot; says Beth Godlin, marketing director. Mutual of Omaha Travel Insurance says such fares have increased its business 5%.    Coverage varies. The $16 Access America policy pays up to $300 for cancellation but only for illness, injury or other &quot;major unforeseen circumstances.&quot; Travel Guard's $19 policy will pay half the penalty up to a maximum of $200 even if you just change your mind. Thus, cancellation of a Continental Airlines peak-hour MaxSaver round-trip ticket between New York and Chicago would cost a total of $92.50 instead of the full $147 fare. But the traveler could also buy the airline's $178 round-trip fare, which is 75% refundable, limiting potential loss to $44.50.    ALTERNATIVE PESTICIDES gain ground as environmental concerns grow.    Insecticidal soaps, a chrysanthemum derivative and naturally occurring bacteria begin to replace chemical pest controls. Davey Tree Expert Co., Kent, Ohio, for example, cuts its use of chemical pesticides by 75% and increases its use of insecticidal soap. &quot;We have an obligation to use the safest alternative available to us,&quot; says Roger Funk, vice president.    Safer Inc., Wellesley, Mass., gears up, predicting natural pesticides will capture up to 30% of the market within five years. Seeing a 60% growth in sales last year, Reuter Laboratories Inc., Manassas Park, Va., launches a $1 million ad program aimed at the home-gardening market and starts a commercial division. Abbott Laboratories, experiencing 40% annual growth in sales of biological products for the agricultural market, spends $30 million for new laboratory space and manufacturing equipment.    Natural products affect only specific bugs. &quot;You have to be smarter about the way you use them,&quot; says a National Gardening Association spokesman.    A TASTE OF WALL STREET: Five McDonald's restaurants in the Youngstown and Warren, Ohio, areas provide stock quotes with their burgers and fries. The quote board, located above the food window, attracts the briefcase crowd after the market closes, says owner Sam Covelli.    PERFECT WEDDING GIFT? Chicago law firm Kalcheim, Schatz andamp; Berger gives some good clients pre-nuptial agreements as gifts. The firm even donated an agreement -- which usually costs $1,500 or more -- as a prize in a charity auction.    MARKET TIMING: Typical seven-room homes in Colorado Springs, Colo., are on the market only 22 days, according to the 1987 Coldwell Banker home price-comparison index. But in Fairbanks, Alaska, the typical home is on the market 203 days.    SUMMER CAMPS see renewed interest in old-fashioned camping.    General-interest sleep-away camps say they're attracting more campers despite continuing price increases. The reasons: The baby boomlet has produced more camp-aged kids, while a shakeout in the camping industry leaves fewer overnight camps than five years ago, says Robert Ezrol of Camp Taconic in Hinsdale, Mass. Skylake Yosemite Camp in California has revived waiting lists. &quot;We're filling in late February,&quot; says Michael Douglas of the Four Winds Westward Ho camp, Orcas Island, Wash.    But rising costs and changing family habits push camps to be more flexible. Instead of the traditional eight-week session, a growing number now offer four-week sessions as well. Soaring insurance premiums prompt many to cut back activities like horseback riding and trampoline. Specialty theater and sports camps continue to do well, but many say computer camps are now passe.    The decline in the college-age population makes it harder for some camps to find counselors.    BRIEFS: Microwave ovens, owned by 60% of all U.S. households, are now more common than dishwashers, says MRCA Information Services. . . . To help raise funds, the Massachusetts Cultural Alliance sponsors an exclusive edition MasterCard, dubbed the &quot;culture card.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
