The floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange was hectic for the first time since the Oct. 19 stock-market crash, traders said, as speculators inched back to the futures markets.    &quot;We finally saw action down here,&quot; said Mary Bergonia, a vice president of E.D. andamp; F. Man International Futures Inc.    By session's end, crude-oil contracts for December delivery had fallen 42 cents, to $19.07 a barrel, after hitting an intraday low of $18.85. Estimated volume was a heavy 102,333 contracts.    Pressured by crude, product prices also fell. Heating-oil futures fell 0.98 cent a gallon, to 55.23 cents, on the Merc. Gasoline fell 0.61 cent a gallon, to 50.89 cents.    &quot;The market got crushed,&quot; said Rick Donovan, head of E.F. Hutton andamp; Co.'s international-energy department. He said short-term, the energy-futures market probably hit bottom yesterday.    &quot;For the time being perhaps the worst is over,&quot; agreed Nauman Barakat, energy-futures analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. He noted that the slight recovery at the end of the session might &quot;follow through&quot; to this morning.    American Petroleum Institute inventory statistics, released after the market closed Tuesday, showed an 11.1-million barrel increase in U.S. crude stockpiles from the previous week, to 349 million barrels. Analysts said the stockpile is slightly above the 348.4 million barrels last year at this time.    In addition, stockpiles of distillate products -- which include heating oil -- are down from both last week and a year ago. U.S. stockpiles of heating oil, in fact, fell to 124.5 million barrels, the lowest supply in at least 30 years, in the petroleum-institute report, according to Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc., New York.    While the heating-oil fall would normally support prices, warm weather on the East Coast, where 75% of home-heating oil is used, &quot;took the wind out of the (market's) sails,&quot; added Mr. Beutel.    Crude-oil futures prices, already weakened by reports that some OPEC members want to increase the cartel's quota almost a million barrels a day, fell a third day in a row as the petroleum statistics &quot;added a little fuel to the fire,&quot; said Mr. Beutel. He added: &quot;People are starting to think about the OPEC meeting (Dec. 9) and I think the consensus is emerging that OPEC isn't going to have one of its more brotherly meetings.&quot;    Another analyst said a Dow Jones News Service report that Iran may concede discounts from its official selling prices also weakened prices.    In other commodities markets yesterday:    PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices fell on recession and deflation concerns. January-delivery platinum fell its daily limit of $25 an ounce to $500.30 while gold was off $2.40 an ounce to $468.20 in the December contract. December silver declined 14.5 cents an ounce to $6.695. Platinum, the most industrialized of the precious metals, mostly reflected the fears of a softening economy, and only its limits kept it from falling further, one analyst said. As proof, he said the expiring November contract, which has no limits, declined $26.10 to $493.20. Another analyst cited as a price-weakening influence, a statement by Robert Ortiner, undersecretary of Commerce, that he expects inflation during all of 1988 to be under 4%.    ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices rose on fears that Brazilian concentrate supplies may not be enough to meet demand if a freeze develops in Florida this winter. The November contract rose 2.75 cents a pound to $1.555. Total available Brazilian supplies of orange juice -- that is, production plus stocks -- are expected to total 280 million to 290 million gallons for the 1987-88 season beginning Dec. 1, the same as last year, according to Judy Weissman-Ganes, analyst for Shearson Lehman Bros. In addition, the lower dollar has triggered strong European consumption of the Brazilian product. &quot;Since supply and demand are forecast to be in near-balance, traders are concerned that crop difficulties here or in Brazil could aggravate the situation,&quot; she said. As a result, Mrs. Weissman-Ganes said, processors likely will be more reluctant to tender supplies against futures contracts and would tend to hold them for commercial sales.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Wheat-futures prices rose amid rumors that the Agriculture Department might reverse its decision to let processors bid for up to 10 million bushels of its surplus wheat every Friday. The decision has generated some protest because it would tend to depress prices as more wheat flowed into the market. However, an Agriculture Department official said the agency &quot;is standing firm&quot; on the decision. Soybean prices rose on speculation that the department is willing to subsidize the sale of 80,000 tons of soybean oil to Turkey. Corn futures prices also rose. </TEXT></DOC>
