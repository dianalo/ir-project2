Gorbachev's proposa tonegotiate _ and unilaterally reduce _ short-range nuclear missilesin Europe.   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said the U.S.rejection ``seriously concerns us.''   Baker rebuffed Gorbachev's offer in an unexpectedly long,3{-hour Kremlin meeting the secretary later described as a ``ratherextensive and in-depth discussion.'' He told reporters and he andthe Soviets had ``agreed that we would continue to disagreeagreeably on this.''   The secretary said the United States would not negotiatecutbacks in NATO's Lance missiles because Washington believes theweapons have served as an effective deterrent to the Soviet bloc.   Shevardnadze, meeting separately with reporters, said Gorbachev,in a ``crucially important conversation,'' had made ``a mostimportant proposal ... concerning reductions in Soviet tacticalnuclear weapons in Europe and a comprehensive resolution of thisquestion.''   In rejecting the offer, Shevardnadze said the Bushadministration had taken a ``very negative position'' and added,``This seriously concerns us.''   ``The proposals made by Comrade Gorbachev contain someunilateral measures covering the reduction of tactical nucleararsenals in Europe,'' he said.   The official news agency Tass said Shevardnadze had complainedthat the missiles could be used to deliver a first strike and thatmodernizing the NATO stocks _ which the United States has proposed_ would destabilize Europe.   Gorbachev's offer of reductions appeared aimed at pressuringNATO into dropping plans to modernize its 88 Lance missiles, mostof which are based in West Germany.   The Bush administration says the Soviet Union and its WarsawPact allies must unilaterally reduce what it says is an advantageof 12-1 in tactical missiles before NATO can consider beginningnegotiations.   Shevardnadze said both sides had agreed not to discuss thecontents of Gorbachev's proposal, but it would be published in theSoviet press Friday.   The Soviet Union did not propose discussions on short-rangemissiles, which have a range up to 300 miles, as part ofnegotiations on reducing conventional arms in Europe, Shevardnadzesaid, adding that Gorbachev had, however, made unspecified offersto discuss conventional force reductions at talks in Vienna.   On a more upbeat note, Baker said the two superpowers wouldresume talks next month on long-range nuclear weapons and a nucleartest ban. He announced that negotiations on longer-range, strategicnuclear weapons, recessed last year, would resume between June 12and 19.   He also said talks with the Soviets on a nuclear test ban wouldstart June 26.   Baker met with reporters before flying to Brussels, Belgium, totell the North Atlantic Treaty Organization about his two days oftalks, his first visit to the Soviet Union.   NATO itself is embroiled in a dispute over the missiles. Despitestrong resistance from the United States and Britain, West Germanyis insisting on East-West talks that would reduce the weapons. Mostof NATO's 88 Lance misiles are based in West Germany.   Baker appeared to rule out the possibility that Gorbachev andPresident Bush would hold their first summit meeting soon.   ``We agreed that we would further discuss that issue at the nextministerial (meeting) minister Shevardnadze and I have, probably inSeptember,'' Baker said.   American secretaries of state and Soviet foreign ministerstraditionally meet in New York each fall at the start of U.N.General Assembly sessions.   Baker met with Gorbachev in the Kremlin for about 3{ hours, 90minutes longer than scheduled, U.S. officials said.   Baker said that in the meeting with Gorbachev, which ran 90minutes longer than planned, he gave the Soviet president a letterfrom Bush expressing ``the Bush administration's broad view on howthey want Soviet-U.S. relations to develop.'' The letter alsoreferred to the Kremlin chief's wide-ranging overhaul of Sovietsociety domestic policy. According to Baker, it ``emphasized in thestrongest terms our wish to see perestroika succeed.''   On other issues, Baker said the Soviets gave U.S. officials alist of people who will be allowed to emigrate. The secretary hadmet Wednesday with a group of dissidents and Jewish refuseniks,people not allowed to emigrate, telling them Washington would``keep up the pressure to resolve individual cases.''   The Middle East also figured prominently in Baker's two day oftalks.   ``We think there may be a fair amount of common ground to ourapproaches to the Middle East,'' Baker told reporters. ``We talkedabout the idea of giving elections a chance.''   That was a reference to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir'sproposal for elections in the Israeli-occupied territories. TheSoviet Union has called the plan an attempt by Shamir to gain timeto crush the 18-month-old Palestinian uprising in theIsraeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   During a picture-taking session in the Kremlin's St. CatherineHall of the Grand Kremlin Palace before beginning his talks withBaker, Gorbachev said: ``Everything will be on the right road.''   Baker then returned to the Foreign Ministry guest house to signan agreement with Shevardnadze on cooperation in combatingpollution in the Bering and Chukchi seas in emergencies.</TEXT></DOC>
