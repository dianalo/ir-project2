(SAIC) officials say the efficiencyof MUMPS software earned the company a major Defense Department contract lastyear.andM;In March 1988, the DOD awarded the San Diego company an eight-year, $1.01billion contract to develop and install the Composite Health Care System(CHCS).andP;  The system, written in the MUMPS language, will be a computerizedhospital information system that will maintain medical records on the nearly60 million people treated at DOD medical facilities.andM;CHCS also will be an automated patient care system that integrates medicaland administrative functions in more than 750 medical treatment facilitiesaround the world.andP;  The fully deployed system will use about 2,000 computers,53,000 terminals and 19,000 printers, SAIC officials said.andM;The CHCS system integrates seven functional areas: patient admissions,patient appointment and scheduling, nursing, radiology, pharmacy, clinicaldietetics and laboratory.andM;10 Beta SitesandM;SAIC has deployed the system in 10 beta sites that range from small hospitalsto large medical facilities.andP;  Installation at these sites is runningsmoothly, said Helen Garamone, a public affairs officer at the ArmyInformation Systems Selection and Acquisition Agency in Alexandria, Va.andM;The 10 sites include the Ireland Army Community Hospital, Fort Knox, Ky.;andO;Eglin Air Force Base at Fort Walton Beach, Fla.; the Navy Marine Base at CampLejune, N.C.; and Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., saidTom Munnecke, chief scientist for SAIC's Information Resources ManagementDivision.andM;&quot;MUMPS' simplicity makes it an excellent language for end users,&quot; Munneckesaid.andP;  &quot;It integrates database management functions and operating systemfeatures within one linguistic framework.andP;  It's easy to learn, easy to use,and systems can be changed quickly without stopping operation.&quot;andM;Garamone noted that MUMPS applications can be developed usually in one-fifththe time of a similar application written in COBOL.andP;  In addition, Garamonesaid that the language's inherent productivity advantage was important toSAIC's successful bid.andM;The system will serve up to 150,000 users -- in both small clinics and largemetropolitan medical centers -- over the life of the contract.andP;  The MUMPSlanguage's flexible data structure and adaptability will allow CHCSapplications to run in any size facility, SAIC officials said.andM;Cost SavingsandM;With the support of its subcontractors, Digital Equipment Corp. and DiStarMedical Systems Corp., Concord, Calif., SAIC used MUMPS to develop the mostcost-effective system of all bidders, SAIC officials said.andM;&quot;SAIC met the greatest portion of the government's needs at the lowest cost,&quot;the Army's Garamone said.andP;  &quot;Not only did SAIC receive the highest technicalevaluation, but they outpaced competitive bidders because the companydeveloped the largest portion of contemplated software being asked for by theDOD.&quot;andM;&quot;MUMPS programmer productivity allowed us to adapt the software quickly tomeet the requirements of the contract,&quot; SAIC's Munnecke said.andP;  &quot;Thatproductivity was crucial during the contract competition.&quot;andM;As part of the bidding process, the DOD asked bidders to develop anddemonstrate software and system architecture, install and operate theirsystem design in a test hospital, and go through an extended benchmark testin which one computer simulated users and a connected computer simulated thedatabase.andP;  SAIC used the Fort Knox facility as its test hospital.andM;&quot;We built one of the largest VAX clusters in the world for the benchmarktest.andP;  It simulated up to 2,000 users, simultaneously accessing databases upto 20 gigabytes.andP;  MUMPS is well-suited to handle that amount of information,&quot;Munnecke said.andP;  The VAX cluster was powered by VAX 8550 computers.andP;  All thetest facilities have their own VAX equipment.andM;DiStar provided the core of the project's MUMPS software.andP;  SAIC developed theCHCS system around a philosophy adopted by the Veterans Affairs Department inits Decentralized Hospital Computer Program (DHCP), Munnecke said.andP;  DiStarhad developed that system, featuring its Fileman file management system, hesaid.andP;  Munnecke worked for the VA from 1978 to 1983, during the DHCP project.andM;A Minimalist ApproachandM;MUMPS enabled SAIC to use small teams of programmers who worked with doctors,nurses, pharmacists and other staff to devise different parts of the system.andO;&quot;The language supports programming in the small and design in the large,&quot;Munnecke said.andM;The company also developed basic software tool kits that were reused indifferent components throughout the system.andP;  &quot;We have a minimalist approach.andO;We only use 19 commands and 20 functions in the MUMPS language,&quot; Munneckesaid.andM;These 19 commands manage such functions as the software tools, debuggingsoftware and database queries, he said.andM;&quot;MUMPS is a neat, portable language.andP;  It's the software equivalent of theRISC [reduced-instruction-set computing] architecture in the hardware world,&quot;he said.andM;Munnecke described the compactness of a MUMPS application, comparing it to atypical COBOL one.andP;  In a traditional database management system, theprogrammer must go to the Job Control Language and to the operating systemand define what he is going to do, he said.andP;  From there, the programmer mustgo to the internal database supervisor and then to the COBOL compiler.andM;In addition, the program must contain correct addresses for the data, hesaid.andP;  With MUMPS, this control is central to the language.andP;  The databaseappears as though it were a variable in a MUMPS program, he said.andP;  &quot;Largecomplex databases in the traditional sense would look like sparse arrays inthe MUMPS world,&quot; he said.andM;MUMPS also has a very efficient caching algorithm for data that is stored ondisk, Munnecke said.andP;  It keeps the most recently and most frequently accesseddata in the buffer pool, he said.andP;  In addition, a data dictionary in a MUMPSsystem holds program code, which may be executed directly from thedictionary, he said.andM;CHCS users will realize some real benefits of using a MUMPS-based informationsystem, Munnecke said.andM;&quot;Staff efficiency increases because less time is spent on paperwork.andO;Patients receive increased personalized service from hospital staff memberswho have more time for them,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
