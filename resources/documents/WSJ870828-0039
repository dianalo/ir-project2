Instead, the talks threaten to illustrate that even the best of allies, with closely linked economies, can find it nearly impossible to discard all trade barriers in the face of political sensitivities and national concerns. As the talks head for an Oct. 5 deadline, prospects for a broad agreement are clouded by demands for concessions from Canada, which already is worried about national sovereignty, and by Congress's stiffening mood on trade issues.    For over a year, negotiators have been working on a treaty aimed at knocking down virtually all barriers between the world's two largest trading partners, whose $123.8 billion of two-way trade last year was 10% larger than that between the U.S. and Japan.    &quot;An agreement is doable,&quot; says U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, &quot;but it cannot be one in which the U.S. just makes a gift to Canada.&quot; Says Marc Lortie, press secretary to Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney: &quot;It now looks like it's going to be very tough. What we are facing right now is that we're negotiating with the administration, but we don't know what Congress will do.&quot;    The free-trade treaty has been enthusiastically endorsed by both President Reagan, who has long advocated a common market in North America, and by Prime Minister Mulroney. The talks were a Canadian initiative, pressed by Mr. Mulroney starting in 1985.    Officials on both sides acknowledge that free trade would benefit Canada economically more than the U.S., which would be throwing open the largest market in the world in return for greater access to a market only a tenth as large. Canada sells 75% of its exports to the U.S., while 22% of exported U.S. goods go north. And Canada has lately run big merchandise-trade surpluses with the U.S. But U.S. officials insist that free trade would mean growth for the U.S. economy, even if the favorable impact in Canada is larger.    It can be politically dangerous in Canada to advocate actions that could lower barriers against American influence. But Canadian leaders are fearful that growing protectionism in the U.S. could be disastrous for Canada, which recently has found itself on the losing end of a number of U.S. unfair-trade complaints involving key exports. Just last week, the Commerce Department ruled that Canadian potash is being sold in the U.S. at unfairly low prices. A free-trade treaty was seen as a way &quot;to secure as well as extend our market access to the U.S.,&quot; according to the Canadian government.    Last year, Congress reluctantly granted the Reagan administration special authority to negotiate the deal, and setting Oct. 5 as the deadline. Under the special authority, the agreement would require a simple majority of both houses to go into effect, and would be considered on an expedited basis, with no amendments permitted.    The negotiations have been conducted behind closed doors, but it's known that during the early months much progress was made on relatively easy issues -- such as agreement by Canada to gradually phase out or reduce many tariffs on U.S. goods, which are on average roughly double U.S. levies. But tougher issues, involving politically sensitive non-tariff barriers, were put off until the final stretch, which has begun this week in the Ontario countryside.    While Canada has generally pushed for free trade, it has carefully pressed for continued controls on U.S. economic activity in certain areas it regards as vital to its national sovereignty. These include U.S. influence in &quot;cultural&quot; industries, such as publishing, film distribution and broadcasting, and American investment in the financial services, energy and communications industries. In addition, Canada wants to leave untouched the existing U.S.-Canadian pact covering auto production, which has been an economic boon for Canada but which American negotiators complain is unbalanced.    Ottawa's top priority -- and a major reason it pressed for the treaty -- is to get out from under normal U.S. unfair-trade complaint procedures. If Canada gets its way, any such U.S.-Canadian trade disputes would be handled by an unspecified new mechanism. The demand for a new dispute mechanism has raised a furor among key members of Congress. After being briefed by Mr. Yeutter on the talks earlier this month, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) denounced the idea of a special mechanism. He said that while he would still favor a balanced pact, &quot;neither side really needs this agreement.&quot;    Added a top Reagan administration official: &quot;They're simply not going to get an exemption from our unfair-trading laws. There's no way they can sit up there in Montreal and Toronto and subsidize with impunity.&quot; The official says the most the U.S. will offer in coming weeks is some sort of special consultative mechanism for Canada, without teeth.    U.S. officials also say they will resist Canadian pressures on &quot;cultural&quot; issues. Even President Reagan has gotten involved in at least one aspect: Having heard complaints from Hollywood associates, he has personally urged Mr. Mulroney to drop current and planned curbs on U.S. movie distributors.    Canadians complain that the U.S., too, wants to keep certain restrictions, such as barring foreign ownership of television stations and of ships engaged in certain types of coastal trade. But both sides privately admit that the talks will turn on resolving Canada's demands to Congress's satisfaction, without inflaming negative opinion in Canada, where all 10 provinces must go along with any deal.    Tough U.S. responses on the special-mechanism and cultural issues only heighten political sensitivities in Canada. While the recent remarks by Sen. Bentsen and other senators attracted minimal U.S. press coverage, they were banner news north of the border. Public support for a free-trade pact has fallen to about 50% from nearly 60% earlier. Mr. Mulroney, who has become closely identified with the issue, has seen his approval rating sag to as low as 25% in some polls.    In industrialized Ontario, where the trade issue is especially vital, Provincial Prime Minister David Peterson, a treaty backer, has been forced onto the defensive on the issue in his re-election campaign. Brewery workers plan a one-day strike Sept. 9 to protest the pact, which they fear will cost jobs. A business coalition has raised $3 million to campaign for a free-trade accord and is using television ads. But a counter-coalition is gearing up its own campaign, featuring opposition from intellectuals, teachers and even clergy, who fear Canada's welfare state could suffer if a free-trade pact curbed government subsidies, as the U.S. has demanded.    A free-trade treaty, says Iowa Republican Rep. Jim Leach, a strong supporter, &quot;would make Canada the envy of the world, with guaranteed free access to the biggest market in the world.&quot; But, he warns, &quot;if it's so politically dicey in Canada that they have to win all the compromises, I don't think the administration will even bring it to Congress.&quot;    (Revised WSJ Aug. 31, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
