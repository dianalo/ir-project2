Computer buff Shahar Melamed said the game is being passedaround by computer enthusiasts and is popular among children inRehovot, a town near Tel Aviv housing Israel's prestigious WeizmanInstitute of Science.   Melamed is a photo editor at the Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot,which printed a story on the game Tuesday.   He said the program was signed only by ``Mike'' and added:``Some details of the program indicate it was done in the UnitedStates ... I don't know who wrote the program but he seems to be avery good programmer.''   The game is titled ``The Intefadeh,'' the Arabic word for``uprising'' that is commonly used for the nearly 17-month revoltagainst Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Palestinian children have made up their own street game on theuprising in which they take turns playing soldiers andstone-throwers, shoot with plastic guns and even hold mock funeralsfor ``martyrs.''   ``The Intefadeh'' is much more sophisticated, with playersgetting points for inflicting casualties _ but only with specificweapons allowed by changing rules.   These mirror real life, since Israeli soldiers face a complexset of regulations on using tear gas, rubber or plastic bullets andlive ammunition in putting down riots in the occupied lands.   The game has political implications. Players gain points forhelping to elect right-wing politicans. Players can lose points forupsetting world public opinion, again reflecting reality. Israelhas drawn international criticism over the more than 450Palestinian deaths in the revolt.   One set of instructions for the game begins:   ``You can use the wooden club you were issued on any rioter. Usetear gas any time you feel it is needed. You are authorized toshoot any rioter with rubber bullets. Shoot rubber or plasticbullets at any rioter who throws Molotov cocktail. You are notallowed to use live ammunition under any circumstances.''   The screen then shows a typical street in a Palestinian villageor town, with a lone Israeli soldier facing protesters. The trooperis pelted with rocks and firebombs and may respond with gunfire orchase the protesters along narrow ``streets.''   But the rules can change according to who is the ``defenseminister in charge,'' randomly chosen by the computer and listed atthe top of the screen.   Under Moshe Arens, Israel's real-life foreign minister, liveammunition cannot be used. But under Ariel Sharon _ a hawk forcedto resign as defense minister in 1983 during Israel's invasion ofLebanon _ live ammunition is a must.   Points are scored by inflicting as many casualties as possiblewithin a given time limit by using proper ammunition.   An injured soldier is evacuated by an ambulance or bursts intoflames and is declared dead. The computer labels him ``just anothervictim of Arab terrorism.''   Palestinians injured by tear gas move in dizzy circles, butintensify stone-throwing attacks later.   At the end of the game, an ``Israeli Defense Forces evaluationform'' is displayed on the screen, featuring the number ofprotesters injured, killed or captured. A successful player iscongratulated for helping Israeli right-wingers win the nationalelections.   The game is made even more complex, however, by the presence ofthe ``public opinion index.'' Indiscriminate shooting of protesterscan lead to a chilling judgment on the screen. One example:   ``Performance: You have gone wild. Public opinion index: zero.Your inefficiency in supressing the violence is appalling. You mustbe sleeping on the job. The government lost the elections mostly asa result of your inaction.''</TEXT></DOC>
