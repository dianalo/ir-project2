<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-45-0999 </DOCNO><TEXT>The value of magnetic resonance tomography in the diagnosis of paragangliomasin the head and neck has been studied and compared with CT and angiography.Magnetic resonance tomography on its own equals the accuracy of CT, butthe use of Gd-DTPA improves diagnostic accuracy. In 19 patients witha glomus jugulare tumour, MR tomography with Gd-DTPA accurately diagnosedall tumours larger than 5 mm. In seven patients with a carotid body tumour,it was possible to arrive at an exact differential diagnosis. Sensitivitywas better than that of CT or of sonography. Where there is clinicalsuspicion of a glomus tumour, magnetic resonance tomography with Gd-DTPAshould be the first investigation; if there is a positive finding, angiographyshould be carried out to demonstrate the circle of Willis.</TEXT></DOC>
