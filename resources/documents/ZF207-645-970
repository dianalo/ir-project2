(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The medium is the backupandM;In this issue we review Fastback II from Fifth Generation Systems Inc. andRetrospect from Dantz Development Corp., two powerful new backup utilityprograms.andP;  When choosing a backup system, however, hardware is perhaps themost important consideration.andP;  Recent changes in storage media have given usa number of new options for secondary storage, including digital audio tape(DAT), 8mm and 4mm tape, and erasable-optical cartridges.andM;While the Winchester hard disk remains a favorite for primary applications,the issues that should be considered when choosing a storage system forbackup or archiving include cost, longevity, speed, capacity,standardization, reliability and convenience.andM;As the chart below shows, an approach that is cost-effective for storingmoderate amounts of data may be very expensive if you need to store gigabytesof information.andP;  Floppy disks are excellent for holding 10 or 20 Mbytes.andO;When you are archiving multiple copies of a large database or storing biggraphics files, however, the massive capacity of digital tape cartridgeshelps offset the high cost of their drive mechanisms.andM;Older tape drives, such as the DC-600 and DC-2000, are less expensive thannew 8mm and 4mm units.andP;  However, their cartridges hold only a fraction of thecapacity of the newer &quot;digital&quot; tapes.andP;  We expect 4mm DAT drives to dropquickly in price and to grab more of the market in the next few years.andP;  TheDAT media is already much cheaper and more compact than older tapes.andM;Tape mechanisms for the 8mm format are more complex and expensive than DATmechanisms, and we expect 8mm to grow moderately in market share whiledropping little in price.andP;  Currently, 8mm tapes boast the highest capacity ofany of the media -- more than 2 Gbytes, twice the capacity of DAT.andM;Floppy disks, tapes and hard disks share the same basic technology, in whichan electric &quot;head&quot; is used to read and write a tiny magnetic field in a thinlayer of media.andP;  Floppy disks are supposed to stand up through millions ofread/write cycles, although they are not considered to be very reliableoverall.andM;Tapes may not handle as many read/write passes as floppy disks, but they canoffer lower error rates and longer archival storage life.andP;  Many DC-600drives, Teac drives and some DC-2000 units are conservatively designed forgood reliability.andM;Hard disks are generally very reliable.andP;  The most-common hard disk problemsoccur in the power supply or controller circuitry, leaving the media and dataundisturbed.andP;  Cartridge disks vary widely in reliability, with Bernoulli andSyQuest units outperforming Kodak/Verbatim cartridges.andM;The new optical discs promise longer archival life than traditional media.andO;In optical discs, data is stored as a pit in a surface or a polarizedcrystalline structure that reflects light a certain way.andP;  Since only lighttouches the surface, there is no problem of heads wearing out the media.andP;  InWORM (write-once-read-many) and CD-ROM media, which do not use magneticfields, the problem of magnetic data weakening is eliminated.andP;  Inerasable-optical media, the magnetic fields are much less sensitive tocorruption by outside magnetic forces than traditional media.andM;Backup speed varies widely among different media, from less than 1 Mbyte perminute for floppies, through devices that handle a range of 2 to 5 Mbytes perminute to a high of about 15 to 20 Mbytes per minute for Winchester harddrives (see table, Page 54).andM;An important goal in choosing from the middle range is to match the speed ofthe computer to the speed of the storage device.andP;  A speedy tape drive mightwork poorly with a Mac Plus if it frequently stops to let the computer catchup, then has to start the tape moving again.andM;DAT and 8mm tapes offer good performance with the possibility of much higherspeed under Apple's System 7.0.andP;  DC-600 tapes and erasable optical drives arein roughly the same performance range as current digital tape systems.andO;Bernoulli and SyQuest disk cartridges are quite fast, while Kodak/Verbatimcartridges are relatively slow.andM;Older devices like the DC-600 tape drives enjoy the kind of industrywidestandardization that's lacking among newer digital tapes and optical drives.andO;The advantage is that more software is available for standard devices,including such programs as Retrospect, and Fastback II.andP;  Support that makesdevices (cartridge drives, optical drives and hard disks) visible on theMacintosh desktop is a valuable feature that permits the use of hundreds ofMacintosh backup and utility programs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
