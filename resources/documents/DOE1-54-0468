Phys. 62,2533 (1987)] we introduced details of an analytical model for a top sideilluminated blocked impurity band infrared detector operating under backgroundlimited conditions (BLIP). In the present paper we extend that modelto a bottom side illuminated detector operating in the presence of thermallygenerated carriers (non-BLIP case) as well as the optically generatedbackground carriers. We display results of a parametric study includinggain, quantum efficiency, the excess noise factor, and hence the detectorfigures of merit responsivity and detectivity, as functions of the detectortemperature. Our study of the thermal noise includes the Poole--Frenkeleffect. The results of the present calculation determine optimal operatingtemperatures as well as bias voltages. We show that Si:As blocked impurityband detectors, doped to 5 x 10{sup 17} cm{sup -3}, will be backgroundlimited below 13.5 K at low background, 10{sup 10} photons cm{sup -2}s{sup -1} operation, with responsivities and detectivities on the orderof 5 A/W and 10{sup 14} cm Hz{sup 1}/sup //{sup 2}/W, respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
