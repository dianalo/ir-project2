Thirty-one countries signed the treaty that was reached in Montreal last September to curb the global use of chlorofluorocarbons, also known as CFCs. The Senate's vote was considered crucial to winning enough support world-wide to put the treaty into effect by January 1989.    The treaty can't take effect unless ratified by at least 11 countries, representing at least two-thirds of the world's CFC production. Mexico is the only other country to ratify so far. Japan's parliament is expected to vote before June, U.S. officials said.    CFCs are widely used as cooling agents in refrigerators and air conditioners, as computer-cleaning solvents and in making plastic foam. After it was discovered in the mid-1970s that chlorine from CFCs attack and destroy ozone molecules in the upper atmosphere, the U.S., Canada and some Scandinavian countries banned the use of CFCs in most aerosols, though not for other uses.    Depletion of the Earth's ozone layer is of concern because the ozone screens out harmful ultraviolet rays, which can cause skin cancer, cataracts and environmental damage. Scientists blame CFCs for a seasonal &quot;hole&quot; in the ozone layer over Antarctica. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration today plans to issue new estimates on global ozone depletion.    The treaty would hold production of the most commonly used CFCs at 1986 levels. Then, production would be reduced 20% by mid-1994 and 50% by 1999. The agreement also calls for a freeze on consumption of related chemicals known as halons in 1992.    Many environmentalists argue the treaty doesn't go far enough in restricting CFCs to save the ozone layer. However, the agreement will prompt the search for substitute chemicals. Meanwhile, prices for depleted supplies of CFCs are expected to at least double.    Five U.S. companies make CFCs, and now sell about $750 million a year of the compounds. The compounds in turn are used in products and services that bring in billions of dollars a year, according to the chemical industry. Under the treaty, companies making and using CFCs in 1986 would be assigned quotas, which could be traded. The two largest producers are Du Pont Co. and Allied-Signal Inc.    The U.S. accounts for about one-third of world CFC production. Other big producers are the Soviet Union, Japan and several European nations. </TEXT></DOC>
