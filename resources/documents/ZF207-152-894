(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Photon PaintandM;Color paint applications will soon be one of the most crowded categories ofMac software.andP;  Photon Paint is one of the latest entries.andP;  Though it isn'tthe equal of Studio/8 or PixelPaint, Photon Paint does offer a workablepainting environment, multiwindow capability, some interesting specialeffects, and, perhaps most importantly, a more affordable price.andM;Photon Paint was originally written for the Amiga, and MicroIllusions hasdone a creditable job of transforming it into a Mac program that's generallyfaithful to the Mac interface.andM;The Photon Paint environment is dominated by five palettes (tool, pen, color,pattern, and status) in floating, movable windows.andP;  Only the color palette issized appropriately for its function; the others are excessively large.andP;  On a13-inch monitor, they can cramp the drawing area.andP;  The pen and tool palettesare resizable; the pattern and status palettes should be.andM;In comparison to other Mac applications, Photon Paint is limited.andP;  Forinstance, only 14 standard pens are available, and the spray can isadjustable only to those pen sizes.andP;  Also, although pattern palettes can besaved, they can hold only 16 patterns.andP;  And though discontiguous selectionsare possible (Command-click), the lasso and rectangle cannot &quot;cinch down&quot; ona selection.andM;On the other hand, any Clipboard image may be used as a brush, and the RGBand HSV (hue, shade, value) tools provide an easy and powerful way ofrevising the color palette.andP;  Just click on two colors and Photon Paintcalibrates the values between them, creating intermediate shades for all theintervening steps.andP;  (Custom palettes can be saved).andP;  Palette changes areinstantly reflected in the current document.andP;  However, although the palettecan be restored with the Undo command, the change in the image isirreversible.andP;  Exercise care with unsaved documents.andM;Photon Paint supports five graphic modes: normal, add, subtract, blend, andwash, a watercolor-like effect.andP;  It also incorporates a number of dynamiceffects: bend, twist, tilt, and rotate.andP;  Controlled from dialog boxes,dynamic effects can be calibrated precisely (e.g., 43 degrees of rotation),but since you're not getting any visual feedback, precision doesn'tnecessarily translate into accuracy.andP;  The dynamic effects, however, do workwith lassoed objects -- without affecting any unwanted areas outside theselected item.andP;  Selections so modified can be dropped in the image (to testthe fit) and still be undone.andM;The most eye-catching dynamic effect is the ability to &quot;wrap&quot; a selection tocreate three-dimensional-looking shapes, such as cones, spheres, and cubes.andO;Lighting (direction, distance, and color of a spotlight) can be altered toenhance the 3-D effect.andP;  The results are pretty good with patterns, but withcolors, color banding can diminish the effectiveness of the wraps.andP;  Althougmost shapes are created fairly quickly, some can take a bit of time to beproduced.andM;Perhaps most useful in day-to-day operation is Photon Paint's multiple-windowcapability.andP;  Any number of documents (limited only by available memory) maybe open simultaneously.andP;  A handy Send to Rear button on each window lets youshuffle the stack.andP;  Pallettes are loaded with each document, but a lonk isnot maintained when another image with a different palette is opened.andP;  So thelast palette loaded will always be active.andP;  Bringing an image to the frontwill shift its colors to the currently active palette.andP;  If you forget aboutthis potentially disastrous feature and have saved your file in a previousversion, there is a Revert to last saved option.andP;  But if you don't save oftenand you open an old document while working on an unsaved image, watch out.andO;Your unsaved file will take on the color palette associated with the incomingdocument, and you can't undo this effect.andM;Also, you may open several windows into the same document with Photon Paint'smagnification tool.andP;  Click and it creates a four-times enlargement in aseparate window.andP;  Click again and zoom to eight-times enlargement (Fat-Bitssize) in yet another window.andP;  Zooms of 16- and 32-times normal can also beattained.andP;  Intermediate magnifications are possible with the plus/minusbuttons at the lower left of each window.andP;  Changes made in one view areupdated in the others.andP;  However, the windows aren't linked.andP;  If you scrollaround in one image and switch to another, you'll have to center again.andO;Also, Photon Paint does not remind you if a magnified view is alreadydeployed; it simply creates another window, leading at times to a stack ofmultiple -- or even identical -- zoom-windows under your drawing.andP;  Still, theability to display multiple, magnified views is valuable.andM;Photon Paint reads and writes only its own format.andP;  Luckily, that format isPICT2, although the program's Paint icon with PP superimposed gives no clueof this.andP;  Transportable files are a plus.andM;The Photon Paint disk also includes a black-and-white version.andP;  Only a shadowof the color program, it will not displace any of the black-and-white paintapplications already in existence.andP;  And colors cannot be assigned to adocument on standard Macs to be viewed in color on Mac IIs.andP;  The monochromeversion's saving grace is its ability to view Photon Paint files (it onlyreads PICT) on standard Macs.andP;  Finally, Photon Paint's manual is nicelydesigned but woefully short on information about the program.andP;  The generallyclear and concise version 1.1 update booklet is better.andM;Photon Paint 1.1 isn't the final word on color painting.andP;  However, itoperates reasonably well and, at $299, it priced at substantially less thanits competitors.andP;  If you're on a budget or don't need all the features foundin the higher priced programs, Photon Paint could be your paint program.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
