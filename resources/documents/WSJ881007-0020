Selected stocks moved ahead of the market again on takeover rumors and some actual deals, but with less spectacular gains than earlier in the week.    &quot;Only the urge-to-merge stocks are really in favor,&quot; said Kenneth P. Ducey, senior vice president of institutional trading at S.G. Warburg. He noted that traders have been hopping from one stock to the next as rumors sweep the market.    Mr. Ducey said that other than the activity in so-called story stocks, investors waited out the session in anticipation of today's employment data for September.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.24 ahead at 2107.75 after hovering above and below Wednesday's close throughout the day. The broader market also closed with narrow gains. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 0.53 to 272.39, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index added 0.31 to 153.93.    Advancers led decliners on the Big Board by 782 to 612, with 530 issues ending unchanged. Volume totaled 153,570,000 shares, down from Wednesday's 175.1 million shares.    S.G. Warburg's Mr. Ducey said the market could move higher today if the employment figures come in close to expectations.    Economists surveyed by Dow Jones estimate the unemployment rate fell to 5.5% last month and that nonfarm payrolls increased 291,000. That would compare with a 5.6% unemployment rate in August and a nonfarm payroll gain of 219,000 that month.    &quot;If the numbers are halfway decent, and nothing dramatic happens, we have a good chance for the market to move along,&quot; he said, adding that many investors with cash have been holding back until the report is released.    &quot;The path of least resistance (in the current market) is up,&quot; he said.    Trude Latimer, market strategist at Josephthal andamp; Co., said that while caution will increase as the presidential election approaches, she believes the market can reach a new post-crash high before then.    &quot;I don't expect it to explode to a new high and keep on going,&quot; she cautioned, &quot;but we could have a very orderly market and make a new high -- we don't have that far to go.&quot;    The Dow Jones industrials are just a little more than 50 points below the market's post-crash high set in July.    Despite recent reports that Salomon Brothers had turned fiercely bearish on equities, Robert S. Salomon Jr., co-director of equity research-investment policy there, said he is looking for a 10% to 12% return on U.S. equities over the next nine months.    &quot;We believe cyclical areas -- chemicals and steels, for example -- are taking on the characteristics of being sizable cash-generating machines, and because of the current cyclical sensitivity in the market, they are languishing and being ignored,&quot; Mr. Salomon said. He added that unlike some pundits ringing the bell of impending recession, he believes the economy is stronger than many are saying, and that the threat of recession is still a ways off.    &quot;We don't see a recession coming anytime soon; 1990 at the earliest,&quot; Mr. Salomon said. &quot;If the economy slows, it is more likely to occur later in 1989, and against that backdrop, we are likely to see some higher interest rates before then.&quot; He added, however, that the weakness in oil prices will take some pressure off rates.    Some oil stocks gained on the mild rebound in oil prices. Atlantic Richfield added 7/8 to 77 1/8, British Petroleum advanced 1/2 to 49 1/2 and Amoco was ahead 5/8 at 73. Oil stocks in the Dow Jones industrials were slower to pick up on the trend, however, with Exxon adding only 1/8 to 44 3/8, Texaco gaining 1/4 to 44 1/8 and Chevron rising 1/4 to 43 7/8.    Greyhound jumped 2 1/4 to 36 in active trading. A 300,000-share block was crossed by First Boston, sparking renewed rumors that Ronald Perelman or another potential hostile buyer might be interested in the company.    TW Services jumped 1 3/4 to 26 5/8 on over 1.9 million shares. The company received a $28-a-share merger proposal from SWT Associates. The company said it would respond &quot;in due course.&quot;    MCA Inc. surged 1 1/4 to 46 3/4 on rumors that it will be bought by Walt Disney Co. Neither company could be reached for comment. Disney slipped 3/8 to 64 1/4.    Circuit City jumped 1 5/8 to 42 5/8 after reporting that its September sales leapt 36% from a year ago.    Pillsbury slid 1/4 to 57 7/8 as Grand Metropolitan hit a snag in its takeover proposal. Grand Metropolitan's request that Pennsylvania dismiss a restraining order preventing it from acquiring Pillsbury stock was turned down. It faces similar restraining orders in six other states.    Digital Communications Associates dipped 1/4 to 23 3/4. On Wednesday, the company reported earnings below expectations for its first quarter, ended Sept. 30, saying it earned 47 cents a share in the quarter, compared to 59 cents a year ago. The company also announced plans to spend about $14 million in cash and stock to buy Digital Transmission Systems.    Redman Industries gained 1/2 to 9 5/8. The litigation blocking Wingate Partners' acquisition of Redman has been settled. On Tuesday, Redman's stock fell on fears that the $10-a-share offer would not go through. Meanwhile, Wingate extended the expiration of the offer to Oct. 18.    The American Stock Exchange Index rose 1.17 to 301.14. Amex volume totaled 11,640,000 shares, compared with 10 million Wednesday. There were 295 issues advancing in price, 253 declining and 308 unchanged.    Texas Air surged 1 1/4 to 16. Donald Trump confirmed he is negotiating to buy the Eastern Airlines unit's shuttle service. Sources said the price could be more than $300 million. Meanwhile, Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl Icahn held talks with Texas Air on the sale of all of Eastern Airlines to TWA, according to the Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. </TEXT></DOC>
