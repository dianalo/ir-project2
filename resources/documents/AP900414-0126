The New York Times reported in its Sunday editions thatofficials, not identified by the newspaper, said the inspectorgeneral determined there may be an appearance of favoritism in thecontract awards and that they should have been awarded throughcompetitive bidding.   ``I can't confirm or deny the story,'' said Nipp.   However, he said, ``The IG's report makes seven or eightrecommendations that this new federal agency should follow in thefuture.''   The investigation concerned nearly $200,000 in consultantcontracts granted by Mary K. Bush, acting director of the FederalHousing Finance Board, to Wendell Gunn, a former top aide toHousing Secretary Jack Kemp, and two former Treasury Departmentofficials, Margery Waxman and Kevin Coyne.   ``We are informed that the audit report does not find anystatutory or regulatory violation in the manner in which thesecontracts were let,'' Francis A. Keating, HUD general counsel, toldThe Times.   The White House earlier this month rejected Kemp's nomination ofMs. Bush, who is not related to President Bush, to head the agency,which was created as a part of the savings and loan bailout.   Keating refused to discuss details of the investigative reportwith the newspaper, but said ``it puts to rest any suggestion thatinappropriate conduct occurred.''   Kemp, however, ``is anxious in the future that there not even bethe appearance of inappropriate conduct,'' Keating said.   Nipp said the report will be made public in two or three days.   HUD was rocked last year by congressional investigationsuncovering widespread political favoritism in several federalhousing programs.   A congressional panel also has said it will investigate theFinance Board matter.</TEXT></DOC>
