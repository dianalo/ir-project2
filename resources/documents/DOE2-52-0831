The highest toughnesswas achieved with ZrO{sub 2}-CeO{sub 2} coatings which contained a significantproportion of transformable tetragonal phase. The results are interpretedin terms of the influence of grain size and composition of the tetragonalto monoclinic phase transformation. 10 references.</TEXT></DOC>
