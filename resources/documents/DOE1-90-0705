<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-90-0705 </DOCNO><TEXT>Lattice parameter of alloys of quasibinary cut Fe/sub 0/./sub 82-x/Cr/sub0/./sub 18/Ni/sub x/ (x=0.1-0.8) at 293 K is determined by roentgenostructuralmethod. Quantity analysis of this dependence is conducted within theframeworks of Weiss model. Relative and absolute configurations of ironatoms in two states ({gamma}1 and {gamma}2) with different electron configuration,as well as energy slot, dividing these states, are calculated. The obtainedparameters allowed to determine Curie temperature of these alloys.</TEXT></DOC>
