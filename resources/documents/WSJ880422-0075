Several government reports to be released over the next two weeks are expected to indicate whether the Federal Reserve will tighten credit further. Traders say they will focus especially on the employment report to be released May 6.    If that and other data show further evidence of economic strength and higher inflation, analysts say, the Fed will push interest rates slightly higher. Many also predict banks soon will raise their prime, or base, lending rate to 8 3/4% from 8 1/2%.    Short-term rates finished generally unchanged from Wednesday's levels. Corporate bond prices also were flat, while prices of long-term U.S. Treasury bonds drifted slightly lower in sluggish activity.    In the municipal bond market, prices of long-term issues generally held steady despite fears that individual investors might sell heavily in the wake of a Supreme Court decision Wednesday. The court ruled that Congress has the power to tax interest on municipal bonds.    &quot;I saw no reaction&quot; to the Supreme Court's decision, said Peter J.D. Gordon, a vice president at T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. in Baltimore and the head of 12 municipal funds. &quot;It was a very ho-hum day in the markets. Most of the discussions I've had have been with reporters, not with our shareholders or brokers.&quot;    Mr. Gordon and many other investment managers say that although Congress may enact limits on tax-exempt bond issuance, any changes probably would exempt bonds already issued. Most also say Congress is unlikely to consider eliminating the tax-exempt status of all municipal bonds.    &quot;We've been taking the pulse of the market very carefully, and it seems that it (the Supreme Court decision) didn't have much impact,&quot; said John E. Haupert, treasurer of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. &quot;Among the people we've spoken with, the feeling is almost unanimous that the shock of the decision wore off by Wednesday afternoon and that the market stabilized.&quot;    After the Supreme Court decision was announced, Port Authority officials considered postponing a $100 million bond sale scheduled for yesterday morning. But after seeing the market stabilize, they decided to proceed and received five competing bids from underwriters. The winning bidder was Glickenhaus andamp; Co.    &quot;We were very pleased with the results,&quot; Mr. Haupert said. &quot;Generally in the past, we've gotten four bids and been happy with it. This time, we got five.&quot; The true interest cost to the Port Authority on the bonds was 8.4256%, which he said &quot;is about what we had expected.&quot;    The bonds, which carry an interest rate of 8 1/4%, are due in 2023. They are rated double-A-minus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. and single-A-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. According to Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, Loews/CNA Holdings Inc. bought the entire issue. James Gammon, senior vice president of the company, said: &quot;Why not? I find this an advantageous time to own municipal bonds.&quot;    &quot;Market participants feel Congress won't do anything retroactively and that until Congress acts, business will continue as it has,&quot; Mr. Gordon of T. Rowe Price said.    This view was echoed by Seth Glickenhaus of Glickenhaus andamp; Co. &quot;It is extremely unlikely they (Congress) would make anything retroactive,&quot; he said. &quot;I feel fairly confident anything they do would be prospectively, rather than retroactively, which means that long-term, non-callable muni bonds would become like museum pieces and command Van Gogh-like prices.&quot;    But Mr. Glickenhaus also said it's difficult to predict congressional action.    The Port Authority bonds sold yesterday are expected to be used in connection with the Essex County Resource Recovery Facility being built in Newark, N.J., and for &quot;certain incidental purposes,&quot; according to a spokesman.    Separately, analysts say a government report to be released this morning on durable goods orders for March is likely to show a strong increase. According to the average estimate of a dozen economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, durable goods orders rose 1.3%. But these data are notoriously volatile from month to month, and estimates of the increase varied from 0.2% to 2.5%.    Here are details of yesterday's market activity:   --The price of the most actively traded long-term Treasury bond, the 8 7/8% bond due 2017, fell to 98 11/32 from 98 17/32 Wednesday. The yield rose to 9.04% from 9.02%.    --The price of the government's 8 1/8% note due 1998 declined to 95 18/32 from 95 19/32. The yield rose to 8.81% from 8.80%.    --Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds hovered in a narrow band all day, finishing 1.10 lower at 1244.84. The low was 1243.78, and the high was 1247.87.    --The rate on three-month Treasury bills rose to 5.84% bid from 5.82%, while the rate on the latest six-month bills was 6.23% bid, unchanged from late Wednesday. The rate on one-year bills inched up to 6.58% bid from 6.57%. </TEXT></DOC>
