With the ink barely dry on the 371-page rewrite of federalbanking laws, his administration began putting the plan intoeffect, approving the first $815 million installment for cleaningup the nation's most heavily indebted savings and loans.   Hours after the signing, the Resolution Trust Corp., the newfederal agency created to dispose of ailing thrifts, said it wasconsidering unilaterally reducing high interest rates on long-termcertificates issued by some of 262 insolvent but still open thriftinstitutions.   ``The bill is not perfect, but it is a first step, a crucialfirst step toward restoring public confidence,'' Bush said at aRose Garden bill-signing ceremony attended by the chief architectsof the legislation.   Bush said the overhaul _ the government's biggest-ever industrybailout _ will help ``ensure that not one dollar of insured fundswill be lost by any depositor.''   The legislation, a lightly modified version of the rescue planBush first submitted to Congress Feb. 6, authorizes $50 billion innew government borrowing over the next 26 months to clean up ailingSandamp;Ls, in part by buying up high-rate certificates of deposit issuedby the shaky thrifts to attract capital.   The measure requires Sandamp;L owners, within four months, to have$1.50 in tangible capital for every $100 in lending as a cushionbetween future losses and government insurance funds. By 1995, thestandard will tighten to $3 for each $100 in loans.   The overhaul also toughens criminal penalties for fraud andtriggers the most sweeping overhaul of the banking regulation in 50years.   This includes a dismantling of the primary Sandamp;L regulatoryagency, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Under the overhaul,federal deposit insurance for Sandamp;Ls will be provided by a newinsurance fund called the Savings Association Insurance Funds,SAIF, pronounced ``safe.''   Shortly after Bush signed the bill, Treasury Secretary NicholasBrady convened a meeting of the Resolution Trust Corp. OversightBoard, set up by the legislation to sell off sour loans andrepossessed real estate the government is inheriting from thefailed thrifts.   The board voted to spend $815 million as the first installmentin shutting down or merging Sandamp;Ls with the highest negative networths, including $215 million for dealing with three yet to beidentified insititutions on Thursday.   The government, which has already closed 223 Sandamp;Ls, is authorizedunder the legislation to shut down up to 500 more of the nation'snearly 3,000 institutions over three years. It is required to spend$20 billion over the next seven weeks alone on the problem.   Of that $20 billion, $15 billion will be used to replacedeposits lost to institutions as high-rate certificates, most with30-, 60- and 90-day terms and some paying up to 11 percentinterest, come due.   The Resolution Trust Corp. said those certificates could berenewed, but at interest rates up to 3 percentage points under whatthey are now earning, and expects some of the certificate money tobe withdrawn.   Unresolved is whether the corporation will continue to honor thehigh interest rates on longer-term certificates, as the bank boardhad.   At issue are long-term certificates issued by 262 institutionsthe federal government has already taken over but has not had themoney to redeem. Those institutions' high-rate certificates total$50 billion, but only a small portion of them are long-term,according to analysts.   The resolution corporation is expected to decide within the nextfew days how to honor the certificates.   Latest administration estimates put the total cost of thebailout at $159 billion through 1999.   Bush said the measure, which received final congressionalapproval Saturday, ``says to tens of millions of savings and loandepositors: you will not be the victims of others' mistakes.''   In a reference to the nearly foot-thick ``Financial InstitutionsReform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989'' resting on a tableawaiting his signature, Bush said, ``Thank you all very much and,now, I'm proud to sign this monster.''   Among the 300 or so people at the signing ceremony were TreasurySecretary Brady, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kempand key Capitol Hill backers of the legislation, including Sen.Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., and Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,chairmen of the congressional banking committees.   Riegle later told reporters, ``The bill deals with every majorproblem we were able to identify.'' He praised the administrationfor moving to put the plan into effect so quickly.   Some analysts expect that government buyouts and mergers withcommercial banks will leave only 1,000 or so savings and loansstill in business at the end of five years.   Bush said that the legislation ``comes to grips with theproblems facing our savings and loan industry. It will safeguardand stabilize America's financial system and put in place permanentreforms so these problems will never happen again.''   The bill includes punishments for fraud committed by officersand directors of financial institutions of up to $1 million a dayin fines and 20 years in prison.   ``Those who try and loot the savings of their fellow citizensdeserve, and will receive, swift and severe punishment,'' Bush said.</TEXT></DOC>
