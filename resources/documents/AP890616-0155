The People's Movement Against the EEC, which wants areferendum on Denmark's membership, lost at least 1 of its 4 seats,according to the polls. Other seats were scattered among variousparties and coalitions.   The Netherlands _ Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers and his ChristianDemocrats gained 1 seat for a total of 9 but their conservativecoalition partners lost 2 of their 5 seats and the Socialists heldall 9 seats.   Ireland _ It has 15 seats in the Parliament but the ballots arenot be counted until Sunday and the news media did not carrypredictions.   Polls indicated that when all of the elections are complete theSocialists, with 166 seats, will strengthen their dominant position.The centrist Christian Democrats hold 112 seats and also wereexpected to gain.   Green and environmental parties, with 20 seats, also should dowell, especially in West Germany and France.   Conservative parties were expected to suffer the losses.   Thursday's turnout generally was low, though turnouts for theEuropean Parliament usually are.   It was 35 percent in Britain, compared to 32.5 percent in 1984;the Netherlands 48 percent, down from 51 percent five years ago;Denmark dropped to 46 percent from 52.4 percent in 1984, and Spainrecorded 65 percent compared to 69 percent in 1987 when electionswere held there and in Portugal. The two nations joined the EEC in1986.   Polls have consistently shown that the Parliament's role in EECaffairs is largely unknown to most of the people in the 12 nations.   As a result, the election campaigns are dominated by nationalrather than pan-European issues.   The Parliament meets one week per month in Strasbourg.</TEXT></DOC>
