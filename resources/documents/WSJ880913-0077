Long seen as a premier defense contractor, Raytheon is guilty of only one major sin in Wall Street's view -- diversification. According to its critics, during a takeover binge that ended in 1980, Raytheon gained only mediocrity: frequent annual losses among the new units, disappointment with others, and diluted profitability overall.    Now, some analysts and investors predict that the Lexington, Mass., company will sell some of what it bought, in what would be a major strategic shift. Raytheon's management, which has long defended the diversifying, has given no hint of any such plans. But management is expected to change soon because Chairman Thomas L. Phillips and President R. Gene Shelley will both reach the company retirement age of 65 next year.    As chief executive for 20 years and president before that, Mr. Phillips has come to be equated with Raytheon's diversification, which was designed to blunt the effects of downturns in defense spending. With fresh blood in the executive suite, many Raytheon watchers believe that the laggard divisions Mr. Phillips acquired will no longer be sacrosanct.    Mr. Phillips declined to be interviewed for this story. But Harvey Brooks, a Harvard professor who is a Raytheon director, says &quot;there's an inherent probability that new management will take a look at everything,&quot; including how each operating unit &quot;is hitting across the board.&quot; In the board's view, Mr. Brooks adds, such a review would be desirable.    Dennis J. Picard, who heads the company's most important division, missiles, is widely seen as the frontrunning heir-apparent. &quot;I don't see how a guy like Dennis Picard can be denied,&quot; says Loren Korte, president of Raytheon's D.C. Heath andamp; Co. publishing unit. Mr. Picard fits the mold of Mr. Phillips and other defense engineers who have run Raytheon in the past. Internally, he also gets much credit for turning the Patriot air-defense missile into a mainstay after some early performance problems.    Patriot is one of many Raytheon defense successes in the 1980s. A big beneficiary of Pentagon efforts to increase competition, Raytheon has picked up a half-dozen profitable &quot;second-source&quot; or follow-on contracts to make missiles developed by other companies, while defending most of its own turf against such intrusions. Net income rose 83% to $445.1 million between 1984 and 1987 as defense masked weakness in other areas.    Raytheon denied a request for an interview with Mr. Picard. About succession, a Raytheon spokesman would say only that Mr. Phillips has submitted a list of possible chief executive candidates to a special search committee. The full board is expected to discuss the matter in January, leading to an announcement by March. Retirement ages aren't always enforced when it comes to chief executives, and there has been speculation that Mr. Phillips will be asked to stay on for a temporary period. Mr. Brooks, however, says he has &quot;heard no discussion&quot; of that possibility.    As the succession question looms, profits have continued to grow. In the 1988 first half, Raytheon reported earnings of $235.6 million, up 11% from a year ago. Sales grew 8.8% to $3.99 billion. These two quarters mark the first time since 1984 that the company made money in every operating area -- electronics, energy services, Beech airplanes, appliances and a fifth segment that is mainly Heath. From 1985 through 1987, Beech and energy posted operating losses of $42 million on $4.5 billion in sales. In the face of falling defense spending and worries about a recession, the company's order backlog from both government and the private sector continues to climb.    The change of fortunes outside defense may have vindicated the diversification strategy. &quot;I'd say it's made Tom Phillips look pretty good,&quot; says Mr. Korte. But it could also mean the biggest divestiture opportunity in years.    As long as Beech and energy were losing money, their potential selling prices may have carried a discount too deep for Raytheon to swallow. &quot;You can't sell things that are losing money,&quot; says analyst Christopher Demisch of First Boston. As Raytheon officials themselves have noted, acquirers in recent takeovers have paid premium prices for appliance and publishing companies.    &quot;I'd be shocked if {Raytheon} didn't sell something&quot; within the next year, says Joseph Day, a portfolio manager of aerospace stocks for Fidelity Investments, the largest investor in Raytheon's metropolitan area of Boston. &quot;It's one reason I'm holding the stock.&quot;    At least three brokerage-house analysts have made similar predictions in the last four months. One, Peter Aseritis of Primerica Corp.'s Smith Barney unit, said in a research report that he was &quot;virtually certain&quot; Raytheon would sell Beech and energy services by the end of 1989 unless the two units improve sharply. Michael Lauer, an analyst at Kidder Peabody, says he has received hints from Raytheon that it views its commercial electronics business as a sale candidate. Mr. Lauer figures that business produces $1 billion in sales a year.    Mr. Aseritis says he has no privileged information from anyone at Raytheon. But he says that some top officials, whom he wouldn't name, have in private questioned recently whether Raytheon's defense electronics specialty meshes well, or can be managed effectively, with the varied other operations. Mr. Day also says &quot;my impression in talking to the company is that they are considering&quot; asset sales. &quot;That's quite a difference from what they've been saying before.&quot;    Others familiar with Raytheon caution that change may not come quickly or be too dramatic. &quot;Analysts love to speculate,&quot; says James Walsh, who left Raytheon last year to become chairman of Wyman-Gordon Co. &quot;I personally doubt whether you'll see a major change.&quot;    Mr. Walsh, who ran Beech and was once regarded as a candidate for Raytheon's top post, also sees Mr. Picard as the probable successor. He says that while new managers will probably review all divisions, they may find Beech and energy &quot;coming out of the doldrums.&quot; While ejecting laggard divisions &quot;was always a discussion point&quot; within Raytheon, Mr. Walsh adds, optimism about their long-term prospects always prevailed. Mr. Picard or any other new chief executive, he says, will ultimately be guided by the individual profitability of each unit.    Last year, non-electronics operations generated 38% of Raytheon's $7.66 billion in revenue but only 14% of its operating profit. Mr. Aseritis figures the non-defense businesses collectively earn 5% to 6% of sales on a pretax basis, compared with 12% to 13% for the defense business.    Nancy Tooke, who follows Raytheon for Tucker, Anthony andamp; R.L. Day, says &quot;it's entirely possible that new management will look differently at the portfolio {of companies}, but it may not mean selling the failures but trading around -- selling and buying in various sectors.&quot;    Mr. Phillips has said that Raytheon might find opportunities to buy defense companies at attractive prices if Pentagon spending remains sluggish. But lately, Raytheon has preferred investing in its own stock. In the last four years, it bought back 20 million of its shares for $1.2 billion, and last month it announced its intention to buy another five million of its 66 million shares outstanding.    That strategy reflects Mr. Phillips's conservative management style and a desire to lift Raytheon's share price, in part to avoid becoming the target of a hostile takeover. But it also is a tacit admission that after so many acquisitions that went badly, Raytheon can find nothing better to spend its money on. It has been a company in a holding pattern.    Mr. Phillips &quot;has cleaned up the acquisitions, and everything is producing black ink now -- that may be his legacy,&quot; says Ms. Tooke. &quot;New management may look at some of these businesses and say we're at the top of a cycle, we think we can get a very fine price.&quot;    ---                        Raytheon Sales -           1987 by segment in millions of dollars Electronics (defense) ............................ $4,740 Appliances (Amana, Speed Queen, Caloric) ........... $905 Energy Services .................................... $776 Beech Aircraft ..................................... $699 Other lines (including D.C.
