Chevrolets raced off with two awards and two certificates in the Industrial Designers Society of America's annual design competition yesterday. That's a record for a single company in the history of the competition, and it should help counter GM's reputation for designing ho-hum automobiles.    Chevrolet's big winner, the Beretta, is GM's answer to Ford Motor Co.'s Taurus, which also won a belated IDSA certificate this year. Beretta won one award for the whole car and another for, of all things, its engine compartment.    Judges cited the sleekly aerodynamic Beretta for its &quot;beautiful lines and form&quot; and &quot;American personality.&quot; They noted that the design, by GM's staff, aims to enhance quality by using as few parts as possible to simplify assembly and minimize the chances of poor fit.    While an engine compartment may not be a thing of beauty, the Beretta's won for its tidy &quot;user-friendly&quot; layout, which judges said would make the car easier for an owner to service. Hoses and wires have been tucked away to avoid clutter, and fluid openings have been made large for easier filling, and placed for convenience. Oversized caps have big labels. The jurors called the design &quot;a real breakthrough.&quot;    Chevrolet also won certificates for its Full-Size C/K Pickup and Blazer XT-1.    Also on a winning streak: Powered Partners, a set of small, triangular speakers that pick up sound from another source and amplify it. The system, designed by Gregory Fossella Associates, Boston, for Teledyne Acoustic Research, a Canton, Mass, division of Teledyne Inc., won an IDSA award. It had already picked up a similar prize in ID Magazine's annual competition. IDSA said the design &quot;breaks away from boxes and cubes&quot; that are rampant in consumer electronics.    Still rolling: Esprit de Corp. design. Over the years, this privately held California concern, which describes itself as &quot;a lifestyle company&quot; (&quot;accessories, shoes, kids wear, clothing collections, bed and bath accessories and eyewear&quot;), has grabbed dozens of design awards for its exuberant store interiors, packaging, graphics and even store fixtures. This year a new Esprit shoe showroom by the San Francisco designer Michael Vanderbyl won ID Magazine's environments catagory, and next month the company will receive a design leadership award from the American Institute of Graphic Arts.    Be Seated...   Office workers who suffer wrenched backs and strained eyes may be the victims of improperly adjusted furniture. Furniture and office designers have known this for years, and today's office furniture is more adjustable than ever. But that doesn't help the majority of people, including those responsible for office health and safety, who haven't the faintest idea what the right adjustments are.    To meet this problem, Ergo Design Inc., an Englewood Cliffs, N.J., human factors consultant, has developed ErgoScale, a kit that lay people can use to take body measurements and translate them quickly to such settings as chair height, keyboard height and video-screen tilt.    ErgoScale already has critics, who say the device implies that there is only one correct group of settings for each worker, when studies show that a desk-bound worker should switch positions frequently during the day. Replies Peter Mitchell, president of Ergo Design: &quot;ErgoScale permits a range of positions. We think a worker can start from a theoretical 'best' position and then make minor adjustments until he or she is most comfortable. But we've seen so much furniture that's so far off that we feel something is needed to at least get them in the ballpark.&quot;    ...Or Not   On the other hand, Nathan Edelson thinks it's a mistake to make some office workers sit down at all.    Mr. Edelson, president of Active Office Systems, Silver Spring, Md., has spent the past five years refining a work station for employees who perform the most boring clerical tasks. It includes an adjustable desk, for sitting or standing, a treadmill and even a &quot;video window&quot; that plays tapes of, say, seashore scenes.    Mr. Edelson concedes that the extra cost of his &quot;active office&quot; -- about $2,000 -- puts employers off, but he notes that 25% to 30% of clerical workers quit each year because of ennui, stress and fatigue and he estimates that it costs more than $2,000 just to hire and retrain a replacement. &quot;Face it,&quot; he says, &quot;these jobs aren't going to get more interesting. Let's give these people a work environment where they can enjoy themselves.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
