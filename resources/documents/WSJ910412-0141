The KabiPharmacia AB unit of Swedish conglomerateProcordia AB and AB Astra have pitted their versions ofstreptokinase, a 30-year-old drug widely used in Europe todissolve blood clots, against expensive, new geneticallyengineered clot dissolvers. The new drugs -- versions of anatural clot-dissolving protein called TPA -- were developedby Genentech Inc. and SmithKline Beecham Corp. So far,Genentech's version, called Activase, has dominated the U.S.market for clot dissolvers, generating sales of $220 millionlast year compared with only a few million dollars forstreptokinase.</LP><TEXT>   But that huge lead was jolted in recent months by severalclinical studies that found streptokinase as effective as TPAin prolonging life after a heart attack. Other studies showedSmithKline Beecham's Eminase works as well as the other two.The prices of the three drugs differ greatly. A dose ofGenentech's gene-spliced TPA costs about $2,200 -- 10 timesmore than streptokinase. Eminase sells for about $1,700 adose.   Genentech has disputed the trials' methods and certainconclusions drawn from the head-to-head comparisons of itsdrug with streptokinase. Yet given the intense pressure forcost containment in the U.S. medical system, some analystsexpect the lack of a clear victory for TPA to drive somedoctors to the less expensive drug.   That's certainly the hope of KabiPharmacia, whichdeveloped its version of streptokinase, Kabikinase, in the1960s and claims to hold about half the European market forstreptokinase. Astra, Scandinavia's No. 1 drug company,joined the fray more recently by quietly acquiring U.S.rights to streptokinase from Germany's Hoechst AG early thisyear. The move underlines Astra's aggressive attempt toexpand its U.S.-based sales force.   KabiPharmacia and Astra don't expect to topple Genentechfrom its top perch in the U.S. any time soon. &quot;The clinicaltrials were important, but it would take enormous marketingmuscle to beat a product like Genentech's. The strongpositioning and high price give them plenty of money toinvest in aggressive marketing,&quot; said Tommie Johansson,KabiPharmacia's marketing manager for cardiovascularproducts.   Most industry analysts doubt that the Swedish companiescould muster anything close to the marketing clout needed toshake Genentech. &quot;This is a market waiting for more impetus.And the onus remains on SmithKline Beecham to shake the{Genentech} castle and possibly help streptokinase in theprocess,&quot; said John Reeve, a London-based drug analyst forDaiwa Securities Co.   Mr. Johansson said KabiPharmacia doesn't plan to build upa big sales force to market its version of streptokinase. Butin some ways, the outlook for increasing profit in the U.S.has already brightened, the executive added.   KabiPharmacia virtually halted U.S. marketing ofKabikinase in recent years following a failed attempt tolicense the product. Company officials complained thataggressive price discounting by Hoechst wiped out alreadyslim profit margins on modest sales volume.   But according to Mr. Johansson, Astra already has raisedthe price of a streptokinase treatment to about $300 a dose.That has allowed KabiPharmacia to increase the price ofKabikinase to roughly the same level, he added, fatteningprofit margins.   Astra's entry in the clot-dissolving sweepstakes is thelatest in a flurry of moves to strengthen its U.S. salesforce. The buildup has stirred intense speculation aboutpossible friction between Astra and U.S. ally Merck andamp; Co.   Under terms of a 1983 agreement, Merck holds U.S. rightsto a dozen of Astra's most promising research products --including the blockbuster anti-ulcer drug Losec. The accordcalls for formation of a joint-venture marketing company ifsales reached a certain, undisclosed level by a certain date,generally believed to be 1993.   Yet Astra and Merck still haven't reached agreement aboutvarious adjustments the Swedes are seeking in the originaljoint-venture accord. And buoyed by Losec's booming salesaround the world, Astra Chief Executive Hakan Mogren hasadopted a tougher tack lately when discussing relations withMerck and other licensees.   At an analysts' meeting in late February, Mr. Mogren saidthat talks with Merck must be concluded by the middle of nextyear. He also stressed that assuming full responsibility forU.S. marketing of Astra products was one possible option -- amove that would require rapid expansion of the company'ssales organization in the U.S.   To that end, Astra has begun clinical trials of severalsuccessful respiratory drugs aiming for a U.S. market launchwithin two to three years. The respiratory products aren'tincluded in the Merck accord.</TEXT></DOC>
