Gasification in a circulating fluidizedbed at a variety of coal/oil shale ratios, temperatures and steam flowrates was undertaken. Although problems were identified, results indicatedthe calorific value of the gas produced was much lower than values reportedfor the gasification of coal with air. 6 refs., 10 tabs., 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
