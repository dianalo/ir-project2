Gorbachevon Monday proposed ecological cooperation with West Germany thatwould include exchanges of technology and emergency assistance incase of an environmental disaster.   Speaking at a dinner given by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,Gorbachev said the ``scientific-technical and economic possibilitiesof the U.S.S.R. and West Germany would have a huge meaning'' inEurope's effort to combat pollution.   Any agreement would more directly benefit the Soviet Union's newecology program than the well-established West German effort.   The Soviets' environmental protection agency was created onlylast year and still lacks the finances and many of the powers itneeds to crack down on polluters.   Soviet officials said last month they were finishing acomprehensive environmental protection package but they were stillworking out technical options for factories to reduce effluence.   Gorbachev suggested the Soviets and West Germany could conductresearch to develop joint ventures to build pollution controlequipment, process wastes, exchange information between regions andcities in the two countries, agree on a program of urgent aid incase of accidents and develop working groups to help form anall-Europe environmental policy.   Gorbachev praised the efforts of French President FrancoisMitterrand, and West Germany's opposition Social Democrats andGreens parties to work out international environmental agreements.He did not mention Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, which has beenslower to formulate environmental protection policies.   Thousands of Soviet citizens have participated in demonstrationsprotesting decades of rushed industrial production that ignoredenvironmental consequences.   Soviet officials have said 50 million people live in cities whereair pollution sometimes exceeds acceptable limits by 10 times andthe country's main waterways are dying because of the dumping ofindustrial wastes.   Environmental activists say overuse of pesticides and chemicalfertilizers are poisoning the food Soviets eat.   Gorbachev and other government leaders were criticized repeatedlyon the ecology issue by parliamentarians during the Congress ofPeople's Deputies session that ended Friday.   Germans are concerned about Soviet environmental policies,especially after the April 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power-plantdisaster. The explosion and fire at the Chernobyl plant in thenorthern Ukraine killed at least 31 people and released a cloud ofradiation that spread around the world.</TEXT></DOC>
