Near the cityof Hutchinson, the salt has a gross thickness of 350 feet, includingshale and anhydrite interbeds totaling 20 percent of the section, ora net of 280 feet of rock salt (mineralogically halite, chemically NaCl)of variable purity. It is there encountered near 400 feet, but elsewhereat depths ranging from 200 feet to over 2500 feet. Within Kansas, themargins of the Hutchinson Salt are depositional edges except for theupdip east edge which is solution eroded due to access to the Pleistoceneand present water tables. West of this natural erosion border, thereare no instances of dissolution of the Hutchinson Salt prior to man'sdrilling test holes for oil or salt during the past 88 years, the inadvertenteffects of which are the 13 subsidence areas described in this paper,five associated with the mining of salt, and eight resulting from oiland gas operations. 44 refs., 37 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
