<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-08-0165 </DOCNO><TEXT>The scattering amplitude from a strongly absorbing potential, perturbedby a parity-dependent term, is evaluated in a semi-classical limit. Theperturbation causes the appearance of contributions from a new classof generalized trajectories in which sudden reversions of the relativeposition vector appear along the unperturbed trajectories. The contributionsfrom these trajectories closely resemble those corresponding to trajectoriesrefracted in the internal region.</TEXT></DOC>
