The antagonists in this battle are U.S. tobacco companies givingfree cigarettes to U.S. forces stationed in the gulf vs.anti-smoking groups who say the giveaways are a ploy to hook a newgeneration of soldiers.   Philip Morris U.S.A., the nation's leading cigarette maker, saidTuesday it had donated 2 million smokes to Operation Desert Shieldin response to letters from tobacco-deprived soldiers.   Larry Glennie, company director of military specialty sales,said Philip Morris had shipped the 10,000 cartons of Marlboros toSaudi Arabia on Sept. 26. They were distributed free to ``membersof the Army, Air Force and Marines who have the least access to thebasic comforts of everyday life,'' he said.   The shipment followed a Sept. 25 announcement by the muchsmaller Brown andamp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. that it planned to send anundisclosed number of free Kool Milds and Richlands to the U.S.contingent defending oil-rich Saudi Arabia against a possible Iraqiattack.   Smoking critics said the moves subverted a 4-year-old DefenseDepartment health policy aimed at discouraging cigarette use.   ``As health organizations, we certainly have to be concernedabout the readiness of our troops,'' said Fran DuMelle, chairwomanof the Coalition on Smoking or Health, a Washington lobby group.   ``I think the coalition is principally outraged at the tobaccoindustry's attempt to exploit the situation in the Mideast,'' shesaid. ``In every war in the last 40 years, the industry has usedthe concept of free cigarettes to hook a new generation ofsmokers.''   Steven Dickinson, a spokesman for the American Cancer Society,said he wasn't surprised by the giveaways, but questioned why thePentagon hadn't taken a public position on the free smokes.   ``The point is, the Department of Defense has recognized thatsmoking is a deterrent to fitness. Here they are playing into thetobacco companies,'' Dickinson said.   At the Pentagon, Defense Department spokesman Maj. Douglas Hartsaid he would have to check further before he could comment on thetobacco company announcements.   ``This is the first I've heard about this, to tell you thetruth,'' Hart said.   It was unclear whether the free cigarettes violated thePentagon's anti-smoking policy, which was begun in 1986 bythen-Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger.   The policy restricts where soldiers may smoke and subjectsrecruits to an aggressive educational campaign to discourage themfrom smoking because of what medical authorities have called theextreme health risks, which include cancer.   Glennie said Philip Morris had received a number of lettersrequesting cigarettes from troops in Operation Desert Shield.   ``They were having trouble getting cigarettes,'' Glennie said.He rejected the anti-smoking lobby's criticism.   ``I don't think there's anything we do that we don't getcriticzed for,'' he said. ``The company felt that since we'dgotten the letters directly from the front-line troops, we thoughtit was the right thing to do.''   A Philip Morris press statement quoted one unidentified letterfrom a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne division as saying, ``Weare not greedy people, just paratroopers unable to get hold ofgreat cigarettes. So any cigarettes you could send us would makeour stay here much more pleasurable.''   Another soldier was quoted as saying, ``We came over here withhardly any notice and most of us are out of tobacco and tired.''   Philip Morris U.S.A. is part of Philip Morris Companies Inc.,the world's largest consumer products company, based in New York.Besides its cigarette brands, which include Marlboro and Benson andamp;Hedges, the company sells items ranging from Miller beer to MaxwellHouse coffee to Velveeta cheese spread.</TEXT></DOC>
