Rumors were whipping through the industry that the U.S. Customs Service was about to slap an embargo on cotton coats from China, and nearly his entire fall shipment was sitting on the docks.    His anxiety soon turned to rage. Mr. Gallo, vice president of New York-based Saxton Hall Inc., learned that a government computer error in fact had caused the immediate closing of the quota on Chinese-made cotton coats. The result: On May 29, Mr. Gallo's goods along with those of about 20 other importers were embargoed, with potential losses estimated at $40 million.    The &quot;quota massacre,&quot; as some are calling it, began as an administrative foul-up, but quickly ballooned into a trade conflict with China. The U.S. -- in an apparent effort to deflect responsibility for the slip-up and under protectionist pressure -- contends that China's notorious overshipments of textiles laid the groundwork for the embargo. The Chinese, for their part, are seeking to minimize repercussions from both the importers and the U.S. government.    The importers, meanwhile, find themselves in the middle of a dispute they had no part in making. &quot;There's an old African saying that goes: 'When elephants fight it's the grass that suffers,'&quot; says the importers' attorney, Peter Suchman of Sharretts, Paley, Carter and Blauvelt in Washington, D.C. &quot;These importers are just getting trampled.&quot;    The controversy erupted after customs discovered its computer had failed to log about 3.3 million coats imported from China in 1986. As soon as the error was discovered, the agency applied the unrecorded units against this year's quota. The massive correction instantly consumed the 1987 allotment.    After intense lobbying by the American Association of Exporters and Importers, the government offered a measure of relief by shifting some unused quotas into the closed category and promising to make another small adjustment soon. But it refuses to take further steps to permit entry of the remaining million coats, which have an estimated retail value of $160 million.    Ron Levin, acting director of the Commerce Department's Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements, says the U.S. has exhausted all remedies under its existing pact with China. Borrowing from next year's quota isn't possible because China and the U.S. haven't concluded a 1988 agreement.    But Gene Milosh, president of the 1,200-member Exporters and Importers Association, says the Chinese are offering a solution. After considerable pressure from the organization's 300 textile and apparel members, Mr. Milosh says, China sent a textile delegation to Washington two weeks ago. The delegation reportedly requested a modification of the current agreement. Under the proposed special adjustment, the quota for cotton coats would be expanded by further limiting quotas in other categories.    Mr. Levin denied knowledge of the Chinese proposal and insisted that any further U.S. action must await the outcome of negotiations on next year's overall trade agreement. Those discussions, involving a separate Chinese delegation, resumed late last month.    The U.S. government's position has hardened because of growing impatience with Chinese overshipments. The cotton-coat embargo is just one of 27 the U.S. has imposed on Chinese textile imports this year because quotas have been exhausted.    &quot;It's been a mess with China,&quot; says Diane Solkoff, a trade specialist with the international agreements and monitoring division of the Commerce Department. &quot;It's been one embargo after another.&quot; Reasons for the excess shipments range from inadequate record-keeping to the issuing of fraudulent export visas by the Chinese.    The computer error couldn't have come at a worse time, the importers say. Faced with mounting pressure from domestic textile manufacturers, Washington is moving increasingly toward a crackdown on imports.    A prime target is China, which became the country's No. 1 supplier of textiles in 1986, up from No. 4 in 1985. About one-quarter of all Chinese textile exports went to the U.S. last year, a 63% increase from the previous year. Overall textile exports accounted for one-quarter of China's total exports of $30 billion in 1986. China recently reported that textile exports in the first half of 1987 totaled $4.39 billion, up 30% from the previous year.    &quot;This (dispute) will have to be resolved in the larger context of the rapid growth of imports from China,&quot; says a congressional aide specializing in trade issues.    At the heart of the political debate is the impact of textile imports on U.S. manufacturers. &quot;Everyone (in government) is looking over their shoulder,&quot; says Mr. Milosh. &quot;They have to answer to the domestic industry.&quot; But, he adds, the U.S. should accept that the decline of its apparel output is permanent. In addition to being uneconomical, Mr. Milosh says, the industry can no longer attract workers when the service sector offers equal pay and better conditions.    A debate also continues to rage over the mix-up in the government numbers, with each side pointing the finger at the other.    John O'Loughlin, director of the office of trade operations at the Customs Service, insists the importers must have known the figures provided by his division were incorrect. &quot;They had to know they were getting quantities in that category they had no right to expect,&quot; he says.    That suggestion rankles importers and trade analysts alike. Clint Stack, president of International Development Systems Inc., a Washington, D.C.-based textile consulting firm, argues the agency's statistics led importers to conclude that coat shipments from China were weak. He points out that the figures (before the error was discovered) showed that a substantial portion of the quota on cotton coats went unused in 1986 and, by May 29 of this year, only 30% of the 1987 allotment of 3.7 million units had been consumed.    &quot;This led importers to feel secure,&quot; Mr. Stack says. &quot;Most categories from China were making people nervous because they were closing so fast. But this was not one of them. I don't think the importers were taking advantage of the situation knowingly. They found a quota that was open, so they went out and purchased coats.&quot;    However, Mr. O'Loughlin sees a different motive. &quot;They bet against us,&quot; he says of the importers. &quot;They bet we weren't going to catch (the error). And we did.&quot;    Mr. Milosh of the Exporters and Importers Association explains that the importers had no way of suspecting the numbers were larger because, as competitors, they don't share information. He says the importers must rely on customs statistics in planning strategies, adding: &quot;There are no other figures that matter.&quot;    The Commerce Department's Ms. Solkoff asserts that the importers should have checked customs figures against those compiled by the Census Bureau. &quot;Other government figures are available,&quot; she says, &quot;and as prudent businessmen they should have used them.&quot;    But even Mr. O'Loughlin of customs concedes that census data is computed too slowly for use by importers. &quot;If you're trying to track a quota,&quot; he says, &quot;you can't use census numbers. You have to get that from us.&quot;    And there's the rub. &quot;The fact the importers were getting erroneous information from customs is not their fault,&quot; says the congressional aide. &quot;But they're the ones who suffer.&quot;    The importers say time is running out for them. &quot;I have hundreds of thousands of goods at the docks embargoed. Millions of dollars,&quot; says Richard Levy, vice president of Mod-Maid Imports Co. in New York. &quot;If we don't deliver (this month), we might as well take the goods and throw them in the garbage. Our industry is so seasonal the merchandise is worthless later.&quot;    Mr. Suchman, the attorney, says he may be forced to seek an injunction ordering the U.S. to permit entry of the goods. The court action, he says, would &quot;be based on the theory the importers had a right to rely on information published by the U.S. government.&quot; But, Mr. Suchman adds that the moment may not be propitious: &quot;With the atmosphere that exists in Washington, you don't get a lot of sympathy as an importer.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
