These immune cells can identify anddestroy cells infected with parasites or virus.;    Previous attempts at avaccine focused only on increasing antibodies to malaria, which the newvaccine also accomplishes.;    The immune killer cells act as a second line ofdefense for the immune system, backing up antibodies that seek out infectiousorganisms.;    &quot;It is a very fine piece of work, which explains both theirsuccess and our past failures in the vaccine area,&quot; said Dr. James Jensen, amalaria expert at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. &quot;If it extrapolatesto humans -- and there is some evidence that it will -- it is a majoradvance.&quot;;    The mouse vaccination technique is not immediately applicable tohumans, but the same types of immune cells and molecules probably areinvolved.;    'Promising' for humans;    &quot;The mouse system has predicted allalong what we have been able to achieve in humans and given us clues, so Ithink this is very promising for the prospects of a human vaccine,&quot; said Dr.Steven L. Hoffman, head of the malaria branch at the Naval Medical ResearchInstitute in Rockville, Md., an author of the new report.;    But otherexperts urged caution. &quot;This is important science, but it's not clear if itwill translate into a vaccine for humans,&quot; said Dr. Louis Miller, head of theparasitology laboratory at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md.;   Malaria is caused by a parasite that is spread by mosquitoes. Worldwide,one million to two million children die of malaria each year, and there are270 million new infections, mostly in the tropics.;    Until recently it wasnot known for certain if the immune killer cells evoked by the new vaccinewere involved in the immune system's battle with malaria.;    But last yearscientists found that these killer cells were active in making mice immune tomalaria.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910503  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  446  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday May 3, 199100124099,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
