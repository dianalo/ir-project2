The Integrated Reactor Operator/System (INTEROPS) prototypemodel was developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to demonstratethe feasibility of dynamically integrating a cognitive operator modeland a continuous plant process model (ARIES-P) to provide predictionsof the total response of a nuclear power plant during upset/emergencyconditions. The model consists of a SAINT network of cognitive tasksenhanced with expertise provided by a knowledge-based fault diagnosismodel. The INTEROPS prototype has been implemented in both closed andopen loop modes. The prototype model is shown to be cognitively relevantby accounting for cognitive tunneling, confirmation bias, evidence chunking,intentional error, and forgetting.</TEXT></DOC>
