One clot-dissolver, tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, is rumored to be close to market approval by the Food and Drug Administration. There is some evidence it is more effective on clots than streptokinase, which is already in use but was approved last week for a less complicated treatment. TPA's cost, however, is expected to be more than 10 times that of streptokinase.    Both melt blood clots believed responsible for many of the 1.5 million heart attacks that occur annually in the U.S. TPA reopened clogged arteries twice as often in a comparative study of the two drugs, but streptokinase, an older drug, has amassed more data documenting improved patient survival in a study involving more than 11,000 patients.    Perhaps the most striking contrast, however, is a tenfold price difference. Streptokinase costs less than $200 per course of therapy. TPA is expected to top $2,000. Such a premium leads some analysts to question whether the market will deem TPA -- even with better clot-dissolving ability -- to be worth 10 times the price of the older drug.    Streptokinase is marketed under the name Streptase by Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Somerville, N.J., a U.S. unit of Hoechst AG Group of Frankfurt, West Germany. The company is holding a news conference today to discuss the drug's approval in the U.S. last Friday and declare its virtues. Although the drug has been available in the U.S. since 1977 in the form of a delicate intracoronary injection, the FDA approval was for a faster, simpler intravenous administration, which could potentially broaden its use. Another vendor, SmithKline Beckman Corp. recently signed an agreement for the U.S. marketing of streptokinase produced by KabiVitrum AB of Sweden.    Genentech Inc., rebuffed by an FDA advisory panel in May, has submitted more data on TPA's safety and on heart function and survival. As previously reported, FDA Commissioner Frank Young has told drug trade groups a decision on the drug is imminent.    The current total U.S. market for clot-dissolving drugs is estimated at just $20 million to $30 million a year, including streptokinase and Abbott Laboratories' urokinase. In light of the so-far modest acceptance of the drugs, some analysts question whether TPA will zoom to the $1 billion sales level predicted by its boosters. Others believe the emerging volumes of data concerning the benefit to patients of these drugs will ignite the market.    But analysts are divided on the critical question of whether the market for life-saving heart attack drugs will be moved by matters of price.    &quot;High price may slow (TPA's) initial impact,&quot; said Sarah Gordon, an analyst with Hambrecht andamp; Quist in New York city. &quot;TPA is a good product and if I had a heart attack, I'd want it. But I don't think it'll be a billion-dollar product.&quot; Instead, she forecasted &quot;half that, world-wide,&quot; in sales.    &quot;Price isn't going to be a factor, except with Medicare and Medicaid patients,&quot; said Steven Gerber, an analyst with L.H. Friend in Los Angeles. Only in the case of such federally assisted patients will hospital administrators, now limited in the total they can collect in expenses per diagnosis, be likely to veto such an expensive treatment. &quot;They may ding it,&quot; he said.    Asked whether the market will value TPA as 10 times better than Streptase, Patrick McMorrow, product manager at Hoechst-Roussel, said: &quot;We hope not. We don't know what their (FDA-approved) label will say. If they can't claim improved survival, I don't see why people would prefer it.&quot; He added that opening the clot sometimes is only a passing benefit, and in any case it's only part of the therapeutic task physicians face in treating heart attack.    On the other hand, M. Kathleeen Behrens, an analyst with Robertson Colman andamp; Stephens in San Francisco, said she believes &quot;some will (pay the premium), because there are some cardiologists who believe that the blood clot is responsible for heart attacks. And in the only study that compared the two, TPA was twice as effective&quot; in dissolving them, Ms. Behrens said.    In South San Francisco, a spokeswoman for Genentech declined to comment on possible price competition, saying: &quot;We haven't finalized our pricing.&quot; However, the company's product, recently approved for sale in West Germany by Boehringer Ingelheim G.m.b.)H, is priced at about $2,375. U.S. analysts expect roughly comparable pricing here. </TEXT></DOC>
