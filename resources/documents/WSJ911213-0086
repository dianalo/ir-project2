The CIA has been tracking the spread of weapons of massdestruction more closely in the last few years, but now willmake the issue a &quot;much higher priority,&quot; Robert Gates, thenew director of central intelligence, said in an interview.</LP><TEXT>   Among other things, Mr. Gates said, the Americanintelligence community now plans to use the system itdeveloped to identify violators of economic sanctions againstIraq to pinpoint which countries or companies are secretlyaiding any country in the development of nuclear, chemicaland biological weapons. In the course of the showdown withIraq, Mr. Gates disclosed, the U.S. used intelligence it hadgathered to make more than 1,000 private appeals to othercountries, asking them to stop specific shipments of bannedgoods to Iraq.   &quot;We got to the point where we were not just identifyingthe countries that were involved in violations of thesanctions, but companies and even individuals,&quot; Mr. Gatessaid. He added that the U.S. developed an understanding ofsome of those networks, which &quot;parallel some of thoseinvolved in proliferation, or are in some cases the samekinds of people, the same companies.&quot;   Mr. Gates, a 25-year CIA veteran who was sworn in asdirector last month after stormy confirmation hearings,called proliferation the &quot;most important&quot; of a handful ofintelligence problems that now require more CIA attention inthe wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union.   The other problems include terrorism and narcoticstrafficking. The narcotics problem, in particular, couldworsen as confusion increases and border controls decrease inthe Central Asian republics that are spinning away from theformer Soviet Union.   The collapse of the Soviet Union, a nation that had nearly30,000 nuclear weapons, also has markedly increased theconcern about nuclear proliferation. Mr. Gates said that atthis point, American intelligence services don't know of anycases of Soviet nuclear weapons, nuclear materials or nuclearscientists moving to countries trying to covertly developnuclear weapons.   &quot;We have picked up rumors and stories, but nothing that Iwould call evidence,&quot; he said. &quot;We don't have anyconfirmation of any of that.&quot;   But in general, Mr. Gates told Congress this week that theCIA expects chemically armed missiles to become &quot;widespread&quot;from North Africa through South Asia this decade, and that &quot;anumber of countries&quot; also could field missiles with nuclearwarheads. American analysts are most worried about thenuclear program of North Korea, but also are closely watchingcountries such as Iraq, Iran and Algeria. China appearsparticularly active in helping such countries acquire nucleartechnology.   While diverting more CIA resources to fighting nuclearproliferation, Mr. Gates also acknowledges he is going tohave to make some painful choices about where to cut back, asthe intelligence budget is sliced in response to the end ofthe U.S.-Soviet global rivalry. CIA plans already anticipatea 15% reduction in manpower in the next few years, mostlythrough attrition, he said. And projections call for a cut inthe budget of the intelligence community -- which includesthe CIA and numerous other intelligence offices in otheragencies -- by billions of dollars in coming years.   To better cope, Mr. Gates and President Bush have launcheda far-reaching effort to rethink the way the intelligencecommunity works. Government departments and agencies arepreparing statements of their intelligence needs in thepost-Cold War era, and Mr. Gates is to recommend by March aplan for reshaping the intelligence community.   One area in which the CIA is being pressed by someanalysts and lawmakers to expand its efforts in economicintelligence, in an effort to help the U.S. fare better inthe competitive global marketplace of the 1990s.   But Mr. Gates, like other top CIA officials, is cool tothe idea. He said he sees little need for the agency to useits resources duplicating work already done by the Treasuryand the Federal Reserve in analyzing global macroeconomictrends. And he asserted that the CIA would find itselfentangled in a morass of legal problems and ethical questionsabout which businesses to help if it began engaging innarrower commercial espionage. &quot;Down that path lies peril forthe {intelligence} community,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
