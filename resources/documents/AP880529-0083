LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rawlings Sporting Goods Co. has announced thatit is getting out of the football helmet business, citing increasedliability and ``skyrocketing'' insurance costs.   The company will continue to manufacture football equipment fromthe neck down and will also continue to make non-competitivereplica helmets, Rawlings spokesman M. Scott Smith said Friday.   Rawlings' departure from the helmet business leaves only twomajor U.S. manufacturers _ Riddell Sporting Goods Inc. of Chicagoand A.H.I. Corp. of Litchfield, Ill., Smith said.   ``Rawlings has explored options to make it practical andprofitable to remain in the helmet business, but can no longerjustify the manufacture of competitive football helmets,'' Smithsaid.   Litigation involving head and neck injuries was the major factorin the decision, Smith said. In the past 15 years there have beenabout 25 helmet liability cases tried in court and verdicts havebeen granted totaling around $46 million, he said.   Since 1980, the total has been $39 million.
