The main alternative offered by the Bank Board would over four years whittle away the assessments for thrifts whose capital exceeded 6% of their assets. That currently would include about 1,400 of the nation's 3,126 thrift institutions insured by the board's Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the Bank Board said.    The board also invited comment on whether to use another threshold or a sliding scale that would reduce assessments for stronger thrifts.    The proposal, which had been promised, is intended to limit the incentive for thrifts to drop insurance by the FSLIC in favor of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which currently charges lower premiums. The FDIC sets 6% as the minimum capital level for savings institutions seeking its insurance coverage.    The Bank Board initiative also would introduce the concept that the greatest insurance premiums should be paid by the thrifts that pose the greatest risk of loss to the insurer.    The move was expected to widen the industry rift between strong thrifts that support the plan and weaker ones that oppose it.    William O'Connell, president of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the largest Sandamp;L trade group, charged previously that the Bank Board lacks authority to vary the assessments according to capital. A league spokesman declined to comment yesterday.    The proposal was heartily endorsed, meanwhile, by Charles John Koch, chairman-elect of the National Council of Savings Institutions, a smaller thrift group dominated by well-capitalized, FDIC-insured savings banks. Mr. Koch, president and chief executive officer of FSLIC-insured First Federal Savings Bank, Cleveland, said the proposal could stem a flight of many well-off thrifts to the FDIC after a moratorium on insurer switches expires Aug. 10.    The special assessment on FSLIC-insured institutions is 1/8th of 1%, in addition to the basic insurance premium on banks and thrifts of 1/12th of 1% annually. The surcharge, in effect since 1985, is deeply resented by many thrift executives.    Congress passed a bill last year calling for the special assessment to shrink annually until eliminated in 1992. However, the Bank Board has barred the reduction for the past two quarters on the ground that the troubled FSLIC needs the money.    The Bank Board's main proposal would trim the assessment on well-capitalized thrifts as recommended by the 1987 law. It would cut their surcharge to 1/12th of 1% this year, 1/16th of 1% next year, 1/24th of 1% in 1990, and 1/48th of 1% in 1991.    Other thrifts would continue to pay the 1/8th of 1% surcharge as long as the Bank Board certifies that this is needed.    Executives at many of the nation's biggest thrifts support the Bank Board's proposal, including many who have sought to switch to the FDIC.    &quot;Creating variable-rate premiums is sane policy and essential for the industry's survival,&quot; said Robert F. Adelizzi, president of Home Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association of San Diego, Calif. &quot;While there's some question as to the legality of the board's ability to make a unilateral decision about variable-rate premiums, we'd urge it to seek Congressional approval.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
