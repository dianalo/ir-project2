Taylor (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> WNEWS GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK </IN><G> CNG </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The House Banking Committee staff charged that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's asset disposition arm is a costly failure that is continuing to sap the board's insurance fund.    The report, published in the Congressional Record for Thursday, called for dissolution of the quasi-private Federal Asset Disposition Association, which was formed late in 1985 with $25 million in Bank Board funds to help it manage and sell the assets of failed thrifts. The report branded the disposition arm as &quot;an organization out of control&quot; that is ineffective, costly, secretive and laden with conflicts of interest.    Although the committee completed the report in early March, Chairman Fernand St Germain (D., R.I.) held it back until he could obtain approval for publishing it from Republican committee members.    The disposition association announced Friday that William F. McKenna had resigned March 31 as a director and chairman to give the current Bank Board the opportunity to pick its own candidate for those jobs. Gerald Carmen, president and chief executive officer of the association, said the resignation was unrelated to the committee report.    A spokesman for the Bank Board said the unit's weaknesses have largely been fixed. &quot;We think it's starting to come around,&quot; said spokesman Karl Hoyle.    The association has had a troubled and controversial start. Since its founding, it has had a loss of about $15 million while provoking lawmakers' ire for its management policies, steep costs and what they consider inflated salaries. In 1986, Mr. Carmen's predecessor, Roslyn Payne, who resigned under fire late last year, earned $250,000 plus a $75,000 bonus.    In a cover letter to the report, Rep. St Germain also charged that the organization serves the interests of a small elite group of savings and loan industry executives.    The report said it found that &quot;policies and procedures were ignored. Sole-source contracts were awarded to former business associates. Quality performance was nearly nonexistent.&quot;    The report charged that a new contract with the Bank Board will increase the disposition association's drain on the Board's funds. The contract, signed earlier this year, increases what the board pays the association to handle certain dispositions. Under the new contract, for instance, the association's fee for handling the assets from the failed Vernon Savings andamp; Loan, Vernon, Texas, will more than double to $27.3 million over five years from $10.4 million, the report said.    The Bank Board's Mr. Hoyle said the board has boosted payments to all companies that manage and dispose of the assets of its Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.'s receiverships. He said prior contracts didn't pay enough. The disposition arm, he added, now works under the same terms as other asset management firms hired by the FSLIC.    According to Mr. Carmen, the association has trimmed its payroll and top salaries and is striving to increase its efficiency. Mr. Hoyle said, &quot;We're trying to see if it (the association) can work in the manner in which it was designed to work.&quot;    The report detailed a host of alleged conflicts of interest of former association officials. In one new disclosure, it said the association paid more than $650,000 for asset disposition to ConAm Corp. of San Diego, among whose founders are the owners of Korn/Ferry International, the executive search firm that recommended Ms. Payne for the top association job.    Mr. Hoyle said, &quot;I don't think there was any conflict there.&quot; Neither Ms. Payne nor Korn/Ferry officers could be reached. Mr. McKenna also couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
