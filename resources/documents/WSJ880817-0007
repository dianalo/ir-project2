Is Set </HL><AUTHOR> William Power (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX </IN><TEXT>      Institutional buyers dipped their toes back in the struggling over-the-counter market yesterday, as the Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 1.59 to 375.66   But while portfolio managers, banks and mutual funds returned to buy such Nasdaq issues as MCI Communications, Intel, Tele-Communications and Apple Computer, all of which rose in price, individual investors remained largely absent from the market. Nasdaq, which relies on individuals for 58% of its volume compared with the New York Stock Exchange's 49% reliance, has been particularly hurt by the lack of retail interest in stocks lately.    Meanwhile, that continuing volume scarcity has led to the planned takeover of Brokers Securities Inc., a well-known discount brokerage firm specializing in OTC stocks.    Under an agreement in principle announced yesterday, big, expansion-minded Norstar Brokerage Corp., a unit of Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, will acquire Brokers Securities for about $1 million, and the accord probably won't be the last in the discount-brokerage industry. &quot;We're interested in acquiring other discount brokers -- it's a good way to increase our volume,&quot; said Edward McLeod, president and chief executive officer of Norstar Brokerage.    Brokers Securities, based in Norfolk, Va., used heavy advertising, including numerous commercials on cable television's Financial News Network, to expand its customer base to some 15,000 accounts in 40 states. But the lack of OTC volume, said President Roger &quot;Buddy&quot; West, made Brokers Securities &quot;more than happy&quot; to sell out when Norstar came along. &quot;They knocked on my door and I was more than happy to accommodate them,&quot; Mr. West said. He said his firm's revenue is about 32% off last year's pace of $2 million.    With the Norstar pact, Brokers Securities becomes a public shell sitting on cash; Mr. West said he's looking to merge the shell with a small private brokerage firm wanting to go public.    In Nasdaq trading yesterday, Brokers Securities stock was quoted at 1 7/8 bid, unchanged.    Among active Nasdaq stocks, American Carriers fell 1 7/8 to 1 5/8, following its 1 3/4-point drop on Monday. Yesterday's bad news: The Overland Park, Kan., trucker announced that two units, American Freight System Inc. and USA Western Inc., are ceasing operations and filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection. The 964,800 American Carriers shares traded was eighth-highest on the most-active list.    Air Wis Services jumped 2 1/2 to 15 5/8. The airline said it received a letter from Cove Capital Associates, representing a shareholder group including Transmark USA Inc., that wants to discuss a possible acquisition of the company. Air Wis said its directors haven't yet met to consider a response.    Peter J. DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., New York, said the OTC market, like the Big Board, was &quot;oversold&quot; yesterday and due for a technical rebound.    &quot;On the OTC market there has been a lot of cash raised by people selling,&quot; and institutional buyers had to return to the market to replenish their holdings, Mr. DaPuzzo said. He added: &quot;I think the retail public is still on vacation. We didn't see much interest from them, unfortunately.&quot;    Yesterday's Nasdaq volume was 128.9 million shares, continuing a sluggish volume that's about 15% below last year's pace at this time.    How much did Nasdaq's big stocks dominate yesterday? Even though there were 1,059 declining issues and only 1,001 advancing ones, the big stocks that advanced on typically high volume enabled advancing shares to far outnumber decliners, by 53.5 million shares to 28.7 million. </TEXT></DOC>
