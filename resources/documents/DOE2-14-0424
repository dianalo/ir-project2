The authors now present an additionalcharacteristic not previously described: oval lesions whose long axesare perpendicular to the anteroposterior axis of the head. This findingwas identified in 11 of 12 clinically confirmed cases of MS evaluatedwith intracerebral MR imaging. Therefore, its presence is a helpful confirmatoryfinding in the diagnosis of MS, given the proper clinical setting.</TEXT></DOC>
