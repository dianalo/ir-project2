Gold Charter is the closely held parent of Golding Industries Inc., a Marion, S.C., textile designer and producer. Publicker provides carbon dioxide to the beverage industry.    Publicker will use proceeds from last December's $30 million offering of subordinated notes for the purchase. The transaction is expected to close next month.    In 1986, Golding had sales of $62 million. Publicker's sales were $13.4 million. Publicker said that at June 30, it had net operating-loss carry-forwards of about $67 million to shelter future taxable income.    Publicker's president, David Herman, said the company decided to buy Gold Charter because &quot;it's a well-run company with good prospects for the future.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Publicker closed at $3.50 a share, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
