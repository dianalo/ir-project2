B-38 EXP micro-computers tosupport the new National Pollution Funds Center.andP;  The B-38s, along with 12existing ATandamp;T Co. 6325 micros and six Apple Computer Inc.andP;  Macintoshes, willbe linked on a local network.andM;&quot;This is a big for the Coast Guard,&quot; said Cmdr.andP;  Michael G. Fay, director ofthe Coast Guard's Systems Management Division.andP;  &quot;It is progressive, in thesense that we are used to less.&quot;andM;The Coast Guard, a Transportation Department agency, bought the ATandamp;T andApple micros through DOT's Office Automation Technology and Servicescontract.andP;  For the B38s, the agency is turning to a 3-year-old supportcontract with Unysis Corp., Convergent's parent company.andM;The National Pollution Funds Center, created by the Oil Pollution Act, willhandle claims from anycity, state or nation seeking funds to clean up oilspills.andP;  The center will manage a $1 billion trust fund established byCongress, said Cmdr.andP;  Theron A. Patrick, chief of the center's CaseManagement Division.andP;  The money comes from a new tax on oiland from fundscollected from polluters.andM;Officials expect the center to begin processing claims in april or May.andP;  Thecomputer systems will support claims processing as well as financialmanagement and administration of the center, which will be housed in officesin the Washington, D.C., area.andP;  Although the office location was notestablished at press time, thecenter set up a small network at Coast Guardheadquarters to begin testing.andM;'Tunnel Vision'andM;The centerhs network manager, Chris Baker, a marine science technician secondclass, said the network eventually will support 88 users.andM;&quot;The system was designed to be very open and will support multiple protocolsso that we can communicate with any kind of machine.andP;  If they get a Prime orSun mini-computer, they can just hook it in and it will work,&quot; Baker said.andM;The network also will support the Government Open Systems InterconnectionProfile and Posix, &quot;so that when those standards are defined and we have tomigrate that way, we do not have to change thecommunications platform.andP;  It'salready there,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;The equipment I've got is top of the line.andP;  It's good stuff, very wellsupported,&quot; Baker said.andM;&quot;I've been in the Coast Guard about eight years and I learned a long time agoworking with other systems that you need to plan forwhat's going to happen.andO;Officials only plan for what's in front of them.andP;  They get tunnel vision,&quot; hesaid.andM;The Convergen B-38s run the Burroughs Technial Operating Systems, which isnot compatible with the MS-DOS applications running on the Coast Guard'sother micros.andP;  Baker said by using an emulation package from Unysis, theB-38s can run nearly any MS-DOS application and access programs such asWordPerfect Corp.'s WordPerfect and Microsoft Corp.'s Windows.andM;&quot;It does have a few limitations.andP;  It's only about 90 percent IBM-compatible,&quot; Baker said.andP;  &quot;If you get a program that makes a device-levelcall -- that is, it bypasses the operating system and talks directly to thehardware -- it will not work.&quot;andM;Baker said the B-38s are clustered, with oneworkstation acting as a master.andO;The cluster is connected by twisted-pair cabling.andP;  &quot;It's kind of a proprietynetwork operating system.andP;  The master is similar to an IBMfile server,&quot; hesaid.andM;&quot;We're going to have five of those masters.andP;  The file server masters will behooked together using Ethernet,&quot; Baker said.andM;&quot;The software that they're using for the Ethernet is a Unysis proprietypackage [BNet II], but it supports the Open Systems Interconnection stack andalso jointly will support the TCP/IP stack.andP;  So it's a multiple-protocolsystem.&quot;andM;With the IBM-compatible ATandamp;T 6325s, Baker said he will use Microsoft LANManager running under OS/2.andM;Macintosh StrengthsandM;&quot;One of the strengths of LAN Manager is that it has a very strong Macintoshsupport.andP;  What it allows you to do is put an AppleTalk card in the fileserver, then hook theMacintoshes together using their native AppleTalk,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;When they log into thefile server, they log in just like IBM wouldinto a file server.&quot;andM;The LAN Manager LAN will be linked to theB-38s at the center via repeatersfrom Cabletron Systems Inc. of Rochester, N.H.andP;  The repeaters support a largeand diverse LANby retiming file signals.andP;  If a signal comes in from any onecomputer, a repeater transmits it to all ports on the network.andM;&quot;Regardless of what particular wire or backbone cable the message comes inon,&quot; Baker explained, &quot;it gets repeated across all theother backbone cables.&quot;andM;The repeaters will feed into a router from Cisco Systems Inc. of Menlo Park,Calif.andP;  Baker said the router he is using was designed primarily as a TCP/IPunit, but it cansupport multiple protocols.andM;&quot;It is an intelligent switch.andP;  When one node workstation wants to sendsomething to another node that's not on its cable, it transmits a packet,&quot;Baker said.andP;  &quot;It has a &quot;To' address and a 'From' address.andP;  It looks at whereyou want to go, looks up on its tables where that person is and then sends itout to that system.andP;  So it's an intelligent switch that helps controltraffic.&quot;andM;The router at the pollution funds center will be tied to a router at CoastGuard headquarters by two high-speed data lines.andP;  With redundant lines, thecenter will have back-up data transmission protection.andM;&quot;We will be able to share information with Coast Guard headquarters and usesome of the computers in HQ,&quot; Baker said.andP;  &quot;Also through HQ, we can getthrough to theoutside world if we need to talk with state, local or federalagencies or a university or just about anybody.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
