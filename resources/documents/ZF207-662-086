(grades 7 to 12)andM;The year is 1848, and Jerrod Wilson, a mild-mannered newspaper reporter inBrooklyn, is ready for adventure.andP;  When he gets a letter from his long-lostbrother jake in Sutter's Fort, California, Jerrod realizes it's time to headwest.andP;  Your job is to guide an animated Jerrod through detailed scenes ofBrooklyn, the journey west, and frontier California, helping him collectsupplies and brave the dangers of the trip until he finds gold and hisbrother.andM;Jerrod can travel overland by wagon train, take a ship around Cape Horn, orsail to Panama and then trek across the isthmus to catch another boat toCalifornia.andP;  In each adventure, Jerrod must cope with unique perils.andP;  Sailingaround Cape Horn, for example, he will die of scurvy unless you pack somelemons for the trip.andP;  Crossing Panama, he is attacked by Indians.andP;  And thewagon train will plunge into a river if you don't unhitch the oxen beforesending them down to get a drink.andM;Gold Rush! contains many classic adventure game themes-treasures to unearth,secret notes to decipher, bad guys to outwit-but the historical detail isabundant and accurate, too.andP;  The game comes with an entertaining 88-pagemini-history of the Gold Rush, which doubles as a form of copy protection;each time the game begins, you must answer a trivia question taken from thebooklet.andM;The Oregon Trail (grades 3 to 6) Pack up the Conestoga, hitch up the oxen,and head west with Oregon Trail, another historical simulation game thatgives a different glimpse of life on the frontier.andM;Each player has a choice of personae: a Boston banker, an Ohio carpenter, oran Illinois farmer.andP;  The banker has the most money; because the carpenter andfarmer are at a disadvantage, they can rack up more points for theiraccomplishments.andM;Before setting out from Independence, Missouri, you must buy provisions anddecide when to embark on the journey.andP;  If you leave too early, the riverswill be hard to ford and forage will be sparse; leave too late and snows inthe Rockies may hamper progress.andM;Along the way, the travelers run into natural perils, disease, and accidents,as well as the consequences of their own decisions.andP;  While on the trail, youcan swap supplies with other pioneers, vary the rate of travel and amount ofrations consumed, and just chat with other travelers.andP;  You can also hunt forfood in a simple arcade-style game.andP;  The hunting works fine on a standard PC,but a 286 machine speeds up the action so much that only the most adeptsharpshooters will be able to bag a meal.andM;Audubon Wildlife Adventures: Grizzly Bears (grades 3 to 6)andM;The first in a series of Wildlife Adventures developed by the NationalAudubon Society, Grizzly Bears lets you participate in four differentanimated stories about life in the wilderness.andP;  In &quot;Grizzly Bear Mystery,&quot;for example, you are a research biologist who must examine evidence andinterview suspects in the case of a murdered bear.andP;  The four differentversions each have different clues and a different culprit.andM;In &quot;Bear Encounters,&quot; players investigate reports of human run-ins withgrizzlies, Which bear broke into the condo or ate garbage from the dumpster?andO;Should the bear be relocated or destroyed? In each of eight variations, youmake the recommendation and see the results.andP;  In other scenarios, you try tosave the grizzly habitat from damage caused by oil drilling.andM;Grizzly Bears is more didactic than most role-playing adventures.andP;  The CGAgraphics are dull, and sometimes the educational content slows down theaction.andP;  The game is basically an onscreen ecology lesson.andP;  The supplementalGrizzly Guidebook includes noncomputer games and activities for learning moreabout grizzly bears.andP;  Balance of Power: The 1990 Edition (grades 9 to 12)andM;In this game of global intrigue and power politics, Balance of Power: The1990 Edition, you step into the shoes of George Bush or Mikhail Gorbachev.andO;Gazing at a map of the world, you use pull-down menus to allocate economicand military aid, make treaties, applydiplomatic pressure, and send troops tobolster allies and destabilize unfriendly regimes.andP;  The goal is to amass&quot;prestige points&quot; and stymie your opponent's expansion.andM;Balance of Power is more complex than it first seems.andP;  Trying to bully andbluster, to stare down the president or the general secretary, will quicklytrigger a nuclear holocaust.andP;  The game rewards a gender geopoliticaldemeanor; success comes to those who use aid and treaties to strengthenallies and who subtly destabilize their opponents by funding the oppositionand engaging in diplomatic offensives.andM;Unfortunately, because the game mixes factual current situations withhypothetical revolutions, civil wars, and coups, it risks confusing tile highschool kids it's designed for.andP;  Nicaragua, for example, is depicted as aleftist state threatened by U.S.-funded insurgents, which reflects today'sreality.andP;  But the game also treats Lebanon as a Soviet ally-anoversimplification at best.andM;Still, Balance of Power's model of international relations is unquestionablyeducational-illustrating, for example, how the state of a country's economyinfluences the likelihood of a coup d'etat.andP;  And no one who plays this gamewill be able to ignore the issue of nuclear disarmament.andP;  Wl Gold Rush!andO;Grades 7 to 12 List Price: $39.95andM;Requires: 256K RAM; CGA,andM;EGA, MCGA, VGA, or Hercules graphics.andP;  Also available for Apple IIGS,Commodore Amiga, and Atari ST.andM;Sierra On-Line P.O.andP;  Box 485 Coarsegold, Calif.andP;  93614 800-344-7448 (ordersonly) 209-683-4468andM;The Oregon Trail Grades 3 to 6 List Price: $39.95 Requires: 256K RAM, CGAandM;graphics.andP;  Also available for Apple II.andM;MECC 3490 Lexington Ave.andP;  N.andP;  St.andP;  Paul, Minn.andP;  55126 .andP;  800-228-3504andM;612-481-3500andM;Audubon Wildlife Adventures: Grizzly Bears Grades 3 to 6 List Price: $49.95Requires: 256K RAM, CGAandM;graphics.andP;  Also availableandM;for Apple II.andM;Advanced Ideas, Inc.andM;2902 San Pablo Ave.andP;  Berkeley, Calif.andP;  94702 415-526-9100andM;Balance of Power: The 1990 Edition Grades 9 to 12 List Price: $49.95andM;Requires: 640K RAM, hard disk,andM;Microsoft Windows 2.0 (run-time version available for $15), graphics card.andO;286 or 386 computer recommended.andP;  Also available for Apple IIGS, Macintosh,Atari ST, and Commodore AmigaandM;Mindscape, Inc.andP;  3444 Dundee Rd.andP;  Northbrook, Ill.andP;  60062 800-221-9884312-480-1948</TEXT></DOC>
