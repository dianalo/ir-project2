Bond prices rose modestly and the dollar posted solidgains against the mark and yen.</LP><TEXT>   The stock market closed before Baghdad Radio announcedlate yesterday that Saddam Hussein had ordered Iraqi forcesto withdraw from Kuwait.   Before that news, the U.S. stock market followed the leadof Japanese and European markets and rallied sharply at theopening, fueled by the rapid advance of allied forces and thesurprisingly light casualties they sustained. At its peak,the Dow industrials were up more than 37 points.   But profit-taking by wary investors quickly erased thesegains. Traders said many money managers are worried that thegood news from the battlefront can't continue unabated. Andthey argue that the stock market is especially vulnerable todisappointments given the substantial gains of the pastmonth.   Yet what little bad news there was didn't hurt prices.News at midafternoon that an Iraqi Scud missile had destroyeda building housing U.S. troops left prices virtuallyunchanged.   Even if the allies achieve victory soon, some analystswarned, the stock rally could succumb to economic problems onthe home front. Gary Shilling, an economist and moneymanager, said the 400-point advance since mid-January, basedon widespread assumptions that the economy will soon perk up,may collapse if the recession is as serious and long-lastingas he believes it will be.   Mr. Shilling, a longtime pessimist, suggests that thecurrent situation may come to resemble the &quot;little bullmarket&quot; that occurred in 1930 as stocks recovered from BlackMonday. Both the economy and the stock market soon plungedinto the Great Depression. While he doesn't expect adepression, Mr. Shilling said the economy may still need toshake out the excesses of the 1980s much as the GreatDepression wrung out the excesses of the 1920s.   &quot;We've had all the greed and glitz and now we may wind upwith the grief,&quot; he said.   In major market action:                                                                                                          Stock prices were mixed. Volume on the New York StockExchange totaled 193.8 million shares. Advancing issues onthe Big Board were ahead of decliners 939 to 649.                                                                                                          Bond prices rose. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bondsgained about an eighth of a point, or about $1.25 for each$1,000 of face amount. The yield on the issue fell to 8.04%.                                                                                                          The dollar strengthened.
