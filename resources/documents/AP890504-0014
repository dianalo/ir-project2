Policemen who had ringed the vast expanse were unable to holdback the several thousand students from at least eight universitiesin the city's northeast who surged into the square, the symboliccenter of power in China.   A crowd of about 1,000 onlookers also ran into the square,climbing on the monument to revolutionary heroes that has been afocal point of pro-democracy protests launched by students morethan two weeks ago.   Another 4,000 students from 10 Beijing universities and fivegroups from out-of-town schools were heading to the square from thewest. They had left campuses at 8:30 a.m. with a burst offirecrackers and the bang of a gong.   The students had said Tuesday they would march unless thecountry's Communist leaders recognized their independent studentorganization. On Wednesday, the government refused and said thesquare would be closed Thursday.   A group of 300 journalists meanwhile held a protest at theofficial Xinhua News Agency, calling for a free press, and some ofthem broke away to join the student march, carrying banners callingfor press freedoms.   ``A closed press does not contribute to stability,'' said onebanner.   As they marched through streets lined by thousands of cheeringworkers, the students met less police resistance than in previousmarches.   The students carried dozens of red and white banners calling fora free press and democratic reforms. Some wore headbands saying,``Mom, I'm not wrong.''   Most students met little police resistance when, at about 9:30a.m., they broke through the first line of several hundred policeblocking the street.   But several thousand students from Beijing Normal Collegeovercame strong resistance from several hundred police by shovingtheir way through, as surrounding crowds yelled ``Let themthrough!'' and ``Hurry up!''   Students from the People's University pushed a three-wheeledcart holding a loudspeaker that blared slogans. They also carried alarge red banner painted with a bright green dragon and the words``science, democracy, freedom and human rights'' in each corner.   In contrast to last week's march on Tiananmen Square, whenstudents were angered by the government's opposition to theirdemands for democracy and freedom, Thursday's march commemoratingthe anniversary of the 1919 May Fourth student movement had an airof defiant celebration.   Last Thursday, about 150,000 students and supporters had stageda 20-mile march through the square and the capital's streets.   ``Today is a holiday, and we are here to remember May Fourth,''said one student.   Thousands of workers had defied government warnings that theywould be fired if they attended the march, said one governmentemployee.   ``But this is the first time in 40 years such a big movement fordemocracy has occurred. I'll just show up at work tomorrow and seewhat happens,'' he said on condition of anonymity.   People leaned out of bus windows and pushed into the crowds tosnatch leaflets handed out by the students. The leaflets explainedthe students' goals and called on all sections of society to arise.   ``If this develops, I think China has hope,'' said one bystander.   At one corner, crowds jeered as a police loudspeaker saidrepeatedly: ``Please, everybody, obey the people's police. Upholdtraffic order. Students who uphold the party and socialism pleasereturn to school.''   Student leaders said they expected more than 40 universitiesaround Beijing to join in the march.   Since April 15, when the current demonstrations began, studentshave successfully marched to the square on five different occasions.   Students also have boycotted classes the past two weeks in thelargest protest the Chinese Communist authorities have faced intheir 40 years of rule.   Student leaders participating in Thursday's march said they wereconsidering returning to class on May 8.   Police had closed off the central square early Thursday,clearing all pedestrians off the vast 100-acre plaza.   About 2,000 international finance officials and bankers gatheredat the Great Hall of the People, on the western side of the square,Thursday morning for the opening of the annual meeting of AsianDevelopment Bank.   ``They tried to close it (the square) on April 22, and look whathappened then,'' Beijing Normal University student leader Wu'erKaixi said Wednesday.   Police presence has been heavy at previous demonstrations, butpolice are unarmed and have made only minimal efforts to stop themarchers.   Marches were reportedly planned in Shanghai, Tianjin and othercities. About 60 journalists from state-run newspapers also saidthey planned a rally outside the gates of the official Xinhua NewsAgency.   The tightly controlled press has barely covered thedemonstrations and has expressed the government line that theindependent student unions formed by the activists are illegal.   On Wednesday, Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang, in a majorspeech to mark the May Fourth Movement, called for stability.   ``Haven't we had enough social turmoil? Since 1849, China hashad only about 20 years of stability,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
