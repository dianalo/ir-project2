But the American John Beynon wins praise in Asia for designingschools that can stand up to cyclones, floods and earthquakes.   ``No regrets,'' said the 53-year-old ``disaster architect'' whenasked if he ever thinks about skyscrapers and glamorous homes hemight have created.   ``Here, we're dealing with very real, urgent problems and theseyou find in the poorest and remotest areas. There's more work thanone can handle in a lifetime.''   Over the last few years a greater and more organized effort hasbeen made in Asia on minimizing the blows of natural forces. Partof the impetus has come from massive disasters as the 1985 cyclonethat killed 10,000 people in Bangladesh and last year's earthquakein Armenia, where 25,000 people died.   ``As someone pointed out after the Armenian earthquake,`Earthquakes don't kill people, buildings do,''' Beynon said.``There are very few natural disasters which should inevitablydestroy a building.''   The U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO), where Beynon serves as principal architect, is focusingon disaster-proofing school buildings in nearly 20 Asian nationsincluding Bangladesh, India, the Philippines and Vietnam.   ``When there is a cyclone, go to the school,'' UNESCO advisesAsians in villages where the school building is a safe structureand homes tend to be flimsy. If it survives a natural disaster, theschool _ often the largest building of the community _ serves asthe obvious center for shelter and relief.   Conversely, rural children may suffer disproportionately highcasualties in classrooms when natural disasters strike because themost densely populated area in an Asian village is likely to be theschool, and it's often not safe enough.   ``We don't like to talk to officials in the capitals,'' Beynonsaid. ``We go to the end of the line.''   In Nepal this meant trekking for days to remote Himalayanhamlets where he learned that while iron and concrete may make forthe best earthquake-proofing these are hardly the materials to becarried in on the backs of porters. Material available in the areahas to be used.   ``My first approach is to listen and learn from the people,''Beynon said. ``During the first week you forget everything you knowand look at the problem through their eyes and skills and then youtry to improve on this. The greatest disaster is the instantexpert.''   Beynon tries to persuade planners that for only a little addedto a school's total cost _ 3 percent to 15 percent in the case ofcyclone protection _ they can save lives as well as money in thelong term.   He tries to get local ``barefoot architects'' to provide ideasand skills. UNESCO gives assistance and training in the concepts ofdisaster architecture.   To resist cyclones, a general term for typhoons, hurricanes andtropical storms, structures must be designed from the top down. Thegreat wind force of a cyclone tends to lift buildings upwards so asystem of special attachments running from roof to foundation mustbe incorporated to figuratively chain them down.   To minimize earthquake damage, schools are designed to movewith, rather than against, the various motions unleashed by seismicdisturbances. Structures must be flexible yet also held together byencompassing ``bands'' of iron, wood or other materials.   Schools in flood-prone regions are best set above the ground.They should include a waterproof room where equipment can quicklybe secured as well as cooking and toilet facilities for those whotake shelter. Since the school could serve as a final refuge and aplatform for relief supplies from the sky, the roof must be builtflat and strong.   Beynon accumulated his skills at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology, where he studied architecture, and while working for anAmerican foundation sponsoring innovative work in educationaldesign.   He joined UNESCO in 1964 in Paris, moving in 1980 to its Asianheadquarters in Bangkok where his team includes another architect,a civil engineer and a furniture designer.   Beynon was called to the island of Tonga in the Pacific in 1982after more than 10 percent of its schools were razed by TropicalCyclone Isaac. Since cyclones strike Tonga in 20-year cycles, therehad been little sense of urgency.   With Beynon's help cyclone-proof schools were designed and putup. Prefabricated construction was used for schools on outerislands that lacked skilled craftsmen.   ``We'll have to wait another 15 years to see how good our workwas,'' he said, referring to the 20-year cycles.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wed PMs Oct. 11</NOTE></DOC>
