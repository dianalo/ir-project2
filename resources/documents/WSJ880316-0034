Five new board members were also elected.    Mr. Guttman, 38 years old, defeated former board member John Tafaro, 42, for the vice chairman post. The election was closely watched because Mr. Tafaro's last-minute candidacy was supported by William M. Bradt, the exchange chairman; as previously reported, Mr. Guttman last week had openly criticized both men, implying they were trying to get rid of him for his role in pursuing an internal inquiry about Mr. Bradt three months ago.    The five new board members elected were Gary Lapayover, Charles Edelstein, Gregory Boyd, Richard Ruzika and Stanley Meierfeld, a former vice chairman.    The election comes at a time when the exchange is dealing with several big issues, including a proposed merger with New York's Commodity Exchange and possibly all of the city's futures exchanges; a proposed new trading facility; new contracts, and international expansion through computer-screen trading or links with overseas exchanges.    The six seats that were up for grabs were a record number in the 116-year history of the exchange. </TEXT></DOC>
