Cordell National, which had assets of $77 million, was closed Friday by Robert Hermann, senior deputy comptroller of the currency, and the FDIC was named receiver. The FDIC's board arranged a transfer of the insured deposits to City National because no acceptable bids were received for a merger of the failed bank.    When it closed, Cordell National had deposits of about $71.3 million in 5,800 accounts, including $146,000 in 82 accounts that exceeded the federal insurance limit of $100,000. The bank's creditors and its uninsured depositors will share with the FDIC in funds realized from liquidation of the bank's assets.    All insured deposits will be available to the owners immediately. City National is paying the FDIC a $25,000 premium for the right to receive the transferred deposits and will purchase some of Cordell's assets for $39 million.    Cordell National is the 132nd bank in the U.S. to fail this year and the 16th in Oklahoma, the FDIC said. </TEXT></DOC>
