The alternative cost ofenergy that a cogenerator would incur, including the cost of both thecogeneration system and of any supplemental conventional utility purchases,are then computed. The difference between these costs, or the operatingcost reduction, is the project revenue. The capital costs of the cogenerationsystem are estimated to determine the required incremental investmentand the economic merit of the project. Two areas must be addressed inthe preparation of any feasibility analysis. First is the identificationof all cost components, and second is the development of actual costestimates. In this chapter, the individual cost components are identifiedand reviewed. Each of them should be considered in the conduct of anyfeasibility study, for it is the depth to which they are analyzed thatis the most significant contributor to the cost of the analysis. Thispaper reviews both the operating and the capital cost considerationsof cogeneration economics.</TEXT></DOC>
