The country's largest opposition party, victorious in Sunday'sby-election, demanded today that Prime Minister Noboru Takeshitaresign or dissolve parliament ``so the people can express theirwill'' about the Recruit scandal.   Takako Doi, head of the Japan Socialist Party, told parliamenther party's victory in the election in Fukuoka in southern Japanshowed that public has lost faith in the corruption-taintedTakeshita adminstration.   The balloting was widely seen as a test of the damage done by thescandal.   Takeshita refused to dissolve the legislature, which would meancalling new elections for its lower house.   Recruit reportedly sold tens of thousands of unlisted shares ofstock at bargain prices to politicians, their aides and otherprominent people. The purchasers then profited when the stocks werepublicly traded and skyrocketed in value. The scandal has alsoinvolved direct political donations by Recruit.   Prosecutors said they today arrested Hiromasa Ezoe, founder andformer chairman of the information services conglomerate. Alsoarrested were a vice president of a Recruit subsidiary and to formerofficials of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's largest company.   The Recruit officials were arrested on suspicion of givingbribes, the two Nippon officials in connection with receivingbribes, news reports said.   Prosecutors said Ezoe was taken from a hospital where he had beenunder treatment for exhaustion since the scandal was uncovered lastsummer.   Three Cabinet ministers and more than a dozen other prominentpoliticians and businessmen have since resigned in the scandal,which has led to broader questions about political fund-raising andlinks between business and politics.   ``The election (Sunday) showed that people in Fukuoka won't putup with any more (of Takeshita's policies),'' Ms. Doi told cheeringopposition lawmakers today. ``Either the entire Cabinet must resign,or the prime minister must dissolve parliament so the people canexpress their will.''   A dissolution of Japan's parliament, the Diet, would force anelection for the lower house, where Takeshita's governing LiberalDemocratic Party has more than 300 of the 512 seats. An election isscheduled in July for half of the seats in the upper house, whichcannot be dissolved.   In Sunday's race, Socialist Sadao Fuchigami defeated LiberalDemocrat Kei Oma by 751,036 to 564,301 votes. The special electionwas called after the incumbent Liberal Democratic lawmaker died inDecember.   The election was the first for a national office since theRecruit scandal came to light last summer and the Liberal Democratspushed a controversial 3 percent sales tax through parliament inDecember.   The unpopular tax, which takes effect in April, reduces Japan'sheavy reliance on direct taxes by cutting corporate and upper-levelincome taxes.   The voting was seen as an indicator of what might happen in theJuly upper house elections. Severe setbacks in the July electionscould endanger Takeshita's chances next October to win anothertwo-year term as party president and prime minister.   Takeshita said he would undertake political reform to restore thepeople's trust in politics.   ``I will stake everything on political reform. I will carry itout tenaciously and patiently without considering a dissolution (ofparliament) or a resignation of the Cabinet,'' he told parliament.   Ms. Doi called for a ban on corporate political contributions andadded: ``Instead of political reform, let's have political ethics.''   The Recruit scandal erupted when it was disclosed that Ezoe soldunlisted shares in a real estate subsidiary more than 150influential politicians, bureacrats and journalists before publictrading in the shares began.   The share prices then rose sharply in value and some of thepurchasers made more than $80,000 in tax-free profits. Although thesales were not illegal in themselves, they raised questions ofpossible bribery and influence-peddling.</TEXT></DOC>
