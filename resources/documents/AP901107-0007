With 76 percent of precincts reporting in the 6th CongressionalDistrict, Gingrich had 53,147 votes, or 50 percent, to 54,034votes, or 50 percent, for Democrat David Worley, a Jonesborolawyer.   Gingrich, a diehard tax cutter, led the pack of conservativeswho bucked President Bush's original deficit-reduction compromisewith the Democratic leadership in Congress.   Miller, the lieutenant governor for 16 years, rode voterenthusiasm over a state lottery to victory in the governor's race.   With 88 percent of precincts reporting, Miller had 633,710votes, or 54 percent, to 503,115 votes, or 43 percent, forRepublican Johnny Isakson, a prosperous Atlanta real estate companyexecutive and state legislator for 14 years.   Miller had been a heavy favorite to keep the governor's officein Democratic hands. The incumbent, Joe Frank Harris, leaves officein January after the state limit of two consecutive terms.   The state's 10 members of the U.S. House, nine Democrats and aRepublican, all faced opposition Tuesday. Sen. Sam Nunn, aDemocrat, had no opposition.   Miller, 58, defeated four opponents, including former MayorAndrew Young in an Aug. 7 runoff, to win the Democratic nominationfor governor.   Young since has campaigned for Miller but has said he may tryagain in four years to become the state's first black governor.Miller has said he will retire after serving a single four-yearterm.   Isakson, 45, sought to neutralize the lottery as an issue byendorsing the proposal, himself, while differing with Miller on howthe revenue should be used to enhance education.</TEXT></DOC>
