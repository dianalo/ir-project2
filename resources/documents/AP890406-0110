The group, called the Joint Associations Working Group, said itwas essential to import contract laborers to avoid inflation andfalling economic competitiveness.   Hong Kong needs about 50,000 imported workers, most of themunskilled, to help fill an estimated 200,000 job vacancies, it said.   The group's chairman, Martin Barrow, an executive at JardineMatheson Holdings Ltd., said there was danger Hong Kong could loseit ``competitiveness in the manufacturing sector, the hotelindustry and elsewhere'' because of the shortage of workers.   The government said Tuesday it is considering easingrestrictions on employment of foreign laborers. Under currentpolicy, only foreign workers with skills not available locally areallowed to work in the colony.   Hong Kong's low unemployment rate, currently 1.3 percent, isconsidered a key factor behind the economy's growth slowing to anexpected 6 percent this year, less than half the 1987 rate.   The labor shortage is due to tight immigration laws and a steadydrain of talent as the colony approaches its return to Chinesesovereignty in 1997.   The report said the government should encourage automation andproductivity through tax breaks and reducing red tape. It saidbringing in workers on six-month to two-year contracts, similar topractices in Singapore, would provide relief.   The group also suggested the possibility of Hong Kong usingworkers who would commute daily from China.</TEXT></DOC>
