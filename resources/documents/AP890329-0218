DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal appeals court reserved ruling on arequest by unionized workers at four metropolitan area commuterrailroads to overturn a ban against their striking in sympathy withEastern Airlines employees.   Lawyers for the railroads argued Tuesday before the three-memberpanel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the RailwayLabor Act requires the railroad employees to stay on the job untilthey go through a series of mediation steps.   Until the 2nd Circuit decides otherwise, U.S. District JudgeRobert Patterson Jr.'s injunctions against sympathy strikes remainin force.   At issue is whether unionized workers at the Long Island RailRoad, NJ Transit, Metro-North Commuter Railroad and Amtrak mayhonor picket lines set up by machinists who struck Eastern on March4.   Both the unions and the railroads agree that if all or mostunion workers honored the machinists' picket lines, the fourrailroads would have to shut down, throwing transportationfacilities into chaos for more than 400,000 daily commuters in theNew York metropolitan area.   On March 20, Patterson barred the railroad unions from honoringthe picket lines and ordered union officials to tell their membersto go to work if any picket lines went up at railroad facilities.   ``We have been stripped of the most fundamental right that laborhas: to withdraw its services and to call upon other workers towithdraw their services,'' Joseph Guerrieri Jr., lawyer for theunions, told the appeals panel.   He claimed that because the railroad workers have no disputewith their own employers they would not have to go through thenumerous steps required by the Railway Labor Act before walking offthe job in a sympathy strike.   But Bernard Plum, lawyer for the LIRR and Metro-North, said theRailway Labor Act encompassed all disputes and to claim workerscould strike if they said there was no dispute ``defies logic.''</TEXT></DOC>
