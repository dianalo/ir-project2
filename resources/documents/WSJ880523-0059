The Treasury said that while the April budget showed a surplus, it narrowed to $13.89 billion from $38.91 billion a year earlier. The surplus, which reflects April's heavy tax payments, pushed the deficit for the first seven months of fiscal 1988, which ends Sept. 30, to $105.03 billion, compared with $84.31 billion a year before.    In last December's budget-cutting accord, the administration and Congress agreed to measures that are designed to bring the fiscal 1988 deficit to $146.7 billion, down from $148.92 billion in fiscal 1987. Most private forecasters think that's unlikely, and the Congressional Budget Office projects a gap of $161 billion, largely because it expects interest rates to be higher than administration projections.    &quot;Barring any miracles, we're not going to be able to make it to $146.7 billion for the year,&quot; said Peter Davis, a budget analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., who projects a gap as wide as $165 billion.    Under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-cutting law, the 1988 deficit is supposed to be narrower than $144 billion, although there isn't a penalty for failing to hit the target this year.    The latest surplus was widely expected to be below last year's figure, which benefited from heavy capital gains tax payments by investors who had sold assets at the end of 1986 before higher tax rates on those gains took effect. The $13.89 billion figure was several billion dollars below most estimates, however.    Susan Hering, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York, said she now expects the 1988 deficit to be at the upper end of her $150 billion to $155 billion range.    Both she and Mr. Davis, however, noted that some special factors that lowered the surplus for April may benefit May's projected deficit. Because May 1 fell on a Friday, for example, a military pay increase and some federal benefit payments that normally would have been made in May occurred this year in April.    Over the longer term, however, the deficit may be widened substantially by the large amount of government spending expected to be necessary to bail out troubled banks.    Last month, receipts totaled $109.32 billion, down from $122.9 billion in April 1987. Outlays rose to $95.43 billion from $83.99 billion.    In March, receipts totaled $65.73 billion, outlays were $94.88 billion, and the deficit was $29.15 billion.    For the first seven months of fiscal 1988, receipts rose to $522.07 billion from $506.66 billion, while outlays increased to $627.09 billion from $590.97 billion.    The government paid $14.86 billion in interest on the public debt last month, up from $14.44 billion in March. </TEXT></DOC>
