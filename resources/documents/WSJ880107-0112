Judge Kennedy was quite careful in expressing his views about the Ninth Amendment. One view was that the amendment was designed to protect the ability of the states to confer rights beyond those in the Bill of Rights. A second view -- which your editorial ignores completely -- is that the amendment shows a belief by the Framers that fundamental rights exist that are not expressly enumerated in the first eight amendments. Judge Kennedy testified, for example, that the Ninth Amendment is a &quot;reserve clause, to be held in the event that the phrase 'liberty' and the other spacious phrases in the Constitution appear to be inadequate for the court's decision.&quot; This statement, curiously absent from your editorial, appears immediately after the passage upon which the editorial relies.    Furthermore, the following day, Judge Kennedy reiterated this view even more clearly, testifying in response to Sen. Humphrey that &quot;Madison wrote (the Ninth Amendment) for two reasons. . . . (F)irst of all (he) wanted to make it clear that the first eight amendments were not an exhaustive catalog of all human rights.&quot; While Judge Kennedy also repeated his testimony about state-conferred rights, this articulation of the Ninth Amendment's intent stands in stark contrast to Judge Bork's views of the amendment.    This contrast between Judge Kennedy and Judge Bork also became clear when I questioned Judge Kennedy about Chief Justice Burger's majority opinion in the Richmond Newspapers Inc. v. Virginia (1980) case. The chief justice's opinion sounds a theme that I have emphasized throughout the past several months: That &quot;the concerns expressed by Madison and others have . . . been resolved; fundamental rights, even though not expressly guaranteed, have been recognized by the court as indispensable to the enjoyment of rights explicitly defined.&quot; To support this point -- a point Judge Bork rejected -- Chief Justice Burger cited the Ninth Amendment. And he described it as a &quot;constitutional 'savings clause,' &quot;a term quite similar to the &quot;reserve clause&quot; idea invoked by Judge Kennedy. Judge Bork's testimony on the Ninth Amendment, as well as his statements before his hearings, makes clear that he did not embrace any such notion.    Moreover, Judge Kennedy responded to my questioning on the Richmond Newspapers case by reaffirming the &quot;reserve clause&quot; concept. He testified that the court has not found it necessary to rely on the Ninth Amendment because the liberty clause in the 14th Amendment supports Chief Justice Burger's conclusions about the guaranteed protection for unenumerated rights. This broad understanding of an evolving tradition of liberty is directly at odds with the views of Judge Bork, who gave the term a much narrower reading. Indeed, Judge Bork's view of the Constitution in general as essentially a zero-sum system, in which rights for some necessarily come only at the expense of others, is antithetical to any expansive reading of the liberty clause of the 14th Amendment.    This brings me to what I consider to be the fundamental error in your editorial: your failure to recognize the essential differences between Judge Kennedy and Judge Bork. Let me offer just a few examples, beyond the Ninth Amendment, of the many that could be cited.    First, Judge Kennedy testified that &quot;the concept of liberty in the due process clause (of the 14th Amendment) is . . . quite sufficient . . . to protect the values of privacy that Americans legitimately think are part of their constitutional heritage.&quot; Judge Bork flatly rejected any view of the liberty clause that would protect a right of privacy. In fact, the only privacy rights that Judge Bork acknowledged were limited to the specific, enumerated provisions of the Bill of Rights.    Second, Judge Kennedy said that &quot;privacy is a most helpful noun, in that it seems to sum up rather quickly values that we hold very deeply.&quot; Judge Bork, on the other hand, endorsed the view that the right was &quot;utterly unpredictable.&quot; To Judge Bork, &quot;privacy&quot; was anything but a helpful term, as he was fond of saying &quot;privacy to do what? We don't know. Privacy to take cocaine in private; privacy to fix prices in private; privacy to engage in incest in private?&quot;    Third, Judge Kennedy testified that &quot;there is a substantive component to the due process clause,&quot; of which &quot;the value of privacy is a very important part,&quot; and that the court has been &quot;right&quot; in recognizing such a component. In direct contrast, Judge Bork stated that substantive due process was &quot;a pernicious constitutional idea.&quot;    Fourth, while Judge Kennedy expressly agreed that there is a marital right to privacy protected by the Constitution, Judge Bork testified that he had never worked on a constitutional argument that would support such a right. And along these same lines, while Judge Kennedy testified that &quot;if you were going to propose a statute or hypothetical that infringed upon the core values of privacy that the Constitution protects, you would be hard put to find a stronger case than Griswold (v. Connecticut (1965)),&quot; Judge Bork wrote that Griswold was an &quot;unprincipled&quot; decision without any supportable method of reasoning.    In my view, your editorial attempted to rewrite Judge Kennedy's testimony with a Bork script, and thereby create a basis for arguing, should Judge Kennedy be confirmed, that the right succeeded in filling Justice Powell's seat with a person committed to Judge Bork's core ideas. The editorial ignored, however, the fundamentally different views each has of the Constitution and its proper interpretation.    Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D., Del.)
