Under Ray R. Irani, the 56-year-old chemist who succeededDr. Hammer, the company has sold operations that providedmore than $10 billion in annual revenue, swept $2.3 billionof long-term debt from its balance sheet, lopped its dividendby 60% and shed more than half of its 55,000 employees.</LP><TEXT>   On Wall Street, the company is courting institutionalinvestors who once shunned it. Analysts say the companyprovides financial details it once withheld and emphasizes anew predictability. In this sense, &quot;the difference in thiscompany is night and day,&quot; says Michael Young, an analyst atSmith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.   But in other important ways, questions still loom. Reducedand rearranged though it may be, Dr. Hammer's once-flamboyantfiefdom will still labor under about $5.7 billion in debt, anunmarketable investment in one of the nation's largestnatural gas pipeline systems and a strong reliance on thecyclical chemical business that is, at the moment, in thedumps.   Surprisingly, the oil business, from which Occidental hadgrown away in recent years, once again is seen as one of itsstrongest hopes -- a return to its beginnings, when a roll ofthe dice on high-risk oil exploration could make thedifference between success and failure.   Musing on these matters in Dr. Hammer's former office,where a nondescript landscape painting and simple desk havereplaced the giant Rubens work on the wall and phalanxes ofautographed photos of world leaders, Dr. Irani cautions thatafter a promised $700 million in additional debt cuts,probably by mid-1992, &quot;until the price of gas improves andthe chemical recession is over, we will not be able to makefurther substantial and meaningful reductions in the debt.&quot;   These days, after disposing of such diverse holdings as agiant loss-making coal mine in China, major oil reserves inthe North Sea and a 50.7% stake in IBP Inc., the largest U.S.purveyor of fresh meat, Occidental is clearly focused. &quot;Ourgame is oil and gas and chemicals,&quot; says Dr. Irani.   Somewhat reluctantly, the company also will retain itsgiant MidCon Corp. natural gas pipeline unit, for which itpaid $2.6 billion in stock in 1986.   &quot;It has been a damned headache,&quot; Dr. Irani concedes. Sincebuying it, Occidental has had to make a further $1.6 billionin special settlement payments to natural gas suppliers, acost that has been tucked into Occidental's now-bloated bookvalue for MidCon rather than expensed as incurred. But MidConprovides a steady cash flow these days, an advantage to acompany that relies on often-volatile oil and chemicalprices. &quot;It's the only business we've got that's reasonablypredictable,&quot; Dr. Irani says.   With MidCon's help, Occidental's cash flow will cover itsneeds for capital outlays, debt service and dividendpayments, &quot;even at these lousy levels of natural gas andchemicals prices&quot; the chairman says.   But the &quot;home run potential,&quot; he says, is the company'soil exploration program. With &quot;a world-class oil discovery,&quot;there would be further improvements in the financialstructure.   Occidental has had major successes in foreign exploration.More than 20 years ago it discovered -- and later lost tonationalization -- Libya's giant oil fields. Other findsfollowed, including the rich North Sea reserves. Morerecently, Occidental drilled into the billion-barrel CanoLimon field in Colombia and then sold much of its stake inthe field at a huge gain.   Now the company is hunting with renewed vigor for&quot;elephants,&quot; as giant fields are called in the oil business.Exploration outlays this year will total about $170 million.That's down from the $200 million spent last year, which wasswelled by one-time &quot;bonuses&quot; for acreage; but Occidentalplans to swell outlays by about 10% to 15% annually for theforeseeable future.   The company admits it's a high-risk strategy, but it hopesfor rich returns. As it did in Colombia, Occidental &quot;willcash out early in the game&quot; if a major discovery is made,bringing in cash for debt reduction and further exploration,Dr. Irani says.   Though no major finds have been reported, Occidental'schairman says he is &quot;most enthusiastic&quot; about prospects inYemen and Algeria, where the company is drilling not far fromknown oilfields and where big geological structures maycontain large reserves. In line with its enthusiasm about itsprospects in Yemen, Occidental recently acquired an 18% stakein a neighboring block that is operated by its 48%-ownedCanadian subsidiary.   Meanwhile, the chemical business has assumed aproportionately greater role at Occidental just as the markethas soured. It now accounts for roughly half the revenue inthe newly trimmed company, compared with about 25%previously. Although an efficient producer, Occidental issuffering along with the rest of the industry.   Prices for polyvinyl chloride resins and high-densitypolyethylene -- important products for Occidental -- skiddedas much as 20% this summer from year-earlier levels. Chlorineprices were off by a half. Prudential Securities Inc.recently lowered its earnings forecast for Occidental to $1 ashare this year from $1.25, predicting that chemical profitwill slide 29% to $435 million from $610 million.   Overall, Occidental last year had a net loss of $1.7billion, or $5.82 a share, after $2.05 billion in one-timecharges for asset write-downs. Revenue totaled $22.06billion.   Although prices of some building-block chemicals have beenrising in recent weeks, raw materials costs are risingfaster, squeezing profits. At best, &quot;the recovery is lookingmore like a lazy `L' than a `V,&quot;' says William R. Young, ananalyst at Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Inc.   Worries also seem to be awaiting Occidental at theDepartment of Energy, where charges of evading oil pricecontrols between 1973 and 1981 still linger. Occidentalthought it had settled the matter a year ago for about $444million. But the settlement was overturned, and Occidental'sliability could theoretically total $1 billion or more.   Despite the problems, early indications are thatOccidental's weight-reduction program is working. Dr. Iranisays profit from operations this year, excluding thenonrecurring restructuring charges, will be &quot;significantlyhigher&quot; than the $351 million, or $1.18 a share, earned lastyear on the same basis.   Third-quarter results, however, may be &quot;difficult,&quot; Dr.Irani says. Gains from the $1.5 billion sale of Occidental'sNorth Sea oil properties, which would otherwise make for aspectacular quarter, won't all make their way to the bottomline, he says, declining to elaborate. Analysts speculatethat the gain may in part be offset by nonrecurring charges,including a possibile reserve for a settlement with theEnergy Department.   Investors thus far have supported Dr. Irani's diet forOccidental. From barely $17 a share on the eve of Dr. Irani'sJanuary announcement of restructuring plans, Occidental'sstock has risen by more than a third.   Among the believers is Milwaukee-based Strong/CorneliusonCapital Management Inc., which this year through its StrongFunds bought 952,000 shares of Occidental at about $18 to $22a share. &quot;We always thought the company had a lot of value init,&quot; says William Corneliuson, a partner in the firm. But, hesays, &quot;The leap of faith is that Occidental is in many waysas much a chemical company, as much an oil company, and thequestion is how much gain the chemicals business can get froman economic recovery.&quot;   Some reach a different conclusion. &quot;Even when therestructuring is all said and done, Occidental will havenearly $6 billion in debt on its books and a highly leveragedposition in the chemicals business, which is on a downwardslope,&quot; says Mr. Young of Smith Barney. &quot;The real betinvestors are making is that Oxy will be successful with thedrill bit.&quot;   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM Corp. reached a proposed settlementwith the Department of Energy in 1989 to pay a total of $205million over eight years related to alleged violations of oilprice controls by a subsidiary.
