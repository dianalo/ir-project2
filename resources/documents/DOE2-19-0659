Laboratoryenergy range of the beams of He/sup q/{sup +}, Ar/sup q/{sup +} (q =1, 2) ions are (70--170) x q keV. The optical measurement was performedby Optical multichannel Analysis System, the wavelength range coveredwas 200--800 nm. Different processes of excitation have been observedin single and double charged ions collisions with atoms. The dependenceof emission cross sections on the charge number of incident ions andpotential energy defect is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
