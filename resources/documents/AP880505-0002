CAMPBELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Urban League on Thursday issuedan agenda for economic and social change, saying presidentialcontenders should be evaluated on their commitment to reverse eightyears of leadership by an ``activist against civil rights.''   ``This document presents an agenda for change because it willmake America's neglected poor people ... full participants in ournation's economic and social life,'' said league President John E.Jacob.   ``What we are trying to do with this document is to force thecandidates to tell us where they stand on critical issues as theyrelate to our community,'' Jacob said.   The group issued a report entitled, ``Black Americans and PublicPolicy: Perspectives of the National Urban League.''   Jacob said the league hopes to help black voters evaluate thepresidential candidates and to influence the Democratic andRepublican party platforms. Those platforms should be ``designednot only to attract the black vote but designed to address blackneeds.''   ``We believe civil rights and social justice to be an agendaitem on any president's program,'' Jacob said. ``An agenda item inthe sense that the pulpit of the presidency is used as a bullypulpit to be an advocate, an activist president on the behalf ofcivil rights.''   He said the greatest achievements in civil rights occurredduring administrations in which the president expressed such acommitment.   ``The last eight years have also indicated that when we have apresident who is an activist against civil rights, we've had thegreatest moving back on these kinds of issues,'' he said.   Jacob called for full employment programs, including jobtraining targeted to the most disadvantaged, and increasededucational services to help black youth.   ``This is the work force that this nation will be depending uponin the future,'' he said.   He also urged presidential leadership on welfare reform, sayingthe issue cannot be left totally to the Congress.   ``We need a president who is articulating the need to eradicatethe dependency phase of welfare reform and provide an opportunityfor people to graduate into independence through training, througheducation, through skill development,'' he said.   Jacob also stressed the need for development of a black economicagenda to help foster a business class and increase economicstability in the black community and ``close the wage and thewealth gap that exists between the races.''</TEXT></DOC>
