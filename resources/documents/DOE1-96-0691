Theforce is calculated according to the ratio of the magnetization of theliquid to the strength of the magnetic field and the ratio of the particlesize to the characteristic distance over which the magnetic field varies.The model can be used for calculating the trajectories of particles undergoingmagnetic separation and for calculating the optimal parameters of theseparator itself.</TEXT></DOC>
