MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   There's an ethics and pay quandary waiting forCongress this fall _ and a session that began with the prospect ofa sharp salary increase could end in what amounts to a freeze.   It wouldn't be the first. House and Senate salaries once werestalled for 33 years after a pay increase bill that stirred apolitical storm.   James Madison saw it coming when the Founding Fathers were inthe process of creating Congress. At the constitutional conventionin 1787, he observed that to have members ``regulate their ownwages was an indecent thing and might in time prove a dangerousone.''   To review the current bidding, President Bush has offered to``work with Congress'' on a pay raise to substitute for the51-percent increase rejected last winter. That was six weeks ago,when he also proposed legislation to phase out the speechmakinghonoraria members now can accept as outside income.   The game plan in Congress has been to tie restrictions onoutside income to an increase in the $89,500-a-year salary membersnow are paid, putting a spoonful of sugar with the ethics medicine.   A bipartisan House task force is studying the issues, andprobably will suggest next month that Congress tighten its outsideincome restrictions in tandem with a renewed pay raise measure.   Even that formula leaves Democratic leaders wary thatRepublicans might seize any raise as an issue against them, even anincrease endorsed by Bush. That's what happened on the 51-percentraise, although President Ronald Reagan recommended the measure andBush agreed.   GOP campaigners trying to shake the Democratic majority in theHouse figure one way to do it is by working to create a backlashagainst incumbents, most of whom are Democrats. And there's a longrecord to demonstrate that there's no backlash like a congressionalpay backlash.   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W. Va., recounted that record in one ofhis lectures on congressional history, tracing pay hassles to thecurrent one _ and noting that it has revived a moribund,200-year-old constitutional amendment that would delay theeffective date of any raise until after the next congressionalelections. Twenty-eight of the required 38 states have voted toratify the pay amendment.   For its first 20 years, Congress paid its members at the rate of$6 a day and $6 for every 20 miles traveled to get there and homeagain. Byrd said that worked out to $900 or $1,000 a year incongressional salaries.   In 1816, Congress voted in an annual salary of $1,500, spurredby purported reformers who argued that members were dragging outspeeches and thus sessions in order to collect higher pay at theday rate. That produced an outcry and an issue that led towholesale defeat of incumbents, which prompted the survivors torepeal it. They upped daily pay to $8, and it was frozen there for38 years.   The first annual salaries, of $3,000, were voted in 1856. In1873, Congress voted to raise that to $7,500 _ and to make itretroactive for two years. President Ulysses S. Grant signed it,doubling his own pay in the process.   That backlash was explosive, despite congressional argumentswith a familiar ring. Sen. Matthew Carpenter of Wisconsin said hisconstituents didn't want him to live in a garret on crackers andcheese and dress in goatskins. He said they knew that a bankcashier or insurance company president couldn't be hired for lessthan $10,000. ``They believe a senator ought to have as much brainsas a cashier of a bank or president of an insurance company,'' hesaid.   The ``salary grab'' was the dominant issue in the next election.Carpenter was one of the casualties.   That raise was repealed and it was 33 years before Congressrisked voting itself another one.   It put salaries back at $7,500, where they stayed for the next18 years. In 1925, the Senate boosted pay to $10,000 with alate-night amendment, passed with no debate. The House agreed,avoiding a roll call vote.   Congress cut its pay during the Depression, restored it beforeWorld War II, but didn't get another raise until 1946. In 1955,amid an economic boom, Congress boosted its pay to $22,500, an80-percent raise, with little political fallout.
