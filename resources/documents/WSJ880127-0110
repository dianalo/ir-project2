Carley (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> UTX GE </CO><IN> ARO AIR </IN><TEXT>   In a stunning reversal of industrial fortunes, General Electric Co. has wrested huge segments of the global, multibillion-dollar market for commercial jet aircraft engines from United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt andamp; Whitney group.    For more than 30 years Pratt andamp; Whitney dominated the market. But in 1985 GE shipped more commercial-airliner engines than Pratt andamp; Whitney for the first time. Since then it has increased its lead in shipments. In 1986 it overtook Pratt andamp; Whitney in dollar sales, and its lead in new orders is growing. Says Harry Gray, United Technologies' former chairman: &quot;GE has been eating Pratt's lunch.&quot;    Pratt andamp; Whitney is vigorously defending its market. It remains a strong competitor, industry officials say, and Pratt andamp; Whitney executives vow to regain the No. 1 position. But the turnabout in the engine business, says Christopher Demisch, a First Boston Corp. securities analyst, locks Pratt andamp; Whitney and GE into &quot;a long, tough fight&quot; for market share. A Pratt andamp; Whitney comeback won't be easy, if only because airline customers, once having decided on engine orders for new planes, rarely switch suppliers.    The stakes are huge. In the next decade, global sales of commercial and military engines and spare parts will reach nearly $160 billion, according to a Pratt estimate. Though commercial sales will account for just under half that, they are far more profitable than military business.    The turnabout stems from a series of events, some stretching back years and some still unfolding. The story is one of corporate gambles that didn't pay and the deft exploitation of an opponent's weaknesses. During Mr. Gray's tenure at United Technologies, the company bet billions of dollars on two new engines that, so far at least, aren't paying off. Mr. Gray canceled a third engine project, leaving a gaping hole in Pratt andamp; Whitney's line that fancy engineering footwork permitted GE to fill.    A recent record of slipshod service, especially tardiness in supplying spare parts, has also damaged Pratt andamp; Whitney. No mere inconvenience, the late arrival of needed parts can disrupt airline maintenance and flight schedules, inflating costs and enraging passengers -- and executives. Robert Daniell, the chairman of United Technologies, recently got a blistering letter of complaint from Steven Rothmeier, the chairman of Northwest Airlines.    &quot;We were living hand-to-mouth on spares from Pratt,&quot; Mr. Rothmeier says in an interview. &quot;I told Daniell that we need a permanent fix for this problem, not just a Band-Aid.&quot;    Japan Air Lines executives also have been upset with Pratt andamp; Whitney's service. At one point, because of a lack of Pratt andamp; Whitney parts, not one of JAL's 40 spare engines for its 747 fleet could operate. &quot;If you repeatedly let one of your best customers down,&quot; says a senior JAL official, &quot;they go someplace else.&quot;    JAL hadn't bought a GE engine in 25 years. But in October, it switched to GE from Pratt andamp; Whitney as its supplier for new 747 engines, partly because of the spare-parts problem. This was a major blow to Pratt andamp; Whitney. JAL flies 60 of the big jets, the biggest 747 fleet in the world.    Pratt andamp; Whitney entered the commercial jet age in the late 1960s with a near-monopoly on the engine business. Early Boeing and McDonnell Douglas jets used only Pratt andamp; Whitney engines. But GE had pioneered some military jet engines and, using this technology, took on Pratt andamp; Whitney in the commercial market. Britain's Rolls-Royce also made commercial jet engines and remains a distant No. 3.    Airline executives were skeptical of GE's early efforts. &quot;Many of them thought of us only in association with light bulbs,&quot; says a GE official. GE nevertheless supplied the engine for the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, which sold widely, giving GE a broad beachhead.    Pratt andamp; Whitney, meanwhile, faced agonizing decisions as the 1980s began. Boeing had launched production of an odd-sized plane, the 757. GE and Pratt andamp; Whitney each were producing two basic engines: a big high-thrust engine and a small one. To power the 757, Pratt andamp; Whitney had either to produce a new, midsize engine, requiring a manufacturing investment of nearly $1 billion, or abandon the market to Rolls-Royce. Mr. Gray heeded Boeing's predictions that the 757 would sell in huge numbers and took the risk. GE didn't follow suit.    Then Mr. Gray took another risk. GE had leapfrogged Pratt andamp; Whitney in some technical areas, making GE engines cheaper to build. (Pratt andamp; Whitney even bought a GE engine and tore it apart to see how GE was doing it.) So Mr. Gray decided to replace Pratt andamp; Whitney's big engine with another brand-new engine, a second billion-dollar gamble. &quot;We didn't have much choice -- GE had left Pratt in the dust,&quot; Mr. Gray says, so far as bringing down manufacturing costs was concerned. He also concluded that the new engine would give Pratt andamp; Whitney a sales edge with airlines; it would boast lower fuel consumption than GE's big engine.    To help finance his new engine projects, Mr. Gray stopped development of a new, small Pratt andamp; Whitney engine. Pratt andamp; Whitney just couldn't afford yet another gamble, he says. But the decision would haunt the company later.    In the past three years, Pratt andamp; Whitney's new midsize engine has gone into service on Boeing 757 jets flown by carriers such as Northwest and Delta -- but the engines have encountered a host of troubles.    Northwest has given Pratt andamp; Whitney a list of 20 items to fix. The engines, for example, suck up sand spread on icy runways, causing premature wear and expensive engine removals for extra maintenance. &quot;We've been vacuum-cleaning the runways,&quot; complains one Northwest man. Nor has it helped that the extra maintenance -- requiring extra parts -- has come just when Pratt andamp; Whitney was falling behind in deliveries of spare parts.    To make matters worse for Pratt andamp; Whitney, the anticipated huge market for its midsize power plant has failed to materialize. Sales of 757s have been tepid -- partly because falling fuel prices have damped the allure of its engine's vaunted fuel savings. So far only 119 757s with Pratt andamp; Whitney engines have been ordered.    For its part, Pratt andamp; Whitney admits to some service lapses. Deliveries of spare parts, some of which are highly complex and take a year to produce, have been late, the company concedes. Pratt andamp; Whitney has been swamped by the current boom in air travel, which has left airlines clamoring for supplies to maintain engines. At Pratt andamp; Whitney, sales of commercial spare parts doubled to $1.6 billion last year from two years earlier. &quot;There were times we couldn't make the parts fast enough,&quot; admits Arthur Wegner, Pratt andamp; Whitney's president.    But surging demand was especially burdensome for Pratt andamp; Whitney. Its 17,000 engines in service (triple GE's number) include 60 different models, multiplying the number and types of spare parts needed. Pratt andamp; Whitney is scurrying to increase parts inventories. It also plans to streamline its hodgepodge of models so that it can stock more of fewer types of parts.    The company dismisses bugs in its midsize engine as the sort common to new engines and vows they will be fixed. The glitches, however, are hurting sales of its new big engine, which began service a few months ago on Pan American World Airways and Singapore Airlines jets. The big engine employs technology developed for Pratt andamp; Whitney's midsize engine, and some airline executives worry that the same problems may crop up. This is a groundless worry, Pratt andamp; Whitney says. &quot;You can bet everything I learn on {the midsize unit} I will instantly fix&quot; on the big engine, says Selwyn Berson, a vice president of the company.    GE isn't saddled with new-engine worries. Instead of developing new engines, its engineers have been grinding away at improving older units. With break-in bugs eliminated long ago, GE salesmen have been touting their engines' reliability.    This was ultimately to give GE an edge in negotiations with Japan Air Lines, which in 1986 began shopping for an engine for a longer-range version of its 747 jumbo jet. At the outset, one JAL faction favored Rolls-Royce; another favored Pratt andamp; Whitney. But GE's reliability pitch struck a responsive chord. &quot;We are an island nation; we must have reliable aircraft to maintain links with the rest of the world,&quot; says one JAL man.    Safety questions also figured in the reliability discussions. The new 747 will have a two-man crew instead of the usual three, and JAL pilots worried about the prospect of handling in-flight engine failures with a smaller crew. The Japanese are ultrasensitive about safety anyway. &quot;When JAL has an accident, somebody has to fall on his sword,&quot; says one U.S. engine salesman.    Sensing victory, GE executives revved up their sales campaign. Jack Welch, the chairman of GE, and Edward Hood, vice chairman, talked to JAL officials in Tokyo. Meanwhile, JAL officials were fuming over Pratt andamp; Whitney's late spare-parts deliveries, which had repeatedly disrupted JAL maintenance work. Then the airline's powerful engineering group completed its technical evaluation of the competing engines. GE's came in first, Rolls's second and Pratt andamp; Whitney's third, industry officials say. JAL gave its order to GE.    GE has also scored triumphs with its small engine. Built in a joint venture with Snecma of France, it sold poorly in the 1970s. But a few years ago GE engineers managed to squeeze it under the wing of the small Boeing 737 by designing a unique oval engine casing that permitted adequate ground clearance. New Boeing 737s powered by the GE engine have become the hottest-selling jets in the world. Nearly 800 have been sold.    Pratt andamp; Whitney doesn't have a small engine to rival GE's, thanks to Mr. Gray's cancellation of the small-engine project. Belatedly, Pratt andamp; Whitney is scrambling to fill this gap in its product line. With its financial and technical resources strained developing its midsize and big engines, Pratt andamp; Whitney set up a joint venture with Rolls-Royce and other European and Japanese companies to develop a small engine, the V2500. But the section of the engine being built by Rolls doesn't run very well. In ground tests, parts keep fracturing and flying apart.    Pratt andamp; Whitney officials are furious. &quot;Incompetent,&quot; is the way one top Pratt andamp; Whitney man recently described Rolls. But a spokesman for the joint venture says recent tests show that the Rolls section -- redesigned for the third time -- will work.    If it doesn't, it could mean delays for V2500-powered jets ordered by Pan Am and Lufthansa. At best, the engine already lags far behind GE's small engine in the sales race.    Yet the tide could turn in Pratt andamp; Whitney's favor. As bugs are worked out of its new engines and if fuel prices soar, airlines may snap up its products. And there is no doubt Pratt andamp; Whitney will fight to regain lost business. Says Mr. Wegner, the company's president: &quot;The day we lost at JAL was the first day of our campaign to win JAL back.&quot;    ---                The Pratt-GE Jet-Engine Battle              1982    1983    1984    1985    1986    1987 Airliner engines shipped Pratt         480     384     455     360     432     425 GE            314     293     290     420     513     524 New Orders Pratt        N.A.     409     482     484     494     467 GE             45      60     585     880     675   1,360 Civil and military engine sales (in billions of dollars) Pratt        $5.3    $5.2    $5.4    $5.3    $5.5    N.A.
