In Moscow, workers bustled about their jobs on a sunny but coldspring day.   The official Tass news agency said nearly 150 million peopleturned out for the subbotnik that would provide millons of rublesfor building clinics, hospitals, schools, libraries, clubs andstadiums. The oncologic and cardiologic centers in Moscow werebuilt with subbotnik funds, according to Tass.   Subbotniks have become a part of Soviet life since the first onein April 1919 when fifteen workers at a Moscow railway depotvoluntarily repaired a steam locomotive without additional pay. Afew days later, after word had spread of the deed, many Moscowworkers put in a day at their usual jobs without pay.   Vladimir I. Lenin, founder of the Soviet state, joined in theexpanded subbotnik in 1919. The annual subbotniks now are held on aSaturday close to Lenin's birthdate of April 22, 1870.   But subbotniks also can be held to commemorate other dates, suchas the anniversary of the founding of the Soviet state in 1917 andthe defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945.   There have been complaints about bosses who forced unpaid workdays on workers.   The Literaturnaya Gazeta in December said a Volgograd woman wasasked to resign from her job at a wood processing plant after shewrote a letter to a newspaper saying subbotniks sometimes wereimposed rather than being a voluntary contribution to the publicgood.   Tass reported, also in December, that a group of factoryemployees objected to being ordered into the plant on Saturdays tomake up for production problems during the week. The report saidthat over a one-year period, workers were told to report for workon 20 Saturdays.</TEXT></DOC>
