Schlender (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> TATE DEC </CO><IN> EDP </IN><TEXT>   Ashton-Tate Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. will announce today plans to co-develop versions of Ashton's popular dBASE personal computer database manager software for Digital's line of minicomputers.    The agreement underscores Ashton's stated strategy to bring its dBASE programs to computers other than personal computers. It also complements products under development with Microsoft Corp. and Sybase Inc. to allow smaller networks of personal computers to share a common database. The Digital products will enable database information to be shared throughout a corporate system of thousands of terminals, personal computers and workstations.    &quot;Four out of five Fortune 1000 companies use Digital's equipment,&quot; said Edward M. Esber Jr., chairman and chief executive of Ashton, based in Torrance, Calif. &quot;We think this agreement is a key to proliferating the dBASE language into other databases.&quot;    Digital is catering, in part, to its existing customers, many of whom use dBASE products on personal computers and Digital's Rdb database manager for larger machines. &quot;Our customers would like simpler training for users and consistent programs from the terminal to the PC, to the workstation, to the corporate computing level,&quot; said Henry Ancona, vice president of the business and office information systems group at Digital, based in Maynard, Mass. &quot;This will provide for a common set of database language tools for the whole line.&quot;    The two companies said they will develop at least three dBASE products for Digital's machines: a simple, character-based version to run on so-called &quot;dumb terminals&quot;; a snazzier, graphics-oriented version to run fancier workstations, and a product that will allow personal computers connected to Digital's larger machines to use dBASE commands to process data stored in Digital's Rdb database format.    Digital's sales force will sell the new products, which will be able to run on computers using either Digital's proprietary operating system or machines using its version of Unix, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s popular operating system. Ashton plans to sell a Unix version of the product itself. The companies declined to predict when the first co-developed products would become available.    Separately, Digital will announce today availability of a new file server for networks of personal computers. Called the PCLAN/Server 2000, the $18,000 package includes a MicroVAX 2000 computer that acts as the network file server, plus a special control console and the software necessary to manage data in a network of 16 personal computers. The file servers themselves can be linked into networks, making it possible to tie together hundreds of personal computers, Digital said. </TEXT></DOC>
