 When the machines fail, the systems have helped operators findthe problem and the appropriate remedy.andP;  These systems were developed eitherby the purchasers of the machines, in which case the costs incurred and theneed to recoup the investment led to &quot;invisible&quot; experts used to gain andmaintain a proprietary advantage, or by the equipment manufacturersthemselves, in which case the incurred costs were justified by the enhancedmarketability of the equipment.andP;  In either case, the systems played the roleof &quot;experts from afar.&quot;andM;Like the experts they emulate, these systems mostly use symbolic information(is the Framister in contact with the thingamajig) and the rigid structuresof a particular piece of equipment.andP;  To make these systems more usable,graphical support was incorporated to permit faster identification ofspecific components and their location in or on the machines.andP;  It wasn'tmuch, but it helped us spatially organized thinkers out there.andP;  This type ofsystem can be grouped under the heading of product support systems (PSSs).andM;Experts systems and their roles in industry evolved rather rapidly fromoffering advice in the proper use of a piece of equipment to helping usersmake the best use of the machine under given circumstances.andP;  When tolerancesslip, they've helped operators recalibrate their machines.andP;  The systems noweven help operators make better use of their resources and equipment down thewhole production line; the interaction between designers, engineers, andtheir computer-aided design (CAD) systems is yielding better products thatneed fewer revisions.andP;  One example of this is the engine mounts at Boeingthat were shown, all before a single piece of metal was cast, to haveunboltable and unreachable &quot;blind holes,&quot; in which fastenings could not bemaintained after assembly.andM;The interface for these systems is provided by the CAD systems in which theyare used.andP;  Most of the information is presented graphically.andP;  The level ofpresentation is optimized for the work being performed but can range fromsimple wire-frame drawings to more computationally extensive, and thereforeexpensive, drawings with hidden-line removal, solid modeling, color, shading,multiple illumination sources, and animation.andP;  Other capabilities includevarying degrees of zooms and rotates, mixing of views for an image,a nd theability to present realistic images (which adds enormous overhead to apresentation since reality tends to be fractal, fuzzy, anti-aliased, andotherwise &quot;messy&quot;).andP;  These systems tend to define the presentation ofinformation as the presentation of the objects themselves.andP;  Interactionoccurs at many levels with specialized applications to maintain the variouslevels of object definition and presentation.andM;SMART SYSTEMSandM;The next level of computerized help for manufacturing arrived with the recentintroduction of smart facilities-management systems (FMSs) that verify theproper placement of equipment on the production line, involving all sorts ofrules, regulations, ergonomic considerations, and interference betweenprocesses.andP;  (Having a thermoform machine bonding the covers on frozen-foodpackages next to the flash-freeze broccoli processor is never a good idea.)andO;These systems also schedule maintenance for specific pieces of equipment andcan help design the production line to enhance &quot;up&quot; time by clusteringrouting and staggering maintenance calls; line activities can be routed toalternative equipment and are, therefore, never halted except by disaster.andO;They can also lay out production lines according to the company's materialinventory method.andM;An FMS yields a &quot;barren&quot; floor that looks like poor space utilization but ismuch more productive because material movement is much more effective.andP;  Thereverse is true for &quot;overhead&quot; delivery systems favored by manufacturers withmore stable products, reflected in more stable production lines.andP;  Equipmentcan be packed onto the factory floor more densely but coping with product andline changes becomes an administrative nightmare.andM;FMSs have appeared by enhancing CAD systems (the &quot;D&quot; stands for draftingsystems used by architects) to handle the placement of objects on a grid withvarious constraints.andP;  Their outputs usually resemble floor plans and blueprints.andP;  Advances in CA-Drafting, themselves influenced by advances inCA-Design, result in enhancements to FMS and the latest versions tend towarda realistic simulation of how a facility should look and work when complete.andO;(As a former architecture student who somehow ended up in computers I canattest to the interconnection of these disciplines.andP;  Presentation andinteraction are forcedly similar and can &quot;cross pollinate.&quot;andP;  Some of thesmart in smart-CAD and the techniques to hook them up come from observingFMSs; some FMS presentation ideas originate in CAD.andM;Yet another aspect of factory-floor intelligence can be seen in theprogramming of numerically controlled machines (NCMs), which includeequipment that produces everything from jewels to jeeps.andP;  Programming NCMshas evolved from &quot;follow me&quot; recording of the motions of an operator todirect generation of programs from CA-Design systems.andM;CAD systems modified to generate NCM programs have become intelligent enoughto optimize the programs for the reduction of waste motion.andP;  They alsorecognize impossible options--such as motions through solid objects--thathave helped CAD systems constrain themselves to objects that can be producedby the available equipment.andP;  (Brewing CAD, FMSs, and NCMs together andspicing the recipe with enough processing power results in computerintegrated manufacturing, or CIM, yet another addition to this month'salphabet soup.)andP;  NCMs are related to robotics, though they tend to be muchmore specialized.andP;  A lathe can only turn and place a blade against whateverobject is in its clutches; you'd be surprised at the complex shapes that thissimple tool can achieve.andP;  How do you think Dutch wooden shoes are produced?andM;NCM interfaces tend to reflect their relationship with robotics; they rangefrom &quot;wands&quot; of buttons on a tether to three-dimensional simulations of thetool on screen.andP;  These systems are also becoming very sophisticated.andP;  Theintegration of neural nets with the machine-control mechanisms is yieldingtools that have enough somatic knowledge to select their own traversals.andO;People training or operating this equipment would not choose the same path toarrive at the same position since they have to break the task into discretemotion components and tend to optimize along the chosen direction.andP;  Netsdon't exhibit this bias and the sequence of tool instructions with containmany possible discrete motions often smaller than the path generated bypeople.andP;  The subsequent motion is often smoother, without the jerks andapproximations that make robots look rickety.andP;  The control of end-pointselection often starts from CAD renditions and incorporates corrections forthe state of the tool and machine at run time, sometimes referred tofacetiously as &quot;reality checks.&quot;andP;  The need for feedback introduces vision andscene interpretation into the loop.andM;What is truly surprising about smart-CAD, FMSs, CIM, and PSSs is that onlythe latter are considered AI.andP;  Smart-CAD can, or should, be considered a formof AI that handles the physical realities of objects modeled by theirdrafting specifications.andP;  Similarly, FMSs manage the constraints of thephysical and regulatory environment of the factory floor.andP;  NCMs are beginningto enable tools to manage their own constraints.andP;  And by providing feedbackto a CAD system, determining the feasibility of production according to thegiven specifications is possible.andP;  All of these capabilities are AI-related.andM;CONTINUOUS PROCESSINGandM;We haven't covered continuous process environments in which the productionline is a real-time uninterruptible.andP;  The role of AI in these environmentshas followed pretty much the same path as the production-line environment,with a few differences--continuous processes are real-time environments thatmay serve a multitude of purposes and are thus continuously variable.andM;The petroleum industry is the most visible example of continuous processingat work.andP;  Petroleum, commonly referred to as crude (samples are available ata beach near you), is broken down into usable products such as gasoline andlamp oil by a distillation process called cracking.andP;  (Cracking towers arethose tall things you see at the refinery.)andP;  Petroleum is boiled intoindividual molecules at the base of the tower (some use heat, others usevacuum or pressure differential) and the molecules rise according to theirspecific density.andM;To get specific products, you collect only those molecules that rise to aspecific point in the towers.andP;  You get paraffin at the bottom, gasoline andvarious octanes in the middle, and aerosols and other noxious fumes at thetop, which are usually vented to the outside and burned.andM;Continuous processes have always had better interfaces.andP;  The sheer physicalsize of the plants, as well as the complexity of the inter-connectionsbetween processors, has resulted in extremely sophisticated models.andP;  All ofthe states are represented in enormous schemas through which control isexerted, either by servo-actuation or computer simulation of the object inquestion, be it a valve or a burner.andP;  The major distinction is that while theproducts to be moved through the pipes may differ, the place of the pipesdoes not.andP;  This distinction allows the time to set up the schemas and thestability to use them for control.andM;The role of AI in these environments is in some ways more limited, in otherspotentially more pervasive.andP;  Diagnostic and configuration expert systems areused routinely at failures and reconfiguration times, but the trulyinteresting concept has been demonstrated by a goal-driven desalinationsystem: it tunes and tweaks itself to produce water of consistent quality.andO;What works for water will undoubtedly be applied to more complex molecules.andO;Imagine a plant checking into the production roster at head office andconfiguring itself to produce the required goods!andP;  At this point, the conceptof an interface becomes rather meaningless or rather so charged with meaningthat speech and voice would be the only adequate medium.andP;  Asking the plantquestions about its related state would be as useful as asking someone for astatus report about their spleen.andP;  Questions would only make sense in termsof manufacturing production and requirements.andM;This issue brings us to possible implementation of interfaces that cansupport line and continuous processes.andP;  Almost as many interfaces exist as doproducts.andP;  Software developers might have standardized on windowing schemesand other coarse parameters, but some questions must be answered beforeselecting a scheme.andM;Knowledge representation can occur by symbolic or mimetic mapping.andP;  Symbolicmapping uses logos or words to encode information.andP;  This technique requiresstandardization of conventions used to encode the information, as well as anunderstanding commonly referred to as jargon.andP;  Despite the introduction ofthe side effects of symbolic manipulation, as well as the learning curverequired by the conventions, this method has served our civilizationextremely well and for a very long time.andM;Symbolic mapping is not the only means of representing information.andP;  Mimeticmapping offers a far more intuitive, or at least direct, means of acquiringknowledge.andP;  It does away with the learning curve and the sociologicalassumptions underlying the teaching.andP;  This mapping technique relates what canbe seen with what can be manipulated.andP;  The question becomes simply &quot;What tomap?&quot;andM;OBJECTS AND INTERFACESandM;These types of interfaces are best implemented in object-oriented languages.andO;I've just spent hundreds of hours getting Smalltalk to perform data entryjust like traditional transaction-processing systems.andP;  Writing simpleinterfaces in Smalltalk is harder than writing complex ones; odder interfacesare easier to program in an object-oriented context.andP;  The idea is to let theobjects represent themselves and the application is simply a framework forcreating, locating, and destroying objects.andP;  It was far simpler and quickerto develop a directed acyclic graph for the manipulation of nodes in aknowledge base.andM;Charles-A.andP;  Rovira lives in Ottawa, Ont., Canada.andP;  He can be reached on BIXas crovira, on CompuServe as 71230, 1217, and on Inet-2000 and Envoy/100 asADELPHI.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
