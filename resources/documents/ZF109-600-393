(10BaseT standardfor unshielded twisted pair Ethernet)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Bermar, Amy.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Many Macintosh networking vendors now support the new 10BaseTstandard for unshielded twisted-pair Ethernet or are preparing todo so.andP;  Some users chose to gamble by installing 10BaseT equipmentbefore the standard was established, but it is now firmly in placeand Mac sites can connect their machines via inexpensive telephonewiring.andP;  Many users say that their already-installed cable issuitable for 10BaseT, further reducing the cost.andP;  10BaseT is basedon a central star topology, making it easy to repair or remove anode having problems without disabling the entire network.andP;  Thedisadvantage of this design is the fact that nodes cannot be morethan 100 meters away from the hub.andP;  Coaxial cable allows a node tobe up to 500 meters from the hub.andP;  Those considering installing10BaseT LANs should factor in the cost of multiple network hubs orconcentrators.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Product:   Apple Macintosh (Microcomputer) (Usage).andO;Topic:     10BaseTUnshielded Twisted PairEthernetNetwork ManagementThird-Party Vendors.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Amy BermarandM;For the past few years, network managers like Louis Valles put their jobs andcompany dollars on the line each time they opted to install a 10BASE Tnetwork, because the standard for this implementation of Ethernet overunshielded twisted-pair cable was perpetually in flux.andM;&quot;We took a chance,&quot; said Valles, manager of small systems and networks forthe University of Texas at El Paso, which will spend $1.5 million to link 57buildings with a combination of 10BASE T and fiber-optic cabling.andP;  &quot;Westarted committing to the technology and ordering before the standards becamepublished.andP;  But now it looks as though everything's going to come out OK.&quot;andM;Indeed, the good news for network users is that Valles' early hunch hasproved correct: The 10BASE T standard is firmly in place, and many Macintoshsites that have been using unshielded twisted-pair wiring now have arelatively cheap, higher-speed Ethernet upgrade path.andM;The wagon is rolling.andP;  &quot;When people first buy a Mac, they typically go forLocalTalk,&quot; said Michael Hart, 10BASE T product manager for Cabletron SystemsInc. of Rochester, N.H., which began shipping its Mac Ethernet products ayear ago.andP;  &quot;But the higher-end networks with higher node densities are movingrapidly toward the faster connections.&quot; Ethernet's potential throughput of 10Mbps is more than 40 times that of LocalTalk, although real-life performanceis typically improved only five to six times.andM;&quot;More than 70 percent of the already installed cable is suitable for 10BASET,&quot; said Kevin Woods, marketing manager of 10BASE T and Ethernet products forSynOptics Communications Inc. of Mountain View, Calif.andM;About half a dozen manufacturers have announced or shipped 10BASE T Ethernetcards for the Mac at prices ranging from about $400 to $600.andP;  10BASE T isintended to let users mix components from various vendors, but products basedon earlier drafts of the standard may not work with those based on newerones.andP;  The last draft version was approved in early October after more thanthree years in review.andP;  Any incompatible Ethernet device can be made 10BASE Tcompliant by adding an up-to-date external transceiver, which costs about$150.andM;Circle the wagon wheel.andP;  Because 10BASE T topology is based on a central,star design, a single node having problems can be repaired or removed withoutaffecting the entire network.andP;  However, the convenience of this design withtwisted-wire cabling has a price: The maximum recommended distance between anode and the hub is just 100 meters, one-fifth the distance permitted bymore-expensive coaxial cable.andP;  The cost and placement of these hubs, whichare sold by several dozen DOS vendors as well as a few Macintosh-orientedcompanies, must be included in any installation plan.andM;Hubs, also known as workgroup concentrators, typically contain 12 Ethernetports with RJ-45 connectors and two additional ports for other media ornetwork devices.andP;  Basic units range in price from about $1,000 to $3,000.andM;&quot;You'll spend about 10 times more building an Ethernet connection than youwould a LocalTalk connection,&quot; said Larry Jones, product manager for FarallonComputing Inc.'s network products.andP;  The company has been shipping 10BASE Tproducts since January.andM;Net managers of large sites frequently cite the appeal of intelligent hubs.andO;At the most basic level, these devices monitor network traffic; complexsystems can control and route specific information.andP;  Such features, however,can add several thousand dollars to the price.andM;Vendors who either have announced or are shipping some kind of managementsoftware with their 10BASE T products include Cabletron; Farallon; SynOptics;Asante Technologies Inc. and David Systems Inc., both of Sunnyvale, Calif.;andO;3Com Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif.; NetWorth Inc. of Irving, Texas; and RacalInterLan Inc. of Boxborough, Mass.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
