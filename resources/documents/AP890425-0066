But a lawyer for the James B. Beam Distillery Co. of Deerfield,Ill., said Monday the mother had been repeatedly warned over aperiod of years about the risks of alcohol and she kept drinking upto a half of a fifth of bourbon per day. No warning on the part ofa manufacturer would have persuaded her to stop, the attorney said.   Michael Thorp, the 4-year-old son of Harold and Candace Thorp ofSeattle, was born mentally retarded, neurologically impaired,developmentally stunted and malformed, according to the lawsuitfiled by his parents.   The Thorps contend that the liquor company should have providedlabels warning that alcohol can cause birth defects. In courtpapers, Mrs. Thorp said she didn't know her drinking would damageher child.   The case focuses attention on a federal law taking effect inNovember that will require labels on all beer, wine or hard liquorthat alcohol can cause health problems and birth defects.   In his opening statement Monday, a lawyer for the boy and hisparents, Barry M. Epstein, said Michael was the victim of fetalalcohol syndrome and deserves enough money to take care of him forthe rest of his life.   Epstein said Beam knew about a link between alcohol and birthdefects in 1978 but made no effort to inform the public. Beamdecided, along with 22 competitors, not to place warnings on itsbeverages, Epstein said.   Had warning labels existed and the information been out, theThorps ``could have acted to see what could be done to safeguardthis child,'' he said.   In opening statements by the defense, lawyer Shannon Staffordsaid, ``Family members and doctors tried for years to get Candy tostop drinking. ... (She) ignored every warning she got.   ``Evidence will demonstrate that Candace Thorp was warned notonce but repeatedly'' about the possible effect of alcohol onpregnancy, he said. ``A warning on a bottle label would not havedone any good.''   He also said he will prove that Michael's rate of development isnot much different from that of his older sister, and that hiscondition is due to poor nutrition during pregnancy, heredity, andsevere neglect during his early years by parents who are admittedalcoholics.   In court documents, lawyers for Beam said, ``Beam does notconcede that maternal alcohol consumption causes birth defects.''   An estimated 30,000 children are born each year nationwide withfetal alcohol syndrome, according to a 1982 study by researchers atthe University of Washington's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute.</TEXT></DOC>
