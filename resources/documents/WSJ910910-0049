London shares fell moderately on a hostof anxieties, and Frankfurt equities ended down onSoviet-linked concerns.   In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-stock index, which gained 192.95points Friday, fell 118.62 to 22573.98. In Tokyo on Tuesday,the Nikkei fell 104.18 points to close the morning session at22469.80.</LP><TEXT>   On Monday, the Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of allfirst section issues, which rose 13.97 points Friday, fell4.78 to 1758.58. First section volume was estimated at 300million shares, shrinking sharply from 620.5 million sharesthe previous session.   The Nikkei's decline came on widespread sentiment that theindex would be a bit top-heavy at 23000. The afternoon slidewas pressured partly by sell programs linked to futures.   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-shareindex slumped 14.2 points to 2653.2. Declining sharessurpassed gainers 70-27. The FT 30-share index fell 5.0points to 2088.6. Volume was 345.8 million shares, off from503.3 million shares in the previous session. The Londonmarket was anxious about corporate earnings, potentialblue-chip rights issues and nagging speculation aboutprospects for a November national election in Britain, andstocks were pressured by dollar weakness.   In Frankfurt, weak banking shares helped drag Germanstocks lower in thin turnover. The DAX index ended on itsintraday low of 1633.06, off 13.12 points. Fears about theSoviet Union's ability to maintain foreign debt repaymentsspread through the market, following weekend reports thatMoscow might have to reschedule its debt. That shook theFrankfurt market, because Germany's private banks beargreater exposure than those in any other nation. The weakerdollar also helped push other European bourses lower.   In Asia, stocks were generally weak. Manila shares plunged4.43%, the largest single-day drop in three months, in panicselling as investors unloaded positions on fears of animminent rejection by the Philippine Senate of the U.S.military bases treaty.   Hong Kong stocks' solid declines came on profit-takingafter modest early gains, with the sell-off attributed tounsubstantiated rumors that Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping'shealth was failing. Wellington share prices firmed in acautiously positive reaction to fresh lending-rate cuts bycommercial banks. Seoul's sharp rise stemmed partly fromeasing corporate cash situations, and from reports thegovernment is addressing the nation's economic woes.   In London, the market's downbeat tempo was paced by aleading blue chip, British Aerospace, which plummeted 41pence, or 7.3%, to 518 pence ($8.90). The big industrialgroup, with interests ranging from aircraft to auto making,said it expects full-year profit &quot;well below&quot; that ofindustry forecasts, but it didn't elaborate. In 1990, BritishAerospace had pretax profit of #376 million ($646.2 million).The announcement followed British press speculation that thecompany was preparing to launch a rights issue tomorrow, whenit is scheduled to post first-half results. For 1991,analysts previously forecast British Aerospace would havepretax profit of #250 million to #340 million; on the companyannouncement, one analyst slashed his estimate to #150million.   Marks andamp; Spencer closed at 285.50, down ,1/2. The retailerdenied a British news report that it is consideringwithdrawing from its North American operations, involving thepossible sale of its Brooks Brothers menswear chain in theU.S. Marks andamp; Spencer also has the Kings Super Markets chainof food stores in the U.S. The company said it is continuinga review, begun earlier this year, of its unprofitableCanadian operations.   Bass lost 2 to 985. The brewer agreed to sell 372 pubs toEnterprise Inns Ltd.; the price wasn't disclosed. The latestsale would bring Bass's pub disposal program to more than1,430 sites -- past the halfway mark -- for a total of #240million. In response to a 1989 directive by the Britishgovernment, discouraging extensive pub holdings by brewers,Bass had decided to sell 2,680 pubs. Bass said terms havebeen agreed for additional disposals covering about 400 pubs,though the deals haven't been completed.   In Frankfurt, Kaufhof Holding added 50 pfennigs, or 1%, to499 marks ($290.87). The retailer said it expects to post a33% increase in 1991 per-share earnings to 24 marks and a 21%rise in sales to 17.8 billion marks ($10.4 million). Severalanalysts previously predicted slightly lower growth inearnings per share, to a range of 20.50 to 22.50 marks.   In Paris, Carrefour dropped 22 French francs, or 1.1%, to2,043 francs ($350.58). The supermarket group's first-halfprofit rose 6.7% to 593 million francs ($101.8 million),including capital gains from an asset sale. Revenue climbed17% to 40.64 billion francs, but excluding the Montlaurstores that were acquired in March, the revenue advance was14%. Carrefour reiterated it expects a decline in annualearnings.   In Sydney, Australia andamp; New Zealand Banking Group fell 5cents, or 1.3%, to 3.85 Australian dollars (US$3.04). ANZsaid it is conducting a three-month review ofsupport-function staff numbers, now about 5,500, or 11% ofthe world-wide work force, in an effort to reduceduplication, increase efficiency and cut costs. It didn'telaborate on any staff reduction targets.   North Broken Hill Peko slipped 1 cent to A$2.56. Theforest products and minerals company's operating profit aftertaxes for the year ended June 30 fell 40% to A$78.9 million(US$62.3 million), in line with expectations, and thedividend was cut 8.3% to 11 cents a share.   In Brussels, Bekaert rose 40 Belgian francs to 9,890francs ($279.99). The steelwire group's first-half profitdropped 58% to 173 million francs ($4.9 million), on an 11%decline in sales to 28.26 billion francs. The company blamedworld recession and tough competition in the tire industry,one of its biggest customers. But Bekaert's latest resultsfollow steep losses in the 1990 second half, which led to a454 millionfranc loss for the year.
