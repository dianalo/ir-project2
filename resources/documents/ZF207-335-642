(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>DRAWING A CONSENSUSandM;It has been more than a year since the Open Software Foundation (OSF) wasestablished by Apollo Computer, Digital Equipment Corp., Groupe Bull,Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Nixdorf Computer, and Siemens as a not-for-profit,independent organization chartered to provide the computer industry, in avendor-neutral fashion, with the components of a new software environment.andM;Before OSF was launched in May 1988, a group of representatives from theseven founding companies, known as the &quot;jump-start&quot; team, worked our ofApollo's Chelmsford, MA, headquarters.andP;  As Nixdorf Computer's delegate, I wasable to participate in that effort for the two weeks preceding theannouncement of OSF's formation.andP;  While the final preparations were made, theatmosphere was charged with excitement as we felt we were doing withsomething unique in the computer industry.andM;The jump-start team, composed of approximately 50 individuals from sevencompanies which otherwise considered themselves competitors, accomplished twoextraordinary feats: in only nine weeks' time, it set up a new foundationwith $ 90 million in financial support, and it developed the seven guidingprinciples on which the foundation would be based.andM;These principles continue to serve as the objectives at which all major OSFactivites are aimed:andM;* OSF product offerings are to be based on relevant industry standards.andM;* OSF will use an active, open process to actively solicit inputs andtechnology.andM;* The OSF decision process will be timely and vendor-neutral.andM;* Member companies will have early and equal access to OSF productspecifications and continuing development.andM;* OSF will support hardware-independent implementations.andM;* The foundation will offer stable, equitable licensing terms.andM;* OSF will encourage technical innovation through university researchparticipation.andM;After the organizational launch, it was important for OSF to begin work asquickly as possible.andP;  Accordingly, the decision was made to bring in aninterim team of employees &quot;on loan&quot; from the founding companies, rather thanfirst hiring a president, management personnel, and other administrativeofficers.andP;  It was named interim director of development, and my firstpriority was to staff an interim development group.andM;Because OSF's neutrality was as important in practice as it was to thefoundation's image, I felt the best way to staff the development team was tohave equal numbers of loaned staff from the seven sponsors.andP;  The interim teamwas a blend not only of seven different &quot;corporate cultures&quot;, but of nationalcultures as well, with representatives from France, England, Germany, Spain,Italy, Belgium, Sweden, the US, and Japan.andP;  Each engineer brought a uniqueprofessional history to the group, which fostered exploration of manytechnical areas from many points of view.andM;The first challenge facing the interim staff was to define the procedure fortechnology acquisition.andP;  This process would have to be carried out in avendor-neutral fashion, in clear view of the industry, and with the input ofthe OSF membership.andP;  While committed to an open technology-selection process,however, OSF did not want to become a bureaucratic consensus body incapableof making decisions in a timely manner.andM;In June 1988, the OSF Request for Technology (RFT) process was outlined.andP;  Itwas critical, OSF felt, for this process to operate under time constraintsand with planned, easily recognized milestones, so that all participantswould know their roles and could participate fully.andM;The three major phases of the RFT process are:andM;* Industry search--a global, industry-wide search for the best technology inthe category chosen (this phase ends with the deadline for submissions fromparticipating organizations);andM;* Member review--a review period in which the participation of the entire OSFmembership in active interchange is encourage (this phase ends with atechnology review meeting);andM;* OSF selection--a decision-making period during which the OSF staff reviewsmember input and arrives at a choice of technology providers (this phase endswith the announcement of the choice and the publication of a &quot;rationaledocument&quot;).andM;UNIX's character-based user interface has been the major obstacle in the wayof wider acceptance of UNIX-based systems.andP;  Standardization in the area ofgraphical user interfaces (GUIs) has proved difficult, in spite of the factthat many companies have been at work developing GUIs.andP;  For these reasons,OSF chose user-interface technology as the subject for its first RFT.andM;It was determined that the user interface and toolkit had to be based on theX Window System developed at MIT.andP;  The X Windows server-client architecturewould give users a network-based graphical user interface.andP;  Under X, theactual applications runs on the client side and can be located on any machineon a network--a Cray, a VAX, an Apollo workstation, or whatever.andP;  The Xserver runs locally on a workstation, PC, or X terminal.andP;  The client andserver communicate using the X protocol, which makes it possible to run asimulation on, say, a Cray tied into the network, yet still have all userinteraction and graphical presentation take place on a workstation or PC.andM;This first RFT document was intentionally brief (two pages) and written to beeasily understood.andP;  In addition to specifying X windows version 11 as astandard, the RFT stated that the interface toolkit must be written in ANSI Cand conform to the Posix standard.andP;  Further criteria were included regardinga style guide to ensure consistent applications, portability, productmaturity, native-language support, testing and validation support, and stableand equitable licensing terms.andP;  The actual selection process that resulted inthe OSF GUI is outlined in Figure 1.andM;As many as 25 OSF staff members participated in the RFT process, but most ofthe work was done by a technical selection team.andP;  Again, to maintain balance,the user-interface team was made up of individuals from different companies:Ted Wilson of Hewlett-Packard, HArry Hersh of DEC, Kee Hinckley of Apollo,Ellis Cohen of Siemens, and Tsuneo Yamaura of Hitachi.andM;This team of specialists brought a level of expertise to the selectionprocess that would be impossible to duplicate in a typical single-companydevelopment environment.andP;  The team worked in a neutral setting, removed fromthe competitive pressures of their parent companies.andM;The technical team augmented its own talents working with five outsideconsultants who had access to the same information as the team.andP;  These wereRobert Scheifler of the MIT X Consortium; James Foley, chairman of thedepartment of electrical engineering and computer science at GeorgeWashington University; Muriel Cooper, director of the Visual Language Lab atthe MIT Media Lab; and Patricia Seybold and Michael Milikin, president andvice president, respectively, of Seybold's Office Computing Group Inc.andP;  Thetechnical team met regularly with the consultants to discuss additions to theselection criteria for the OSF GUI.andP;  AS the list of criteria grew, the listof qualified submissions decreased.andM;To understand why OSF made the decision it did, one first has to understandthe three components of a typical user interface: the applicationprogrammer's interface, the behavior of the interface, and the appearance ofthe interface.andM;It is also necessary to recognize a market reality: thousands of Pc users arealready familiar with IBM's Presentation Manager (PM) interface.andP;  These PCusers would benefit from being able to move back and forth easily between anX Windows-based application running in a network and a PM-based applicationrunning on the PC.andP;  Such a capability hinges on the behavior of theinterface.andM;A much-used example of consistency in interface behavior is provided byautomobiles.andP;  Although a Porsche and a Volkswagen look very different, theclutch pedal is located in the same position on both, and you get the sameresult when the pedal is depressed.andP;  A user interface which behaves the wayPresentation Manager does would allow users to drive both PresentationManager and X Windows-based applications easily.andM;The OSF technical staff eventually reached agreement on the technology uponwhich the proposed product would be based.andP;  Since OSF is a developmentorganization that can merge technologies, it was possible to consider ahybrid, and a hybrid of DEC and HP submissions was what we ultimately settledon.andP;  At a meeting held with the team of consultants on the day after thetechnology staff made its choice, we discovered that the consultants hadindependently reached the same decision as the technical team.andM;Timeliness was a very important goal given to OSF by its membership; once wedecided to merge technologies, we had to define a realistic time frame forthe development of the hybrid.andP;  OSF held joint meetings with HP and DECengineers and determined that a hybrid could be engineered and released byJuly 1989.andP;  In January 1989, a development team made up of OSF, DEC, and HPengineers began development of the hybrid.andM;At the same time, a separate business team had been negotiating with DEC, HP,and other companies whose submissions were leading candidates.andP;  As mentionedearlier, one of OSF's major objectives is to provide stable and equitablelicensing terms; therefore, the business terms and conditions under which OSFlicenses its technology are as important as the technology itself.andP;  In a veryshort time (especially considering the size of DEC and HP), OSF had signedlicense agreements with both companies.andP;  The terms of those agreements set anew standard for licensing source code in the open systms arena.andM;On December 30, 1988, less than six months after the initiation of the RFTprocess, the team informed both OSF member companies and the press of itschoice: a user interface, a combination of HP and DEC technologies, to becalled OSF/Motif.andP;  A detailed, 40-page Rationale Document explaining thedecision was made public on January 11, 1989.andP;  (Copies are available fromOSF.)andM;From initial development through product release, &quot;snapshots&quot; of all OSFdevelopment efforts are made available to OSF members who have signed alicense agreement.andP;  For OSF/Motif, such snapshots are taken every few weeksand include not only the developing source code, but also documentation andtest suites.andP;  The goal is to allow read-only, on-line access to the work inprogress, so OSF members have access to the same materials as OSF developers.andM;All OSF members, regardless of their size or the influence they command inthe industry, have the same opportunity to license OSF technology.andP;  Thestructure of the development process allows member companies to monitorprogress, so that they can coordinate the pending OSF release with releasesof their own products.andP;  If an OSF engineer changes a data structure thataffects a member's product, the member can give immediate feedback to OSF.andO;OSF engineers keep the members informed--at meetings and throughspecification updates--of potential changes in structure and interface sothat, at the very least, both OSF and the member companies are aware of theeffect any changes might have on applications.andP;  Equal access to OSF's ongoingdevelopment also allows members to invest their time and money in areas onwhich OSF is not working, to add value in ways they deem will best satisfytheir customers' needs.andM;OSF receive immediate feedback on the changes it makes to its offerings.andO;This feedback is designed to improve the quality of the offerings thatresult, since OSF engineers have the input of other experts in their field.andO;Managing the interruptions and the work load associated with such an opendevelopment process is OSF's greatest challenge, but in the members' view,the benefits accruing therefrom outweigh the costs.andM;OSF/Motif will align with the major goals of OSF by providing aninteroperable, scalable, and portable application environment.andO;&quot;Interoperable systems&quot;, as defined here, are more than just networkedcomputers that share CPU cycles, memory, disk space, and I/O devices.andP;  Inaddition to sharing computer resources, users need to be able to move freelybetween applications running on different computers and operating systems,without having to learn a new user interface.andP;  Many hold the view thatcomputing will be dominated in the future by PCs on the desktop and byUNIX-based systems in the network.andP;  A typical user will simultaneously runPresentation Manager-based applications and network-based applications (viaan X server) on a single PC.andP;  OSF/Motif, with its Presentation Manager-likebehavior, will allow this to take place without undue confusion to the user.andO;This should be a major step toward linking the PC and open-systemscommunities.andM;OSF development is working toward scalability that would allow users to workand applications to run on a wide range of computing hardware, from PCs tosupercomputers.andP;  The Motif product is intended to be the first step towardallowing applications to be &quot;upscaled&quot; to a more powerful, yet stillfamiliar, environment.andP;  Because it will be based on such standards as Posix,ANSI C, and X Windows, Motif will be portable to many differentarchitectures.andM;A number of lessons were learned during the technology-selection process thatresulted in OSF-Motif.andP;  First, it is exciting to work in an environment thatis open to comment from its members, but it is important to balance thedesires of the members against the goals of the organization.andP;  This is bestaccomplished by making the process explicit, so that companies know whentheir input is needed and when they should let OSF go about its work.andM;Second, a technical staff composed of employees borrowed from participatingcompanies is vital to OSF.andP;  It is not feasible to create a team of expertsfor every technology area OSF will consider, but the best people the membercompanies have to offer may well be willing to spend a six-month sabbaticalworking at OSF.andP;  Finally, the foundation offers neutral turf on which peoplefrom different companies can work together, as well as support for neutralityin evaluation and decision-making.andP;  Many engineers working at OSF willdevelop commitments to technologies without regard for their originalaffiliation.andP;  Working with OSF management, and with OSF staff assuming finalresponsibility, engineers can do what they do best.andM;OSF has become a vehicle by which companies can exchange technology andimprove the operating environment of UNIX systems.andP;  The companies thatsubmitted technologies which were not chosen have also gained from theirinvolvement.andP;  They received extensive information about competitors'offerings (often unreleased), as well as valuable feedback on their ownproducts.andM;As an OSF staff member, I had the opportunity to work with a unique andtalented group of people that otherwise would never have been broughttogether.andP;  I recommend that the opportunity be taken by all to whom it isoffered.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
