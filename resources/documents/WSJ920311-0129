Nevertheless, he said, hebelieves the stock market will decline in the next severalweeks, carrying the Dow industrials as low as 3100.   &quot;The market needs to consolidate further before it canregroup and move higher,&quot; he said. Investors can learnsomething in the decline, he added: Watch whether stocks ofcompanies tied to the economic cycle hold up better thangrowth issues. &quot;If cyclical stocks can outperform, they willclearly emerge as the new leaders&quot; of the market, he said.But don't dismiss growth stocks entirely, particularly ifinterest rates decline-which he expects.   Stocks apparently also got a boost yesterday from thepayment of billions of dollars of dividends, some of whichpresumably flow back into the stock market throughreinvestment. Many major corporations make their quarterlydividend payments on the 10th day of each quarter's thirdmonth, making an estimated $10 billion suddenly available forreinvestment.   In major market action:                                                                                                          Stock prices rallied. Volume totaled 194.5 million shareson the New York Stock Exchange, where 1,076 issues rose and630 fell.                                                                                                          Bond prices slipped on technical factors. The Treasury'sbenchmark 30-year issue lost more than a quarter of a point,or more than $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield onthe issue rose to 7.9%.                                                                                                          The dollar rose.
