An unthinkable idea at the time, atom-splitting was later callednuclear fission and used to produce nuclear power and the atomicbomb.   It brought Otto Hahn a 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry. A yearlater, the bombing of Hiroshima turned his triumph to shock andself-blame.   ``I was shocked and depressed beyond measure,'' Hahn wrote in hisautobiography. ``The thought of the unspeakable misery of countlessinnocent women and children was something that I could scarcelybear.''   Hahn, Austrian physicist Lise Meitner and chemist FritzStrassmann began their work after experiments by others whobombarded uranium with neutrons. Neutrons, along with protons andelectrons, are building blocks of atoms.   Starting in 1934 with research by physicist Enrico Fermi,scientists were reporting varying answers about what elements wereproduced as a result of that bombardment. Hahn and colleaguesdecided to get to the bottom of that question.   The historic experiment began the evening of Dec. 16, 1938, withanother bombardment of uranium. As Hahn and Strassmann worked toidentify the new atoms that resulted, ``we were faced by somethingdistinctly odd,'' Hahn said.   To help in identifying the minute quantities of new atoms, thescientists had been mixing in the element barium, which would grabonto similar atoms. The barium latched onto some newly createdatoms, meaning they were either radium or barium. Barium was out ofthe question, according to theory at the time. To produce barium,the bombardment would have had to split the atoms.   But further experiments left no doubt.   On Dec. 21, Hahn and Strassmann finished a hastily writtenmanuscript that announced their results, but cautiously. ``Aschemists,'' Hahn said, ``we hesitated to announce a revolutionarydiscovery in physics.''   The theoretical explanation came from Meitner and her nephew,physicist Otto Frisch, who realized the uranium atom had split likea wobbling raindrop that finally breaks into two. They also realizedthat the splitting released an enormous amount of energy. The energyfrom just one ounce of uranium could supply the average Americanhousehold with electricity for 70 years.   The news spread quickly. Frisch had barely begun telling Danishphysicist Niels Bohr on Jan. 3, 1939, when Bohr struck his foreheadand exclaimed, ``Oh, what fools we have been! We ought to have seenthat before!''</TEXT><HEAD>Teddy Bear Helps Regulate Premature Infants' Breathing</HEAD><DATELINE>STORRS, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When month-old Vito Colucci snuggles up tothe baby-blue teddy bear in his incubator, he's getting more thancreature comfort.   Vito, born 13 weeks premature, also is learning how to breathe.   The hand-sewn, sheepskin bear in the isolette at the Universityof Connecticut Health Center in Farmington has a balloon in itsabdomen connected to a mechanical air pump so the bear mimics thedeep, gentle inhaling and exhaling of a healthy, sleeping person.   A research project under way at the university and St. FrancisHospital and Medical Center in Hartford has shown that the bears canhelp regulate breathing by inducing deep, quiet sleep in preemies,who frequently suffer respiratory disorders, said Evelyn Thoman, thebehaviorist who designed the project.   ``This is a stimulation that I call biologically relevant,''Thoman said. She came up with the idea about 15 years ago andexperimented on rat pups deprived of their mothers. Those given asurrogate mother _ a warm, moist, pulsating tube _ survived. Thosewithout a surrogate died.   Premature infants were a natural subject for the study, sincethey too are separated from their mothers when they are isolated inan incubator.   Her experiment is based partly on the physics principle ofentrainment, which holds that all pulsating or beating objects,animate and inanimate, tend to match the rhythms of nearby objects.The phenomenon explains why a half-dozen grandfather clocks on thesame wall eventually will synchronize.   Thoman theorizes that the bears may calm colicky babies, and thataside from helping infants learn to breathe the bears stimulatebrain development by letting the babies choose when to snuggle up tothe toys.</TEXT><HEAD>Horticultural Whodunnit: Who killed Wurzell's Wormwood?</HEAD><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wurzell's Wormwood didn't count for much when itwas alive in the wild, but it's at the center of a controversy nowthat it's gone.   ``Something that's completely new to the world, in its onlylocality, just wasn't looked after,'' lamented Brian Wurzell, theplant's discoverer.   Wurzell's Wormwood, Artemesia wurzellii, was the pride and joy ofthe ecological consultant and botanist who in August 1987 discoveredit growing on a 2-square-yard plot in a park in north London. Hisinstincts told him it was something new, and tests at LeicesterUniversity proved him right.   He reported his discovery to the park authority, ``and I assumedfrom then on that the plant would be safeguarded,'' Wurzell said. Ona recent visit, ``I found to my horror it had been dumped on. It wasno longer there.''   The loss is also mourned by Clive Stace, a botany professor atLeicester University and president of the Botanical Society of theBritish Isles.   ``This was notified to the people in charge of this site,'' saidStace. ``They agreed that it was interesting and they agreed to lookafter it and not harm it, and then some twit dumped something onit.''   Lea Valley Regional Park Authority says it will get to the rootof things.   Artemisia wurzellii was a hybrid of two common species, onenative to Britain, the other Chinese. Such hybrids aren't rare; the2,500 flowering plant species found in the British Isles havespawned some 700 hybrid, he said.   But Wurzell's discovery piqued botanists' interest because of itsunusual genesis _ its parents normally flower at different times ofthe year.   ``It's a rather ugly, scruffy-looking green plant'' with smallbrownish-greenish flowers, Stace said. ``It is not at allattractive. Its interest is totally scientific as opposed toaesthetic.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Dec. 15</NOTE></DOC>
