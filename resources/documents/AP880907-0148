Chairman L. William Seidman.   Commercial banks earned $10.5 billion in the first and secondquarters this year, topping the $9.7 billion in net income for thesecond and third quarters of 1985, which had been the mostprofitable six months since the FCIC began keeping track in 1934.   In the first half of last year, banks lost $5.4 billion. The bigloss was almost entirely attributable to huge reserves set aside bythe largest banks for expected losses on loans to Third Worldcountries.   Banks haven't seen the need to build those reserves further thisyear and are thus earning strong profits. Banks set aside $916million on foreign laons in the first six months of this year,compared with $16.4 billion in the same period a year ago.   ``We think ... we will see record profits for the year if theeconomy continues on its current level,'' said Seidman, whoseagency insures commercial banks deposits up to $100,000. The mostprofitable year for banking was 1985, when the industry postedearnings of $18.1 billion.   The April-June period of 1988 was the second most profitablequarter on record, after the July-September quarter of last year,when banks reported $5.8 billion in net income.   However, the banking picture remained bleak in Texas, a statetroubled by soured real estate prices and a depression in the oilindustry. Banks there lost $2.9 billion in the first half, with$2.3 billion of that attributable to a single institution: FirstRepublicBank Corp. of Dallas, which has since been rescued with $4billion in federal money.   Elsewhere in the oil-dependent Southwest, banks earned modestprofits.   Seidman said he hoped that the condition of banks in Texas wouldimprove now that so many have been closed or merged with healthierinstitutions. At the end of August, 173 banks had failed orrequired government assistance to stay open. Ninety-seven of those_ including 42 First RepublicBank subsidiaries _ were in Texas.   Seidman said failures would continue at the same rate this year,setting a post-Depression record, but then decline next year.   In the Midwest, battered earlier in the decade by farm bankfailures, the profitability of most banks has been restored. In thefirst half, 7 percent of banks in Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota,Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota lost money,compared with nearly double that amount a year ago.   Farm losses caused by this year' drought may check theimprovement in banks in the region, but Seidman said Midwesternbanks should be able to weather any difficulties because they'velent more carefully than in the past and because of government aidto farmers.   Other figures cited by the FDIC include:   _The number of unprofitable banks has dropped from 2,243 in thefirst six months of 1987 to 1,729 this year.   _Banks on the FDIC's problem list dropped from a peak of 1,601at mid-year 1987 to 1,455 on June 30 of this year.   _The total of bad loans, those on which payments are not beingmade, totaled $73.4 billion in the second quarter, 3 percent lessthan a year ago.   _Bank lending in real estate and to consumers grew at theexpense of traditional commercial loans to business. Much of theexpansion in real estate loans was to build commercial projectssuch as offices and shopping centers. Much of the growth inconsumer lending was in home equity loans.   Seidman also noted that growth in commercial bank depositsbarely matches inflation and is not keeping up with growth in theeconomy. Meanwhile, deposits at savings and loan institutions havegrown twice as fast, he said. Many insolvent Sandamp;Ls, which have notyet been closed by regulators, are paying high interest rates inorder to attract depositors.</TEXT></DOC>
