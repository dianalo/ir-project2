Patients' ages varied from1.5-67 years. In all cases diagnosis was determined from clinical andradiological data, and in five cases clear histological evidence wasobtained. In 8 cases a ventricular-atrial shunt (VAS) had to be relievepressure on the brain. A total radiation dosage of 55-60 Gy was givenwith 6-7 weeks and with 1.8 Gy as single dosage. Five surviving patientsshowed no sign of relapse at examination between 1 and 8 years later.Further studies are needed to determine whether stereotaxic methods,and possibly in combination with hyperthermia, could be used to improvediagnosis, therapy and survival.</TEXT></DOC>
