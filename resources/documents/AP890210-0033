Bush's $90 billion rescue package to take control of theremaining insolvent Sandamp;Ls and pay off their depositors would requireat least $40 billion from taxpayers over the next 10 years.   While acknowledging that taxpayers ultimately will bear a burden,many lawmakers say they first want federal prosecutors to recover asmuch as possible through forfeitures and fines from what Sen.Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., called the ``go-go boys who perpetratedthis outrageous fraud.''   Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, where the biggest portion ofthe fraudulent Sandamp;L lending cases have occurred, agreed withThornburgh that ``you might not get blood out of a turnip, but youcan get some satisfaction.''   ``The plain truth is that the real crooks have long left the Sandamp;Lbusiness,'' Gramm said. ``But we want you to find your meanest andtoughest prosecutors and go after these people.''   Rep. Paul K. Kanjorski, D-Pa., on Thursday asked the GeneralAccounting Office to review Bush's plan and whether the $50 billionin higher insurance premiums that it would impose on Sandamp;Ls and bankswill drive more of them into insolvency.   Thornburgh blamed fraud, embezzlement and other insider abusesfor 25 percent to 30 percent of the Sandamp;L failures, sayingwhite-collar crime in the industry was responsible for $2 billion inlosses in 1988 alone.   ``There are clearly institutions where active criminal activityhas been the primary source of the failure of the institution orlosses to the point that it had to be taken over,'' he said.   But he said he could not guarantee that the 600 new prosecutors,other attorneys and investigators that Bush wants for pursuingcriminal wrongdoing will be able to recover even the $50 millionthat the effort will cost annually.   Developers who dealt with many of the failed thrift institutions,particularly in Texas, where federally insured deposits were used tobuy yachts, lavish parties and resort homes for Sandamp;L owners, agreed.   David Gleeson, president of Lincoln Asset Management Co. inDallas, the nation's largest apartment developer and also a majordeveloper of shopping centers and office buildings, told thecommittee he suspects a lot of the money has been ``squirreled awayin foreign countries.''   ``Even if you could obtain a conviction and prove that funds wereillegally obtained and used for building a $6 million house in NorthDallas, that doesn't go very far in trying to recover $75 billion to$85 billion,'' Gleeson told the Senate panel.   Thornburgh said the Justice Department would use the $50 millionto set up several multi-agency task forces similar to a 57-memberteam that has been operating in the Dallas area for the past 18months.   So far, that Dallas task force has brought eight indictments and16 criminal informations against 33 individuals. The investigationhas yielded 20 convictions, fines totaling $133,250 andcourt-ordered restitutions totaling nearly $2.8 million.   Of the 12 people who have been sentenced, however, only onereceived more than a one-year jail term and four were placed onprobation, Thornburgh said.   Bush made his promise to ``relentlessly pursue'' Sandamp;L fraud casesearlier this week when he unveiled his plan, which also calls forincreasing the maximum prison sentences in such cases to 20 years.   Thornburgh and other Justice Department officials acknowledgedthat current federal sentencing guidelines for white-collar crimeare too lenient to be an effective deterrent.   ``For a bank fraud violation resulting in a $25 million loss tothe victim financial institution, for example, the culprit couldreceive a mere 30 months' imprisonment, perhaps even less,'' saidEdward Dennis, an assistant attorney general in the JusticeDepartment's criminal division.</TEXT></DOC>
