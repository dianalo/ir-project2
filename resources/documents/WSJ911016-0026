The new position, announced by the White House, for thefirst time explicitly calls for U.S.-Soviet talks about&quot;limits on the scope and timing&quot; of such defenses, commonlyreferred to as the Strategic Defense Initiative.</LP><TEXT>   Both President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachevhad previously opened the door to talks on the issue. Butyesterday's announcement contained more specifics than eitherside had advanced before, and also predicted an eventualagreement paving the way for deployment of both land-basedand space-based defenses favored by the administration andmany lawmakers.   The U.S. is far ahead of the Soviets in developing suchdefenses, and there have been suggestions in both countriesof having the U.S. help the Soviets build their ownanti-missile system.   While clearly following up on Mr. Bush's recent nucleararms-control initiative, the move also seemed calculated todrum up congressional support for the administration's SDIbudget request.   The statement, for example, suggested that the U.S. won'tunilaterally abrogate the existing Anti-Ballistic MissileTreaty by deploying certain kinds of anti-missile weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
