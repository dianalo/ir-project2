The Greens' fundamentalist faction prevailed at the party's national convention in Duisburg. The shift points the Greens back toward their radical roots and away from cooperation with other parties.    Convention delegates elected eight fundamentalists to the party's 11-member national leadership committee, where the two factions previously were in balance. The outcome is a setback for the party's pragmatists, who worry that the shift will alienate moderate supporters and discredit the Greens as a legitimate political party. Political observers, too, say the shift could hurt the Greens' ability to help forge state and local policy.    In weakening their moderate faction, the Greens are likely to push harder their opposition to nuclear arms and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Their demands for an immediate end to nuclear energy, socialization of the steel sector and the cleaning up of West Germany's chemical industry also will likely be emphasized.    &quot;The radical left-wing and fundamentalist cadre (of the Greens) have clearly gotten their way,&quot; said Hans-Christian Maass, deputy spokesman of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Party. Mr. Maass said the swing within the party erases its identity as a solely environmental group. Its new aim, he said, will be militant opposition to law and order in pursuit of ecological and socialist goals.    The shift within the party, which holds 8.3% of the seats in the federal parliament, the Bundestag, makes future alliances with the larger Social Democratic Party less likely. The Social Democrats' coalition with the Greens in the state parliament of Hesse broke up after the Social Democrats' sharp losses in state elections last month. They face less-promising prospects in state elections without the potential for coalitions with the Greens.    The outcome of the Hesse elections fueled support for the radicals within the Greens, whose anti-establishment elements have been essential in organizing sometimes violent demonstrations against nuclear power.    The party's latest shift was steered largely by Jutta Ditfurth, a 35-year-old ecologist and a leader of the party's radical wing. Ms. Ditfurth's victory came over such moderate Greens members as Joschka Fischer, Hesse's former environment minister, and Otto Schily, an attorney and one of the Greens' first representatives in the Bundestag.    Ms. Ditfurth and her allies in the Greens' leadership have been leading proponents of a boycott of the government's plans for a national census later this month. After selecting their new leaders, the convention's roughly 600 delegates voted overwhelmingly in favor of a nationwide campaign to undermine the census. </TEXT></DOC>
