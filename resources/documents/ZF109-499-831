GoesslingCoordinator of Scientific Computing Mallinckrodt Medical Inc. St. Louis, Mo.andM;Unfortunately, categorizing project management packages by industry is beyondthe scope of the Prodcut Guide.andP;  However, DR has published other articlesthat might be helpful.andP;  One reviews PSDI's Qwiknet Professional package, &quot;Apath to better project management,&quot; Jan. 8, page 35.andP;  There is also aStrategies article, &quot;Structuring project plans to cash in on innovation,&quot;Dec. 11, 1989, page 35.andM;MORE ON MAGNETO-OPTICSandM;In the DR Strategies article, &quot;Optical disks save space, time, maintenancecosts,&quot; a couple of errors crept into the accompanying Tech View, &quot;Rewritableoptical technology improving, but hurdles remain.&quot;andP;  (See July 23, page 30.)andM;First, the article says, &quot;magneto-optic technology causes wear because thelaser melts the disk interior wherever data is recorded.&quot;andP;  As the termimplies, magneto-optics is optically assisted magnetic recording.andP;  Thecharacteristic of the substrate used to form the inner data layer is suchthat it must be heated to 150 degrees Celsius before the magnetic polarity ofthe domain can be changed, but data is still recorded magnetically.andP;  This inno way melts or alters the surface.andM;Second, the article says that &quot;dye [reversible dye polymer] isn't affected byoxidation.&quot;andP;  Neither is magneto-optic media.andP;  The data layer inmagneto-optics is metallic and therefore is unaffected by oxidation.andM;Unlike other optical recording technologies, magneto-optics has no air gapbetween the outer protective layer and the inner data layer, which preventsoxidation.andM;Another characteristic of the substrate used is that it is self-passivating.andO;If a fracture of the outer protective layer occurs and oxidation begins, itis quickly halted.andP;  Media that are not self-passivating can become totallycorrupted in the event of contamination by oxidation.andM;Third, the article states that &quot;the low-powered laser that erasable opticaldisk drives currently use to write and rewrite data inhibits the speed atwhich the disks can rotate because of the lengthy time required to heat andalter the optical media.&quot;andP;  Although current magneto-optic products offerrotational speeds between 1800 rpm and 2400 rpm, this is an artificiallimitation and is in no way affected by the laser.andM;Tests performed by 3M indicate that the platters used in today's media canspin at 6000 rpm without failure.andP;  This speed will certainly increasethroughput and can be implemented without violating ISO standards.andP;  Robert H.andO;Wilson Vice President, Marketing and Sales Alphatronix Research TrianglePark, N.C.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
