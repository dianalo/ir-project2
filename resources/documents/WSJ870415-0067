The report, released yesterday by the Congress's auditing arm, comes as lawmakers consider whether to allow banks to engage in expanded securities, insurance and real estate activities.    Opponents of new powers recall the collapse of the nation's banking system during the Depression, a time when commercial bankers dominated the securities industry. That led to legislation separating commercial and investment banking and establishing federal deposit insurance.    Proponents of expanding bank services say it could be done without any threat to banks' safety and soundness. But the GAO concluded that neither of the methods now widely used &quot;guarantees complete protection to insulate the bank from risk.&quot;    For its study, the GAO examined 19 banks and bank holding companies in the Northeast, Midwest and West that conduct such activities as selling insurance or operating a discount brokerage house through either a department of the bank or a subsidiary.    The GAO didn't examine bank service corporations, a less frequently used structure. A bank service corporation is a separate company owned by two or more banks or bank holding companies.    The GAO concluded that placing the activities in subsidiaries provides better protection than putting them in departments of a bank since the subsidiaries are separate legal entities. But because these subsidiaries often use the same name and offices as their affiliated bank, they may be seen as a single operation, the report said. As a result, it noted, &quot;even if the bank and the affiliate are legally . . . separate this perception could lead to a run on the bank if the affiliate has trouble.&quot;    Placing the activities in bank departments offers less insulation, the report said, because the banks are legally liable for their operations.    The GAO noted, though, that the effectiveness of any organizational structure depends on the activity being conducted and how it is managed.    Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman William Seidman said he generally agreed with the report and its findings, but Judith Walter, senior deputy comptroller of the currency, called the study's conclusions &quot;unsupported and biased.&quot; Officials of the Federal Reserve Board hadn't any comment. </TEXT></DOC>
