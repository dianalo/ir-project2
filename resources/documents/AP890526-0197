A fear is that the elimination of trade barriers within the12-nation European Economic Community will trigger an invasion ofwealthy land speculators and jobless immigrants that could threatenthe islands' Caribbean identity.   On May 1, Labor Day, hundreds of trade unionists poured into thestreets of Fort-de-France, Martinique's capital, to voice theirconcern over the ``dangers of European integration,'' as oneofficial put it.   Protesters maintained that removing tariffs on European goodscoming into Martinique will stifle local production and theunrestricted circulation of capital will make it easier forEuropeans to buy land and businesses on the island.   Emmanuel Ibene, co-leader of the Guadeloupean Communist Party,said, ``A new status is being imposed on us, and nobody has askedour opinion.''   Guadeloupe and Martinique, about 150 miles apart halfway downthe arc of the Lesser Antilles, are French overseas departments.They are as much a part of France as Hawaii is of the United States.   Bakeries, Parisian accents, compact Citroen cars, cyclistswearing flashy racing tights training on picturesque rural roadsall resemble France.   Many ``metropolitans,'' as the European French are called, ownsmall shops and restaurants on the two islands. European drifterspeddle jewelry on street corners or sing and play guitars atsidewalk cafes.   With 500,000 resettled French West Indians, France itself isinfluenced by Caribbean culture. Every islander has relatives orfriends in France, and their music, ``zouk,'' similar to calypso,has millions of fans.   Being French, the islands are part of the European EconomicCommunity. Air travelers arriving here line up under customs signsthat read in French ``non-EEC citizens'' and ``EEC citizens.'' Thelatter need no passports.   A single European market with no travel, employment or residencyrestrictions would open the floodgates to immigration, opponentssay.   ``There are 23 million unemployed in Europe; it only takes halfa million to immigrate here and we're finished,'' said ClaudeMakouke, leader of the small separatist Popular Union for theLiberation of Guadeloupe.   ``The danger for Guadeloupe of remaining French is our culturaldisappearance through intermixing with Europeans,'' Makouke said.``For us, 1992 is the `coup de grace.'''   Most of the 680,000 residents of Martinique and Guadeloupe areof African descent, with a sprinkling of East Indians and Europeans.   Not everybody is opposed to a single European market. Theregional assemblies of both islands favor the idea.   ``Every Martiniquan should plant a banana tree for Europe,because the market is there,'' said Pierre Petit, leader of theisland's rightists and mayor of the mountain town of Morne Rouge.``Europe is what we need to lift us out of our torpor.''   French West Indians enjoy a high standard of living, receivingfree health care and generous unemployment benefits. But 25 percentof the work force is unemployed and 30 percent have governmentjobs. The French state is the main source of income, followed bybanana exports and tourism.   ``People think that in 1992 we're going to see fleets of 747sflying in here packed with wealthy West Germans coming to buy upall the business,'' said Pierre-Luc St. Yves, a Credit MartiniquaisBank manager. ``We're already part of the EEC. The Germans couldhave come long ago.''   Yet, many islanders are alarmed at the quantity of farm landbought by European investors to build villas and hotels. They alsofear the abolition in 1992 of a special tax on goods imported fromFrance. Towns here draw 50 percent of their revenues from the tax.   Even EEC advocates like Petit and St. Yves argue that measuresmust be taken to preserve the tax and protect real estate fromEuropean speculators.   Support for integration with France dates to the FrenchRevolution of 1789. Newly freed slaves saw alliance with therevolutionary government in Paris as a weapon against the localelite.   Residents of Martinique, Guadeloupe and French Guiana, France'sother overseas department, on the northern shoulder of SouthAmerica, vote in French elections and elect deputies and senatorsto the National Assembly in Paris.   Since Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist, was elected president ofFrance in 1981 and turned over powers to local assemblies, theFrench Caribbean islands have been run by their regional councils.They control their own budgets, development projects, culturalprograms and tourism.   Decentralization undercut support for independence, stillunpopular despite anxiety over the EEC of 1992.   ``Our demand to have our cultural identity recognized has oftenbeen misinterpreted as a desire for independence,'' said CamilleDarsiere, president of Martinique's Regional Assembly.   While independence is a non-issue in Martinique, a small butvocal separatist movement simmers in Guadeloupe, where a rash ofbombings in the early 1980s killed eight people and ended with the1984 arrest of separatist militant Luc Reinette.   ``Independence is losing ground. The word is used just to beheard,'' said Lucette Michaux-Chevry, deputy in the French NationalAssembly and leader of Guadeloupe's rightists. ``We are a successstory. Whether you like it or not, the French experiment workedhere.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Thurs PMs June 1</NOTE></DOC>
