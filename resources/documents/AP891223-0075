The attack came just hours after another leftist guerrillagroup, the April 19 Movement, announced it had suspended atentative peace pact after Congress failed to approved key parts ofthe accord.   Guerrillas belonging to the Revolutionary Armed Forces ofColombia blew up part of the road south of the town of San Martinas an army patrol traveling in three vehicles passed over it, thecommunique said.   The insurgents then opened fire on the patrol with automaticweapons and rockets, killing 10 soldiers and injuring anundetermined number, said the communique, read in a radio broadcastby the Caracol network.   The communique added that forces from the army's 7th Brigadewere still fighting the guerrillas who perpetrated the attack. SanMartin is 65 miles south of Bogota in Meta state.   Founded about 30 years ago, the Revolutionary Armed Forces ofColombia, with its estimated 5,000 armed rebels, is the oldest andlargest of Colombia's six main guerrilla groups.   Another group, the April 19 Movment, said Saturday that it wouldnot lay down its weapons and accept a government amnesty this monthas originally planned.   The movement cited as the reason for its decision Congress'sfailure to approve key points of an official peace plan, which wereincluded in legislation to reform the country's constitution.   The Senate shelved the legislation Dec. 14, after the Houseattached a bill allowing a national vote on Colombia's extraditionof drug traffickers.   The Senate apparently accepted President Virgilio Barco'sargument that the extradition referendum would lead to increasedterrorist violence by traffickers trying to pressure the publicinto rejecting extradition.   The shelving of the reform legislation was viewed as a victoryfor the Barco administration's struggle against traffickers but ablow to its efforts to make peace with the April 19 Movement andother leftist groups.   The legislation would have created a special electoral systemallowing the movement to elect members to Congress with fewer votesthan normally required. The group had demanded the concession inreturn for its agreement to lay down its arms.   A joint communique issued Saturday by the April 19 Movement'sleaders and government negotiators said the agreement has beensuspended but not discarded. ``Its contents are still valid, andits negotiators have the responsibility to make it a reality,'' thecommunique said.   Both sides expressed ``the will to continue seeking dialogue andnegotiation.'' A new round of talks to save the pact is to begin inJanuary.</TEXT></DOC>
