<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-44-0508 </DOCNO><TEXT>Theoretical and experimental parameters of the optical absorption spectrumof LiNd/sub 4/PO/sub 12/ crystals in the range 185 to 3200 nm have beenstudied using an increased number of levels in the theoretical fit andby the aid of a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 9 computer controlled spectrophotometer.Experimental and calculated values of electronic energy levels and oscillatorstrengths (f) of transitions from /sup 4/I/sub 9/2/ for Nd/sup 3+/ arelisted and compared. Intensity parameters, Slater-Condon radial integrals,spin-orbit coupling constant, radiative transition probabilities, andbraching ratios for Nd/sup 3+/ in LiNdP/sub 4/O/sub 12/ are calculatedand discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
