Bush, facing a deadline in three weeks, is also stepping up hissearch for a running mate, asking candidates if they're interestedin being considered and planning to use polling to determine thepopularity of different people.   The convention opens in New Orleans on Aug. 15, and Bush isn'tscheduled to arrive that week until Aug. 17, the next-to-last dayof the gathering. However, deputy press secretary Alixe Glen saidtoday, he will make a one-day trip to the convention city on Aug. 8for the platform meeting.   Bush's list of possible running mates was expanded Tuesday whenGov. John Sununu of New Hampshire said he had receivedquestionnaire forms that Bush is using in his search. Bush alreadyhad said that Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas would beamong those considered.   A Bush campaign official said the staff was contacting variouspeople to see if they wanted to be considered.   ``Preliminary interest is being ascertained. I think you're safeto assume it's more than John Sununu,'' the official said,insisting on anonymity and refusing to identify who else was beingcontacted.   Within Republican circles, other people considered as likelycandidates include Rep. Jack Kemp of New York and California Gov.George Deukmejian, even though he has said he is not interested inthe job.   Washington lawyer Robert M. Kimmitt has been asked to beginbackground checks on several potential vice presidential picks, TheWashington Post reported in today's editions.   Bush told the newspaper that Kimmitt will report directly to himrather than the campaign staff, to better maintain confidentialityin the information provided by the prospective running mates.   Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., co-chairwoman of Bush's campaigncommittee, said it's clear that some women are being considered.   ``One of the nicest surprises for me is hearing ... manyconservative members of my party talking about a woman on theticket as a good idea,'' said the congresswoman, whose name hasappeared on some public lists of possible running mates.   She said other strong candidates include former TransportationSecretary Elizabeth Dole, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, formerU.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr.   However, Rep. Martin said the selection of a woman was``possible, not probable.''   Bush, certain to be the Republican presidential nominee, hassaid he wants to keep his running mate a secret until theRepublican National Convention, which opens Aug. 15 in New Orleans.   Sheila Tate, Bush's campaign spokeswoman, said the vicepresident ``has expressed an interest in selective polling beingdone as one aspect of the process'' for winnowing names.   ``The polling has not started,'' she added.   Despite the public speculation about his running mate, Bushtrained his public focus on another subject Tuesday, delivering aspeech at the Library of Congress before congressional internsabout the ethical standards he would set if elected president.   He said Congress should be covered by the sameconflict-of-interest laws that govern federal officials and thatcivil penalities as well as criminal sanctions should be used topunish violators.   Bush said that under the current system, an official is chargedeither with a felony or nothing at all. ``This is plainlyunacceptable,'' the vice president said.   Breaking with the Reagan administration, Bush also endorsed theuse of independent counsels to investigate wrongdoing by federalofficials, and said Congress should come under the same law.   ``To exempt Congress from any of these rules, as does currentconflict-of-interest law, is to establish a double standard thatbreeds suspicion, breeds cynicism and, in my judgment, breedsabuse,'' he said. ``No one, no institution, no body of governmentshould be above the law.''   In Boston, Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakiscriticized Bush for taking a ``do-nothing'' approach to AttorneyGeneral Edwin Meese's legal difficulties. In his speech, Bush saidhe wasn't going to comment on matters surrounding Meese, as well asHouse Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, the subject of an ethicsinvestigation.   Bush said the current system of federal ethics law is ``aconfused quiltwork of executive policy statements, administrativeregulations, criminal law. ... In my administration, the code ofconduct will be clear and uniform.   ``It will reflect common sense,'' the vice president said.``Nothing will be overly technical. What is intuitively right _what your conscience tells you _ will invariably be the writtenrule.''   Bush said that ``the threshold for judging ethic conduct ingovernment is not, and should not and will not be whether anappointee has committed a criminal offense, but whether thatindividual has exercised honest, unbiased judgment and scrupulouslyavoided any appearance of impropriety ... of conflict of interest.''   Bush said he would create a White House ethics office headed bya senior counselor to the president whose first responsibilitywould be ethics. He said the office would complement the workalready done by the Office of Government Ethics, an executivebranch agency.</TEXT></DOC>
