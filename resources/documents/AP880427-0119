Times on the trade bill:   The comprehensive trade bill approved by the House ofRepresentatives is an improvement over the overly protectivemeasure that existed just two months ago. But that's not sayingmuch. ...   The trade bill, as now written, includes several provisions thatcould allow the United States to take retaliatory action withquotas and tariffs against other nations.   Funny. Usually when these goods enter the United States,Americans buy them because they are built well or because they areless costly than U.S.-made goods. ...   If the Senate doesn't water down this measure, Reagan shouldveto it.</TEXT><TEXT>   April 20   The World, Coos Bay, Ore., on the Persian Gulf conflict:   Is it right for us to be involved in the Persian Gulf?Certainly; the United States made its interests in open shippingthere very clear a long time ago.   Did we take the right ``measured response''? We believe so,since the attack was limited in scale, and aimed at militarytargets.   Will this all end Iran's temptation to be a festering sore inthe region? Given the recent history of that nation, and itsapparent need to treat the United States as ``the Great Satan,'' weguess it will not.</TEXT><TEXT>   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer on compensating imprisonedJapanese-Americans:   Only one step remains _ President Reagan's signature _ beforethe nation can offer its official apology to the 120,000Japanese-Americans who were unjustly imprisoned in relocation campsduring World War II.   The compensation legislation would give each of the 60,000 campsurvivors $20,000. While varying payments on the basis ofindividual losses incurred might be more equitable, it isimpractical almost 50 years after the fact.   Money, of course, cannot compensate these Americans and theirfamilies for the loss of their homes, jobs and businesses.   Nor can it make up for the shame and sorrow they suffered at thehands of a government which did not see the error in violating theConstitution at the same time it was fighting a war to defend it....   The nation cannot repay the 77,000 American citizens of Japaneseancestry and the 43,000 legal and illegal aliens for depriving themof their rights, but conscience demands that it make thislong-overdue gesture of heartfelt regret.</TEXT><TEXT>   April 21   North Jersey Advance, Flanders, N.J., on Larry Speakes andpresidential quotes:   Whether or not (former White House spokesman Larry) Speakescommitted some cardinal sin ... by attributing quotes to(President) Reagan that (he) did not utter is debatable.   But it is a fact that Reagan either tolerated his doing so, didnot know about it or, alas, does not remember again.   Reagan sidestepped the question: ... ``Did you approve of theprocess, and would you continue to allow that to happen in yourWhite House?''   Reagan responded that he ``just learned it recently, as all therest of you did.''   He went on to speak of his lack of ``affection for the kiss andtell books.'' ...   In seeking to deflect the question, the president all butadmitted that he had condoned what Speakes did. It was the telling,not the kissing, that he found objectionable.</TEXT><TEXT>   April 24   The Rapid City (S.D.) Journal on the Conservation ReserveProgram:   The recent drought has made blowing topsoil more visible inSouth Dakota, but it's nothing new.   Easily erodible soil is best left undisturbed. Depleting soildestroys a resource that we depend upon for life itself.   That's why the success of the federal Conservation Reserve, aprogram that pays farmers to return easily eroded croplands toundisturbed tree and grassland sanctuaries for wildlife, isencouraging. This is part of the federal farm program that makes agreat deal of sense. ...   Considering the values promoted by the Conservation Reserve andalternatives, it is a remarkably worthwhile federal initiative.   The Conservation Reserve Program does cost some money.   So did the Dust Bowl.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
