Meanwhile, Tass reported from Moscow that the rebels killed fourpeople, including two children, in a rocket attack on the Kabul,the Afghan capital. The official Soviet news agency said the``barbaric'' attack wounded 12.   Rebels have been increasing their rocket attacks on Kabul sinceSoviet troops began withdrawing from Afghanistan on May 15.   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said theguerrillas captured the city of Bamyan, about 70 miles northwest ofKabul, in mid-August.   Official Radio Kabul said government forces had to ``change thestatus of their deployment'' in central Bamyan province afterseveral days of fighting with the rebels. It did not elaborate.   Taloqan, the capital of northern Takhar province, has been inguerrilla hands since Aug. 15, when the Soviets said they reachedthe halfway point of their troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, thesources said.   They said guerrillas overran the city of Kunduz in neighboringKunduz province about the middle of August, but government forces,with heavy Soviet air support, wrested it back several days later.   Since then, the rebels have again laid siege to Kunduz and thesoutheastern provincial capital of Kandahar but have not capturedthem, the sources said.   Rebel commanders say their strategy is to take the provincialcapitals, then to stage an assault on Kabul, the fortress-likecapital that is expected to be the last stronghold of the departingSoviet army.   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to help thecommunist government fight the U.S.-backed guerrillas. On April 14,the Soviet Union agreeed to withdraw its estimated 100,000 troopsbeginning May 15, 1988 and ending Feb. 15, 1989.   At the Shindand air base in western Afghanistan, Soviet andAfghan troops recently clashed over the alleged rape of an Afghanwoman, according to Agency Afghan Press, a Pakistan-basedpro-guerrilla news service.   In another incident, two Soviets, three Afghans and an Indianlanded two Soviet helicopter gunships inside the Pakistani borderWednesday and asked for asylum, according to the semi-officialPakistani News Agency. Pakistani authorities Friday denied thereport.   Guerrilla leaders mourned the loss of their Pakistani supporter,President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, who died in a plane crash Aug. 17that also killed U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel and 28 others.   The guerrillas and some Pakistani officials have blamed thecrash on sabotage by agents of the Kabul government.   ``The late Zia is a victim of the Afghan holy war, who possessesa lofty place in the caravan of Afghan martyrs,'' said guerrillaleader Gulbaddin Hekmatyar in a statement Saturday.   Zia, an army general, championed the guerrillas' cause andoffered Pakistani territory for their training and supplies. Thenew government, under acting President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, haspledged to continue Zia's policy.</TEXT></DOC>
