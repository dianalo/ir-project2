Thedoses added were calculated as a function of cadmium covering a rangebetween 0--6 mg of Cd per kilogram of soil in dry weight. A loss of productionhas been observed when the dosage of Cd was 2 ppM. Also there was a notableincrease of metal concentration in aerial parts of the plant. This wasmainly because of Cd, Zn, Cu has above the normal values and presenteda strong correlation (P andless; 0.001) between the total soil and plant concentration.</TEXT></DOC>
