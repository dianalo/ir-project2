However, it is essential for the nuclear powergeneration continuously to retain economic superiority through concurentlymaintaining its high safety features and outstanding reliability. Forachieving this purpose, taking into account of importance explained above,we have been developing and improving those of technologies such as design,engineering, and construction regarding the both field of managementand techniques useful for plant construction.
