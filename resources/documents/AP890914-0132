(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge has agreed to decide whether thehourly tolling of the bell in the town clock in this little farmingcommunity is a melodious New England tradition or a noisy nuisance.   Richard and Pamela Carnall, who moved next door to thecentury-old clock last year, sued the town claiming the bell keepsthem awake at night.   They failed in an effort to get selectmen to silence the clockfrom 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. And the couple lost their bid for apreliminary injunction silencing the clock in April, but JudgeGeorge C. Keady Jr. said he will hear arguments on the nuisanceissue Oct. 5 in Hampshire Superior Court.   Both sides have already made their case loud and clear in courtand on Main Street in this 319-year-old community of 3,200 people.   The Carnalls contend they have been unable to adjust to thebonging of the 1,800-pound bell on the First Congregational Church,50 feet from their home.   Carnall maintained he puts off going to bed until after midnight_ when the bell tolls 12 times _ and said in a deposition that thelack of sleep has made him ``more impatient, more argumentative andless tolerant of others.''   Dr. Donald B. Rogers of Northampton said he has prescribedsleeping pills for Mrs. Carnall and maintained in a letter to thejudge that the bell is affecting her ``work and well-being.''   But Hatfield Town Counsel William O'Neil contended that the soundof the bell is simply part of life in a New England village and theCarnalls, both born and raised in the area, should have noticed thebell tower and considered that before buying their house.   When the Carnalls bought their house in August 1988, the bell andclock weren't working and they maintain they were unaware the bellwould resume tolling five months later.   Selectmen contend the only previous complaints they have receivedis when the bell hasn't sounded, and more than 200 townsfolk signedpetitions in support of the clock.   Selectman George B. Zagrodnik, who grew up with the tolling andstill lives in the family home across the street from the church,said some of his constituents have tartly pointed out that if thetown was to bow to the Carnalls, they ``just might decide that it'sa nuisance to have the town landfill by their place.''</TEXT></DOC>
