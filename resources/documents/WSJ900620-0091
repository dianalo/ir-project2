John Malone, president of Tele-Communications, made theproposal in a two-page letter to NBC President Robert C.Wright. Mr. Wright couldn't be reached for comment, and NBCofficials said they haven't seen the letter, but theyindicated that the General Electric Co. unit wouldn't bereceptive to cable concern's overture.</LP><TEXT>   The proposal is also likely to infuriate the more than 200broadcast TV stations that make up NBC's affiliate network.&quot;I can see no circumstance where such an arrangement would beattractive or acceptable to any NBC affiliate,&quot; said theaffiliate board chairman, Eric Bremner, who headsbroadcasting operations at KING Broadcasting Co.   The proposal is a fairly radical one in an industry wherecable systems have never had any relationship with the threenetworks other than to provide reception for the localbroadcast affiliate. A cable system has never served as thedirect carrier of network TV programs.   The timing of the proposal isn't accidental, saidTele-Communications Vice-President Robert Thomson. NBC islobbying Capitol Hill to pass federal legislation that wouldprohibit cable companies from signing exclusive agreementswith cable networks.   Currently, a cable network signs a contract that givescable systems the right to broadcast the network in assignedareas. For example, two cable companies in the Seattle regionhave the right to broadcast TNT, the all-movie cable channelowned by Turner Broadcasting System Inc.   NBC, which plans to operate a direct-to-home satellite TVbusiness dubbed Sky Cable with three partners by the end of1993, wants the right to carry cable channels on its newsystem, including those with existing exclusive distributionagreements.   Tele-Communications stressed, however, that it isn'tlooking to compete with NBC affiliates. In his letter, Mr.Malone asked for permission &quot;to receive for retransmission onits cable systems a direct network feed of all NBC networkprogramming in all its cable systems that do not have anexisting local network affiliate.&quot;   For example, Tele-Communications operates a cable systemin Carson City, Nev., which has no local NBC affiliate.TeleCommunications retransmits a distant signal from the RenoNBC affiliate, which provides no local programming or newsabout Carson City. But even if Tele-Communications became theCarson City affiliate, it would continue to carry the RenoNBC station, according to Tele-Communications' Mr. Thomson.   Mr. Thomson said in a telephone interview that there are&quot;hundreds&quot; of such cities that do not have local programming.And in his letter to NBC's Mr. Wright, Mr. Malone said, &quot;Ibelieve that TCI and NBC can work together to . . . providehometown television programming for a number of ruralcommunities across the United States which do not have itnow.&quot;   Tele-Communications' Mr. Thomson said his companyapproached NBC because &quot;it is the most effective and mostpopular programmer in the world, and they have indicated theyare cable-friendly.&quot; Of the three major broadcast networks,NBC has been the most aggressive in pursuing cableopportunities. Two years ago, it formed a programming jointventure with Cablevision Systems Corp. to produce a widevariety of entertainmnent, news and sports programming forcable systems.   Among the program ventures with Cablevision is theConsumer News and Business Channel, or CNBC, which isreceived by 16 million cable subscribers. NBC and Cablevisionalso formed a joint venture earlier this year with News Corp.and Hughes Communications, a unit of General Motors Corp., tolaunch the direct-to-home satellite TV service, Sky Cable.   But a move such as that proposed by Tele-Communicationscould put NBC at loggerheads with its affiliates. Even ifTele-Communications promises to continue to carry affiliatesthat are currently imported from distant cities, affiliatesworry that the cable company will eventually drop that NBCaffiliate. In recent years, cable companies have been allowedby law to drop any station that duplicates programmingprovided by another, such as a distant-city affiliate of anetwork.   In his letter, Mr. Malone addressed that concern, sayingthat &quot;NBC network programming might conceivably appear onmore than one cable channel.&quot; He also said that his company&quot;would relinquish its `affiliate status,' following propernotice and subject to certain conditions, in any communitywhere a new or existing broadcaster within the community wasselected as an NBC broadcast affiliate.&quot;   Moreover, he said that while his company would carry NBCon the same terms and conditions as those of NBC's broadcastaffiliates, Tele-Communications wouldn't ask NBC foraffiliate payments.   But Mr. Malone added that any agreement with NBC wouldhave to be &quot;phased in over time as NBC's existing, regionallyexclusive affiliation agreements lapse.&quot; Such agreements mustbe renewed every two to three years, and affiliates worrythat NBC might not renew such pacts if a cable system becomesan affiliate -- particularly if the cable system doesn'tcharge the network for carrying it.   NBC stressed it won't make any moves that might harmaffiliates. &quot;We would not do anything that was notadvantageous to our affiliates,&quot; said an NBC spokesman.   In his letter to Mr. Wright, Mr. Malone noted that manyrural cities and towns don't receive any local news, becausethey are reliant on stations imported from other cities,&quot;which are naturally inclined to give events happening intheir city of license overwhelming priority.&quot; Suchcommunities &quot;would be better served if they had their ownlocal NBC broadcast affiliates, but the economic reality isthat smaller communities often cannot support a broadcasttelevision station, let alone a full service broadcastnetwork affiliate.&quot;   For cable, Mr. Malone noted, &quot;the economics aredifferent.&quot; Cable systems get revenue from both advertisersand subscriber fees, and &quot;we have a growing ad sales capacityeven in our smallest service areas,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
