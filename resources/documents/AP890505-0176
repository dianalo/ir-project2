The boy's death raises to 461 the number of Palestinians killedin the 17-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation of the WestBank and Gaza Strip. Twenty Israelis also have been slain.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told Jews who survived an Arabknife attack that Israelis should make sure terrorists who assaultcivilians do not escape unharmed. An opposition legislator accusedhim of encouraging vigilantism.   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens rejected the French governmentreport on Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat'smeetings this week in Paris. Israel says the PLO is a terroristgroup and refuses to deal with it.   An army spokesman said the boy was shot when he joined maskedyouths who were throwing stones and iron bars at an armyobservation post in Bethlehem, and arrived dead at an Arab hospital.   He identified the victim as Mohammed Anton Shahin and said thefamily took the body before army investigators could establish theexact cause of death. The spokesman, who would not let his name beused, said Shahin was arrested and freed on bail two weeks ago fortaking part in a demonstration.   Arab reporters identified the boy as Milad Anton Shahin and saidhe was building a roadblock when he was killed by a bullet to thechest. Doctors at Mokassed Hospital in Jerusalem said he was takenthere and was pronounced dead on arrival.   Shahin's family took the body and tried to hold a funeralservice in Manger Square, across from the Church of the Nativity,but Israeli soldiers and police blocked the procession, the Arabreporters said.   They said the boy was buried in neighboring Beit Sahour villageand the funeral procession grew into a nationalist demonstration ofmore than 500 marchers. Dozens of masked youths waved Palestinianflags and shouted: ``With our blood and souls we shall redeem ourmartyr!''   Israel radio and Arab hospital sources said nine Palestinianswere wounded in clashes with soldiers Friday.   In Lebanon, three wounded Israeli soldiers were evacuated byhelicopter to a hospital in northern Israel. One has moderateinjuries and two are lightly wounded, an army spokesman said oncondition of anonymity.   He said the attack occurred on the edge of Israel'sself-proclaimed security zone, near the village of Aramta, 12 milesnorth of Israel's border with Lebanon.   A U.N. spokesman said Israeli artillery opened fire on militiapositions close to where the attack took place.   The army refused to confirm the incident, but Israel radioreported soldiers fired dozens of rounds.   On Thursday, two members of the Israeli-backed South LebanonArmy militia were killed by the detonation of a similar bomb nearKhiam village, four miles north of the Israeli border.   Foreign reports say about 1,000 Israeli troops patrol thesix-to-10-mile-wide buffer strip that Israel carved out when itwithdrew the bulk of its forces from Lebanon in 1982. Israelipatrols are assisted by the South Lebanon Army, a mostly Christianforce that Israel arms.   Shamir on Friday visited two victims of a Wednesday stabbingattack in which two elderly Jews were killed.   ``I think the general public and the Jewish public must do theirutmost in order to defend themselves and in order to preventmurderers from doing their deeds, and in order to prevent them fromcoming out unscathed if they succeed in doing something,'' Shamirsaid in remarks broadcast on radio stations.   Legislator Haim Oron of the Socialist Mapam Party was quoted byIsrael radio as criticizing Shamir for calling on people to takethe law into their own hands.   Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner said the comments were meant toencourage cooperation with the police, not vigilante attacks.   After Wednesday's attack, an Israeli crowd chased, caught andbeat the attacker, who was rescued by police.   The assailant, Nidal Abdel Razak Zaloum of the West Bank town ofel-Bireh, appeared before a judge Friday and was ordered detainedfor another two weeks.   In Washington, the State Department said if the attack wascarried out by the Islamic Jihad in Palestine, as the groupclaimed, then it was an act of terrorism.   But Margaret Tutwiler, the department spokeswoman, also said``the motivation for this brutal attack is unclear at this time.''She said everyone ``interested in peace should condemn this act...an outrageous act.''   Ms. Tutwiler said the group was based primarily in Gaza and wasnot part of the Palestine Liberation Organization.</TEXT></DOC>
