The plan, more than four years in the making, calls for Manville to set up a trust to pay present and future asbestos victims an estimated $2.5 billion over the next three decades. Manville will also set up a $125 million trust to pay asbestos-related property damage claims, asking Denver-based Manville to pay for the cost of removing asbestos products from buildings.    Judge Lifland had indicated at the close of confirmation hearings Tuesday night that he would issue the ruling. In a 48-page opinion, he described Manville's reorganization effort as &quot;huge, complex, (and) unparalleled.&quot;    Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., Manville's financial advisers, had provided &quot;convincing evidence&quot; that the company's creditors would fare better under the reorganization plan than they would if the company were liquidated, the judge said.    The plan had been approved by all groups of creditors except for holders of common, whose stake in the company stands to be diluted as much as 98% under the plan. In confirming the plan over their objections, the judge said the plan didn't discriminate unfairly against holders of common.    Manville said the confirmation positions the company to emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings late next year, depending on appeals. Holders of common and a group of attorneys representing about 800 asbestos victims have indicated they will appeal the plan.    Manville, a Denver building and forest products concern, filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in August 1982, after being swamped with thousands of lawsuits claiming death or disease from asbestos. Asbestos is a mineral, once widely used in piping and insulation, that causes lung cancer and other respiratory diseases that often don't show up for years. </TEXT></DOC>
