(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co. on Tuesdayannounced the planned layoff of 450 workers this month, with aboutthe same number to follow next year.   President Bill Brown blamed the firings on a slowdown in attackhelicopter production.   He said temporary and regular employees would be laid off,including workers at plants in Mesa and Culver City, Calif., and inall divisions.   The helicopter division of McDonnell Douglas Corp. has 5,000employees at its Mesa plant and 3,000 in Culver City.   The company has been building about 10 AH-64 Apache attackhelicopters a month, but the Pentagon has ordered that rate cutback to six a month beginning June 1990.   McDonnell Douglas has delivered about 460 Apaches on a contractthat called for 975. But President Bush said two weeks ago inunveiling his defense cuts that the Army now wants only 807, a dropof 168.   The division also builds the MD-500 series of light helicoptersand a variety of automatic cannons.   The Apache suffered a major setback earlier this year when thecommander of the Army's 82nd Aviation Brigade at Fort Bragg, N.C.,complained that it was unreliable. He said all 12 of the Apaches inhis unit were incapacitated at points during a war exercise, andonly five were in operating condition at the end.</TEXT></DOC>
