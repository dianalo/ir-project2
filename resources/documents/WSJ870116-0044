GE said fourth-quarter earnings rose to $730 million, or $1.60 a share, from $638 million, or $1.40 a share, a year earlier. GE said between 12 cents and 14 cents a share in the fourth quarter came from RCA Corp., which the company bought last June. Sales for the quarter rose 41% to $12.27 billion from $8.73 billion. The 1986 quarter included $2.59 billion of sales from RCA, GE said.    Without RCA, GE's fourth-quarter sales would have risen 11%. The results, as well as recent comments made by GE Chairman John F. Welch, indicate that the Fairfield, Conn.-based maker of electrical equipment, with interests in broadcasting and financial services, will continue to achieve earnings growth primarily through acquisitions, analysts said.    GE shares, heavily traded yesterday, closed at $92.75, up $1.75 on volume of 1.7 million in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    For the year, GE earnings rose 9% to $2.49 billion, or $5.46 a share, from $2.28 billion, or $5 a share, in 1985. Sales, including $5.7 billion from RCA, rose 24% to $35.21 billion from $28.29 billion, the company said. Without RCA, sales would have risen 4%. GE said 1985 results were restated because of a change in accounting for oil and gas properties. The restatement lowered full-year earnings by 13 cents a share and fourth-quarter net by five cents a share, GE said.    GE said it ended the year with a strong financial position, with $2.3 billion in cash, marketable securities and funds held for business development. Short and long-term debt was about 29% of total capital at year's end, compared with 39% in June after the RCA merger.    GE didn't elaborate on sector results for the quarter, but for the year it said its consumer products earnings were substantially ahead on flat revenue, &quot;principally because of continuing improvements in cost performance in consumer electronics.&quot; Major appliances had &quot;an excellent earnings increase on higher sales,&quot; while industrial products earnings were &quot;down somewhat . . . on lower revenues from general weakness in all principal markets.&quot;    Power systems earnings and revenue were &quot;significantly lower,&quot; reflecting lower backlogs and &quot;a dearth of new orders&quot; for turbine, nuclear and power delivery businesses, GE said. Aircraft engines had an &quot;excellent earnings increase on much higher volume,&quot; it said.    Materials earnings were considerably ahead of the previous year on &quot;good volume increases in plastics,&quot; GE said. Technical products had &quot;much higher earnings&quot; and improved sales.    In its financial services businesses, GE said that Employers Reinsurance Corp. had substantially higher earnings on strong volume increases, and that Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., the investment and brokerage concern, &quot;had a positive impact on GE's earnings after acquisition costs.&quot; General Electric Credit Corp.'s earnings were about even with 1985.    GE said that at RCA, excluding acquisition costs, National Broadcasting Co. had &quot;an excellent increase in earnings on higher sales.&quot; It also said RCA's aerospace and defense businesses had &quot;good increases&quot; in sales and earnings. </TEXT></DOC>
