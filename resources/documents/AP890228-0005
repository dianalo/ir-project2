(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   About 35 people marched Monday in supportof the three animal rights activists who have spent the past weekatop a 160-foot crane to protest construction of a new universityanimal research facility.   University of California officials said they planned to seek jailterms and fines for the crane sitters if they continue to defyorders to come down, and estimated the protest was costing theschool $30,000 a day.   The three protesters offered Sunday to come down if theuniversity dropped all charges against them, but school officialsrefused.   ``If we cave in to this kind of behavior to people who behavelike terrorists, then we're subject to this kind of behavior atevery turn,'' said Assistant Chancellor John Cummins. ``We're goingto wait them out. They'll get tired and they'll come down.''   Jonnie Vermont, who climbed down from the crane Friday, toldsupporters, ``If they're (the university) going to pay hardball,we're going to play hardball.''   A protester identified only as Lee climbed the crane Sunday withthe use of a mountain-climbing harness, blowing kisses and eating anorange while dangling from a 20-foot rope.   The protesters originally numbered six when they climbed thecrane last Tuesday. Four climbed down, but one went back with abackpack of food and water Saturday. Since Saturday, campus policehave occupied the cab of the crane.   ``We have no illusions that we are going to halt construction ofthe facility for good,'' said Todd Paterson, who came down from thecrane after more than 84 hours. ``But we have been able to drawattention to the issue and to let people know how dangerous thiswould be.''   Animal rights activists contend the lab will be used to conductcruel and unnecessary experiments on animals, is located dangerouslyclose to an earthquake fault and could release toxic material intothe environment.   A counter-protest was held across the street from Monday'sdemonstration.   ``Animal researchers are as humane as anyone. And we make surethe animals are not mistreated and abused ... that's all their ownfantasies,'' university physiology professor Charles Nicoll of theCoalition for Animals and Animal Research said at thecounter-demonstration.   The university won a court ruling Friday that ordered a halt tothe protest. Attorneys plan to return to court Tuesday to seek30-day jail terms or $500 fines for protesters who resist.   University spokesman Ray Colvig said there were no plans to tryto storm the crane and forcibly remove demonstrators because of thepotential danger.   Howard Lichtig, a Castro Valley attorney representing thedemonstrators, said the university was being unreasonable.   ``The university has foreclosed negotiations,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
