The Israeli army demolished four houses and sealed seven othersin the occupied West Bank to punish Palestinians accused of attackson troops and on Arabs suspected of collaborating with Israel.   Arabs in Gaza met with Brown as he made his first trip to theterritory, home to more than 700,000 Palestinians, since he becameambassador in December.   ``We strongly suggested there has to be more serious interventionon the part of the United States to get people moving,'' said lawyerFayez Abu Rahme, who attended a luncheon meeting with Brown. Twophysicians also participated.   Rahme said the Palestinians were critical of Israeli PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir's peace initiative, which calls forelections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to selectPalestinians to negotiate an interim autonomy settlement for thelands.   The Bush administration has backed the initiative but expressedconcern that a lack of details, especially on the final status ofthe territories, will discourage Palestinian acceptance.   Rahme would not elaborate on specific Palestinian requests, butsaid participants told Brown ``there can be no elections without awithdrawal of Israel troops,'' or international supervision. Israelrejects both ideas.   U.S. Embassy officials described Brown's visit as ``anorientation trip'' but gave no details. Brown declined to talk withreporters.   At least 516 Palestinians and 22 Israelis have been killed sincethe uprising against Israeli occupation of the territories began inDecember 1987. Israel has controlled the territories since capturingthem from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.   Palestinian groups opposed to PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat'sattempts to negotiate with Israel issued a statement in Damascus,Syria, on Tuesday condemning Egypt for sending a top official toIsrael.   Butros Ghali, Egypt's minister of state for foreign affairs, wentto Jerusalem this week to offer Egypt's services as a mediatorbetween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization on theelection proposal.   ``We warn our people to be awake to foil the moves of Ghali andArafat,'' said the Palestine National Salvation Front.   An army spokesman said troops demolished the Palestinian homesand sealed the others following arrests of Arab attackers.   They included 49 Arabs in the West Bank town of Nablus accused ofbeing part of a squad with links to Arafat's Fatah wing of the PLO,said the spokesman, who cannot be identified under military rules.   One of the houses sealed was in the Askar refugee camp nearNablus. The army said cement blocks were thrown from the house inApril, slightly injuring several soldiers.   Ahmed Shtawi, 42, who owned the house said no one in his familywas detained in connection with the incident and they should not bepenalized for the acts of others.   The United States and international human rights organizationshave condemned house demolitions, saying they deny people dueprocess under the law since suspects rarely are tried before theirhouses are destroyed.   The Arab-run human rights group Al Haq-Law in the Service of Mansays the army has destroyed or sealed more than 330 houses in theWest Bank and 58 in the Gaza Strip since the start of the uprising.   Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev told Parliament police arrested twoPalestinian suspects in the murder of Oren Baharami, a 13-year-oldIsraeli who was sexually molested and killed in the Tel Aviv suburbof Jaffa two months ago.   He identified the suspects as a 26-year-old man from Gaza Cityand a 30-year-old resident of Rafah.   Hundreds of Arab prisoners in northern Israel rioted at Megiddomilitary jail for security offenders late Tuesday after soldiersfired tear gas at prisoners who refused to leave their tent to becounted, the army said.   The riot lasted less than an hour and three prisoners weretreated for tear gas inhalation, the army said. Israel radioreported 22 prisoners injured and 10 hospitalized, and said a cloudof tear gas floated 2 miles away.</TEXT></DOC>
