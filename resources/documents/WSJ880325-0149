The firm, a unit of Morgan Stanley Group Inc., also was barred for 30 days as a market maker or order-entry firm for the association's Small Order Execution System. Samuel Wegbreit, an equity trader in Morgan Stanley's index and equity program-trading department, was censured and fined $10,000. Mr. Wegbreit and the firm also were assessed a total of almost $1,800 to cover costs of a disciplinary proceeding.    A Morgan Stanley spokesman confirmed the actions but otherwise declined comment. Mr. Wegbreit didn't return phone calls.    The NASD, a Washington-based self-regulatory body for the over-the-counter market, said Mr. Wegbreit improperly used the Small Order Execution System, which is reserved for small orders from the public. Mr. Wegbreit used the system in 1986 for 193 transactions in Morgan's own account, the NASD said.    In addition, the association said Mr. Wegbreit on 18 occasions split orders for program-trading customers, and then executed the smaller trades on the small-order system. Such order splitting is prohibited, the association said. The small-order system was set up to handle trades of no more than 1,000 shares in national market system issues, and no more than 500 shares in other stocks.    On large orders, brokers ordinarily must negotiate prices with various market makers, whose prices might differ. The small-order system is designed to speedily obtain the best price for small-order customers.    The association said Morgan failed to &quot;establish, maintain and enforce written supervisory procedures&quot; and thus violated the industry's rules of fair practice. The association didn't disclose how much money, if any, Mr. Wegbreit's actions saved for Morgan or its program-trading customers. In program trading, sophisticated customers use computers to take advantage of tiny technical differences in market prices for stocks and other trading instruments. </TEXT></DOC>
