A numberof two phase systems are evaluated of their ability to remove and concentrateethanol and other alcohols from fermentation broths. After the preliminaryevaluation in model systems, the process is evaluated using a numberof fermentation broths to determine if organisms and/or media constituentsinterfere with the proces. The final phase of the project evaluates anumber of methods for recovery of the alcohols after removal from thebroths. Preliminary results to date show that butanol, iso-propanol,acetone and ethanol can be absorbed by charcoal (maximum loading 0.15g/g of charcoal). Work with a polyethylene glycol-dextran system wasdiscontinued since the concentration effect by this system was very low.Promising results were obtained using heptanol as a second phase to removebutanol. However, when heptanol was replaced by octanol problems wereencountered due to emulsion formation. Preliminary results on recoveryof butanol from charcoal using vacuum distillation resulted in a fractioncontaining 75% butanol and 25% water. 2 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
