The K/sub 2/SO/sub 4/ doped with europium ion showedan intensive TL, which was enhanced by firing in the oxygen atmosphere.The orientation in K/sub 2/SO/sub 4/ host crystal was observed by firingin the helium atmosphere. The degree of the orientation related closelyto the ESR signal intensity, but it was independent of the TL intensity.</TEXT></DOC>
