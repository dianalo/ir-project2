STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Members of Hungary's increasinglydivided Communist Party met Tuesday to discuss reforms that mayaffect top-level officials as pressure mounted for the party'sleader to resign.   The party's Central Committee cited ``personnel changes'' as oneof two items on the agenda of a May 20 session of the CommunistParty, according to a communique issued at the end of the one-daysession.   The meeting focused on a draft document on political andeconomic changes authored by party leader Janos Kadar, according tothe official news agency MTI.   Kadar, who turns 76 on May 26, has been blamed by partyloyalists and dissidents alike for Hungary's economic crisis andhis apparent reluctance to endorse sweeping political reform.   Premier Karoly Grosz, a leading contender for Kadar's position,has said the political future of the party boss may be up fordebate at a national party conference May 20-22.   Kadar has led the party since Moscow quashed an anti-Sovietuprising in 1956. He has said he would step down if asked, but hasgiven little indication he intends to relinquish control soon.   Tuesday's meeting was to elect a special committee that willdeal with personnel matters at the conference, Grosz told reporterswhile on a visit to Britain last week.   ``In the event that some 1,000 delegates attending theconference decide that personnel changes are necessary, and ifthese changes include the person of Janos Kadar, he will accept thedecision,'' Grosz said on Friday, according to MTI.   Last month, four outspoken advocates of political reform anddialogue with non-party activists were abruptly expelled from theCommunist ranks.   That move was seen as a sign that Kadar and his followers, whoare reportedly locked in a debate over who should retire first,still wield clout among the nation's 880,000 Communists.   However, pressure is growing for Kadar's resignation, withyounger party officials anxious to assume power and citizenscomplaining about government austerity measures.   With a foreign debt of more than $17 billion, this nation of10.6 million people has Eastern Europe's highest per capita debt.   Inflation is running at more than 15 percent, and is likely togo higher following a decision April 1 to liberalize state controlson 80 percent of Hungary's retail prices.   The draft paper for the May 20 conference goes far in dealingwith these complaints. In it, the Communist party formally acceptsblame for the current economic hardships and considers grantinglimited political reforms such as secret ballots and limited termsin party office.   But some critics of the paper have demanded that party membersstick rigidly to Communist policy in public statements.   The demand is seen as an attack on leading reformist ImrePozsgay, a member of the Central Committee and the Communistestablishment's foremost proponent of reform.   Pozsgay has said he found support in Moscow for his ideas andwants to see the government initiate referendums for change, aswell as guarantee independence in Hungarian for special interestgroups.   The arguments of reformists like Pozsgay have been bolstered inrecent months by the growing number of economists who areadvocating market reforms as the only way out of Hungary's growingeconomic crisis.</TEXT></DOC>
