Cerus posted a loss of 2.2 billion francs for all of 1990,primarily as a result of provisions it took after selling itsshares of Societe Generale de Belgique and of financial costslinked to its debt. The first-half loss reflected acarry-over on those costs.</LP><TEXT>   The company said its divestment plan, including the saleof a 14.9% stake in the fashion group Yves Saint Laurent,helped whittle down the company's debt to 567 million francson June 30 from 4.1 billion francs at the end of 1990.   However, Cerus, which is controlled by Italian investorCarlo De Benedetti, noted that the progressive nature of thedebt reduction left it with significant financial charges.The benefit of the reduced debt will be seen in the secondhalf when results are expected to improve substantially, thecompany said.   Traders said the loss was a bit larger than expected.   Cerus has a controlling stake in French auto parts companyValeo S.A., which posted a 46% decline in first-half profitas a result of a slowdown in the auto market.   Cerus also owns Banque Dumenil Leble, which was recentlytouched by scandal when its Swiss unit discovered that it hadbeen used unknowingly as a conduit for an Italianstock-trading fraud. News broke in August that 100 billionlire ($79.5 million) of Italian equities deposited at BanqueDumenil Leble Suisse S.A. were supposedly missing. It wasdisclosed that Dumenil Leble Suisse had transferred thestocks to Banca di Sempione on behalf of Dominion Trust ofTurin. Cerus said Italian market authorities indicatedWednesday before the Italian Assembly that certain Italianstockbrokers had acted in concert with Dominion Trust tocommit the fraud.   In a statement, the holding company said necessarymeasures have been taken in the wake of the incident tosafeguard the interests of the bank and the markets.   The Cerus executive board also voted yesterday to acceptthe nomination of Michel Cicurel, a food company executive,for the position of president. Mr. Cicurel succeeds JacquesLetertre, who resigned earlier this month in after theItalian fraud incident. Analysts said that was the last strawin an already-strained relationship between Mr. De Benedettiand Mr. Letertre.</TEXT></DOC>
