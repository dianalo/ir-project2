Educators should take a lesson from ``the failure of socializedeconomies in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union,'' Quayle said.   He called for wider efforts to give parents choice in publiceducation and vouchers to allow them to choose between public andprivate schools.   He had in mind vouchers paid for by state and local governments,not Washington.   Addressing a Hudson Institute forum at the National Press Club,the vice president said, ``The people of Eastern Europe arethrowing out these (government-controlled) systems, and the peopleof the Soviet Union, hopefully, are not far behind. It is now timeto apply this lesson to our own education system.''   ``Unfortunately, the education establishment has succeeded inputting our school system behind a `Berlin Wall' ... of rules andregulations that stifle ingenuity and limit competition,'' hecharged.   Parents are denied free choice in selecting their children'sschool, he said; schools lack the freedom to hire the most talentedstaff, and teachers cannot choose the best curriculum.   ``Our schools are robbed of the benefits of flexibility andcompetition ... that are enjoyed in virtually every other sector ofour society,'' he said.   The American economy ``flourishes because it operates in a freemarket. Our school system is declining because it is a centrallyplanned monopoly,'' said Quayle, who sends his three children toprivate schools. They attended Fairfax County, Va., public schoolswhen their father was a senator.   Quayle praised Minnesota's public school choice program and astate-backed experiment in Milwaukee giving up to 1,000 poorchildren a chance to choose any public school or a $2,500 vouchertoward tuition at a private school.   Quayle met earlier with Polly Williams, a Democratic staterepresentative from Milwaukee spearheading that effort to promotechoice.   He said he will campaign in Oregon next week for a initiative onthe November ballot giving Oregonians a similar choice amongschools.   ``Let's give the education establishment and the politicians alittle wake-up call,'' said Quayle.   Public schools now enroll more than 88 percent of the nation's46 million schoolchildren, private schools just under 12 percent,according to government figures.</TEXT></DOC>
