Lobbyists are waiting with blunt messages for legislators whoreturn to the Capitol this week from a month-long summer vacation.   ``Make no mistake about it,'' warned a letter sent to lawmakersby Paul Weyrich, chairman of a coalition of conservative groups.``If you vote to block the (Rep. Dana) Rohrabacher amendment, wewill alert our members that you are on record as supportingtax-sponsored pornography.''   Rohrabacher, a California Republican, wants the House to adoptSenate-passed restrictions that bar federal funding for art that isdeemed ``obscene or indecent'' or ``denigrates, debases or reviles''people's beliefs based on religion, sex, race, creed, handicap, ageor national origin.   ``The word we're putting out is not to let up at all,'' said DeanAmhaus, senior associate of the American Council for the Arts, anon-profit arts organization working to defeat the proposed limit.   The provision, sponsored by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., is part ofa $10.9 billion measure to finance the Interior Department andseveral other agencies during the upcoming fiscal year. The Senatepassed it on a voice vote on July 26.   Helms' wrath was triggered by $45,000 the National Endowment forthe Arts spent from its $170 million budget to support exhibits bytwo controversial photographers. One by Robert Mapplethorpe depictedhomosexual and sadomasochistic acts. Another by Andres Serranoshowed a crucifix in a container of urine.   The Senate provision imposes a five-year ban on funding two artgroups that sponsored grants to Mapplethorpe and Serrano.   The Helms provision is not in the House version of the bill, sothe Senate and House must find mutually agreeable language beforesending it to President Bush for his signature.   ``Free speech does not require us to spend tax dollars tosubsidize such photos,'' says a radio commercial for Helms' 1990re-election campaign aired across North Carolina two weeks ago. Thead said Mapplethorpe's works were guilty of ``sexually exploitingyoung children,'' and described him as an avant garde artist whodied recently of AIDS.   General Manager Bryan McIntyre of Raleigh, N.C., radio stationWPTF-AM, which ran the commercials, estimates that three-fourths ofthe telephone calls the station received about the ads supportedHelms.   Rohrabacher said that in his Long Beach, Calif.-centereddistrict, support for his position is 95 percent. Opponents aremerely a ``vocal minority,'' he said.   Rohrabacher faces an uphill fight in the House, whichoverwhelmingly rejected efforts to slash the arts endowment's budgetin retribution for the Mapplethorpe and Serrano exhibits. The Houseinstead voted to cut the endowment's coffers by $45,000, the amountspent on the two artists.   Opponents of Helms' proposal say they believe the public is ontheir side when they argue that the government should not censor artprojects.   ``The larger question of state control is much more onerous thanthe possibility that from time to time some piece of art offends,''says Anne Murphy, executive director of the American Arts Alliance,a non-profit advocacy group for the nation's art institutions.   Other budget issues facing Congress when it resumes workWednesday are:   _Final passage of all 13 annual spending bills for federalagencies for fiscal 1990.   _An effort by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., to extend aHouse-passed permanent ban on smoking on airline flights of twohours or less to longer routes. The measure is part of thetransportation spending bill.   _Completion of a bill providing $13 billion in savings through acombination of spending cuts and new tax receipts. It is stillunclear what taxes will be involved, but a cut in the capital gainsrate _ which supporters say would spark the economy and boostreceipts _ is possible. Passage would probably enable Congress toobey the Gramm-Rudman law's projected 1990 deficit target of $110billion.   _Extension of the government's authority to borrow money, whichexpires Oct. 15. The must-pass bill is expected to attract numerousbudget-process revision amendments.</TEXT></DOC>
