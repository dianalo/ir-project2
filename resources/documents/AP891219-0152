Baker III for directPalestinian-Israeli negotiations.   His two-day visit coincided with Prime Minister Mudar Badran'sannouncement that Jordan was lifting martial law imposed 22 yearsago after Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 war.   ``I will brief King Hussein on all that concerns our centralissue, the Palestinian issue ... and developments on thePalestinian, Arab and international arenas because we are in onetrench,'' Arafat told reporters.   ``Our relationship with Jordan is beyond the level ofcoordination. ... We are one family and it gives me pleasure tocome to Jordan at anytime.''   Badran and other Cabinet members met Arafat at the airport andall drove to the Guest Palace, where Hussein was expected to jointhem for talks.   Arafat adviser Bassam Abu Sharif told The Associated Press thetalks will focus on ``concentrated efforts to open aPalestinian-Israeli dialogue'' in Cairo and deal with ``Israelideviousness which tries to dampen and control all efforts for apeaceful political solution to the Palestinian problem.''   Baker proposed in October that the meetings between Palestinianand Israeli delegations focus on Israeli Prime Minister YitzhakShamir's election plan for the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   The election is part of a wider plan for a limited self-rule for1.7 million Palestinians living under occupation. The Palestinianshave been waging a bloody insurrection in the occupied lands sinceDec. 8, 1987.   The PLO says it must name the Palestinian delegation and theagenda must be open to all topics.   Israel regards the PLO as a terrorist organization and rejectsany direct or indirect PLO involvement.   Badran affirmed Jordan's support for the Palestinians saying:``We in Jordan are all Palestinians when it comes to thePalestinian issue.''   ``We support all the efforts of the PLO because they work forthe benefit of the Palestinian cause.''   In July 1988, Hussein renounced sovereignty over the West Bank,turning over reponsibility to the PLO.   More than half of Jordan's population of 3 million is ofPalestinian origin, and Badran is known for close ties with the PLO.   In Tunis, the Tunisian capital where the PLO is headquartered,the organization published a statement at the end of a three-dayleadership meeting which said, ``The United States' unlimitedsupport for the Israeli leadership is hampering the peace processin the Middle East region.''   But it said it was ready to open a dialogue with the Israelis onthe basis of principles laid down in Baghdad in October at the lastmeeting of the PLO Central Council _ the PLO's right to pickmembers of the Palestinian delegation and following the Cairo talkswith ``an international conference on peace in the Middle East withthe participation of Egypt and Sweden.''   The lifting of martial law was the latest in a series of movesby Prime Minister Badran and Hussein aimed at liberalizingJordanian society.   Badran also promised to crack down on corruption among publicofficials, and criticized former governments for deficit spendingthat swelled Jordan's $8.3 billion foreign debt.   The newly elected, 80-member legislature adjourned after hearingthe policy statement, and a vote of confidence was set for Dec. 30.   Badran's 23-member Cabinet, which he formed Dec. 6, needs 41votes to be installed. Otherwise, Hussein will have to appoint anew prime minister.   Most candidates in last month's general elections had called forthe lifting of martial law, under which authorities can closenewspapers at any time, effectively inhibiting free criticism ofofficials.   Martial law also banned large public meetings, provided forspecial courts and allowed authorities to interfere in privatebusiness dealings and control bank transactions.</TEXT></DOC>
