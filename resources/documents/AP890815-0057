A spokesman said Christopher E. Jackson, 33, may be consideredfor psychiatric evaluation.   The duck was the mate of a drake that spent time flying betweenLafayette Park opposite the White House and a nearby fountain.   Eyewitnesses told The Washington Times that Jackson identifiedhimself as ``Chris from New Hampshire,'' picked up the duck Mondayand crossed Pennsylvania Avenue to the northern gate of the WhiteHouse.   He then pulled a knife from his pocket and slit the fowl's throatbefore impaling its remains on the White House fence, according tothe Secret Service.   Four Secret Service agents then handcuffed Jackson and took himinto custody after disarming him.   The White House had no comment on the incident.   The FBI was called in to investigate because the bureau hasjurisdiction over migratory birds.</TEXT></DOC>
