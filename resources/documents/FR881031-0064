Bobeck, M.D.; Revocation of Registration </ITAG>On September 2, 1988, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of DiversionControl, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to ShowCause to Charles J. Bobeck, M.D., of 1729 Termino Avenue, Suite A, LongBeach, California, proposing to revoke his DEA Certificate of RegistrationAB1051894, and to deny any pending applications for renewal of such registrationas a practitioner under 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The statutory basis for the issuanceof the Order to Show Cause was that Dr. Bobeck is not currently authorizedto handle controlled substances in the state in which he maintains hisDEA Certificate of Registration. The Order to Show Cause was sent registered mail, return-receipt requested,to Dr. Bobeck's registered address. The returned receipt indicates thatthe Order to Show Cause was received on September 14, 1988. Dr. Bobeckhas not made any response. Therefore, pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), theAdministrator concludes that Dr. Bobeck has waived his opportunity fora hearing, and enters this final order based upon the information containedin the investigative file. 21 CFR 1301.57. The Administrator finds that on January 7, 1988, the California Board ofMedical Quality Assurance (BMQA) ordered the revocation of Dr. Bobeck'sphysician's and surgeon's license in that state, effective January 22,1988. As of that date, Dr. Bobeck was no longer authorized to handle controlledsubstances in the State of California. The Drug Enforcement Administration does not have statutory authority underthe Controlled Substances Act to maintain the registration of an individualwho lacks state authority to handle controlled substances. See 21 U.S.C.823(f); and <T3>Emerson Emory, M.D.,</T3> Docket No. 85-46, 51 FR 9543 (1986); <T3>Avner Kauffman, M.D.,</T3> Docket No. 85-8, 50 FR 34208 (1985); and<T3>Agostino Carlucci, M.D.,</T3> Docket No. 82-20, 49 FR 33148 (1984).Since Dr. Bobeck is no longer authorized to handle controlled substancesin the State of California, the DEA Certificate of Registration previouslyissued to him in that state must be revoked pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3).Accordingly, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration,pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824, and 28CFR 0.100(b), orders that DEA Certificate of Registration AB1051894, previouslyissued to Charles J. Bobeck, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked. It is further ordered that any pending applications for renewal of saidregistration be, and they hereby are, denied. <ITAG tagnum="21">This order is effective October 31, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 24, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John C.
