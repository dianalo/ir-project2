(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   US Sprint Communication Co.'s operatinglosses in the third quarter of 1988 should be sharply reduced fromthe $165 million it lost in the same period of last year and the$112 million lost in the second quarter of this year, WilliamEsrey, United Telecommunications Inc. president and chief executiveofficer, said Monday.   Esrey said that based on results in July and August, US Sprintis expected to have pre-tax losses of no more than $35 million inthe quarter ending Sept. 30.   The long-distance telephone service is operated as a partnershipof United Telecom and GTE Corp. They now own equal amounts, butUnited Telecom will purchase an additional 30.1 percent interestfor more than $600 million in January 1989.   Esrey said factors contributing to the improved performance werecontinued growth in net revenue and improved control of expenses.He said the correction of billing system problems which adverselyaffected results in previous periods was a major factor.   Moving customer traffic from leased lines and microwavefacilities onto US Sprint's new fiber-optics network alsocontributed to operating efficiency, he said.   ``While much work remains to be done, we are very pleased withthe recent progress we have made,'' Esrey said. ``US Sprint is nowin position to exceed our internal short-term objectives.''</TEXT></DOC>
