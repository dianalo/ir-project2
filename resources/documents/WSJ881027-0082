The Nasdaq composite index slipped 0.93 to 385.19. The Nasdaq 100 index that measures the market's major non-financial stocks, many of them high-technology issues, slumped even more, falling 2.10 to 352.70.    No U.S. equity market is throwing off sparks these days, but without the kind of big takeover action that has buoyed big New York Stock Exchange issues, the OTC market particularly has been stumbling. Though the Nasdaq composite is outpacing most other market barometers for the year -- including the Dow Jones industrials and the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 index -- so far in October, things have turned sour.    This month, the Nasdaq composite has fallen 0.6% while the Dow Jones industrials have risen 2.5% and the Sandamp;P 500 has gained 3.9%.    OTC traders said that with relatively few individual investors playing the market, stocks are sometimes moving erratically at the whim of big institutional players.    &quot;Schizophrenia seems to reign supreme,&quot; said Tony Cecin, head OTC trader at Piper, Jaffray andamp; Hopwood in Minneapolis. He said stocks have been &quot;machined down&quot; for little or no reason and then just as quickly zoom up as the institutional investors who are playing the market start buying. &quot;Market-makers don't have any idea what to do in most of the stocks they're trading,&quot; he said.    Mr. Cecin, like other traders, maintained that the Big Board might have similar problems these days, were it not for its series of takeover deals. &quot;The only game in town is the takeover game, and we're not able to play in that game, by and large,&quot; he said. Nasdaq still has the huge takeover bid for Farmers Group, which closed unchanged at 72 1/8, but such action is rare.    Among the few other OTC takeover plays, C-TEC jumped 3 1/2 to 49 in light trading on speculation about a possible higher bid than the $43 a share offered Tuesday by a management group. And Delchamps fell 2 1/8 to 21 5/8 in heavy trading. Great Atlantic andamp; Pacific Tea withdrew its $30-a-share tender offer and $32-a-share merger proposal.    Home Intensive's plunge led the Nasdaq decliners list. The stock, which traded as high as 6 1/8 in July, dropped 1 3/4 to 2 1/2 in heavy trading.    The North Miami Beach, Fla., company, which provides home hemodialysis services and runs two kidney dialysis centers, said it was told Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Florida plans to slash reimbursement for home hemodialysis supplies and equipment by 48%, effective Jan. 1. The company said the proposed reimbursement structure would make it &quot;impossible to provide home dialysis services.&quot; It called this &quot;a potentially disastrous development for our more than 1,000 patients, who may have to find clinic services, if available.&quot;    The company complained that the Blue Cross decision is &quot;not consistent with existing Medicare law&quot; and said it will try to overturn the decision.    Golden Valley Microwave Foods lost 1 3/8 to 24 3/4. Although the microwave-popcorn maker's third-quarter net income rose 33%, income from operations rose only 10%, and pretax income was essentially flat.    The larger OTC stocks that institutions focus on mostly fell, while smaller OTC stocks held their ground. There were 904 advancing issues with volume of 25.9 million shares and 997 decliners with volume of a hefty 42.7 million shares. But among the smaller one-third of Nasdaq issues that aren't in the National Market System, advancing issues were ahead by 163-148, and advancing shares led in volume by 4.9 million to 3.1 million.    Nasdaq volume of 110.4 million shares continued the week's lethargic trading pace. Last November, the month after the stock market crash, Nasdaq averaged about 126 million shares a day. </TEXT></DOC>
