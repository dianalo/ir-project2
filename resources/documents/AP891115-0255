Reports Sharp Profit Slump</HEAD><DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   News Corp., Rupert Murdoch'sAustralia-based international media company, reported Wednesday itsfirst quarter earnings dropped 78 percent, partly because ofrevenue lost during a labor dispute.   News Corp. said it earned $28.7 million, or 23 cents perAmerican depository receipt (ADR), in the three months ended Sept.30, down from $133.1 million, or 83 cents per ADR, in the sameperiod a year earlier, when the company had a $61.2 millionafter-tax gain from asset sales.   Each ADR is equivalent to two News Corp. common shares. They aretraded on the New York Stock Exchange.   News Corp. said its revenue rose to $1.51 billion from $1.27billion a year earlier, but that its results were affected by a14-week dispute by pilots that eroded earnings at Ansett Airlines,which News Corp. jointly owns with TNT Ltd.   It did not say what the dispute had cost in terms of lostrevenue.   The company said its earnings also were affected by inclusionfrom Sept. 1 of operating results for its Sky Television operationsin Britain, and an increase in interest payments.   News Corp.'s U.S. holdings, which include the Twentieth CenturyFox film studio, the Fox television network and publicationsincluding TV Guide and the Daily Racing Form, provided the bulk ofsales and earnings for the company.   Murdoch had prepared shareholders for a lean profit year at thecompany's annual meeting Oct. 10, warning then that annual earningsmay ``not have their customary increase.''</TEXT></DOC>
