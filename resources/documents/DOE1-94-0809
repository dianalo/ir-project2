Computed tomographyand subtraction angiography are two other, non-invasive radiologicalmethods for examining the size and topography of the cavities of theheart, and echocardiography has meanwhile taken the first position inthe diagnosis of morphological heart disease. Fourier analysis and theFourier tansformation technique allow acquisition, recording and evaluationof quantitative data of the radionuclide ventriculography. Due to theweak spatial resolution of the scintigraphic phase analysis, the nextlogical development was to apply Fourier analysis to the cine-ventriculography,which unfortunately requires considerable computing efforts and time.A solution has now been found that combines the two image processingsystems and thus creates the basis for applying the Fourier analysisto all the diagnostic imaging methods, such as echocardiography, radiography,and nuclear medical methods.</TEXT></DOC>
