The primary reason that the debtor position decreased interms of current cost but increased in terms of market valuewas a sharper decline in foreign stock prices than indomestic ones during the year.   The department revised its methods for measuring the netinvestment position and began providing the two sets offigures this year. Previously, the data showed foreign assetsin the U.S. exceeding U.S. assets abroad for the first timein 1984, but the revised numbers put the turning point in1986 or 1987. The U.S. is said to be in &quot;debtor&quot; status whenforeign investment in the U.S. is greater, though the figuresdon't compare total assets.   On a market-value basis, foreign investment in the U.S. atthe end of 1990 totaled $2.241 trillion, up from $2.212trillion a year earlier. Meanwhile, U.S. investment abroad in1990 fell to $1.880 trillion from $1.944 trillion the yearbefore.   On a current-cost basis, foreign investors held $2.176trillion in U.S. assets at the end of 1990, compared with$2.112 trillion at the end of 1989. U.S. assets abroadtotaled $1.764 trillion at the end of last year, up from$1.673 trillion the year before.   The international investment position reflects capitalflows during the year, adjusted for price changes andexchange-rate changes.   The Commerce Department said the current-cost decrease inthe U.S. net debtor position in 1990 primarily reflectedexchange-rate appreciation of $44.6 billion -- mostly on U.S.assets abroad -- partly offset by net capital inflows of$28.6 billion, as foreign assets in the U.S. increased morerapidly than U.S. assets abroad. The U.S. net internationalinvestment position in 1990 also reflected a 5.5% increase inU.S. direct investment abroad and a 3% rise in foreign directinvestment in the U.S., the department said.</TEXT></DOC>
