The fines are being levied to settle government chargesgrowing out of an explosion at a nitroparaffin plant atSterlington, La., in May that killed eight IMC workers andinjured 120 people in the area. The plant, adjacent to IMCammonia plants, is operated by IMC for Angus. IMC is based inNorthbrook, Ill.</LP><TEXT>   Department officials said the fines, mostly to be paid byIMC, are the largest in the history of the OccupationalSafety and Health Administration, a department unit. Thebiggest previous fine was $6 million paid by Citgo PetroleumCorp. to settle OSHA charges stemming from a fire andexplosion at Citgo's Lake Charles, La., refinery last March,that killed six workers. The agency had proposed an $8.2million Citgo fine.   Like the Citgo settlement, the IMC-Angus agreementinvolves a new schedule of stiffer fines authorized late lastyear by Congress.   But the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union issued astatement highly critical of the settlement, reflectingfrequent assertions by unions that OSHA often bypasses themin reaching enforcement agreements with employers. In manyother instances, OSHA issues citations that may be contestedby the employer, and workers are allowed to recommendpenalties.   OCAW president Robert Wages called the settlement a&quot;sweetheart deal&quot; and &quot;a scandalous, sleazy maneuver.&quot; Hesaid it doesn't involve any penalties for willful or seriousviolations, which are often prominent in OSHA citations.&quot;These instant settlements are all smoke and mirrors,&quot; Mr.Wages said. He added, &quot;Ten million dollars may soundimpressive, but it's just another cost of doing business.&quot;   A Labor Department official said, &quot;To call a $10 millionsettlement a sweetheart deal is ridiculous.&quot; He said thesettlement &quot;sends a strong signal&quot; to employers thatviolations of OSHA standards that pose a workplace hazard&quot;simply will not be tolerated.&quot;   Gerard Scannell, the OSHA chief, said Mr. Wages wasnotified of the settlement plan two days ago but didn'trespond. Mr. Scannell said all of the OSHA citations wouldhave been willful if the companies hadn't agreed to thefines. He said the companies also agreed to corporation-wideabatement of unsafe practices.   The settlement is part of a stepped-up OSHA effortinvolving the chemical and petroleum industries in responseto numerous oil and chemical plant explosions and fires inthe past few years. A major problem cited by the agency isthe use of contractors for maintenance or other work, whooften are criticized for showing less safety diligence thanthe plant's owner.</TEXT></DOC>
