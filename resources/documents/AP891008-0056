Manuel Antonio Noriega movedSunday to gain the backing of the Panamanian people following anattempted coup, thanking them for ``support that reinforced'' hisleadership.   A small group of officers and troopers of Panama's DefenseForces tried to oust Noriega Tuesday but the revolt was crushed byloyalists.   Sunday's editions of the government-owned La Republica newspaperwere filled with articles praising Noreiga and pictures of thegeneral, commander of the Defense Forces. One headline read, ``Ageneral with nerves of steel.''   A message from Noriega was broadcast on nationwide televisionand radio at the end of an editorial on a military news program.   In his message Noriega thanked Panamanians for ``thedemonstrations of moral and spiritual support that reinforced theposition of MAN (Manuel Antonio Noriega) and of his men in thecritical moment when the fate of Panama and its national liberationmovement were at stake.''   ``Those who think that the cause will fail if one man falls aremistaken,'' he said.   Noriega has accused the United States of backing the failed coup.   Washington has applied political and economic pressure in aneffort to oust Noriega since February 1988 when he was indicted inFlorida on drug- trafficking charges. Noriega says the indictmentsare part of a U.S. plot to renege on the treaties to turn thePanama Canal over to Panama at the end of the century.   The news program's editorial declared, ``We have a general fortough times commanding our troops.''   It said more ``surprise attacks'' could be in store and added,``We won't be caught with our guard down.''   More than 60 soldiers and political figures, including threemembers of Noriega's general staff, have been arrested in thecrackdown since the attempted coup.</TEXT></DOC>
