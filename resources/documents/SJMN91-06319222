He has fretted about the need for swift action,but said lawmakers have never shown the ability to quickly deal with painfulbudget decisions.;   &quot;He hasn't called one, but he hasn't ruled it out,&quot; saidWisner. &quot;Calling them back here is one thing. Getting them to pass bills thatWilson can sign is another.&quot;;   A more immediate budget decision is expectedlate today, when the Senate Rules Committee decides how to comply withProposition 140-ordered budget cuts that imperil two key watchdog agencies,the Office of Legislative Analyst and the Auditor General's office.Proposition 140, passed by voters last year and upheld by the state SupremeCourt, puts caps on lawmakers' terms and ordered cuts in their budgets.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  THOMAS FARRAGHER, Mercury News Sacramento Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Sacramento  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911114  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  593  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, November 14, 199100319222,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
