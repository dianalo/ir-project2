Bloch, who is under investigation bythe FBI.   The president refused to reveal details of the case, noting thatthe investigation is still under way. But he said: ``Any time aperson is ... allegedly involved in something like betraying hiscountry, that to me is a very serious matter.''   Asked about possible damage to U.S. security, Bush, a former CIAdirector, replied: ``I don't think anyone could give you a fulldamage assessment'' at this time. He added that the case, if true,``doesn't help'' further better relations between the superpowers,even though everyone knows that ``espionage goes on.''   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Secretary of StateJames A. Baker III informed Bush of the Bloch investigation``within minutes after he learned of this.'' He declined to saywhen that was.   Asked why Bush commented on a case still under investigation,Fitzwater replied, ``We normally don't have a situation like this.''   The president's remarks came as Bloch's one-time superior,former U.S. Ambassador to Austria Ronald Lauder said he ``did notlike'' Bloch. ``There was something about him that bothered me,''Lauder said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' program.   Lauder, now a Republican candidate for mayor of New York, said,``The more I got to know him the more I realized there wassomething dramatically wrong.'' He said he had Bloch, who wassecond-in-command for most of his seven years at the Viennaembassy, recalled in July 1987 because of ``insubordination.''   But The New York Times today quoted the former director generalof the Foreign Service, George S. Vest, as saying, ``It was timefor (Bloch) to go, anyway, so we brought him back. He was notpulled back prematurely.'' Vest said Bloch returned to attend aseminar for top diplomats.   A U.S. official said today that Lauder was upset that Bloch wentbehind his back and lobbied against a Justice Departmentrecommendation to place Austrian President Kurt Waldheim on a listof people banned from the United States because of Nazi activities.   Bloch and Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock, a Waldheimsupporter, ``were very tight'' over that affair, said the official,who spoke only on condition he not be named. A year after the April1986 recommendation was made, Waldheim was placed on the list.   Stansfield Turner, who was CIA director during the Carteradministration before Bloch's embassy stint, said ``it's not verylikely (Bloch) would know the specific names and details''concerning CIA agents in Vienna because such information is notnormally shared with officials outside the agency.   However, a person in Bloch's high position ``could have gotteninto things that weren't normally his business'' because of hisaccess to the embassy's cable section, Turner said on ``GoodMorning America.''   Bush administration, legislative and law enforcement officialsskirted questions Sunday about the inquiry into Bloch, thehighest-ranking U.S. official ever implicated in an espionageinvestigation involving the Soviet Union.   Bloch, who has not been charged with any crime, reportedly wasfilmed by U.S. officials earlier this year passing a briefcase to aknown Soviet KGB agent in a European capital.   The State Department and the FBI are ``pursuing the inquirythoroughly in order to identify the compromised security which hasoccurred and the appropriate steps,'' the State Department said.Bloch's building pass and security clearance have been lifted.   ``My directions are really not to comment on this case,'' an FBIspokesman said Sunday. ``You're talking about security matters.''   Although reports remained sketchy, the picture was emerging of a54-year-old career diplomat who was frustrated by his lack ofadvancement while serving in Vienna under two political appointees.   Vienna, because of geography, traditionally has been a hotbedfor East-West spy activity.   Bloch's close friend, Foreign Minister Mock, was quoted Sundayas saying he heard about the recent allegations of espionagethrough Austrian channels three weeks before the news broke inWashington on Friday.   Mock said in the Austrian tabloid Kurier there was ``a certainsuspicion on the U.S. side reaching back into the 1970s'' aboutBloch's activities.   Bloch also served in the newly opened U.S. Embassy in EastBerlin in 1974 as economic counselor, having been transferred fromWest Berlin.   Bloch's neighbors in an upper-class neighborhood in Washingtontold reporters that Bloch, who had been under obvious surveillanceby the FBI until news accounts of the spy probe aired late Friday,had not been seen since then.   ABC News reported Sunday night he was under the FBI's watch at aprivate home north of New York City with his wife and daughter.   By all accounts, Bloch, born in Austria, had access to sensitiveintelligence material during his career, and officials expressedconcern he could cause serious damage to U.S. interests if heshared his secrets with foreign powers.   The Wall Street Journal reported in today's editions that Blochhelped shape the State Department's policy on transfers ofsensitive technology to the Soviets and actively participated inthe decision earlier this year to relax U.S. policy on transfers.   One senior State Department official who worked with Bloch toldthe Journal the most sensitive intelligence information on Sovietand European security matters bypassed Bloch's office. But Bloch,as an office director, had access to general intelligenceinformation, including a morning intelligence summary so sensitiveofficials are required to read it and return it to a waitingcourier without copying it, the official said.   Those who knew Bloch well ruled out spying for money orideology. Mock said he was ``deeply shaken and really shattered''by the allegations.   Sources told ABC that Bloch claimed he spied because he fellinto a Soviet sex trap but that investigators have discounted thestory.   Some sources pointed to Bloch's frustration over having beenpassed over for an ambassadorship after serving under politicalappointees in Austria and running the embassy in Vienna for a time.   One of the ambassadors Bloch served was Helene von Damm, anAustrian-born political appointee by former President Reagan whocaused a scandal in Viennese society by marrying Peter Guertler, ahotel owner.   She resigned in June 1985, citing speculation that her marriageconstituted a conflict of interest with her diplomatic duties.Bloch ran the embassy after Von Damm resigned until Lauder arrivedalmost a year later.</TEXT></DOC>
