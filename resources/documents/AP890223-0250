Two officials of failed thrifts who became regulators are nowtargets of criminal investigations, and a federal prosecutor sayshe's thinks there will be more.   Most of the people hired to handle the billions of dollars' worthof property and loans seized from failed thrifts are honest,officials said. Yet they expect to find more bad apples.   ``I would not be surprised to see one or two instances of thatemerging as the (Justice Department's bank fraud) task forceproceeds,'' said U.S. Attorney Marvin Collins of Dallas.   A longtime savings industry official agreed. ``I would imaginethere would be one or two others when you hire 800 people. Maybe 80or 50 or 30 people _ some percentage that drops over the line,'' theofficial said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``It willtake a long time before it all gets out.''   Collins said fraud may be continuing in the thrifts themselves.``Some people feel they can take advantage because the system iscurrently overloaded by investigations,'' said Collins, who's beenworking on Sandamp;L fraud since the mid-1980s. ``We'll be very attentiveto them.''   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board hired as many as 800 people _ a``high percentage'' of them from failed Sandamp;Ls _ without performingbackground checks, government and industry officials said.   When employees of failed thrifts are hired as regulators,``that's a risk, sure,'' acknowledged bank board spokesman BillFulwider.   Still, he added, ``The assumption is it's generally not theirfault the institution went down. They understand the assets, andthey have expertise that's valuable.''   Two cases illustrate the pitfalls.   Philip S. Noons was hired by the Federal Savings andamp; Loan InsuranceCorp. in April 1986 after Mainland Savings, a Houston high-fliersuspected of widespread fraud, was declared insolvent. Noons hadbeen a project manager at Mainland, and he went to FSLIC managingMainland assets.   On Feb. 8, the FBI arrested Noons and his 31-year-old twinbrother, Thomas, and charged them with conspiring to embezzle moneyfrom the FSLIC by grossly undervaluing Mainland loans acquired bythe FSLIC and then selling them to two Houston companies on behalfof themselves.   One package of 16 loans was valued by Philip Noons at $1,500,prosecutors said, while the FSLIC said the package is actually worth$1.6 million. In another case, the brothers paid $692,821 for a loanworth $4 million, the FBI said.   The Noonses' attorney, David Berg, says that his clients areinnocent and that the government has overreacted and overstated theamounts involved because of pressure for Sandamp;L action followingPresident Bush's new plan. Neither brother was implicated in anywrongdoing while at Mainland, Berg said.   Regulators have also drawn fire for the hiring of Stuart Jones, aformer real estate loan officer for Richardson Savings andamp; LoanAssociation.   Jones was hired in October as deputy director of the bank boardin charge of disposing of the agency's massive real estateportfolio, despite criminal referrals to the FBI about his conductat Richardson, officials said.   In December, when officials in Washington learned about therequest for an FBI probe made by Dallas regulators, Jones wastransferred to a post that does not handle selling assets, Fulwidersaid. The investigation continues, he said.   Despite those two cases and suspicions of others, regulators saythey do not believe they have a significant problem.   ``Until these two instances surfaced, for all the rapid buildupit seems to have worked pretty well,'' Fulwider said. ``Out ofseveral hundred people who have been added throughout the bank boardstaff we don't seem to have encountered any real problems in termsof numbers.''   But the bank board may not be aware of the full extent of theproblem. According to Collins, when the Justice Department taskforce uncovers evidence against an Sandamp;L official now working forregulators, it can't tip off the agency because of confidentialitylaws.   A private attorney specializing in bank fraud told the AP of acase he encountered where a former Sandamp;L official was hired by thegovernment to handle repossessed properties even though he has afinancial interest in some of the properties _ a probableconflict-of-interest violation.   ``As many people as they had and as many problems as they had, Iwouldn't believe that's the only problem,'' said the attorney, aformer white-collar crime prosecutor who asked not to be namedbecause the incident involved a confidential attorney-clientrelationship.   As the Sandamp;L industry was deregulated and high-flying thrifts tookoff into speculative and sometimes fraudulent endeavors, federalregulators found their agencies grossly understaffed and unable tokeep up.   By the mid-1980s, a hiring push was approved, and the FederalHome Loan Bank Board found itself needing not only examiners butalso real-estate and banking experts who could help handle the giantportfolios the government was seizing.   The people with experience and available for hire were the oneswho had worked at the failed thrifts.   Until August 1986, they were hired under Schedule B, a governmentprogram that waives background checks to speed up the process,Fulwider said. After that, the bank board contracted with an agencyto check new hires for criminal records. Checks have never been doneretroactively.   The bank board made 6,000 criminal referrals to the FBI frominsolvent thrifts, asking the bureau to look into specifictransactions and individuals.   The collapse of the Sandamp;L industry is expected to cost some $100billion to resolve. A large portion of that cost, officials havesaid, results from mismanagement and outright fraud by Sandamp;Lexecutives.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Scott McCartney is the AP Southwest regionalreporter, based in Dallas.</TEXT></DOC>
