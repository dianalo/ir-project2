Post Large Jumps in First-Period Profit </HL><AUTHOR> Caleb Solomon (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> TX P CHV SUN </CO><IN> PET ERN </IN><TEXT>   Texaco Inc., Chevron Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co. and Sun Co. extended the string of major oil companies reporting large increases in first-quarter earnings.    The same factors sparked the gains for this second wave of concerns to report: bigger refining margins and sharp increases in petrochemical profits. These so-called downstream operations more than offset, and in fact were aided by, lower crude prices in the quarter.    Texaco's net income more than doubled and Chevron's profit surged 81%. Both companies had one-time gains in the quarter from the sale of Angolan properties, but the earnings increases would have been large even without the gains.    Phillips reversed a year-earlier loss by posting net of $130 million, or 55 cents a share. It had a small one-time gain in the quarter. Sun's earnings surged 58%.    Despite the robust increases, many oil companies expressed caution over the long-term outlook for industry earnings. Phillips, which has drastically reduced operations in recent years, said it makes plans based on the assumption that oil prices will be flat or rise slowly. &quot;We don't expect to see oil prices rise much above the low $20 level, discounting inflation, even 10 years from today,&quot; said C.J. Silas, chairman of Phillips.    The results didn't offer any big surprises to Wall Street. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Texaco gained 37.5 cents to close at $48.875; Chevron closed at $49, up 62.5 cents; and Phillips rose 25 cents to close at $17.875. Sun, which released results after the market closed, finished at $60.125, up 50 cents, in Big Board trading.    Texaco posted earnings increases in the same areas as the other big oil companies to report so far. James W. Kinnear, president and chief executive officer, cited &quot;improved downstream operating margins in the U.S. and strong petrochemical results.&quot; Texaco's domestic refining and marketing operations posted operating profit of $92 million, compared with a loss of $55 million a year earlier.    Chevron also turned a loss into a profit in domestic refining and marketing, as lower crude prices contributed to significantly higher margins.    Petrochemical earnings increased across the board. Phillips, which is more dependent on chemical operations than many of its competitors, said prices and sales increased. Its chemical profits more than doubled in the quarter, as did Chevron's, aided by lower crude prices, the feedstock for petrochemicals.    Exploration and production operations, the mainstay of the major oil companies, lagged because of lower crude prices. Radnor, Pa.-based Sun said domestic crude oil prices averaged $14.45 a barrel in the latest quarter, compared with $15.27 a barrel a year earlier.    Higher natural gas prices and volumes only partly offset the drop in crude prices. Sun said natural gas prices averaged $1.74 a thousand cubic feet, up from $1.50 a thousand cubic feet in the year-earlier quarter. Much of the price increase came early in the latest quarter, and prices have fallen sharply since then.    At White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco, the company posted a $66 million gain from the sale of half of its interest in an offshore-Angola venture. A spokesman said the sale isn't part of Texaco's planned revamping, in which the company expects to sell at least $5 billion in assets.    Earnings for Chevron, based in San Francisco, included a $191 million gain on the sale of a portion of its exploration and production operations in Angola and a $20 million gain from windfall profit tax refunds. Year-earlier earnings included total gains of $98 million from asset dispositions and windfall profit tax refunds. Chevron's 1987 results were restated to conform with new accounting standards.    At Phillips, based in Bartlesville, Okla., the latest quarter included a $17 million gain from the settlement of gas contract disputes. The gain was partially offset by a $10 million charge for a special employee separation program.    ---                          1988              1987                       in      per       in      per                    millions  share   millions  share  chg.
