The dead were taken by small funeral processions to the maincemetery of this ancient southern port and a Palestinian graveyardin the nearby village of Darb el-Seem after Moslem noon prayers.   Sirens wailed as mourners started home to the Mieh Mieh refugeecamp, target of the air raid. Guerrillas and civilians scattered,ducking for cover as two jets flashed past.   The Palestine Liberation Organization originally planned massfunerals for the 15 people killed at Mieh Mieh, on Sidon's southernfringe, and four guerrillas killed in fighting east of the city withmilitia allies of Israel.   A guerrilla officer, who would not give his name, said plans werechanged because ``we just couldn't risk mass gatherings. WithIsrael's appetite for attacking at its peak, we figured it's prudentto keep a low profile.''   In Washington, the State Department urged all parties to holdtheir fire.   Those involved ``must keep in mind that the pattern of action andreaction and the continuing violence in Lebanon has a negativeimpact which serves the interests of no one,'' spokesman CharlesRedman said. ``Restraint would serve the interests of all andcontribute to security and stability.''   Wednesday's rocket attack destroyed 30 buildings of a guerrillabase in Mieh Mieh. Police said rescuers searched the rubble allnight and dug out nine bodies.   They said the bodies were of three guerrillas and a family of six_ parents and four children, two sons and two daughters aged 6 to15. Six people were reported killed and 40 wounded immediately afterthe raid on the base, which belonged to the Fatah guerrilla groupled by PLO chief Yasser Arafat.   Fighting began in hills east of Sidon soon afterward. The SouthLebanon Army, a predominantly Christian militia that acts asIsrael's surrogate, attacked positions held by Palestinians andleftist Lebanese militiamen for the first time since 1985.   A statement by the militia said its fighters captured a strategichill overlooking Jezzine, the largest Christian town in southLebanon, and killed four guerrillas of the Fatah-RevolutionaryCouncil faction led by terrorist Abu Nidal.   It acknowledged one militiaman killed and one wounded and saidthe attackers captured three followers of Abu Nidal, whose real nameis Sabry al-Banna.   Palestinian sources at Sidon's Ein el-Hilweh refugee campconfirmed the losses and said Abu Nidal's commander east of Sidon,known by the code name Abu Rabie, was among the dead.   Guerrillas had used the outpost to to harass Jezzine, 11 mileswest of Sidon, with mortar and sniper fire.   Only one of the 19 Israeli air raids into Lebanon this yearkilled more people than the strike at Mieh Mieh. The first attack,Jan. 3, took 26 lives and wounded 30 people at a guerrilla basenorth of Sidon.   Both police and PLO spokesmen said Wednesday's raid was the worstin terms of destruction and guerrilla casualties.   ``Mieh Mieh has suffered the most severe destruction sinceIsrael's 1982 invasion'' of Lebanon, said a police spokesman inSidon, whose name cannot be used because of regulations.   The air raid on the refugee camp, and a later strike Wednesday ata guerrilla base outside Beirut, were the third and fourth since aShiite Moslem driver detonated a car bomb last week in an armyconvoy in the ``security zone'' Israel maintains just north of theborder.   Eight israeli soldiers were killed, and seven soldiers and twolocal women wounded.   Israeli fighter-bombers struck Palestinian and Shiite guerrillabases Friday and Sunday, killing 21 people and wounding 34.   On Tuesday, Israeli troops and their militia allies foiled twoattempts by Palestinian guerrillas to infiltrate northern Israel.</TEXT></DOC>
