No sooner did controversy die down over China's surprise sale ofmedium-range missiles to Saudi Arabia than reports circulated thatBeijing was selling missile technology to Argentina and Pakistan,and that Pakistan used the technology to produce a missile capableof carrying nuclear warheads, which would be a threat to India.   All sides denied the reports, but they highlighted China'sgrowing role as an international arms merchant with increasinglysophisticated wares _ and seemingly few scruples about the buyers.   A case in point is China's much-publicized sale of Silkwormmissiles to Iran after selling fighter planes to Iran's enemy, Iraq.   Primarily a donor of small arms to African and Southeast Asianrevolutionaries in the 1960s, China has become the fourth largestweapons seller to the Third World, after the Soviet Union, UnitedStates and France, according to the U.S. government.   China sold an estimated $1.5 billion worth of weapons in 1986and about $2 billion worth in 1987, according to U.S. figures.China does not release any figures, and Chinese officials refusedto discuss arms sales.   China still lags far behind the world's leading arms seller, theSoviet Union, which had 1986 sales of more than $15 billion. Butweapons make up an increasing share of Chinese exports, from lessthan 2 percent in 1978 to more than 5 percent last year.   For that it has mainly to thank the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war. Ithas sold $4.5 billion worth of arms to both sides, according toU.S. government estimates, including the Silkworms to Iran thatgave China its first taste of political backlash.   The United States last year briefly halted its program ofexpanding high-tech sales to China to show its pique over theSilkworms, with which Iran threatens Persian Gulf shipping. Chinainsists Iran gets the Silkworms from someone else.   Iran in turn reportedly is unhappy over China's recent sale ofCSS-2 missiles to Saudi Arabia, substitutes for U.S. F-15 fightersthat the U.S. Congress blocked.   The missiles have a range of 2,200 miles and can be fitted withnuclear warheads. Iran, with which Saudi Arabia recently severeddiplomatic relations, is a logical target.   Missiles and other sophisticated weapons still account for onlya small portion of China's arms sales, which consist mostly ofsmall arms and field artillery. However, its tanks and fighterplanes have become increasingly popular, especially since Chinabegan upgrading them with British and Italian technology.   Pakistan, a regular buyer of Chinese aircraft, replaces theengines in them with British ones.   Foreign sources who keep watch on arms deals say sales abroadhave helped fund weapons development for the Chinese military,whose share of the state budget dropped from 17.5 percent in 1979to less than 10 percent in 1986 as the government puts priority oneconomic development.   But China also is believed to be seeking influence andrecognition as an important player in world trouble spots, even atthe cost of criticism.   China's main customers are developing countries embroiled inregional conflicts and who don't want to depend solely on theSoviet Union or the United States. Thailand, which buys most of itsarms from the United States, bought an estimated $10 million worthof tanks, armored personnel carriers and artillery from China lastyear in part as a gesture of independence.   Low prices, speedy delivery and simple weapons design that caneasily be maintained by low-tech Third World armies are otherattractions. The tanks China sold Thailand, for example, cost about$200,000 each _ less than one-fifth the price of U.S. tanks thatThailand bought a few months later.   The Chinese tanks were delivered within months of order. TheU.S. tanks have yet to arrive.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tue AMs, June 21</NOTE></DOC>
