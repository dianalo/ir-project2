Analysts said the charge had been expected, in light ofactions by the Michigan Public Service Commission. In thefirst nine months of 1990, CMS earned $145 million, or $1.78a share. In 1989, net income was $312 million, or $3.80 ashare.</LP><TEXT>   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,CMS jumped $1.75 to closed at $27 a share.   CMS announced the charge after an administrative law judgefor Michigan's Public Service Commission proposed yesterdaythat CMS Energy be allowed to recoup $1.34 billion of the$2.14 billion it hasn't recovered from its abandoned nuclearplant in Midland, Mich. CMS had asked for rate increases thatwould allow it to recover the full $2.14 billion.   The judge's recommendation won't become final until thefull commission issues a final order, which is expected inthe latter half of next year. But CMS opted to take a chargenow, based on the judge's recommendation.   CMS's Consumer's Power Co. utility abandoned its effort tobuild the Midland nuclear plant in 1984 after spending $4.1billion. The ruling relates to the amount CMS hasn'trecovered after converting part of the plant to a gas-firedcogeneration facility.   The recommended recovery would occur over a 10-year periodand would provide the company an annual electric rateincrease of $111.5 million during that time.   CMS is still in litigation over the amount it may recoverthrough electric rates for the costs of the cogenerationfacility that began operation in March.</TEXT></DOC>
