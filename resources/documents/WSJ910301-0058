Now thedivision is deep in the Iraqi desert when, suddenly, there itis:   Iraq's Republican Guard.</LP><TEXT>   It is 5 p.m. Tuesday. And the Third Armored Division isabout to launch the climactic two-day battle that cuts theguard to shreds -- and ends the Gulf War.   The American troops start off with a tremendous advantage:The Republican Guard, expecting an attack from the south, iscaught totally by surprise. Its big guns, in fact, arepointed the wrong way.   Unlike many comrades of theirs in other divisions, though,the guard troops are ready for a fight. They quickly turn tobattle their enemy.   The roar of incoming Iraqi artillery announces thebeginning of the battle. Fighting erupts on three sides ofthe U.S. convoy. The American forces immediately strike back.The evening horizon is dotted with flashes from U.S. rockets,missiles and artillery. The earth shakes with concussions.Master Sgt. Richard Cox, 34, of Cincinnati, Ohio, looks upand says simply: &quot;They asked for it.&quot;   This is how a high-tech war is fought: U.S. units usingradar pick up the arc of incoming shells. They feed the dataon the arcs into the computers of their Multiple-LaunchRocket Systems. From that, the systems figure out where theshells are coming from. Then, suddenly, there is a &quot;Whoosh]&quot;That's the sound as the systems begin shooting &quot;six packs&quot; ofrockets back at the enemy gun crews, spraying them withclusters of bomblets.   Heavy thunderclouds roll in. Darkness comes early. ThenApache helicopters suddenly spurt out of black clouds,spitting streaks of missiles that go &quot;clumpf&quot; as they hitIraqi tanks and bunkers.   Even scarier, tank-killing Warthog jets can be heard butnot seen. Their locations are detectable only by the streamsof tracer bullets they direct at enemy tanks along the front.   Many of the Iraqi defenders are clearly stunned by theferocity of the attack. Eerily, as the U.S. troops passthrough layers of defenses, some Republican Guards just standaround, watching.   But the battle is sometimes confusing for the Americans,too. At one point, Sgt. Glen Wilson, 27, of New Haven, Ohio,finds his tank between two Iraqi armored vehicles and facingan Iraqi T-72 tank.   The gunner trains his weapon on the tank, fires, scores ahit -- and keeps moving.   As the battle wears on into Wednesday, the voice of thecommander of the division's First Brigade, Col. Bill Nash,rasps over the command frequency on the radio. He isassigning missions to Apaches and Warthogs in the darknessoverhead. After tersely polling his units, making sure thatnone is close to an enemy bunker, he calls in one potentApache code-named &quot;Death Dealer.&quot;   It quickly attacks -- and creates a huge ball of orangefire that soars over the battlefield, visible miles away.   Calling in the pilots to do the key work clearly isfrustrating to some of Col. Nash's junior officers. Oneblurts over the radio: &quot;Get a company in there and shoot 'emup] Give them a freaking chance to die]&quot;   But as Col. Nash says later: &quot;If I can send them{aircraft} over the hill and kill people, why should I sendover my guys to do it?&quot;   The luxury of having others do the heavy lifting ends lateWednesday. The brigade's armored column becomes sointermingled with fleeing Iraqi units that Col. Nash can nolonger safely call in the Warthogs.   The battle soon turns nastier. The brigade's lead tankunit encounters a series of dug-in Iraqi T-62 tanks inbunkers. &quot;At that point, I thought I was going to lose awhole bunch of guys,&quot; Maj. John Lough of Bridgeport, W.Va.,says later.   But the Iraqi gunners appear to be confused. They allowprecious seconds to pass before aiming their guns -- and thatis just enough time for the M1A1 tanks and the BradleyFighting Vehicles of the First Brigade to kill them.   Wednesday night brings troubles for the U.S. tankers. Adust storm has blinded their fancy range-finding lasers. Theysee mysterious, slow-moving hot spots glide across theirinfra-red targeting screens, but they can't tell what theyare.   The fighting goes on all night. There is a great deal ofconfusion, partly because pockets of Iraqi stragglers dot thefield. Some are fighting, some are waiting to surrender --and it is impossible to discern in the darkness and dustwhich is doing which. Col. Nash has his baggage train --about 550 trucks and support vehicles -- surrounded byBradley fighting vehicles to guard them from the stragglers.   As the night wears on, the battle ends. It doesn't so muchstop as fade away with the fleeing Iraqis.   The toll of the Third Armored Division's First Brigade:Two men killed and three wounded when their Bradley FightingVehicle is hit by a T-72.   At dawn Thursday morning, the situation becomes clearer.The mysterious slow-moving spots on the targeting screens, itturns out, had been a herd of camels. Their corpses litterthe battlefield. The desert floor, in fact, is a mess. As faras the eye can see, it is dotted with pieces of plastic fromthe missiles, aircraft machine gun rounds and wrecked armoredvehicles.   Soldiers around the baggage train tune in to the morningnews on the Voice of America. Only then do they learn of theimminent cease-fire, which began at midnight Washington time,but 8 a.m. Thursday here. They are tired. And they arejubilant.   Lt. Tawanda K. Thomas, 25, of Trenton, N.J., a reservistwho had traveled with the baggage column, issues anunderstatement. &quot;Personally,&quot; she says, she is &quot;very happythat it's over.&quot;   Nearby, knots of confused Iraqi prisoners of war sitclustered in circles of concertina wire. They stare at theAmericans, talk quietly and devour packets of the Army's newfield rations, called Meals Ready to Eat, a title some U.S.soldiers insist contains three separate lies.   &quot;They weren't told to attack,&quot; says Capt. Tom Lewis, ofWindber, Pa., after interviewing some of the prisoners. &quot;Evena battalion commander that we interviewed said he had noorders to attack at all, and just had orders to sit there.&quot;   Capt. Lewis's conclusion is that the Iraqis had the fightblasted out of them by the U.S. air war and subsequentartillery attack. &quot;They have been shelled so much they wereready to give up,&quot; he says.   Col. Nash's men get to the job of inspecting and blowingup bunkers. The bunkers reveal what U.S. commanders call&quot;very professional&quot; plans to annihilate a U.S. force -- but aU.S. force attacking from the south.   The bunkers also contain huge stores of anti-tankammunition, including Soviet-made Sagger missiles. Sitting inthe middle of the desert after the fighting has stopped, anamazing thing happens all around: Moment after moment, at allpoints of the compass, there are sudden explosions andfireballs as bunker after bunker, tank after tank, isdynamited.   After being dynamited, the T-52 and T72 tanks burn. Atfirst, they make a sound like popcorn popping as theirturrets blow off. That's the warning that the ammunition andshells inside are about to go. When they do, the tracerbullets of the defeated army shoot out through the turrethole and arch across the Iraqi sky.</TEXT></DOC>
