The combination of real-timeUS and Doppler studies well demonstrates complications such as ectasia,false aneurysm, stenosis, and thrombosis. Statistical studies with kappatest show no significant difference between duplex US and DSA in thediagnosis of abnormalities and complications. Duplex UX is a reliablemethod for lower-limber arterial bypass graft follow-up survey.</TEXT></DOC>
