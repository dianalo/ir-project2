One provides for pre-notification of missile test launches. Theother sets the ground rules for joint experiments to monitorunderground nuclear tests.   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said theSoviets had initially demanded a broader pre-notificationarrangement, but accepted the initial U.S. proposal when theirdemand was turned down.   The agreement on monitoring tests also appeared to besidetracked until senior U.S. and Soviet arms control specialistsmet Sunday night.   On Saturday, Reagan administration officials said they did notexpect to have those agreements ready for the signatures of theleaders during the summit.   ``Things have changed,'' the official said.   Under the pre-notification agreement, which was negotiated aspart of the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, each sidewould notify the other in advance of the time, place and intendedtarget of ballistic missile test launches.   ``We had proposed just lifting that section out of START,'' theofficial said. But the Soviets objected, and wanted to include whatthey called other ``confidence-building measures,'' includingnotification of tests involving air-launched cruise missiles andother weapons.   The other likely agreement is a protocol for a JointVerification Experiment to test a new means of monitoringcompliannce with the Threshhold Test Ban Treaty, which was signedon Oct. 7, 1974, but never ratified by the Senate.   The administration has accused the Soviets of ``likely''exceeding the treaty's ceiling of 150 kiloton for nuclear testexplosions, a charge the Soviets deny. And the administration hasinsisted that the Soviets allow use of a new technology known asCORRTEX to supplement existing seismic measuring devices.   Signing of the protocol would clear the way for tests scheduledthis summer at U.S. and Soviet sites, and would virtually guaranteecompletion of a related pact, the Peaceful Nuclear ExplosionsTreaty, signed on May 28, 1976, barring the two sides from peacefulexplosions of more than 150 kilotons.   Reagan and Gorbachev were meeting to assess whether face-to-facediplomacy can remove some of the stumbling blocks that have keptthe superpowers from agreeing on the START treaty to sharply reducetheir arsenals of nuclear weapons.   A major breakthrough was unlikely, but a joint team of seniorU.S. and Soviet negotiators went to work Sunday night to discussverification issues, among the most difficult in the search for anaccord.   When Reagan and Gorbachev started their series of summitmeetings, of which Moscow is the fourth, the hope developed thatthey might agree on sharp cuts _ from 30 to as much as 50 percent _in the superpowers' stockpiles of their biggest weapons.   So far, chiefly because of verification and the issue of StarWars testing, an agreement has been elusive.   Gorbachev made it clear in his statement greeting Reagan onSunday that he was determined to ``preserve'' the 1972Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty which restrains testing for the StarWars missile defense program.   Still, Gennady Gerasimov, the Soviet foreign ministry spokesman,said his government was willing to join in a mutual pledge toadhere to the treaty for a specified period.   Gorbachev said, however, another summit with Reagan was ``quitepossible'' if the treaty could be completed during the less thaneight months remaining in the Reagan administration.   Not having that accord in hand, Reagan and Gorbachev onWednesday will have a ceremonial exchange of a more limited treatyto abolish their land-based missiles in the range of 300 to 3,400miles.   The treaty was signed at the summit meeting in Washington lastDecember, but the Senate held up ratification until severalverification procedures were clarified.   Roman Popadiuk, a White House spokesman, said that U.S. andSoviet working groups convened Sunday night after the meetingbetween Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet ForeignMinister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, which lasted from 7:30 p.m. to9:30 p.m.   Paul Nitze was the chairman of the U.S. team negotiating armscontrol issues, and Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne Ridgwaywas heading the American teams discussing human rights, regionaland bilateral issues.   The Soviet arms control team is headed by Marshal SergeiAkhromeyev, the Soviet Chief of Staff and deputy minister ofdefense, said Gerasimov. Aleksandr Bessmertnykh, the deputy foreignminister, was heading the Soviet team discussing other issues, hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
