F. Dale Robertson said most of the new habitat areas will rangefrom 1,000 to 2,000 acres in size, and will serve as protection fornesting owls as well as providing ``stepping stones'' between largerareas, totaling more than 1.6 million acres, already protected asowl habitats.   In the Olympic National Forest, the new habitat areas may be aslarge as 3,000 acres each, he said.   In all, the special habitat areas are expected to reduce theannual timber harvest on national forests in Oregon and Washingtonby about 180 million board feet.   Each of the 13 national forests that have owls will share in thelinkage system. The exact number will not be determined until theforests submit final management plans to ensure that spotted owlpopulations will be maintained.   ``This has been an extremely difficult decision to make, but Ibelieve it strikes a reasonable balance between the two conflictinggoals of sustaining spotted owl populations and providing timbersupplies that are vital to the economies of Oregon and Washington,''Robertson said.   The Forest Service, a USDA agency, has been embroiled incontroversy concerning its management plans for spotted owlhabitats, notably in the Pacific Northwest where there are concernsthat protection of the birds could adversely affect the timberindustry.   However, Robertson said the controversy has not been confined tohis agency, noting that a lawsuit against Interior's Bureau of LandManagement has resulted in an injunction prohibiting BLM fromharvesting mature timber on some lands the agency administers inOregon.   Also, the Fish and Wildlife Service is being challenged in courtover its 1987 refusal to designate the owl a threatened orendangered species.   Meantime, authorities in Oregon voted last week to deny a placeon the state list of endangered or threatened species to arobin-sized seabird called the marbled murrelet after biologistswere unable to determine the bird's population.   ``We simply don't have good baseline data on the murrelet'spopulation size nor any trends indicating changes in thatpopulation,'' said Rod Ingram, chief of the wildlife division forthe Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission.   The Oregon chapter of the Audubon Society and the Oregon NaturalResources Council had petitioned to place the bird on the list underthe new Oregon Endangered Species Act last January.</TEXT></DOC>
