The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 42.33, or 1.47%,to 2930.20. It was the largest gain in the index since April16, when it rose 53.71. Advancing issues outnumbereddecliners, 1,155 to 486 on the New York Stock Exchange wherevolume was a strong 181,900,000 shares.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This is an interest-rate rally,&quot; said Dale Tills, managerof institutional stock trading at Charles Schwab.   Following Tuesday's cuts in the Federal Reserve Board'sdiscount rate and the federal funds rate, major banks slashedtheir prime lending rates yesterday to 8.5% from 9%. (Thediscount rate is the rate the Fed charges on borrowings bymember banks, while the fed funds rate is the rate bankscharge each other on overnight loans.)   The prime is a benchmark for many consumer and businessloans, and traders interpreted the cut as an importantpsychological boost at a time of continued concern about theoutlook for an economic recovery. Investors &quot;were looking fora reflection of lower rates in the form of a prime rate cut,&quot;said John Conlon, managing director at Rothschild Inc.   The rally was diverse: Growth stocks in the drug andbeverage groups gained, but so did cyclical shares, such asauto, bank, insurance and aluminum stocks.   &quot;I think it is an impressive session, particularly in theface of the earnings outlook for Apple Computer and Kodak,&quot;Mr. Conlon said. Traders watched in awe as Apple fellyesterday, finishing down 7 3/4 points to 47 1/4 on 16.6million shares. The maker of personal computers said itexpected gross margins to decrease, and sparked a round ofearnings estimate reductions by analysts.   Eastman Kodak fell 7/8 to 40 3/4 on 1.4 million sharesafter reporting first-quarter earnings of 55 cents a sharecompared with 61 cents a year ago.   Mr. Conlon said the Dow industrials can make another runat the 3000 mark, but earnings disappointments should cap theaverage at that level.   Charles Comer, director of research at Credit LyonnaisSecurities, said his firm calculates that first-quartercorporate profits fell 15% to 18%, and could very well end uplower for the year compared with last year.   &quot;Everyone was looking for a rebound by late spring, andthen late summer,&quot; said Mr. Comer. But now, marketprofessionals aren't so sure when the recession will end.Yesterday's report by the National Association of PurchasingManagers indicated that the recession was in full swing inApril, even though the rate of economic decline had slowed.   Among interest rate-sensitive stocks, Federal NationalMortgage Association rose 1 1/2 to 47, Federal Home LoanMortgage added 2 3/4 to 79 3/4 and Student Loan MarketingAssociation surged 2 to 53 7/8.   American Express surged 1 1/4 to 26 1/4.   Insurers, which have been pounded by the market recently,were also big gainers yesterday. Aetna rose 7/8 to 43 3/4 andKemper added 2 1/2 to 38 1/2. Travelers rose 1 3/4 to 24 1/4after posting a profit of 88 cents a share, up from 87 centsin the year-earlier quarter. The latest quarter's profit,which includes a tax credit of seven cents a share, was atthe high end of analysts' estimates.   Transamerica earned 71 cents a share in the latest firstquarter, down from 88 cents a year earlier. The latestquarter's profit was at the high end of analysts'expectations. The stock fell 1 1/8 to 34.   Waste Management added 1 1/2 to 40 1/2. Pressure on thewaste-disposal industry by environmentalists has actuallyhelped Waste Management's business because it hurts smallercompetitors more than the industry giant, this newspaperreported.   Paramount Communications rose 1 3/4 to 38 5/8 after namingNBC Entertainment Group's chairman, Brandon Tartikoff, ashead of its Paramount Pictures unit.   Precision Castparts fell 1 1/4 to 39 5/8. The companyreported profit of 55 cents a share in the latest quarter, upfrom 51 cents a year ago, but at the low end of analysts'estimates for the quarter.   Asset Investors added 1/4 to 12 5/8. The company reportedfirst-quarter profit of 57 cents a share, down from 59 centsa year earlier.   The industrial average was helped yesterday byInternational Business Machines, which rebounded 1 to 104after its recent steep slide. Many other technology stockswere losers on the day, however.   Hewlett-Packard dropped 1 3/4 to 49 3/8, Compaq Computerfell 5/8 to 48 7/8 and Motorola slid 1 to 63 3/4.   Grumman leapt 1 3/8 to 17 1/2. The defense contractorreported first-quarter profit of 65 cents a share, above the47 cents earned a year ago and higher than many analystsexpected.   Barnett Banks said it has begun reviewing information onSoutheast Banking in connection with a possible acquisitionof the company. Barnett rose 1/4 to 27, while SoutheastBanking gained 1/8 to 5 1/2.</TEXT></DOC>
