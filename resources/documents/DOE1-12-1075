The authors attempt to provide an effectivecomputer-oriented approach for performing system analysis, simulationmodelling and simulation programming. The authors also give a case study,in which problems pertinent to system structure, surge bunker capacityand equipment matching are discussed. The simulation model establishedby the authors in this paper serves for general-purpose application.4 refs., 2 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
