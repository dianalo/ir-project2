There will be no major increase in cost orprices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local governmentalagencies, or on geographical regions. It will not have a significant economicimpact on competitive employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of U.S. enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprisesin domestic or export markets. In addition, it will not have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, Pub. L. No. 96-534 (5 U.S.C. 601).<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Analysis</ITAG>Not required for this proposed rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact Statement</ITAG>This proposed regulation does not significantly affect the environment.Therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required under theNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended.<ITAG tagnum="84">Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</ITAG>The Special Research Grants Program is listed in the Catalog of FederalDomestic Assistance under No. 10.200. For reasons set forth in the FinalRule-related Notice to 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V (48 FR 29115, June 24,1983), this program is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background and Purpose</ITAG>Under the authority of section 2(c)(1) of the Act of August 4, 1965, asamended, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to make grants to carryout research to facilitate or expand promising breakthroughs in areas ofthe food and agricultural sciences of importance to the Nation to land-grantcolleges and universities, research foundations established by land-grantcolleges and universities, State agricultural experiment stations, andto all colleges and universities having a demonstrable capacity in foodand agricultural research. The administrative regulations governing grantprograms authorized by section 2(c)(1) are proposed to be changed as follows:<T3>Section 3400.4(a)(2).</T3> CSRS proposes to change the deadline datefrom date of receipt to date of postmark. This proposed change will giveapplicants greater certainty with respect to the timeliness of their proposals.<T3>Section 3400.4(c)(9).</T3> A substantial number of research proposalsinvolve participation by outside individuals or organizations which isnot described sufficiently in the proposal. We propose adding the sectionon collaborative arrangements to facilitate both the technical and administrativereview of the proposal by requiring the proposal to clearly identify theperformer of each task of the project, the commitment of the party concernedto perform the task, and the proposed recipient of the award. <T3>Section 3400.4(c)(12).</T3> This subsection is proposed to be revisedto prohibit the use of grant funds under this program for the renovationor refurbishment of research spaces; purchase or installation of fixedequipment in such spaces; or for the planning, repair, rehabilitation,acquisition, or construction of a building or facility as mandated by section1409 (a)(2) and (b)(1) of the Food Security Act of 1985 (7 U.S.C 450i).<T3>Section 3400.4(c)(13)(iii).</T3> CSRS proposes adding the section onlaboratory animal care to ensure that uniform care and treatment of laboratoryanimals is practiced in all research projects supported by USDA. <T3>Section 3400.10(a).</T3> We propose removing the paragraph that refersto the Federal Advisory Committee Act governing the establishment and operationof peer review groups because this requirement no longer applies to thisprogram (7 U.S.C. 450i). <T3>Section 3400.15(a).</T3> Several former peer panel members who haveevaluated grant proposals under the Special Research Grants Program havewritten to USDA progam officials stating that certain criteria used inthe evaluation process contain higher weight factors than their level ofimportance merit; consequently, they have suggested that the criteria becombined, revised, or given lower weight factors. By proposing to alterthe current weighting system, CSRS hopes to provide a more equitable methodof evaluating and ranking research proposals submitted under this program.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 3400</ITAG>Grant programs_agriculture, Grants administration.For the reasons set out in the preamble, Title 7, Chapter XXXIV, Part 3400of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed to be amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 3400_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
