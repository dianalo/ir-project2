The television news said Xiao Bin, 42, also was deprived of allpolitical rights for three years in a decision by a court in Dalian,northeast China.   Xiao, vice section chief in a rubber factory, was charged withspreading counterrevolutionary rumors after telling an ABCtelevision crew that 20,000 people were killed when the army firedon pro-democracy protesters and their supporters June 3-4.   During the interview with ABC, Xiao said Tiananmen Square wascovered with blood and that tanks had run over people.   China denied anyone was killed in Tiananmen Square. It says about200 civilians died when soldiers were forced to fire on rioters whoblocked their way as they entered Tiananmen Square. Chinese sourcesand Western diplomats have put the figure as high as 3,000 and saytroops fired randomly into crowds.   China Central Television apparently intercepted the uneditedvideo as ABC sent it by satellite to its New York headquarters.   China's state-run television broadcast the interview and urgedviewers to help find the man. Two women reported him within hours,and he was arrested June 11.   ABC said it was ``deeply distressed'' over the use of its tape,and it began covering the faces of students it interviewed.   Foreign travel agents today urged China to end martial law inBeijing, lower tour prices and mount a public relations campaignabroad if it wants to bring back tourists scared by the crackdown.   During a daylong meeting, many agents said China should invest inoverseas tour promotions, something it does not normally do.   ``They want people to come in _ they have to go outside,'' saidPeter Spreadborough of Silk Route Travel in Melbourne, Australia.``Our problem is destination credibility. We know it's safe, butuntil there is some sizeable effort from big guns in Chinesetourism, we're fighting an uphill battle.''   Ken Chang of Pacific Delight Tours in Hong Kong said his companylost hundreds of thousands of dollars on promotional material fornow-canceled China tours.   Since the military crackdown, tourism in China has nearly halted.When 16 foreigners arrived in the eastern province of Jiangxi today,local officials gave them a ceremony and welcomed them as the firstforeign visitors in two months, the official Xinhua News Agency said.   Earlier today, the Foreign Ministry denied China has suffered adiplomatic loss of face and said most nations support its toughmeasures to eliminate political dissent.   ``The fact is that there are only a few countries who areinterfering in China's internal affairs,'' ministry spokeswoman LiJinhua said at a weekly briefing. ``The majority of countries haveexpressed their understanding, sympathy and even support for us.''   Most Western governments have suspended high-level officialcontacts and taken other measures to protest the violence and massarrests of protesters. Some socialist and non-aligned countries,such as Hungary and Yugoslavia, have joined in criticizing China.   Li criticized France for sheltering two fugitives, studentactivist Wu'er Kaixi and political theorist Yan Jiaqi, who arewanted by Chinese police for instigating and organizing protests.   ``The fact that France allowed them to go to France and to openlycarry out activities there aimed at subverting the government of thePeople's Republic of China is a flagrant violation of internationallaw, and the norms governing international relations, and it is alsoa gross interference in China's internal affairs and a seriousviolation of China's sovereignty,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
