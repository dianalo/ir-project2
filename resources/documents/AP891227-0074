It probably shouldn't have come as too great ashock recently when the environmental group Greenpeace pronounced``the father of waters'' a ``soup of toxic chemicals.''...   Iowa's contribution to the pollution is varied, although thegreatest portion comes from agricultural pesticide runoff.Startling quantities are involved: It has been determined, forexample, that 112,000 pounds of the chemical Alachlor flows past atest site in Louisiana each year.   The Greenpeace report pointed a finger at specific industries,as well, claiming they are discharging ``metals, solvents,cancer-causing hydrocarbons,'' and assorted other toxins into theMississippi at Clinton, Muscatine and Riverdale. ...   Any smugness we middle Americans may have felt toward ourcountrymen in the sooty, grimy reaches of New York or Californiawith their debris-infested beaches is misplaced until we get towork cleaning up after ourselves.</TEXT><TEXT>   Dec. 25   The Omaha (Neb.) World-Herald on the Soviets and NATO:   After years of hating the NATO alliance and trying to weaken it,the Kremlin now apparently sees NATO as a way of keeping Germanyfrom attempting to capitalize on Soviet weakness.   American diplomats have pointed to the Warsaw Pact as astabilizing infuence as Eastern Europe undergoes what amounts to ademocratic revolution. Shevardnadze has made a similar pointregarding the American presence. The two Germanys are not likely togo wobbling off on a disturbing political or military course ifSoviet and American troops are still present in the heart of Europe.   Reducing those troops to more reasonable levels is now the workof the Soviet-American arms negotiators in Geneva. The job shouldbe easier because the Soviets finally admit that the Americans arein Europe to keep the peace, not to start another war.</TEXT><TEXT>   Dec. 26   The Sioux Falls (S.D.) Argus Leader:   Under the terms of his new contract, Kirby Puckett of theMinnesota Twins will make more in a month than President Bush willmake in a year.   The star outfielder will make more in a month than (SouthDakota) Gov. George Mickelson will for his entire four-year term.   At $9 million for three years, Puckett will average $250,000 amonth. And he isn't even the highest paid player in major leaguebaseball.   Lately, baseball players have been grabbing the spotlight. Theyhave been the beneficiaries of a spectacular, new boom in salaries.The players have shown that they can overpower team owners at thebargaining table, as well as on the field.   The new salary structure is almost sickening. It reflects askewed system of public values that has actually been in place fordecades. Don't blame the modern players for taking what they canget. That's how free enterprise works.   If you like, blame the owners, who publicly plead poverty, andthen get into multimillion-dollar bidding wars for mediocrepitchers and .225 hitters.   Mostly, though, blame those of us who are silly enough to keepgoing to games, keep watching them on television, keep readingabout them and otherwise keep caring.</TEXT><NOTE>End Editorial Rdp</NOTE></DOC>
