Insel and Walton T. Ruth of Stanford MedicalSchool, is included.andP;  If the program determines you're at risk for somereason, you can turn to the book--which covers everything from cardiovascularhealth to cancer to nutrition for further information.andM;Personal Health Appraisal goes a long way toward increasing your awareness ofpotentially risky activities.andP;  More important, it might motivate you to dosomething about them before it's too late.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
