What would Labor Day Weekend be without Mr. Lewis's exhortations for muscular dystrophy research? Guest celebrities on WWOR will include Tony Orlando reunited with Dawn. Mr. Lewis's coterie of celebrities will gather at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.    Sunday and Monday, Sept. 4-5. The gridiron season opens with a doubleheader on NBC: the Miami Dolphins vs. the Chicago Bears Sunday at 1 p.m., to be followed by five regional matches at 4 p.m. More games will be carried on Sunday at 1 p.m. on CBS. And ABC's &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; returns with the Washington Redskins vs. the New York Giants (sans Lawrence Taylor) on Monday at 9 p.m. Cable viewers can keep up with the action on HBO's weekly &quot;Inside the NFL,&quot; resuming on Thursday, Sept. 8, 11 p.m.-midnight (repeated on Fridays and Saturdays). All times EDT.    Tuesdays, Sept. 6-27, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on PBS (PBS air dates and times vary, so check local listings): &quot;The Brutal Craft: Pioneers of Surgery.&quot; Public TV's acclaimed &quot;NOVA&quot; science series presents an incisive, probing exploration of the surgeon's art.    Wednesday, Sept. 7, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;Firing Line.&quot; Who says TV doesn't cover the issues? The first of four dynamite two-hour debates -- this one over the resolution &quot;The Right Is Better Able to Deal With the Soviets Than the Left&quot; -- will pit &quot;Firing Line&quot; host William F. Buckley Jr., Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Henry Kissinger against Gary Hart, George McGovern, Patricia Schroeder and Paul Warnke. The second, on domestic issues, airs Oct. 9.    Thursday, Sept. 8, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on CBS: &quot;Open Admissions.&quot; Not too many one-act plays by unknown writers make it to Broadway, but this one, a portrait of a well-meaning but ineffectual city college teacher and her semi-literate but aspiring student, did. Not too many Broadway plays become TV movies, but this one, scripted by the playwright Shirley Lauro and starring Jane Alexander, Michael Beach, Dennis Farina and Estelle Parsons, did.    Friday, Sept. 9, 9-10:30 EDT, on PBS: &quot;And the Pursuit of Happiness.&quot; He may not be another Tocqueville, but the French director Louis Malle has made some remarkably sensitive film portraits of America. This one focuses on the diverse experiences of today's immigrants.    Saturday, Sept. 10, 10:30 a.m.-noon EDT, on PBS, &quot;Wrap Around the World.&quot; It's a new genre, the simultaneous global broadcast. In this form, it's the exclusive invention of video artist Naim June Pak. This one mixes musical performance, video graphics and sports from 10 countries in order to celebrate the 1988 Olympics.    Saturday, Sept. 10, 10 p.m.-midnight EDT, on NBC: The Miss America Pageant. Having survived a change of hosts (seven years ago) and the flap over Vanessa Williams, the nation's most famous beauty contest now embraces more change: the 51 contestants &quot;will have more input as to the way they present themselves visually and personally.&quot; Good news, I suppose, for baton twirlers with bad left profiles.    Sundays, Sept. 11-Jan. 29, 9-9:30 p.m. EDT, on Aandamp;E (repeated the following Saturdays at 6): &quot;Vanity Fair.&quot; Before there was Tom Wolfe, there was William Makepeace Thackeray, who lit his own bonfire of Victorian society's vanities. This BBC adaptation revels in every satiric twist and fateful plot turn.    Monday, Sept. 12, 9-10 p.m. EDT, PBS: &quot;Louis Rukeyser's 1988 Election Guide.&quot; The host of &quot;Wall Street Week&quot; will discuss the major issues of the election with advisers to Messrs. Bush and Dukakis, and possibly (if they accept the invitations) the candidates themselves.    Mondays, Sept. 12-Oct. 3, 10-11 p.m. on EDT, on PBS: &quot;Canada: True North.&quot; Admit it, fellow U.S. citizens; most of us need a painless way to correct our inveterate ignorance of life north of the border. Now we have it, in this lively and informative coproduction of WTVS/Detroit and the National Film Board of Canada.    Tuesday, Sept. 13, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on CBS: &quot;Roger Rabbit andamp; the Secrets of Toontown.&quot; Fans of the current feature film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; will relish this TV special showing the tricks and techniques of blending &quot;Toons&quot; with non-Toons (i.e. human actors). Elastic-eared Roger will preside, along with his alluring wife, Jessica, co-star Bob Hoskins, and such veterans of Toon/non-Toon productions as Mickey Mouse, Porky Pig, Dick Van Dyke and Gene Kelly.    Tuesday, Sept. 13, 10 p.m.-1:30 a.m. or later EDT (interrupted from 11-11:30), on ABC: &quot;The Koppel Report: A National Town Meeting on the Legalization of Drugs.&quot; Only recently have the arguments supporting legalization received a tolerant public hearing. Mr. Koppel will allow a dozen experts on both sides to battle it out, as well as take comments and questions from a New York City studio audience and from viewers nationwide. Sounds like the sort of show that should keep us awake. </TEXT></DOC>
