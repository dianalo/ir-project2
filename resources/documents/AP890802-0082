Beirut has been largelydemolished and hundreds of innocent people have been killed. Do youexpect anyone to celebrate anything?'' said Sheik Rashid, a SunniMoslem clergyman at the Dar al-Fatwa center.   Four of the casualties were in Christian east Beirut and twowere in the city's western Moslem sector, most of them from sniperfire, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity.   By police count, the 5-month-old confrontation between Gen.Michel Aoun's predominantly Christian soldiers and Syrian forces inLebanon has claimed 511 lives and wounded 2,168 people.   Syrian troops moved into Lebanon in 1976 under a peacekeepingmandate from the 22-nation Arab League to contain the civil warwhich broke out in April 1975.   The Syrians eventually were drawn into the strife, supportingthe Moslem side against the Christians.   Ferocious artillery duels betwen Aoun's gunners and the Syrianarmy inflicted severe damage on most of Beirut forcing 1.3 millionof its original 1.5 million population to desert the city and seekrefuge in safer areas.   Dar al-Fatwa, the highest Sunni Moslem religious authority,called off its traditional New Year reception today because of thecurrent round of violence.   Government offices, banks, and other businesses closed inBeirut's Moslem and Christian sectors to mark the Moslem New Year,1410.   The current confrontation broke out March 8, two days after Aounblockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south ofBeirut for depriving the ailing state treasury of about $100million annually in lost customs dues.   The Syrians and their Moslem militia allied forces retaliated byshelling and besieging the 310-square-mile Christian enclavenortheast of Beirut.   A three-member Arab League foreign ministers' mediationcommittee said Tuesday it has reached an ``impasse'' for which itblamed Syria.</TEXT></DOC>
