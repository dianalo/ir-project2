The justices, by an 8-1 vote, turned down an emergency requestaimed at allowing display of the 18-foot menorah.   Justice Harry A. Blackmun was the lone vote to allow the display.   The court agreed in October to decide whether displaying themenorah at the City-County Building and a Christmas nativity sceneat a nearby government building violate the constitutionallyrequired separation of church and state.   That decision is expected by July.   But lawyers for Chabad, the Jewish organization that owns themenorah, asked the justices to set aside a federal appeals court'sorder that bars its display pending the high court's review.   The menorah had been displayed each year since 1982.   The nativity scene depicting the birth of Jesus Christ has beendisplayed inside the main entrance of the Allegheny CountyCourthouse for about six weeks during the Christmas season since1981.   A federal trial judge refused to order the dismantling of thedisplays when they were challenged last Christmas. But the 3rd U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, by a 2-1 vote, that the displaysunlawfully promote religion.   The nativity scene, or creche, is owned by the Holy Name Society,a Roman Catholic men's group. It has not sought emergency actionthat would allow display of the creche during the Christmas seasonthis year.   The Supreme Court in 1984 allowed communities nationwide toinclude nativity scenes and other religious symbols in officiallysponsored holiday displays.   In that ruling, the justices let Pawtucket, R.I., officials placea creche in a Christmas display because such decorations as SantaClaus, reindeer and snowmen also were included.   But lower courts since have treated the 1984 decision as a narrowone, and have disallowed various government-sponsored Christmasdisplays deemed too religious.   The case is Chabad vs. ACLU, A-384.</TEXT></DOC>
