This change is necessary to ensure that the Servicewill be given sufficient information necessary to identify the alien whois the subject of a motion for a judicial recommendation against deportation.This change will permit the Service sufficient time to obtain any filerelating to the alien and to prepare a response, if desired, to the alien'smotion for a judicial recommendation against deportation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received by no later than February 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Submit written comments, in triplicate, to Director,Policy Directives and Instructions, Immigration and Naturalization Service,Room 2011, 425 I Street NW., Washington, DC 20536.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Ira L. Frank, Senior Special Agent,Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street NW., Room 7240, Washington,DC 20536, Telephone: (202) 633-3098.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>This proposed rule will place the burdenon the alien or his criminal defense counsel to provide the district directorreceiving notice of the motion with a copy of any order granting a judicialrecommendation against deportation, certified as a true copy by the clerkof the court granting said motion. In deportation, exclusion, or rescissionproceedings, the burden will be upon the alien to present to an immigrationjudge a certified copy of the judicial recommendation against deportationwhen such recommendation will be the basis of denying any charges broughtby the Service in proceedings against the alien. This change is necessaryto ensure that the granting of a judicial recommendation against deportationis known to the Service and/or the immigration judge to avoid conductingunnecessary hearings. Clearly, the alien is in a better position than theService to identify if the motion was granted by the sentencing court inhis/her particular case, considering the countless number of such motionsmade by criminal alien defendants in any given year. This proposed rulewill cause judicial recommendations that are granted subsequent to thisrule becoming final to be negated if the data required by this rule isnot substantially provided.In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner certifies that thisrule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. This is not a major rule within the meaning of section1(b) of E.O. 12291, nor does this rule have federalism implications warrantingthe preparation of a Federal Assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612.The information collection requirements contained in this rule have beensubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget for clearance under theprovisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 8 CFR Part 241</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Deportation.Accordingly, Chapter I Part 241, of Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulationsis amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 241_JUDICIAL RECOMMENDATIONS AGAINST DEPORTATION; CONTROLLEDSUBSTANCE VIOLATIONS</ITAG>1.The authority citation for Part 241 continues to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>8 U.S.C. 1103, 1251, 1252, 1357.</ITAG>2. Section 241.1 is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 24.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Notice; recommendation.</ITAG>(a) For the purpose of clause 2 of section 241(b) of the Act, notice tothe district director having administrative jurisdiction over the placein which the court imposing sentence is located shall be regarded as noticeto the Service. The notice shall be transmitted by personal service tothe district director by the defendant or by counsel for the defense, atleast 15 days prior to the court hearing on whether a recommendation againstdeportation shall be made. When less than 15 days' notice is received anobjection shall be interposed to the recommendation against deportationon the ground that due notice was not received. Failure to furnish duenotice for any reason, including the foregoing, negates any judicial recommendationagainst deportation which may have been granted. (b) The notice to the district director will include the true and completename of the defendant and the aliases by which he or she has been knownor has himself or herself used. Notice will also include the country ofwhich defendant is a citizen, his or her date and place of birth, alienregistration number(s), if any, and the date, place and manner by whichhe or she last entered the United States. If the information required onthe notice is unavailable and cannot be reasonably discovered, a declarationunder the penalty of perjury shall be attached to the notice stating theparticular information that is unavailable, the reason it is unavailableand what steps have been taken to obtain the required information. Thenotice shall be accompanied by either a copy of defendant's alien registration,if any, or a declaration under the penalty of perjury that no such registrationexists. The forms listed in 8 CFR 264.1(b) shall constitute evidence ofregistration. If the notice fails to include substantially the informationrequired above, then the notice shall be regarded as invalid and whateverService proceedings are warranted shall be instituted irrespective of therecommendation against deportation. (c) The district director, or an official acting for him or her, in presentingrepresentations to the court, shall advise the court the effect a favorablerecommendation would have upon the alien's present and prospective deportability.(d) It shall be the duty of the defendant or defense counsel, to forwardby personal service, a copy of the recommendation certified by the clerkof the court granting said recommendation to the district director receivingthe notice.
