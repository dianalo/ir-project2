Monday announced its 4 and 16Megabit-per-second (Mb/s) Token Ring module options for the System 3000intelligent wiring hub.andM;Its new &quot;active hub&quot; approach allows use of ordinary unshielded twisted pairtelephone wire for high-speed data tranmission over longer lengths of cablethan has previously been possible.andM;Additional new technology developed by SynOptics significantly increases thelogistical number of stations that can be configured in a single Token Ringnetwork.andP;  Traditionally, the maximum ring count for unshielded twisted pairToken Ring has been limited to 72 nodes.andM;Raising the available station count represents tremendous cost savings byreducing the number of bridges that would be required to build largerphysical rings.andP;  Further, the addition of a new fiber optic repeater modulewill extend trunk ring interconnections between concentrators to up to twokilometers.andM;SynOptics is best known for its 1987 breakthrough technology that runs thepopular Ethernet networking access method over unshielded twisted pair at 10Mb/s.andM;This expertise has led to a dual strategy:  a passive approach for use withshielded twisted pair and high performance LAN cables such as those from ATandamp;Tand Northern Telecom, and a new active hub approach which achieves standardbuilding cabling distance requirements using ordinary telephone wire,commonly called D Inside Wire or DIW.andM;Through these two approaches, SynOptics has achieved a 16 Mb/s unshieldedtwisted pair Token Ring solution that meets standard building cablingspecifications of 330 feet (100 meter) cabling runs between the workstationand the wiring closet, allows rings of up to 144 devices to be built withoutbridging and, through the active hub approach, runs over the ordinaryunshielded twisted pair telephone wire already installed in most buildings.andM;SynOptics has done extensive testing of both the active and passiveapproaches in it's labs, using everything from DIW to high performance supercable, and believes it has a very high quality solution for customers whowant to build 16 Mb/s Token Ring networks based on unshielded twisted pair.andM;The LattisNet Model 3502A STP/UTP Token Ring Host Module, an enhancement tothe Model 3502 that was announced last March, uses the passive approach for 4Mb/s UTP installations of DIW, 4 or 16 Mb/s installations usinghigh-performance cable as well as 4 or 16 Mb/s installations using shieldedtwisted pair.andM;The LattisNet Model 3505 Token Ring UTP Host Module is intended for siteswhere ordinary DIW is installed and operation at 16 Mb/s is required.andP;  Thisoption uses SynOptic's active hub approach, employing both an equalizer and afilter on each channel of the host module to reduce cross talk introduced athigher data rates.andM;This approach allows distances of 330 feet (100 meters) over ordinary DIW.andO;Even longer distances are achieved with the Model 3505 using high performancecable:  up to 600 feet (180 meters) at 16 Mb/s and up to 1000 feet (300meters) at 4 Mb/s.andM;Token Ring host modules can share the same concentrator with Ethernet hostmodules for unshielded twisted pair, shielded twisted pair and fiber opticcable as well as the LattisNet local and remote bridge modules.andP;  The uniquebackplane design of the System 3000 concentrator chassis allows both Ethernetand Token Ring to operate together in the same wiring enclosure.andM;The Model 550 UTP Lobe Media Filter connects directly to the networkinterface card on a Token Ring station to limit RF emissions on theunshielded twisted pair cable at both 4 and 16 Mb/s data rates.andM;The Model 551 Repeater Media Filter connects an external IBM Repeater (Model8218 or 8220) to a LattisNet Model 3552 Ring-In/Ring-Out Module (alsoannounced last March) and concentrator populated with Model 3502A STP/UTPHost Modules supporting UTP lobes.andM;The Repeater Media Filter limits RF emissions on the UTP lobes by filteringthe output of the IBM repeaters.andP;  A series of low cross talk patch cables arealso available to connect between the host module and the wiring closet patchpanel or punch down block, and between the Token Ring adapter card and thewall outlet.andM;To build enterprise-wide Token Rings, the LattisNet Model 3534-ST Token RingFiber Optic Repeater Module increases allowable trunk cable distances betweenconcentrators by up to 2 km.andP;  Availability of the fiber optic repeater moduleis dependent upon completion of successful field tests which are currentlyunderway.andM;Shipments of LattisNet UTP Token Ring host modules will begin within 45 daysthrough SynOptics' authorized resellers worldwide.andM;Using a sample configuration of 144 stations (lobes), LattisNet Token Ring ispriced at about $235 per lobe using the passive approach (Model 3502A) andabout $300 per lobe using the active approach (Model 3505).andM;Key Executives: Don Miller, director of marketing for SynOptics.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
