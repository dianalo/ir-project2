PUTNAM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Palestinian leaders denounced on Sunday newproposals reportedly planned by the Bush administration for easingtension in the Israeli-occupied territories.   The Palestinians, attending a Mideast peace symposium in NewYork, called on the administration to push instead for a permanentsolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, including creation of anindependent Palestinian state.   Several left-wing Israeli legislators attending the three-daysymposium, which began Saturday, also predicted that the U.S.initiatives described in a published report Sunday would fail ifthey included only interim measures for quelling the Palestinianuprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   The New York Times reported in its Sunday editions that the Bushadministration plans to propose that both Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization take steps to ease tension in theIsraeli-occupied territories.   U.S. officials plan to ask Israel to release some of thePalestinians arrested during the 15-month uprising, end or limitdetentions and reopen schools in the territories, the newspapersaid, quoting an unidentified senior administration official.   The U.S. initiatives also would call on the PLO to halt violentdemonstrations in the Israeli-occupied territories, blockanti-Israeli raids from southern Lebanon and stop distribution ofinflammatory leaflets, the newspaper said.   ``These demands are unbalanced, unfair,'' said Faisal Husseini,director of the Arab Studies Center in East Jerusalem and a topPalestinian leader in the occupied territories.   He said the new U.S. proposals were flawed because ``they areasking us to stop the demonstrations,'' while Israel was being asked``the minimum.''   Husseini and PLO officials at the symposium said the real issueis ending Israel's occupation of the territories, captured fromJordan and Egypt during the 1967 Middle East war, and creating aPalestinian state.   ``The intefadeh (the Arabic name for the uprising) is our onlyweapon for continuing the peace plan,'' said Nabil Shaath, chairmanof the Political Committee of the Palestine National Council, thePLO's legislative arm. ``What is not negotiable is the final result:an independent Palestinian state side-by-side with the state ofIsrael.''   Afif Safieh, the PLO representative in the Netherlands, said thereported new U.S. proposals were aimed at the wrong target.   ``The target should not be how to decrease the level of tensions,but how to practice, manage and plan the solution to the conflict,''he said.   Yossi Sarid, a member of the left-wing Citizens Rights Movementin Israel's Knesset, or parliament, said the Bush proposals ``showat least that the new administration has a sense of urgency'' aboutrestarting the Mideast peace process.   But he said if the administration plans only ``an interimagreement,'' without addressing the final status between Israel andthe PLO, the proposals will fail.   Yair Tzaban, a Knesset member from the Socialist Mapam party,said the proposals were incomplete.   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat ``is like the man riding a bicycle,''he said. ``He can go either forward or backward, but he cannot standstill because he will fall down. So we must push the peace processforward.''   The new Bush proposals will be presented Monday when IsraeliForeign Minister Moshe Arens meets with the president, the Timesreported, while the suggestions for the PLO will be presentedthrough the American ambassador in Tunis, Robert Pelletreau Jr.   The three-day symposium at Columbia University is the first to besponsored by Israelis and Palestinians in cooperation with U.S. Jewsand Arabs.</TEXT></DOC>
