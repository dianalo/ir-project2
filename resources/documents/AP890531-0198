The Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corp., whichdescribed the cracks in a memo to lawmakers last week as ``quitesevere,'' said repairs have been completed and apparently would notimpact on the Sept. 30 commissioning date of the USS Topeka, aSSN-688 Los Angeles class attack submarine.   Electric Boat spokesman Neil Ruenzel said metallurgical testsconducted by the Groton, Conn., sub maker showed that the steelplate in question developed a defect during the manufacturingprocess.   The steel maker, Armco Inc. of Parsippany, N.J., initiatedrepairs, but ``did not completely eliminate the defect in thisplate when they made the repair,'' Electric Boat said in astatement.   ``The cracks were present prior to or during heat treatmentfollowing the repair. While it is not uncommon for a vendor tocorrect defects in steel plate used in submarine construction, itis rare that cracks remain after this repair,'' Electric Boat said.The cracks were on the area that had undergone repairs, Ruenzelsaid.   Jim Herzog, a spokesman for Armco, said the steel maker wouldwithhold comment until it receives Electric Boat's report on thefindings. That report had not been received by the end of businessWednesday, he said.   The steel plate was manufacturered by Armco's Houston plant anddelivered in 1984, Herzog said. The Electric Boat order was amongthe last for the Houston plant before it was shut down, he said.   Ruenzel, when asked how the cracks could have gone undetected bycompany and Navy inspectors for five years, said, ``It could havegotten bigger over time. I think that's the best explanation.''   Navy and company officials refused to describe the cracks,saying the information was classified. But The Hartford Courantreported that one was a 2-inch long hairline crack and the otherwas smaller.   The cracks were discovered by a foreman during preparation forpainting the hull at the Groton shipyard.   Ruenzel said it was not immediately known how much the repairscost Electric Boat. The question of liability would be addressed inthe future, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
