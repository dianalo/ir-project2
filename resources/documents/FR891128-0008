Summary of Today's Action</ITAG>Today, EPA is taking final action on an October 26, 1984 rulemaking proposal(49 FR 43211) to ``list'' fugitive emissions from SCM's and on relatedfugitive dust emissions issues. The ``list'' referred to, found at 40 CFR51.166(b)(1)(iii) and 52.21(b)(1)(iii), is of those stationary source categoriesfor which fugitive emissions are included in determining whether a prospectivenew source or modification is ``major.'' New major stationary sources andmajor modifications to existing major stationary sources are required toobtain major source NSR permits. The EPA is also taking final action toresolve issues concerning the review of fugitive emissions from SCM's whichare not specifically listed but which are subject to review under certainlimited circumstances.In this notice, EPA announces its conclusion that SCM's should not be addedto the list of sources for which fugitive emissions are considered in TAD'sfor major source NSR (including PSD) permits. The EPA notes that the extensiveauthorities and regulations administered by the Department of the Interior(DOI) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) andthe Federal Coal Management Program (FCMP) adequately address the potentialair quality problems in natural resource areas of special concern thata decision to list SCM's affecting these areas would seek to address. AlthoughEPA has considered the effect of DOI authorities in deciding not to listSCM's, EPA is not granting preemptory authority to DOI for the controlof air pollution from SCM's. The Act still requires State implementationplans (SIP's) to contain emission limitations, permit programs, and othermeasures to ensure that ambient standards and PSD increments are attainedand maintained and that there is no manmade visibility impairment in anymandatory Federal Class I area (see sections 110, 161, 169A, and 172 ofthe Act).Today's notice that EPA will not list SCM's does not preclude EPA fromreconsidering listing SCM's at a later date, if sufficient evidence isprovided to EPA of a threat of reduced visibility or other adverse airquality impacts in national parks, wilderness areas, national memorialparks, and international parks that are Class I PSD areas. Such evidenceshould also show that DOI authorities will not protect visiblity and otherair quality values within these areas.The EPA also announces that it is maintaining the status quo regardinginclusion of fugitive emissions from SCM's where SCM's are collocated withlisted sources or otherwise presently subject to NSR regulations. The EPAbelieves that emissions from SCM's will be subject to review in this fashiononly in limited circumstances, if at all, since SCM's themselves are notlisted. The EPA is also retaining the interpretation that the definitionof major source in section 302(j) of the Act does not extend to modificationsand would therefore not affect SCM's collocated with an existing majorsource undergoing modification.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background</ITAG>This section briefly summarizes the events leading to today's action butdoes not repeat in detail previous discussions already published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>. The reader is referred to these previous notices,specifically August 25, 1983 (48 FR 38742), October 26, 1984 (49 FR 43202and 43211), and February 28, 1986 (51 FR 7090), for a more detailed discussion.A. <T3>The PSD and NSR Applicability Determinations and Fugitive Emissions_</T3>1.<T3>Scope of Applicability.</T3> The review and permitting requirementsof PSD provisions in Part C of the Act apply to ``major'' new stationarysources and major modifications to existing major sources. Similar NSRrequirements under Part D of the Act apply to major sources locating indesignated ``nonattainment'' areas. The EPA and State permitting authoritiesconduct emissions assessments to determine whether a source is major andtherefore subject to the PSD and NSR requirements of Parts C and D of theAct. The EPA refers to these assessments as TAD's. Section 302(j) of theAct, 42 U.S.C. 7602(j), defines both ``major stationary source'' and ``majoremitting facility'' as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Any stationary facility or source of air pollutants which directlyemits, or has the potential to emit, one hundred tons per year or moreof any air pollutant (including any major emitting facility or source offugitive emissions of any such pollutant, as determined by rule by theAdministrator).\1\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ For PSD purposes, section 169(l) effectively modifiessection 302(j) by establishing the threshold amount of emissions as 100tons per year for certain designated source categories and 250 tons peryear for sources in other categories.The EPA regulations define ``fugitive emissions'' as emissions that couldnot reasonably pass through a stack or other functionally equivalent opening.(See 40 CFR 52.21(b)(20).)2. <T3>Importance of Fugitive Emissions.</T3> Sources in many types of industrialcategories exceed major source thresholds solely by virtue of their stackemissions. Other source categories, however, such as SCM's, have relativelyfew stack emissions. Since a source could be major if fugitive emissionsare included in TAD's, but nonmajor if fugitive emissions are not included,treatment of fugitive emissions for applicability purposes can be important.A determination that a source is or will be ``major'' subjects a projectto all PSD or nonattainment permit requirements and/or a construction banunder section 110(a)(2)(I) of the Act.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ A threshold applicability determination is distinct froma pollutant applicability determination, which is a determination of whichpollutant streams from a ``major'' source or ``major'' modification aresubject to the substantive requirements of the regulations in question.The PSD requirements, for instance, apply to each regulated pollutant thata ``major'' source emits in ``significant'' amounts, e.g., 40 CFR 52.21(j)(1984).The regulations do not distinguish between stack and fugitive emissionsfor this purpose. Construction ban regulations are codified at 40 CFR 52.24.3. <T3>Mines, Strip Mines, and SCM's.</T3> The terms ``mine,'' ``strip mines,''and ``SCM's'' are used in this notice to refer to mining operations. Today'saction is limited to SCM's, which were proposed for listing in October1984 (49 FR 43211). The terms mines and strip mines are more general butinclude SCM's. Strip mining may refer to open surface operations for miningcoal and other materials. Mines may refer to all mines, including undergroundmaterial extraction. Although today's action focuses on SCM's, commentsand discussion may refer to issues applicable to other mines. For example,some DOI regulations pertain to all mining activities, above and belowground.B. <T3>Regulatory Basis</T3>_1. <T3>Clean Air Act Section 302(j).</T3> Following enactment of the Act Amendmentsof 1977, which added part C and Part D, EPA issued in 1978 and 1979 variousregulations and guidelines under 40 CFR parts 51 and 52 to implement thesenew provisions. In each action, EPA assumed without discussion that thefugitive emissions of a source or modification were to be included in quantifyingits emissions rate in order to determine whether it is ``major'' (see,e.g., 43 FR 26382-83, 26403-04 (June 19, 1978)). The EPA regarded the PartC definition of ``major emitting facility'' as exclusively governing themeaning of that term for PSD purposes. Since that definition does not distinguishbetween fugitive and nonfugitive emissions, EPA concluded that fugitiveemissions are as eligible for inclusion in the threshold determinationsof PSD applicability as nonfugitive emissions.One of the consequences of this assumption was that sources of predominantlyfugitive emissions, such as SCM's, could be ``major'' and, hence, subjectto PSD and NSR permitting requirements or the construction ban.2. <T3>Alabama Power </T3>v.<T3> Costle.</T3> In December 1979, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Districtof Columbia Circuit held that EPA's interpretation of ``major emittingfacility'' in Part C was incorrect, and, thus, EPA may require the inclusionof fugitive emissions in TAD's for projects in a particular category onlyif it first satisfied the rulemaking requirement of section 302(j) as tothat category (<T3>Alabama Power Company</T3> v. <T3>Costle</T3>, 636 F.2d 323, 369). The court did not specify what itthought EPA had to consider in such a rulemaking. It did say, however,that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The EPA's regulation of fugitive emissions has been of special concernto the mining and forestry industries which contend, without serious opposition,that they are incapable of meeting the strict limitations on the emissionof particulate matter set by the PSD provisions. * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The legislative history of this rulemaking provision [Section 302(j)]is sparse, but it may well define a legislative response to the policyconsiderations presented by the regulation of sources where the predominantemissions are fugitive in origin, particularly fugitive dust. Whateverthe motivation of the ``rule'' provision of 302(j), its existence is unmistakable.Even if the origin of this provision is fortuitous, the provision may wellbe welcomed as serendipitous, for it gives EPA flexibility to provide industry-by-industryconsideration and appropriate tailoring of coverage. [id.]</ITAG>3. <T3>August 7, 1980 Rulemaking. </T3>In response to the U.S. Court of Appealsfor the District of Columbia Circuit ruling in <T3>Alabama Power Company </T3>v. <T3>Costle</T3>, EPA proposed amendments to both the PSD and nonattainmentregulations that would comply with the rulemaking requirements of section302(j) by excluding fugitive emissions from TAD's except as to certainspecifically listed categories of sources (e.g., 44 FR 51924, 51948 (September5, 1979)). Most listed categories corresponded generally to those in thePart C definition of ``major emitting facility;'' the remaining categoriesencompassed any source subject on August 7, 1980 to an emission standardunder either section 111 or 112 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7411 or 7412. [TheSCM's were not among the listed categories (id. at 51931)]. The EPA explainedthat it was proposing to require the inclusion of fugitive emissions forthe listed categories because (1) emissions from sources in those categoriesdeteriorate air quality regardless of how they emanate, and (2) the Agency'sexperience in quantifying fugitive emissions from such sources was in generalgreater than its experience in quantifying fugitive emissions from othersources (id).Numerous issues were raised in the course of proposal. In response, EPAmaintained its initial interpretation of section 302(j) as reflected inthe September 1979 proposal and concluded that the rulemaking it was conductinghad afforded sources the opportunity to comment on the proposed inclusionof fugitive emissions in threshold calculations (id. at 52961). Hence,in August 1980, EPA promulgated the substance of the amendments it hadproposed (e.g., 45 FR 52739).\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The EPA simultaneously promulgated a wide array of otherchanges to the various new source review regulations in effect at the time;not only the Part 51 and 52 PSD regulations, the Offset ruling, and theconstruction ban, but also 40 CFR 51.165(a), which set forth the requirementsof the Part D permit program and which EPA had first promulgated in May1980 (45 FR 31307).<ITAG tagnum="28">The EPA did not include SCM's on the list of categories, althoughthe Sierra Club in its comments had argued for their inclusion.</ITAG>4. <T3>Chemical Manufacturer's Association </T3>v. <T3>EPA and Settlement Agreement. </T3>In late 1980, the American MiningCongress (AMC) and other industry organizations (collectively, the ``industrypetitioners'') petitioned the D.C. Circuit to review the provisions thatrequire the fugitive emissions of projects in the listed categories tobe taken into account in TAD's. These challenges were subsequently consolidatedinto <T3>Chemical Manufacturer's Association</T3> v. <T3>EPA</T3>, No. 79-1112 (D.C. Circuit) (<T3>CMA</T3>).The industry petitioners argued that EPA, before it established those provisions,should have considered the problems of measuring, modeling, and controllingfugitive emissions that are peculiar to each category and then provided(in the words of the <T3>Alabama Power</T3> opinion) ``appropriate tailoring of coverage.''They also contended that the Act required the EPA to consider, on an industry-by-industrybasis, the social, economic, health, and welfare impacts of including fugitiveemissions in TAD's. They suggested that EPA could decline to require theinclusion of fugitive emissions as to a particular category on the groundsthat growth in that industry was important to the economy and that theemissions posed low risks to human health and welfare. Finally, the industrypetitioners asserted that EPA entirely failed to meet those requirementsof the Act [Petitioners Brief on Fugitive Emissions and Certain Other Issues,at 12-19 (February 11, 1981)]. In June 1981, EPA began negotiations withthe industry petitioners to settle the issues relating to fugitive emissionsin the <T3>CMA</T3> case. In February 1982, EPA entered into a settlement agreementwith these petitioners in which it agreed to propose to delete the requirementfor including fugitive emissions and to take final action on that proposal.Subsequently, the court granted a stay of the case pending implementationof the agreement. The EPA proposed the change called for in this portionof the agreement on August 25, 1983 (48 FR 38742).5. <T3>Sierra Club </T3>v. <T3>Gorsuch</T3>. In addition to challenges by various industry representatives,the Sierra Club and other environmental groups petitioned the D.C. Circuitto review the 1980 regulations, including the provisions relating to fugitiveemissions. In response to industry contention that EPA, in requiring theinclusion of fugitive emissions for the listed categories, had failed toconduct the rulemaking the court had contemplated, the Sierra Club counteredthat EPA, in failing to list SCM's, had acted arbitrarily and capriciously.The court consolidated the industry challenges under <T3>CMA</T3> v. <T3>EPA</T3> (No. 79-1112), and kept the Sierra Club challenge on its owntrack.On August 26, 1983, in response to the Sierra Club petition, the D.C. Circuitruled that under the logic of its 1980 action, EPA appeared to have nogood reason for listing categories without including SCM's (715 F.2d 653).The court subsequently ordered EPA to propose to list or not list SCM's.6. <T3>October 26, 1984_The ``Safety Valve.'' </T3>In the October 26, 1984<T4>Federal Register</T4>, EPA completed its obligations regarding SCM'sunder the <T3>CMA </T3>settlement agreement by deciding not to promulgate the fundamentalchanges proposed in August 1983. The EPA instead determined that its initial1980 interpretation regarding the nature of the section 302(j) rulemakingrequirement was correct (49 FR 43202). On the same day, EPA fulfilled itsobligation under <T3>Sierra Club </T3>v. <T3>Gorsuch</T3> by proposing to list SCM's (49 FR 43211). The EPA characterizedcongressional intent as requiring EPA to make only two determinations beforerequiring fugitive emissions to be included in TAD's. For sources in aparticular category, EPA must show that: (1) The sources have the potentialto degrade air quality significantly, and (2) no unreasonable socioeconomicimpacts relative to the benefits would result from subjecting the sourcesto the relevant PSD or nonattainment programs. Thus, a finding that thesources in a category pose a threat of significant air quality degradationis enough to propose listing, though EPA must consider broader-based objectionsraised by commenters during the rulemaking before taking final action.The interpretation of section 302(j) that EPA espoused in 1980 and essentiallyreaffirmed in 1984 reasonably responds to different congressional intents.A determination by EPA that the sources in a category pose a threat ofsignificant air quality degradation, in effect, establishes a presumptionthat the sources should be subject to PSD and nonattainment review. Thisis because the primary purpose of that review is to prevent the constructionof new projects that would interfere materially with timely attainmentand maintenance of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) andPSD increments. Commenters then may seek to rebut this presumption by producinga record that unreasonable social or economic costs relative to the anticipatedbenefits would occur if PSD or nonattainment review were applied to a particularcategory of sources. The EPA's role is to resolve any clash of views and,therefore, engage in a deliberative process that can go far beyond thevirtually ministerial decision making that some environmental groups advocate.However, the decision-making process need be extensive only if there arelegitimate cost-benefit concerns. Under this interpretation, section 302(j)functions as a useful ``safety valve,'' while at the same time minimizingthe expenditure of EPA resources. The EPA's position and reasoning is discussedin further detail in <T4>Federal Register</T4> notices published on October 26, 1984 (49 FR43202) and February 28, 1986 (51 FR 7090.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Both industry and environmental groups petitioned forjudicial review of EPA's October 1984 final action setting the criteriafor rulemaking under section 302(j). Those cases were consolidated as <T3>National Coal Association (NCA) v. EPA, </T3>No. 84-1609 (D.C. Cir.),and are still pending as of this date.The October 26, 1984 proposal also reopened the public comment period onthe existing list of source categories for which fugitive emissions areincluded in determining major source status. Further, the notice solicitedcomment on an interpretive ruling involving section 302(j) of the Act inrelation to the review of modifications involving fugitive emissions atsources that are already ``major.''7. <T3>AMC Administrative Petition (1984). </T3>Additional petitions for administrativereconsideration of EPA's October 1984 final action were filed by the AMC,Peabody Holding Co., Inc., and the <T3>NCA </T3>(collectively, ``AMC''). The petitions expressed several concernsrelated to the prospect that SCM's could be subjected to PSD and NSR evenif EPA made a final determination not to list SCM's as such. The industryconcerns included the interaction between the definition of ``source''for PSD and NSR purposes and the currently listed fugitive emissions sourcecategories, and the applicability of section 302(j) to major modifications.To the extent that SCM's would be indirectly subject to PSD and NSR, mininginterests sought regulatory relief, either through a change in the definitionof source, or through deletion of certain currently listed fugitive emissionssource categories. By letter dated June 28, 1985, EPA granted the AMC petitionand stated that EPA would complete its reconsideration, and dispose ofthe other petitions, in conjunction with its final action on the listingof SCM's. The EPA's disposition of these petitions is set forth later inthis notice.8. <T3>February 28, 1986_Alternatives Proposed for Listing SCM's. </T3>OnFebruary 28, 1986 (51 FR 7090), the EPA reopened the public comment periodto solicit comments on four possible regulatory alternatives for fugitiveemissions from SCM's. Alternative I maintained the status quo (no listingof SCM's). Alternative II would list all new SCM's but ``grandfather''(i.e., not count) increment consumption for existing mines.\5\<NOTE/> Alternative III would list all new SCM's and not grandfatherincrement consumption for existing mines. Alternative IV would list onlySCM's impacting Class I and mandatory Class II areas.\6\<NOTE/> The EPA also proposed to list SCM's unless public commentaffirmatively demonstrated that unreasonable socioeconomic impacts wouldresult.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Increments published in 40 CFR 52.21(c) are the allowablemaximum increase in pollutant concentrations over baseline concentrations_ambientlevels that existed in an area on the baseline date after August 7, 1977as defined under 40 CFR 52.21(b) (13 through (15).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Protected areas created after August 7, 1977 (larger than10,000 acres) are ``mandatory Class II areas'' and would have been designatedClass I if they had been established as of August 7, 1977. These areascan only be reclassified as Class I or remain Class II but cannot be reclassifiedto Class III. [40 CFR 52.21(e)].The notice announced that the public comment period with respect to theexisting list of source categories and to the relevance of section 302(j)to review of modifications was closed and was not reopened. However, EPAsolicited any additional comments on the SCM proposal, the regulatory impactanalysis (RIA) of the possible alternatives, and other generic fugitiveemissions issues not specifically foreclosed. The EPA noted that otherprograms, notably the one operated by the DOI pursuant to the SMCRA, 30U.S.C. 1201 et seq., could address similar problems. The EPA sought commenton the effectiveness of such programs in protecting Class I and mandatoryClass II areas and requested an analysis of this issue from DOI.All comments were placed in the official rulemaking docket [Docket No.A-84-33] and made available for inspection and copying at the EPA officesin Washington, DC. The comment period was extended twice, closing on June30, 1986.9. <T3>The RIA.</T3> The EPA prepared an RIA for the proposed SCM rulemakingalternatives, in part, to comply with Executive Order 12291, which providesthat major rulemakings consider economic consequences. The EPA has broaddiscretion in its use of the study, however, since the Act requires manyother factors to be considered in this rulemaking. The EPA Administratorrelies on the entire rulemaking record in making a final decision.The RIA evaluated the projected consequences of the proposed alternativesto regulating new and modified SCM's as major sources under PSD and NSR.It considered benefits, costs, and general environmental and economic impacts.The effects of the four possible regulatory alternatives were consideredin the RIA by examining potential impacts at several SCM's typical in sizeand location for selected coal mining regions. Five important coal basinswere investigated to determine the impacts of Alternative II: Powder River,San Juan, Fort Union, Illinois, and Appalachian. Powder River also servedas a case study for Alternative III. Impacts of hypothetical mines on BryceCanyon National Park and Chaco Culture National Historic Park were reviewedrelative to Alternative IV. The analysis of costs and benefits for AlternativeIV in the RIA was conducted with an assumption that no other regulatoryprogram would protect Class I and mandatory Class II areas from SCM's.Benefits and costs in these areas were evaluated for the year 1995.\7\<NOTE/> The costs evaluated arise from application of best availablecontrol technology and, more importantly, from size limitations in SCM'sbecause of ambient constraints. Benefit categories include mortality, morbidity,and soiling for Alternatives II and III, and visibility for AlternativeIV. The study also examined national impacts involving coal price and production,and the cost of electricity.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ For Alternative IV, Chaco Culture National Historic Parkwas evaluated for 1989 and Bryce Canyon was evaluated for 1996.Costs estimated under Alternative II considerably exceed benefits for thefive basins analyzed in the RIA and were considered to be unreasonablerelative to the costs and benefits of other alternatives. Factors mostlyresponsible for these results include: the relatively low ambient particulatematter contribution from SCM's nationally and low background particulatematter concentrations around SCM's, the limited distance from SCM's thatambient impacts occur, and the general absence of populations exposed toSCM particulate matter.The Powder River Basin estimated costs under Alternative III are also considerablylarger than benefits. Furthermore, costs for the Powder River Basin increasedrapidly under Alternative III relative to Alternative II because existingSCM's would be regulated under the third alternative. Relative cost estimateswould presumably be even larger if the five basins analyzed under AlternativeII were analyzed similarly to the one coal basin under Alternative III.Therefore, Alternative III costs also appear unreasonable relative to benefitsprovided by other available lower cost options. As under Alternative II,the results for Alternative III are explained by such factors as relativelylow SCM-induced particulate concentrations, the limited size of the ambientimpact area, and the general absence of large populations in the vicinityof SCM's.Because Alternative IV potentially affects far fewer coal reserves thaneither Alternatives II and III, a different cost approach was undertaken.The social costs of removing the lease tracts at Bryce Canyon and ChacoCulture out of available reserves were estimated. Unlike Alternatives IIand III, the benefits considered under Alternative IV reflect only visibilitybenefits to park users. However, the benefits achieved by Alternative IVare highly variable and depend upon assumptions regarding visibility impactsof mining activities after implementation of this alternative. Also, unlikeAlternatives II and III, Alternative IV may yield significant additionalbenefits not addressed in the RIA. In particular, large potential visibilitybenefits could not be accurately estimated and were therefore excluded.Other difficult-to-estimate benefits, such as reduced mining noise andwater pollution, could further increase benefits realized under AlternativeIV. The RIA concludes that the results of the analysis for AlternativeIV are ambiguous, but that in any event, the costs of Alternative IV aremore nearly in balance with potential benefits than is the case with AlternativesII and III which yielded substantial negative net benefits. However, itis unclear that the costs of Alternative IV are reasonable consideringthat many if not all of the visibility and other benefits which might accruefrom PSD and NSR coverage would already be realized through compliancewith DOI regulations.Several factors limit the precision of the RIA. These limitations are discussedin the February 28, 1986 <T4>Federal Register</T4> and in greater detail in the RIA. The EPA musttake account of the RIA limitations and weigh many considerations, includingcomments on the RIA and proposed alternatives, in making a final decision.10. <T3>Modified Alternatives.</T3> On May 4, 1987, EPA placed in Docket A-84-33two additional alternatives based on modifications to Alternative IV. Thesewere identified as Alternatives IVandmin16; (IV prime) and IVandmin16;andmin16;(IV double prime). These options were designed to obtain the major benefitsexpected under Alternative IV, specifically the protection of significantnational land areas (e.g., national parks), while limiting the economiccosts incurred by focusing NSR coverage more directly on these areas. TheEPA specifically solicited the views of several parties who had previouslydemonstrated an interest in the issue surrounding Alternative IV. Responseswere received, placed in the rulemaking docket, and compiled in the summaryof comments for the rulemaking which was also placed in the docket. AlternativesIVandmin16; and IVandmin16;andmin16; are discussed in greater detail in the May4, 1987 memorandum to the docket (document number IV-C-6).Alternative IVandmin16; proposed that PSD review of a mine be triggered,not by a fixed ambient concentration, but by prediction of adverse impact.Under Alternative IVandmin16;, an increase in ambient particulate matter(PM) concentration of 1 microgram per cubic meter predicted by modelingwould trigger an ``ambient impact assessment,'' not a PSD review. Onlyif the ``ambient impact assessment'' indicated a potential adverse impact,as determined by the appropriate Federal land manager (FLM) for the affectedmandatory Class I \8\<NOTE/> and II PSD areas, would PSD be triggered. The adverse impactassessment is a process already used by FLM's. This alternative was considereda way to protect areas of special natural significance while reducing thenumber of mines subject to PSD determinations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Areas listed under section 162(a) of the Act cannot bereclassified and are generally referred to as mandatory Class I areas.The 158 areas are national parks over 6000 acres, national wilderness areasover 5000 acres, and international parks, all in existence on the PSD codificationdate, August 7, 1977. Only three nonmandatory Class I areas, all in Montana,have been created by redesignation of Class II areas and a fourth areain Washington has been proposed. All are Indian lands.Alternative IVandmin16;andmin16; included the same adverse impact test as AlternativeIVandmin16; but covered only impacts on mandatory Class I PSD areas. To removeuncertainties as to the application of the adverse impact analysis test,the 1 microgram per cubic meter increase in PM concentration test was droppedand all mines within 50 kilometers of a mandatory Class I area would besubject to an ``adverse impact assessment.'' This option would also provideprotection of the most important natural areas but only a consultationprocess between the FLM and the States would be established for many othernatural areas designated as mandatory Class II. This proposal would havereduced costs of compliance but would also produce reduced benefits withminimal, if any, protection of mandatory Class II areas.C. <T3>DOI Authority to Regulate._</T3>1<T3>. Provisions to Regulate Fugitive Dust From SCM's. </T3>The DOI hasdemonstrated to the EPA that under existing DOI statutory authorities,regulations, and policies, DOI can adequately protect against adverse effectsfrom SCM's, including fugitive dust emissions. The DOI's authority is particularlyeffective with respect to national parks and other areas of special concern,which are the focus of Alternative IV. The authorities identified by DOIinclude the following:<ITAG tagnum="81">a. SMCRA Performance Standards</ITAG>Section 515(b)(4) of the SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1201 et seq., establishes a performancestandard for control of air pollution from all SCM's, wherever located.The SCM's operators must stabilize and protect all surface areas, includingspoil piles affected by the mining, and reclaim areas to effectively controlerosion and attendant air and water pollution (30 U.S.C. 1265(b)(4)). TheDOI has promulgated mandatory performance standards for SCM's under thisstatutory requirement at 30 CFR 816.95(a). These standards are implementedin turn through 30 CFR 780.15, which provides that each application fora surface coal mining and reclamation permit must include ``[a] plan forfugitive dust control practices'' describing all measures the applicantproposes to use to stabilize exposed surface areas to control fugitivedust.Section 515(b)(17) of SMCRA addresses pollution associated specificallywith erosion from access roads into and across SCM sites. To implementthis provision, and to clarify the reach of 30 CFR 780.15 and 816.95, DOIrecently promulgated regulations establishing a performance standard forroad dust generated at SCM's:<ITAG tagnum="21">[b] Performance standards. Each road shall be located, designed, constructed,reconstructed, used, maintained, and reclaimed so as to:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">[1] Control or prevent erosion, siltation, and the air pollution attendantto erosion, including road dust as well as dust occurring on other exposedsurfaces, by measures such as vegetating, watering, using chemical or otherdust suppressants, or otherwise stabilizing all exposed surfaces in accordancewith current, prudent engineering practices;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">[2] Control or prevent damage to fish, wildlife, or their habitatand related environmental values;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">[6] Prevent or control damage to public or private property, includingthe prevention or mitigation of adverse effects on lands within the boundariesof the National Park System, the National Wildlife Refuge System, the NationalSystem of Trails, the National Wilderness Preservation System, the Wildand Scenic Rivers System, including designated study rivers, and NationalRecreation Areas designated by Act of Congress. [53 FR 45190, 45213 (November8, 1988) (to be codified at 30 CFR 817.150(b)(1), (2) and (6)].</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">b. SMCRA Section 522(e) Prohibitions</ITAG>Section 522(e)(1) of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1272(e), and 30 CFR 761.11 prohibitSCM's in certain designated areas, subject to valid existing rights (VER)and except where SCM's existed on August 3, 1977. Lands designated by section522(e)(1) and DOI's regulations include any lands within the boundariesof the National Parks System, the National Wildlife Refuge System, theNational System of Trails, the National Wilderness Preservation System,the Wild and Scenic Rivers System, including designated study rivers, andNational Recreation Areas designated by Act of Congress. Subject to VER,and with other exceptions, section 522(e) (2), (4) and (5) likewise prohibitsSCM's on Federal lands within National Forests, within 100 feet of publicroads and cemeteries, and within 300 feet of occupied dwellings, publicbuildings, schools, churches, community or institutional buildings, andpublic parks. In addition, section 522(e)(3) prohibits SCM's in any otherlocation where the SCM will ``adversely affect'' any publicly-owned parkor any place listed in the National Register of Historic Sites. The VERare discussed in detail below.Provision for a determination of adverse effect under section 522(e)(3)is included in the review process for the SMCRA permit that all SCM's mustobtain. Upon receipt of an application for operations that may affect aNational Park System Unit (NPSU), the SMCRA regulatory authority (eitherDOI, or a State acting under an approved program) provides the NationalPark Service (NPS) written notice and an opportunity to comment (30 CFR773.13(a)(3)(ii)). Where the regulatory authority preliminarily determinesthat the proposed operation would adversely affect an NPSU, under 30 CFR761.12(f)(1) it must request the approval or disapproval of the NPS beforeit can issue a SMCRA permit.<ITAG tagnum="81">c. SMCRA Section 522(c) Unsuitability Designations </ITAG>Section 522(c) of SMCRA grants any person ``having an interest which isor may be adversely affected * * * the right to petition the regulatoryauthority to have an area designated as unsuitable for surface coal miningoperations * * *'' Section 522(a) and 30 CFR 762.11(b) set out the criteriaunder which an area may be, but is not required to be, designated as unsuitablefor SCM operations. These include a finding that mining would affect fragile,historic, natural hazard, or renewable resource lands. Fragile lands include``areas containing natural, ecologic, scientific, or aesthetic resourcesthat could be significantly damaged'' by SCM operations; historic landsinclude ``areas containing historic, cultural, or scientific resources.''<ITAG tagnum="81">d. The Federal Coal Management Program </ITAG>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administers the FCMP, which appliesto SCM's on all Federal lands. According to DOI, the BLM effectively controlsapproximately 80 percent of western coal through the FCMP. During the land-useplanning stage of the FCMP, BLM applies four ``screens'' to public landswhere SCM's potentially could be located, including unsuitability criteriaand multiple-use decisions (43 CFR 3420.1-4(e)). Under unsuitability Criterion5, ``Class I visual resource management areas,'' areas of outstanding scenicquality or high visual sensitivity are considered unsuitable for leasingunder the FCMP unless the BLM determines that SCM operations will not significantlydiminish or adversely affect the scenic quality of the area (43 CFR 3461.1(e)).The multiple-use decision process balances uses and resources to decideif protection is needed (43 CFR 1601.0-5(f)). The DOI rules provide thatthe BLM ``shall place particular emphasis on protecting * * * air and waterquality * * *'' in making multiple-use decisions. Where coal developmenton BLM lands may impact lands under the jurisdiction of the NPS and theFish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the rules direct the BLM to consult withthose agencies to jointly determine whether the lands should be acceptablefor further consideration for coal leasing.In addition to the above provisions, DOI identified various other statutoryand regulatory provisions that could be used to regulate SCM operationsfor the purpose of protecting air quality. Some of these authorities arediscussed in Section IV. 2. <T3>Proposed VER Rules.</T3> The DOI proposed rules for determining VERon December 27, 1988 (53 FR 52374) which, when final, will effectivelygrandfather specified mining rights from provisions of SMCRA section 522(e).The EPA reviewed the proposed rule and determined that the grandfatheredexemptions from SMCRA, as proposed, do not appear to significantly affectDOI authority to regulate fugitive emissions from SCM's. The DOI will stillbe empowered to make ``unsuitability designations'' under section 522(c)and VER will only exempt mines from appeals under section 522(e) by affectedinterest groups. In any event, SCM's established by a VER determinationwill still be subject to construction and maintenance standards under 30CFR 816.95(a) that DOI may use to mitigate fugitive dust emissions.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion of Today's Action</ITAG>A. No Listing of SCM'sToday, EPA announces that SCM's will not be added to the list of sourcecategories for which fugitive emissions must be considered in determiningif a source is ``major.'' The effect of this decision is to maintain thestatus quo for SCM's under the Act. Since nearly all of an SCM's emissionsare fugitive, a decision to continue not to consider fugitive emissionsmeans that few, if any, SCM's will be classified as major sources or majormodifications. Although they may not be classified as major sources ormajor modifications, emissions from new or modified SCM's, particularlyin areas near national parks and other areas of special natural significance,will continue to be regulated by EPA, under other applicable provisionsof the Act, and by the DOI under the SMCRA and all other authorities ofthe DOI. The EPA has reviewed all relevant information in the rulemakingdocket and the regulatory and legislative powers available to DOI in makingthe determination that DOI has adequate authority to regulate fugitivedust emissions from SCM's. The EPA also finds that while overlapping regulationof SCM's under the Act is possible and not prohibited, such regulationis burdensome to the affected industry while likely achieving limited additionalbenefits.Although EPA has considered the effect of DOI authorities in deciding notto list SCM's, EPA is not granting preemptory authority to DOI for thecontrol of air pollution from SCM's. The Act will requires SIP's to containemission limitations, permit programs, and other measures to ensure thatambient standards and PSD increments are attained and maintained and thatthere is no manmade visibility impairment in any mandatory Federal ClassI area (sections 110, 161, 169A, and 172). The EPA and the States cannotabrogate their responsibility to regulate the emissions from SCM's. Theonly question here is whether or not new or modified SCM's should, as acategory of sources in and of itself, be subject to the PSD/NSR permitprograms for ``major sources.'' However, this decision cannot affect therequirement that SIP's regulate ``* * * the modification, constructionand operation of any stationary source * * *''. (section 110(a)(2)(D)).Neither SMCRA nor the Act contain any special dispensations for SCM's thatgrant them categorical exemptions from having to comply with ambient standards,PSD increments, or visibility protection requirements. Hence, with EPA'sdecision not to add SCM's to the list of PSD sources, EPA must still ensurethat emissions from SCM's comply with all requirements of the Act.The comments received on the EPA proposals and the EPA analysis of therulemaking record are summarized below in Section IV and contained in therulemaking docket.B. Collocated SourcesIn deciding to maintain the ``status quo'' regulation of SCM's, the EPAalso announces that it is not exempting SCM's from review under other circumstancespossible under PSD and NSR procedures, specifically SCM's collocated withsources subject to review. The EPA believes these circumstances are limitedin number and economic impact and do not warrant establishing the precedentof creating exemptions for specific sources. The EPA has determined toreaffirm its longstanding position that the decision whether to includefugitive emissions from collocated SCM's in these circumstances shouldbe decided on a case-by-case basis, depending on the ``primary activity''of the operation as a whole. The EPA also concludes that it has no obligationto depart from its longstanding use of the Standard Industrial Classification(SIC) code and other aspects of the definition of ``source'' for PSD andNSR purposes in order to satisfy its rulemaking obligations under section302(j) or to otherwise craft a reasonable and lawful set of PSD and NSRrules. These decisions resolve issues affecting SCM's raised in petitionsfor reconsideration. Comments and analysis of this issue are summarizedbelow in section IV.C. Modifications to Existing SourcesIn today's action, EPA reaffirms its October 1984 interpretation that section302(j) does not apply to modifications. Commenters have not persuaded theEPA either that Congress had a contrary specific purpose in adopting section302(j), or that EPA's interpretation, as explained in the October 1984proposal, is inconsistent with the Act's purposes. Accordingly, EPA believesthat its interpretation is a reasonable one, and thus proper under thelaw. In any event, EPA believes that this interpretation should have littlegeneral impact at this time, because today's central decision to not listSCM's means that few mines should be brought under PSD and NSR solely byvirtue of EPA's interpretation of the nonapplicability of section 302(j)to modifications. Comments and analysis of this issue are summarized inSection IV and the <T4>Federal Register </T4>[October 1984 (49 FR 43202) and February 1986(51 FR 7090)].<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Major Issues</ITAG>A. <T3>Basis For No Listing Decision_</T3>1. <T3>Comments on The RIA. </T3>Numerous comments were received on the RIAand were summarized into four categories: (1) The presence of health andwelfare effects associated with SCM's, (2) air quality impacts, (3) costestimates, and (4) benefit estimates. Comments from industry and some governmententities universally asserted that ambient impacts and costs were understatedwhile benefits were either nonexistent or at least overstated. Commentsfrom environmental groups maintained the opposite point of view and werecritical of EPA's use of cost-benefit analysis. Conversely, industry commenterscontended that the legislative history of section 302(j), and the D.C.Circuit Court's interpretation of that provision in <T3>Alabama Power Co. </T3>v. <T3>Costle, </T3>636 F.2d 323 (D.C. Cir. 1979), support EPA's use of cost-benefitanalysis. Most of the comments were originally addressed in the RIA underqualification of the various analytical components of the RIA. Those notaddressed in the RIA are covered in detail in two reports in the docket:(1) Summary of Comments, and (2) Response to Technical Comments. Whilethese documents can be reviewed for a thorough discussion of comments andresponses, a summary of major comments and responses is presented below.<ITAG tagnum="81">a. Health and Welfare Effects</ITAG>Several commenters argued that since the NAAQS are set at levels belowwhich there are no known adverse health or welfare effects, there wouldbe no benefits from listing SCM's because they are primarily located inareas where air quality is already better than the NAAQS for PM. The commentersare correct to note that the intent of the NAAQS requirements was to directthe Administrator to set air quality standards at pollution levels belowthose at which quantifiable adverse health and welfare effects have beenfound or might be expected to occur in sensitive groups. However, experiencewith the requirements has shown that the scientific data are often so inconclusivethat it is difficult to identify with confidence the lowest pollution levelat which an adverse effect will occur. Moreover, in cases such as the presentone regarding PM, the evidence suggests that there is a continuum of effects,with the risks, incidence, or severity of harm decreasing, but not necessarilyvanishing, as the level of pollution decreases (52 FR 24641, July 1, 1987).Other commenters argued that fugitive emissions from SCM's do not poseany health risks because such PM is less toxic than particles in urbanareas where most of the health and welfare effects information used toestablish the PM standards was obtained. This comment has limited meritbecause the NAAQS for PM nominally 10 micrometers or less in diameter (PM-10)NAAQS focuses on particles capable of penetrating the sensitive thoracicregion of the respiratory tract. While the toxicity of various particlesdiffer, the exhaustive review of the available health effects informationsupporting the PM-10 standards suggests that all particles equal to orless than a nominal 10 micrometers in diameter are of concern regardlessof source characteristics. Moreover, it is not clear that coal dust (certainlya constituent of SCM fugitive dust) per se is nontoxic. Indeed, coal dustmay contain toxic impurities, such as metals. In any event, ``inert'' particlesmay be responsible for a variety of health effects, from deposition throughoutthe respiratory tract and by several possible mechanisms. For example,nonspecific irritation in the tracheobronchial region may alter respiratoryfunction or clearance mechanisms, clearly of health concern, particularlyfor sensitive subgroups of the population (e.g., asthmatics and elderlypersons with chronic respiratory disease). [52 FR 24641, July 1, 1987]<ITAG tagnum="81">b. Air Quality Impacts</ITAG>A number of comments noted deficiencies in the Industrial Source Complex(ISC) model used to estimate ambient impacts around SCM's. While severalwell-documented analyses have shown that the ISC model has both systematicand random error associated with its use, the model still remains the preferredmethod for simple terrain stationary source analyses as specified in EPA's<T3>Guideline on Air Quality Models,</T3> Revised (EPA-450/2-78-027R, July1986). In the RIA, the model was applied consistently, and the EPA believesthe results are valid for relative comparisons across regulatory alternatives.<ITAG tagnum="81">c. Cost Estimates</ITAG>Different opinions from commenters were noted regarding the RIA cost estimates.For example, costs were asserted to be low by some commenters because theimpacts on the largest mines in each basin analyzed were not assessed.Conversely, another set of comments maintained that costs were overstatedbecause such controls as paved haul roads and speed restrictions were notconsidered. Regarding the first comment above, mine costs were estimatedusing the average size SCM in each basin. The EPA felt such an approachwas better for assessing the most likely costs of listing SCM's. Usingeither the largest or smallest SCM's for cost assessment would have clearlybiased the cost estimates presented.The recommendation to analyze paving haul roads and speed restrictionswas considered in the planning stages of the RIA. However, best engineeringjudgment based on Wyoming's best available control technology (BACT) analyseswas used to eliminate the former from consideration because of the increasedcost of paving roads that would support the enormous trucks used to transportcoal around a surface mine. Furthermore, continuous construction and demolitionof haul roads would be required as the pit changes location. This couldexacerbate the pollution problem and would be expensive. Speed restrictionswere not considered a viable option since reducing speed, for a constantproduction rate, would effectively require more equipment which would createmore emissions. Therefore, gains from reducing speed would be offset byadding additional trips to maintain production rate (speed and number oftrips equally affect SCM emission rates).More specific concerns were raised by commenters in regard to the quantityof coal reserves, and subsequent cost effects, affected under AlternativeIV. Industry maintained that approximately 8.5 billion tons of coal reserveswould be affected by Alternative IV_six times larger than EPA's estimateof 1.4 billion tons. It is true that the original EPA estimate is low dueto the exclusion of reserves on Indian lands. However, even the industryestimate of 8.5 billion tons affected represents less than 6 percent ofthe 157 billion tons of total reserves estimated in the RIA. Furthermore,the total reserve estimates in the RIA were selected as a conservativeestimate since current estimates of demonstrated coal reserves exceed 400billion tons.<ITAG tagnum="81">d. Benefit Estimates</ITAG>Several commenters maintained that benefit estimates, particularly, visibilitybenefits, were overstated. For example, it was asserted that willingnessto pay (or contingent valuation) studies of visual range improvement werebiased upwards because respondents exaggerate their responses when theydo not actually have to pay. In response, EPA notes that recent comparisonsbetween contingent valuation studies and market studies involving actualpayments do not support the hypothesis that contingent valuation is consistentlyupward biased (<T3>Response to Technical Comments on RIA for EPA Proposal to List SurfaceCoal Mines for New Source Review, </T3>PEI Associates Inc., EPA ContractNo. 68-02-4394, January 1989). While these studies have been found to containpotential biases, the direction of bias can be either upward or downwarddepending on the specifics of the study design.Other comments argued conversely that benefits estimates presented wereunderstated relative to costs because it is far easier to measure coststhan to quantify benefits. There is merit in this comment, but the RIAexplicitly recognizes this by listing benefit categories, such as nonresidentialsoiling, which are currently not quantifiable. Furthermore, where somebenefit categories are quantifiable, but highly uncertain, potential magnitudeis presented in the text of the RIA. A good example of this is the valuationof existence value benefits for Alternative IV. While the value of thisbenefit category is not used to compute the net benefit number in the RIA,a first order approximation of the value is presented in the text and isappropriately qualified.2. <T3>Comments on Proposed Alternatives. </T3>In addition to the commentson the RIA summarized above, comments were received on the viability andlegality of SCM regulatory alternatives proposed by EPA. The proposed alternativeswere summarized in Section II above. After considering comments on AlternativesII-IV, deferring at that time the question of duplicative regulation underSMCRS, EPA decided to modify Alternative IV in an attempt to design a clearlybeneficial rulemaking. Comments on these modified alternatives are alsodiscussed below.The comments below are organized by several categories: (1) Existing regulations,(2) implementation of alternatives, (3) majority recommendations, (4) minorityrecommendations, and (5) EPA analysis.<ITAG tagnum="81">a. Existing Regulations</ITAG>Most commenters argued that EPA is not legally bound to list SCM's andthat SCM's are already subject to sufficient air pollution regulation byState governments and other Federal agencies. Commenters noted that someState laws and regulations require control of emissions from SCM's equivalentto BACT. Comments from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) assertedthat mining operations on Federal lands adjacent to wilderness areas arecontrollable by USDA administrative policy. The existing authority mostfrequently cited as providing the protection sought by EPA under the proposedalternatives were programs administered by the DOI. Comments on DOI authoritiesand EPA analysis of the authorities are discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="81">b. Implementation of Alternatives</ITAG>Numerous comments were received on how the proposed alternatives wouldbe implemented. For example, industry claimed that EPA's proposal wouldeffectively create large ``buffer zones'' around Class I areas which areof no special natural value but where SCM's would be prohibited to preventpossible impacts within the Class I area. A State commenter asserted thatsome of EPA's proposed regulatory mechanisms were not consistent with Statepermitting procedures.Comments on specific procedures were also received. As an example, theUSDA suggested that a PSD review trigger, based on acreage disturbed ata specified time, would be simpler to apply than an emissions criteria.The mining industry suggested several changes to Alternative IV&quot; such asexcluding the FLM in the determination of adverse impact, reducing themine impact review criteria distance to between 10 and 15 kilometers, andexcluding any provisions for mandatory Class II PSD areas. Environmentalgroups also criticized including the FLM in the determination of significantadverse impact and implied that Indian Tribes, States, and EPA were bettersuited to make such decisions. These groups noted that Alternative IV&quot;provided no protection for Class II PSD areas and that mines located greaterthan 50 kilometers from Class I PSD areas would escape review regardlessof their impact on these areas. Several commenters from government agenciescriticized the 1 microgram PM per cubic meter ambient impact criteria forinitiating review in the Alternative IVandmin16; proposal because of uncertaintiesin the modeling analysis required for estimating the impact. Commentersexpressing a preference for Alternative IV&quot; cited the 50 kilometer distancecriterion in IV&quot; as a solution to the modeling problems associated withthe IV ambient impact trigger.<ITAG tagnum="81">c. Majority Recommendations</ITAG>Most commenters emphatically supported Alternative I (no listing of SCM's,therefore, fugitive emissions would not be included in the PSD and NSRapplicability determinations for SCM's). Some of the commenters supportingAlternative I included industry, State governments, Ute Mountain IndianTribe, and several Federal agencies. The consensus of these commenterswas that the costs of Alternatives II-IV exceeded the benefits of the proposedregulation.These commenters continued to support Alternative I over modificationsto Alternative IV. However, of the options requiring some listing of SCM'sAlternative IV&quot; was favored by a number of commenters. Industry commentersnoted that Alternative IV&quot;, with several changes, ``* * * more faithfullyadheres to the Agency's objective of protecting special resources* * *''(AMC) and, as applied to Class I areas designated by the Act, is the onlyproposed alternative which may have positive benefits (Sunbelt Mining Co.).The DOE considered Alternative IVandmin16; (applied only to mandatory ClassI PSD areas) to be most consistent with the analytical results. Two environmentalregulation agencies in coal mining States expressed similar opinions. Althoughthese commenters expressed some preference for Alterative IV&quot; among AlternativesII-IV, there was also a consensus that other existing regulatory authoritiescould provide benefits projected from Alternative IV&quot;.<ITAG tagnum="81">d. Minority Recommendations</ITAG>Robust, differing points of view were also expressed by two smaller groupsof commenters. One group, composed mostly of environmental groups, favoredlisting of SCM's under either Alternative II or III, the most stringentregulatory options. These commenters argued that regardless of the costsprojected, EPA should tightly limit fugitive emissions from SCM's underPSD and NSR regulations. Environmental groups generally viewed the proposedAlternatives IVandmin16; and IV&quot; as less acceptable than the original AlternativeIV which they rejected. The environmental groups' rejection of proposedvariations of Alternative IV was shared with DOI. The DOI emphaticallyrejected Alternatives IVandmin16; and IV&quot; and contested the distance criteriaof Alternative IVandmin16;andmin16; for PSD applicability as ``legally questionable,''arbitrary and lacking any empirical basis. In contrast to the environmentalgroups' recommendations for stringent EPA regulation, DOI joined the majorityin supporting Alternative I, no listing.<ITAG tagnum="81">e. The EPA Analysis of Comments On Proposed Alternatives</ITAG>The EPA's review of both the RIA and the comments indicate that AlternativesII and III are economically impractical. Although industry appears to haveoverestimated costs, the RIA still predicts very substantial adverse socioeconomicimpacts from these alternatives. Therefore, EPA rejected Alternatives IIand III.Based on a review of public comments and the RIA, EPA concludes that, whilemore appealing economically than Alternatives II and III, Alternative IV,as originally proposed, is not clearly beneficial given the uncertaintyin benefits and cost estimates. Industry assumptions produced very highimpact estimates of as much as 1 microgram per cubic meter up to 100 milesfrom the source, which resulted in very high industry cost estimates. WhileEPA does not agree with all of the assumptions used in the industry studies,EPA does agree that, in some locations, costs of Alternative IV may beconsiderable. However, EPA concludes that on a national basis, benefitsand costs cannot be firmly estimated.The final listing options EPA considered were Alternative I, no listingof surface coal mines, and Alternative IV or some variation of it designedto provide visibility and other benefits for natural areas of special significance(e.g., Yellowstone National Park). In considering these options, EPA placedsubstantial weight on the legal authorities available to the DOI whichcould also provide protection for areas of ``special natural significance.''The EPA does not necessarily agree with commenters that variations of AlternativeIV are impractical from a technical or legal perspective. However, it isnot necessary to respond to the merits of these comments, because theyare moot with the selection of Alternative I. The reasons for choosingAlternative I are not related to the technical and legal adequacy of AlternativesIVandmin16; and IV&quot;. The EPA did consider the ability of Atlernatives IVandmin16;-IV&quot;to protect NPSU's and other areas of special, natural significance in evaluatingthe intent and potential benefits of DOI authorities to regulate fugitivedust emissions from SCM's that might affect such areas. Comments concerningthe costs of duplicative regulation under the Act and SMCRA are of concernto EPA and are discussed in greater detail below.3. <T3>DOI Authorities. </T3>Several commenters, including the DOI and industryrepresentatives, urged EPA to not list SCM's on the ground that under existingDOI statutory authorities, regulations, and policies, DOI can adequatelyprotect against adverse effects from SCM's. The commenters stated thatthese authorities are particularly effective with respect to the nationalparks and other areas of special concern which are the focus of AlternativeIV. The DOI authorities were summarized above in Section II.<ITAG tagnum="81">a. Government and Industry Comments</ITAG>Comments submitted by DOI, other Federal agencies, and mining industrygroups supported the position that statutes, regulations, and policiesadministered by DOI would capture most or all of the social benefits thatmay result from listing SCM's in the vicinity of Class I and mandatoryClass II areas. Hence, these commenters opposed Alternative IV and othernarrowly focused regulatory options on this basis alone.Two events in particular involving DOI have resolved any doubts regardingits ability to prevent adverse air quality impacts from SCM operations.First, in <T3>National Wildlife Federation (NWF) </T3>v. <T3>Hodel</T3>, 839 F.2d 694, 765 (D.C. Cir. 1988), the Court of Appealsaffirmed that DOI has authority under SMCRA section 515(b)(4) to regulateair pollution that is attendant to erosion. Second, DOI has promulgateda performance standard under SMCRA to control dust due to both wind erosionand dust created by vehicle traffic (53 FR 45190, Nov. 8, 1988).Regarding SMCRA section 522(e), DOI remarked that it provides significantprotection to NPSU's and other publicly owned parks from potential impactson air quality and related values. Moreover, the term ``adversely affect''in section 522(e)(3) is not limited geographically by the location of theprospective mine or the nature of the adverse effect, but is applied ona case-by-case basis in consultation with the manager of the potentialaffected resource.As to the unsuitability designation provisions of SMCRA section 522(c),an unsuitability designation could be made for lands inside or <T3>outside</T3> of the boundaries of NPSU's. Furthermore, excessive levelsof fugitive dust emissions from potential SCM's could form the basis foran unsuitability designation where those emissions would significantlydamage the fragile or historic lands.<ITAG tagnum="81">b. Comments from Environmental Groups</ITAG>In comments submitted prior to the decision in <T3>NWF</T3> v. <T3>Hodel</T3> and DOI's promulgation of road dust rules, a coalition ofenvironmental groups argued that there is currently no governmental authorityeffectively regulating fugitive emissions from SCM's. In particular, thecoalition disputed DOI's claimed ability to protect Class I and mandatoryClass II areas, asserting that DOI has failed to fully exercise its authorityin any meaningful fashion. Regarding the prohibition in SMCRA section 522(e)(3)against SCM's that would adversely affect parklands, the environmentalgroups pointed out that the SMCRA regulatory authority is required onlyto consider the views of the NPS, and that NPS has no authority to enforceits recommendations. These groups also noted that no finding of adverseeffect or unsuitability under SMCRA has ever been made due to the impactsof mining on air quality.The environmental groups stated that ``[a]ll interested parties agree thatthe major percentage of fugitive emissions generated by surface coal miningoperations occurs as a result of traffic on haul roads.'' However, thegroups focused on the absence of a performance standard for road dust asrepresentative of DOI's purported failure to adopt any substantive regulatoryscheme to control fugitive emissions from SCM's.<ITAG tagnum="81">c. Analysis of Comments</ITAG>The EPA has carefully considered the presentations made by all interestedparties concerning the breadth of DOI's regulatory program for SCM operations.Based on this review, EPA agrees with the views of DOI (and others) that,as a whole, the various DOI authorities governing SCM's, while procedurallyquite different from PSD and NSR requirements, have the potential to provideadequate protections against adverse air quality impacts in mandatory ClassI and mandatory Class II areas. EPA believes that DOI authorities substantiallyoverlap with those which would be provided under Alternative IV or variationsof that regulatory option. Consequently, it would be superfluous to listSCM's for the purpose of protecting the NPSU's and other areas of specialconcern that are the subject of Alternative IV and its variations. Giventhe rough equivalence of costs and benefits for Alternative IV that emergedfrom EPA's RIA and analysis of comments on the RIA, EPA believes that theexistence of DOI regulatory authority providing much the same benefitsas would be afforded by EPA under the Act, but without the administrativecosts that the Clean Air Act coverage could entail, is an adequate basison which to reject Alternative IV and its variations pursuant to the rulesfor listing decisions under section 302(j).The EPA believes that under the range of authorities discussed above, DOIand State regulatory authorities, have extremely broad powers to preventthe potential harms addressed by Alternative IV and its variations. Thesepowers are at least as broad, and in some instances, broader, than thoseafforded to DOI and other Federal agencies in their role as FLM's, andto State governments and EPA itself in their role as permitting authoritiesunder the PSD and NSR provisions of Parts C and D of the Act. For example,under Clean Air Act section 165(d)(2)(C)(ii), if the FLM demonstrates tothe satisfaction of a permitting authority that emissions from a prospectivefacility would ``have an adverse impact on the air quality-related values(including visibility)'' of a Class I area, the State may not issue a PSDpermit. Similarly, under SMCRA section 522(e)(3), if the SMCRA regulatoryauthority determines that a prospective SCM would ``adversely affect''a publicly-owned park, the mine cannot be built if the responsible governmentagency agrees in that finding. Thus, under SMCRA Federal land managementagencies are powerful stewards of the public trust, charged with the responsibilityand authority to protect public lands of special concern.The VER could provide some exceptions to SMCRA section 522(e), althoughthe extent of any such exemption is unclear pending completion of DOI rulemakingon VER. However, any mine constructed in areas near NPSU's would stillbe subject to performance standards under SMCRA section 515 (b)(4) and(b)(17) and codified in 30 CFR 780.15, 816.150 and 816.95. Any mine operatingnear an NPSU would be expected to meet stringent construction and maintenancestandards. Indeed, DOI regulations provide the flexibility to require suchstringency for SCM's affecting NPSU's under DOI's policy of control inresponse to local conditions. In any case, nothing would prevent the Federalgovernment from buying back VER when there is significant public interestin protecting an NPSU and Congress appropriates funds for purchasing VERof concern. DOI has given notice in a statement of policy that to preventcoal mining in areas covered by SMCRA section 522(e), DOI will use availableauthorities to acquire VER through ``exchange, negotiated purchase or condemnation''subject to appropriation (53 FR 52384).The EPA also concludes that questions raised by comments from environmentalgroups concerning DOI's ability and willingness to protect the public trustby pursuing regulation of SCM's under the DOI authorities have been adequatelyanswered by events subsequent to the submission of those comments. <T3>NWF </T3>v. <T3>Hodel</T3> upheld DOI's authority to promulgate general SCM performancestandards requiring a plan for fugitive dust control practices under SMCRAsection 515(b)(4). The reasoning of that decision validates regulationspromulgated under other sections of SMCRA to address air pollution attendantto erosion. Thus, DOI cited the <T3>NWF</T3> v. <T3>Hodel</T3> decision in promulgating its road dust rules under SMCRAsection 515(b)(17) (53 FR 45202).In addition, DOI's adoption of road dust rules shows its willingness totake strong regulatory action on air pollution from all SCM's. As the environmentalgroup commenters noted, all parties agree that a significant amount offugitive dust from SCM operations is generated as a result of haul roadtraffic. In commenting on the DOI proposed rule, EPA related its understandingthat in addition to fugitive dust attributed directly to wind, the rulewould cover erosion-related pollution resulting from the movement of overburdenand coal haul trucks, light and medium duty vehicles, and other equipmentoperating outside of the mine pit using on-site roads and surfaces. TheDOI accepted this comment and made EPA's suggested change to the finalrule clarifying that performance standards apply to dust created by vehicletraffic (53 FR 45203).Evidence of DOI's specific commitment to protect the air quality relatedvalues of national parks and other sensitive areas is evident in the SMCRAprograms governing adverse effect determinations and unsuitability designations.As noted above, DOI has interpreted the unsuitability determination processas extending to damages caused by fugitive dust emissions from prospectiveSCM's. Although the environmental groups are correct that DOI has not designatedany Federal lands as unsuitable for mining based on potential adverse effectson air quality, DOI has rarely been called upon to do so.\9\<NOTE/> Thus, EPA has every reason to believe that DOI will responsiblypursue petitions alleging that a prospective SCM would adversely affectparklands.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The one instance in which this issue was raised, regardingthe Alton Coal Field and Bryce Canyon National Park, resulted in a determinationof unsuitability based on other grounds.Regarding the FCMP, DOI rules direct the BLM to place particular emphasison the air quality portion of the multiple use decision, and require theBLM to consult with the NPS and FWS prior to a joint determination of whetherBLM lands should be accepted for further consideration for coal leasing(52 FR 46469).3. <T3>Comparison of Cost and Benefits Under the Act and SMCRA. </T3>The EPA's``safety valve'' interpretation of section 302(j) clearly calls for theAgency's deliberative process to address legitimate cost/benefit concernsin reaching a listing decision (49 FR 43202). This approach to listingdecisions is under review in <T3>NCA </T3>v. <T3>EPA</T3> and is not at issue here. As discussed elsewhere in this notice,EPA believes that commenters have confirmed that the benefits of adoptingAlternatives II or III are greatly outweighed by the costs associated withthose options. The EPA disagrees with these commenters' similar argumentsregarding Alternative IV. Nevertheless, the EPA is not compelled to adoptAlternative IV or some variation of it. As it addressed Alternative IV,the RIA did not take into account the prospect that DOI could provide equivalentenvironmental benefits. However, for the reasons set forth above, EPA nowbelieves that the various DOI authorities already in place can providemuch the same degree of environmental protection as would PSD under theAct. Thus, few, if any, additional socioeconomic benefits would be providedby a decision to list SCM's under Alternative IV or its variations. Conversely,a decision to list could entail additional costs sufficient to justifynot taking that course of action.By accepting that DOI's programs will provide benefits equivalent to AlternativeIV through the mitigation or prevention of adverse effects on air qualityrelated values in national parks and other areas of special concern, EPAis assuming a roughly similar mix of pollution control measures, reductionsin SCM size, and SCM relocations as was assumed would accompany AlternativeIV. It follows that EPA should also assume that the DOI programs will alsoentail roughly similar costs to producers and others in realizing thosebenefits. One might argue that it also follows that the addition of PSDunder Alternative IV would add no additional costs beyond those alreadyrequired by the DOI programs, and, thus, EPA must promulgate regulationsunder its ``safety valve'' interpretation of section 302(j). But, in practicalterms, this is not true. Such an argument ignores the fact that the DOIprograms are already in place, and that the addition of another set ofregulatory requirements is inherently costly. Thus, even if the additionof Alternative IV required no sources to meet (or change their plans toavoid) PSD requirements because DOI programs would have already obviatedthe need for such actions, there would still be the built-in administrativecosts of the EPA program to contend with. For example, under AlternativeIV the SCM owner might be required to undertake a separate modeling analysisfor the sole purpose of demonstrating that it would not exceed the PSDcoverage threshold of a 1 microgram per cubic meter (andCx.18;g/m\3\) impacton a Class I or mandatory Class II area.To give another example, if pursuant to Alternative IV a prospective SCMwere brought under PSD because it exceeded the 1 andCx.18;g/m\3\ thresholdat a Class I national park located at a considerable distance from theSCM site, it would trigger an adverse impact determination by the FLM underthe Act, section 165(d)(2)(C)(ii). If the FLM found, and the permittingauthority agreed, that an adverse impact would occur, the mine could notbe built. However, as discussed above, the responsible State or Federalagency may conduct a similar analysis under SMCRA, and the SCM could notbe permitted if that agency and the SMCRA regulatory authority agreed therewould be an adverse affect on the park. Thus, in this example also, PSDwould entail costs to the prospective source in applying for a PSD permitand to the FLM in making a separate adverse impact determination underthe Act, yet these costs would not provide any benefits not already presentunder the DOI authorities.In short, nothing in the Act or EPA's interpretation of section 302(j)requires EPA to promulgate regulatory requirements that provide no benefitswhere there are some, albeit modest, costs. Indeed, under such circumstances,even modest costs are unreasonable precisely because they are not counterbalancedby benefits. In taking due account of the environmental protections providedby SMCRA, the FCMP, and other DOI authorities, EPA believes that today'ssection 302(j) decision is an appropriate exercise of the ``flexibilityto provide industry-by-industry consideration and appropriate tailoringof coverage'' which the D.C. Circuit envisioned in <T3>Alabama Power Co. </T3>v. <T3>Costle,</T3> 636 F. 2d 323, 369 (D.C. Cir. 1979). At present, EPA hasno basis to question the adequacy of DOI's authorities. Of course, if inthe future EPA is presented with a petition for rulemaking containing appropriateevidence that the various DOI authorities do not in fact provide environmentalprotection equivalent to that available under the Act, EPA will carefullyreconsider the basis for today's action.B. Fugitive Dust Issues Related to SCM'sThe EPA's actions in October 1984 (49 FR 43202) and February 1986 (51 FR7090) reaffirmed the Agency's 1980 interpretation regarding the natureof the section 302(j) rulemaking requirement, and retained the list ofsources whose fugitive emissions must be considered in making PSD and NSRTAD's. Although EPA believed its 1980 rulemaking met the procedural standardsof section 307(d)(8), 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(8), as a matter of policy the Agencysolicited further comment on the listing of source categories. The EPAstated that, consistent with its ``safety valve'' interpretation of section302(j), it would not remove a category from the list unless commentersshowed adverse consequences to the broad national interest in continuingthe listing. Public comment on these matters was generally limited duringthe initial round of comments. However, mining industry representativesexpressed several concerns related to SCM's which could result in a sourcebeing subjected to PSD and NSR even if EPA made a final determination notto list SCM's. The industry's concerns included the interaction betweenthe definition of ``source'' for PSD and NSR purposes and the currentlylisted fugitive emissions source categories and the applicability of section302(j) to major modifications. To the extent that SCM's would be indirectlysubject to PSD or NSR, several industry representatives filed petitionsfor administrative reconsideration of EPA's October 1984 action (see ``AMCPetitions'', section II above) seeking relief, either through a changein the definition of source, or through deletion of certain, currentlylisted fugitive emissions source categories. Accordingly, in reopeningthe public comment period in February 20, 1986 <T4>Federal Register</T4>, EPA solicited comment on whether, if EPA decidednot to list SCM's, some exemption from or interpretation of the ``source''definition as it relates to section 302(j) rulemaking would be appropriate.The following discussion of the SIC code definition of source and listedsource issues constitutes EPA's substantive disposition of industry commentsand the applicable petitions for reconsideration.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. SIC Code Definition of Source</ITAG>The 1980 PSD and NSR regulations established the SIC Manual as the principaldefinitional tool for identifying the types of pollutant-emitting activitiesthat shall be considered part of the same industrial grouping for purposesof determining the scope of a stationary source for NSR purposes. Specifically,activities within the same Major Group, i.e., the same two-digit SIC code,are aggregated [see, e.g., 40 C.F.R. 52.21(b)(6)]. As EPA noted in theFebruary 28, 1986 <T4>Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 7090), use of the SIC code has implicationsfor the mining industry by virtue of the fact that SIC Major Group 12,``bituminous coal and lignite mining,'' includes not only the mine properbut also coal cleaning and other coal preparation activities. ``Coal cleaningplants (with thermal dryers)'' are on the list of fugitive emissions sourcecategories [see, e.g., 40 CFR 52.21(b)(1)(iii)(a)]. Coal preparation plantsare also listed because a new source performance standard regulating them(40 CFR Part 60, Subpart Y) was promulgated prior to August 7, 1980 [see,e.g., 40 CFR 52.21(b)(1)(iii)(aa)]. The mining industry raised two principalissues stemming from this aspect of the definition of source: applicabilityof substantive PSD and NSR requirements to SCM's considered to be partof a major source because they are collocated with such sources, and inclusionof fugitive emissions from SCM's in the PSD and NSR threshold applicabilitydeterminations of collocated sources.<T3>a. Industry Comments.</T3> Mining interests contend that SCM's arenot a type of stationary source that Congress intended to be subject toPSD and NSR requirements. In their view, EPA's error in considering regulationat all is compounded by the Agency's attempts to impose on SCM's the SICcode and other attributes of the PSD/NSR definition of source that maybe appropriate for other industries but cannot be properly applied to SCM'sthrough a ``definitional quirk.'' Any regulation of SCM's by virtue ofthe source definition is arbitrary and in excess of EPA's authority, theyassert, unless EPA complies with the rulemaking requirements of section302(j). Industry commenters claimed that consideration of SCM fugitivedust emissions as the ``secondary emissions'' of an off site support facilityin determining the air quality impact of a major stationary source is alsoprecluded absent compliance with section 302(j).<T3>b. Analysis.</T3> The EPA disagrees fundamentally with the industrycontention that rulemaking under section 302(j) is a broad prerequisiteto any regulation of SCM's under the Act and PSD/NSR programs.\10\<NOTE/> To the contrary, EPA continues to believe section 302(j)has only a limited ``safety valve'' function. Once the Administrator determinesthat sources in a given source category have the potential to degrade airquality significantly, commenters have an opportunity to present factualand policy arguments sufficient to convince the Administrator that it wouldnot be appropriate to include fugitive emissions from sources in that categoryin TAD's. Section 302(j) is irrelevant in defining the scope of the term``source'' and in applying substantive PSD and NSR requirements. Thus,in <T3>Alabama Power</T3> v. <T3>Costle,</T3> the D.C. Circuit upheld EPA's position that section 302(j)has no bearing whatsoever on the applicability of substantive PSD requirementsunder section 165 after a source is determined to be major (636 F.2d at369). In addition to establishing the limited reach of section 302(j),the <T3>Alabama Power</T3> decision is highly informative of the limited scopeand discretionary nature of those rulemakings which must be conducted underthat section. Consequently, in both the 1980 and 1984 final rulemakings,EPA reasonably concluded that Congress consigned any problems of measurement,modeling, and pollution control regarding fugitive emissions to individualpermit proceedings (45 FR 52690-92 and 49 FR 43203). Similarly, in itsfinal action on the rulemaking proceeding arising out of Exhibit A of the<T3>CMA</T3> Settlement Agreement, EPA concluded that where SCM's functionas off site support facilities for a major stationary source, the mine'sreasonably quantifiable fugitive dust emissions must be included in theair quality impact analysis for the major source, and that it is not necessaryto conduct a section 302(j) rulemaking to make this finding [54 FR 27286,27290, (June 28, 1989)].<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Industry representatives must present their argumentson the listed source issues as requests for clarification or reconsiderationof EPA's definition of source and current list of fugitive emissions sourcecategories. In so doing, they at least tacitly acknowledge that these issuesare separate from the limited question presented by the proposal to listSCM's under section 302(j).Based on the above, EPA concludes that it has no obligation to depart fromits longstanding use of the SIC code and other aspects of the definitionof ``source'' for PSD and NSR purposes in order to satisfy its rulemakingobligations under section 302(j) or to otherwise craft a reasonable andlawful set of PSD/NSR rules. The EPA also reaffirms its interpretationof section 302(j). Moreover, EPA believes that the results of this conclusionreflect adequate consideration of the particular characteristics of theSCM industry, consistent with EPA's obligation to administer and enforcethe Act. In addition, EPA does not believe that the effects of today'saction will be unduly burdensome to industry.2. <T3>Listed Collocated Sources.</T3> As discussed in the February 1986 (51FR 7090) reopening of the public comment period, EPA's position has beenthat stack emissions and fugitive emissions from a coal cleaning plantor coal preparation plant must be summed in determining whether it wouldbe a major stationary source. If, standing alone, such a plant were ``major,''and therefore subject to review, then a collocated SCM generally wouldalso be considered part of the major source and subject to substantivePSD and NSR requirements regardless of whether SCM's are listed. (See AlabamaPower, 636 F.2d at 369). Such operations typically must be aggregated asa single source under EPA's rules because they belong to the same SIC twodigit code, and typically are located on adjacent or contiguous propertiesand are under common control.\1\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ For the same reasons, stack emissions from the minemust also be added to the emissions of the preparation or cleaning plantin determining threshold applicability.The EPA believes that the structure and function of its regulations inthe above examples are reasonable and appropriate under the Act. Indeed,industry commenters have presented no evidence of adverse practical consequencesfrom this view, because coal preparation plants and coal cleaning plantsapparently do not usually exceed major source size thresholds. A more difficultquestion is presented by whether the fugitive emissions of a collocatedSCM must also be considered for threshold applicability purposes. Industrycomments and EPA's February 1986 notice pointed out that a strict constructionof the regulations with respect to the SIC code could result in the entireoperation, including the SCM, being considered as part of the ``listed''coal preparation or coal cleaning plant. The EPA has determined to reaffirmits longstanding position that the decision whether to include fugitiveemissions from collocated SCM's in these circumstances should be decidedfor each occurrence, depending on the ``primary activity'' of the operationas a whole. As stated in the preamble to the 1980 regulations, ``[e]achsource is to be classified according to its primary activity, which isdetermined by its principal product or group of products produced or distributed,or services rendered'' (45 FR 52695).\1\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ See also Memorandum, Edward E. Reich, Director, StationarySource Compliance Division, EPA to John M. Daniel, Assistant ExecutiveDirector, Virginia Air Pollution Control Board, May 31, 1983; Memorandum,Edward E. Reich to Allyn Davis, Director, Air and Hazardous Materials Division,EPA Region VI, June 8, 1980.Under this primary activity test, EPA or the permitting authority shouldreview all the facts and circumstances of the particular case to determinewhat is the main purpose and function of the overall operation, and makean applicability determination based on the status (listed vs. nonlisted)and tonnage threshold (100 tons per year vs. 250 tons per year) of theprimary activity. Thus, as SCM's continue to be a nonlisted source category,where coal mining is the primary activity, a mine's fugitive emissionsare not considered in determining threshold applicability for a sourceconsisting of the mine and some other collocated activity. In both of thefinal determinations cited above, EPA concluded that the coal mine wasthe primary activity, and EPA anticipates that this would be the case inmost, if not all, future examples involving coal processing activities.In terms of both the purpose of the enterprise and the economic value ofthe newly mined coal as compared with the processed coal, it is the miningthat is the focus of the overall effort.<T3>3. Support Facilities_a. Collocating Sources of Differing SIC's. </T3>Miningindustry commenters also raised closely related questions arising fromthe collocation of listed sources and SCM's that are under different two-digitSIC codes. They noted that when EPA articulated the primary activity testin the 1980 regulations, the Agency stated: ``one source classificationencompasses both primary and support facilities, even when the latter includesunits with a different 2-digit SIC code. Support facilities are typicallythose which convey, store, or otherwise assist in the production of theprincipal product'' (45 FR 52695). These commenters noted, that in 1980,EPA stated, in response to a specific comment, that a power plant and aSCM connected by a 20-mile railroad would be considered separate sourcesbecause of the distance and the different two-digit SIC codes, but soughtclarification as to a SCM and a closer or adjacent coal-fired power plant.As stated above, these matters must be decided on a case-by-case basis.However, EPA anticipates that it would, in most cases, conclude that aSCM and an adjacent mine-mouth power plant controlled by the same entitywould be considered a single source, the primary activity of which is eitherthe generation of electrical power or the mining of coal, depending onthe most likely overall purpose of the facility. If the mine and powerplant were isolated in a remote area, for which the power plant is designedto support mining operations, the primary activity would likely be determinedto be mining. However, if the facility is not isolated and service capacityof the power plant obviously exceeds the needs of the mine alone, and thefacility will generate power for a public utility, then EPA would likelyfind that both the central purpose of the enterprise and the principallocus of its economic value is power generation. In the latter example,because power plants in excess of 250 million BTU heat input per hour arelisted sources (see, e.g., 40 CFR 52.21(b)(1)(iii)(z)), the fugitive emissionsof the SCM would be included in TAD's, and the SCM would be subject tosubstantive PSD and NSR requirements.Industry commenters object to this possible outcome for two reasons. First,they contend that unless SCM's are separately listed, use of the factorof geographic proximity to consider a SCM as part of a single source thatalso includes a power plant violates the rulemaking requirements of section302(j). However, as suggested above, section 302(j) does not require rulemakingas to SCM's in order to make such a finding. Regarding the listing of fossil-fuelfired steam electric plants as such, commenters have not demonstrated thatconsidering SCM's as part of a source that also includes a power plantis, for the threshold applicability purposes of section 302(j), unreasonable.In practical terms, virtually all power plants in excess of 250 millionBTU heat input exceed the major source threshold without considerationof fugitive emissions from collocated SCM's. Also, as discussed previously,<T3>Alabama Power </T3>conclusively determined that once a source is foundto be major and subject to review substantive PSD and NSR requirements``apply with equal force to fugitive emissions and emissions from industrialpoint sources'' (636 F.2d at 369). Thus, today's action should have noimpact on existing coverage of collocated SCM's and power plants.<T3>b. Economically Forced Relocation Sources. </T3>Industry's second objectionis that including a SCM and a listed power plant as a single source wouldencourage relocation of the power plant to a distant location and therebycause adverse energy and environmental impacts. Although there is somesurface plausibility to this notion, commenters did not clearly demonstratethat such a result would occur. More importantly, this objection does notrelate to the proper scope of a section 302(j) inquiry, but rather to EPA'sdefinition of ``source,'' and these commenters have not shown that it isunreasonable for EPA to adhere to its consistent and longstanding constructionof this term rather than create a special exemption for SCM's. Similarly,the commenters have not shown that it would be unreasonable to retain thecurrent list of fugitive emissions source categories.<T3>4. Continuance of Status Quo. </T3>Finally, as to both the supportfacility issue and the SIC code issue, it is clear that the central thrustof the mining industry's objections to PSD and NSR coverage is the specialpleading that SCM's would be unable to meet applicable air quality requirementsin an economical fashion. As discussed elsewhere in this notice, it isno longer clear that this is universally the case. Moreover, the net resultof today's action is not to add any new regulatory requirements, but merelyto retain the status quo, under which only certain SCM's collocated withcertain other listed sources must meet substantive PSD and NSR requirements,including ambient impact requirements. However, the need to demonstratethat SCM's collocated with listed sources will not exceed applicable NAAQSand increments, the focus of industry's concerns, is already in place byvirtue of EPA's prior action on ``secondary emissions.'' As explained inthe preamble to that action, EPA concluded that the Act mandates the inclusionof such secondary emissions as a general matter (54 FR 27290). The EPAtoday reaffirms that conclusion.C. <T3>Applicability of Section 302(j) to Modifications_</T3>1. <T3>Background. </T3>In the 1984 rulemking proposal, EPA solicited commenton its interpretation that section 302(j) applies to TAD's only for majornew sources, and not for major modifications to existing major stationarysources (49 FR 43213). The EPA pointed out that the language of section302(j) explicitly attaches the rulemaking requirement only to existingor proposed major sources, and says nothing about major modifications toexisting units. The EPA also noted that the PSD and nonattainment NSR definitionsof modification in section 169(2)(C), 42 U.S.C. 7479(2)(C), and section171(4), 42 U.S.C. 7501(4), are both nonsubstantive, and refer to section111(a)(4) of the Act's new source performance standards (NSPS) provisions,42 U.S.C. 7411(a)(4). Section 111(a)(4), in turn, defines modificationsolely in terms of the total amount of pollution that a source change wouldproduce, indicating that Congress intended to establish no qualitativedistinction between stack and fugitive emissions. Moreover, EPA stated,the legislative history on section 302(j) does not refer directly to modifications,although the conference report on the PSD construction and modificationdefinitions in section 169(2)(C) does provide that Congress' general intentwas ``to conform to usage in other parts of the Act'' [123 Cong. Rec. H11957, col. 3 (daily ed.) (November 1, 1977)]. The EPA reasoned that thispassage referred not only to section 111(a)(4), but to usage of these termsin extant EPA regulations under the NSPS and PSD/NSR programs. Those regulationsdid not distinguish between fugitive and stack emissions. Thus, EPA concludedthat section 302(j) ran counter to longstanding practice, and that if Congresshad intended a legislative change as to modifications, it would have saidso explicitly. In addition, EPA related that its interpretation likelywould not impose new regulatory burdens because fugitive emissions frommodifications would still be excluded from TAD's unless the modificationsoccurred at a major stationary source. Thus, if SCM's continue to be nonlisted,and therefore generally deemed not to be major sources, a modificationthat significantly increased fugitive emissions at a SCM still would nottrigger PSD and NSR.In reopening the comment period in February 1986, EPA reiterated its viewthat the nonapplicability of section 302(j) to modifications would notaffect PSD and NSR applicability in the general case, but pointed out thatresolution of the ``listed source'' issues could affect this outcome (51FR 7093).2. <T3>Industry Comments. </T3>Mining industry representatives commented thatsection 302(j) should apply to modifications. They disagreed with EPA'sinterpretation of the legislative history, believing instead that congressionalsilence on the subject disclosed a lack of guidance. The AMC asserted thatsince new sources and modifications are generally treated the same in mostrespects under the Act, there is no basis to treat them differently undersection 302(j).Industry commenters also argued that EPA must resolve, in the context ofa separate rulemaking under section 302(j), certain ambiguities as to what``physical change or change in the method of operation'' would result ina ``significant net emissions increase'' at a major stationery source andtherefore constitute a major modification subject to NSR. (See, e.g., 40CFR 52.52(b)(2)(i).) In their view, EPA's October 1984 proposal was inadequateto apprise the interested public of the purpose and intent of the proposaland how it relates to other existing regulatory requirements.Peabody Holding Co., pointed out that due to the nature of SCM's, theremust constantly be movement of mining operations as mining progresses alongthe coal deposits, possibly requiring the addition of new equipment oreven the development of a new pit as the reserves in the existing pit aremined out. The NCA similarly asserted that physical or operational changesof this nature are a normal part of strip mining. Peabody suggested thatEPA adopt a test which provides that any activity or change at a mine thatrepresents a logical mining sequence of the mine's production pursuantto the mining plan used by State authorities in issuing air quality permits,or mining and reclamation permits in instances where air quality permitswere not required, can serve as a guide to whether a modification wouldoccur. Thus, activity in conformance with the mining plan should not beconsidered a modification when the mine owner has previously used thatplan as a basis for securing all required permits. Peabody noted, however,that in some cases, especially in the eastern half of the United States,the mining plan will not cover the future movement of the mine for morethan a few years because such movement depends upon the future acquisitionof mineral rights in adjoining land. The movement of the mine to thosesites in the future should not be considered a modification of the existingmine for NSR purposes so long as it represents a logical progression ofmining activities. In Peabody's view, changes such as the addition of morehaul roads or a change in pit sequences, would be routine and not constitutea modification.The NCA asserted that increases in production up to maximum design productioncapacity of a mine and increases in emission up to the maximum allowedin air quality permits should not be considered a major modification. TheAMC contended that since many existing mines have not been required tohave permits, there is some question as to whether emissions decreasesoccurring at a mine are ``federally enforceable'' and, therefore, whetherthe owner or operator could obtain credit for decreases (such as from ahaul road that is no longer in use) in making netting calculations. TheAMC also pointed out that actual emissions baseline issues must be addressed.3. <T3>Environmental Group Comments. </T3>The Sierra Club agreed with EPAthat section 302(j) does not apply to modifications. However, this commentercontended that EPA should not ``grandfather'' modifications that occurprior to today's action, on the ground that EPA's view to the contrarywas contained only in the August 1983 proposal and was never promulgated.4. <T3>EPA Analysis. </T3>Upon consideration of the comments, EPA reaffirmsits October 1984 interpretation that section 302(j) does not apply to modifications.Commenters have not persuaded the Agency either that Congress had a contraryspecific purpose in adopting section 302(j), or that EPA's interpretation,as explained in the October 1984 proposal, is inconsistent with the Act'spurposes. Accordingly, EPA believes that its interpretation is a reasonableone, and thus proper under the law [See <T3>Chevron, U.S.A. Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), </T3>467 U.S. 837 (1984)].In any event, EPA believes that this interpretation should have littlegeneral impact at this time, because today's central decision to not listSCM's means that very few mines should be brought under NSR solely by virtueof EPA's interpretation of the nonapplicability of section 302(j) to modifications.The EPA's interpretation, in conjunction with today's resolution of the``listed source'' issues could in theory have the effect of subjectingcertain modifications at existing SCM's to PSD and NSR in some fashion.For example, increases in fugitive emissions resulting from physical oroperational changes at mines collocated with coal preparation plants andcoal cleaning plants that are deemed to be major sources would be consideredin determining whether there was a ``significant net increase in emissions,''and, hence, a major modification. However, industry commenters have identifiedno instances in which coal preparation or cleaning plants would, underEPA's resolution of the ``listed source'' issues, be considered major sources.Even if there are such cases, EPA's interpretation would have a practicaleffect on the ambient impact analysis requirements of PSD and NSR onlyin those instances, if any, where there were changes in mining operationsthat increase fugitive emissions significantly without associated significantincreases in emissions from the coal preparation or coal cleaning facilitiesstanding alone.Significant increases in fugitive emissions at mine collocated with powerplants also could result in PSD and NSR coverage by virtue of the reaffirmationof the current list of fugitive emissions source categories. However, asis the case with major new sources as explained above in the discussionof the ``listed source'' issues, this result does not flow from any decisionas to the application of section 302(j) to SCM's. In addition, as a practicalmatter, today's decision would have an impact only in those instances,if any, where significant increases in fugitive emissions from mines werenot accompanied by significant increases at collocated power plants.The EPA also rejects industry comments that the Agency must engage in aseparate section 302(j) rulemaking to resolve issues relating to the applicationof existing regulatory concepts associated with the definition of modificationto the particular circumstances presented by SCM's. These issues do notrelate directly to EPA's interpretation of the rulemaking requirementsof section 302(j), to the decision whether to list SCM's, to the applicabilityof section 302(j) to modifications, or to the ``listed source'' issuesthat are the principal subject of this rulemaking. Rather, as industrycommenters concede, their concerns relate to the interpretation of EPA'sexisting modification regulations.\1\\3\<NOTE/> Accordingly, EPA is under no obligation to address industry'sconcerns in order to conclude this rulemaking. Moreover, as a general matter,since the comments in question essentially call for an interpretative ruling,the Administrative Procedure Act exempts EPA altogether from any legalobligation to engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking before addressingthem.\1\\4\<NOTE/> Nevertheless, because these comments do raise questions ofpotential importance in the event that modifications to SCM's should, inpractice, be subject to review, EPA addresses some of them here.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ See, e.g., Comments of Peabody Holding Co., Inc., DocketEntry No. A-84-33-IV-L-36 (May 26, 1986), at 38.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ In any event, it is evident from the cogent and focusedcomments summarized above that mining industry representatives have beengiven ample opportunity to address this matter.In sum, EPA believes that the general applicability concepts associatedwith its definition of ``major modification'' may be readily adapted toSCM's. The EPA rejects the inference of industry commenters that theseconcepts are somehow alien to the practical realities of SCM's. Nevertheless,it is appropriate to clarify certain general matters regarding the useof these regulatory concepts in the context of mining operations. Specificapplication of these concepts can only be addressed from the posture ofa particular mine and of necessity are beyond the scope of this discussion.The EPA agrees with the basic thrust of Peabody's comments as to when changesat an existing SCM should be deemed physical or operational changes forpurposes of the PSD and NSR major modification rules. When a prospectivenew source in a traditional industrial source category receives air qualitypermits, as, for example, under the Act's PSD provisions, the permit allowsconstruction and operation of specified facilities at specified levels.So long as the source constructs and operates in accordance with the permitterms, the ebb and flow of its activities will not trigger a major modification.Conversely, if, after initial construction and operation under the permit,the source institutes a physical or operational change resulting in a significantnet increase in emissions, it will be subject to review as a major modification.These general concepts may be applied to SCM's.Thus, if there are instances where a specific mining plan specifies thelocation, methods, and extent of mining activities, and forms the basisof permitting decisions by State or Federal agencies under air qualityor surface mining laws and regulations, a source generally could engagein the mining activities set forth in that plan without triggering a majormodification. For example, where the mining plan contemplates that thepit will move to specified new areas over time and contemplates the new,extended, or modified haul roads will be constructed to accommodate thatmovement, such haul roads could in the normal course be considered partof the source as originally constructed, and not as a modification. Likewise,if the original mining plan provides for increases in production over timeand discusses in detail associated changes in the mining operations inorder to accommodate such increased production, including any changes necessaryunder applicable law in order to address air quality concerns, such changesgenerally would not trigger PSD review.Conversely, where a mining operation moves to a new area not part of theoriginal mine plan, because, for example, mineral rights to the area inquestion were not secured prior to filing the original plan, constructionof a new, modified, or extended haul road would be deemed a physical oroperational change that may trigger review. Similarly, a mining operationmay move to an area that, while nominally part of the original plan, hasnot undergone complete consideration of air pollution control requirementsor air quality impacts to the extent necessary under applicable laws orregulations. This might occur because, for example, the regulatory authoritycould not adequately foresee the environmental impact of such future operationsat the time of original approval and therefore retained the right to giveadditional consideration to such matters at some future time. Under suchcircumstances, changes in the mining operations could be deemed a physicalchange or change in the method of operation, and potentially trigger review.In addition, an original mining plan may provide for a particular levelof production and specify the means by which that production may be achieved.However, if it later becomes the case that physical or operational changesnot contemplated by the original mining plan are necessary in order toachieve the maximum production design capacity, emissions increases associatedwith such increased production may be subject to PSD review.However, where changed operations such as those discussed above are cognizablefor NSR purposes, a mine owner or operator would also be entitled to seekoffsetting, federally enforceable decreases in current actual emissionsin order to avoid review. This could be accomplished, for example, througha State construction permit acknowledging the cessation of operations ona haul road no longer needed. In general, as this discussion illustrates,EPA believes that the usual concepts by which major modification applicabilityis determined can be readily applied to SCM operations. Of course, someconsideration must be given to the circumstances of the strip mining industry,as often must be done for other specific industries. In addition, the applicabilityin a particular case must be determined on the basis of the facts and circumstancessurrounding that case.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Administrative</ITAG>A. DocketThis regulatory action is subject to the provisions of Clean Air Act section307(d) [see section 307(d)(1) (i) and (n)]. The docket for this regulatoryaction is A-84-33. The docket is an organized and complete file of allthe information submitted to or otherwise considered by EPA in the developmentof this proposed rulemaking. The docket allows interested parties a meansto identify and locate documents to effectively participate in the rulemakingprocess and now serves as the record in case of judicial review (exceptfor interagency review materials ([section 307(d)(7)(A)]). The docket isavailable for public inspection at EPA's Central Docket Section, whichis listed under the ADDRESSES section of this notice.B. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) ReviewUnder Executive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291), EPA must judge whether a regulationis ``major'' and therefore subject to the requirement of an RIA. Althoughthe proposed regulation was considered major and an RIA was prepared onthe proposal, the final action is not major because it will not resultin an adverse economic effect set forth in section 1 of E.O. 12291 as groundsfor finding a regulation to be major. This regulation was submitted tothe OMB for a 10-day review as required by E.O. 12291. In addition to beingconsidered minor, this action is also subject to a court required publicationdeadline for final action in <T3>Sierra Club </T3>v. <T3>Thomas, </T3>No. 88-1847 (D.C. Cir.). Any written comments from OMBto EPA and any EPA responses to those comments are included in Docket A-84-33.No additional reporting and record keeping requirements will occur as aresult of today's action. All record keeping and reporting requirementsresulting from the Federal PSD and NSR regulations have been submittedto OMB for approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C.3501, et seq. and have been assigned OMB clearance No. 2060-0003. Today'saction does not add substantively to the existing regulations and focusesprimarily on resolving issues which result from EPA not listing a sourcecategory for consideration of fugitive dust emissions under section 302(j).C. Economic Impact AssessmentThe requirement for performing an Economic Impact Assessment under section317 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7617) does not apply, because this action doesnot make ``substantial revisions'' to existing regulations. The actionis not substantial because it does not add to the current regulatory burdenand simply retains existing provisions.D. Federalism ImplicationsUnder Executive Order 12612 (E.O. 12612), EPA must determine if a rulehas federalism implications. Federalism implications refer to substantialdirect effects on the States, on the relationship between the nationalgovernment and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilitiesamong the various levels of government. For those rules which have federalismimplications, a federalism assessment is to be made. The E.O. 12612 also requires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrainfrom limiting State policy options, consult with State prior to takingactions that would restrict State policy options, and take such actionsonly when there is clear constitutional authority and the presence of aproblem of national scope. The E.O. 12612 provides for preemption of Statelaw, however, if there is a clear congressional intent for EPA to do so.Any such preemption, however, is to be limited to the extent possible.Today's action will not affect States beyond the current requirements underFederal PSD and NSR regulations. Under these existing regulations, Statesmay adopt strategies if the strategies, taken as a whole, accomplish thestatutory purposes of the Act. In addition, the regulations that EPA haswill allow States to develop approvable methods of implementing the existingregulations.In summary, no modifications are being made to the existing EPA-State relationshipby today's action. Consequently, there are not federalism implicationsof this action.E. Regulatory Flexibility Act CompliancePursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that thisrule, if promulgated, will not have significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small business entities (see 46 FR 8709).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>40 CFR Part 51Administrative procedures and practices, Intergovernmental relations, Airpollution control, Prevention of significant deterioration, National parksand wilderness area, Fugitive emissions, Coal strip mining, Particulatematter, Nitrogen dioxide, Carbon monoxide, Hydrocarbons, Lead.40 CFR Part 52Air pollution control, Prevention of significant deterioration, Nationalparks and wilderness areas, Fugitive emissions, Coal strip mining, Particulatematter, Nitrogen dioxide, Carbon monoxide, Hydrocarbons, Lead.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 16, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William K.
