 Running sales and accounting applications, forinstance, require access to multi-user databases with real-time response, andthe voluminous files used in high-end desktop publishing, image processingand CAD cry out for faster throughput.andM;There are several ways for Macintosh users to get into the fast lane: add-inEthernet boards and gateways, SCSI adapters, token-ring cards, and LocalTalkspeed enhancers.andP;  User needs dictate which method is most efficient.andM;Ethernet cards and gateways.andP;  Ethernet cards and gateways enable Macs to linkto Ethernet networks, but upgrading an existing LocalTalk network to Ethernetand running new cabling can prove to be an expensive proposition.andP;  Onesolution is to use concentrators, or active hubs, aimed at loweringEthernet's cost per port.andM;Farallon's EN line of network connectors and star controllers, and Nuvotech'sline of concentrators and connectors work with add-in cards to run Ethernetover twisted-pair wire previously dedicated to LocalTalk.andM;&quot;By using Ethernet StarControllers and Local-Talk StarControllers, we'remaking it easy for network managers to put users on Ethernet who need to beand everyone else on LocalTalk, to get the best price/performance for theentire internet,&quot; said Larry Jones, network product manager of FarallonComputing Inc. of Berkeley, Calif.andM;Nuvotech's Nuvostar ET is an eight-port active hub that includes a &quot;cascade&quot;port for daisychaining up to eight additional hubs, according to GeorgeArabian, vice president of marketing.andM;Sausalito, Calif.-based Nuvotech also offers a SCSI Ethernet adapter.andP;  At$495, the NuvoLink SC can reduce Ethernet costs by as much as half, accordingto Arabian.andM;Boulder, Colo.-based Compatible Systems' Ether+ and Milpitas, Calif.-basedAdaptec's Nodem, a more expensive solution, are the other products in theSCSI Ethernet adapter  category (see review, Page 58).andM;Shiva Corp. of Cambridge, Mass., has recently announced the EtherGate, amultifunction LocalTalk-to-Ethernet device aimed at reducing the cost ofconnectivity.andM;How fast is fast?andP;  By hooking up to Ethernet, users may expect throughputequal to its 10-Mbps data transfer rate, which is 40 times faster thanLocalTalk's 230 Kbps.andP;  They won't get it.andM;&quot;With Ethernet, you're buying 40 times the carrying capacity so you can putmany more things on the network talking at the same time,&quot; said Steve Nelson,director of Apple product marketing with Novell Inc. of Walnut Creek, Calif.andO;&quot;It's not necessarily a big speed improvement point to point, but the overallnetwork throughput is enhanced.&quot;andM;Performance can be affected by a number of factors, including the speed ofthe processor and the type of bus.andP;  &quot;In each case, you'll get a slightlyhigher level of performance for a higher price,&quot; said Ted Stabler, presidentof Cayman Systems of Cambridge, Mass.andP;  &quot;Users run into bottlenecks longbefore they even get to the 10 Mbps.&quot;andM;Token ring.andP;  The same issues arise with token-ring networks, according toStabler.andP;  &quot;The speed of the system bus and the bandwidth of token-ring cardsaffect the actual performance you'll realize, and the performance will fallshort of the theoretical limit of 4 Mbps,&quot; he said.andM;Token-ring cards are available from Apple, h-three Systems of ResearchTriangle Park, N.C., and Asante Technologies of Sunny-vale, Calif.andM;Enhancing LocalTalk.andP;  While the choices are varied for users who can affordto move to Ethernet, Sun Microsystems' TOPS Division in Alameda, Calif., andDayna Communications Inc. of Salt Lake City have targeted midrange networkswith their FlashBox and DaynaTalk LocalTalk speed enhancers (See Comparison,Page 47).andP;  Priced at less than $200 per node, both products hold out thepromise of a threefold increase over LocalTalk's data transfer rate.andM;FlashBox runs on a TOPS protocol called FlashTalk at a speed of 768 Kbps.andO;DaynaTalk runs at speeds of 600 Kbps, 740 Kbps and 850 Kbps, and alsosupports FlashTalk's 768 Kbps.andM;Only communications between two Mac IIs can achieve DaynaTalk's maximumoutput, according to David Pascoe, a spokesman for Dayna Communications.andO;When different types of Macs are used, the slower machine sharply reducesDaynaTalk's speed.andM;Separate adapter boards for IBM PCs and compatibles allow both products tosupport mixed networks of Macs and MS-DOS machines.andM;When part of a mixed-speed network, data collisions are a problem for bothproducts.andP;  Slow-speed LocalTalk devices can't detect higher-speed DaynaTalkor FlashTalk transmissions, so collisions occur on the wire, degradingperformance.andM;The products address collision-avoidance differently.andP;  DaynaTalk includesSpeedGuard Timing, a proprietary software scheme that enables low-speedmachines to detect high-speed transmissions.andP;  The hitch is that SpeedGuardTiming only works on 68000-based machines and not on the Macintosh SE/30, II,IIcx and IIx or on LaserWriter Plus and later printers.andP;  The newer machinesrequire the $70 SpeedGuard Collision Filter, which plugs in the way aDaynaTalk box does and requires an external power supply.andM;TOPS, on the other hand, uses a $189 repeater to isolate FlashTalk nodes fromLocalTalk nodes.andP;  Repeaters get around data collisions by blocking slowertransmission signals.andM;Performance degradation.andP;  Industry experts warn users that the actualperformance they will get from LocalTalk boosters won't equal any solution'sdata transfer rate, which is the speed of the wire itself.andM;David Pedersen, an accountant in Cleveland, was hoping for the full speedincrease from DaynaTalk.andP;  He tested the product by uploading WordPerfect,Excel and FoxBASE+/Mac from a Mac SE to the server (an AST 10-MHz machinewith a 40-Mbyte hard drive).andM;&quot;I was hoping to get a two to three times increase, he said, &quot;but I didn'tget as much an increase in speed as I thought I would.&quot; In fact, it tooknearly as long to upload WordPerfect with DaynaTalk as without.andP;  WithDaynaTalk, uploading Excel took about two-thirds as long, and uploadingFoxBASE took half the time.andM;FlashBox didn't speed up Joel Peskoff's nine-node (three Macs, three PCs andthree LaserWriters) network as much as he thought it would, but it did havesome effect, said the assistant director of information of a New Yorkmunicipal agency.andM;&quot;We're using FlashBox and FlashCard on PCs and it's not quite as fast asadvertised,&quot; Peskoff said.andP;  &quot;It's not three times faster, but it isnoticeably quicker.andP;  It triples the speed of the transfer, but in real timeit's a 50 percent increase in speed.andP;  For $150, it's worth it.&quot;andM;As with Ethernet or token ring, users should beware that additional stickingpoints on the network, which have nothing to do with the media, can degradeperformance.andM;&quot;People often say a network is too slow because they're trying to access dataon the server,&quot; said Seth Neiman, engineering manager for TOPS.andP;  &quot;The realproblem may be that the database engine is too slow or the server is tooslow.andP;  So the first problem is getting users to realize that networkperformance is only part of the equation.&quot;andM;Before making the move to a LocalTalk enhancer or to Ethernet, users shouldanalyze their networks to find exactly what is slowing down the data flow,said Bob Clarke, vice president of the product evaluation group of InfoneticsInc., a market research firm in Santa Clara, Calif.andM;&quot;What users see at the desktop is often interpreted as being a slowness dueto the network's speed,&quot; Clarke said.andP;  &quot;Much of the time it has to do withthe applications on the network.andP;  And all of it depends on how busy thenetwork is.&quot;andM;For the most part, industry observers expect products like FlashBox andDayna-Talk to be stopgap measures that will garner little market share.andP;  Thereal market is in Ethernet, on which most mixed networks reside and wheremost Mac networks will eventually migrate, they predict.andM;&quot;FlashTalk and DaynaTalk are special enhancements in well-defined TOPS orDaynaNet environments,&quot; said Novell's Nelson.andP;  &quot;If you're getting intogeneral mixed-computing environments, you'll go with an industry standardlike Ethernet.&quot;andM;Brad Baldwin, a LAN industry analyst with Dataquest Inc., a market researchfirm in San Jose, Calif., agreed.andM;&quot;I can see certain advantages to boosting LocalTalk speeds higher,&quot; Baldwinsaid.andP;  &quot;But will the user spend $200 to do that or $500 and get 10 Mbps?andM;&quot;DaynaTalk and FlashTalk are proprietary systems,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Users aremoving to Ethernet speeds and into industry-standard environments.andP;  If I werean MIS director, I don't think I'd waste time with these types of products.&quot;andM;Emily Kay is a free-lance writer based in Chelmsford, Mass., and a frequentcontributor to MacWEEK.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
