If you think tax progressivity is a bad idea, you've got a friend in Pennsylvania.    With a &quot;progressive&quot; tax system, the higher a person's income, the larger the income share subject to tax. It's the opposite of a &quot;flat&quot; tax where everyone pays the same rate, no matter how much they earn.    A study by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees concludes that of the 40 states and the District of Columbia with broad-based income taxes, 21 made their taxes more &quot;regressive&quot; in the past year. That is, in some instances lower-income taxpayers are paying more -- relative to wealthier taxpayers-- in state income tax in 1987 than they did a year earlier.    The union -- a champion of increased progressivity in the tax system -- finds its conclusions surprising, since most states tie their income-tax formulas to a greater or lesser degree to the federal tax code. And by eliminating loopholes and removing millions of low-income Americans from the tax rolls entirely, the union says the federal income tax has become more progressive.    When states applied the new federal code to their own tax code, however, the results proved uneven.    &quot;Federal tax reform worked because standard deductions, exemptions and rates were very carefully balanced with base-broadening at various income levels,&quot; says Michael Mazerov, author of the AFSCME study. &quot;Some states didn't do a very careful job of that, and wound up with something considerably worse.&quot;    California, Idaho, Maine, Oregon, South Carolina and Utah &quot;did an outstanding job&quot; in tilting tax liabilities away from the poor and toward the well-to-do, says the AFSCME. In California, a family of four with two wage-earners making $24,000 no longer pays state income tax; the family paid $167 in taxes in 1986. Idaho added two tax brackets for high-income residents.    Other states made their income taxes less progressive. The study says that in Nebraska, a wide range of income levels pay more after the 1987 changes, with the middle class getting the biggest hike. The District of Columbia went from 10 tax rates to three, resulting in larger tax liability in 1987 for persons earning less than $17,500 than before. In West Virginia, middle-income married couples are hit with 50% to 60% tax hikes. Some other states with less progressive income taxes in 1987, according to the union: Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Minnesota, New York and Wisconsin.    Pennsylvania ignored federal tax reform entirely. Taxpayers there pay a flat 2.1%, no matter how much they earn. Personal exemptions aren't allowed.    Karl Ross, a deputy revenue secretary in Pennsylvania, concedes that Pennsylvania's wealthy may not pay much, but &quot;there are no deductions or shelters they can hide behind.&quot; Tax forms are simple, and easy to file, and revenue is steady year to year, he adds.    Mr. Ross says the flat tax is also a good business-development tool. When companies investigating Pennsylvania hear about the flat tax, &quot;they get a friendly feeling toward the state,&quot; he says. &quot;That's one of the reasons you don't see a movement to replace it.&quot;    ---                      Ranking the States   The following figures look at the income-tax progressivity of  selected states. In Maine, an average household with two wage earners and two children and 1987 income of $125,000 paid more than 10 times the state income tax of a similar household with a $24,000 income. In Pennsylvania, the tax paid by the two households was identical.              Maine                         10.7              South Carolina                 6.1              Rhode Island                   5.7              New York                       4.1              Ohio                           3.2              Georgia                        2.2              New Jersey                     1.8              Massachusetts                  1.7              Illinois                       1.2              Pennsylvania                   1.0   Source: American Federation State, County and Municipal Employees</TEXT></DOC>
