Since the U.S. attorney in Miami was named to his post onan interim basis in June 1988, a steady stream of disgruntledlawyers have left. The departures have raised concerns at theJustice Department about the management of one of the mainoutposts in the federal war on drugs.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, Mr. Lehtinen's nomination to the prosecutor'sjob has sunk into the murky politics of Capitol Hill. Someobservers predict it may never emerge for a Senate votebecause neither Democrats nor Republicans want a publicairing of charges that Mr. Lehtinen physically bullied aformer wife and a former woman friend. Mr. Lehtinen hasdenied the allegations.   Mr. Lehtinen came to national attention in January whendeposed Panamanian ruler Manuel Noriega was brought to Miamifor trial on drug racketeering charges. Mr. Lehtinenimmediately announced that he would supervise the politicallycharged prosecution. Just as quickly, questions arose aboutMr. Lehtinen's courtroom skills, his temperament and why hehadn't ever been formally nominated to the job. Within weeks,Attorney General Dick Thornburgh nudged Mr. Lehtinen off theNoriega case.   When he received the interim appointment during the Reaganadministration, the prosecutor had only recently returned tolegal practice after nearly eight years as a statelegislator. Since then, the decorated Vietnam veteran hasbuilt a reputation for shouting fits and public humiliationof subordinates. A number of prosecutors have left the Miamioffice, with at least five experienced lawyers departing inFebruary alone.   Former subordinates complain about Mr. Lehtinen's emphasison absolute personal loyalty. &quot;You can't think aboutdisagreeing or questioning anything,&quot; says one formerprosecutor. &quot;With Dexter, you're either with him or againsthim.&quot;   Mr. Lehtinen, in contrast, cites establishment of a strict&quot;chain of command&quot; as one of his major accomplishments. Hesays the prosecutor turnover rate in Miami has actuallydecreased during his tenure. He also claims to have increasedemployee productivity and to have brought more drug,organized crime and public corruption cases than hispredecessors. (Such comparisons are difficult because theoverall size of the office has grown steadily.)   Mr. Lehtinen says his record has been distorted byself-interested former employees and the media. &quot;There is nocontroversy,&quot; he says. &quot;It doesn't exist.&quot;   Top aides to Attorney General Thornburgh have a differentview. They're worried about morale problems in the Miamioffice and about domestic violence allegations against Mr.Lehtinen. Publicly, Mr. Thornburgh's aides say they have &quot;noproblems&quot; with the nomination. But privately they try toabsolve the attorney general of responsibility, insisting thedecision was made at the White House.   Why would President Bush proceed with this seemingly riskynomination? For one thing, Mr. Lehtinen has the backing ofSen. Connie Mack (R., Fla.) and the president's son, JebBush, who is active in Florida politics. The administrationalso wants to show support for Mr. Lehtinen's wife, IleanaRos-Lehtinen, a conservative GOP congresswoman popular withMiami's Cuban-American population.   In addition, the White House is counting on the Senatetradition of rubber-stamping U.S. attorney nominations,despite the considerable power the 94 regional federalprosecutors wield in deploying the government's massive lawenforcement arsenal. In Mr. Lehtinen's case, the chairman ofthe Senate Judiciary Committee, Joseph Biden, hasn't decidedyet whether to break precedent and hold a public hearing, letalone lead any opposition. Some observers believe that theDelaware Democrat, who attempts to keep the peace on a deeplydivided committee, doesn't relish the prospect of a messybattle over Mr. Lehtinen's private life.   According to some Washington sources, anxiety on bothsides could produce a compromise: The Judiciary Committeewould sit on the nomination until after Ms. Ros-Lehtinen'sre-election bid in November. If she wins, the White Housewould withdraw her husband's nomination and quietly offer hima position that doesn't require Senate confirmation.   What would be lost in the process, however, would be aclear verdict on whether Mr. Lehtinen deserved to beappointed to the U.S. attorney job in the first place.</TEXT></DOC>
