Gorbachev ahead of thisweek's NATO summit here, apparently worried the Soviet leader maybe wooing the West too well.   ``The Russian bear was easier to deal with when it looked morelike a bear than it does now,'' aides quoted Mrs. Thatcher astelling a private meeting of NATO ambassadors on Feb. 17.   ``The nicer the Russians get, the more dangerous they are.''   Her remarks underlined the dilemma of the right-wing Britishleader who has developed a warm personal relationship withGorbachev.   She now appears in a bind over how to keep encouragingGorbachev's internal reforms without also encouraging sentiment fora further erosion in nuclear weapons and military spending inWestern Europe on grounds the Soviet Union is no longer much of athreat.   Thatcher aides deny she has done a U-turn on the Soviet leadershe once hailed as someone ``I can do business with,'' and who gaveher a red carpet welcome on an official visit in Moscow last spring.   But British officials acknowledge alarm over Gorbachev'srelatively benign image in the West.   Lord Carrington, NATO secretary-general, indicated thatGorbachev may succeed in dividing the 16-nation North AtlanticTreaty Organization by generating complacency.   ``It is rather a curious paradox that it's much easier to holdthe alliance together when they're frightened than when they'renot,'' Carrington said in a recent British Broadcasting Corp. radiointerview.   ``But the fact still remains that there is an enormous militarypotential on the other side of the Eastern border.''   Polls indicate a more relaxed attitude among West Europeans tothe neighboring Communist giant under the urbane Gorbachev.   A survey by Datagroep of The Netherlands among 6,064 people innine West European countries last spring indicated that nearlytwo-thirds thought that public views of the Soviet Union hadrecently grown warmer.   Mrs. Thatcher, who has been among Gorbachev's most outspokenadmirers in the West, appears to have helped the shift in publicopinion.   After her Moscow visit last spring a Gallup sounding reportedthat 58 percent of Britons thought the Soviet Union ``really wantedto be friendly with the West.'' Just 33 percent thought Sovietadvances should be treated ``with the greatest suspicion.''   Britain's Economist weekly commented: ``Could that in part be aresult of the flattering attentions the prime minister has beenhappy to receive from Mr. Gorbachev?''</TEXT></DOC>
