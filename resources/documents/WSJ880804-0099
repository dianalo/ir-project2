Welch Jr., the chairman of General Electric Co., gave GE's National Broadcasting Co. his view of the world.    He loved NBC, he told executives assembled in a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., hotel. If NBC kept its ratings up, he said, his voice rising, its earnings could push GE's market valuation past Exxon Corp. to rival No. 1 International Business Machines Corp. &quot;And the more value this company has, the more things we can buy!&quot; he said.    That urge to buy has built GE into a $40 billion enterprise that is expected to earn $3.4 billion this year -- about a 17% gain -- and, some think, nearly $5 billion in 1991. And the 52-year-old executive with the combative temper, boyish grin and disarming stutter is reaping the credit.    &quot;Welch is the best CEO in the world today,&quot; says former GE executive Richard W. Miller, echoing many academics and GE executives past and present. &quot;There is no corporation in the world with stronger management.&quot;    But despite all the admiration for Mr. Welch, a minority view is forming. It pictures GE as a growing collection of disparate companies in which a domineering personality substitutes for business focus. That it has worked so far, critics say, is no shield against a day of reckoning. &quot;The person who follows Jack Welch at GE has a big problem because GE is being run according to his style and his breadth,&quot; even Mr. Miller acknowledges.    The churning of GE has produced little more than a retooled version of a 1970s conglomerate, contends Harvard Business School Prof. Michael Porter. Thomas Peters, the author of &quot;In Search of Excellence,&quot; seems to agree. Once &quot;the most glorious technology company of the century, GE has become a hodgepodge,&quot; he says.    Analysts say GE shares lag 36% below last year's high partly because portfolio managers find it too complex. &quot;Who can figure out how things fall to the bottom line in financial services or what GE pays in taxes? Nobody,&quot; says Nicholas Heymann of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. &quot;People have a tendency to say, 'It can't go on. I can't understand it.'&quot;    Other past and present executives also worry that Mr. Welch's ruthless reshuffling has battered GE's legendary corporate loyalty. &quot;Loyalty to a company, it's nonsense,&quot; responds Mr. Welch testily. But even he concedes that small technology companies with close-knit communications may be more a model for American management than GE.    In his nearly eight years at the helm, Mr. Welch has spent $16 billion to stamp GE's logo on, among other things, RCA Corp., the immensely profitable Employers Reinsurance Co., 80% of Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., the medical-equipment business of Thomson S.A., appliance-maker Roper Corp., and the chemical business of Borg-Warner Corp. He has also shed more than 100,000 GE employees through forced retirements, layoffs, resignations and outright divestitures.    The plan, he explained early in his chairmanship, was to derive a bigger share of earnings from technology and services and less from core manufacturing businesses. He even sketched three circles labeled &quot;core,&quot; &quot;services&quot; and &quot;technology.&quot; GE would also dump businesses that weren't No. 1 or No. 2 in their markets.    But former executives say this much-touted &quot;three-circle&quot; strategy was just sales talk for Wall Street and employees. The idea was even simpler: GE companies would either dominate their industries or Mr. Welch would get rid of them and acquire others. Mr. Welch himself recently suggested that he would sell some businesses in those sacrosanct circles, specifically GE's communications and service businesses, including GE Information Services.    Meanwhile, Prof. Porter says, Mr. Welch's strategy of investing only in businesses that are No. 1 or No. 2 in their markets is a 15-year-old idea that leads managers to focus on size instead of competitive advantage. It also stifles creativity, says Mr. Peters, who adds that GE hasn't created a new business for decades.    To Mr. Welch, the critics seem misguided. &quot;Michael Porter disagrees with No. 1 and No. 2?&quot; he says incredulously. &quot;I wish my kids weren't both going to Harvard. I hope they don't take his course. I can't think of an industry where I'd like to be less than No. 1 or No. 2.&quot; Mr. Peters, Mr. Welch adds, is just angry that GE didn't renew his contract at its Crotonville, N.Y., manager-training school. &quot;My record is a hell of a lot better than Tom Peters' record,&quot; Mr. Welch says. Mr. Peters contends that GE is one of the few clients he ever quit.    GE's diversity, Mr. Welch argues, allows it to take cash from one business to build another with faster-growing profits. This year, for example, NBC's $500 million cash flow will help pay for the Borg-Warner plastics operations. Far from being a technological wasteland, GE has developed a host of new plastics and aircraft engines in recent years, Mr. Welch says. But building new businesses from scratch, concedes Edward E. Hood Jr., a vice chairman, is just too &quot;difficult for us to manage.&quot;    Pulling out chart after chart showing how GE stock has outperformed market averages during his reign, Mr. Welch proclaims, &quot;Maybe we are dull, but we ought to get points for being consistent. In any three-month period, you can pick a better investment. But I don't think you can beat {GE} over a sustained period of time.&quot;    The stock clearly hasn't been a world-beater recently. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average has rebounded 22.7% since the Oct. 19 market crash and the Sandamp;P 500 index has climbed 21.4%, GE shares have risen only 0.9%. Closing yesterday at $42.25, they are only slightly above their 12-month low of $38.375.    And when pressed to explain why GE's return on equity is only now approaching its 1979 high of 20.2%, Mr. Welch threatens to walk out of an interview. His reluctant response: &quot;From peak to trough, it's a 10% change! If you were talking about a 30% drop, maybe you'd have a discussion.&quot; In other words, he contends it's irrelevant.    Mr. Welch deals summarily, though generously, with GE employees who don't share his vision or measure up to his standards. &quot;Some people past a certain age aren't trainable, and they do better to leave GE,&quot; says Brian H. Rowe, the head of the aircraft-engine group. As Mr. Welch's hand-picked lieutenant running medical systems, John M. Trani, puts it, &quot;The Welch theory is those who do, get, and those who don't, go.&quot;    Thus, GE's executive corps increasingly reflects Mr. Welch's own drive and personality. No intellectual despite a doctorate in chemical engineering, divorced last year after 28 years of marriage, Mr. Welch is a man whose true love is business.    Talk about GE's growing size and complexity stirs a grin of boyish delight. His conversation is laced with mentions of &quot;winning&quot; and a &quot;bias to action,&quot; phrases increasingly echoed in GE ranks. Ever blunt, he calls his managers &quot;grunts&quot; and &quot;turkeys.&quot; He sometimes is &quot;excitable to excess,&quot; Vice Chairman Hood says.    Leonard Vickers, a former marketing vice president, recalls reviewing an ad-agency presentation with Mr. Welch. &quot;I was using my indirect English to tell the agency it wasn't on target,&quot; Mr. Vickers says. &quot;Jack just picked up the storyboard, threw it on the floor and said, 'See? We don't like it! It doesn't work!'&quot;    Abrasive from the moment he started his career in GE's nascent plastics business in 1960, Mr. Welch manages by what he calls &quot;constructive conflict,&quot; a hazing-by-shouting-match approach that requires managers to argue strenuously with him even if they agree.    &quot;You can't even say hello to Jack without it being confrontational,&quot; says Ralph D. Ketchum, the former head of GE's lighting business whom Mr. Welch abruptly &quot;retired&quot; in 1986. &quot;If you don't want to step up to Jack toe-to-toe, belly-to-belly and argue your point, he doesn't have any use for you. He's very smart, so he has an opinion about everything.&quot;    An aggressive salesman of his management ideas, Mr. Welch visits every class at the company's training center and sometimes spends hours with the business press. New GE managers get a taped message discussing his visions and values for GE, such as &quot;ownership,&quot; &quot;candor,&quot; &quot;quality&quot; and &quot;entrepreneurship.&quot; He has tightened control over promotions and approves career moves of GE's top 500 managers. His prime job, he says, is &quot;resource allocator&quot; of money and people.    His ability to excite loyalty among the troops, says James Baughman, the head of corporate management development, bears comparison with Alfred Sloan of General Motors Corp. and Thomas Watson Sr. of IBM.    &quot;I look at Jack as two guys,&quot; says Grant Tinker, the former NBC head whom Mr. Welch tried desperately to keep. &quot;He's a good guy you can hang out with, a man's man. The same guy walks into the office, and he's like a chess player. People aren't people anymore. Apparently, he can live that way.&quot;    But can GE? Critics say the fallout from Mr. Welch's swap last year of GE's consumer-electronics business for the medical-equipment lines of Paris-based Thomson illustrates the price GE pays for his style. Many consumer-electronics managers had come only recently from GE's healthier major-appliance business -- lured by Mr. Welch's willingness to attempt a turnaround in consumer electronics.    When he suddenly sold the business, they were dumbfounded. Stephen F. Holmes, who had been general manager, product design, for all GE major appliances and transferred to consumer electronics only two months before the sale, jumped ship to GE's archrival, Whirlpool Corp. Mr. Holmes declines to be quoted, but colleagues say that after devoting his whole career to GE, he felt betrayed.    Mr. Welch, who suggested the swap to Thomson, says it was the only way to get Thomson's medical-equipment business, which he says will be more profitable than consumer electronics. As for managers who moved their families to take jobs in consumer electronics, they &quot;are better off,&quot; he says, because the business will do better under Thomson.    But the swap sent a message throughout GE. &quot;A lot of people tend to feel any business is up for sale,&quot; says George Smith, a manager at GE's aerospace operations, where defense cuts have further increased insecurity. He also hears &quot;a lot of talk about loyalty and that it doesn't hurt people to have multi-industry or multicompany experience.&quot;    The message Mr. Welch says he is sending, however, is that by cutting management layers and delegating responsibility, &quot;we are trying to create an atmosphere where people want to work, a nonbureaucracy where people have a chance to flourish. Now, do all of them absorb it and grab it? Not yet. That is my job.&quot;    Yet those who do &quot;grab it&quot; may simply be learning loyalty to Mr. Welch, some people say. &quot;Jack's ideal manager is strong, independent, a great leader -- and will agree with him,&quot; contends Jacques Robinson, a former vice president who lost out to Mr. Miller for the top job in consumer electronics. Mr. Welch retorts: &quot;I hope I have gut people around here.&quot;    No one knows the long-term cost -- or benefit -- of the Welch culture at GE. But there are signs it may not work at NBC. News employees remain suspicious of their new parent's motives, according to a recent survey, partly because GE has made it clear that they must cut costs. Producers complain about less indulgence for new news programming, and they worry as much about costs as covering events.    Although the former NBC News President, Lawrence Grossman, wasn't popular, his ouster last week hasn't eased news employees' fears. They expect GE's bottom-line orientation to result in more job cuts and the closing of certain news bureaus. NBC employees are further rankled by Mr. Welch's disregard for tradition; one producer calls &quot;crass&quot; his decision to replace RCA's logo with GE's on the NBC building at Rockefeller Center.    GE's cost consciousness has already cost NBC the Rose Bowl, which went to Capital Cities/ABC Inc., and the 1992 Winter Olympics, which went to CBS Inc. &quot;You have to have those major events, not on a cost basis, but in order to make people feel that this is the place with the big-star entertainment and to get them to bring it to you before&quot; the other networks, a former NBC executive says.    Adds Mr. Tinker, who made NBC the No. 1 network and now runs his own production company in Los Angeles: &quot;My idea of running NBC was to get it up to top speed, make a lot of money and so we spilled a little, who cares? To the extent it becomes just a maximize-the-bottom-line kind of company, some of the air will go out of NBC.&quot;    And although Mr. Welch's big-ticket acquisitions -- RCA and Employers Reinsurance -- dazzled analysts, some diversifications into unfamiliar waters have floundered. So far, Kidder Peabody, rocked by the insider-trading scandal and employee defections, hasn't proved worth the $600 million GE paid for it two years ago. Also unsuccessful were Mr. Welch's two 1981 technology acquisitions, Calma Co., a computer-aided design firm purchased for about $170 million, and Intersil, a semiconductor firm bought for $235 million.    Kidder's problems began in February 1987, when Martin A. Siegel, once its foremost takeover specialist, pleaded guilty to insider-trading charges. &quot;I never would have bought Kidder knowing Marty Siegel was a cheat,&quot; Mr. Welch declares. Although GE avoided criminal charges against Kidder, replacing Kidder's top managers with GE men hurt morale at the securities firm. Then, after the market crashed, Kidder's profits plunged.    Several key executives, complaining about chintzy year-end bonuses, defected. Mr. Welch, defending the bonuses, comments: &quot;Our rules are: 'You deliver, we deliver.'&quot; The nadir came early this year when GE's financial-services arm tried to snatch away a proposed Kidder deal to take Montgomery Ward private. Kidder and the other GE unit ended up winning the business with an innovative proposal -- but with a lot of bruised egos. Only now is Kidder rebuilding its talent pool.    Calma was part of GE's ill-starred foray into factory automation. Like its forecasts of the automation market, GE's estimates of Calma's growth potential were wildly optimistic. Calma's annual losses reached $50 million, and it never made money. GE recently sold a piece of it at a loss. It also wants to sell Intersil.    &quot;If we had never done Calma, we'd be better off,&quot; Mr. Welch concedes, adding: &quot;But if we had a policy of no acquisitions, we never would have touched Employers Reinsurance or RCA or Borg-Warner.&quot;    For the moment, Mr. Welch may be able to ignore his critics. GE's management talent is deep, departed managers say, and Mr. Welch contends that stress and insecurity are greatest in businesses going through cyclical downturns anyway. Moreover, he says, GE must adopt a get-tough culture to survive in the 1990s as global competition intensifies.    Says Robert Smialek, who left medical systems for broader responsibility as group vice president at Tracor Inc., an instruments concern: &quot;If you're looking for a relaxing place to work that leads gradually to retirement, you won't enjoy GE. Not everybody is happy there. But when the supply of management talent so exceeds demand, you can afford to lose people. In the future, that might not be the case. But Jack is agile enough to change his approach when the time comes.&quot;    ---    GE's Strategic Moves   Recent acquisitions and divestitures   of $100 million or more   Acquisitions   1984  -- Buys Employers Reinsurance for $1.1 billion   1986  -- Buys RCA for $6.3 billion         -- Buys 80% of Kidder Peabody for about $600 million   1987  -- Buys Miami television station for $270 million         -- Buys Dandamp;K Financial for $100 million         -- Buys the medical equipment business of Thomson            S.A. of France in exchange for GE consumer            electronics business         -- Buys Gelco Corp. for $250 million   1988  -- Buys Montgomery Ward's credit card operation for            $1 billion and assumption of $1.8 billion in debt         -- Agrees to buy Borg-Warner's plastics business for            $2.3 billion   Divestitures   1983  -- Sells housewares division to Black andamp; Decker for            about $300 million   1984  -- Sells Utah International for $2.4 billion         -- Sells GE Credit's second-mortgage unit for $600            million   1985  -- Sells interest in Australian coal fields for $390            million   1987  -- Sells North American Co. for Life andamp; Health for            $200 million         -- Sells consumer electronics business to Thomson            S.A. in exchange for Thomson's medical equipment            business and cash   1988  -- Sells RCA Global Communications for $160 million         -- Sells five radio stations for $122 million    ---    The Conglomerate that Jack Welch Built    GE's Chairman Has Refashioned the Company   1987 lines of business based on revenues in billions of dollars   Aircraft engines            $6.8   Aerospace                   $5.3   Power systems               $5.0   Industrial                  $4.7   Major appliances            $4.7   Technical systems/services  $3.7   NBC                         $3.2   Consumer electronics a      $3.0   Materials                   $2.8   Other consumer              $2.0   Medical equipment a         $0.8   Financial services          $0.6    a -- On Dec. 31, 1987, GE acquired from Thomson S.A. of France its medical equipment division while Thomson acquired most of GE's consumer electronics business</TEXT></DOC>
