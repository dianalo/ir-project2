Increasingly, German lawmakers are pressing for more international cooperation to avert a recession. The emerging sentiments mark a tentative dilution of Germany's once-unified resistance to pressure from the country's major trading partners, particularly the U.S., that it stimulate its economy for the good of world trade.    To be sure, German policy makers so far have given no public indication that the government or the conservative central bank is entertaining a major shift to more liberal policies, notwithstanding the decline in short-term open-market interest rates engineered by the Bundesbank. Recently, however, the plunge in share prices here, amid fears that the declining dollar could damage the country's export-oriented economy, has many Germans rethinking their positions. Prospects for accelerated tax cuts and a discount-rate reduction no longer are as inconceivable as they once seemed.    &quot;The dollar's latest plunge and the stock-market crash shocked many people in the Federal Republic and caused a general rethinking process,&quot; said Diethard Simmert, a monetary economist for Commerzbank AG. He said that the powerful German industry and banking lobbies, in public and private forums, have been pressuring Bonn in recent weeks for stimulative steps. &quot;This is an interesting shift, and you can already tell that Bonn is beginning to react,&quot; he said. &quot;Suddenly there is talk of doing something after all. Nobody wants to be blamed for doing nothing to prevent a recession, and many in Bonn are getting cold feet.&quot;    Members of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition parties -- the Christian Democratic Union; its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Socialists; and the Free Democrats -- and some Bundesbank officials have started at least thinking about a cut in Germany's discount rate as well as bringing forward and expanding Bonn's tax-reduction package planned for 1990. The discount rate is the fee charged by the central bank on loans to financial institutions.    &quot;We have to be prepared to do something more to stimulate the German economy if it can be coordinated with other countries, particularly the U.S.,&quot; said Hermann-Otto Solms, the senior Free Democrat on the finance committee of the lower house of parliament. Moreover, he said coordination between the Bonn government and the German central bank could stand some improvement.    &quot;Without saying it, the Bundesbank wants to do more but can't move unless flanked by stimulatory steps in Bonn's fiscal policy. You can't move an economy with interest-rate cuts alone,&quot; said Mr. Solms, whose committee this week visited with Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl while conducting a fact-finding tour in Frankfurt. Fiscal steps in Bonn could include an earlier tax reduction, a repeal of the tax on all stock-exchange transactions, and investment incentives for environmental projects, according to Mr. Solms.    Yet economists and politicians always return to the U.S. budget deficit when weighing the chances of tangible German policy shifts. &quot;Those who support more liberal policies here in Germany need a major signal from the U.S. if a change in Bonn is to be politically feasible,&quot; said Mr. Solms. He suggested that anything even remotely approaching the deficit-reduction program set down by the Gramm-Rudman law would be helpful.    Matthias Wissmann, economic-policy spokesman for the Christian Democratic parliamentary faction, this week asserted that more growth-oriented policies are needed to reduce Germany's stubborn unemployment, currently at 9% of the labor force and showing no sign of coming down soon. But &quot;the problem is that only coordinated policies coming out of a G-7 meeting can be enough to help,&quot; he said, in a reference to the group of finance ministers and central bank governors from the world's seven leading democracies who in the past have coordinated policies to help stabilize the international economy.    Among German policy makers, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg is viewed as the most unyielding of opponents to additional moves to stoke Germany's flagging economy, which even before the stockmarket collapse was expected by many economists to grow only about 1.5% this year, without much hope for faster growth next year. &quot;One hears in Bonn that Stoltenberg is the major obstacle against reforms, even though a number of people around Chancellor Kohl are beginning to doubt that the 1990 package (of tax cuts) will have any effect on the economy and whether more should be done sooner,&quot; said Commerzbank's Mr. Simmert.    However, under growing domestic pressure for more economic coordination in international forums, Mr. Stoltenberg this week held out the possibility of a G-7 meeting after a decision on the U.S. budget deficit. Germany would be expected to offer a contribution to any world-wide stimulus package developed at such a meeting.    Mr. Stoltenberg this week received a letter from Martin Bangemann in which the economics minister opposed government spending cuts to help finance the 20 billion-mark ($11.93 billion) tax-reduction package scheduled for 1990. Mr. Bangemann, more flexible but carrying less clout than Mr. Stoltenberg, also held out the option of advancing the date of the tax cuts if a sudden deterioration of the West German economy demanded it. </TEXT></DOC>
