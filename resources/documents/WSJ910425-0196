She sits in on storymeetings, covers press conferences and researches articles.Her first byline will appear in the July issue.   But Ms. Sparta, who graduated from New York University inDecember with a bachelor's degree in journalism, is noordinary junior executive: She is a $6-an-hour intern.</LP><TEXT>   Without her, the magazine's health department would haveto hire a salaried assistant editor, says her boss, healtheditor Nelly Edmondson Gupta. But that's &quot;not in the budget,&quot;Ms. Gupta explains, adding: &quot;The interns have beenlifesavers. We're getting the best and brightest for a verylow rate.&quot;   Tough economic times are changing corporate attitudesabout college interns. Only a few years ago, companies couldafford to design internships around the interns, investingtime and money to squire them through the business, hoping towoo the most promising to full-time employment aftergraduation. Now, as more companies cut their salaried staffs,they are increasingly tapping interns as a source ofinexpensive labor.   In some cases, interns are offered temporary jobs not justfor the summer but for the next three seasons, too. But then,instead of being offered permanent spots, they are replacedby new interns.   For some students, it can be a boon. Instead of scramblingfor a limited number of spaces, they have an easier shot ateven the best firms. And there is the chance to take on realresponsibilities while rubbing shoulders with seasonedprofessionals.   Because many of the interns are supported by financial aidor their parents, they acquiesce to working for little or nopay, no benefits and no promise of a future at the company.Instead, they earn something they say is worth its weight ingold: the name of a Fortune 500 company at the top of theirresume.   &quot;I like to tell my interns this is the best of times andthe worst of times,&quot; says Jason Berger, a communicationsprofessor who oversees an internship program at DuquesneUniversity in Pittsburgh. &quot;It's the worst of times forbusiness, but the best of times for interns. Two or threeyears ago, a lot of {intern} jobs would have been entry-levelpositions.&quot;   Consider the Moody's Investor Service Inc. unit of Dun andamp;Bradstreet Corp. Short-handed, one of its bond departmentsquadrupled the number of so-called ongoing interns -- thosewho work indefinitely -- to eight this year. Among otherthings, the interns help analysts rate bonds.   The extra manpower helps because &quot;we don't necessarilyhave approval to hire more people on a permanent basis,&quot; saysone employee, who calls the arrangement &quot;a cost-effective wayto use staff without increasing head count.&quot;   To be sure, some strapped companies are eliminating orcutting internship programs. Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. still paysbusiness-school finance interns $1,000 a week but has shelvedplans made last fall to start a similar program for collegestudents. &quot;We're kind of coming off a tough year,&quot; says JohnRae, director of recruiting. An intern program &quot;is prettyexpensive and time-consuming,&quot; he says.   For those companies now turning to interns for criticalmanpower, there can be a downside. While the interns areenergetic and motivated, they are, after all, lacking theexperience deemed necessary by some to make major decisions.As long as students simply assist decisionmakers, &quot;I thinkit's a good thing,&quot; says Richard L. Rowan, co-director of theCenter for Human Resources at the Wharton School. But, headds, &quot;if they are indeed being put into real decision-makingjobs, that could cause some problems.&quot;   While more companies are taking chances with inexperiencedinterns, others plug the students into clerical spots or usethem for grunt work. Companies now call &quot;all the time&quot;requesting interns to fetch coffee and make copies, saysTrudy Steinfeld, director of the office of career services atNew York University. &quot;They call the position anadministrative intern, but we won't list it,&quot; she says.   &quot;This is the seedy side of it,&quot; adds Mr. Berger ofDuquesne, who once yanked a student from a marketinginternship that involved tabulating customer-response cards.&quot;Interns shouldn't be used to fill short-term labor needs.&quot;   Some companies say they have no choice in the matter. AtFord Motor Co.'s accounts-payable department, for instance,manager Ronald Fiscus realized he would need extra hands todo work that will be phased out in July by computers. Thework requires little skill because it's highly automated, heexplains.   Lacking permission to hire new workers, or even temporaryones, Mr. Fiscus enlisted the help of six paid studentinterns this semester, double the number of past periods.&quot;We're using them almost as full-time employees,&quot; Mr. Fiscusreports. But he can't hire them, he says; there's a hiringfreeze on.   Eastern Airlines made ample use of interns before itdeclared bankruptcy. Last fall, for instance, it used fiveinterns to help answer calls in a three-person Pittsburghsales office. Maureen Healey, an intern from Duquesne, saysshe enjoyed the work but was relieved when Eastern finallysupplemented the staff with a secretary. &quot;They needed anotheremployee in the office instead of so many interns,&quot; sherecalls.   While Ms. Healey, who has since graduated from Duquesne,says she learned a lot working for a company teetering on thebrink of bankruptcy, most of her duties involved answeringphones. And in the end, she never received her full pay.That's because Eastern paid its interns with one freeround-trip ticket for every 50 hours worked. By the time thecarrier filed for bankruptcy, Ms. Healy had earned fivetickets and used only two. One of her fellow-interns wasstuck with 10 tickets; others had to cancel trips to Cancun.   Overall, the experience was worth it, she says. But sheadds: &quot;It was almost free labor.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
