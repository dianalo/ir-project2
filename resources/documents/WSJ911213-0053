The agency voted 5-0 to allow companies abroad to providephone service to the U.S. through a mechanism called resale.Companies would rent international cable or satellitecircuits and use that capacity to sell phone services tothose who want to call the U.S. But there is a catch, theagency said. Before the FCC would approve such a scheme for acompany in a foreign country, it must be convinced that thecountry would allow similar arrangements for U.S. companies.</LP><TEXT>   In addition, the FCC said it would no longer requirecompanies that are 15% owned by foreign entities to complywith its stiffest level of phone regulation. Instead, it saidit would judge the level of regulation by whether a phonecompany dominates access to a particular market in the sameway that American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. dominates theU.S. long-distance market.   FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes said the plan would help breakup &quot;artificial cost and price regimes.&quot; The agency contendsthat government-owned Postal, Telegraph and TelephoneAdministrations -- PTTs -- jack up the cost of connecting totheir phone networks in order to subsidize postal operations.These phone charges could be cut in half, the FCC maintains,if they reflected actual costs.   Richard Firestone, the chief of the FCC's common carrierbureau, said that phone resellers could undercut theartificially high PTT charges. Competition with theresellers, he said, would eventually cause the PTTs to cuttheir rates. He added that foreign governments will have anincentive to let U.S. companies offer international phoneresale services because that is the only way that foreigncompanies could get a crack at the huge U.S. market.   Apart from these actions, the FCC is trying to reduceinternational rates by jawboning U.S. long-distance companiesto strike better deals with foreign PTTs. In addition, U.S.trade officials are trying to pressure foreign countries toopen their markets to U.S. phone companies in exchange foraccess to the U.S. phone business.   Separately, the FCC voted to allow airline passengers touse cellular phones while their planes are on the ground butnot in the air. The agency said that once the plane isairborne, the cellular phones could interfere with a pilot'sradio communications with the ground. And the agency approveda plan offered by ATandamp;T and MCI Communications Corp. to assurethat their telephone sales representatives don't sign upcustomers without customer permission. Such practices --known in the industry as &quot;slamming&quot; -- have been a big sourceof consumer complaints.</TEXT></DOC>
