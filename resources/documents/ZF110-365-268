 They have a corresponding tendency tobecome overloaded.andP;  Users experience overloading as sluggishness when theytry to print, send E-mail, or access a file server.andP;  Then they complain.andM;If you're a network manager, it's your job to solve these problems.andP;  Thisoften involves redesigning the internetandgt; dividing users into differentgroupsandgt; adding printers, servers, and routers to reduce trafficandgt; and perhapsswitching some users from LocalTalk to Ethernet.andP;  These are expensivesolutions, however, and you don't always have the budget for ahardware-intensive redesign.andP;  In such instances, it's your job as networkmanager to help people learn to accomplish their business and computing goalsby using network resources efficiently.andP;  (Actually, this is a good idea evenif you do have a big hardware budget.)andP;  This month I'll take a look at someof the common ways people use networks inefficiently -- albeit to accomplishvalid business goals -- and I'll suggest some free (or inexpensive) ways toimprove efficiency.andP;  Some of them involve a minor network redesign, butothers rely entirely on changing users' behavior.andM;Editing On-ScreenandM;One of the most important ways people use AppleTalk networks is to sharelaser printers.andP;  Printing is also one of the most abused network services.andO;Users figure: The printer's thereandgt; why not use it?andP;  Then they complain thatthe network is slow.andM;One printing practice I like to discourage is the printing of draft copies ofdocuments.andP;  Novice computer users print drafts the most, because they aren'tused to editing on-screen.andP;  Sometimes you can encourage them to try to domore editing on-screen and use the LaserWriter less.andP;  I jokingly tell themthat I notice that their wastebasket and recycling bin are full of paper andthat a few more trees could stand tall and proud if they got used to editingon-screen.andM;Another reason why people print drafts is that the Mac is not truly a WYSIWYGdevice, because it relies on QuickDraw for screen information and onPostScript for printed output.andP;  Sometimes on-screen items look very differentfrom the same material in print.andP;  To people who want to see how their outputlooks on paper, you might suggest that they use a product such as ATM (AdobeType Manager) that enhances an on-screen image to make it look more likeactual output.andP;  (Version 2.0 of ATM is much faster than its predecessor,making this option a bit more palatable.)andP;  This may reduce the number ofdrafts they need to print.andM;Another practice that strains network resources is printing huge documentsduring the day on shared printers.andP;  Sometimes this can't be helped, but youcan encourage users to do large printing jobs during off-hours.andP;  Sometimesinvesting in a large paper bin makes this more attractive, in that u sersdon't have to contend with adding paper to the 200-page tray that comes with,for example, an Apple LaserWriter IINT.andP;  With a print spooler, users canspecify when a job will get printed.andP;  The cheapest print spooler,PrintMonitor, comes free as part of Mac system software, but it requires thatyou have enough memory to run MultiFinder.andM;Those who use the ASPS (AppleShare Print Server), a network spooler, haveprobably figured out that although ASPS has a lot of benefits, one of thedrawbacks is that all print traffic goes through the network twice -- once toget from your Mac to the spooler and again to get from the spooler to theLaserWriter.andP;  You might try putting your printers onto a different network,which involves running ASPS concurrently with a software router such asapple's Internet Router or Farallon's Liaison (see Figure 1).andM;Don't Print That Message]andM;Another practice I try to discourage is printing E-mail messages.andP;  One of thebenefits of E-mail is that it can reduce the amount of paper in an office,but printing messages negates this advantage.andP;  Each time a message isprinted, it has to be transmitted over the network twice if you use a networkspooler.andP;  An E-mail message sent to 20 people and printed by 10 shouldprobably have been photocopied.andM;But did all ten of those people really need to print the message?andP;  I've heardusers give two main reasons for printing their E-mail.andP;  The first is thatthey want to keep a record of their correspondence so that they canreconstruct the paper trail that led to a decision or action.andP;  A reasonablegoal, but you may be able to reduce network traffic if you can provide anelectronic alternative to paper trails.andP;  Some E-mail packages such as QuickMail let you create electronic folders in which you can store old messages.andO;If users on your network take advantage of this feature, encourage them toalso avail themselves of another feature your E-mail program may have: theability to store mail messages on a local hard disk, rather than on the mailserver.andP;  Rereading a message stored on the server adds network traffic.andM;I use a message-storing database created in HyperCard.andP;  I wrote a customscript that creates the text of a message and copies it to the appropriatefields of a card in my mailkeeper stack (see Figure 2).andP;  I use KnowledgeSet'sHyperKRS as the basis of a script that searches my stack for cards that matchthe keywords I specify.andP;  This method works much better for me than keepingthe messages in electronic or paper folders.andM;Another reason people give for printing their E-mail messages is that theyare only in the office for a short time each day and they want to be able toread them later.andP;  Remote access to the mail server might be a worthwhilealternative for such users.andP;  Perhaps they already have a computer and modernat home or can borrow the necessary equipment from their company.andP;  Using aremote computer lets them respond electronically to messages as they readthem.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
