Right after President Reagan vetoed the 1,000-page bill, saying he'd sign it if stripped of plant closings, the Democrats announced they'd abandoned the bill and will campaign against the Republicans from now till November on the plant-closings issue. What about the other 999 pages? The Republicans have been had. Many of them went over to the Democrats' side. Now the Democrats plan to shoot their prisoners. We don't expect many Republicans to realize they've been scammed but we wonder about the PACs and lobbyists. Many showered cash contributions on these congressmen only to discover the whole thing, unsurprisingly, was just another incumbent-protection ploy. They could have spent this money on soup kitchens or something deserving, rather than feeding it to the insatiable re-election monster called Congress. </TEXT></DOC>
