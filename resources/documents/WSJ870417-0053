Gen. Richard Secord can't be compelled to release records of foreign bank accounts to the Senate committee investigating the Iran-Contra scandal.    District Judge Aubrey Robinson Jr. ruled that the committee's effort to force Gen. Secord to sign a document turning over records of bank accounts in Switzerland, Panama and the Cayman Islands to congressional investigators would violate Gen. Secord's constitutional protection against self-incrimination.    A spokesman for the committee said &quot;we intend to seek an expedited appeal.&quot; But Senate and House investigators have said that regardless of how the legal battle is resolved, they hope to obtain much of the same information from other sources.    &quot;The committee has candidly stated,&quot; Judge Robinson said in his nine-page decision, that it seeks to &quot;obtain (Gen.) Secord's foreign bank records for use in its investigation into his allegedly criminal activities.&quot; Although three federal appeals courts have upheld the legality of the methods used by the committee, Judge Robinson concluded that it &quot;would be completely ignoring reality . . . to say that (Gen.) Secord's signature&quot; on the document prepared by the committee wouldn't be &quot;potentially incriminating.&quot;    The Senate initiated contempt proceedings against Gen. Secord after he refused to consent to release of the records. Albert Hakim, a business partner of Gen. Secord who is expected to cooperate with the committee under a grant of limited immunity, is believed to have access to many of the same records.    Judge Robinson's ruling didn't address efforts by Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel investigating the Iran-Contra affair, to obtain information from any Swiss bank accounts controlled by Gen. Secord and some of his associates. Mr. Walsh, invoking a U.S.-Swiss treaty, asked the Swiss government for access to the records, but legal proceedings and appeals stemming from that request could delay a decision for months.    Congressional investigators have said they don't have authority to use procedures spelled out in the treaty. Lawyers for the Senate committee told Judge Robinson on Tuesday that investigators believe that the accounts were used in secret sales of U.S. arms to Iran and the suspected diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan rebels, or Contras.    Congressional and criminal investigators haven't indicated any plan to grant immunity to Gen. Secord, although sources said they have granted immunity to three of his former business associates. </TEXT></DOC>
