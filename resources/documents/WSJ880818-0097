Both a lawyer for Schiavone and a spokesman for Time Inc. said yesterday that the proposed settlement is being circulated among the parties for signatures. Neither side would disclose the terms of the settlement, but the reporter on the stories, Sandy Smith, said he was told that Time Inc. will pay a total of $500,000 to the plaintiffs.    Mr. Smith, who wasn't a defendant in the libel suits, said he provided material in 1982 for the articles that quoted a Federal Bureau of Investigation memorandum as saying, &quot;The name of Schiavone appeared several times in the {FBI's} reports on the 1975 disappearance of former Teamster boss Jimmy Hoffa.&quot;    The chairman of Schiavone, Ronald Schiavone, filed suit against Time for omitting a phrase from the FBI memo that read, &quot;None of these {appearances in the Hoffa files} suggested any criminality, or organized crime associations.&quot; Mr. Schiavone and two employees of his company filed a similar suit against Fortune, which is owned by Time Inc.    The articles questioned the FBI's withholding of its information on Schiavone as it related to Raymond Donovan, a Schiavone employee who became U.S. Labor Secretary. Mr. Donovan resigned after his indictment on grand larceny and other charges, but was found innocent after trial. The charges weren't related to the Hoffa matter.    Mr. Smith, who is retired from Time, said Time Inc. associate general counsel Robert Marshall Jr. informed him of the settlement Aug. 3, about 2 1/2 months after the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia ruled that the libel case against Time should go to trial.    &quot;Marshall explained it to me that they didn't want to try it,&quot; Mr. Smith said. &quot;The basic feeling was that it was another Sharon spectacle,&quot; a reference to the highly publicized libel suit brought against Time by former Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon.    Mr. Smith was infuriated by the settlement, calling it &quot;disgraceful, shameful.&quot; &quot;If I had been a defendant, I wouldn't have settled,&quot; he said. According to Mr. Smith, Mr. Marshall said the suit would be settled by paying Mr. Schiavone $450,000; the company, $48,000; and $1,000 to each of the two employees. Mr. Marshall is on vacation and couldn't be reached for comment.    Mr. Schiavone's lawyer, Theodore Geiser of Roseland, N.J., said yesterday that he hadn't yet filed motions to dismiss the libel cases but that he has informed the judges that settlements are in the offing.    A spokesman for Time Inc. said yesterday he wouldn't comment on the terms of the settlements, including whether the magazines would publish corrections or retractions of the articles. </TEXT></DOC>
