Opening a meeting of foreign ministers of the 46-memberOrganization of Islamic Conference, the Jordanian monarch alsoexpressed hope that Iran would agree to a cease-fire in its warwith Iraq.   The Iranian envoy to the conference, Mohammed Ali Tashkiri, toldreporters that his nation would accept the help of any ``truthfulhand'' that tried to end the devastating Iran-Iraq missile duel oneach other's cities.   At the United Nations Monday, Iraq's U.N. ambassador accusedIraq of using chemical weapons which he said killed 5,000 peopleand wounded 5,000 in Kurdish border cities inside Iran.   King Hussein told the conference in his opening address: ``ThePalestinian people have a rightful claim on us to support theiruprising both on the national and international level so that theuprising (in the occupied territories) may bear fruit.''   The king did not elaborate on what forms aid should take, butasked the ministers to support an international conference onMiddle East peace.   Sharifuddin Pir Zadeh, secretary-general of the Islamicconference, said earlier that protesters in the Israeli-occupiedterritories should be supported ``financially and morally.''   Hussein said the Palestinian were ``heroically fighting fortheir freedom and national rights and defying in their uprising thearrogance of the forces of occupation.''   He said there should be a seat for the Palestine LiberationOrganization at an international peace conference, which wouldinvolve the parties to the conflict and the five permanent membersof the U.N. Security Council: the United States, Soviet Union,Britain, France and China.   By calling for a PLO seat at the conference, Hussein set himselfapart from U.S. peace proposals, which he discussed in Amman onSunday with U.S. envoy Philip Habib. The U.S. plan does not callfor a PLO seat at the conference.   ``The uprising of the Palestinian people is not an end in itselfnor is it a transient coincidental event that will soon witheraway,'' Hussein said. ``It is rather an expression of the will ofan entire nation to fight for its freedom and right ofself-determination in its own land.''   The rebellion in the occupied territories, which Palestinianscall ``the uprising,'' and the Iran-Iraq war dominate the agenda ofthe meeting, at which all members of the Conference except Chad arerepresented.   King Hussein, who supports Iraq in the war, called the conflicta ``deep wound in the body'' of the Moslem world that is ``bleedingand draining our resources and energies.''   ``Our hope is that Iran ... will accept Security CouncilResolution 598, which represents the will of the internationalcommunity,'' he said.   The resolution, passed last July, provides for a cease-fire andreturn to pre-war borders.   Iraq has said it will stop shooting if Iran does but theIranians demand that Iraq be named the aggressor before a trucetakes effect. Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after severalborder skirmishes.   Tashkiri, who heads the foreign relations department in Iran'sMinistry of Information and Religious Guidance, told journaliststhat he would attempt to get the conference to discuss the missileduel.   ``We support a halt in the war of the cities and we will backany truthful hand that tries to stop it,'' he said.   The relatively low-ranking level of the Iranian delegation inAmman appeared to make it unlikely such negotiations would start atthe conference.   Iran's U.N. ambassador, Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati, accused Iraqof sending planes to bombard border cities with nerve gas on ascale ``unprecedented'' in the Persian Gulf war, and also ofemploying mustard gas and cyanide gas in a campaign that beganMarch 17.   Iraq's ambassador, Ismat Taha Kittani, refused comment.   Mahallatti asked the U.N. Security Council to denounce Iraq, tosend a fact-finding team to verify his claims and to mobilize theWorld Health Organization and similar agencies to aid victims.</TEXT></DOC>
