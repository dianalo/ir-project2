The Sandinistas, in their newspaper Barricada, called oncitizens to prepare for ideological warfare to defend the rulingparty against the Contras. The Contras hinted that if peacefulmeasures don't bring about democratic reforms, they are preparedtake up arms again.   A Defense Ministry spokesman said there were no reports ofcombat on Friday, five days after the two sides agreed to suspendoffensive operations.   The temporary truce began at the start of three days of talksthat ended with the signing of the plan Wednesday night. Under thepact, guns will remain silent until June 1, when a permanentcease-fire is to take effect.   In addition to its regular edition, Barricada distributed aspecial four-page edition Friday praising the pact that outlinessteps to end the war, which has lasted more than six years.   Barricada's regular edition said that with the agreement, thewar will take on a new phase.   ``On an internal political level, this means the incorporationof pressure groups, that even though disarmed, continue to be armedideologically against the popular power and its conquests,'' itsaid in an editorial.   ``This implies that while the warlike battles lessen or stop,the fight enters a new phase of political-ideological battles.   ``The people should be ready for the new step to reach totalpeace, the continuation and the strengthening of the revolution andthe power of the Sandinistas,'' it added.   It ran a front-page caricature of President Reagan dressed as amagician and reaching into an empty high-top hat. The magician'srabbit, with the word ``Sapoa'' written on its chest, sat onReagan's head.   The cease-fire talks were held at the customs post outside theborder village of Sapoa, 90 miles south of the capital.   Jorge Rosales, a Contra spokesman in Miami, said the Sandinistassigned the cease-fire agreement ``because of the pressure _military and political _ put on them by the (Nicaraguan)Resistance,'' as the rebels are formally known.   ``The Resistance has been proposing this type of agreement since1983 but the only response we had from them was insults,'' he said.   But Rosales indicated that if democracy is not reached with thecease-ire agreement that the Contras would renew their armed fight.   ``If we can't do it peacefully, if the Sandinsitas do not wantto achieve democracy, then the reasons Nicaraguans took up armswill still be there,'' he said.   The rebels' Radio Liberacion quoted Contra leader Adolfo Caleroas saying ``the signed truce doesn't mean we have abandoned ourfight (for democracy) in Nicaragua.''   ``Our first way is peaceful, but this does not exclude othermeans if we are obligated to do so,'' he said.   Contra sources have indicated that Congress' rejection of newaid to them in February was the major reason for signing theagreement. The other was that the Sandinistas reportedly told therebels the talks were the last chance to end the war.   The Sandinistas are banking on the Reagan administration's lameduck status continuing to thwart its efforts to get new Contra aid.   At the same time, they made some concessions to reach theagreement, which could ease severe internal problems that revolvearound the draft, economic policies and the chronic shortages offood and basics.   The Contras have been backed by the United States since 1981 intheir fight to oust the Sandinistas, who came to power in a popularrevolutionary war. Government opponents say they promised democracyand delivered Marxism.   Under the cease-fire agreement, the government will grant agradual political amnesty and full press freedoms. The Contras mayreceive only non-lethal aid and it must be distributed by a neutralorganization. All political exiles can return.   A United Nations delegation went to the border with Nicaraguafor a second day Friday. It was invited by the Sandinistas to proveits troops had not crossed into Honduran territory during aneight-day offensive that ended March 16 to rout Contras from basecamps.   Defense sources said Thursday the Sandinista army has pulledpatrols from mountainous jungle regions in war zones to placeswhere there are less likely to be clashes with the Contras.   The Reagan administration and the Honduran government have citedan incursion by 2,000 Sandinista as the reason for sending U.S.troops into Honduras last week.   Nicaraguan soldiers in the border region of thick jungle,mountains and a maze of rivers indicated they had crossed the CocoRiver dividing the two nations.   The Sandinista offensive pushed about 1,800 rebels back intoHonduras, according to the government. Military sources indicatedthat the low number of battlefield deaths, put at 92 by theSandinista army, did not mark a victory for government troops.</TEXT></DOC>
