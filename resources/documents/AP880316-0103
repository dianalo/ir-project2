ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Democrats are searching anew for apresidential front-runner after the home-state revival of Sen. PaulSimon, who declared today he has ``as good a shot as anybody''after his victory over Jesse Jackson in the Illinois primary.George Bush won easily in the Republican contest, although he stillhad to contend with a battered but dogged Bob Dole.   The candidates went on spring break today after a grueling monththat featured 20-odd primaries and caucuses in both parties.   ``This is the state, it will be remembered, which locked it upfor George Bush,'' Gov. James Thompson said after Illinoisshattered Dole's comeback bid and brought Bush two-thirds of theway to a GOP nominating majority.   The Democrats had no luxury to talk of locking up anything. Therace for a nominating majority of delegates was a dead heat betweenJackson and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis with Kansas andMichigan next up on the calendar.   However, Dukakis was expecting to pick up about 100 uncounteddelegates from caucuses already held in Minnesota, Texas andWashington state.   ``Now we move on to Michigan,'' said Dukakis, ``where there areno favorite sons. The field is wide open.''   Jackson, in an interview on NBC-TV today, congratulated Simon onhis victory but in almost the same breath seemed to dismiss it asIllinois voters paying ``respects to a sitting senator'' who hadfocused on his home state while Jackson was competing in the SuperTuesday states.   Simon, on the other hand, said on ABC-TV that his Illinois winshowed he is in the thick of a battle that will go all the way tothe Democratic National Convention this summer.   ``I don't know who out there will emerge, but I think Paul Simonhas as good a shot as anyone,'' he said.   Simon said in several interviews that his relative lack ofcampaign money wasn't a big problem, though he concluded hisappearance on CBS-TV by saying with a smile, ``Any of your viewerswho want to send in a contribution, I'll be happy to accept it.''   ``I don't believe we have any front-runners,'' Dukakis saidafter finishing what he described as ``a respectable third'' inIllinois. He said in his discussions with Democratic Party leadersaround the country ``there is an overwhelming sentiment that weshould get behind a nominee.''   Jackson finished second in the duel of favorite sons, and said,``Jesse Jackson, in popular vote and delegates, is on top of therace.''   In fact, the Associated Press delegate survey showed Dukakiswith 464.5 and Jackson with 460.55. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had 354.8;Rep. Richard Gephardt 145, and Simon 171.5 delegates.   The big losers in Illinois were Republicans Dole and PatRobertson and Democrats Gore and Gephardt.   ``We're staying in,'' said Dole after absorbing another beatingat the hands of the vice president.   ``Illinois has spoken loud and clear and strong,'' said Bush,who now has won 18 straight primaries _ 16 of them one week ago onSuper Tuesday.   There was relatively little campaign activity today, after fivefrantic weeks in which nearly half the delegates to the Democraticand Republican conventions were chosen.   Gephardt was campaigning in Michigan and Gore was in Kansas.Dukakis had an appearance scheduled in New York, but the rest ofthe candidates were off the campaign trail.   Kansas Democrats hold caucuses this weekend and both partieshave primaries scheduled Saturday in Puerto Rico.   Next Tuesday, the only event in the presidential struggle is aprimary to select the seven delegates allocated to Democrats abroad.   The next major battleground for the Democrats was Michigan,which holds party caucuses on March 26.   Gephardt made little effort in Illinois, pinning his hopes onMichigan with its strong union vote.   But Gore spent about $200,000 on advertising in Illinois andended up with only 5 percent of the vote. Yet, he insisted, therewould be better days ahead. ``This race has a long way to runyet,'' said the Tennessee senator.   For the Republicans, the next big test was Connecticut, with aprimary on March 29. That should produce another big win for Bush,who grew up in the state, which his father represented in the U.S.Senate.   There were two presidential votes in Illinois _ a non-bindingpopularity contest and the election of convention delegates.   Bush and Simon were the big winners in both.   With nearly all the votes counted, Bush was getting about 54percent of the popular vote and winning 66 delegates. Dole wasreceiving 36 percent of the vote, and winning 16 delegates.Robertson was getting 7 percent of the vote and no delegates.   Simon, running stronger than expected, was getting 43 percent ofthe popular vote and picking up 136 delegates. Jackson wasreceiving 31 percent of the vote and 37 delegates, while Dukakiswas getting 17 percent of the vote, but no delegates. Gore andGephardt trailed with 5 percent and 2 percent of the voterespectively, and no delegates.   Good news for Dukakis came from far-away Washington state, whereDemocratic officials released results from 65 percent of theirMarch 8 caucuses. Dukakis led with 45 percent of the vote, to 35percent for Jackson and 14 percent uncommitted. Simon had 4percent. Overall, Washington will send 65 delegates to the nationalconvention.   Robertson said he'd have to reassess his candidacy _ thepolitical euphemism for preparing to drop out _ if he got less than5 percent of the vote in Illinois. He got 7 percent, but hasstopped talking about being the 1988 GOP nominee.   Simon declared, ``This is a new beginning for the Paul Simoncandidacy.''</TEXT></DOC>
