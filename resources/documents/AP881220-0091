In a speech opening two days of Central Committee debate on theparty's role, Jaruzelski urged top-level personnel changes and saidthe party is determined to remove ``all remnants of Stalinism'' andembrace ``everything that is consistent with the spirit andrealities of the time.''   ``We have to remove this damned wall that separates the partyfrom the young generation,'' he said, speaking unusually bluntly fora party leader.   However, he also said the communist Polish United Workers Party``is and will remain the key political force of socialist Poland.''   In his speech, Jaruzelski appeared to confirm that changes in theparty leadership were in store. Diplomatic and party sources hadsaid the meeting might result in the replacement of some olderPolitburo members with younger, vigorous party activists.   ``Serious personnel reconstruction of the party leadership'' isneeded for the ``great work ahead of us,'' Jaruzelski said.   ``The party functioning in a new, effective way will undoubtedlybe a more dynamic promoter of ... national agreement. There are notaboo subjects. We are open for brave searchings and unconventional,compromise solutions.''   Earlier, government spokesman Jerzy Urban had said the plenum ofthe 230-member Central Committee was to give ``important impulses infavor of reconciliation'' and help end the deadlock over launchingformal talks with the opposition.   Plans to hold the talks stalled after Solidarity leader LechWalesa demanded that the government clearly signal its willingnessto legalize the trade union federation banned in 1982, a year afterauthorities imposed martial law.   Urban told reporters today that ``prospects of the (talks) arenot bad, since we are noting an improvement in the internalclimate.''   On Sunday, Walesa formally organized a 128-member citizenscommittee, whose purpose is to act as a united voice for oppositionviews on Poland's social and political problems.   The Central Committee meeting brings together top party leadersto debate proposed reforms contained in the 30-page documentprepared by the Politburo.   ``We are ready to develop dialogue and look for new forms ofagreement and cooperation with the opposition,'' the document says,adding the party can cooperate with any opposition group that``respects the country's constitution and considers its supremevalues the good of the nation and state.''   In a negative reference to Solidarity, the document says:   ``We will always oppose attempts to use the trade union movementfor political manipulations and to transform plants intobattlegrounds.''   It appears to rule out the existence of new political parties orlegalizing Solidarity, but it takes a generally conciliatory stancetoward the opposition.   The document endorses public ownership of much of the economy,maintaining Poland's alliances within the Soviet bloc and preservingthe Communist Party's ``leading role.''</TEXT></DOC>
