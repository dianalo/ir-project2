The FDA dismissed two of four arguments the biotechnologyconcern and its marketing partner, Chugai-Upjohn Inc.,submitted to the agency in favor of FDA marketing approval oftheir version of erythropoietin, or EPO, an anti-anemia drug,the company said. While &quot;disappointing,&quot; the FDA decisiondoesn't block other ways the companies are pursuing to winapproval for the drug, said Gabriel Schmergel, GeneticsInstitute's president and chief executive officer.</LP><TEXT>   Genetics Institute has been counting on EPO,biotechnology's biggest selling drug, to become one of itsmain revenue sources during the next few years. After the FDAdecision was announced, the company's stock dropped sharplyyesterday in over-the-counter trading, closing at $37.75,down $1.75.   &quot;It was only a minor to moderate setback&quot; for GeneticsInstitute, said Robert Kupor, an analyst with Kidder Peabody.&quot;But the background of war&quot; threats in the Mideastintensified the Wall Street fallout from it.   Genetics Institute and Chugai-Upjohn are urging the FDA toapprove their version of EPO despite the agency's previousgranting of exclusive marketing rights to a competing versionof the drug, developed by Amgen Inc., under the federalOrphan Drug Act. Both Amgen and Johnson andamp; Johnson, which haslicensed certain rights to Amgen's drug, have received FDAapproval to sell it in the U.S.   In order to encourage companies to develop drugs for rareconditions, the federal Orphan Drug law allows such concernsseven years of exclusive marketing rights to the drugs. In a&quot;citizens petition&quot; to the FDA, Genetics Institute arguedthat EPO's market for kidney dialysis and other anemicpatients is much larger than intended by Congress for orphandrugs -- analysts estimate sales of Amgen's EPO totaled about$275 million last year. But the FDA denied the company'srequest that EPO's orphan drug status be rescinded based onthe argument, Genetics Institute said.</TEXT></DOC>
