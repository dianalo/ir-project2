The Chapter 7 petition, filed Thursday in U.S. Bankruptcy Courtin Delaware, also asks that a trustee be appointed to oversee thecompany and ``bring any appropriate suit against any third partiesresponsible'' for SCI's condition.   SCI Television, controlled by businessman George Gillett and thebuyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., has beenstruggling under the weight of heavy junk bond borrowing incurredin its $1.3 billion buyout in 1987.   It missed payments of principal and interest last month, andproposed a restructuring under which bondholders would be given a39 percent equity stake in the company in exchange for some debtforgiveness.   In a statement, the Denver-based SCI called the filing ``anunfortunate diversion'' from its talks with other bondholders aboutthe restructuring.   It said the filing ``will not in any way impair or affect theoperations'' of its TV subsidiaries nor does it affect Gillett'sinterest under a separate company of the Vail and Beaver Creek skiareas.   A Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition would require SCI Television tosell off its assets to satisfy creditors. SCI has 20 days torespond to the petition.   SCI Television owns WSBK-TV in Boston, WJBK-TV in Detroit,WJW-TV in Cleveland, WAGA-TV in Atlanta, KNSD-TV in San Diego andWITI-TV in Milwaukee.   The petition was filed on behalf of the investment firm S.N.Phelps andamp; Co., based in Greenwich, Conn., and two individuals whosaid SCI Television failed to pay scheduled interest last month onabout $180,000 in bonds that they hold.   SCI said in its statement that the missed interest payments tothe three creditors amounted to less than $15,000.   The filing came hours after the end of a 30-day grace period forSCI to find a way to pay an Oct. 15 interest payment or restructureits debt.   The company said it has had ``constructive discussions'' aboutits proposed restructuring with a bondholders steering committeeand other bondholders who represent 95 percent of the company'spublic debt. The three creditors filing the petition were not amongthose involved in the talks, it said.   A lawyer for the petitioners, I. Walton Bader, said his clientsfeel the TV stations should be sold because a liquidation couldgenerate more value than a reorganization of the company or arestructuring of its debt.   SCI Television was once part of Storer Communications, a companyacquired in a leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis in 1985. TheStorer TV stations were sold in a second deal for $1.3 billion in1987.   Gillett owns about 55 percent of SCI Television and Kohlbergowns the rest.</TEXT></DOC>
