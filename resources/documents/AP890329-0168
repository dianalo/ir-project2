ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former Justice Department official testifiedat Oliver North's trial Wednesday that in the early frantic searchfor facts about the Iran-Contra affair, no one bothered to ask theboss _ President Reagan _ about a possibly illegal 1985 armsshipment to Iran.   ``Did anybody think to ask this man whether he approved thetransfer of missiles?'' asked North's lawyer Brendan Sullivan,pointing to an easel where he had written in 2-inch-high letters:``PRES.''   ``The questioning of the president was going to come after wehad questioned everybody else,'' said Charles Cooper, a former topaide to then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III.   Sullivan's intense cross-examination of Cooper underscored thedefense's effort to have the former president appear in court totestify for the former White House aide. North has subpoenaedReagan but U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell has not ruledwhether he will enforce the summons.   Reagan's lawyer filed a paper with the court Wednesday insistingthat North's defenders say precisely why they want him as a witnessand what questions they will ask.   The Justice Department filed court papers seeking to quashNorth's subpoena for Reagan's appearance, suggesting writteninterrogatories as an alternative.   ``Unlike any other citizen, a President and a former Presidentboth have a duty to protect the Presidency and to assure thatnational security and international pece are not compromisedunnecessarily,'' said the department. ``Because ... it is he whospeaks for the nation, any hurried statement and any answer to asurprise question pose a risk to the nation.''   The department said the court ``should consider whether answersto written interrogatories would provide'' North ``with all of theessential facts necessary to a fair trial.''   The issue of whether Reagan administration officials knew thatHawk missiles were aboard a November 1985 flight to Iran was raisedat a Nov. 20 1986 White House meeting attended by Cooper, NationalSecurity Adviser John Poindexter and his aide, North; CIA directorWilliam Casey and CIA official Robert Gates, Cooper said. Meese wasthere for part of the meeting.   Cooper said the topic was testimony Casey was to give the nextday to the House Intelligence Committee. Cooper said North proposedthat Casey say no one in the U.S. government knew that the shipmentcontained arms.   Cooper said he learned after the meeting that Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz remembered hearing about the Hawk shipment a yearearlier and telephoned Meese about the discrepancy.   After Cooper did some follow-up work by talking to people at theCIA, wasn't it time to ask Reagan about the November 1985 shipment,Sullivan asked the witness.   ``I don't know whether it was time to do so, but we did not doso,'' Cooper said.   Reagan was asked by the Tower commission what he rememberedabout the shipment in which U.S.-made Hawks were flown from Israelto Iran in an attempt to gain freedom for five American hostagesheld in Lebanon.   The commission, headed by former Republican Sen. John Tower ofTexas, quoted Reagan as saying he objected to the shipment and as aresult, the Hawks were returned to Israel. However, in anothermeeting with the commission, Reagan said he could not remember anymeeting or conversation in general about Hawks and that he did notrecall anything about calling back the missiles.   In the filing with the court Wednesday, Reagan attorney TheodoreB. Olson said he wants to know from North ``the specific evidencesought by him from the former president'' _ and whether it isinformation essential for his defense and not available from other``less intrusive means.''   Under an order issued by Gesell, North submitted to the judge asealed statement of what testimony he wants from Reagan. But, Olsonsaid in a filing with the court, he hasn't been allowed to see itand therefore can't respond.   Meese, one of the last prosecution witnesses, wound up histestimony Wednesday, his second day on the stand. He was the 25thprosecution witness in the trial, now in its ninth week.   It was because of discrepancies over the 1985 shipment, Reaganauthorized Meese on Nov. 21, 1986 to conduct a fact-findinginquiry, which led to the discovery in North's office the next daythat Iran arms sale money had been siphoned to help the Contras.   Meese said he summoned North to his office on Nov. 23, a Sunday.The former attorney general testified that after twice urging Northto tell the truth _ the national security aide withheld criticaldetails about the diversion.   North is charged with falsely telling Meese that the NationalSecurity Council had no involvement with the diversion and thatIsrael, a conduit for the arms, actually determined the amount ofmoney funneled to the Contras. In fact, North and other U.S.officials were directing the secret operation, investigators laterdetermined.   Meese testified that North did not mention the involvement ofco-defendants Richard Secord or Albert Hakim in the affair. And heacknowledged that North hadn't mentioned the role of Swiss-basedattorney Willard Zucker, who set up dummy companies for theIran-Contra operation.   The ex-attorney general also said North hadn't mentioned how theprice of the arms sold to Iran had been marked up by 270 percent,with some of the excess going to the Contras.   Although the judge has not indicated whether he will directReagan to comply with a subpoena issued by North's lawyers _ whichwould be an unprecedented appearance for a former president _Gesell has made a number of courtroom references to a possibleReagan appearance. At one point, he said preparations should bemade in the event Reagan should appear.   And while Meese was testifying, Gesell stopped a question aboutReagan's opinion, saying: ``You've asked to have the presidenthere. He's coming, he knows what his views were.''   Whether that Reagan appearance would be in person or merely onvideotape is one of many issues concerning Reagan yet to beresolved.   Prosecutors already have the former president's answers towritten questions and Gesell ordered the attorneys Wednesday to saywhether they object to providing those to North.</TEXT></DOC>
