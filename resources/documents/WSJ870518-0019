A PTL official with access to IRS worksheets told the Post that between 1981 and 1983, the Bakkers charged PTL for $1.3 million in what IRS auditors have questioned as apparently personal expenses.    PTL officials also said Mr. Bakker controlled separate -- and secret -- ministry accounts to funnel large cash advances to himself and two top aides, the Post said.    The items under IRS scrutiny that were charged to PTL include a Hawaiian holiday for the Bakkers and guests in December 1980, shortly after the sexual tryst with Jessica Hahn that led to Jim Bakker's resignation.    The Bakkers stayed in a $350-a-night suite and bought the Gucci briefcase, a $120 Gucci pen, a $74 toilet kit and a $70 address book -- all paid from donations to PTL, the Post reported.    The IRS audit is in addition to one being conducted by outside auditors called in by the Rev. Jerry Falwell's new management of PTL.    PTL stands for &quot;Praise the Lord&quot; and &quot;People That Love.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
