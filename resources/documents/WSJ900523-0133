The measure, passed on voice vote, would lift the ban onmanufacturing contained in the consent decree that broke upthe Bell system. Only Sen. Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii) opposedthe bill in a brief discussion prior to the vote.</LP><TEXT>   But the legislation, introduced by Commerce CommitteeChairman Ernest F. Hollings (D., S.C.), doesn't touch consentdecree restrictions on the Bells entering computerizedinformation services and the long-distance industry. And in aprovision the Bells find onerous, the measure stipulates thatmanufacturing is to take place within the U.S. from U.S.-madeparts. The bill leaves policing largely up to the FederalCommunications Commission, and gives the FCC authority towaive the &quot;domestic content&quot; requirement if a phone companycan prove &quot;extraordinary circumstances.&quot;   In addition, the measure requires the Bells to obtain aportion of the financing for their manufacturing venturesfrom outside investors.   The Bells' reaction was restrained. &quot;It is an importantfirst step in the process,&quot; said Laird Walker, head of U SWest Inc.'s Washington office and the chairman of an informalBell committee that has been working to lift the antitrustrestrictions. &quot;The domestic content language still needswork,&quot; he said.   Nevertheless, with a busy schedule and little time left toconsider complex telecommunications legislation, there isonly a slim chance that &quot;free-the-Bells&quot; legislation willpass both the Senate and the House this year. For starters,the Commerce Committee bill could be delayed by a possibleJudiciary Committee review or Finance Committee concerns overits implications for international trade. Last week, Sen.Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), chairman of the JudiciaryCommittee's antitrust panel expressed concern about theHollings measure.   Meanwhile, key House members would like to see a morecomprehensive package that would allow the Bells to enterinformation services. The Energy and Commerce Committee'stelecommunications panel has been circulating a staff draftof legislation, trying to get consensus on a measure thatcould move quickly.   The vote comes after six years of intensive lobbying bythe regional phone companies to lift all restrictions in theconsent decree. This year alone, the Bells budgeted $21million for a lobbying and advertising blitz aimed atupsetting the decree.</TEXT></DOC>
