<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-24-0255 </DOCNO><TEXT>Electrochemistry, officially a branch of physical chemistry, is an interdisciplinaryfield bordering on biology, physics, metallurgy and other fields of engineering.This glossary and dictionary presents information and basic knowledgeon recent developments in electrochemistry, i.e. fuel cells, corrosion,energy conversion, electrode kinetics, ion-selective electrodes, andbioelectrochemistry. The user is given a short and precise definitionof each term, its importance in different fields of science and, in caseof measuring units, a description of the method of measurement. Electrochemicaland thermodynamic equations are presented without formal proof, but withan indication of their applications and limitations. Access to relevantinformation is facilitated by drawings and tables. Bibliographic dataare many, and SI units are used throughout the book. A dictionary inthe annex makes it easier for the user to find English-language literature.The book may be a useful reference book for biologists, microbiologists,biochemists, chemists, pharmacists, geologists, physicists, technicians,and especially metallurgists.</TEXT></DOC>
