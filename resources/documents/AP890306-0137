Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevarndadze's proposals went farbeyond the reductions NATO plans to suggest at conventional armstalks that begin Thursday.   A U.S. official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity,said Shevardnadze's purpose in proposing the missile talks was ``tosee whether possible fissures in the alliance could be developed.''   ``I wouldn't characterize it as one of the most positivecharacteristics'' of Shevardnadze's speech, the official said.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told 35 foreign ministersgathered in a baroque palace that the West's goal, at leastinitially, is to reduce the Warsaw Pact's current advantage inconventional forces.   Estimates vary but give the Soviet-led alliance at least a 2-1advantage in tanks.   ``The Warsaw Pact's conventional military preponderance,especially in the spearheads of attack, is what makes an invasionpossible,'' Baker said.   He urged Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to implement the``new thinking'' that guides economic and political reform in theSoviet Union by renouncing the Brezhnev Doctrine ``beyond any shadowof a doubt.''   That doctrine permits military intervention in a Soviet bloccountry in the event of a liberal insurrection. The late PresidentLeonid I. Brezhnev introduced it after the Red Army crushed theliberal ``Prague Spring'' of 1968 in Czechoslovakia.   ``Those in the East should be free of the fear that armed Sovietintervention, justified by the Brezhnev Doctrine, would be usedagain to deny them choice,'' Baker said.   He also said Australia would organize a conference to prevent thespread of chemical weapons and the Bush administration was exploringways to speed the removal of U.S. chemical weapons from West Germany.   Baker added, however: ``Unilateral action is not enough. TheSoviet Union has enormous stocks of chemical weapons threateningEurope. We therefore call on the Soviets to join us, to acceleratethe destruction of their enormous stockpile of these frighteningweapons.''   In Bonn, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said: ``I welcome this intentionto explore ways for the early removal of chemical weapons from theFederal Republic.''   Kohl's chief spokesman, Friedhelm Ost, said earlier Bakertelephoned the chancellor Saturday night and told him the aging U.S.chemical weapons would be withdrawn by 1992.   Shevardnadze countered a NATO proposal to retire at least 25,000Warsaw Pact tanks, then reduce armor, artillery and personnelcarriers on both sides by 5-10 percent with a three-phase plan forradical cuts.   The foreign minister's arms reduction program went far beyondNATO's by adding missiles, combat aircraft and soldiers.   ``Let me ask what kind of reductions are these if they do notaffect the main component of armed forces _ their personnel?'' hesaid. ``And surely airplanes and helicopters can be used for asurprise attack.''   In the Soviet second phase, 500,000 men on each side would bedemobilized.   According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private U.S.research group, the Warsaw Pact has 3.09 million soldiers and NATOmore than 2.13 million. NATO spends about $300 billion a year todefend Western Europe, where 326,000 Americans are stationed.   As Shevardnadze explained it, the Soviet plan's progression wouldbe:   _ First phase, two to three years: Eliminate the imbalance introops and arms, cutting 10 percent to 15 percent from the currentlowest numbers.   _ Second, also two to three years: Reduce forces by another 25percent and withdraw battlefield nuclear weapons to a safe distancefrom ``the line of contact'' between the military alliances. Thatwould make much of West Germany, along with East Germany andCzechoslovakia a nuclear-free zone.   _ Third: Convert remaining forces to ``a strictly defensivecharacter.''   While the reductions are made, Shevardnadze said, negotiationsshould be conducted on eliminating tactical nuclear weapons inEurope.   His proposal conflicts with the 40-year-old U.S. policy ofdeterring the Soviets with with a mix of weaponry incudingbattlefield nuclear arms, which have a maximum range of 300 miles.   Kohl wants to delay modernizing U.S. Lance missiles in WestGermany for up to three years, with the support of Norway andofficials of other West European governments. Baker is trying tochange the chancellor's mind.   In December, Gorbachev announced a unilateral withdrawal of sixSoviet tank divisions and 50,000 men from Eastern Europe and saidSoviet forces in Europe and Asia would be reduced by 500,000.   How Shevardnadze's three-phase reduction fits into that is notclear. The foreign minister provided few details of an obviouslycomplicated proposition.   Baker said in his speech the Warsaw Pact has 3-1 advantages intanks and artillery and more than 2-1 in armored troop carriers.   He said Gorbachev's offer was ``a good start,'' but the WarsawPact would retain a 2-1 edge in tanks and artillery even after theSoviet leader's reductions.</TEXT></DOC>
