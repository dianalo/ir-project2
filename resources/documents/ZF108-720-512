 401 on Reader Service CardandM;The Apple Macintosh, the computer that first brought glamour to personalcomputing, is now an exciting platform for SQL.andP;  Operating on a client/servermodel, Mac users can get immediate access to data in RDBMS tables on a VAXhost.andP;  Unsophisticated users can easily build queries by using Mac iconsrather than writing dry, sometimes convoluted SQL code, and databaseadministrators can pre-record queries for inexperienced end users to invokewith a few clicks of a mouse.andM;Clear Access from Fairfield Software and Graphical Query Language (GQL) fromAndyne Computing let users access a number of different RDBMSes residing on aVAX.andP;  Both use Apple's Data Access Language (DAL, formerly called CL/1) asthe connectivity vehicle.andP;  (See &quot;Apple's DAL keeps Macs, VAX databases onspeaking terms,&quot; page 33.)andM;Both packages allow users to construct ad hoc SQL queries by using suchgraphical elements as buttons and icons to access lists of tables and fields.andO;After saving the queries, users can run them automatically by clicking on asingle button.andP;  And with Clear-Access, users can record and play back theentire process of connecting, opening the database, querying and returningdata to a Macintosh clipboard or another software package such as aspreadsheet.andM;STEPPING OUTandM;For both products, users must take five steps to access host data on theMacintosh: making a connection, choosing an RDBMS and a database, making thequery, and receiving the data.andM;Users begin by making the connection between the server and host.andP;  bothproducts require some physical connection between a Mac and a VAX, either byasynchronous line, by modern or over an AppleTalk network.andP;  We ran our testsover AppleTalk.andM;Before using either product to make the connection using AppleTalk, wetailored the hosts.cl1 file in the Mac's system folder by inserting a linethat defined the host name, network node name and AppleTalk zone.andM;In clearAccess, the connection to the VAX is made by clicking the Connectbutton to display a screen that asks the user to select a node to which toconnect, and that prompts for the appropriate user name and password.andP;  Aftermaking the connection, ClearAccess displays the next logical screen of RDBMSproduct choices.andP;  To shorten this process, users can include all thepreceding steps in scripts that can be run by just a few clicks in Automaticmode.andM;In GQL, users choose the Make Connection choice of the Host submenu.andP;  Ascreen prompting for the host and user name appears, and users can specifythe RDBMS product at the same time.andM;With both products, after making the connection, users choose an RDBMSproduct from among entries on a list that includes Ingres, Oracle, Rdb,Sybase and Informix.andM;Users choose the RDBMS product in much the same way as they choose theconnection--via the RDBMS button in ClearAccess and via the Set ConnectionType screen of the Host pull-down menu in GQL.andM;Once the RDBMS product is chosen, the user selects a specific database towork with.andP;  DAL software running in a detached process on the host reads thehost schemas, and returns information about tables and fields.andM;Finally, the user performs the query and returns the data either to the Macclipboard or to a product like Excel.andM;ClearAccess installs itself on the client Macintosh when a user clicks on theInstaller icon of one of its two installation diskettes.andP;  (The two additionaldiskettes included in the distribution package contain a guided tour of theproduct and some application examples.)andP;  The software appears in the Applemenu, rather than as an application in a folder.andP;  Its initial screen displaysall the options for the product's general areas (Fig.andP;  1).andM;ClearAccess can run in either manual or automatic mode.andP;  In manual mode,users do each step in the query process in order, from connecting to the hostto choosing a database, to performing the query and handling the data.andP;  Userscan record these steps as they take them to compose scripts that are saved asfiles.andM;In automatic mode, users can run these scripts to perform all tasksautomatically.andM;Although end users can use ClearAccess as a tool to construct queries inmanual mode, many sites might leave this task to application developers.andO;ClearAccess builds queries one step at a time, but they are still in SQL, andappear as such in the window of the query screen (Fig.andP;  2).andM;To create a test query, we first clicked on the Query button of ClearAccess'smain screen.andP;  We then highlighted the User table to bring up the list of itsfields.andP;  After clicking on the fields we wanted to retrieve, we clicked theAdd button to add them to the query.andP;  To construct the Where clause, weclicked on Specify Conditions, then on the field we wanted to qualify.andM;After adding this field to the display, we clicked on a relational operator(in this case the equal sign) and added it.andP;  Finally, we entered a value.andM;Once queries are written and scripts recorded, end users can easily use themby simply clicking on the Run button in automatic mode.andM;Users can set ClearAccess to show each step of an executing script.andP;  A smallicon showing a rapidly rotating globe appears while ClearAccess is working.andO;While scripts can be password-protected to prevent unauthorized access tosensitive data, the database itself is protected via the host database's ownsecurity scheme.andM;Existing scripts can be edited, combined and added to without having to gothrough recording.andP;  However, if users add text to saved scripts, ClearAccessdoes not check the SQL for valid spelling or grammar.andM;Creating simple queries was so easy that we didn't really need to read themanual.andP;  However, the ClearAccess manual is well-written and organized.andP;  ItsQuick Start page, located at the very front before the table of contents, isall that most users will need to begin performing simple queries.andP;  Indeed,given the logical layout of the initial menu screens, some users may not evenneed that much introduction.andM;GRAPHICAL QUERY LANGUAGEandM;GQL consists of three components that are available separately and installedinto a folder from three diskettes.andM;GQL/User, the end-user interface to the data, enables users to make queriesto the database by clicking on database fields in a graphical representationof the host database called a data model, building query syntax, then sendingthe query to the h ost for processing.andP;  The host retrieves the data and sendsit back to the Mac.andP;  The GQL/User component is priced at $295.andM;GQL/Design allows application developers to associate pre-recorded queries.andO;It also lets them create tables on the host by first defining them on the Macclient, making GQL more than a simple query tool.andP;  To do this, the databaseitself must first be created by a database administrator on the hostcomputer.andM;Programmers can use GQL/Design to create complex applications with separatebuttons for any queries that users regularly run.andP;  This module is $995.andM;GQL/Admin takes an existing host database and makes it known to the client.andO;This component is priced at $1,995.andM;The fact that the product is divided into three separate applications makesit somewhat inconvenient for application developers who deal with all threecomponents, but it allows sites to give end users default access to a subsetof the product's functions at a much lower cost than that of the entirepackage.andM;In order to use GQL/User, at least one user at a site must purchase eitherGQL/Design or GQL/Admin (or both) as the tool to create the graphical datamodel.andM;We used GQL/Admin to download the host schema for our Circ database to theMacintosh.andP;  The product created icons for the three tables in the database.andO;We then edited the data model document, adding relationships between thetables by dragging a mouse between their icons.andM;Designers can display an indication of the scope of the relationships betweentables, called cardinalities, by choosing Show Cardinalities from thePreferences screen of the Edit menu.andP;  The design will then show whether arelationship is one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many.andM;Once the diagram is created, all relationships between tables are outlinedgraphically.andP;  Joined fields are defined as part of this process, eliminatingthe need to specify them every time related tables are accessed.andP;  GQLprovides a menu choice to check the design diagram for internal consistency.andM;Once the pictorial representation of the database is set up, users can makequeries by invoking GQL/Users and double-clicking on the table icons.andP;  Thisbrings up a list of fields in the table, along with boxes that enables usersto specify aggregates, qualify fields, and denote whether fields should bepart of the Group By and Sort By clauses.andM;To construct the same query that we used earlier, we double-clicked on theicon to access the table we wanted to query against.andP;  A query window openedin the background.andP;  We then clicked on the fields that we wanted to retrieve(Fig.andP;  3).andP;  To create the Where clause, we clicked on the Qualify box next tothe appropriate field name.andP;  To submit the query, we clicked on the Querychoice on the menu bar, and chose from it the Submit Query option.andP;  Theresults, which appear in a results window, can be manipulated via the Resultsoption of the menu bar.andM;Users can save ad hoc queries by selecting the Save Query choice from thequery sub-menu on the menu bar.andP;  Queries are saved as part of the documentthat contains the diagram.andP;  Alternatively, users can save queries to externalfiles.andP;  The automatically built SQL can be edited before saving, althoughhere, as with ClearAccess, syntax is not checked.andM;Users can invoke saved queries by choosing the Load Query option followed bySubmit Query from the Query choice on the menu bar.andM;Currently, only queries, rather than entire scripts, can be saved, but futureversions of GQL will include the capability to save entire scripts.andM;Application developers can make querying easier on end users by setting upbuttons to invoke queries.andP;  To do this, the developer chooses the CreateButton option from the Layout submenu of GQL/Design's menu bar.andP;  Thedeveloper then specifies a button label (which may be more than one linelong), a query to associate with the button and a destination for the resultsof the query--a window, clipboard or file.andP;  Designers must take care tospecify the query associated with the button correctly at creation time,because once the designer clicks on the OK button, there is no way to alterthe assignment of a query to a button short of deleting and starting over.andM;We measured the overhead these products added to the query process on thehost computer by creating several queries against DR Labs' Circ database asimplemented in Rdb.andP;  The DR Labs test database consists of three tables,called User, Mach and Sys, constituting a subset of the data in a subscriberlist representing more than 80,000 users.andM;The queries we generated included single table access and multitable joins,some qualified on one or more fields, as well as aggregates such as COUNT.andM;We found widely varying results (Fig.andP;  4).andP;  For most of the queries (numbers1, 4, 5, 8, 10), the performance of both products paralleled that of FAX SQL.andO;In queries 7, 9 and 11, the performance of ClearAccess and GQL wascomparable, though not up to VAX SQL standards.andP;  For queries 2, 3 and 6, GQLwas teh more efficient of the two products.andM;Both products impose a small load on the system when DAL establishes aconnection between the Macintosh and the host VAX.andP;  We found that the serverprocess on the VAX used an average of 0.04 CPU seconds and 14 direct I/Ooperations per minute when idle.andM;On the whole, we preferred the intuitive interface of ClearAccess over GQL'sgraphical diagram for making queries.andP;  However, in a more complex database,GQL's front end could be a real aid to users working out the properrelationships among their idea.andM;Both ClearAccess and GQL empower users in the same way the Mac's graphicaluser interface originally did for desktop publishing, by giving them easyaccess to their data without having to resort to requesting time fromprogrammers.andM;ClearAccess and GQL's welcome presence in the marketplace shows thatincreasingly, there's no excuse for failing to scatter Macs around every deskin the office.andM;TEST dr MODELandM;LabsandM;We tested ClearAccess version 1.2 and GQL version 2.0's abilities to createcomplex queries in SQL and save them for quick reuse.andP;  Our queries includedsingle-table queries, multitable queries joined across a common key,qualified retrievals and aggregate retrievals.andM;Test queries were made on an Rdb version of DR Labs' Circ database.andP;  Itsthree tables, Usewr, Mach and Sys, contain information on more than 80,000 DRsubscribers, adapted from an old subscriber list.andM;The User table consists of 14 fields, each record representing a singlesubscriber.andP;  Mach, with more than 313,000 records, contains a separate recordfor each type of machine each subscriber owns, along with the quantity.andP;  Syscomprises more than 223,000 records, with a separate record for eachoperating system at every subscriber's site.andM;To compare the overhead each of these two products added to the hostcomputer's processing load, we measured the CPU time and direct I/O count ofthe test query set, running each query on the host with VAX SQL, then fromthe client Mac with each test product.andM;We performed our queries on a Macintosh II with 8MB of memory, connected to aMicroVAX 3600 over an AppleTalk version 2.0 network.andP;  The transport softwarefor our GQL and ClearAccess queries was Apple's DAL version 1.0.andP;  We ran ourqueries against an Rdb version 3.1 database.andM;Apple's DAL keeps Macs, VAX databases on speaking termsandM;To send queries and receive data between the Mac and the VAX, bothClearAccess and GQL require Apple's Data Access Language (DAL).andP;  Thisconnectivity language serves as a go-between, or translator, between theclient and host.andP;  (See figure at right.)andM;DAL, which began life with the name CL/1, is, in simple terms, a languagethat provides a common way for Mac applications to access VAX databaseswithout having to worry about the different syntactical idiosyncrasies of thedifferent RDBMSes.andP;  Regardless of the particular RDBMS to be accessed, theDAL syntax is the same.andM;There are two components to DAL: the program statements that front-endproducts like ClearAccess and GQL use, and the application program interfacefunction calls that allow application developers to include features of DALin programs they write.andM;To use DAL, a system manager must first install the server software on a VAXand the client software on a Mac.andP;  The system manager then edits a file inthe system folder called hosts.cl1.andP;  This file contains information on theclient and the host that allows them to make network connections.andM;DAL has an interactive component called Tester that lets users query adatabase by using SQL-like syntax without the benefit of other connectivityfront ends like ClearAccess and GQL.andP;  A command-line interface, Tester lacksthe graphical components of the products we tested.andM;DAL runs on a network with AppleTalk version 2.0 or higher, and includes adeveloper's tool kit and HyperCard interface.andM;In its upcoming version 2.1 of GQL, Andyne Computing will offer support forSequeLink, another connnectivity language, from Techgnosis of Boca Raton,Fla.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
