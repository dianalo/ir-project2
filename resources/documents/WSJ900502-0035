Democrats promptly denounced the proposals asinsufficient.   The Republican campaign-finance package would eliminatepolitical action committees, reduce and require stricterdisclosure of &quot;soft money&quot; contributions made to statepolitical parties, restrict contributions from out-of-stateindividual donors, create a special fund for congressionalchallengers, and provide lower broadcast rates to candidates.</LP><TEXT>   These proposals, which Senate Republican Leader RobertDole hailed as an &quot;historic and challenging campaign-reformpackage,&quot; will soon be introduced as legislation by KentuckyRepublican Mitch McConnell, who led the filibuster thatkilled campaign-finance legislation in the Senate two yearsago.   Two leading Democrats, Majority Leader George Mitchell ofMaine and Sen. David Boren of Oklahoma, said the GOPproposals unveiled yesterday wouldn't stem the flow ofspecial-interest money in politics because they wouldn't capthe overall amount of money candidates can spend in theircampaigns. &quot;Without limits on spending there cannot begenuine reform,&quot; Sen. Mitchell said.   There has been a partisan logjam on campaign finance foryears, with Democrats advocating spending caps andRepublicans resisting them. Democrats are also much cooler tothe idea of eliminating the role of PACs, and severalDemocratic senators said that proposals to abolish them wouldbe unconstitutional.   Yesterday, Sen. Boren indicated that Democrats might bewilling to agree to the centerpiece of the Republicanpackagethe abolition of PACs-but only if the Republicans werewilling to embrace some form of spending limits.   Democrats, meanwhile, have been meeting for weeks in anattempt to reach consensus on various campaign-financeproposals. Democrats who face re-election in 1992 are seekingan array of transitional provisions to preserve certainfund-raising advantages they enjoy under the current law. ButSen. Boren said the Democrats are close to agreement and hopeto unveil their proposals in the next few days.   The question left unanswered yesterday is if there is anyreal hope that the partisan deadlock on campaign finance canbe broken this year. &quot;There's still plenty of room fornegotiation,&quot; Sen. Boren said.</TEXT></DOC>
