Background</ITAG>A. AuthorityUnder 40 CFR 260.20 and 260.22, facilities may petition the Agency to removetheir wastes from hazardous waste control by excluding them from the listsof hazardous wastes contained at 40 CFR 261.31 and 261.32. Petitionersmust provide sufficient information to EPA to allow the Agency to determinethat (1) the waste to be excluded is not hazardous based upon the criteriafor which it was listed, and (2) that no other hazardous constituents arepresent in the wastes at levels of regulatory concern.B. History of This RulemakingBrush Wellman Corporation (BWC), formerly S.K. Wellman Corporation, locatedin Bedrord, Ohio, petitioned the Agency to exclude from hazardous wastecontrol a specific waste it generates. After evaluating the petition, onSeptember 28, 1988, EPA proposed to deny BWC's petition to exclude itswaste from the lists of hazardous wastes. See 53 FR 37808.This rulemaking addresses public comments received on the proposal andfinalizes the proposed decision to deny an exclusion to Brush Wellman.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Disposition of Petition</ITAG>Brush Wellman Corporation, Bedford, Ohio.1. Proposed DenialBWC petitioned the Agency for an exclusion of its wastewater treatmentsludge, presently listed as EPA Hazardous Waste No. F006. BWC petitionedto exclude its waste because it does not believe that the waste meets thecriteria for which it was listed. BWC based its petition on the claim thatthe constituents of concern, although present in the waste, are in an essentiallyimmobile form. Data submitted by BWC, however, fail to substantiate itsclaim that the listed and non-listed constituents of concern are presentin an immobile form. See 53 FR 37808, September 28, 1988, for a more detailedexplanation of why EPA proposed to deny BWC's petition for its wastewatertreatment sludge.2. Agency Response to Public CommentsThe Agency received public comments on the proposed rule from one commenter.The commenter strongly supported the Agency's proposed decision to denythe petition, both on the grounds articulated by EPA and for a number ofother reasons.Although the commenter supported the Agency's proposed decision, the commenterexpressed general concerns over EPA's use of the vertical and horizontalspread (VHS) model to evaluate delisting petitions for wastes stored ina surface impoundment. Since the Agency already has sufficient bases todeny Brush Wellman's petition, as detailed in the proposed rule, and thecomments do not change the proposed decision, we did not assess whetherthe additional bases for denial, suggested by the commenter, should beincluded as part of our rationale for denying the petition. Furthermore,the issues raised by the commenter regarding the effectiveness of the VHSmodel, do not affect EPA's decision to deny this petition. In fact, thecommenter raised similar issues on other proposed delisting rules. TheAgency, therefore, did not address these comments in today's final rule.3. Final Agency DecisionFor the reasons stated in the proposal, the Agency believes that the BWC'swastewater treatment sludge should not be excluded from hazardous wastecontrol. The Agency, therefore, is denying a final exclusion to Brush WellmanCorporation, located in Bedford, Ohio, for its wastewater treatment sludge,described in its petition as EPA Hazardous Waste No. F006.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Effective Date</ITAG>This rule is effective immediately. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendmentsof 1984 amended section 3010 of RCRA to allow rules to become effectivein less than six months when the regulated community does not need thesix-month period to come into compliance. That is the case here, sincethis rule does not change the existing requirements for persons generatinghazardous wastes. This facility has been obligated to manage its wasteas hazardous during the Agency's review of their petition. These reasonsalso provide a basis for making this rule effective immediately under theAdministrative Procedures Act, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d).<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Regulatory Impact</ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.The denial of this petition does not impose an economic burden on thisfacility since prior to submitting and during review of the petition, thisfacility should have continued to handle their waste as hazardous. Thedenial of their petition means that they are to continue managing theirwaste as hazardous in the manner in which they have been doing, economicallyand otherwise. There is no additional economic impact, therefore, due totoday's rule. This rule is not a major regulation, therefore, no RegulatoryImpact Analysis is required.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, wheneveran agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking for anyproposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public commenta regulatory flexibility analysis which describes the impact of the ruleon small entities (<T3>i.e.</T3>, small businesses, small organizations, and small governmentaljurisdictions). The Administrator or delegated representative may certify,however, that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on asubstantial number of small entities.This amendment does not have a significant adverse economic impact on smallentities. The facility included in this notice may be considered a smallentity, however, this rule will only affect one facility in one industrialsegment. The overall economic impact, therefore, on small entities is small.Accordingly, I hereby certify that this regulation does not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This regulation,therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>Information collection and recordkeeping requirements associated with thisfinal rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511,44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq</T3>.) and have been assigned OMB Control Number 2050-0053.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 261</ITAG>Hazardous Materials, Waste Treatment and Disposal, Recycling.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> Sec. 3001 RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6921.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: April 20, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan Z.
