Kahan is the recipient of the 1989 A.M.andP;  Turing Award.andP;  Thesecond paragraph of Steve Meyer's ACM Forum letter (Communications, July1990, p. 127) attacks this award on two counts.andM;Meyer first questions the idea that &quot;a contribution to standardization&quot; canform a legitimate basis for the award.andP;  Secondly, he asserts a belief thatthe specific standards (IEEE 754 and 854) are a negative contribution to thefield.andM;In the remaining paragraphs, Meyer wisely does not attempt to justify theseassertions but resorts to ad hominem anecdotes--a typical device of thosemaintaining untenable positions.andP;  Unfortunately for Meyer's case, theanecdotes clearly demonstrate that Kahan has high standards, a trait oftencommended.andM;Further, one anecdote reveals that Meyer himself failed a numerical analysiscourse taught by Kahan.andP;  Since Meyer states a viewpoint that posits that &quot;thenumber of computations is more important than arithmetic accuracy and thatanswers must be evaluated with common sense&quot; (my italics), the failure isclearly justified.andM;The net effect of Meyer's letter is to increase my admiration for Kahan'swork.andM;K.A.andP;  Redish McMaster University Dept.andP;  of Computer Science 1280 Main StreetWest Hamilton, Ontario Canada L8S 4K1andM;Response to U.S.andP;  andandM;ThemandM;Alain Fournier, in his letter &quot;U.S.andP;  and Them?,&quot; published in the ACM Forumin the May 1990 Communications (p.andP;  480), raises an important issue: Is ACMprimarily a &quot;National&quot; rather than an &quot;International&quot; organization?andP;  Oneissue cited by the Membership by ACM to the Membership by ACM leaders tosupport the National High-Performance Computing Initiative (HPC), aninitiative he considers to be strictly in the interests of one particularcountry, the United States.andM;To be more direct, the question raised is whether or not ACM is aninternational organization or a U.S.andP;  organization with a few non-U.S.andO;members.andP;  To be sure, the simple demographic answer to this question is thatthe overwhelming majority of ACM members are U.S.andP;  residents.andP;  The factdictates that issues of importance to computing professionals in the U.S.andO;cannot be ignored by ACM leadership.andP;  But does this mean that ACM leadersshould call on (all) ACM members to support the HPC?andM;The ACM is a scientific and educational society.andP;  Our purpose, as stated inArticle 2 of our Constitution, is &quot;to advance the arts and sciences ofinformation technology.andP;  .  .  .&quot;  If the HPC dealt strictly with issuesgermane to U.S.andP;  politics and did not materially address issues in the artsand sciences information technology, the answer to this latter question wouldclearly be &quot;no.&quot;andP;  But we believe the real issues behind the HPC initiativereach far beyond the U.S.andP;  political arena.andM;Recently the information technology industry in the U.S.andP;  has been sufferingfrom a marked decline in the technical preparedness of scientists andengineers entering the field.andP;  This has been a direct result of the fact thatthe general quality of science education in U.S.andP;  schools has declineddramatically.andP;  The fate and status in scientific education, in any nationwhere ACM members live and work, must be a matter of concern for all ACMmembers.andM;While computer science education has become considerably more available inother countries, it is still the case that the health of U.S.andP;  scienceeducation in general, and computer science education in particular, hasworld-wide implications.andP;  If U.S.andP;  academic programs in science andengineering are declining, we have a responsibility to be concerned, to voicethat concern, and to support any initiative that shows promise of helpingreverse the trend.andM;At the same time we have a responsibility to ensure that our investment inissues is balanced, particularly if that investment involves substantial ACMresources.andP;  The Executive Committee is aware of this responsibility and iscommitted to maintaining a reasonable balance.andP;  We are also committed, duringthe 1990-92 term, to providing enhanced services to non-U.S.andP;  members.andM;The ACM Executive Committee: John R. White, President S. Ron Oliver, VicePresident Barbara Simons, SecretaryandM;Perchance to DreamandM;Thank you for your wonderful publication--and I mean to emphasize the&quot;wonder&quot; part.andP;  Many of your articles evidence the authors' joy in thepursuit of some bit of knowledge, be it fanciful or practical.andP;  I am probablynot alone in wondering exactly what programming errors--or whatever--led tothe Hubble telescope project's problems.andP;  Exactly what failure plagued themission?andP;  And, how complicated does Hubble appear next to SDI?andP;  Thanks againfor the &quot;what if&quot; dreams over the years.andM;Leslie A. Peckham 4508 47th Street Des Moines, IA 50310andM;Editor's Note: Many such questions are discussed in the Risks Forum (by PeterG. Neumann, in the SIGSOFT publication Software Engineering Notes) althoughperhaps not specifically for the Hubble telescope since it does not seem toconstitute a &quot;risk to the public.&quot;andM;On Hiring HackersandM;The May Communications (p.andP;  477) contains a News Track account of some of myremarks on hiring known hackers/crackers.andP;  I believe the account was derivedfrom my keynote presentation at the Third DPMA Virus Workshop held March 14in New York.andP;  Unfortunately, the item in question does not report correctlyand obscures the full context of my remarks.andM;It is my contention that we should not do business with companies that hireknown computer miscrants because of their criminal escapades.andP;  There are tworeasons for this, one grounded in good business sense and the other groundedin professional ethics.andM;From a business standpoint, hiring a known computer criminal because of hisor her criminal past is likely to be a liability.andP;  The individual has alreadyshown no willingness to respect legal and ethical boundaries and hasexhibited poor judgment in not thinking about adverse consequences.andP;  Whatindication is there that such behavior will not be repeated?andP;  Furthermore,there is no indication that someone who breaks into a system knows how toprotect the system or make it better--the hacker has only shown that he orshe knows how to break in.andP;  This is the origin of my &quot;arsonist&quot; statement,quoted in the account.andP;  As a customer of such a firm, it is possible I wouldnever be as confident about the integrity of its products if the hacker hadnot been hired.andM;From a professional standpoint, I view the hiring of computer criminals(because of their notoriety or criminal success) to be insulting andunconscionable.andP;  Consider that there are many tens of thousands of people whohave worked for years to become knowledgeable and responsibile members of theprofession, and there are many thousands more currently studying thediscipline.andP;  What will it mean to them if a criminal is hired to a positionof responsibility because of a violation of professional standards.andP;  Shouldthe rest of us seek distinguished appointments by spectacular violations ofthe law?andP;  What would it say to all of us that a business would valueunethical behavior above a record of accomplishment or professionalism?andP;  Toignore or accept such behavior is to allow our profession to be besmirched.andO;I view it as an insult, and to acquiesce quietly would appear to be aviolation of our codes of professional conduct.andM;Note that I am not in any way suggesting that we act to prevent theseindividuals from being employed in a computing-related profession.andP;  If thisindividual involved has the necessary training and background and is asqualified as other applicants, then he should be treated as any otherindividual applying for a position.andP;  This is especially true once individualshave served sentence for their crimes.andP;  Robert T. Morris, for instance, hasdemonstrated a keen interest and more than moderate facility with computers.andO;To protest his taking a computing-related job would be to unfairly embellishthe sentence already imposed by the federal court.andP;  We should not seek tosecond-guess our legal system, nor extract revenge above and beyond thepunishment already meted out.andP;  To do so would be petty and mean spirited.andM;In summary, my remarks at the Virus Workshop argued that we should protest ifbusinesses reward these offenders for their actions; I did not mean tosuggest that we forbid these individuals from ever working incomputing-related jobs.andP;  I also did not suggest that we devise any additionalpunishment for Mr. Morris.andP;  He has been sentenced for his crime, and it isnot for us to seek to augment his punishment.andP;  It is time for all of us tomove on and put that whole incident behind us.andM;Eugene Spafford Dept.andP;  of Computer Science Purdue University W. Lafayette, IN47907-2004andM;Editor's Note: The quote that appeared in News Track was taken from aquestion-and-answer session following Professor Spafford's presentation atthe DPMA Workshop.andP;  Although we respect his efforts in clarifying his remarksin detail, we stand by our reporting.andM;The Need for ResearchandM;ContributionsandM;For well over 15 years, Communications of the ACM has grappled with the issueof whether or not it should be a forum for &quot;research papers.&quot;andP;  Because ofthat cumulative experience, we are now in a position to answer this questionunequivocally.andP;  The Communications should not publish research papers inestablished branches of our field, but it should publish a limited number ofresearch papers in disciplines that are newly formed and expanding.andP;  Thishas, to some extent, happened naturally in the past and should be encouragedto continue.andM;When a new area starts to become important, the following purposes are servedby the publication of some research papers in the Communications:andM;* It brings the new area to the attention of all of us, doing us a servicewhether or not this is immediately recognized.andM;* It acquaints all of us with the research methodologies of the new area,enabling more knowledgeable reading of review articles in subsequent years.andM;* It helps identify and even define quality work in the new area prior to theformation of specialized transactions or journals on that subject.andM;* It enhances the credibility of the new area in academic and other circles.andM;Once an area has matured sufficiently and become firmly established, it willnaturally develop other articles.andP;  At this point, too, articles.andP;  At thispoint, too, general, review-style articles will begin to appear, which maynot have been possible before the discipline had time to take shape.andP;  Thesewill then be appropriate for Communications.andM;My field, &quot;Human Aspects of Computing,&quot; is a case in point.andP;  Communicationsbegan accepting our research papers around 1980, prior to the formation ofSIGCHI.andP;  We had no research journals then.andP;  Collections of seminal researchpapers rely heavily on work published in the Communications in the early1980s.andP;  Human-computer interaction was well established by the mid-1980s, andseveral research journals devoted to the topic had appeared.andP;  It is thusappropriate for Communications to phase out research papers in this area.andO;But other areas are coming along--hypertext, computer-supported cooperativework, and undoubtedly many others--that do not yet have transactions orjournals and about which we should perhaps all learn something.andP;  It isappropriate to publish a limited number of research papers in such areas.andM;Jonathan Grudin Aarhus University Computer Science Department Ny Munkegade,Bldg.andP;  540 DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark daimi@daimi.aau.dkandM;Editor's Note: Jonathan Grudin gives a concise statement of the rationalealready in place for Communications to publish research articles in emergingspecialties.andP;  Communications, however, does not limit its attention toemerging specialties.andP;  We are interested in articles that report on newresearch results in any specialty.andP;  Our standard is that research articlesmust make the new results accessible to all the readers, not just theimmediate peers in the author's research community.andP;  This is a challengebecause the author must suppress highly technical details and instead presentbackground information, explain the key principles, and analyzetrends--material that is not ordinarily included in traditional researcharticles because it is already understood by the audience of the author'speers.andM;1992 and All That JazzandM;Gerrit Jeelof's article [4] is a thinly veiled argument forprotectiionism--for the European Community (EC).andP;  He presents that EC '92policy of &quot;you can sell it here only if you make it here&quot; as though it werean incontrovertible law of economics instead of an arbitrary barrier tocompetition.andM;However, Jeelof is forthcoming about one thing: EC '92 is not &quot;FortressEurope.&quot;andP;  Instead, it is a baited trap for outsiders who enter the EC to selltheir products.andP;  The trap is being set by EC politicians who have decidedagainst encouraging EC industries to compete with their Japanese and U.S.andO;counterparts.andP;  On the contrary, they intend to handicap Japanese and U.S.andO;firms that do business in the EC and, thereby, render them less threateningto laggard EC industries.andP;  These handicaps include: prejudicial productstandards, biased product-testing regulations, punitive &quot;local origin&quot;requirements, &quot;Buy EC&quot; purchasing policies, and worker-indulgent labor laws(see e.g., [2]).andM;The reasoning and considerations of EC politicians seem to be: if Japaneseand U.S.andP;  firms are forced to manufacture in the EC, under EC conditions,what they sell in the EC, then those firms will surely lose their competitiveadvantages (i.e., costs will rise and product quality will fall).andP;  ECpoliticos apparently believe that, by covering their traps with a &quot;Welcome!&quot;andO;mat, they can preempt protectionist retaliation by non-EC nations that importgoods manufactured within the EC.andM;It appears that the cynical goal of EC '92 is to postpone the inevitabledeterioration of the lethargic, statist economies of EC member nations.andO;However, many (including this writer) believe that EC '92 will onlyaccelerate the decline of those economies.andP;  Ironically, EC '92 is motivated(in part) by the extraordinary success of Japanese industry in emulating (andperfecting) industrial technologies and marketing techniques that originatedin the West (particularly Western Europe and the U.S.).andP;  Sadly, the EC haschosen to discourage its industries from competing with their Japanesecounterparts at this thoroughly Western game.andM;While this characterization of EC '92 may seem pessimistic, it extrapolatesfrom the economic &quot;reforms&quot; that have already been carried out by the EC.andP;  Infact, EC '92 will extend current regulations to cover all business activitycarried out within the EC.andP;  In this regard, EC '92 will be nearly as great aburden to local &quot;insider&quot; businesses as it is to &quot;outsider&quot; business tryingto get in.andP;  For example, biotechnology firms in the EC are alreadycomplaining that excessive meddling by community bureaucrats is preventingthem from obtaining needed capital infusions [1].andP;  Also, Jeolof's own firm(the faltering NV Philips) habitually blames EC regulatory restraints formany of its problems [3].andM;Thus, while many nations (e.g., Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland) nowconcede that their economies have been ruined by statism, EC bureaucrats seemconvinced that they will succeed where others have failed.andP;  However, the twomost notable precedents for EC intervention in business are the subsidies andproduction controls that now shackle the agriculture and steel industries,intrusions that have been economic and financial disasters.andP;  In each case,the industry has grown dependent on subsidies and on the resulting protectionagainst external competition.andP;  Also, the EC's Common Agriculture Program(CAP) is not just costly (54 percent of the EC budget), it is plagued bycorruption and has been blamed for spreading environmentally disastrousfarming practices.andP;  In addition, CAP has been accused of &quot;dumping&quot; theoverproduction induced by its subsidies on the world's food markets (seee.g., [5]).andM;While the EC claims that it is intent on removing artificial impediments todoing business and gaining employment across national boundaries within thecommunity, it is also intent on imposing new restrictions on all businessconducted within its borders.andP;  Thus, under EC '92 policies, the removal ofbarriers between member countries of the EC is to benefit businesses such as:trade in goods and services, transfer of capital, business ownership,licensing of professionals, currency exchange, and currency units (via acommon currency).andP;  But, in return for receiving these benefits, EC businesseswill be burdened by uniform EC regulations covering such matters as:mandatory participation by labor in top management, restrictions onemployment policies, regulation of products and processes, EC-specifiedhealth care and social welfare benefits for workers, and double-digit,&quot;value-added&quot; (to commerce, &quot;removing barriers&quot; (to commerce, employment,etc.) is being revealed as a euphemism for adding layers of bureaucracy andregulation.andP;  In this regard, one predictable result of EC '92 will be a powerstruggle between existing, national bureaucracies of its member countries andthe burgeoning, supranational EC bureaucracy.andM;The EC '92 restraints on business will often be social-engineering measuresdesigned to preserve jobs (at the expense of business flexibility) and toindulge labor unions (at the expense of business efficiency).andP;  As a result,the outlook for employees in EC '92 seems to be all that a labor unionfunctionary could ask for, while the prospects for businesses are somethingless than favorable.andM;Dave Nelson Information Engineering Elisenweg 12 8100 Garmisch-PartenkirchenWest GermanyandM;ReferencesandM;[1] Biotechnology firms say EC is discouraging investment.andP;
