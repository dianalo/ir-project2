Kapor, founder and former chairman of Lotus Development Corp., has started a new company to develop personal computer software.    ON Technology Inc. said its goal is to develop the building blocks for a &quot;new class of software&quot; that can be customized for each owner and that will make personal computers easier to use. ON said it will initially target its product for the Apple Macintosh, but it also will be designed to work with the International Business Machines Corp. PC. It will take ON two years to develop the product.    Mr. Kapor said personal computers currently don't work the way people think and communicate. &quot;Is there any reason for my mother to buy a PC now? The answer is 'no,'&quot; said Mr. Kapor, who provided initial funding for the company in the &quot;low seven figures.&quot;    Mr. Kapor resigned last year from Lotus, maker of the 1-2-3 spreadsheet program, the top-selling personal computer program. He continued as a consultant to Lotus until recently, and helped develop its new information-management program.    Mr. Kapor is chairman of ON Technology, and Peter D. Miller, who resigned in September as Lotus's director of advanced technology, is president. Mr. Kapor said he remains on &quot;cordial&quot; terms with Lotus, and that Lotus has expressed an interest in &quot;taking a look&quot; at ON's software &quot;to see if it makes sense for them to use it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
