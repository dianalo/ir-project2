The Coalition of the Left and Progress seemed set on using itsthree-day mandate to discuss possibilities of a ``national unitygovernment.'' But efforts to form an all-party government werehampered by the two larger parties' insistence on leading it.   National elections June 18 failed to produce a winner. TheCoalition, an anti-American grouping of the Greek Communist Partyand the Eurocommunist Greek Left, emerged as the power broker with28 seats in the 300-seat unicameral Parliament.   The conservative New Democracy Party won 145 seats. ThePanhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK, came in second with 125seats, ending eight years of socialist rule.   Coalition leader Harilaos Florakis has been general secretary ofthe Communist Party since 1974, when it was legalized after the fallof the military dictatorship. It was founded in 1918.   The Coalition rejected a joint-rule proposal by PASOK leaderAndreas Papandreou, the hospitalized caretaker premier, whosemandate to form a government ended Tuesday night. Before that, theconservatives had tried to form a government.   Florakis said his party proposed a government of ``widespreadacceptance'' that would not be led by Papandreou or New Democracyleader Constantine Mitsotakis.   Mitsotakis ruled out formation of a government that would not beheaded by himself.   ``How is it possible for the 13 percent of the Greek people toimpose their will on the 44 percent?'' Mitsotakis said.   New Democracy won 44 percent of the vote, PASOK 39 and theCoalition 13 percent.   If the Coalition cannot form a government by Friday, PresidentChristos Sartzetakis will ask the three major parties to try to setaside their differences and form a coalition. If that fails, thepresident will call early elections under a caretaker administration.   PASOK officials have tried to reach an agreement with thecommunists on a long-term coalition but rejected proposals that didnot give Papandreou the premiership.   The Coalition, a strongly anti-American party, calls for theremoval of U.S. military bases in Greece and withdrawal from NATO.   Papandreou has pledged to put any new agreement with theAmericans on the four bases to a national referendum. The previousagreement ended in December.   ``Cooperation on national issues includes a referendum on thebases,'' said Akis Tsohatzopoulos, a member of PASOK's executivebureau.   Tsohatzopoulos was appointed to negotiate with the communistsbecause Papandreou was still in Athens' General State Hospital.   Papandreou was hospitalized Thursday for pneumonia but laterdeveloped heartand kidney complications. A hospital bulletinWednesday said he was ``no longer in critical condition and in 2-3days we will be able to say when he will be dismissed.''</TEXT></DOC>
