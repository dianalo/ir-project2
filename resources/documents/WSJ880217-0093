The pact, reached yesterday after 9 1/2 hours of talks, must be accepted by a majority of Ford's 32,500 workers in the United Kingdom to take effect.    A vote is scheduled for tomorrow and the result will be announced Friday, a Ford U.K. spokesman said. If the offer is accepted, Ford workers would return to their jobs Monday, the spokesman added.    Under the new offer, Ford workers would receive a 7% pay increase -- retroactive to last November -- and a further increase this November of 7%, or 2.5 percentage points above inflation, whichever is higher. The company's previous offer, which the workers rejected earlier this month, included a 7% wage increase in the first year, followed by rises of 2.5 percentage points above inflation for the following two years.    In a concession to the unions, the contract would run for two years instead of the three-year contract sought by the company. In return, workers would agree in principle to accept revised work practices, which would boost Ford's productivity and efficiency at its U.K. plants.    Union negotiators have agreed to &quot;actively seek&quot; approval for the offer from rank-and-file members, the Ford U.K. spokesman said. Jimmy Airlie, one of the union negotiators for the Ford workers, said union leaders were &quot;confident our workers will understand their strike&quot; has achieved &quot;a major breakthrough&quot; and would accept the company's offer.    Ford's previous contract offer was rejected Feb. 4 by 62% of the work force, despite union leaders' recommendation that it be approved.    Rank-and-file members objected in particular to the three-year contract and to the proposed changes in working practices -- which would involve skilled craftsmen working short stints on the production line, and the deploymnent of hourly paid workers as supervisors and Japanese-style quality circles to boost productivity.    The nine-day strike has cost Ford about #530 million ($925.6 million) in lost production of vehicles at showroom values. The walkout halted production at Ford's 22 U.K. plants and at a Ford plant in Genk, Belgium, which depends on British manufactured parts.    Analysts said yesterday that Ford would achieve its most important goals if its striking workers accepted the changes in work practices. The two-year contract isn't a major concession, analysts said.    The increased pay offer probably won't hurt Ford, which is expected to report a major increase in pretax profit for 1987.    But the wage increase would be a serious setback for the British industry's efforts to hold down wage costs.    John Hougham, Ford's chief negotiator, denied that the new offer was softened because of pressure from the Dearborn, Mich.-based company or Ford of Europe. The deal is a &quot;potential victory for common sense,&quot; he said.    The strike has cost the unions about #650,000 ($1.1 million) a week in strike pay.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the company closed yesterday at $44 a share, up 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
