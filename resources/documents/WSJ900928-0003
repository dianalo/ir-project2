U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood said she would hold atwo-week hearing to air the government's allegations againstthe former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond king. Thehearing will likely be held next month. Judge Wood said sheplanned to give both prosecutors and defense lawyers 20 hourseach to present arguments and cross-examine witnesses.</LP><TEXT>   As previously reported, prosecutors had sought such ahearing -- over the strenuous objections of Mr. Milken'slawyers -- and have notified lawyers for witnesses who aidedthe government in its case against Mr. Milken that thesewitnesses may be called to testify.   Among the witnesses the government has indicated it maycall are Ivan F. Boesky, the convicted former Wall Streetstock speculator, and David Solomon, a former money manager.Prosecutors have also notified former Drexel employees thatthey may be called.   Yesterday, Arthur Liman, Mr. Milken's lead lawyer, opposedsuch a hearing, saying it &quot;will prolong the agony&quot; of Mr.Milken's family. Mr. Liman said he would talk to prosecutorsduring the weekend to see if a hearing could be avoided.   Prosecutors sought the hearing because they want JudgeWood to consider the full force of their case against Mr.Milken when she sentences him. Mr. Milken pleaded guilty lastApril to six felony counts relating to securities fraud andfaces a maximum jail term of 28 years.   The government has urged Judge Wood to sentence Mr. Milkento &quot;substantial&quot; jail time and has painted the 44-year-oldMr. Milken as a white-collar criminal of major proportions.In a sentencing memorandum made public earlier this week, thegovernment unleashed a barrage of additional alleged crimesthat it believes Mr. Milken committed. The alleged crimesinclude insider trading and illegal payoffs to certain moneymanagers and other favored clients.   Mr. Milken's attorneys have urged Judge Wood to view Mr.Milken's crimes as aberrations in an otherwise exemplary lifeand to sentence him to perform fulltime community service.His lawyers have accused the government of presentingevidence of offenses that Mr. Milken has &quot;never acknowledgedand has never committed.&quot;   In calling for the extraordinary hearing, Judge Wood saidthat the court may take into account unadmitted conduct inissuing a sentence. &quot;Considering unadmitted conduct gives thecourt a sense of a defendant's character,&quot; Judge Wood said.   She said that to avoid a lengthy hearing on all of thegovernment's allegations, she would limit the time that thegovernment could spend presenting its case. She said sheexpected the government to concentrate on less than a dozenof the transactions it has alleged were illegal, but to whichMr. Milken hasn't admitted guilt.   A judge is not obligated to take the government'sadditional allegations into consideration when deciding on anappropriate sentence. But if Judge Wood decides she wishes toconsider the additional evidence in meting out a sentence,Mr. Milken is entitled to defend himself at a hearing.   A similar battle over sentencing took place earlier thisyear in the case against Robert Freeman, the former head ofarbitrage at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. who pleaded guilty to asingle charge of insider trading. In that case, the judgesaid that in issuing a sentence, he wouldn't consider anycrimes other than that to which Mr. Freeman pleaded guilty.The government alleged that Mr. Freeman committed some 20other crimes.</TEXT></DOC>
