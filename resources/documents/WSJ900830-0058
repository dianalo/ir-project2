But the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, besides upsetting thebalance of power in the Mideast, has promoted a radicalchange in the views of the U.N. held by American policymakers and others. The U.N. has won praise in recent yearsfor its role in brokering an end to the Iran-Iraq war and thewithdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. For the firsttime since its founding 45 years ago, however, theorganization seems poised to realize its potential, coming ofage as a formidable instrument for resolving internationalconflicts before they erupt into war.</LP><TEXT>   Today, with Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar setto meet with Iraq's foreign minister in Jordan in an effortto end the Persian Gulf standoff, even a lot of longtime U.N.skeptics believe that the organization may have been bornagain.   &quot;The U.N. is in exactly the kind of crisis that it wasdesigned to deal with: armies crossing borders,&quot; saysDemocratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a formerchief delegate to the U.N. who became known for assailing itas a captive of resentful Third World nations.   Yet even as the U.N. enjoys its new-found respect, thereare indications that the whiff of hope -- even romance --surrounding the organization may not last forever. Inparticular, the small nations that used the U.N. as aplatform for attacking the industrialized world may now seethe newly united superpowers using it for their own purposes,ignoring Third World concerns.   &quot;When the superpowers are working together,&quot; complainsAbdullah al-Ashtal, Yemen's U.N. delegate, &quot;little attentionis being paid to the smaller countries.&quot;   The organization won a second chance when the Cold Warfizzled out and the superpowers stopped using their power toveto any action benefiting the other. Suddenly the U.N. wasfreed from paralysis, emerging as a peacemaking andnation-building force around the globe.   &quot;The U.N. was a rusty car out in the garage that all of asudden someone has discovered could be driven,&quot; says EdwardLuck, president of the United Nations Association, anonprofit research group.   In February, during the organization's supervision ofNicaragua's first free elections, U.N. banners declaring that&quot;your vote is secret&quot; fluttered above polling places in eventhe most remote villages. After elections in the new Africannation of Namibia in April, local residents held a series offarewell bashes for U.N. diplomats, slaughtering sheep andcattle for the feast. Some Namibians even named their newbornchildren Untag, the acronym for the U.N. TransitionAssistance Group.   Just this week the five permanent members of the SecurityCouncil agreed to an unprecedented plan for a truce and U.N.administration of Cambodia until a new government is elected.   But it was Iraq's invasion of Kuwait earlier this monththat turned all eyes toward the U.N. A series of unanimousSecurity Council votes on steps to counter Saddam Hussein'sexpansionism suddenly presented a picture of the world bodyacting as the world always hoped it could. &quot;If we can pullthis off we have a model . . . with the U.N . . . of how todeal with the next half-century,&quot; Sen. Moynihan says.   But the resolutions dealing with the Iraqi invasion revealimportant institutional flaws remaining. Regardless of howmany resolutions it passes, the U.N. by itself still doesn'thave the muscle to enforce its decisions. &quot;It happens thatthe U.S. is eager to enforce this one,&quot; says John Ruggie,director of the University of California Institute on GlobalConflict and Cooperation. &quot;What happens when the U.S. isn'tso eager?&quot;   In addition, some Americans, particularly foreign-policyconservatives, continue to harbor grave concerns that theU.N. remains a forum for attacking the U.S. and its economicinterests. &quot;The danger in the Iraq crisis is that people willsay the U.N. isn't so bad after all,&quot; says Midge Decter,executive director of the Committee for the Free World.&quot;People should be steadier in their enmities.&quot;   But even the harshest U.N. critics acknowledge that theorganization has begun playing a useful role in world troublespots from Africa to Asia to Latin America. The U.N. is closeto completing an agreement in the long Western Saharastruggle between Polisario insurgents and Morocco. It isleading an effort to seek a negotiated peace in El Salvador.In the Mideast, U.N. peacekeeping forces are stationed insouthern Lebanon, the Golan Heights, the Sinai and, standingbetween hostile armies as little as 30 feet apart, on theIran-Iraq border.   But the U.N. nearly didn't get off the ground at allbecause of disagreements among the great powers when they metin San Francisco in 1945 to design the organization. Withfresh memories of the failure of the League of Nations -- anAmerican idea that never won American membership -- war-wearynations fought over how much power to give the big powers toallow them to police the world.   The Soviets insisted that each permanent member of theSecurity Council -- the U.S., the Soviet Union, GreatBritain, France and China -- should have the power to wield aveto to end any discussion, investigation or resolution. TheU.S. wanted to limit veto powers, however, arguing that onlydecisions of the Security Council, not other business, shouldbe subject to veto.   Harold Stassen, the former perennial GOP presidentialcandidate and the only surviving member among the eightofficials appointed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt to helpcreate the U.N., says that superpower politics dominated eventhis early dispute. Mr. Stassen says that President Trumandispatched a trusted aide to Moscow to warn Stalin that if hedidn't yield on the point, there wouldn't be a U.N. TheSoviets signed on and the U.N. was born.   The organization, already divided between a GeneralAssembly in which the smaller nations could debate issues anda Security Council where the enforcement work would be done,was from the start paralyzed by the Cold War. Swiftly theveto became a tool for obstruction -- and the U.N. founditself hopelessly tangled in ideological disputes.   &quot;The Soviets saw any act of aggression by someone in theirbloc as an act of liberation,&quot; says Jeane Kirkpatrick,President Reagan's envoy to the U.N. &quot;If this were two yearsago, the Soviets and those associated with them would havedefined what Iraq did as an act of liberation.&quot;   When Libya invaded Chad in 1983, the 15-member SecurityCouncil did nothing. Chad's foreign minister wandered thehalls of the U.N. in his long, flowing, light-blue robes,hopelessly in search of support. And several months later,when Mrs. Kirkpatrick was speaking in the General Assembly indefense of the U.S. military action on the Caribbean islandof Grenada, several delegates interrupted her remarks andmoved to end the debate. The president of the GeneralAssembly agreed and she was abruptly silenced.   But in the current Gulf crisis, the U.N. has emerged as aninvaluable tool. President Bush, himself a former U.N.delegate, understood the potential of the organization forproviding cover and legitimacy for his response to Iraq'sinvasion of Kuwait. Without the prospect of U.N. support, hemight not have been able to persuade Saudi Arabia to acceptU.S. troops. Without U.N. action, it would have been moredifficult for an Islamic state such as Turkey to close itsoil pipelines. Without the U.N., the likelihood of Sovietinvolvement in international action was slim; from theoutset, Moscow made it clear that it would not move withoutthe U.N.   The administration has at some points in the currentcrisis moved at a slower pace, or shown more caution, thanofficials would have preferred -- specifically in order tokeep the five permanent members of the Security Councilmoving in unison. For instance, Mr. Bush held off onunilaterally enforcing the embargo. That was a deliberatestrategy chosen in hopes that this crisis could set aprecedent in which the Security Council showed it would takeconcerted action against international aggressors, somethingit has seldom done in the past.   Republican Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, a prominentforeign-policy voice in the Senate, saw vivid illustration ofthe importance of the U.N. when he traveled this month toIndonesia, an Islamic country that has joined the U.N.embargo on Iraq. He said that officials there told him thatJakarta wasn't interested in siding with the U.S. in theGulf, but was willing to join a U.N. effort. &quot;For them U.N.leadership gives them the umbrella they need,&quot; Sen. Lugarsays. &quot;It offers a new option to them.&quot;   The U.N. also won plaudits for its role in supervisingNicaragua's elections last February, which resulted in thesurprise defeat of the leftist Sandinista government that hadruled there for a decade. Nicaragua was the first membernation that ever invited the U.N. to monitor an election. Theorganization moved in seven months before the vote to beginplanning its supervisory activities and by election day hadnearly 200 observers roaming the country in 31 white,radio-equipped Toyotas and power boats.   At a rural polling place 20 miles from Managua, RigobertoAguirie, waiting in the hot sun to vote, said that &quot;the mostimportant thing is for people to believe that these electionswill be fair&quot; -- and the presence of the U.N. and otherorganizations provided that assurance. Officials from theinternational organization tabulated a parallel vote bysampling each polling place to test the accuracy of thegovernment's final tally.   But the U.N. also has mastered some of the small detailsof diplomacy that become so important in countries where freeelections are a novelty rather than the norm.   While U.N. observers were monitoring a political rally inManagua last winter, for example, violence erupted andseveral rocks were hurled at an opposition-party vehicle. TheU.N. observers remained on the scene after the rally brokeup, taking statements from the car owners and escorting themto local authorities to ensure that their complaints wereregistered.   &quot;It really made a big difference,&quot; says Larry Garber, aconsultant to the National Democratic Institute forInternational Affairs, an affiliate of the U.S. DemocraticParty that helps promote democracy abroad. &quot;It increases theconfidence of people that they can participate in politicalactivities and cast their votes freely.&quot;   ---                Security Council's Busy Month                                                                                                          On Iraq                                                                                                       withdraw.
