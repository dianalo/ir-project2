The transitionmetals used were Ti(IV), V(V) (both incorporated in the alkaline mediumitself) Cr(III), Mn(II), Fe(III), Co(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II), using theirwater soluble salts (sulphates of Mn(II) and Cu(II) and chlorides ofthe others). Some of the transition metal ions used showed definite voltagrammetricpeaks, e.g. Cr(III), Cu(II) and Mn(II) in the case of anodic conversionand V(V), Mn(II), Ti(IV), Fe(III), Cu(II) and Cr(III) in the case ofcathodic conversion. It was noted that the electrocatalytic activityof a given transition metal ion varied with the applied emf, suggestingthat no transition metal ion is a universal electrocatalyst and thateach transition metal ion catalyses, at a particular emf, through itscharacteristic mode of electro-chemical reaction. 24 refs., 3 figs.,2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
