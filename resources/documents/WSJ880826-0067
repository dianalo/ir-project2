Schlender (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> SUNW TXN </CO><IN> ELE EDP </IN><TEXT>   Sun Microsystems Inc. next week will add Texas Instruments Inc. to the list of chipmakers manufacturing its high-performance Sparc microprocessor, according to sources close to the company.    At a news conference scheduled for next Tuesday, it is understood that the two companies also will announce that Texas Instruments data systems division will use the Sparc microprocessor as the centerpiece of a new line of business computers. A spokeswoman for Sun declined to comment on the planned announcement, and officials of Texas Instruments couldn't be reached for comment.    Currently, four chipmakers make versions of the Sparc chip, a state-of-the-art microprocessor that employs so-called RISC, or reduced-instruction-set-computing techniques. The first to sign up was Fujitsu Microelectronics Inc., a Santa Clara, Calif.-based unit of Japan's Fujitsu Ltd. Also making the chip are Cypress Semiconductor Corp. of San Jose, Calif., Bipolar Integrated Technologies of Beaverton, Ore., and LSI Logic Corp. of Milpitas, Calif.    According to analysts, Dallas-based Texas Instruments will license the Sparc design of Cypress, which is one of the most powerful microprocessors on the market. &quot;This is a real boost to Cypress, as well as to Sun and Texas Instruments,&quot; said Adam Cuhney, a securities analyst who follows the chip industry for Kidder Peabody andamp; Co. &quot;It gives more credibility to Sun's Sparc design, it ensures a second source for the Cypress version of the chip, and it gives Texas Instruments access to an industry standard RISC microprocessor, something they have been missing.&quot;    If Texas Instruments indeed adopts the Sparc chip for its own business computers, it marks the fourth big U.S. computer maker to do so. Sun, a Mountain View, Calif.-based maker of technical workstations, already has signed up American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., Xerox Corp. and Unisys Corp. to use the Sparc chip in future computers.    RISC technology is the latest rage in the computer industry. As the term implies, RISC machines work faster because they have fewer basic functions to perform. Other industry giants, such as Hewlett-Packard Co., Apollo Computer Inc. and International Business Machines Corp., have announced ambitious plans to incorporate RISC machines into their product lines. And other chipmakers, such as Motorola Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Mips Computer Systems Inc., also offer RISC microprocessor chips. To date, however, Sun's Sparc has won the most customers.    &quot;Texas Instruments has been shut out of the microprocessor business for a long time,&quot; added Mr. Cuhney. &quot;This will bring them right back in in a hurry.&quot;    Texas Instruments' decision to start making Sparc chips might be the most significant endorsement yet for the chip, according to Michael Slater, publisher of Microprocessor Report, a Palo Alto, Calif.-based newsletter. &quot;Texas Instruments is by far the largest chipmaker to support Sparc,&quot; he said. &quot;The others are all little upstarts by comparison.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
