SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The densely settled Northeast has become thenation's least populated region, falling behind the West for thefirst time, the Census Bureau reported Thursday.   The bureau also projected that Texas will surpass New York forsecond place behind California in population by 1995.   And between now and the year 2000, half of all U.S. populationgrowth will occur in just three states: California, Texas andFlorida, the report said.   The projections are based on assumptions about trends in births,deaths, immigration and movement within the country, bureaudemographer Signe Wetrogen explained.   The Northeast has been declining in its share of the U.S.population, with less growth than other areas, Wetrogen said in atelephone interview. ``It is the one region with the highest shareof population in the older ages, and has low birth rates.''   Population shifts to the South and West in recent years havedrawn away many people in the prime ages of 18 to 24, ``so the(Northeast) region is left with more older people, and it's leftwithout anybody to have more kids,'' she said.   The Northeastern states, relatively smaller in land area thanother parts of the country, remain the mosty densely packed,however. New Jersey leads the nation with more than 1,000 peopleper square mile.   Between 1987 and 1988, the Western region increased from 49.6million people to 50.5 million, the report said. At the same time,the population of the Northeast edged upward from 50.1 million to50.3 million, to slip into last place.   The 1988 estimates listed the South with 85.1 million people,followed by the Midwest with 59.6 million.   Historical records show that, while it was the center of earlyAmerican development, the Northeast hasn't actually been the mostpopulous region since 1820, when the South edged ahead. It remainedsecond until 1880, falling to third behind both the Midwest andSouth.   By 1990, the projections call for the South to have 87.3 millionpeople, followed by the Midwest, 59.8 million; West, 52.3 million;and Northeast, 50.6 million.   By 2000, the counts are expected to be 96.9 million for theSouth, 59.6 million for the Midwest, 59.4 million for the West and51.8 million for the Northeast.   By 2010, the report added, the West could replace the Midwest asthe second-most-populous region.   State population projections showed California remainingunchallenged as the largest state, growing from 28 million peopletoday to 29.1 million in 1990 and 33.5 million in 2000.   Texas is expected to surpass New York for second rank by 1995.The Empire State now leads Texas 17.7 million to 17.2 million, butby 1995 Texas is projected to have just over 19 million people,with New York at only 17.9 million.   Florida is expected to remain the fourth-largest state, althoughby the year 2010 it may be closing in on New York as well, theCensus Bureau said.   By the year 2000, Illinois will have replaced Pennsylvania infifth place and Georgia will move into 10th, displacing NorthCarolina, the report said.   The U.S. population was projected to grow from 243.3 million in1987 to 267.7 million in 2000.   In that period, California is expected to add 6 millionresidents, Florida 3.5 million and Texas 3.3 million. That meansthose states would have growth of 12.8 million people, 52 percentof the national increase of 24.4 million.   Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa, West Virginia and the District ofColumbia were projected to lose population this decade.   Population losses in the 1990s were predicted for nine morestates: Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Dakota,Nebraska, Kentucky, Montana and Wyoming. On the other hand, growthwas predicted to resume in the District of Columbia.   During the 1990s, the maturing of the post-World War II BabyBoom generation will be reflected in the growth of the 45-64 agegroup in all parts of the country. The number of people aged 24 to44 is expected to drop in the Northeast and Midwest but growelsewhere, the report said.   The study said the South continues to have the largestpercentage of blacks in its population, 16 percent. More than halfof all black Americans reside in the South, and that is expected tocontinue.</TEXT></DOC>
