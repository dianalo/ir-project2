The system combines a new kind of optical glass fibercontaining the rare-earth erbium with pump lasers developedby Bell Labs two years ago to exploit the science ofsolitons, or low-resistance waves.</LP><TEXT>   While the new system is still several years fromcommercialization, scientists at American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co.'s research and development unit said it shouldgreatly benefit undersea cable systems, potentially expandingcapacity by a factor of 10 and cutting costs by a similaramount.   &quot;This {new system} has got a lot of us really excited,&quot;said Jack M. Sipress, director of undersea systems at BellLabs. &quot;Our research has shown that we can get a {light} pulseacross the ocean with no conversion equipment, {turning} thecable into a hollow pipe that's capable of handling greateramounts of traffic.&quot;   The current trans-Atlantic fiber-optic cable, calledTAT-8, costs about $350 million and is capable of carrying40,000 phone conversations simultaneously at 280 millionbits-per-second (megabits). Next year, a TAT-9 system will gointo operation with the capacity to carry 80,000 callssimultaneously at 560 megabits. The new system offerscapacity of 700,000 simultaneous phone calls and transmissioncapacity of five billion bits-per-second, said Mr. Sipress.Systems offering such capacity will be necessary in thefuture to handle an expected huge increase in videotransmissions, as well as in voice and data traffic.   However, Mr. Sipress cautioned that the work led byscientist Linn F. Mollenauer must still undergo several moreyears of rigorous testing, including field trials, beforefuture ATandamp;T transmission systems can incorporate the newdesign. But &quot;this lays the foundation for engineering actualsystems,&quot; he said.   In today's optical cable systems, signals sent by laserlight pulses deteriorate over long distances due to the glassfiber's refractive qualities. To keep the signal active,optical cable systems such as the trans-Atlantic cable mustuse a chain of electrical/electronic repeaters inserted atintervals of 50 to 80 kilometers along the fiber cable. Eachrepeater takes the weakened signal from a laser located atthe end of the cable and electrically amplifies it beforeregenerating the signal via laser and sending it on to thenext repeater in the chain.   While the system of repeaters works, it's inefficientbecause it creates choke points for signals that originateand terminate on either end of the cable, which in the caseof submarine cables are located on shore, said Mr. Sipress.These repeaters are difficult and costly to repair especiallyif the fix must be made in mid-ocean.   ATandamp;T's new system may change all of this. Erbium's uniqueluminescent properties provide optical gain in regions of thefiber through which signals are transmitted and where thereis the least optical loss. Pump lasers, developed by BellLaboratories in 1988 by Mr. Mollenauer, amplify &quot;soliton&quot;optical communications pulses so that they maintain theirshape over long distances.   Mr. Mollenauer discovered that when an erbium-laced fiberis attached to the end of a standard glass fiber at 25-30kilometer intervals along with a pump laser, the erbium-dopedpieces act as natural signal boosters, eliminating the needfor expensive electrical conversion equipment. Recently, heused the system in his laboratory to transmit signals 10,000kilometers with no electrical conversion. That's more thandouble the record-breaking 4,000 kilometers over which Mr.Mollenauer transmitted a light pulse two years ago, usingonly soliton pump lasers.   &quot;The impact of this in terms of new equipment is fiveyears away, at least,&quot; said Richard Mack, an analyst atKessler Marketing Intelligence Corp., Newport, R.I. &quot;But it'sa significant advance.&quot;   High-capacity systems such as the one designed by Mr.Mollenauer is the latest in a series of fiber-opticbreakthroughs to come out of Bell Labs this year. Earlier,the company demonstrated an optical switch that will be thebasis for future super high-capacity switching systemscapable of handling voice, data and video traffic fromhigh-speed optical systems with no electronic intervention.</TEXT></DOC>
