MillerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/03/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Robert Salsbury, a former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. arbitrage analyst, drew a lenient sentence of three years' probation and community service for his role in the &quot;Yuppie Five&quot; insider-trading case.    Mr. Salsbury, 28 years old, had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and attempting to obstruct a federal investigation. The two counts' maximum combined penalties are 10 years of prison and a $500,000 fine.    Mr. Salsbury has asserted that senior Drexel officials were aware of his insider trading, a contention his lawyer repeated at yesterday's sentencing. Drexel denied that charge.    Since Mr. Salsbury and the other four figures in the Yuppie case were indicted in May, Drexel has come under much closer scrutiny for alleged insider trading. The firm is currently the subject of investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and a federal grand jury, as part of the widening Ivan Boesky scandal that came to light last month.    In the sentencing in U.S. District Court, Judge Gerard L. Goettel noted that Mr. Salsbury is continuing to cooperate with the government's insider-trading probes. He cited a &quot;belief that his cooperation is going to lead to the exposure of much more important and seasoned malefactors.&quot;    Judge Goettel also made reference to the fact that the scope of the insider-trading investigations has grown dramatically since Mr. Salsbury and the other four members of that ring were first apprehended. &quot;The yuppies are turning out to be puppies,&quot; the judge said.    Government investigators have said the Yuppie case is unrelated to the probes of Mr. Boesky and Dennis B. Levine.    Mr. Salsbury was the second of the quintet to be sentenced. Last week Judge Goettel sentenced Andrew Solomon to one year's probation, a $10,000 fine and 250 hours of community service. As with Mr. Salsbury, Mr. Solomon's light sentence was attributed to his cooperation in the insider-trading investigations.    In asking the judge for leniency yesterday, Mr. Salsbury's lawyer depicted the young man as someone in deep emotional turmoil. The lawyer, Stacey Moritz, said Mr. Salsbury has been under medication as part of his psychological treatment.    Mr. Salsbury, who appeared calm but flushed at the proceedings, declined to speak at the proceedings but handed the judge a brief letter expressing his contrition.    Judge Goettel explained his decision not to fine Mr. Salsbury by noting that &quot;his net worth is a substantial negative.&quot;    According to the government's indictments, Mr. Salsbury received inside tips from Michael David, a young lawyer who lived in his apartment building, and traded on that information at Drexel's arbitrage department. Mr. David, a former associate at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton andamp; Garrison, was also alleged to be passing information to Mr. Solomon, an analyst at Marcus Schloss and Co.; Morton Shapiro, a stockbroker at Moseley, Hallgarten, Estabrook andamp; Weeden Inc., and Daniel Silverman, who had a brokerage account at Moseley.    While the government didn't specify the ring's illegal profits, it said that in one case Messrs. David, Shapiro, and Silverman made nearly $140,000 in options trading based on inside information. Ms. Moritz said yesterday Mr. Salsbury never profited personally from the insider trading.    In addition, the government charged that Mr. Salsbury tried to obstruct the SEC's investigation by urging Mr. Solomon to lie to the SEC about his role in the ring. </TEXT></DOC>
