<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-44-1212 </DOCNO><TEXT>Any reliable estimation of the frequency with which low doses of ionisingradiation cause cancer requires a detailed study of records from verylarge exposed populations, over long periods of time following exposure,and with an exact comparison of cancer frequencies with those of equallylarge or larger populations which have not been similarly exposed, butin which the cancer incidences of mortalities have been ascertained withequal efficiency. Special problems occur in finding appropriate comparisongroups for occupationally exposed workers and for patients treated orinvestigated radiologically. These are discussed, together with the difficultiesin ensuring comprehensive recording of total cancer incidence, ratherthan of mortality.</TEXT></DOC>
