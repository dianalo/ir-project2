David Rossin's comment (letters to the Editor, Aug. 29) that our environment would be worse off if &quot;electricity were generated from fossil fuels,&quot; I submit the following statement by Lord Marshall, chairman of Britain's Central Electricity Generating Board. The quotation is taken from Access to Energy, September 1988, a monthly newsletter published by Dr. Petr Beckmann of Boulder, Colo.    &quot;Earlier this year, British Nuclear Fuels released into the Irish Sea some 400 kilograms (880 lbs.) of uranium, with the full knowledge of the regulators. This attracted considerable media attention and, I believe, some 14 parliamentary questions (to the government on the floor of the House of Common for immediate response).    &quot;I have to inform you that yesterday the CEGB released about 300 kilograms (660 lbs.) of radioactive uranium, together with all its radioactive decay products, into the environment. Furthermore, we released some 300 kilograms of uranium the day before that. We shall be releasing the same amount of uranium today, and we plan to do the same tomorrow. In fact we do it every day of every year so long as we burn coal in our power stations. And we do not call that 'radioactive waste'; we call it coal ash.&quot;    The British experience makes it clear that the radiation threat of waste disposal from coal-fired electric generation is far greater than from nuclear power plants.
