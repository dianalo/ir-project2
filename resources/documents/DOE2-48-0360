The advantages and disadvantages of the different technologicalgenerations of commercial medical CT scanners available as core analysisinstruments are also discussed. Additionally, methods are presented forimproving images and reducing CT-number errors inherent in the scanningof high-density rock samples on instruments whose software was designedfor the scanning of the low-density human patients.</TEXT></DOC>
