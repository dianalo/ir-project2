Gerard Rudden, a spokesman with the Treasury Department's Bureauof Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said the agency is requestingenforcement by Customs of the temporary import ban on five types ofsemi-automatic weapons announced by the Bush administration earlierthis month.   ``When the ban was imposed, it included the further importationof any of these types of firearms, if they had not physicallycleared customs,'' he said.   Rudden said ``ATF has gone back to individuals who hadimportation requests previously approved and told them that any ofthese types of firearms would not be permitted into the country.They were told that the importation privilege was suspended.''   The Los Angeles Times quoted an unidentified Customs source assaying that the number of weapons previously approved for importtotaled about 420,000.   Rudden said he was unable to confirm or deny that figure. But headded that the numbers specified several months ahead in importpermit applications are frequently much higher than the weaponsactually shipped into this country.   ``It's not unheard of for someone to ask to bring in 50,000firearms and actually bring in only 100 firearms,'' he said.   President Bush will call a high-level meeting early this week todiscuss the status of administration efforts to deal with concernsabout firearms in drug-related violence, and to talk about whatfurther actions may be taken, a White House official said Saturday.   The White House meeting is slated to involve Bush along withAttorney General Dick Thornburgh, national drug policy directorWilliam J. Bennett and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. Themeeting had been set for Friday, but Brady could not make it thatday, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Bush said in an interview with The Washington Times that he hasbeen prompted to ``think anew'' on the issue in the wake of appealsfrom law enforcement groups.   ``I think the whole American people have changed,'' he said.``When they see kids getting killed in a schoolyard _ and I'm astrong sportsman, a hunter, have been all my life. And I'veresisted the outrageous claims of some that would strip awaylegitimate weapons from legitimate sportsmen.   ``But here we've got a major new problem _ new in its intensity_ facing this country,'' Bush said.</TEXT></DOC>
