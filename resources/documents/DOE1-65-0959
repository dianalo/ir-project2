Extensive analysis of wind energy insouthern Alberta, shows the area to be suitable for development of windenergy. Wind in southern Alberta, also have a high degree of reliabilityand storage requirements for continuous energy supply are within thelimits of practicality. The Delta turbine, combined with variable capacitypumping, is able to operate at peak efficiency throughout the range ofwind speeds, which accounts for its capture of about twice as much ofthe available wind energy and its consequent greater outputs per unitof size. The components of the Delta turbine and pump are capable ofmanufacture in Alberta from readily available steel. Operating stressescan be kept within allowable limits for indefinite system life, and designfor reliability, long life and survival in gusts to 160 mph is feasible.The study of existing and potential pumping installations identifiedeleven categories of water pumping uses for which the Delta turbine appearssuitable in combination with appropriate storage. The most effectiveapplications are for the improvement and expansion of irrigation andfor hydro power generation. The preliminary analysis shows the Deltaturbine system described to be clearly economic compared to other conventionalenergy alternatives. Provided the Delta turbine system can be readilydemonstrated to service water use demands, its economic attractivenesswill ensure its marketablility. Included are 7 folded blueprints. 78refs., 23 figs., 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
