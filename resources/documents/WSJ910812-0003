Not John Whiteside, a software engineer at DigitalEquipment Corp. He recently returned to his office after athree-week assignment and looked in horror at his flashingcomputer screen. Awaiting him were a mass of electronicmessages -- 1,000, to be exact.   &quot;It's some measure of our status how many messages we get,but after a while you just feel swamped,&quot; he says. Like manypeople, Mr. Whiteside has too much to read and not enoughtime to read it. While computers can be time savers, theyalso contribute to the information overload, along withnewspapers, general-interest magazines, professional journalsand Cable News Network, never mind books.   The result is an information squeeze: Careers and familycommitments consume ever more time, while the volume ofinformation that people need to absorb is growing. What'smore, the fear of falling behind has made information, likefood and exercise, one of America's basic guilt groups.   What to do?   Mr. Whiteside, who works in Digital's Nashua, N.H.,office, has taken steps to solve his electronic mailoverload. Each incoming message has a code that identifiesthe sender, so Mr. Whiteside has programmed his computer tosort through the missives like Robo-Mailman.   Messages from the company president, say, go into ahigh-priority electronic file, while announcements aboutcafeteria hours go to the bottom. Other messages are killedoutright. &quot;One person sends nothing but annoying jokes,&quot; Mr.Whiteside says. Those trifles are now deleted upon arrival.   Some executives use teamwork to keep ahead of theinformation curve. As head of the strategic planning divisionof Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank Corp., Kenneth R. Dubuquedidn't have time to read all the books he felt his jobrequired. So he asked his eight-member staff to read certaintitles, like Michael E. Porter's &quot;Competitive Advantage ofNations andamp; Their Firms&quot; and Peter J. Clark's &quot;Beyond the Deal:Optimizing Merger and Acquisition Value.&quot; Staff members thenwrote four- or five-page book reports.   &quot;I couldn't possibly read all these books,&quot; says Mr.Dubuque, who was recently named chairman of Mellon's Marylandbanking subsidiary. &quot;But if the books were interestingenough, we'd present {the book reports} at staff meetings.&quot;   Keeping up is particularly difficult for politicians. &quot;Idoubt there was ever a time that a congressman could feelwell-informed about every issue before him,&quot; says Rep. JohnRhodes of Arizona. &quot;But we're at a point where we're lessinformed about more and more that comes before us.&quot;   There's no easy answer, he says, so he, like everyoneelse, finds ways to make do. &quot;I'm blessed because I'm fromArizona, and it takes six or seven hours to get there,&quot; hesays. &quot;I never get on an airplane without a briefcase full ofpapers.   Many big shots hire people to scan newspapers andmagazines, go through the mail and generally decide what theyneed to read. At some companies, staff members assemblepackets of important articles from a variety of publicationsand distribute them to top managers.   But for overwhelmed executives, these siphoning processesare like bailing out the Titanic with a tea cup.   &quot;There's no end to the proliferation of paper andinformation,&quot; laments Gerald Mayo, chairman of Midland MutualLife Insurance Co. in Columbus, Ohio. Mr. Mayo, who is alsochairman of the local Chamber of Commerce, says his staffthrows out or refers to other people 50% of his mail -- buthe still gets three inches of it a day, not includingnewspapers and magazines.   He now skims newspapers more than he used to and hasvirtually given up pleasure reading. &quot;I get Golf Digest, butI haven't looked at anything but the cover for at least ayear,&quot; he says.   In general, the best way to avoid being overwhelmed is towork with a clear purpose. &quot;People really suffer when they'rein an organization that has no sense of direction, whereeverything is relevant,&quot; says John Kotter, a professor atHarvard Business School. &quot;It helps enormously if you can lookat things and say, `irrelevant, irrelevant, irrelevant -- ah,relevant.'&quot;   It also helps to have a system for handling the paperflow. Stephanie Winston, a professional organizer based inNew York, says one client, an advertising executive, was sodisorganized that she was known as the Bermuda Triangle. SoMs. Winston advised her to use the &quot;TRAF&quot; system whensomething crossed her desk: Throw it out, refer it, act on itor file it.   &quot;There are two types of clutter -- benign and malign,&quot; shesays. &quot;If you're TRAFing, then you have benign clutter onyour desk because you have a fundamental system for disposingof your papers. But if your papers are random, then you havemalign clutter.&quot;   Technology can also help organize. Judi Albertson, whoworks as a computer trainer and analyst for a Wall Streetbrokerage firm, can set up her computer screen tosimultaneously monitor a slew of information: governmentsecurity and foreign currency prices, market indicators,Treasury and foreign fund rates and news services, amongothers.   When a stock price goes up, the number flashes green; whenit goes down, red. Ms. Albertson's computer also has faxingcapabilities and can provide access to a variety of newswires and an electronic bulletin board.   &quot;All day long information is coming at you,&quot; she says, butnow she is able to put on one screen what used to fill upfour.   Computer experts say progress has already been made increating &quot;multimedia&quot; personal computers, which will be ableto accept written and voice messages and graphic images. Thesame computers will also be able to retrieve articles onparticular subjects from a wide range of publications,effectively creating a personalized newpaper.   Some people use their leisure time to stay current. PeteFilippone, an otolaryngologist in Houston, has bought 194medical cassette tapes covering such issues as how to treatpediatric swallowing problems and croup. Dr. Filippone playsthe tapes in his Walkman while he's jogging and puts them inthe tape deck of his car while he's driving.   &quot;I'm more of an audio-visual type person,&quot; he says.&quot;Writing is the same -- stats, surveys, results. It's kind ofboring. But when you're driving along, the tapes are like aguy talking to you.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
