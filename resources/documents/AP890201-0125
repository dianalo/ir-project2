U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell suggested the action``appears to be a deliberate effort to obstruct'' the selection ``ofa jury in this case.''   Gesell said that on the broadcast, ABC correspondent Tim O'Brien``took pains'' to tell viewers that if they looked at his broadcastof excerpts of testimony North gave Congress in 1987 under immunity,they would not have to serve on the jury.   Gesell said he has ``not made up my mind'' as to whether theincident provides an ``appropriate basis for a contempt action.''   O'Brien was not in the courtroom as Gesell spoke.   ``I really am quite puzzled by it,'' ABC's Washington bureauchief, George Watson, said of the judge's statement. ``Tim O'Brienreported fairly and accurately what has been said in public, inpublic testimony by Col. North. And last night we and other newsorganizations reported that in explaining the case and how it cameto trial.''   ``Our only deliberate effort is to accurately and fairly reporton the trial of Col. North,'' Watson said.   The judge's comments underscored the difficulty of selecting ajury at North's trial.   Immediately after Gesell's comments, the judge disqualified awoman who was employed at a Sears, Roebuck store in Washington frombeing a potential juror in the North case because she worked in thebasement where dozens of TV sets were turned on when North wastestifying to Congress in July 1987.   The woman said she ``heard something'' about North shreddingdocuments, but it was unclear from her answer whether she hadactually seen those references as North testified or heard newsaccounts of it later.   Defense attorney Brendan Sullivan said he shops at thatparticular Sears store and that there are ``hundreds of TVs'' in thebasement where the woman works in the housewares department.   Later in the morning, Gesell added four other people to the poolof potential jurors, bringing the total to 11 of the 50 the judgewants to have from which to choose.   One was a postal clerk who said it would be a financial hardshipfor her to serve on a jury because she was working part-time andwould not be paid while she was absent. Gesell said he mightintervene to make arrangements.   A second was a laboratory technician. Gesell brushed asidedefense objections that the woman had seen North testifying toCongress on TV, but she said she had not heard what he said.   ``I have to take into account your client was on TV a great dealunder all kinds of circumstances,'' the judge told defenseattorneys. ``She did say she saw him, but she did not say she heardhim.''   The third person chosen, an Army veteran of the Vietnam war, saidhe could not recognize North, who sat across the courtroom.   The fourth was a woman who has been a Pentagon mail clerk for thepast 16 years who said she had heard North was ``going to trial''but ``didn't really pay attention'' to what the charges were. Shesaid she had been ``on vacation in Canada'' during the first part ofNorth's televised congressional testimony in 1987.   Meanwhile, North's lawyers say any jury in the Iran-Contra caseshould be kept in isolation for the entire time the fired WhiteHouse aide is on trial, which could be for five months.   A request to sequester the jury was made by Sullivan on Tuesday,the opening day of North's trial, as Gesell qualified seven peopleto be part of a pool of potential jurors.   Sullivan said that ``in the event a jury can be empaneled, itshould be sequestered immediately to minimize the potential forexposure to immunized testimony and to protect Lt. Col. North'sconstitutional rights.''   At a Jan. 9 hearing, prosecutor John Keker estimated it wouldtake six to eight weeks to present evidence against North whileSullivan estimated it would take two to three months to present thedefense's case.   North faces 12 felony counts including lying to Congress in 1985and 1986 to cover up Reagan administration assistance to theNicaraguan Contra rebels during a period in which Congress hadbanned U.S. aid to the insurgents.   North's lawyers have said that no jury can be empaneled thatwould provide him with a fair trial because the former NationalSecurity Council aide later testified about his activities innationally televised hearings before Congress in 1987.   In that testimony, North detailed many of his activities, such asshredding documents and cashing travelers' checks intended for theContras, for which he is now accused of crimes.   ``There has been repeated, widespread dissemination of Lt. Col.North's immunized testimony for more than 18 months,'' said Sullivan.   North appeared before Congress under a limited grant of immunity,meaning the testimony itself could not be used to prosecute him.However, under the arrangement, special prosecutor Lawrence Walshwas allowed to gather much of the same information independently.   Over protests from North attorney Barry Simon, Gesell on Tuesdayapproved seven potential jurors out of an initial group of 54.   One of the seven, a retired postal clerk, said she paid as muchattention to North's televised testimony as she paid to ``The ThreeStooges.'' She said her house had burned down and she was occupiedat the time with itemizing household items that had been lost.   Another potential juror approved by Gesell has a son who deliversnewspapers for The Washington Post. Simon objected that the womanmust have seen headlines during North's testimony. But Gesell placedher in the jury pool after being assured that she would cut off herson's conversation if he ever starts talking about the North case.   An unemployed man looking for work as a security guard also wasordered into the jury pool. He said he saw North on televisionduring the congressional hearings but knew nothing about him.   Simon objected to the selection, saying that ``if he heard evenone'' small portion of North's testimony, ``which he very easilycould have,'' he should be disqualified.   In addition to charges that he lied to Congress, North is accusedof lying to the attorney general about his role in divertingmillions of dollars to the Contras from the Reagan administration'ssecret weapons sales to Iran.   He also is accused of ilegally accepting a $13,800 securitysystem at his home from co-defendant Richard Secord, converting tohis own use at least $4,300 in traveler's checks from Contra leaderAdolfo Calero and conspiring to defraud the Treasury of tax revenueby using a tax-exempt foundation to funnel money to the Contras.</TEXT></DOC>
