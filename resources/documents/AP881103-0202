Rafael Samudio Molina saidat a funeral for 11 soldiers killed in a guerrilla ambush Tuesday.   ``As commander of the armed forces I exhort every single soldierin a total offensive to destroy the enemy, eliminate him, wipe outhis will to fight,'' Samudio said.   There are an estimated 10,000 leftist guerrillas in Colombia,whose population of 30 million. More than 75,000 people have beenkilled in 15 years of insurrection.   Colombia's armed forces have held back from an all-out waragainst the guerrillas during off-and-on peace talks between thegovernment and the rebels over the last six years.   The army recently bought eight Blackhawk army helicopter gunshipsfrom the United States for its anti-guerrilla forces.   Samudio, apparently speaking with the support of PresidentVirgilio Barco, said there was no use trying to negotiate with theguerrillas.   The guerrillas rejected a peace plan proposed last month byBarco, who offered pardons to all guerrillas who would surrender andsaid he would let rebel leaders address Congress on changes thatshould be made in Colombia.   Barco's predecessor, President Belisario Betancur, launched peacetalks with the guerrillas in 1982. The talks collapsed amid mutualaccusations by the rebels and the military of cease-fire violations.   In 50 separate actions last month, rebels raided towns andmilitary bases, ambushed army patrols and blew up bridges and hightension electricity towers.   By Defense Ministry count, 56 soldiers and policemen, 26civilians and 123 rebels were killed.</TEXT></DOC>
