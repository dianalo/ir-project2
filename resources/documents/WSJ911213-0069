Mr. Grosz lives in Chicago.   San Jacinto Savings, which was based in Houston, was takenover by federal thrift regulators a year ago and was sold inlate September to United Savings Association of Texas,Houston. The thrift's failure is expected to cost taxpayersabout $1.42 billion. The thrift was one of the largest unitsof Southmark Corp., Dallas, a financial services concern thatcollapsed in bankruptcy in 1989 and is now liquidating.   The indictment specifically accuses Mr. Grosz ofauthorizing San Jacinto Savings to make $43.5 million ofartificially inflated loans to a borrower who then returned$1.6 million from the loan proceeds to a company partiallyowned by Mr. Grosz. The indictment alleges that Mr. Groszused part of the loan proceeds to purchase stock in anIllinois thrift.   The borrower, James P. McClain of Dallas, previouslypleaded guilty to two charges of conspiring to commit bankfraud. He is cooperating with the U.S. Justice Department'sBank Fraud Task Force in the case against Mr. Grosz and twoformer officers of the now-defunct Peoples Heritage FederalSavings andamp; Loan Association, which was in Salina, Kan.   Peoples Heritage's former president, James R. Cruce, andformer senior executive vice president, Thomas A. Burger,were indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury in Dallas onbank fraud charges related to $13.6 million of loans to Mr.McClain and his companies to buy Dallas-area real estate.   Mr. Grosz, also a borrower at Peoples Federal, wasacquitted earlier this year of bank fraud charges filed infederal court in Kansas in connection with the loans.   Messrs. Cruce and Burger, who pleaded guilty to federalbank fraud charges in Kansas, are currently serving federalprison sentences of 14 years and 12 years, respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
