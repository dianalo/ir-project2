This case-controlstudy was designed to assess the relation between residential exposureto magnetic fields and the development of childhood cancer. Eligiblecases consisted of all 356 residents of the five-county 1970 Denver,Colorado Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area aged 0-14 years who werediagnosed with any form of cancer between 1976 and 1983. Controls wereselected by random digit dialing to approximate the case distributionby age, sex, and telephone exchange area. Exposure was characterizedthrough in-home electric and magnetic field measurements under low andhigh power use conditions and wire configuration codes, a surrogate measureof long-term magnetic field levels. Measured magnetic fields under lowpower use conditions had a modest association with cancer incidence;a cutoff score of 2.0 milligauss resulted in an odds ratio of 1.4 (95%confidence interval (CI) = 0.6-2.9) for total cancers and somewhat largerodds ratios (ORs) for leukemias (OR = 1.9), lymphomas (OR = 2.2), andsoft tissue sarcomas (OR = 3.3). Neither magnetic fields (OR = 1.0) norelectric fields (OR = 0.9) under high power use conditions were relatedto total cancers. Wire codes associated with higher magnetic fields weremore common among case than control homes. The odds ratio to contrastvery high and high to very low, low, and buried wire codes was 1.5 (95%CI = 1.0-2.3) for total cases, with consistency across cancer subgroupsexcept for brain cancer (OR = 2.0) and lymphomas (OR = 0.8). Contrastsof very high to buried wire code homes produced larger, less preciseodds ratios of 2.3 for total cases, 2.9 for leukemias, and 3.3 for lymphomas.</TEXT></DOC>
