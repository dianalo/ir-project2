A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows only one inthree voters regard him as clearly a strong leader -- and thenumber of people saying they currently plan to vote for himnext year has dipped below 50%. &quot;No longer can foreign policyalone sustain him in tough economic times,&quot; say Democraticpollster Peter Hart and Republican pollster Robert Teeter,who conducted the survey.</LP><TEXT>   After Bush returns from next month's Japan trip, aides seehim gradually unveiling elements of his economic program tobuild consensus before the State of the Union address. Butthe poll shows only 18% have confidence in Bush's handling ofthe economy, while 47% lack confidence.   While Democratic candidates tout &quot;outsider&quot; credentials,voters by 54% to 32% prefer an experienced Washington hand tosomeone who isn't part of the establishment.                                                                                                          GLOOMY VOTERS say they want fresh faces in next year'scongressional races.   The Journal/NBC survey finds 68% of voters think things inthe nation are on the wrong track, the most pessimistic moodof the Bush presidency. Only 9% are very confident that lifefor their children will be better than for them, while 51%aren't at all confident. And 63% see the country in a stateof decline -- a jump of 10 points just since October.   In voting for Congress next year, 52% say it would bebetter to &quot;give a new person a chance;&quot; two years ago, aplurality said their representative deserved re-election. ButRepublicans shouldn't be too hopeful: Voters give Democrats a33%-27% edge in voting intentions for next year'scongressional elections.                                                                                                          SENTIMENT SWINGS against Israel, further endangering itsloan guarantees.   After years of strong support for Israel, U.S. voters havebeen evenly divided over whether it or the Arabs are thebiggest obstacle to peace. The new poll, though, finds theynow blame Israel by 41% to 29%. In the current atmosphere,pro-Israel forces have all but given up on getting theirdesperately-sought $10 billion loan guarantee in one shot;they now hope to win a one-year installment of $2 billion.   Shamir, like Bush, faces an election next year, and isunlikely to agree to a settlements freeze. But he might tryto turn his budget squeeze into a virtue: Money for newhousing is expected to fall sharply, so he could point to abig cut in planned building in the occupied territories.   By almost two-to-one, voters don't think the Mideast talkswill lead to peace -- but by 55% to 40% believe the U.S.should try anyway.                                                                                                          IRAQ EXPORTS &quot;massive quantities&quot; of constructionequipment to Iran, and is sending fuel to Turkey, a SenateForeign Relations Committee report says. The sales provideSaddam Hussein with hard currency to buy food, medicine andother goods from Jordan. By two to one, U.S. voters stillbelieve the war with Iraq ended too soon.                                                                                                          CONSUMERS CONTINUE to forecast a bleak Christmas. In thepoll, only 9% say they plan to spend more on shopping thisyear than last, while 47% plan to spend less. One result: Thegovernment says hiring of extra workers in retail stores hasbeen &quot;considerably short of seasonal expectations.&quot;   BUSH'S LEAD over Cuomo, his strongest potential Democraticfoe, narrows to 54%-35% from 67%-22% last spring. Thepresident enjoys a lead of better than two to one in theSouth -- but the two run neck-and-neck in the Northeast.                                                                                                          VEEPSTAKES: Larry Rockefeller, a lawyer and a nephew ofNelson Rockefeller, meets with liberal Republicans today todiscuss a New Hampshire primary challenge to Quayle. TheJournal/NBC poll refutes the Washington perception thatQuayle has turned a corner with the voters: He is stillviewed positively by only 32%, while 38% view him negatively.                                                                                                          NEXT YEAR LOOMS as one of bickering and posturing onhealth care.   Both parties are riven by internal discord on how toproceed. Senate Finance Chairman Bentsen, who favors acautious approach, was conspicuously absent from this week'straveling health-care roadshow orchestrated by MajorityLeader Mitchell. Republicans have failed to coalesce aroundany proposals yet; many are waiting to hear what Bush says inthe State of the Union.   The poll finds voters willing to embrace Big Government intheir search for a solution: 41% would favor a universal planadministered by the government, while another 31% would favora plan requiring coverage using existing structures. Fewerthan one in five would leave the current system unchanged.And two-thirds favor requiring all employers regardless ofsize to provide insurance for their workers.   Given the huge stakes, the American Hospital Associationmoves its president's office here from Chicago.                                                                                                          MINOR MEMOS: Only 15% -- down from 34% in September 1990-- believe they could get more for their home today than theycould have a year earlier. . . . Despite the stunning victoryin the Persian Gulf War, voters by 55% to 14% regard 1991 asa bad year for the U.S.</TEXT></DOC>
