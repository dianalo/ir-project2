(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The county Planning Commission hasnullified a permit allowing two oil companies to begin pumping crudeoil and natural gas from three recently completed offshore platforms.   The commission invalidated the permit because the companies _Chevron USA and Texaco Inc. _ underestimated concentrations ofpoisonous hydrogen sulfide in the natural gas, county officials said.   Tuesday's decision could delay production from the offshore oilplatforms for as long as a year, assuming a new permit is issued.   The oil companies will appeal the commission's ruling to thecounty Board of Supervisors, Chevron lawyer Ralph Mayo said. AChevron official estimated each day's delay in opening the platformscould cost both companies a combined $500,000.   Chevron and Texaco have invested a combined $2 billion on theplatforms, pipelines leading onshore near Point Conception and oiland gas processing plants at nearby Gaviota.   At the processing plants, impurities would be removed from thecrude oil and hydrogen sulfide would be removed from the natural gasbefore shipment to a refinery.   Two of the platforms were to be operated by Chevron and one byTexaco.   The permit for pumping oil and gas was issued in 1985 based onfindings that average concentrations of hydrogen sulfide in the gaswould run about 7,000 parts per million.   But it was later determined that the actual number is closer to15,000 parts per million. That finding led to Tuesday's 5-0 vote bythe planning commission to nullify the permit.   The finding means a considerably larger area would be exposed tolethal levels of the gas during a leak, according to Diane Guzman,director of the county's Resource Management Department.   The companies had planned to process eventually up to 200,000barrels of crude oil a day and 120 million standard cubic feet ofnatural gas.</TEXT></DOC>
