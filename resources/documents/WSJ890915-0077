The first issue of Country America, the magazine of the country-oriented cable-TV channel, went on sale this week with a run of about 400,000 copies. The introduction follows last week's announcement by Capital Cities/ABC Inc. that it has been testing its own magazine to promote daytime soaps on its ABC network.    Country America, which bills itself as a &quot;magazine for those who enjoy the country way of life and country music,&quot; crisscrosses the boundaries between electronic and print media. Its structure permits a dizzying loop of &quot;cross-media merchandising&quot; opportunities, including what appear to be the first-ever ads inside ads.    Country America is a venture between the Nashville Network, the closely held operation whose owners also run Opryland USA; Group W Satellite Communications, the Westinghouse Electric Co. unit that markets and distributes the network's offerings to 46 million U.S. households; and Meredith Corp., the Des Moines, Iowa, publisher of Ladies' Home Journal, Better Homes and Gardens and a host of other home-and-craft-oriented magazines.    The country-radio network jointly owned by Group W and the Nashville Network touts the magazine, which itself is stuffed with promos for the Nashville Network. The network in turn carries ads plugging the new magazine -- through spots called &quot;The Country America Minute.&quot; But only half of the minute is spent touting the magazine, with the rest filled by two 15-second inserts that, the network says, &quot;showcase advertisers' print creatives.&quot; Under that unusual approach, viewers are shown pictures of printed ads appearing in a magazine they're being asked to buy.    Nashville Network and Group W dreamed up Country America as a way to bolster interest in the country network, and to publish the channel's listings at a time when the outpouring of cable fare makes it difficult for many viewers to know what's on. They then brought their brainchild to Meredith, which controls editorial content and prints the magazine.    Country America, which costs $1.95 on the newsstands, was designed to stand on its own. Indeed, it devotes about 80% of its coverage to country &quot;life style&quot; matters -- the October issue takes a look at a national storytelling festival, fall fishing in the Ozarks and a feature on autumn cooking, among other things. A spokeswoman for the venture notes that such folksy topics are &quot;consistent with our mix on the network,&quot; which beams to viewers shows about fishing, traveling in recreational vehicles and country cooking, in addition to plaintive country crooners.    A minimum 20% of each month's features relate to country music -- the network's bread and butter. And each issue will carry an eight-page program guide to the network's offerings.    Says the venture's spokeswoman, &quot;Advertisers want value-added advertising,&quot; instead of simply buying 30-second spots. &quot;They want involvement in programming, or involvement like this, in a magazine.&quot;    &quot;Country America and the Nashville Network complement each other editorially and in audience,&quot; says the magazine's publisher, James Gabal. In a release, he calls the free TV plug for qualifying magazine advertisers &quot;a package that can't be matched by any other buy.&quot;    In the planned Capital Cities/ABC magazine, it's understood that ABC will offer ad packages that tie in daytime commercial time with pages in the magazine, and the network will peddle subscriptions to the publication, to be called Episodes, during ad breaks. </TEXT></DOC>
