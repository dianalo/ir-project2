Most involve either developing an estimator robust to theasymmetry, or transforming the data to create a more symmetric distribution.In these cases the true mean of the underlying population is not preserved;rather, quantities such as the median are estimated. There are situations,however, in which the mean is really the quantity of interest. For example,in neutron transport problems the energies of individual particles aremeasured. Primary interest may be in total energy: this is merely a rescalingof mean energy per particle. This report details some efforts to developmean estimation techniques in large samples of highly skewed data. 3refs., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
