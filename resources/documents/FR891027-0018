This notice addressesnew scientific information in the fishery and recent developments thathave occurred in the fishery. The intended effect of the new specificationsis to allow continued development of the hake fisheries of the NorthwesternAtlantic that will be conducted to support joint ventures (JV) involvingU.S. hake fishermen to produce net benefit to the United States.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> November 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> E. Martin Jaffe, (Resource ManagementSpecialist), 508-281-9272.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> NOAA published a proposed rule to amendfishery specifications on April 5, 1989, to present the optimum yield (OY),domestic annual harvest (DAH), domestic annual processing (DAP), JVP, reserve,and the total allowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF) for the hake fisheries(54 FR 13704) with request for public comment. A foreign fishing application for a silver hake JV with vessels of theSoviet Union was received after publication of the proposed rule. NOAApublished a notice of extension of the comment period on May 2, 1989, (54FR 18683) extending the comment period through May 15, 1989, to allow sufficienttime for comments from industry and the public to address the recent interestin JVP. The JV application involves silver hake in the N. Georges/Gulfof Maine (GOM) area. The NMFS reassessment affirms that the DAP for the N. Georges/GOM silverhake is appropriate to satisfy the domestic processing sector and thatsufficient U.S. harvest is available to approve a JV. Based on this review,NMFS specifies an appropriate amount of JVP for N. Georges/GOM by transferring3,000 metric tons of silver hake from reserve. While this specificationincreases the DAH by 3,000 metric tons, it does not modify the DAP. The specifications for hake fisheries in the Northeast Region, NorthwesternAtlantic Ocean, are revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>9,L2,i1,s25,8,r25,8,8,8,6,8,6 </C><T4>Northwestern Atlantic Hake Fisheries </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[In metric tons (mt)]</ITAG><H1>Species </H1><H1>Species code </H1><H1>Area </H1><H1>OY </H1><H1>DAH </H1><H1>DAP </H1><H1>JVP </H1><H1>Reserve </H1><H1>TALFF</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Hake, Silver <D>104 </D><D>S.

A grouprepresenting Gloucester, MA processors also commented in a meeting withthe NMFS Northeast Regional Director. The Gloucester Fisheries Associationand the group representing the local processors (the processors) opposethe JV while Mayflower International, Ltd. and the Cape Ann Vessel Associationsupport it.<T3>Comment: </T3>The processors asked if the silver hake purchased bythe foreign JV partner would be sold in the United States. <T3>Response: </T3>The vessels of the Soviet Union expect to process thefish into fillets and fishmeal. The application for JV states that theexpected market is the Soviet Union and that the products are not expectedto enter the United States. <T3>Comment: </T3>The processors asked what will happen to the by-catch.<T3>Response: </T3>Their application for JV states that the foreign fishingvessels will not exceed the incidental harvest limits established by theregulations. They further agreed to return any by-catch to the U.S. harvestingvessels if requested. <T3>Comment: </T3>The processors and the Gloucester Fisheries Associationexpressed their concern with the possibility of the JV taking groundfish.The processors were concerned with effects of the JV on groundfishing in1989, and the Gloucester Fisheries Association asked if there would bea JV next year for groundfish. <T3>Response: </T3>As stated in 50 CFR 611.11(c), all species of fish whicha foreign fishing vessel has not been allocated or authorized to retain,including fish caught or received in excess of any allocation or authorization,are prohibited species which must be returned promptly to the ocean. Further,it is unlikely that the foreign fishing vessels will encounter groundfish(e.g., cod or haddock) because of the known low concentration of multi-speciesgroundfish in that portion of N. Georges Bank/GOM known as Cultivator Shoals.Also, there is no JVP for groundfish, nor is one expected given the capacityof the domestic processing sector. Thus, a JV for groundfish is not possible.<T3>Comment: </T3>Some small boat fishermen fear that U.S. vessels participatingin the JV will sell boxed whiting in the New York market. <T3>Response: </T3>The Cape Ann Vessel Association and Mayflower, Ltd.have conditioned participation of interested vessels in the JV upon theiragreement to refrain from boxing their catch and selling into the New Yorkmarket. <ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, determined that this actionappears to be necessary for the conservation and management of the hakefisheries governed by the PMP prepared by the Secretary and that it isconsistent with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MagnusonAct) and other applicable law. This action does not result in a significant change in the original environmentalaction and is categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare anenvironmental assessment pursuant to NOAA Directive 02-10. The Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, NOAA, determined that thisis not a ``major rule'' requiring a regulatory impact analysis under ExecutiveOrder 12291 because it would not have an annual effect on the economy of$100 million or more; would not result in an increase in costs or pricesfor consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local governmentagencies, or geographic regions; and would not result in significant adverseeffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. The General Counsel of the Departmentof Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration that this willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities because it does not regulate domestic fishing interests. As aresult, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. This rule does not contain a collection of information requirement forpurposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act. This rule will be implemented in a manner that does not directly affectthe approved coastal zone management programs of Maine, New Hampshire,Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware,Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Management measures in the PMP are not likely to affect endangered speciesor marine mammals. This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under Executive Order12612. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 611 </ITAG>Fisheries, Foreign relations, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 20, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
