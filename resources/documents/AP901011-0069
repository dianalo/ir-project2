Ohio Lottery spokeswoman Anne Bloomberg said the lotterycouldn't confirm the winner's identity until a formal claim wasmade and validated at an Ohio Lottery office.   The ticket is the second-most valuable in the history of U.S.lotteries. Florida's lottery had a $55.2 million winning ticket onSept. 3, 1988. There have been larger lottery prizes, but they weresplit among multiple ticketholders.   The lone winning ticket is worth $1,923,077 a year for 26 years,before taxes, and was purchased in Conneaut, a small city at Ohio'snortheast tip near Pennsylvania, lottery officials said.   Richard Hovis, 37, told television station WSEE in Erie he wasthe winner.   ``We saw the ticket and the numbers on it. It was a little bitcrumpled, but the numbers were there,'' Pierre Bellicini of WSEEsaid.   Hovis told the station in an interview: ``I'm going to take careof the folks first, pay some debts, then redo my bathroom and maybeBondo my Pinto.'' Bondo is a substance used to patch rust holes.   Hovis, a warehouse manager at Erie Manufacturing andamp; Supply Co.,told co-workers today he had the winning ticket and submitted atwo-week notice of resignation, said Dan Wlodarczyk, the company'spurchasing and sales manager.   Company president Cy Wellman said he arranged for Hovis totravel to Cleveland to validate the ticket.   ``It's crazy,'' Wellman said. ``It's our 100th anniversary as acompany Nov. 1. We decided the best way to celebrate was to haveone of our employees win $50 million. I feel fortunate. Rick is awonderful guy and you have to feel terrific for any individual whowins $50 million.''   The high jackpot created long lines at Ohio Lottery salesoutlets Wednesday.   The lottery sold $15,299,601 worth of tickets for Wednesdaynight's televised drawing. The winning numbers were 3, 17, 28, 41,46 and 49.</TEXT></DOC>
