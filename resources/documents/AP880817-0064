If in our society we can afford to givetax deductions and credits to working parents with children, wealso can afford to give tax deductions and credits to women whowant to stay at home and care for their children.   No. 5 _ The goal of welfare must be to restore people in crisisto dignity and useful employment, not to create a class ofgovernment dependents for whom welfare is a way of life. Whateverthe Democrats may tell you, that is not the way to ``keep hopealive.''   But hope is very much alive in America today. It is alivebecause our vision, the Republican vision, expresses the hopes andthe dreams of the vast majority of the American people.   As we leave New Orleans, we will go back to our homes confidentthat we are a party united around a platform that expresses theAmerican spirit _ a platform we can be proud to share with ourneighbors all over this great nation.   And now, I would like to give a personal message to the millionsof Americans, voters, volunteers, and supporters across this nationwho committed themselves to my campaign. I thank you. I am veryproud of you. And now the time has come for you to make your choice.   This party is about to nominate as its presidential candidate aman that I have come to respect and admire. Today we have learnedof the selection of Sen. Dan Quayle as his running mate.   Dan Quayle beat the liberal Birch Bayh to get a seat fromIndiana in the United States Senate. Only a few members of theSenate can claim his distinguished record of support for theReagan-Bush agenda. He is a staunch defender of freedom, a championof family values and a common sense Hoosier who understands theneeds of the farmer and the working man.   He is young, vigorous and capable.   Ladies and gentlemen, the George Bush-Dan Quayle ticket can andwill lead our nation proudly into the future.   Therefore, tonight I release my delegates and alternates whohave come to this convention and urge you and all of my friendsacross America to give your enthusiastic support to our party, toour platform and our presidential and vice presidential nominees.   As we cast our eyes toward November, we know that a new page ofhistory will be written.   On that page we will inscribe the name of the 41st president ofthe United States.   His name will be George Bush, Republican.   Thank you, and God bless you.</TEXT><HEAD>End Robertson Text _ 7 Takes</HEAD></DOC>
