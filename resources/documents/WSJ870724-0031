The utility recently canceled plans to sell long-term debt and said it was working on an alternative plan. As previously reported, the alternative plan is likely to include a proposal to swap debt outstanding for new securities that pay little if any cash interest.    PS New Hampshire owns 35.6% of the problem-plagued Seabrook nuclear plant, licensing of which is stalled by controversy over evacuation plans.    In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the utility said, &quot;Given the uncertainties surrounding the company, its limited financial flexiblity, the amount of debt service which the company can reasonably expect to carry, the political, economic and competitive limits on rate increases in New Hampshire, and the regulatory approvals that will be required, it will be extremely difficult to develop and implement . . . a plan within the limited time available.&quot;    If a restructuring isn't completed by the end of 1987, the company added, &quot;it will be difficult, if not impossible, for the company to avoid proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code.&quot;    PS New Hampshire escaped a threatened bankruptcy-law filing three years ago by suspending common and preferred dividends, borrowing money and selling high-yield junk bonds. But uncertainty over Seabrook's future has made it nearly impossible for the utility to borrow more money on Wall Street to pay interest on previously issued debt.    PS New Hampshire closed at $4.50, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.    Daniel Frank, manager of Fidelity Special Situations, a $300 million mutual fund that has about 1% of its assets in Public Service securities, said bondholders are likely to try to help the utility avoid a bankruptcy-law filing.    &quot;If you saw a glimmer of hope from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, from Congress, from the Public Utilities Commission, the bondholders would feel much more comfortable. That would facilitate the restructuring. Today, we don't have any of that. But I think those signs will be evident within the next six months,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
