If I were asexcitable as the senator from Maine, I'd now be tapping out abook called &quot;World on Ice.&quot;   The only unambiguous fact presented here to undergird theauthor's doomsday scenario is that the summer of 1988 in thecapital was a scorcher. Of course, Sen. Mitchell could havebeen a sport and simply headed for the Delaware shore. Butno, duty called, and he sweated out this stinker of a book.</LP><TEXT>   Judging by his febrile pitch, this much is certain: GeorgeMitchell's world is on fire. The senator foresees nothingless than &quot;complete ecological collapse.&quot; Acid rain, thegreenhouse effect, rifts in the ozone layer and destructionof rain forest are &quot;the four horsemen of the apocalypse.&quot;(And I thought they were Sen. Mitchell, Joe Biden, TeddyKennedy and Howard Metzenbaum.)   Sen. Mitchell pursues this puerile personificationthroughout the book. Chlorofluorocarbons are &quot;eating&quot; theozone layer. Acid rain's hydrogen ions are &quot;body snatchersfrom another planet.&quot; We face &quot;villain gases and theiraccomplices&quot; and the &quot;inexorable march of the desert.&quot; Thedevice leads the author to awkward formulations, as when hewrites of &quot;silent stalkers killing our water, our air. . . .&quot;   The hysterical tone comes as something of a surprise froma politician whose public persona is more that of a naysayingold auntie than a shrill Chicken Little. Perhaps theshrillness is nothing more than an attempt to resuscitate atext that otherwise reads like an elementary-school geographylesson: &quot;In two million B.C., there were perhaps 100,000food-gathering bipeds on earth.&quot; &quot;Two hundred million yearsago what is now Antarctica was part of a large supercontinentknown as Gonwanaland.&quot;   True, it's a mite unfair to expect much in the way ofprose style from politicianauthors. Suspension of minimalliterary standards, however, is harder to forgive. The bookfloats on analytical soap bubbles. What scant research thesenator appears to have done is poorly annotated; quotes areattributed mysteriously to &quot;one Third World general&quot; or a&quot;speaker at a 1972 conference in Nairobi.&quot;   When an opinion is identified properly as to source, itunfailingly hails from one of two institutions leasthospitable to good sense: a scary-sounding arm of the UnitedNations or Harvard University. No attempt is made even tosummarize, much less rebut, views contrary to those of theEarth First, one-world radicals.   Curiously unmentioned here is the most exhaustive (andcongressionally mandated) look at the acid-rain phenomenon,in which a scientific panel recently found that the nation'slakes and forests are not endangered. Almost any reader alsowill know of serious scientific disagreement about whetherglobal temperatures are rising significantly, and whether theozone layer is at an abnormally low level.   Sen. Mitchell seems to resent such informed skepticism:&quot;We cannot afford to take a chance. We must continue toassume that the planet is under siege and act accordingly.&quot;How come? Does soothsayer Joan Quigley have a new client?   If nothing else, the book is an apt illustration of ourtopsy-turvy environmental politics: When the self-appointednature police decide &quot;something must be done,&quot; the evidencebe damned. For instance, Sen. Mitchell imagines the horrificresults of a three- to five-foot rise in the sea level --&quot;Miami would be reclaimed by swamp&quot; -- but gives noindication of whether anyone is predicting such a rise, orhow soon. Another hypothetical cataclysm -- rain foreststurning into grasslands -- is so sweeping it's meaningless.   Having failed utterly to ask the right technicalquestions, the author runs true to form in serving up mushypolitical answers. Noting that prohibitive job loss isimpeding coercive pollution-control schemes, Sen. Mitchellsagely announces, &quot;We must find a way around those problems,&quot;then drops the subject.   There is nary a word here about market-based incentivesdeployed against traditional command-and-control regulatorystrategies that already are working to enhance theenvironment without wrecking the economy. Lead levels ingasoline, for example, have been reduced drastically, andvoluntarily, under a Reagan-era program of tradable refinerypermits.   Instead, we get depressingly retrogade socialist andMalthusian boilerplate about &quot;income distribution&quot; and&quot;finite resources&quot;; a cameo appearance by noted ecologistMikhail Gorbachev; and, in an especially appalling passage, apaean to China's &quot;collectivized&quot; child-bearing policies. (Itis an added measure of how far today's liberalism has slunkfrom its moorings that Sen. Mitchell inveighs againstpopulation growth because it's happening &quot;not in New York,San Francisco or London,&quot; but in &quot;Kinshasha . . . Bombay . .. and Bogota.&quot;)   All of this, in the service of a final cliched call toarms: Now that the Cold War is over, a green war ofenvironmental protection must be waged. That may be so. Yetthe crooked stitch connecting the two in Sen. Mitchell'sframe is that in both cases the enemy is us, the capitalistWest. Considering the discreditable role of the senator andhis ideological soulmates in that last war -- remember the&quot;nuclear winter&quot; fandango? -- it's hard to imagine anyoneputting such a goofy gang in charge of this prospective one.   ---   Mr. Brock is an Olin fellow at the Heritage Foundation inWashington, D.C.</TEXT></DOC>
