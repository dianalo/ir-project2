(Products).andO;Product:   FoxPro 2.0 (Data base management system) (evaluation).andO;Topic:     EvaluationRelational DBMS.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>by Sal Ricciardi One of the biggest database stories of 1991 will be thearrival of FoxPro, Version 2.0, later this year.andP;  The package promises to topthe current version and further Fox's reputation for technical excellence.andO;While it's too soon to draw any final conclusions, our early peek at a betaversion convinced us that FoxPro 2.0 will be a significant competitor.andO;RUSHMORE TECHNOLOGY One of the most notable features of FoxPro 2.0 is the newRushmore query optimization technology.andP;  Rushmore uses a patent-pendingtechnique to improve dramatically the access of indexed data for certain&quot;optimizable &quot; queries.andP;  According to Fox, the results will yield access todata &quot;orders of magnitude&quot; faster under the right conditions.andP;  Fox hasdemonstrated that certain operations perform thousands of times faster usingthis technology.andM;The Rushmore technique works automatically with existing applications andindex files, but using it to the best advantage may require unlearning someof the tricks and techniques commonly used to improve performance.andP;  Forexample, in current applications, slower commands are often replaced byalternatives, sometimes several commands long, that produce the same resultsonly faster.andP;  With Rushmore technology, that practice will no longer benecessary-indeed, it should not be used because of Rushmore's ability tooptimize simple commands.andM;While Rushmore offers some spectacular opportunities,  FoxPro 2.0 seems quitefast even for operations that don't employ it.andP;  As an experiment, we ran ourbeta release of FoxPro 2.0 through our new relational database benchmarktests.andP;  The beta software completed the suite without errors and 21 percentfaster than FoxPro 1.02.andP;  (While this is notable, the testing of betasoftware makes these results useless, except as a point of curiosity.andO;Nevertheless, indications are that FoxPro 2.0 will be very fast.)andM;SQL users will no doubt take advantage of Fox's implementation of the SQLSELECT statement.andP;  With FoxPro 2.0, the SELECT command will be fullyintegrated with the command language and available at all times-there's nomode switch required.andP;  Since SELECT can perform operations that otherwiserequire several FoxPro commands, its use will be preferred in situations thatuse Rushmore because it will be easier for Rushmore to optimize.andP;  A newrelational query-by-example (RQBE) screen lets you enter information and haveFoxPro generate a SELECT statement for you.andP;  OPEN ARCHITECTURE Third-partydevelopers will be pleased by FoxPro's new open architecture.andP;  Version 2.0'snew external API provides access to much of FoxPro's internals.andP;  Using eitherC or assembler, developers can create external libraries of routines that aredynamically loaded and released as needed.andP;  With the API, programmers will beable to access databases, manipulate memory, process FoxPro statements andexpressions, and use FoxPro's windowing and video routines.andP;  The API willprovide access to FoxPro's event loop, letting developers handle FoxProevents and install custom event handlers.andM;You'll also be able to use some of FoxPro's interface enhancements in yourown programs-things like radio buttons, check boxes, and text edit regionsthat you often see in graphical applications.andP;  FoxPro 2.0 will support all ofthese through enhancements to the @ GET command and a new command, @ EDIT.andO;DEVELOPER'S TOOLS Designing screens that use these enhancements will be madeeasier by a new object-oriented Screen Builder, which is part of a trio oftools that include the Menu Builder and the Project Manager.andP;  The MenuBuilder will let you design, test, and generate code for menus, while theProject Manager will be almost a complete MAKE facility for programmers.andO;You'll be able to list screens, menus, programs, libraries, and basicallyeverything required for an application.andP;  Then the Project Manager will buildthe application.andM;The capability to build fully independent monolithic EXE's will be a functionof the Project Manager.andP;  It will be able to build.FXP applications thatrequire a runtime module, single.EXE files, or a series of executable filesthat rely on a central FoxPro library.andM;FoxPro 2.0 will also include new compound indexes that use a patent-pendingcompression technique to reduce index file size, a special extended-modeversion for 386 and 486 machines, and integrated template processing.andO;There's plenty to look forward to in Fox's next release.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
