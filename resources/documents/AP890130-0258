Patrick, acknowledging concerns on Capitol Hill about aproposal to revamp the way ATandamp;T sets its prices for interstateservices, on Monday postponed a decision on the plan until March.   A decision by the FCC on a so-called rate cap method of pricingfor American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s long-distance services hadbeen scheduled for Monday. But after members of Congress said theFCC may not have legal authority to make such a change, Patrickissued a statment prior to the meeting saying he would defer a voteuntil March to give lawmakers more time to study the plan.   ``Given the importance of this docket, the complexity of thedocket and in order to accommodate the interest in some additionalbriefings and the provision of some additional briefing information,I have agreed to reschedule this item for the meeting on March 16,''Patrick said at Monday's hearing.   ``I believe it is very important for the commission to craftregulations which will improve the incentives that are facingdominant carriers,'' Patrick said. ``On the other hand, the Congressis intensely interested in this docket. ... I would hope that in thespirit of the new administration that we can use this as afoundation to establish a more constructive dialogue with members onboth sides of the aisle with respect to this matter and othermatters that are pending before the commission.''   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy andCommerce Committee, which oversees telecommunications matters,welcomed Patrick's decision to delay.   ``I think the commission acted wisely,'' Dingell, who hadcriticized the FCC proposal, said in a statement. ``The Congress hada number of concerns about the impact of the price caps proposal andthe FCC appears to be addressing them. As the details of the planreceive public scrutiny and go through the congressional hearingprocess, I hope the spirit of cooperation with Congress willcontinue.''   Since the early 1960s, the government has allowed ATandamp;T a certainprofit beyond its costs. But the FCC proposed replacing thisso-called rate-of-return regulation for ``dominant carriers'' suchas ATandamp;T with ceilings on prices. That would include the sevenregional Bell companies that ATandamp;T spun off in 1984.   The commission said its proposal would encourage greaterefficiency and innovation and save customers $1.6 billion over fouryears if all the dominant companies participated. The FCC last Mayproposed that ATandamp;T be allowed to raise rates 3 percent less thanannual inflation.   ATandamp;T said in a statement it was ``disappointed and frustrated''by Patrick's deferral, and that every day a decision was delayed,``the public loses.''   BellSouth, one of the seven regional phone companies that wouldbe affected by the new pricing scheme, said ``the commission appearsto have stepped away from an opportunity to save telephone usersbillions of dollars.''   Another regional company, Bell Atlantic, said ``we are sorelydisappointed that the FCC and Congress have been unable to resolvetheir differences over how to best implement a price cap plan thatwill benefit consumers, the telecommunications industry and thenation.''   Lawmakers had been skeptical of the new plan.   ``As currently structured, the price cap scheme will permitcarriers to set prices that may deviate significantly from costs,''said a report last November from the Democratic staff of the HouseEnergy and Commerce telecommunications subcommittee.   ``There is no assurance that rates would remain even with a`zone' of reasonableness.''   On Jan. 19, in an attempt to allay lawmakers' concerns, Patricksent a letter and supporting documents to the chairman of thetelecommunications panel, Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., and toDingell.   He assured Markey and Dingell that the price cap proposal had notbeen rushed through by his staff and that he had recommended anumber of changes in the plan, including a delay in implementing theproposal for the regional Bell companies and other local exchangecarriers.   He said he also would recommend establishing separate price cap``baskets'' for ATandamp;T's business and residential customers to preventthe company from raising residential prices to finance ratereductions for businesses.   He also proposed an ``automatic stabilizer,'' which he said wouldoperate to ensure that local carriers' earnings ``remain within thezone of reasonableness and that consumers share in the efficiencygains price cap regulation is designed to generate.''</TEXT></DOC>
