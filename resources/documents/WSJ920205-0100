Although the study concluded that Zantac may increaseblood-alcohol levels of social drinkers, the study design didnot simulate in any way social-drinking situations that occurin the real world. The most obvious example is the way thealcohol was administered -- as a rapidly consumed, singledrink in the morning. Further, the study did not consider theeffect of circadian rhythms or meals on enzyme concentrationin the stomach, both of which affect absorption of alcohol ata time when most social drinking takes place.</LP><TEXT>   Most important, the study, which examined only eightpatients taking Zantac, is at variance with the majority ofwell-designed studies examining this claimed interaction.Taken together, these studies involved significantly largenumbers of patients, some of whom used larger doses ofalcohol.   As a matter of good medical practice, patients should notmix drugs and alcohol. However, while the study is ofinterest, we question its significance based on itsmythology, the substantial body of evidence against itshypothesis that has been previously published in the medicalliterature, and Zantac's 11 years of clinical use in morethan 170 million patient treatments.
