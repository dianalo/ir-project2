Monoclinic cell parameters are:a=10.084(2), b=14.129(2), c=11.553(2)A, {beta}108.12(1), Z=2, Fedorovgr. P2/sub 1//c. Centrosymmetric decavanadate isopolyanions (IPA), cesiumcations and water molecules are structural units of the crystal. EachIPA is bound with four neighbouring ones by hydrogen bonds between doublebridge atoms 0(1) and 0(2) (0...0 2.613A). Thus formed layers are boundby H-bonds with the participation of H/sub 2/O molecules (0...02.72-2.79A) and cesium cations. The fact of IPA protonation via {mu}/sub 2/-bridgeatom 0(1) (formation of OH-group) is confirmed by the elongation of V-O(1) bonds (up to 1.970A in the average) as compared with similar V-O(2)bonds (average length 1.850 A).</TEXT></DOC>
