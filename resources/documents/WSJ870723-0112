OttenStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/23/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><DATELINE> ATLANTA  </DATELINE><TEXT>   &quot;How you doing, Ricky?&quot; James Cunningham asks the slight youth who answers the knock on the door of the alley tenement. &quot;Glad to find you home.&quot;    Ricky reports he starts work the next morning at a nearby machine shop. Mr. Cunningham, a 29-year-old &quot;surveillance officer&quot; in Georgia's Department of Corrections, says that's great, but to be sure to let him know the address and phone number, and also to remember to show up Sunday to join a work crew clearing trash off a suburban highway.    They chat briefly, and then the 6-foot-3-inch Mr. Cunningham takes off to visit the next of the 15 to 20 other people he'll &quot;just drop in on&quot; that evening: men and women convicted of robbery, burglary, habitual drunken driving, sale or possession of drugs, and assorted other felonies. Ricky, 19, was caught for a second time breaking into a car.    Georgia's Intensive Probation Supervision (IPS) system, an innovative and widely copied program, is an effort to hold down a swollen prison population by keeping more offenders in the community -- but using strict curfews, unscheduled visits, random drug and alcohol testing, and other rigorous surveillance to provide stern punishment and to minimize risk to the public. The key: two-person or three-person teams with caseloads small enough to provide this sort of round-the-clock oversight -- only 25 offenders for each two-person team and only 40 for three supervisors.    All across the U.S., get-tough attitudes toward crime have sent state prison populations soaring; three-fourths of the states are, or have been, under federal court orders to relieve prison crowding. At the same time, however, there's almost universal recognition of the failure of ordinary probation systems, where overburdened probation officers struggle with case loads of 125 or more, providing so little real control as almost to invite repeat offenses.    Intensive probation supervision, or IPS, for serious but generally nonviolent offenders who would otherwise go to prison is a compromise answer, and Georgia, the first state with a well-organized system, has succeeded in building a notable track record. The Georgia experience will be highlighted in a panel discussion Sunday at the annual meeting of the National Governors' Association.    So far, 84% of the offenders assigned to the IPS program -- mostly people convicted of property crimes or habitual drug or alcohol offenders -- have either successfully completed their sentences or are still under IPS; only 14% had their probation revoked for technical or new criminal violations, and less than 2% have managed to escape from supervision.    The recidivism record is particularly impressive. Tracked over 18 months, IPS offenders committed fewer subsequent crimes, and particularly fewer serious crimes, than comparable groups that had served prison time or were on regular probation. Only one IPS probationer was subsequently convicted of armed robbery and four of burglary, far below the serious repeat rate for the other groups.    &quot;It's supervision and control that can make probation work,&quot; says Mark Corrigan, head of the National Institute for Sentencing Alternatives at Brandeis University. &quot;Simply stated, this is a safe, tough, affordable way to keep people out of prison.&quot;    But many experts caution other states to avoid unrealistic expectations about what IPS might do for them. &quot;Everything Georgia is doing is fine for Georgia, but it may not work as well for everyone else,&quot; warns Joan Petersilia, a Rand Corp. criminal justice specialist. In Georgia, politically sensitive elected judges tend to hand out harsh sentences, sending to prison many felons who wouldn't remotely be considered for prison in many other states. Thus, Ms. Petersilia says, the Georgia program &quot;may be dealing with offenders whose risk is unusually low by national standards,&quot; and states lacking a similar low-risk pool to tap for IPS may not have nearly as good results.    Georgia's IPS was inaugurated with an almost textbook campaign to sell the concept to judges, state legislators, local law-enforcement officials, the press and the public.    &quot;The way the prison population was piling up, we knew we couldn't build ourselves out of the problem,&quot; says deputy corrections commissioner Vince Fallin. &quot;We had to look at who was coming to prison and see what else we could do with them.&quot; A sampling indicated that judges would be willing to divert from prison many nonviolent offenders providing there was assurance that these men and women would really be restricted and closely watched.    Using money collected from special fees levied on probationers' earnings, Georgia set up two-person teams -- an experienced probation officer for counseling and court liaison and a surveillance officer, usually a former police officer or prison guard, to provide close monitoring. Later, some three-person teams were instituted, with one probation officer and two surveillance officers.    IPS probationers must spend at least six months under intensive supervision; after that, if proven reliable, they can be switched to regular probation for the balance of their sentences. All IPS probationers must work or attend school -- most work -- and in addition to the probation fees of $10 to $50 a month, many also must gradually pay off stiff fines and/or restitution to their victims. Each is also required to perform 132 hours of unpaid community service, working at maintenance and other jobs in hospitals, parks, day-care centers and charity programs.    All are under dusk-to-dawn and weekend curfews, and IPS officers make almost daily face-to-face contact to make sure the offenders are turning up for work, observing curfew hours, and going to whatever drug, alcohol or other treatment programs they've been ordered to attend. Checking is done irregularly, at odd hours of day and night. The probationers are also given frequent unscheduled drug and alcohol tests.    Through last December, 3,375 people had gone through the program -- admittedly only a dent in the 17,000 offenders in prison and the 98,000 on regular probation but, as officials frequently note, a number that would have required construction of two moderate-sized prisons. About 1,400 Georgians are currently in the IPS program.    Thus far, officials claim, IPS has proven a bargain. They figure it costs the state about $6,775 less a year on the average to keep a person under IPS than in prison, not even counting what might otherwise been spent on building new prisons. Moreover, the probation fees more than cover all IPS costs.    Though a few IPS probationers seem to resent the constant surveillance, most appear delighted to stay out of prison and be able to live with family or friends. &quot;I can't go out on the streets so maybe I'll save some money now,&quot; says Ricky. And Darlene, a 24-year-old former drug addict under a long sentence for cocaine possession, says: &quot;It lets you be with your family, it lets you earn money, and it keeps you away from places you shouldn't be. I guess those are three good things.&quot;    ---             Georgia's Intensive Probation Supervision               3,375 cases handled 1982 through 1986:                              Cases         Percentage  Race    White                     2,233            66.2%    Black                     1,139            33.8    Other                         3             0.0  Sex    Male                      2,973            88.1%    Female                      402            11.9  Crime    Violent personal            339            10.0%    Nonviolent personal          45             1.3    Property                  1,358            40.2    Drug possession             208             6.2    Drug sales                  581            17.2    Alcohol-related             695            20.6    Other                       149             4.4  Source: Georgia Department of Corrections</TEXT></DOC>
