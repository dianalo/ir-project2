Adams, Assistant ChiefCounsel, Bureau of the Public Debt, Parkersburg, West Virginia 26106-1328,(304) 420-6505.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> The Department of the Treasury hasan ongoing nationwide campaign to inform the public about the convenienceand safety of direct deposit, a Federal government program to have payeesauthorize the deposit of payments automatically into an account at a financialinstitution. In furtherance of the Department's goals to maximize the useof this electronic payment mechanism, the Bureau of the Public Debt haspromulgated separately regulations that will govern all Bureau paymentsmade by the ACH method. Interest on Series HH savings bonds issued on andafter October 1, 1989, will be paid by the ACH method to the owner or coowner'saccount at a financial institution, unless it is determined that extraordinarycircumstances warrant payment by check or other means. Upon an owner orcoowner's request, interest on Series H bonds, as well as Series HH bondsissued prior to October 1, 1989, will be paid by the ACH method. Financial institutions benefit from ACH payments through reduced operatingcosts associated with processing Series HH/H check payments and througha decrease in lobby congestion. Bondowners benefit by not having to worryabout lost, stolen, or delayed interest checks and are assured that theirmoney is on deposit and available for use on the payment date; they alsosave the time and expense of special trips to deposit checks. Finally,the Bureau is able to make use of technological improvements in makingSeries HH/H interest payments electronically and benefits from a reductionin paperwork resulting from handling claims for missing checks and respondingto inquiries concerning late check payments. The Series H offering (Department of the Treasury Circular No. 905), theregulations governing Series E and H bonds (Circular No. 530), the SeriesHH offering (Department of the Treasury Circular, Public Debt Series No.2-80), and the regulations governing Series EE and HH bonds (Departmentof the Treasury Circular, Public Debt Series No. 3-80) provide that semiannualinterest payments will be made only by check. The provisions of the aboveoffering circulars have been amended to accommodate payment of interestby the ACH method in the case of Series H and HH bonds issued prior toOctober 1, 1989, upon the owner or coowner's request, and to require paymentof interest by the ACH method in the case of Series HH bonds issued onor after October 1, 1989. Rules governing payments made by the Bureau ofthe Public Debt by the ACH method are contained in the recently issued31 CFR Part 370. It should be noted that under certain circumstances, interest paymentsmade on a bond by ACH will be directed to an account for the owner heldin names different from the registration on the security. As the paymentin such case will be made pursuant to the owner's request, it will be deemeda payment made pursuant to the regulations and constitute a discharge ofthe Department's obligation thereunder. Such interest payment will haveno effect on the legal ownership of the bond itself. That ownership isgoverned by the registration on the security. However, to better safeguardthe rights of survivorship, where they exist, the registration on the bondand the designation on the deposit account should preferably be identical.ACH payments for Series H and HH bonds bearing issue dates prior to October1, 1989, whether previously or hereafter authorized, will be made pursuantto 31 CFR Part 370. While Form 1199-A, an ACH authorization form issuedby the Financial Management Service, will be used, for the time being,to request or to make changes to ACH payments for such bonds, this usewill not connote applicability of the regulations prescribed in 31 CFRPart 210 to the Series H/HH interest payments. The second revision of Circular No.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">2-80 provided that only the proceeds of Series H bonds purchased forcash that reach final maturity may be reinvested in Series HH bonds. SeriesH bonds were first issued in exchange for other securities in January 1960and will reach the end of their second extended maturity period, beginningin January 1990. As these bonds will not be granted an additional extension,they will reach final maturity 30 years from their issue dates. Becauseit would not be appropriate to deprive owners of these bonds the opportunityto reinvest them in Series HH bonds so as to continue to receive currentincome, the reinvestment provisions have been expanded to include all maturedSeries H bonds, whether purchased for cash or issued in exchange for othersecurities. The increment appearing in the legends on Series H bonds issuedon a tax-deferral basis that have reached final maturity must be reportedfor Federal income tax purposes for the year of final maturity.<ITAG tagnum="84">Circular No. 2-80 </ITAG>Apart from the changes already mentioned, the Third Revision of CircularNo. 2-80 does not differ substantially from the Second Revision. Whereappropriate, there has been rewording for clarity and consistency. Differencesbetween the two revisions are discussed below. 1. Language has been incorporated in andSection; 352.0 to clarify that onlyeligible Series E and EE bonds and United States Savings Notes (FreedomShares) may be exchanged for Series HH bonds. 2. Paragraphs (a) and (d) of andSection; 352.2 have been revised to deleteprovisions pertaining to Series HH bonds purchased for cash under priorrevisions of this Circular; the cash offering was terminated on October31, 1982. 3. Paragraph (c) of andSection; 352.2 has been amended to reflect the 10year extended maturity period which has been authorized for all SeriesHH bonds. The bonds will now reach final maturity 20 years from their issuedates. 4. Paragraph (e) of andSection; 352.2 has been amended to delete provisionspertaining to the cash offering of Series HH bonds and to establish theinvestment yields for original and extended maturity periods. 5. Paragraph (f) of andSection; 352.2 has been rewritten to require paymentof interest by the ACH method for bonds issued on or after October 1, l989,and to permit such electronic payment of interest for bonds issued priorto that date upon request. 6. Paragraph (g) of andSection; 352.2 has been added to include referencesto Circular No. 3-80, which contains rules governing the submission ofdeposit account information for ACH payments and to the regulations governingpayments made by the ACH method by the Bureau of the Public Debt set outin 3l CFR Part 370. 7. Paragraph (h) of andSection; 352.2 was formerly paragraph (g). 8. References to the purchase amount limitation for Series HH bonds purchasedunder the now-terminated cash offering have been eliminated from andSection;352.4; Series HH bonds issued on exchange or reinvestment are not subjectto a purchase limitation. 9. Paragraph (a) of andSection; 352.7 has been revised to clarify the lengthof time during which Series E bonds and savings notes that have reachedfinal maturity may be exchanged for Series HH bonds. Paragraph (d) hasbeen rewritten for clarity. Language with respect to the tax consequencesof certain reissue transactions, formerly contained in paragraph (f), hasbeen incorporated into subparagraph (g)(1), which deals with the tax deferralprivilege. Subparagraph (g)(3) has been rewritten to incorporate interestincome reporting requirements imposed by IRS regulations. The rules governingnon-tax-deferred exchanges in paragraph (h) have been clarified. 10. The rules in andSection; 352.8 permitting reinvestment of the proceedsof matured Series H bonds in Series HH bonds have been expanded to includeSeries H bonds issued in exchange for other securities, as well as thosepurchased for cash. <ITAG tagnum="84">Circular No. 3-80 </ITAG>Section 353.31 of the regulations governing Series EE and HH savings bonds,as contained in Circular No. 3-80, has been revised throughout to eliminatereferences to payment of Series HH interest by check alone; where appropriate,there has been rewording for clarity and consistency. Substantive changesare discussed below. 1. References to the offering of Series HH bonds for cash, have been eliminatedbecause that practice was terminated effective October 1, 1982. 2. Former Paragraph (c) has been redesignated paragraph (b) and amendedto incorporate provisions mandating payment of interest by the ACH methodfor bonds issued on or after October 1, 1989, and to permit electronicpayment of interest on bonds issued prior to that date upon request. 3. Former Paragraph (f) has been redesignated (e) and rewritten to deletereference to the regulations governing Federal government checks, becauseinterest payments are now paid Federal government checks, because interestpayments are now paid by fiscal agency checks, rather than by Treasurychecks. 4. Paragraph (i) has been redesignated paragraph (h) and revised to containnew provisions for submission of deposit account information and paymentof interest by the ACH method. 5. Paragraph (j) has been redesignated paragraph (i) and expanded to covernonreceipt of ACH payments. <ITAG tagnum="84">Circular No. 905 </ITAG>Paragraph (e) of Section 332.2 of the Series H offering, as contained inCircular No. 905, has been revised to permit payment of interest by theACH method upon request. <ITAG tagnum="84">Circular No. 530 </ITAG>Revisions made to andSection; 315.31 of the regulations governing SeriesE and H savings bonds as contained in Circular No. 530, parallel the revisionsto andSection; 353.31 of Circular No. 3-80, as discussed above. <ITAG tagnum="84">Procedural Requirements </ITAG>Because this final rule relates to public contracts, the notice and publiccomment and delayed effective date provisions of the Administrative ProcedureAct are inapplicable pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 (a)(2).
