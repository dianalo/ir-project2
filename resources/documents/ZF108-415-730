 So, as MISmanagers make this critical purchasing decision, they must search for theappropriate intersection of capabilities and price.andM;Electronic mail and EDI are two prime forces in the evolution of officeautomation at Rockwell-International in Seal Beach, Calif.andM;&quot;We need to be able to talk to other communities, both inside and outside thecompany,&quot; said Janie Walker, Rockwell manager of office automation andtechnology.andP;  &quot;It is challenging because each business within Rockwell is itsown profit center and has complete autonomy.andP;  The environment is extremelyheterogeneous.&quot;andM;In 1986, Rockwell installed a Soft Switch gateway from Soft Switch of Wayne,Pa., to link DEC's VMS Mail and All-in-1 with IBM's Profs, as well as to mailsystems from Data General, Wang and 3Com.andM;The system ties together 58 nodes and 16,000 users.andP;  The Soft Switch softwarecost $200,000 plus $20,000 per year for maintenance.andP;  Training for operationsmanagers came to about $3,000.andM;Walker said Soft Switch has helped Rockwell conduct business moreeffectively.andM;&quot;Managers from different departments can work together to produce bids morequickly and efficiently.andP;  And by pulling all of the groups using E-mailsystems into a common billing arrangement, we were able to get a 40 percentdiscount from Western Union and MCI Mail,&quot; she explained.andM;Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is another tool at Rockwell.andP;  Implementedin 1987 by Rockwell's Information System Center (ISC) to offer a centralizedEDI transmission system for the entire company, it is now used by purchasinggroups in several business units.andM;According to Judy Gray, Rockwell systems consultant, Rockwell's ISC spentabout $25,000 for EDI transmission software from Transettlements of Atlanta.andO;&quot;It took about three months to implement,&quot; Gray said.andP;  &quot;This included outtingit on our mainframe, connecting communications and transmission software,developing applications and working with a business unit to connect it toEDI.&quot;andM;EDI use has been extended from one to six business units and includes 40suppliers and two customers.andP;  It is now used largely for purchase orders andrequests for quotes (RFQs).andP;  The procurement office builds an RFQ on thesystem, then instead of printing it, sends it via EDI.andP;  It is input asstandard ASCII, then translated into the RFQ system and printed.andP;  Ifnecessary, users on the network can transfer data from the mainframe to beprocessed on their VAX.andM;Although the ISC has yet to quantify EDI's benefits, Gray pointed out thereductions in paper and staff time needed for data input.andP;  &quot;Decisions can bemade more quickly and employees can now be freed up to perform other tasks,&quot;she explained.andM;&quot;We'd like to put the entire company on EDI, but that's up to each businessunit,&quot; Gray said.andP;  &quot;Top management support, once they understand the benefitsof EDI, will help,&quot; she added.andM;CALLING OAandM;Office automation grew from the bottom up at Contoocook, N.H.-based MerrimackCounty Telephone, a 45-employee organization providing telephone and cable TVservice to 10 towns in central New Hampshire.andM;&quot;We first acquired All-in-1 in 1985 for free as part of our efforts tofield-test an accounting package for DEC,&quot; said David Hatfield, MIS manager.andO;&quot;The four users in the accounting office liked it so much, we purchased itfor the entire company.&quot;andM;That mid-1980s purchase cost the company $11,000 for an All-in-1 license forits VAX 11/750.andP;  Today, the utility pays $312 per month for software support,telephone hotline services and new All-in-1 releases to run on its VAX 8250.andO;This VAX is part of a VAXcluster that also has a MicroVAX 3100 and twoVAXstation 2000s linked to VT220 and VT320 terminals.andM;Hatfield says the benefits have been considerable.andM;&quot;The primary advantage is the consistent user interface,&quot; Hatfield said.andO;&quot;The screens and applications use the same keystrokes to do similar functionsand all are integrated tightly enough so that using E-mail is similar tousing WPS Plus.andP;  This minimizes training and assistance for users.&quot;andM;Hatfiled has also customized All-in-1 to help the company run its businessaccording to its unique needs.andP;  That customization &quot;allows us to runnon-All-in-1-specific applications from the common menu,&quot; he said.andM;Hatfield purchased PowerHouse, a 4GL available from Cognos in Ottawa forabout $23,500 for the company's VAX 11/750.andP;  He subsequently paid $32,000 tolicense his VAX 8250 and MicroVAX installation.andM;Using PowerHouse, Hatfield built the company's communications applications,each of which can be accessed through the All-in-1 menu.andP;  These includecustomer information screens that show billing and maintenance information.andO;The benefits to both the telephone and cable TV portions of the business havebeen tangible.andM;&quot;We are able to provide fast, efficient customer service,&quot; Hatfield said.andO;&quot;On the telephone end, we can arrange immediate cancellation of calling cardprivileges in the case of an emergency like a lost card.andP;  Before it wouldhave taken a few days.&quot;andM;Merrimack's cable TV customers benefit as well.andP;  &quot;Every converter in thehomes of our subscribers is linked to our computer,&quot; Hatfield said.andP;  &quot;Withthe All-in-1 interface, our service reps can have immediate access to theconverter while speaking with a customer.andP;  This means changes can be madeimmediately, so if a customer wants to convert from HBO to Showtime, it canbe done in less than five minutes.andM;&quot;And it's so easy for us to do that we don't charge for this service, whichpromotes good will with our customers,&quot; he said, adding that this capabilityalso gives the company a competitive edge, as many other cable TV servicescharge a minimum of $10 to change customer service.andM;&quot;ISDN is definitely in our future, but exactly when will depend on ourrelationship with New England Telephone,&quot; Hatfield said.andP;  &quot;In the meantime,we're looking at All-in-1 Phase II and getting a workstation license to useit as a client processor connected to our local area VAXcluster server.&quot;andM;POWERING UPandM;Centerior Energy, an electric utility with headquarters in Independence,Ohio, has been building on its All-in-1 platform since the initial purchasein 1986 by a word processing group in one of the nine plants Centerioroperates.andP;  Since then, the $2.3 billion, 9,000-employee utility has adoptedAll-in-1 companywide.andM;&quot;We have a lot of VAXes and we needed word processing and electronic mailcapabilities that would give us standard communications among all of ouremployees,&quot; said Bill Hansen, senior systems analyst at Centerior.andM;&quot;We initially used All-in-1's WPS word processing software to producestandard monthly reports, which were distributed to users via E-mail,&quot; Hansensaid.andP;  &quot;Since then, each site has adopted WPS Plus and customized All-in-1 tomeet its own needs.&quot;andM;The applications are as diverse as the utility's users and the people withwhom they communicate.andP;  One plant uses the standard All-in-1 bulletin boardfeature to produce a daily licensee event report.andP;  This report lists anysignificant occurrences related to safety, such as a rise in temperature ofthe lake water used to cool the utility's nuclear reactors.andP;  The sameinformation is then used to prepare a report for the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission.andM;Several sites are using the Basis/All-in-1 interface, a text informationmanagement system available from Information Dimensions of Dublin, Ohio.andM;&quot;Basis extended All-in-1's capabilities to a great degree,&quot; Hansen said.andP;  &quot;Wefirst tried it to help manage updates to an ongoing report on changes made inour plants that impact safety.andP;  All-in-1 by itself didn't give us the abilityto search the 17-volume, 4,000-page document easily.andP;  Basis provided themeans for us to manage the document as a database, plus search capabilitiesthat helped us find words within the same sentences or paragraphs.&quot;andM;A six-month pilot program provided impressive feedback.andP;  &quot;Our cost/benefitsanalysis showed that we'd require one-fourth or a new VAX 6330 for $156,000plus 10 percent for maintenance, one and a half RA82 disk drives and acontroller for $50,000, and the Basis/All-in-1 interface at $23,000 forunlimited users on our cluster,&quot; Hansen said.andM;&quot;In total, we spent about $230,000 for equipment and estimated [personnelcosts at] $149,000 for one user, one systems analyst and aprogrammer/analyst,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;But personnel costs came in at less than$100,000.&quot;andM;Centerior projected that manpower and productivity savings would amount to$390,000 annually, plus $18,000 for year-end revisions.andP;  From this $408,000per year was subtracted $20,000, estimated for maintenance and for ananalyst's time.andP;  The total savings was $388,000 and the system paid foritself within the first year.andM;TEXT MANAGEMENT NEEDEDandM;&quot;We did have problems, but they were more organizational than technological.andO;We found we had no control over the integrity of the document because wehadn't set up a system to track the latest revisions,&quot; Hansen said.andM;&quot;We [needed] a way to control the text in the database so that only theapprovers in the licensing department could validate changes.andP;  This made ourword processing people happy, as previously there had been no way to managethis text,&quot; he said.andM;Centerior also found that text searches in its 20,000-page plant proceduresmanuals--which previously took two people about five days to perform--couldbe completed in 10 to 15 minutes with Basis/All-in-1.andP;  The company is alsousing Basis/All-in-1 for records management, chemical analysis, environmentalmonitoring and library management.andM;Centerior plans to begin using Basis/All-in-1 to maintain all of itsoperations and procedures manuals within the next two years.andP;  Using thedistributed capabilities of both All-in-1 and Basis, Hansen predicted thatthe company will need only one database engine on the network instead ofhaving to run the applications on each VAXcluster using them.andM;&quot;With every project, we have to continually be aware that the text is notlikely to be organizationally controlled, so we'll need to be vigilant,&quot;Hansen said.andM;&quot;Thinking about how to manage new office systems takes some time.andP;  It's awhole new paradigm,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
