Cubic, a high-technology concern, said it will supply tracking equipment for platforms in the North Sea, and land bases and computer equipment for the range's headquarters in Norfolk, England, and five other military facilities. The company said the privately owned facilities for the training range, situated between England and the Netherlands, will be leased to the U.S., Britain and the Netherlands. Range operations will be supervised by these three nations.    The company said work on the equipment is under way, with installation expected in early 1990. </TEXT></DOC>
