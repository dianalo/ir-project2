The Investor Responsibility Research Center's survey said theDemocrats _ Jesse Jackson, Michael Dukakis and Albert Gore _ differdramatically from Bush, the likely GOP nominee, on what U.S. policyshould be toward South Africa and the region.   The center is a public policy group that tracks issues andinvestment in South Africa, a country where blacks are deniedsocial and political rights through a system known as apartheid.   The country's racial segregation has attracted interest inUnited States, particularly among the black voters who have turnedout in force for Jackson.   Jackson's successes in the primaries ensure that the candidates'positions on South Africa, Mozambique and Angola will bescrutinized in 1988.   Jackson, who is black, has long stressed support for theoppressed in South Africa.   The survey, which was based on the candidates' statements and aquestionnaire, show that Vice President Bush for the most partendorses the policies the administration has pursued over the lastseven years.   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson, Bush's only rivalfor the GOP nomination, is the sole candidate seeking to repeal the1986 sanctions that Congress slapped on white-ruled South Africa.Robertson, however, has done poorly in the primaries and is notexpected to win the nomination.   In contrast to the Republicans, the Democrats want the UnitedStates to pursue a tougher line against South Africa.   Gore, a Tennessee senator who portrays himself a moderate, isless extreme than Jackson and Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor.The latter two agree on many points.   Here is a breakdown of the candidates' positions, according tothe survey.</TEXT><HEAD>Sanctions and Disinvestment</HEAD><TEXT>   Jackson and Dukakis want additional sanctions against Pretoriaif South Africa does not end its state of emergency, releasepolitical prisoners, remove the ban on the African NationalCongress _ the outlawed political organization based in Lusaka,Zambia _ and enter into negotiations to repeal the apartheid laws.   The two also have spoken in favor of U.S. companies pulling outof South Africa.   Gore is more equivocal about more sanctions, saying he wouldconsider them if South Africa shows ``no real and dramaticprogress.'' He said companies should make their own decisions ondisinvestment.   Bush would not recommend additional sanctions, but he wouldn'trepeal those put in place in 1986. The House is considering asanctions bill that amounts to a total embargo on South Africa.   Bush suggests the ``use of diplomacy and negotiations forconstructive change rather than impose additional sanctions.''</TEXT><HEAD>The African National Congress</HEAD><TEXT>   The Democrats pledge to have routine dialogue with the ANC. Theyalso say Pretoria should negotiate with the ANC and other groups.   Bush says he would continue the Reagan administration's periodicdiplomatic contacts with the ANC.</TEXT><HEAD>Angola</HEAD><TEXT>   Dukakis and Jackson want to stop U.S. aid to the anti-communistUNITA rebels headed by Jonas Savimbi, and, if elected, they wouldextend diplomatic recognition to the Soviet-backed Angolangovernment.   Gore says he is troubled with the aid to the rebels, but thatthey must be incorporated into a political settlement. He does notpromise to recognize the Angolan government.   Bush supports aid to the rebels as a way of blocking Sovietencroachment in Africa. He would not recognize Luanda in an effortto compel the Angolans to begin talks with UNITA and expel 40,000Cuban troops from the country.   Bush views the Cuban troops as the most important obstacle topeace in the region. Dukakis and Jackson say that a South Africanpullout from Namibia could lead to a Cuban withdrawal. South Africamaintains their troops in Namibia to protect the country from theCubans in Angola.</TEXT><HEAD>Mozambique</HEAD><TEXT>   Bush and the Democrats agree with the Reagan administration'spolicy of backing the Mozambique government instead of the Renamorebels, who are reportedly aided by South Africa.</TEXT><HEAD>Zimbabwe</HEAD><TEXT>   The Democrats favor restoration of economic aid to Zimbabwe. Aidwas cut off in mid-1986 after Zimbabwean officials insulted formerPresident Jimmy Carter at a Fourth of July party.</TEXT></DOC>
