Ihaven't detected anything that would indicate he's been bothered by it. He'sjust going to have to thump the first kick right through the uprights.&quot;; ...;TROJANS TAKE NOTICE OF PAWLAWSKI'S REMARKS; Cal quarterback Mike Pawlawski wastalking about the importance of not underestimating Southern Cal, but hisremarks were presumptuous enough to wind up on the Trojans' locker-room wall,anyway.;    &quot;They're a good team, a quality Pac-10 opponent,&quot; he said. &quot;Butit's not an undefeated team like Washington. We still need to understand theyare a good team. That's important. They're not 7-0, but they're a good teamfor us to play.&quot;; ...; BRONCOS CLOSING IN ON PASSING RECORDS; There are threegames remaining, but it's almost certain that this season's Santa Clarapassing offense will go down as the most prolific in school history.;    TheBroncos need 541 more passing yards to break the school record of 2,672 set in1985 with Greg Calcagno at quarterback. John St. Jacques needs 57 completionsto break Calcagno's '85 record of 197.;    Also likely to be erased is the '85record of 242.9 passing yards per game. The '91 average is 266.4.; STANFORDBAND NOT GOING TO OREGON; Stanford band manager Jesse Dorogusker said the bandwon't make the trip to Oregon with the football team for Saturday's game butthat the decision had little to do with the band's controversial performancein Eugene last year.;    &quot;Each year the athletic department pays for the bandto take one trip, so this year we went to USC,&quot; Dorogusker said.;    OffendedOregon administrators barred the band from future performances after itspoofed the state's environmental issues -- including the endangered spottedowl -- and lumber industry during last year's halftime routine. &quot;We weren'tplanning to go back -- even though we wouldn't be allowed back,&quot; Doroguskersaid.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Staff Writer Ric Bucher compiled this report.  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911101  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  461  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, November 1, 199100306242,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
