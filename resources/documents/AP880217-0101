(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson said today he hopes to getsupport from Bruce Babbitt if Babbitt drops out of the Democraticpresidential race as expected, while Paul Simon set the stage forhis withdrawal if he doesn't ``win somewhere'' next week.   Jackson, who finished fourth, said he and Babbitt discussed theformer Arizona governor's political future as voters were castingthe ballots that left Babbitt in sixth place Tuesday night.   ``He wanted to discuss what his options were, which he is stillwrestling with with his wife Hattie,'' Jackson said on ``CBS ThisMorning.'' ``He's not made a final judgment.''   Jackson quickly added, ``I hope I get his support.''   Simon, who finished third in the Democratic race behind MichaelDukakis and Richard Gephardt, said the balloting next week woulddetermine his political future.   ``I have to win either in South Dakota or Minnesota, and we haveto get additional campaign contributions,'' he said on NBC. ``Thosetwo things have to be there, otherwise, I'm going to have towithdraw. ... You have to win somewhere.''   After Iowa's caucuses last week, Alexander M. Haig Jr. withdrewfrom the Republican presidential race.   Babbitt, who also appeared on the CBS program, indicated todaythat he would like to continue his campaign, saying, ``I've devoteda year to talking to the American people.''   His wife, who joined him in the interview, added: ``I thinkwe'll keep going with the message of this campaign.''   Babbitt said Tuesday it was premature for Jackson and formerColorado Sen. Gary Hart to be wooing his backers, saying he wouldspend a few days in Washington and ``call and talk to my supportersall over the country and ask them this question: `How ... can wekeep this reform movement alive?'''   He had said prior to the New Hampshire primary that the state'svoters had the power of life and death over his candidacy.   Republican Rep. Jack Kemp of New York got 13 percent of the GOPvote and voiced optimism today over his third-place showing behindVice President George Bush and Dole.   ``We're going to do well in Minnesota,'' Kemp said on the ABCprogram.   The New York congressman added that ``people recognize we areviable, we are confident that we will be able to raise money.''   Pete du Pont, who got 10 percent of the GOP vote, found cause tocheer in that fourth-place showing just ahead of Pat Robertson inthe five-man Republican race.   ``Point is, we've all finished together,'' du Pont said of thetrio on the GOP's bottom rung. And on his prospects in the daysahead: ``We did much better in New Hampshire than we did in Iowa.We'll do much better in the South than we did in New Hampshire.''   Robertson, who finished with 9 percent, said the South would bea welcome change after Iowa, which was Dole's neighborhood, and NewHampshire, which was claimed by Bush: ``Tomorrow morning, I go intothe South, and they're going to be playing in my backyard.''   For the Democrats, though neither Jackson nor Gore got a NewEngland boost to take South, both were sure to find friendlierterritory in Dixie.   ``We've already been saving our resources for Super Tuesday,''said Gore in an interview from Houston on CBS. ``I've spent moretime here than other candidates.''   Both Hart and Jackson, who happened upon Babbitt at Cable NewsNetwork's studio in Manchester as the votes rolled in Tuesdaynight, huddled with the former Arizona governor to ask his supportshould he withdraw.   ``Our message has tremendous overlap. ... I hope that in time wewill work out some common ground in terms of our politics,'' saidJackson, who finished with 8 percent, ahead of Gore's 7 percent,Babbitt's 5 percent and Hart's 4 percent.   Hart said he expects to be a candidate ``as far ahead in thefuture as I can see.'' But he added, ``I understand that there arestandards that have to be met in terms of delegates and votes,'' hesaid. ``It will take at least 30 to 60 days to determine if I canput together a viable candidacy.''</TEXT></DOC>
