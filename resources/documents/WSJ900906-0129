Wallison's call for private deposit insurance isright on target in citing federal deposit insurance as theprimary source of the Sandamp;L debacle (editorial page, Aug. 16).The institutional arrangement he proposes to replace federalinsurance with, however -- while an improvement on thecurrent system -- is still a step removed from true marketdiscipline.   &quot;Negotiated contractual arrangements&quot; within the bankingsystem to monitor investment risk and, hence, adjustprivate-insurance premiums assume a level of knowledge on thepart of insurers that doesn't exist. The best way todetermine the &quot;risk&quot; in a portfolio is to look at its marketvalue, which is near impossible to do with cost accountingand thin-to-nonexistent secondary markets.</LP><TEXT>   Depositor discipline, which Mr. Wallison casuallydismisses, would solve this problem. He argues thatdepositors don't consider their money in financialinstitutions as &quot;investments.&quot; Well, if there were no federaldeposit insurance they'd start looking at those funds asinvestments quicker than you could say &quot;incentives matter.&quot;Perhaps they might take their funds out of Sandamp;Ls, causing theindustry to disappear. Since the industry itself is acreature of government, that wouldn't be all bad.   More likely, however, depositor discipline would be basedon a system in which Consumer Report-type organizations wouldprovide market valuations of the portfolios of theseinstitutions, thereby informing depositors of the true levelof capital available to protect deposits.   Under such a system financial institutions would becompelled to disclose the nature of their investments, andthey would end up having to mark to market their portfolios.This in turn would lead to broad secondary markets in theseinvestments, hence increasing the liquidity of theinstitutions and reducing the likelihood that &quot;runs&quot; couldshut down solvent banks. (That runs would shut down poorlymanaged banks should be viewed as a positive aspect ofdepositor discipline. The market works where governmentregulators don't.)   It is not at all clear that depositors in a true marketsystem would require insurance at all, federal or private.They don't in the case of money-market funds, which is whatSandamp;Ls probably would evolve into in any case.   Edward H. Crane   President   Cato Institute   Washington   ---   There currently is no private source of deposit insuranceavailable; we have looked in the past and even theprestigious and far-reaching Lloyd's has expressed nointerest. To create such a private structure would be amonumental task. Then it begs the question of who wouldregulate the insurer? What if the insurance industry, alreadyreeling from the impacts of high-yield bonds and fallingreal-estate values, fails? Who will bail it out? Are we notjust creating a future problem rather than a solution to thecurrent problem?   I shudder to think of what would happen to small banks ifsuch a private insurance case would happen. The privateinsurers would want to make the underwriting as efficient aspossible. It would be much easier to assess the risk of a fewinstitutions than many. The small banks would eventuallydisappear.   The idea of a self-insured pool is equally unappealing --and fallacious. Here Mr. Wallison falls prey to the illusionpresented by big numbers. He cites the 550 largest banks andthrifts with total capital accounts of $165 billion (I did ananalysis of the 258 largest banks and came up with equitycapital of $121 billion, which means that the thrifts don'tcontribute much). What Mr. Wallison doesn't say is that theseemingly huge capital available (by my analysis of March1990 data) is only 5.56% of equity, 7.52% primary capital(includes loan loss reserves) or 8.01% total capital(includes subordinated debt). Further, the risk capital ratiois only 8.10%.   The numbers become less important when one also considersthat the 258 largest banks also have 30% of their capital or2.29% of assets in nonperforming loans, only 1.89% of whichis reserved. A quick and dirty analysis takes the netavailable capital of those 258 banks from 5.56% to 5.16%. Theavailable capital is hardly a comfort -- only five cents ofevery dollar available for growth, exigencies and, for Mr.Wallison, systemic risk sharing. In contrast most small bankshave capital ratios of well over 8% and risk capital ofnearer to 15% -- even after the adjustment for asset quality.Being insured by Citicorp would do little to calm sleeplessnights.   Helge S. Christensen   President   Bankers' Bank of Wisconsin   Madison, Wis.   ---   Private insurance, be it banking syndicates or commercialinsurers, should insure deposits; however, the governmentshould remain as the insurer for, say, up to $25,000 indeposits per household.   Remember, the original intent of deposit insurance was toprotect the small depositor from ruin that came with a bankfailure. A combination of commercial insurance and governmentinsurance (for the small deposits) would allocate risksefficiently and at a much lower cost to the banking system.This would make U.S. banks more competitive and remove mostof the expensive bureaucracy and political favoritisminherent with the current method.
