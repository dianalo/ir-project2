Consumer spending rose a strong 1.1% in November from its October level, while personal income rose 0.3%, the Commerce Department said.    &quot;Many people had counted consumers out after their September car-buying binge,&quot; said Robert Ortner, the Commerce Department's chief economist. &quot;But they're coming back at a healthy pace.&quot;    &quot;The consumer keeps spending, defying the laws of economics,&quot; agreed David Fitton of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. &quot;We expected the Christmas season to be mediocre. It doesn't look that way anymore.&quot;    Consumer spending plunged a record 2.1% in October, fueling expectations that personal outlays would remain restrained. In particular, experts predicted that incentive programs for auto purchases in September would sap the consumers' buying zest.    That wisdom wasn't borne out in November. Spending was strong across all categories. Purchases of big-ticket durable goods were expected to be sizable because of the new tax law, which begins to phase out deductions for consumer interest next year. But spending for nondurable goods and services also showed increases.    Such hefty gains aren't expected to continue. &quot;Consumer spending clearly is decelerating,&quot; said Thomas Megan, an economist at Evans Economics in Washington. Added Mr. Ortner: &quot;For the next few months we might see spending increases of 0.4% or 0.5%, a moderate pace.&quot;    The rise in personal income in November followed increases of 0.4% in October and a 0.3% rise in September. The November increase was held down by two unusual factors: low farm subsidy payments and auto-worker bonuses in October, Mr. Ortner said.    Because spending rose more rapidly than income, the savings rate fell to 2.8% of after-tax income in November from 3.6% in the previous month.    Personal income in November ran at an annual rate of $3.531 trillion after rising in the previous month to an adjusted $3.52 trillion pace.    Wages and salaries last month rose 0.5% to a $2.113 trillion annual rate, after increasing 0.7% in the previous month to a $2.103 trillion pace.    The rise in spending put it at an adjusted $2.815 trillion annual rate, up from $2.785 trillion. The October decline was originally reported as 2%. The figures are adjusted for seasonal variations but not for inflation.    A consumption-based measure of price increases, which is reported after a onemonth lag, rose 0.2% in October, after increasing 0.5% in September.    Here is the Commerce Department's latest report on personal income. The figures are at seasonally adjusted annual rates in trillions of dollars.                                        Nov.
