After a year of raising interest rates to dampen inflationarypressures, Greenspan said, the Fed switched course in June and beganlowering rates because of widespread signs of a weakening economy.   Greenspan, making his midyear report to Congress, indicated thatthe Fed stood ready to lower rates further, but he said its bestefforts might not be enough to stave off an economic downturn.   ``Some day, some event will end the extraordinary string ofeconomic advances that has prevailed since late 1982,'' Greenspansaid in testimony before a House banking subcommittee.   The Fed chairman said it was entirely possible that some FederalReserve policy mistake could trigger a new recession despite theagency's best efforts to keep the current record peacetime recoverygoing.   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, the Bush administration praised theFed's efforts to drive down interest rates.   Michael Boskin, the president's chief economic adviser, told theJoint Economic Committee that the central bank had acted prudentlyand had avoided ``any major policy mistakes.''   He declined to say whether it should lower interest rates furtherto avoid a recession, saying, ``I don't like to preach to the Fed inpublic.''   ``The Federal Reserve is committed to doing its utmost to ensureprosperity and rising standards of living over the long run,''Greenspan said. ``We do, however, face a difficult balancing act.''   Greenspan said the Fed must weigh the dangers of a recessionagainst the risk that too loose a monetary policy could spark a newinflationary spiral in the country.   Greenspan said the Fed's policies would be oriented towardavoiding ``an unnecessary and destructive recession.''   The Fed chairman's comments indicated that the central bank waslikely to continue its policy of gradually lowering interest ratesover the coming months. Greenspan said the Fed first began easingcredit conditions in early June and eased again in early July.   Greenspan's remarks were the first official indication that thecentral bank had indeed reversed its year-long tightening efforts,although there was a widespread belief in financial markets thatthis was occurring.   Greenspan released a revised economic forecast which showed thatthe central bank still hopes to achieve a so-called soft landing inwhich growth will slow enough to cool inflationary pressures but notdecline so much that the country is thrown into a recession.   The Fed forecast that the overall economy would grow at an annualrate of between 2 percent and 2.5 percent. This was lower than theadministration's revised forecast on Tuesday that the economy wouldgrow at a 2.7 percent rate this year.   The Congressional Budget Office today forecast a 2.4 percent rateof growth this year, slowing to 2 percent in 1990.   The Fed saw more dangers from higher inflation, forecasting thatconsumer prices would rise by between 5 percent and 5.5 percent thisyear, up from last year's 4.4 percent increase.   The administration is less concerned about an uptick ininflation, forecasting that consumer prices would rise 4.9 percentthis year.   The CBO estimated consumer price inflation and interest rateswill be about half a percentage point higher both this year and in1989 than the administration forecast Tuesday.   It predicted civilian unemployment will rise from its current 5.3percent to average 5.5 percent in 1990.   ``The recent slowing in economic growth will not go so far as toturn into a recession during the next several months,'' CBO DirectorRobert Reischauer told the House Budget Committee.   Reischauer estimated the chances of the economy slipping into arecession during the next nine months was ``in the 15 percent to 40percent range.''   In setting preliminary monetary growth targets, Greenspan saidthe Fed had decided to leave the growth rates unchanged for thisyear and next year as well.   For M-2, the measure of the money supply which includes currencyin circulation and interest-bearing checking accounts, the Fed saidit would aim for an increase of between 3 percent and 7 percent boththis year and in 1990.   The central bank is charged with the primary task of guardingagainst inflation by controlling how fast the money supplyincreases. The goal is to supply enough money to support healthygrowth while making sure that inflation is not re-ignited by pumpingtoo much money into the system.   The Fed's actions influence the cost of money _ interest rates.   With the decision in early June to ease credit conditions, avariety of business and consumer interest rates have been fallingand economists are predicting that the current Fed easing coursewill mean further declines in banks' prime lending rate and inmortgage rates over the next several months.   Recent inflation figures look favorable. On Wednesday, thegovernment reported consumer prices edged up just 0.2 percent inJune, the smallest advance in 16 months. That followed news lastweek that prices at the wholesale level actually fell last month.   Before the June slowdown, consumer prices were shooting up at thefastest pace since 1982. But economists believe the worst is nowover for energy price increases, caused by the clampdown onproduction by oil exporting countries, and in food costs, which weredriven up by last summer's drought.</TEXT></DOC>
