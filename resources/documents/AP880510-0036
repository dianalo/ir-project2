The payments will range between 50 cents and $1 a day forthousands of Contra fighters _ ``enough to keep body and soultogether,'' according to the official, who spoke Monday on thecondition that he not be identified.   A final decision will be made later in the week by Alan Woods,administrator of the Agency for International Development, theofficial said.   After the Contras and Nicaragua's leftist government signed atemporary truce on March 23, Congress approved a $47.9 millionhumanitarian aid package for the rebels, consistent with aprovision in the truce agreement.   The legislation permits deliveries of food, clothing, shelterand medical supplies and medical care for children who are warvictims.   The agreement specified that the rebels receive the aid afterresettling in seven mutually agreed cease-fire zones.   However, no food or other supplies have been sent insideNicaragua because a dispute over ground rules within the zones hasprevented the resettlement from taking place.   This has left some Contra units with acute food shortages. Airdrops have been ruled out because of fear that Sandinista fightersmight shoot down the planes used to transport the food.   At the time of the truce, there were an estimated 12,000 Contrasinside Nicaragua but many have fled into Honduras in search of food.   The monthly cost of the payments is expected to be between$60,000 to $450,000, depending on availability of Contra couriersbased in Honduras to deliver the cash and the number of rebelsinside Nicaragua that can be reached at any given time. Most of thepayments will be in cordobas, Nicaragua's currency.   In addition, AID has earmarked more than $300,000 per month infamily assistance payments to rebels with technical skills. Part ofthe funds are being assigned to resistance personnel who work atContra offices in Miami.   Nicaraguan authorities maintain that any humanitarian assistancesent to the Contras without prior inspection by an officiallydesignated verification commission would be illegal under the truceagreement.   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has objected vigorously to aninterim program under which U.S.-sponsored aid is being sent bytruck or air drop from Tegucigalpa to Contra camps on the Honduranside of the border.   The bulk of this aid _ 262 metric tons _ has been sent by truck,the official said. The administration has denied Ortega's claimsthat the shipments have contained lethal equipment, insisting thatthe deliveries have received prior inspection from Honduran churchofficials.   The cease-fire began on April 1 and is schedued to last for 60days. During this period, the Sandinistas and the Contras are tonegotiate terms for a permanent cease-fire. But little progress hasbeen made in the talks.</TEXT></DOC>
