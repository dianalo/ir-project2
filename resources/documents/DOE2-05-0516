The analysis uses a similarity transformation that reduces theproblem to a one-dimensional boundary value problem. The deposition ofsilicon from silane is used as an example system. They present predictionsof deposition rate as a function of susceptor temperature, spin rate,and carrier gas.</TEXT></DOC>
