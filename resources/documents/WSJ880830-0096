It is our fate to do jihad.&quot;    But behind the tough talk, the Afghan guerrillas, known as the mujahedeen, know they have lost their best foreign friend in President Zia. He let three million Afghan refugees take shelter in Pakistan and he made Pakistan the chief covert-weapons pipeline to the mujahedeen. He paid a price: Pakistan was the object of more state-sponsored terrorist attacks last year than any other nation, and as the bomb blasts pummeled buses, bazaars and movie theaters, Pakistani public opinion turned sharply against President Zia.    &quot;If President Zia said the sky was blue, the people of Pakistan would say, no, it isn't blue,&quot; says Naim Majrooh, editor of an Afghan news bulletin in Peshawar. &quot;They also started having the same feeling about us.&quot;    Two big question marks remain for the Afghans. One is the future role of Gen. Hamid Gul, director of Pakistan's intelligence service, and one of the three Pakistanis who shaped Afghan policy while President Zia was alive. The other two policy makers died in the plane crash that took the president's life. They were President Zia himself and Akhtar Abdur Rahman, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.    No one can predict how Gen. Gul will fare on his own. So far, he has boosted Afghan morale by bringing resistance leaders to Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, for private talks and reassurance.    The other variable, Pakistan's civilian politicians, is dicier. Under Gen. Zia, the civilians hadn't any say on Afghan policy. To him, political parties were the &quot;instruments of Satan.&quot;    But an election is coming up in November. Without President Zia to direct the outcome, civilians who are elected may have a greater say on foreign policy.    Afghans don't trust the civilians, especially front-runner Benazir Bhutto and her Pakistan People's Party, or PPP. Ms. Bhutto has kept a moderate line on the Afghan issue, but PPP activists say the Afghans should go back to Afghanistan.    &quot;I think that if Benazir Bhutto comes to power, there will be a coalition between her government and the {Soviet-supported} government in Kabul,&quot; says Zia, a young Afghan living in Peshawar who isn't related to the late president.    For all the uncertainty, however, a few Afghans have found a silver lining in President Zia's death. They are the moderate Afghans, and while they aren't applauding their ally's death, they think the new Pakistan government may now pay greater heed to their moderate views.    Their hope reflects a long-standing division among Afghans about the course their country should take when the war ends. Some want a strict Islamic state, others want a broadly based government. The second group has complained for years that President Zia lavished foreign weapons and supplies on the Islamists. The moderates argue that if postwar Afghanistan is too Islamic, it will scare off the educated, Westernized elites who are best equipped to help rebuild their country.    &quot;We would like to have a liberal Afghanistan,&quot; says Hamed Karzai, a spokesman for the moderate Afghan National Liberation Front. &quot;But we are in an alien land and subjected to the wishes of the people whose guests we are.&quot; Mr. Karzai and others complain that the political divisions in Pakistan are affecting mujahedeen performance on the battlefield, at a time when the Soviet troops are leaving.    &quot;It's a key moment,&quot; says editor Majrooh. &quot;Our war has reached a stage where the mujahedeen have occupied the main territories of the country, but not the towns.&quot; Since the Soviet pullout began, the mujahedeen have taken cities, only to lose them days later. Western diplomats say Afghan government forces arrive within hours and attack with aerial bombs and artillery. Civilians die, and the population turns against the mujahedeen.    In the northern Afghan city of Qonduz, Afghan sources and Western diplomats say, Soviet bombers flew in straight from Central Asia when the mujahedeen arrived earlier this month. Scores died, and the Kabul regime later showed footage of the destruction on television, blaming it all on the resistance. Such incidents have sparked debate among the mujahedeen, some of whom still want to take cities.    &quot;It's stupid to take cities,&quot; argues Louis Dupree, an American authority on Afghanistan who works in Peshawar. &quot;The sensible thing to do is surround the cities and send in various people to work with the undergrounds that exist.&quot;    The basic problem is that the mujahedeen don't have an alternative government to offer. The political leaders in Peshawar can't reach consensus on the nature of a postwar government. But, says Mr. Dupree, &quot;You can't do it overnight. We want to have everybody in Afghanistan do in 20 years what we did in America in 200 years. It's ridiculous.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
