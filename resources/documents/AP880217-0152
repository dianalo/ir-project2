The Pentagon identified the victim as Lt. Col. William R.Higgins, chief of the 75-man observer group attached to the U.N.Interim Force in Lebanon. UNIFIL sources originally identified himas Lt. Col. Richard Higgins.   A Pentagon official said Higgins was on temporary detail servingas the chief of the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization's LebanonObserver Group. Higgins, 43, is a native of Danville, Ky., theofficial said.   U.N. sources said Higgins was kidnapped in the late afternoon onthe coastal highway between Lebanon's southernmost port of Tyre andthe border town of Naqoura, site of UNIFIL's headquarters.   No group claimed responsibility for the abduction, which bringsto 25 the number of foreigners missing and believed kidnapped inLebanon. One source said Higgins was returning from talks withShiite Moslem militia officials.   ``Higgins was driving in a U.N. Jeep station wagon from Tyre toNaqoura behind a similar vehicle in which two other observers weretraveling,'' UNIFIL spokesman Timur Goksel said.   He said the first vehicle went around a bend in the road, ``andwhen the two observers noticed that Higgins' car was not followingthem, they stopped and drove back, only to find Higgins' stationwagon abandoned,'' Goksel said.   Israel radio monitor Mickey Gurdus, who monitors radio stationsin Lebanon, said Higgins was kidnapped by three gunmen driving aMercedes car. Gurdus did not give the source of his information.   The gunmen stopped Higgins' vehicle, forced him to board theircar and speeded off toward the village of Shabrikha, Gurdus said onIsrael radio.   Goksel denied an earlier report that Higgins had an escort ofFijian troops from UNIFIL, and said the American officer was in hisstation wagon alone.   Goksel said UNIFIL helicopters and ground troops were seachingfor Higgins.   In Washington, a Defense Department official who spoke oncondition of anonymity confirmed that Higgins had been kidnappedand gave a similar account of the kidnapping.   He said 16 Americans are assigned to the observer group,although not all might be inside Lebanon at the same time. Goskelhad said there were six Americans assigned to the group.   Goksel said said members of the group do not carry weapons.   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said President Reagan wasinformed of the incident at his California ranch before he left ona flight to Washington.   ``We are still investigating, trying to learn more about it,''Reagan said as he boarded Air Force One.   Higgins was returning from a meeting in Tyre with Abdel MajidSaleh, a political leader of the mainstream Amal Shiite Moslemmilitia, a UNIFIL official told the The Associated Press inJerusalem. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidthe meeting took place in a friendly atmosphere.   The UNIFIL command declined to answer questions about theabduction. But one U.N. source in Naqoura said the area of theabduction is close to the Shiite Moslem villages of Ras el-Ein andDeir Qanoun.   The two villages are controlled by Justice Minister NabihBerri's Amal militia. But the influence of extremist Shiitefactions loyal to Iran has been steadily growing in both villages,Tyre-based reporters said.   UNIFIL was set up in 1978 on a mission to restore peace andsecurity and assist the Lebanese government in ensuring the returnof its effective authority in southern Lebanon.   In June 1982, after Israel's invasion of Lebanon, UNIFIL alsowas given the interim task of extending protection and humanitarianassistance to the people in the area.   UNTSO was organized to observe and maintain the cease-fireordered by the U.N. Security Council in July 1948 and supervise thegeneral armistice agreements between Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Lebanonand Israel, the Pentagon said. It serves as the focal point for allUnited Nations Middle East peacekeeping operations and monitorscease-fire violations on the border.   Higgins is married to Marine Maj. Robin Higgins, who works atthe Pentagon. She declined comment. He has a 17-year-old daughterby a previous marriage.   Twenty-four other foreigners, including eight Americans, aremissing and believed kidnapped in Lebanon.   The longest held hostage is Terry Anderson, 40, chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press. Anderson was seized inwest Beirut March 16, 1985.   Two Scandinavians were kidnapped Feb. 5 as they were drivingjust outside the southern port of Sidon.   Jan Stening of Sweden and William Jorgensen of Norway worked forthe U.N. Relief and Works Agency. No group claimed responsiblityfor their abduction, but U.N. officials said their abductors werePalestinians acting without a political motive.</TEXT></DOC>
