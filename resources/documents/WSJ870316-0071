Within minutes, carpenters were throwing up wooden barriers and chain link fences, dividing the building in half.    The assault was staged by Cineplex Odeon Corp. on a theater complex operated by rival Famous Players Ltd. Cineplex had signed a lease on half the building just two days before. When its carpenters were done, Famous Players could reach its theaters only through two fire exits. The complex has been closed ever since.    &quot;What Cineplex did was unconscionable, irresponsible and unfair,&quot; complains George Destounis, who retired recently as the president of Famous Players. &quot;Obviously, it was very effective,&quot; counters Garth Drabinsky, the chairman, president and chief executive of Toronto-based Cineplex.    Playing hardball is nothing new for Mr. Drabinsky, an abrasive 38-year-old entertainment lawyer with an unswerving passion for the silver screen. While Mr. Drabinsky still keeps moviegoers out of the Imperial Six, he is packing them in at his 1,500-screen circuit, North America's largest.    &quot;Garth has become perhaps the major force in exhibition today,&quot; says Jean Firstenberg, the director of the American Film Institute in Los Angeles. &quot;He's turning exhibition on its ear.&quot;    Specifically, Mr. Drabinsky is spending millions of dollars on a gamble that Americans can be lured from their videocassette players by art-deco movie houses where there's real butter on the popcorn and there's cappuccino in the cafes. To raise cash for his ambitious expansion plans, he has also done some once-unthinkable things: He sold a stake in his company to a Hollywood studio, and he has sold advertising time for commercials shown before feature films.    &quot;We are determined to heighten the moviegoing experience to a level unheard of since the advent of television,&quot; declares Mr. Drabinsky, who has built Cineplex into an industry trend-setter in the five years since he took the company public.    Mr. Drabinsky's newest theaters boast lobbies with Italian marble, original murals on pastel walls, plush carpets, scientifically contoured seats, space-age sound and projection, and lots of neon. His $12 million, 18-screen complex at Universal City, Calif., scheduled to open this summer, will have 6,000 seats, a 50-foot-high atrium lobby and two Parisian cafes. &quot;Every aspect of the finished product reflects Garth's personal taste,&quot; says an employee. A staff of 70 Cineplex architects and engineers does nothing but build and renovate theaters, often spending as much as $450,000 per screen.    Never one to mince words, Mr. Drabinsky says movie exhibition in North America has suffered over the last 25 years because &quot;the people who have run the industry, for the most part, have been more concerned with estate planning than reinvesting in the businesses that made them their fortunes.&quot; He contends that movie-theater owners must spend $500 million over the next three to four years to refurbish their theaters. &quot;There are parts of the U.S. where the theaters are in very significant disrepair,&quot; he says.    Jack Valenti, the president of the Motion Picture Association of America, agrees. &quot;Unless theater owners make their theaters fresh, clean and airy, and provide an epic viewing experience that can't be duplicated on a VCR, they're going to be out of business,&quot; he warns.    But Philip Garfinkle, senior vice president of the research firm of Entertainment Data Inc. in Beverly Hills, Calif., says the motion-picture-theater industry, with $5 billion a year in revenue, has already become a &quot;static business.&quot; Soaring rentals of videocassette movies, pay TV, satellite dishes and a dearth of hit movies held box-office revenue to a meager 0.8% gain last year, despite ticket-price increases, after a 7% decline in 1985. Moreover, theater admissions in 1986 were down for the second year in a row.    Nevertheless, theater owners are building more screens than ever. According to the National Association of Theatre Owners in New York, there were 19,571 indoor screens in the U.S. as of last August, a 6.8% rise from year-end 1985. &quot;Everybody wants to grab market share before there's a shakeout,&quot; explains one West Coast theater owner.    Although most exhibitors are following Mr. Drabinsky's example and improving theater decor, many bristle at his self-aggrandizement. &quot;The notion that he's some later-day messiah is misguided, self-serving and obnoxious,&quot; says Alan Friedberg, the president of Boston-based USA Cinemas Inc., a chain of 100 theaters. &quot;Drabinsky is not the only exhibitor moving into the modern age.&quot;    But Richard Fox, past president of the theater owners' group, admits that while &quot;Garth hasn't told us anything we didn't already know, he has taught us to do it better and quicker than we were. Garth is walking proof that it works.&quot;    Since spending $1.3 million to modernize the Fairfax Cinema in Los Angeles and reopening it last May, Cineplex has chalked up box-office revenue averaging $40,000 a week, up from $7,000 before the renovations.    Cineplex also won a certificate of merit last year from the Los Angeles Conservancy, a historic preservation society, for the restoration of its Showcase Cinema. And this summer, Montreal's World Film Festival plans to give Mr. Drabinsky a special award for &quot;his unique contributions to the rejuvenation of the moviegoing experience.&quot;    Mr. Drabinsky is also widely credited with igniting a stampede by movie studios to buy theater chains. Last year, he sold 50% of Cineplex to MCA Inc., a real-estate and entertainment concern that owns Universal City Studios. Since then, several other big studios have paid or agreed to pay nearly $1 billion to acquire theaters.    &quot;What Garth did will have profound long-term benefits for exhibition,&quot; says Mr. Fox. Studios, he says, can help their newly purchased movie houses by delaying the quick release of a film to the VCR market or to pay TV. &quot;We'll be a stronger industry because of it,&quot; he predicts.    Cineplex has used the $157 million in proceeds from its MCA marriage to grow stronger, too. It paid off debt from the acquisition of theater chains, strengthening its balance sheet for more expansion. Mr. Drabinsky plans to add 500 screens by 1990 as part of a $150 million capital-spending program that includes $22 million for theater renovations. Cineplex's Film House unit also prints films for MCA, and the two companies are jointly developing a huge film studio and theme park in Florida.    Mr. Drabinsky came painfully to his fascination with film. He contracted polio at age three and was confined to bed much of the time until he was 12. &quot;Because I didn't have a normal childhood, I compensated in creative and academic pursuits,&quot; he says. He became a student leader and champion debater and spent hours in movie houses.    In the early 1970s, Mr. Drabinsky published several film magazines and produced TV and stage shows. His law practice flourished, and his 1976 book, &quot;Motion Pictures and the Arts in Canada: The Business and the Law,&quot; is still a standard reference.    In 1979, Mr. Drabinsky and Nathan Taylor, a legendary Canadian exhibitor, opened Cineplex's first theater, an 18-screen complex in an underground parking garage here. The movie house grosses about $75,000 a week, more than any other theater in Canada, industry sources say. Mr. Drabinsky found the site while filming one of the six movies he produced between 1977 and 1983.    &quot;I can understand volume of space and what you can do with it a lot better than most of my competitors,&quot; Mr. Drabinsky boasts. &quot;That allows me to do things like build theaters on top of a bus garage {in Toronto} where nobody thought you could do that. . . . Or going up to the eighth floor of a shopping center in Los Angeles when every other exhibitor in America passed on the location.&quot;    Cineplex earned the equivalent of $23.7 million (or $31.6 million Canadian) last year, a 152% increase from 1985. Helen Murphy, an analyst with the Canadian unit of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., predicts net income this year will reach at least the equivalent of $41 million, on an 80% revenue gain to the equivalent of $560 million.    Yet Cineplex's original plan -- showing art and second-run films in 100-seat multiscreen complexes -- nearly ended in bankruptcy proceedings. Canada's two largest theater chains, Famous Players and Canadian Odeon Theatres Ltd., had almost exclusive access to movies from the big Hollywood studios. And as Cineplex grew, it got fewer popular second-run films. &quot;We were forced to go into the distribution business so we could have films to show,&quot; Mr. Taylor recalls.    In late 1982, with his debts rising and losses mounting, Mr. Drabinsky persuaded Canada's antitrust agency to investigate movie distribution. The agency announced its investigation only hours after Cineplex's bankers called their loans. The banks held off because of the probe, and Mr. Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb, Cineplex's vice chairman, put up about $3 million of their own money to keep the company afloat. In mid-1983, six U.S. studios signed a consent decree with the Canadian government, allowing all exhibitors to bid for films.    A year after the consent decree, which Mr. Drabinsky calls the &quot;high point of my life,&quot; he acquired Canadian Odeon, with financial backing from Seagram Co.'s Bronfman family. In 1985, Cineplex bought Plitt Theatres Inc., the fourth-largest U.S. circuit. And last year it acquired RKO Century Warner Theatres Inc., a New York circuit. Cineplex now has a 40% to 60% share in North America's four most important movie markets -- New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Toronto.    &quot;The irony is that had Famous Players and Odeon thrown the odd picture Garth's way, Cineplex probably wouldn't have reached the heights it has,&quot; says Daniel Weinzweig, the president of Norstar Releasing Inc., a Toronto film distributor and a former Cineplex vice president.    Now Mr. Drabinsky has so many screens that he can quickly move hits into large theaters and flops into small ones. He also closes some low-volume theaters he buys and builds new ones in better locations. Ms. Murphy of Prudential-Bache estimates that 43% of Cineplex's net income last year came from real-estate sales.    Despite a pronounced limp, Mr. Drabinsky personally tours every theater Cineplex acquires. He also makes surprise inspections, sometimes berating theater managers for having messy washrooms or lobbies.    Indeed, Mr. Drabinsky is known for his quick temper. &quot;He resents anything done against him or the company,&quot; says Cineplex's Mr. Taylor. A Toronto Star newspaper column critical of the cleanliness of his theaters and the advertisements that were being shown at the time so infuriated Mr. Drabinsky that he unsuccessfully sought an injunction to prevent distribution of the article. He currently is seeking $22 million in a libel suit he has filed against the newspaper.    He also has made other enemies along the way. Last year, he angered officials of Paragon Motion Pictures of Toronto by suggesting to MCA that it was paying too much to have Paragon produce 13 TV episodes of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents.&quot; &quot;This is an example of how people who do very well, very quickly change the way they behave,&quot; says John Slan, the president of Paragon. Mr. Drabinsky, whose only role in the transaction was to have Cineplex process the film, defends his actions. &quot;We are an extra pair of eyes for MCA here,&quot; he says.    But the way Art Murphy, a film analyst for the industry publication Variety, sees it, Mr. Drabinsky's strategy may be flawed. &quot;Cappuccino and carrot cake are cosmetic details that matter to some people but not to others,&quot; Mr. Murphy maintains. &quot;People will remember a clean theater, and that may be a factor in coming back. But in the end, what really matters is having a good film to see.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
