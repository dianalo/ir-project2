The court convicted the 68-year-old Demjanjuk of all four countsagainst him: war crimes, crimes against the Jewish people, crimesagainst humanity and crimes against persecuted people.   Demjanjuk was absent from the court as the guilty verdict wasread. He listened from an adjoining cell, where he lay on a cotsuffering from what his family said was a back injury.   He will be sentenced April 25 and could face the death penalty.Observers have said it was more likely he would receive a lifeprison term. Defense attorneys have said they would appeal.   Demjanjuk was the second person to be convicted of war crimes inIsrael. Adolf Eichmann, architect of Adolf Hitler's ``FinalSolution'' for the extermination of European Jewry, was convictedand hanged in 1962, the only person to have been executed inIsrael's 40-year history.   In their lengthy summation, the judges rejected key defensearguments and said Demjanjuk's testimony was ``filled withinconsistent versions.''   Earlier, Israel radio reported Demjanjuk stayed away fromtoday's court session because his attorney, Yoram Sheftel, told himhe thought he would be convicted.   Sheftel confirmed to The Associated Press that he told Demjanjukthree days ago ``there is no doubt in my mind he is going to beconvicted, even though he deserves an acquittal.''   Of Demjanjuk's inability to sit in the courtroom, Sheftel said:``I would not exclude the possibility that it was related tonerves.''   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk was charged with war crimes, crimesagainst the Jewish people and crimes against humanity for allegedlyoperating gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews at the Treblinkadeath camp in Nazi-occupied Poland in 1942 and 1943.   Levine indicated during his summation that the judges gave greatweight to the testimony of five survivors who identified Demjanjukas ``Ivan the Terrible.''   The question of identity has been key during the 14-month trial.Demjanjuk denies he is ``Ivan'' and defense attorneys questionedthe memory of survivors.   Levine said survivors' testimony had persuaded the court ``theseexperiences are deeply ingrained on their memories, the horrors area deep part of them, the sights are before their eyes and thestories are true and accurate.''   Polish-born Judge Zvi Tal also rejected a defense contentionthat ``Ivan'' was killed during a prisoner revolt in August 1943.   Inconsistences in Demjanjuk's testimony, Tal added, ``lead usnot to believe the version of the accused ... that he spent 18months (at a prisoner-of-war camp) is totally unsupportable andimplausible.''   Demjanjuk's wife, Vera, 62, was seen crying and wringing herhands during the lunch break. ``I can't even sit down,'' she said.   Demjanjuk, who lived in a Cleveland suburb before beingextradited to Israel in February 1986, claims he is a victim ofmistaken identity. He says he was a Nazi prisoner-of-war during theperiod in question.   The prosecution's case against Demjanjuk has rested largely onthe memories of the five Treblinka survivors.   A pivotal piece of prosecution evidence was Demjanjuk's allegedNazi identity card, provided to Israel by the Soviet Union.   The document, issued at Trawniki, a training camp for death campguards in Nazi-held Poland, does not mention Treblinka but statesthat Demjanjuk was posted at the nearby Sobibor death camp.   Six prosecution experts authenticated the card's paper, ink,photograph and signatures, and an equal number of defense witnessessaid the document was forged. Demjanjuk claims the Trawniki cardwas fabricated by the Soviets to punish him for fighting in ananti-communist unit organized by the Nazis at the end of World WarII.   Demjanjuk's attorneys presented 12 statements from Treblinkainmates who failed to identify Demjanjuk's picture as that of``Ivan.''   Besides Mrs. Demjanjuk, the defendant's son John Jr., 22;son-in-law Ed Nishnic; daughter Lydia Maday, 37; and her husbandAndrij went to Israel to hear the verdict. Another daughter, IreneNishnic, 27, and Demjanjuk's 2-year-old grandson, Eddie, remainedin Cleveland.</TEXT></DOC>
