On other markets, precious metals advanced; grains and soybeanswere mixed; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 24 cents lower to 3cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $18.30a barrel, the lowest near-month settlement since March 7. Heatingoil futures finished .07 cent to .17 cent higher with August at49.49 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .43 cent to .84 centlower with August at 51.34 cents a gallon.   Tuesday's weekly American Petroleum Institute report, whichshowed a 1.4-million-barrel drawdown in U.S. supplies of crude, wasinitially perceived as slightly supportive.   But analysts said closer examination of the report showed anincrease of more than 3 million barrels in the Gulf Coast region,an indication that demand for gasoline is not keeping pace withcrude-oil production.   The report also showed overall gasoline production running at arate of 7.3 million barrels a day.   ``That's a lot, especially given that demand seems to beslacking off a bit,'' said Jerry Samuels, an analyst in New Yorkwith Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.   The factors that contributed to a sharp rise in oil pricesearlier this year _ OPEC production cutbacks, tightening suppliesand labor tensions in the North Sea oilfields _ have faded or beenovershadowed by the downturn in gasoline demand, and traders areincreasingly prone to selling as the market moves lower.   Crude oil for September delivery traded as low as $18.27 onTuesday. Analysts said a drop below $18.25 would likely spark a newround of heavy selling.   Gold and silver futures advanced slightly on New York'sCommodity Exchange in reaction to a weaker dollar. Gold settled 90cents to $1.20 higher with August at $375 a troy ounce; silver was1.5 cents to 1.6 cents higher with September at $5.275 a troy ounce.   Wheat futures prices rose while corn and soybean futuresfinished narrowly mixed in quiet trading on the Chicago Board ofTrade.   Analysts attributed much of the buying to perceptions thatprices were exaggeratedly low after recent declines.   Selling in the corn and soybean pits was based largely on ideasthat recent rains in the Midwest had improved crop conditions.   Gerald Zusel, manager of exchange floor operations with BalfourMaclaine Corp., a futures brokerage firm, said that with more thanhalf the corn crop now past the sensitive pollination phase,traders had begun to shift their focus to the soybean crop, whichis nearing its critical flowering and pod-setting stage.   ``It'll be pretty difficult to damage the corn crop from here onin but weather can still be an important factor for the beans,''Zusel said.   Wheat settled 2 cents to 6 cents higher with September at $3.88\a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to } cent higher with September at$2.29{ a bushel; oats were unchanged to { cent lower with Septemberat $1.42} a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents lower to } cent higherwith August at $6.61} a bushel.   Pork belly futures made new life-of-contract lows across theboard on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, reflecting lower pricesfor fresh bellies, deteriorating demand and increased production.   Live cattle settled .15 cent lower to .40 cent higher withAugust at 72.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent lower to.30 cent higher with August at 83.52 cents a pound; live hogs were.18 cent lower to .15 cent higher with August at 45.92 cents apound; frozen pork bellies were .33 cent to .85 cent lower withAugust at 27.10 cents a pound.</TEXT></DOC>
