The officials are telling the U.S. and other partners thatsince a cabinet shakeup earlier this year, the attitude atthe top has changed. They also are making efforts to promotethat change of attitude with working-level officials whoactually decide whether foreign products and services getinto the country. &quot;It can't be done in a day. . . . but weare going in the right direction,&quot; said Kim Sam-Hoon,director general of the international trade bureau of theMinistry of Foreign Affairs.</LP><TEXT>   In what some have cynically called a &quot;charm offensive,&quot;officials are giving speeches, writing newspaper articles andgiving lunches promoting free trade. And it is having someeffect, analysts said.   The Seoul branch of the American Chamber of Commerce isvisiting Washington this week to tell lawmakers and tradeofficials about the change in Korea's attitude. RobertGregory, group president, said its depiction of Korean traderelations will be more upbeat than last year's.   Chamber members are carrying with them a 27-page reportthat details problems in Korea, such as lack of intellectualproperty protection, foreign companies' difficulties inmoving capital into the country, and rules that make it hardfor small Korean business to import.   This is a critical time for Korean trade, with the U.S.government reviewing trade policies in light of a domesticrecession and rising trade protectionism sentiment. Relationsbetween Korea and its Western trade partners were strainedlast year when Korean officials, concerned about slowingexports, tried to damp imports.   U.S. officials cite the case of imported pecans. Thoughthe nuts are legal to import, Korean officials blockedshipments claiming they carried codling moths. The U.S.provided scientific evidence that the pests don't live inpecans, but it took well over a year to resolve the dispute.   The American Chamber of Commerce recently noted, &quot;In orderto resolve this nonissue, which will result in total trade ofno more than a few million dollars, at least three U.S.senators, a number of congressmen, at least four U.S. cabinetsecretaries, numerous sub-cabinet officials and at least twoambassadors became involved.&quot;   But now there are solid signs of progress. For instance,U.S. and Korean officials meet at the end of every month toresolve minor trading issues, usually arising frommisunderstandings at Korean ports. &quot;We are dealing them asquickly, as quietly, and as locally as possible,&quot; said Mr.Kim of the Foreign Ministry.</TEXT></DOC>
