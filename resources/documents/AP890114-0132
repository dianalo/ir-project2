In a separate report, the official news agency said SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev called for major changes in the farmsector, but defended the current system of giant collective andstate farms.   In a report on a meeting Saturday of the Council of Ministers, orSoviet Cabinet, Tass said officials revealed some 1988 economicstatistics.   The national income, a measure of economic activity that differsfrom gross national product by excluding some indexes, including thevalue of some services, increased by 4.4 percent in 1988 and by 3.6percent for the period of 1986-1988, Tass said.   ``The growth of national income was assured by an increase inlabor productivity with a reduction in 1987-1988 of the number ofpeople engaged in material production,'' Tass said.   However, it said the national income still fell short of the planfor 1988 by 13.3 billion rubles, or $21 billion. It did not give theplanned figure.   The ministers sharply criticized the country's inability tosupply the population with enough fruit, vegetables and otherfoodstuffs.   ``No stability in the development of agricultural production andin the operation of processing branches had been achieved so far,''Tass reported. ``The population's requirements for many foodstuffsare not met, big purchases of food abroad have to be made.''   The cost of those purchases for the last three years was $48billion, it said.   Gorbachev said a long-awaited plenary meeting of the CommunistParty Central Committee on agriculture will take place in March.   The Soviet president is pushing to increase farmers' interest intheir work by organizing them on the basis of smaller groups andgiving them more responsibility and a chance to earn more money forharder work.   But in remarks Friday to agricultural specialists, Gorbachevdefended the giant collective and state farms that were organizedduring Stalinist times. The remarks were carried Saturday by Tass.   ``Those who do not trust the collective and state farms ... havesimply failed to think everything over to the end and failed to sortthings out,'' Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying.   ``It is precisely now that our big collective and state farmswill be able to work in the right way and in the interests of ruralworkers, and it means, for the benefit of the country because wereveal their potential in boosting the output of products.''</TEXT></DOC>
