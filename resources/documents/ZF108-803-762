Everywhere, entrepreneurs are emergingfrom the shells of state organizations ranging from companies and researchinstitutes to military training centers, agricultural co-ops and computerclubs.andP;  Communism did not totally destroy its victims' ingenuity, but it hasimposed a devastating tax of inefficiency and distortion of normal businessstructures.andP;  Small businesses are now permitted but they are still hamperedby constantly changing, frequently vague restrictions and by persistenthostility from the old guard.andP;  The countries we visited range widely, fromYugoslavia, with its heritage of locally controlled if state-owned firms, toCzechoslovakia, undergoing a breakdown of centralized state control thatdestroyed the country's position as one of Europe's leading industrialeconomies before the Second World War.andP;  We found a high level of technicalsophistication in Bulgaria but little commercial development, whileYugoslavia is economically advanced but probably least sophisticatedtechnically.andP;  Yugoslavials computer community seems to be devoted mostly toaccounting systems  - useful stuff but not likely to give it a competitiveadvantage on world markets.andP;  Poland suffers from a severe if restorativeeconomic crisis and indifference to intellectual property rights.andP;  Bycontrast, in Hungary we found small software firms growing vigorously in theshadow of state-owned SZKI, Szamalk and Sztaki (see Release 1.0, 90-5), allof which are also trying to figure out how to devolve into clusters ofsmaller, privately owned firms.andP;  All over, ownership rights are unclear, tosay nothing of the transition from state to private ownership.andP;  Who gets thespoils? The workers who built the thing from scratch? The two or three peoplewho directed the effort? Some giant government combine that tolerated theirsemi-independence? The state (not the Party!) coffers? Some giant foreignbank or other investor? And what's the price? Employees are now trying toundervalue what they have created so they can afford to buy it, while theputative owners want a sizable reward for letting go.andP;  Being profitable isn'tnecessarily an advantage these days, because you'll get a better price fromthe state if your business is losing money.andP;  Meanwhile, accounting is a dicyproposition anyway, especially in the East, and you should read any numberswe cite with skepticism.andP;  On the technical front, interest in UNIX iswidespread, especially now that CoCom restrictions have lessened (see ournext issue).andP;  Precisely because of CoCom, there's a lot of ingenuity in usingsmaller systems to manage large, complex tasks.andP;  On the other hand, becauseof largely centralized government structures, there's little businessexperience with business, as opposed to computer, downsizing.andP;  Interest inthe Mac, newly freed of CoCom restrictions, is about to be satisfied: Applehas just signed up distributors in Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and is openingoffices in Poland and the USSR.andP;  There are little more than a thousand Macsin the East all told, we estimate.andM;A world shaped by bureaucraciesandM;Although pcs are the hot thing in Central Europe as they are in the rest ofthe world, this does not mean that there are no mainframes.andP;  on the contrary,in these tightly controlled markets of giant state enterprises and stuntedentrepreneurship, until recently much of the computer power has been in largesystems, IBM or ICL or Unisys or NCR mainframes or copies thereof.andP;  Mosttechnology in the former East Bloc is ten or more years old, which means thatofficialdom is just discovering minis and workstations.andP;  This market vacuumrepresents an opportunity for Compaq, NetFrame, Sun and the like, offeringnetworking and UNIX, while IBM is stepping in rapidly with the AS/400.andO;Meanwhile, pcs have been first seeping and now flooding in through lessofficial channels.andP;  The difference here is that although everyone has heardof IBM and Apple, few people have one.andP;  The greatest share of the market byfar belongs to &quot;no-names&quot; - a word incorporated into languages from Russianand Bulgarian to Polish, Czech and Croatian.andP;  CoCom has certainly Westerncountries from shipping systems in, but it has not restricted CentralEuropeans and Soviets from buying from non-CoCom suppliers, mostly in the FarEast.andP;  (Shortage of money, however, kept volumes down; see the chart on page5.) With greater availability of imports and eased travel restrictions, pcprices are heading rapidly down toward world levels, making the market moreopen but more difficult for Compaq and IBM at the low end.andP;  Both IBM andCompaq face a far more cutthroat market in Central Europe than the one theygrew up with  and probably a harder time training dealers to offer the levelsof service and support that differentiate their products.andP;  Compaq is makingthe commitment to do so, but the IBM representatives we talked to seemed moreinterested in the mainframe and AS/400 business  - probably a sensibleattitude for the moment, given that there's demand for everything but IBM'srelative strengths are greater at the high end.andP;  (Some competition also comesfrom the secondhand market, even in mainframes.andP;  People offer to sell usedmainframes for almost nothing,&quot; says an IBM rep in Yugoslavia.andP;  It's aproblem; we don't want this place to become a museum.&quot; For example, onecompany we visited had bought a six-month-old mainframe from an airline athalf price.)andM;The dark side of freedomandM;Aside from the obvious problems of inadequate infrastructure and lack ofexperienced people, perhaps the toughest challenge faced by many of thesmaller companies is skepticism from their own people: Everyone wants to buyfrom the West, travel in the West, hire people with experience in the West.andO;You have to look hard to find Eastern products selling in the East, eventhough a number of vendors have been successful outside their home countries,including Novotrade, Compubrug, SZKI and Graphisoft of Hungary; SPandamp;S ofBulgaria; Zeto-Rodan of Poland; and (though inadvertently) the Soviet Academyof Sciences with Tetris.andP;  Autodesk has found several products from Parallelin Moscow and Software Slusovice in Czechoslovakia that it will be adding toits own line-up for sale in the West.andP;  But locally sold products are rare(page 21), although there are a few  - Ed3, a home-grown wp system from Terain Zagreb; Text602 from Software602 in Prague; Beta, Lexicon, Master andothers from ParaGraph in Moscow (see Release 1.0, 90-1 and 90-5); and QR DOSfrom SPandamp;S in Sofia.andP;  Moreover, these products don't get great marketing; mostads still look like vague spec sheets or the back pages of InfoWorld or PCWeek: what's available, where, and how much.andP;  (The actual level ofinformation is quite high, especially in the Soviet Union and in Hungary,where the local variants of IDG's  World&quot; publications are already doingwell.) And, for all the fascination with free markets, companies also missthe placid protected world of the past.andP;  Several that want to go private wantto keep government funding for &quot;research.&quot; Firms that were first into a newmarket don't always welcome competition from newer entrants  - particularlytheir own spin-offs.andP;  Meanwhile, governments may change, but the localbureaucracies are slower to.andP;  Poland's Zeto-Rodan (among others) complainsthat government personnel would much rather buy from, say, a French firm especially if they have to go to Paris for negotiations or training  - thanfrom a local firm, even at a huge cost differential.andP;  Nor is the opening-upof these markets always beneficial to outsiders in the short run.andP;  It meansmore competition and more confusion.andP;  It used to be easy; there were just oneor two central organizations to sell to and get paid by; now it's afree-for-all.andP;  Now vendors have to assess the qualifications and quality ofthe people clamoring to sell and support their products.andP;  There's no Softselor Micro D yet,&quot; says East Europe manager Bruce Marquart of Ashton-Tate.andO;There's the possibility of making mistakes where growth means success ...andO;but for the first time inefficiency or ineptitude may mean failure.andP;  Welcometo the free market!andO;</TEXT></DOC>
