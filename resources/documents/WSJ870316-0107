The marketer of electronic telecommunications devices said the move will result in a one-time charge for the fourth quarter and for the year. Company officials said they couldn't yet specify the amount of the charge, but said it &quot;is in the order of several million dollars.&quot; The division had a loss last year on sales of about $10 million, a spokesman said. The amount of the loss wasn't disclosed.    Howard A. Laffler, president, said he expects new entries into the hand-held cellular telephone market to further erode retail prices, making it difficult for Walker to &quot;profitably participate&quot; in the market.    For the nine months ended Sept. 30, the company earned $914,831, or 21 cents a share, on revenue of $30.4 million. </TEXT></DOC>
