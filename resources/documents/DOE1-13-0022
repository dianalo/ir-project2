The exit line temperature was restricted to 100/sup0/C to prevent the decomposition of product methanol. The methanol yieldimproved with increasing pressure. The optimum methanol yield was achievedat 65 atm at 5% O/sub 2/ concentration. A comparison between the oxidationof methane and the oxidation of natural gas was made. The reduction inoperating reaction temperature can be attributed to the presence of ethaneand propane in the natural gas which appear to sensitize the reaction.Air was used as the oxidant in place of oxygen for the oxidation of naturalgas. Increasing the diameter of the reactor increased the reactant volumeflow rate. The methanol yield improved approximately 10% over a glasslined surface. The larger diameter reactor allowed the insertion of bothcatalyst coated tubes and packed catalysts, and a determination of theireffect on the oxidation of natural gas. The highest methanol yields wereobtained over an inert wall such as glass or teflon. It was demonstratedthat the reaction can be run continously using a recirculation systemwhich allowed the recycling of unconverted natural gas. The recycle systemprovided for collection of the product methanol and water and the removalof carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The residual gas consisting ofmethane, ethane, and propane was repressurized, remixed with oxygen andreintroduced into the reactor. An economic study is summarized.</TEXT></DOC>
