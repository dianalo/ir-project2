The official, Robert Costello, undersecretary of defense foracquisiton, wrote a memo to Defense Secrertary Frank Carluccisuggesting that top Pentagon officials _ including himself _ begiven veto power over searches of contractor facilities.   The suggestion to involve politically appointed Pentagonofficials in what is normally a law enforcement function was madein a May 5 memo, a copy of which was obtained by The AssociatedPress.   Costello is to testify Wednesday at a House Armed ServicesCommittee investigation into the procurement process, a hearingtriggered by allegations of widespread corruption in the defensecontracting industry.   Costello's memo was written before the existence of a massivetwo-year investigation of defense contract fraud became publiclyknown on June 14.   That probe has relied heavily on a series of nationwide searchesof private consultants' offices and contractor facilities inattempts looking for evidence of possible bribery of governmentofficials in return for classified documents.   Costello's idea was rejected by Carlucci, whose spokesman calledthe idea ``something Carlucci doesn't want to be associated with.''   The spokesman, Air Force Col. David J. Shea, acknowledged,however, that Carlucci initially responded ``This is a good idea.''But he said that response referred to Costello's suggestion toestablish a training program for Defense Department investigators,not to the prior approvalof search warrants.   Costello's suggestion also was turned down by Pentagon InspectorGeneral June Gibbs Brown, according to a Pentagon source, speakingonly on condition he not be named.   The source said Ms. Brown ``indicated to Mr. Carlucci theDepartment of Justice will not accept a procedure whereby use ofsearch warrants by defense criminal investigative organizationswould require concurrence of any official outside the office ofinspector general.''   Costello's memo said ``the appropriate level of review and@orapproval should be at least (Deputy Secretary of Defense) Will Taftor myself, and quite possibly yourself.''   Costello's anger was triggered by a search Feb. 25 at theElectronic andamp; Space Division of Emerson Electric Co. near St. Louis,in a fraud investigation that is apparently not related to thenationwide probe.   The search was partly based on an affidavit by John E. Lake, anagent of the Defense Criminal Investigation Service. The companyresponded to the search with a court suit asking that it bedeclared unconstitutional.   In court papers filed by Emerson, the company said governmentagents lied or left out important information when they asked for asearch warrant.   The government's application included an affidavit by Lake, whosaid that in October, he began investigating ``fraudulent billingsfor contracts performed for the Department of Defense.''   Authorities said Emerson violated federal law by billing thegovernment for parts that were installed on vehicles the companywas making for Egypt under a separate contract.   Emerson acknowledged it transferred the parts but said that itdid so under a written ``borrow and pay back'' agreement with thegovernment.   Costello complained in his memo that ``only minimalconsideration was given to executing the search warrant in a lesssensational manner.''   He complained that no prior notice was given to Emerson'sattorneys, and added, ``To send 19 DCIS agents, one customs agent,and several Missouri state troopers directly to the plant appearsto me to be an unwarranted show of force that invites sensationaltreatment in the press.''   Costello recommended that Carlucci ask Ms. Brown to ``develop aprogram within the IG's office to train DoD investigators ontechniques to obtain evidence in the least forceful and sensationalmanner'' _ a suggestion that was accepted.   Explaining Carlucci's views on Costello's suggestion, Shea saidthe secretary ``does not agree that searches should be reviewed orapproved by him, Mr. Taft or Mr. Costello which might be perceivedas interference in the conduct of criminal investigations.''   But Shea said Carlucci has asked Ms. Brown to ``develop a policyto ensure uniformity and consistency for searches on corporatepremises by all defense criminal investigative organizations.''   Her suggestions, approved by Carlucci, require that:   _Search warrant applications and affidavits are coordinated inadvance with appropriate legal advisers.   _Clearances to use search warrants as an investigative techniqueare approved at an appropriate level within the defense criminalinvestigtive organizations.   _Searches be conducted in a manner that will balance the needfor compliance with the need to ensure minimal disruption withcontractor operations.   _Defense criminal investigative organizations receive adequatetraining regarding this policy.</TEXT></DOC>
