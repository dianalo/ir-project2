Security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, suggestedSheik Abdul Karim Obeid may have been kidnapped in a swap for theAmerican, Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, or for three Israelisoldiers captured in south Lebanon more than three years ago.   President Bush said he did not know if the incident would helpHiggins or the other eight American hostages but added, ``I don'tthink kidnapping and violence helps the cause of peace'' in theMiddle East.   The Israeli army confirmed the incident and accused Obeid, 33,of instigating attacks on Israel and of being a major Hezbollahfigure.   An Israel army spokesman, Col. Raanan Gissin, indicated a swapwas possible. ``Clearly when you capture one of their (Hezbollah's)top leaders, it can deter terrorism and you also have a certainamount of leverage in your hands,'' he said.   Gissin said Obeid and two ``assistants'' seized with him were``safely in Israeli hands and undergoing questioning.''   Killed in the overnight raid was at least one resident of thevillage of Jibchit, about 20 miles from the Israeli border and 35miles south of Beirut.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the UnitedStates was not consulted about or involved in the abduction.   Lebanese police said the commandos entered Jibchit about 1:30a.m. after landing in a helicopter outside town.   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity in linewith standing regulations, said about 12 commandos withsilencer-equipped pistols surrounded Obeid's building, then knockedon the door of his apartment and forced their way in.   They fled with Obeid; his cousin, Ahmed Obeid; and a friend,Majid Fahs, the spokesman said.   Obdeid's wife, Mona, was locked in a room with her hands tiedand her mouth taped shut, the spokesman said.   Mrs. Obeid, interviewed later, said one of the attackers spokeArabic. ``He told me he would kill me if I yelled,'' she said.   The Israeli military refused to give details of the raid, butIsrael television reported the commandos blew offthe front door ofObeid's apartment with plastic explosives and whisked the three menaway in a helicopter in less than a half-hour.   Lebanese police said a neighbor, Hussein Abu Zeid, opened thedoor of his apartment to find out what was happening and was shotto death. Israel radio said the man killed was a bodyguard forObeid.   Another neighbor, Fayez Shokor, who lives across the street fromObeid, said three helicopters were involved in the operation.   ``I heard a suspicious noise... and went out to the balcony. Iheard someone shouting (in Arabic) `Kill me! I won't go withyou!''' said Shokor, a member of the mainstream Amal militia, whichhas been fighting Hezbollah for control of Lebanon's Shiite Moslems.   Shokor said he and five other Amal militiamen rushed to a nearbyvalley in search of Obeid but came under Israeli fire.   ``Two Israeli helicopters hovered overhead and they startedshooting at us with machine guns,'' he said. ``As the clash wasunder way, a third helicopter took off, apparently carrying theIsraelis, Sheik Obeid and his companions.''   Iran's Foreign Ministry said in a statement: ``This shamelessact by the Zionist regime will not remain unanswered by the Moslemand combatant forces.'' The statement, carried by the officialIslamic Republic News Agency, said the operation was a ``clearexample of state terrorism.''   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, urged Moslems to``let out their anger until Obeid is released safely.''   Obeid is reputed to be the spiritual guide of Hezbollah in southLebanon. He has denied involvement with the fundamentalist group,believed to be an umbrella for the kidnappers of 17 foreignhostages in Lebanon.   Higgins, 44, of Danville, Ky., headed an observer group attachedto the U.N. peacekeeping force in South Lebanon. Security sourcessaid he was briefly held at Obeid's apartment after his abductionnear the southern port city of Tyre on Feb. 17, 1988.   His captors, the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth,believed to be one of Hezbollah's affiliates, later took Higgins toanother hideout.   The State Department and Israel described Obeid as a Hezbollahmember.   Britain, which has three citizens held hostage in Lebanon, saidthe raid could hurt the hostages, but Gissin said it would helpthem.   ``We believe Hezbollah leaders will now think twice beforeharming their hostages,'' he said.   Two Israeli soldiers, Rahamim Alsheikh and Yossi Fink werecaptured Feb. 17, 1986, when guerrillas ambushed their patrol inIsrael's self-proclaimed ``security zone'' in south Lebanon.Israeli officials said they believe Hezbollah was behind thekidnapping.   An air force navigator, Ron Arad, was captured by Shiitemilitiamen on October 16, 1986, when his plane was shot down insouth Lebanon.   The American held longest in Lebanon is Terry Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent of The Associated Press, who waskidnapped March 16, 1985. A Shiite Moslem group, the pro-IranianIslamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, claims to hold him.</TEXT></DOC>
