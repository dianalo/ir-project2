There had been persistent reports of upcoming Cabinet changes toquiet calls for Roh's resignation and stop public criticism of howthe government has handled recent unrest.   The shuffle involved the home, construction, communications,labor, health- social affairs ministers, and the first minister ofstate for political affairs.   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon and other 16 ministers wereretained.   Chief presidential press secretary Lee Soo-jung said the partialshakeup was intended to restore law and order, ensure citizens'welfare and safety and strengthen national security.   In South Korea, periodic Cabinet shuffles stop the president fromhaving to take responsibility for government failures. In reality,however, Cabinet ministers have little autonomy.   In recent months there have been violent anti-government protestsby dissidents and radical students calling for Roh to step down.They have, however, dwindled in recent weeks with police blockingmany rallies. The radical students lack public support because oftheir extremist views.   Former Attorney General Suh Dong-kwon, 56, replaced Park Seh-jikas head of the Agency for National Security Planning, the mainintelligence agency.   It was not immediately known if a new government post would begiven to Park, who was chief organizer of the 1988 Summer OlympicGames in Seoul.   Recent incidents, including the secret visits to North Korea bydissident leader Moon Ik-hwan, opposition lawmaker Suh Kyong-won anda disident student leader were thought to have prompted Park'sdismissal. South Korea forbids visits by its citizens to thecommunist north.
