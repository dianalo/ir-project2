Poland's first competitive election in four decades could endthe Communist Party's political monopoly at a time when otherSoviet bloc leaders are considering democratic change withoutlosing power.   The emergence of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1985 andhis call for openness and economic restructuring gave Kremlinapproval to reforms that leaders in Poland and Hungary where quickto embrace.   Leaders of other East bloc countries such as Bulgaria, Romania,East Germany and Czechoslovakia still cringe at a possiblechallenge to their power.   The stimulus for change in the Soviet Union and Hungary comesfrom reform-minded communists. In Poland, an independent oppositionstrongly influenced by the Solidarity independent union movementhas led the reform drive.   Party and opposition reformers in Eastern Europe hope change canbe achieved gradually rather than by a revolution that mightdisrupt Europe's postwar alliances.   A Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslavakia in 1968ended a Communist Party effort to reform socialism.   Poland's fledgling opposition took a different path. In the1970s a unique alliance between workers and oppositionintellectuals was forged that paved the way for Solidarity, whichwas born in August 1981 and led the fight for political reform.   Solidarity directly challenged the Communist Party's claim torule in the name of the working class, and the party tried to crushthe union in the Dec. 13, 1981, martial-law crackdown thatdemoralized much of the nation.   But Gorbachev revived hope that change was possible.   After a Polish political amnesty in 1986, two waves of strikeslast year and continuing economic crisis, the opposition was strongenough again in 1988 to press its demands for legalization ofSolidarity.   After two months of talks, the two sides reached a historicaccord April 5 that legalized the union again after a seven-yearban in exchange for opposition support of partially democraticelections to parliament.   ``There is no doubt without Gorbachev the situation in Polandcould not have happened,'' said historian Bronislaw Geremek, aclose adviser to Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.   The March elections in the Soviet Union to the Congress ofPeople's Deputies do not go as far as Poland in allowing voters tofreely choose their representatives.   The Communist Party of the Soviet Union retained control ofaccess to the ballot, limiting the number of independent candidatesand cutting off anyone who challenged its ultimate authority.   But for the first time in 71 years, Soviet voters were able tochoose between rival candidates, and in rare cases radicalreformers like Boris Yeltsin were able to muster enough popularsupport to be seated in the congress.   As a result, a Soviet parliamentary session going on now hasbeen marked by heated debates on such subjects such as the Sovietinvasion of Afghanistan, the KGB, the performance of top officialsand the sovereignty of individiual republics.   By contrast, in Poland candidates totally independent of theparty were allowed to stand for 161 seats of the Sejm, as theexisting parliament is called, and for all 100 seats of the newlycreated Senate, the East bloc's first democratically electedlegislative chamber.   Some Poles criticized Solidarity for accepting partially freeelections with no guarantee that authorities will keep a pledge tohold completely democratic elections in four years.   Historian Geremek said Solidarity had no choice.   ``We decided to accept what was possible ... because there weretwo dangers,'' he said. ``One was the risk of a social explosionthat later even political decisions could not solve and we thoughtthe international context might not last.''   Opposition activists in Poland meanwhile express hope that theHungarian Communist Party's commitment to a multi-party system mayinfluence Polish leaders, who so far have rejected new politicalparties as such.   Parliamentary elections are due in Hungary next year and for thefirst time since the communists consolidated power in 1948, otherparties will be able to take part.   ``If Poland got a contract at too low a level, we think theHungarians will do better and that will influence our situation,''Geremek said.</TEXT></DOC>
