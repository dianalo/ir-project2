Another group of blacks tossed firebombs and raided a homeoutside the city of Pietermaritzburg, stabbing to death a17-year-old woman and injuring a 20-year-old woman, police said.   Both black-on-black attacks occurred in Natal province, wheremore than 1,000 blacks have been killed in faction fighting in thepast 18 months.   The sketchy police unrest report, which covers incidents from theprevious 24 hours, did not release any additional details.   The main combatants in the faction fighting are Inkatha, apolitical organization headed by Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi,and the United Democratic Front, the nation's largest anti-apartheidcoalition. The front was banned in February.   Buthelezi also opposes apartheid, but many United DemocraticFront supporters view him as too conservative because heparticipates in the government's homeland system and refuses toendorse confrontational tactics such as economic sanctions, boycottsand protests.   Buthelezi accuses the front of supporting the bombing andsabotage campaign waged by the outlawed African National Congressguerrilla movement.   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote innational affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy andmaintain separate schools and districts.</TEXT></DOC>
