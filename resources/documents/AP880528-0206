Among the 13 major international credit markets, public debtclimbed to $9.40 trillion in 1987 from $7.53 trillion in theprevious year, according to a report released this past week bySalomon Brothers Inc.   That was an 11.3 percent gain as measured by constant exchangerates. But in U.S. dollar terms the increase was 25 percent,reflecting the dollar's depreciation, the report said.   The need for credit throughout the world has grown by leaps andbounds in recent years as corporations expand, economies change andtrading becomes more globalized.   Eight years ago, the world bond market, which includesgovernment, corporate and municipal issues, totaled about $2.83trillion, about a fifth of last year's figure, according to Salomon.   The Salomon report, its seventh annual, had few major changesfrom the previous year, except that the market share of U.S.dollar-denominated bonds issued in 1987 continued to fall while theJapanese market gained a bit more ground.   Also, primary market activity in the foreign and Eurobondsectors slowed in 1987. ``Most of the drop can be attributed to asteep falloff in U.S dollar-denominated issuance, reflectingdiminished demand for U.S. denominated assets,'' the report said.   The drop in market share among U.S. dollar-denominated bonds andnotes, to 44.3 percent from 48.7 percent in 1986, was largely dueto a $70 billion decline in the fiscal 1987 federal deficit, thereport said.   It said outstanding Treasury issues increased by 12 percent,compared to a 15 percent rise in 1986. The volume of governmentagency debt also climbed at a slower pace, 23 percent, vs. 27percent in 1986. The gains in municipal and corporate issues,though, were up from the previous year, according to the report.   Despite the drop, the U.S. dollar bond market remained by farthe largest major bond market in the world last year, with publicissues totaling $4.165 trillion, compared to $3.66 trillion in 1986.   The Japanese yen bonds came in a distant second, with publicissues totaling $2.12 trillion for a 22.6 percent market share, andWest German deutschemark was third, with $811.5 billion issues andan 8.6 percent share, Salomon said.   The others were: Italian lira, $540.1 billion and 5.7 percentshare; French franc, $336.8 billion and 3.6 percent; Britishsterling, $332.7 billion and 3.5 percent; Belgian franc, $196.8billion and 2.1 percent; Canadian dollar, $192.9 billion and 2.1percent; Swiss franc, $171.7 billion and 1.8 percent; Danish krone,$171.2 billion and 1.8 percent; Swedish krona, $160.6 billion and1.7 percent; Dutch guilder, $128.4 billion and 1.4 percent; andAustralian dollar, $73.6 billion and 0.8 percent, Salomon said.   Although many more countries issue bonds, Salomon doesn'tinclude them in its count because their markets are less developedor less liquid.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions May 28-29</NOTE></DOC>
