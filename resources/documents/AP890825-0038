Caught between the opposing demands of shrimpers andenvironmentalists, the agency has until Sept. 8 to draft finalregulations to hold down mortality rates among five endangeredspecies of sea turtles.   The conservation group says it has been unable to obtainbiological opinions from Commerce Department scientists on the mosteffective way of preventing sea turtle deaths.   ``I don't know of any attempt to suppress any scientificfindings, any legal opinions, or any counsel from anyone within thedepartment on this issue,'' said Commerce spokesman Brian Gorman.   At issue is whether shrimpers must be required to equip theirnets with devices that allow turtles to escape, the method backed byenvironmentalists, or whether they should restrict their tow timesand check their nets before the submerged turtles drown, the choiceof many Gulf Coast shrimpers.   Under temporary regulations, shrimpers are being required to pulltheir nets every 105 minutes or use the turtle excluder devices,TEDs.</TEXT><NOTE>FTC Formalizing New Rules on Food Specials</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Grocery stores may offer rain checks orsubstitutes when they run out of advertised specials or may specifybeforehand that availability is limited, the Federal TradeCommission says.   A final rule, to be published Monday in the Federal Register andtake effect four days later, amends one adopted in 1971 thatrequired grocers to stock enough advertised items to meetanticipated demand.   That rule had rarely been enforced and the commission voted inApril 1988 to approve making the rule change, making Thursday'saction largely a formality.   The FTC began reviewing its earlier rule in 1984 and determinedthat the cost of compliance outweighed the benefits. According tothe review, the 1971 rule imposed an estimated $132 million to $370million in costs on retail food stores, with those costs passed onto consumers.</TEXT><NOTE>Minorities Seen Gaining in House From 1990s Redistricting</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A demographic expert says minorities stand agood chance of gaining seats in the House after congressionaldistrict lines are redrawn based on results of the 1990 Census.   William O'Hare, director of policy studies at the PopulationReference Bureau, also predicted that ``there is going to be amountain of litigation'' over issues such as adjustments forundercounted minorities, whether to exclude illegal aliens andinclusion of military personnel overseas in the count used forreapportionment.   In the 1991-92 reapportionment, O'Hare said, ``the states thatare likely to gain the most congressional seats _ for example,California, Texas, Florida _ all have large minority populations.''   He said the country's Hispanic population was expected to show aparticularly strong gain, from about 14.5 million in 1980 up to aprojected 22 million in the 1990 Census _ with most of the increaseconcentrated in Sunbelt states.   Asked what net gain of minority members he expects there will bein the House, O'Hare said: ``Certainly half a dozen to 10 is notunreasonable. ... I would say that's optimistic, but notoutlandishly optimistic.''   The 435-seat House has 36 minority members _ 22 blacks, nineHispanics, four Asian-Americans and one American Indian.   Blacks make up about 12 percent of the U.S. population but haveonly 1.5 percent of elected officials, while Hispanics comprise 8percent of the population but are less than 2 percent of electedofficials, O'Hare said.   The Population Reference Bureau describes itself as a private,non-partisan organization that tries to increase public awarenessand understanding of population issues.</TEXT></DOC>
