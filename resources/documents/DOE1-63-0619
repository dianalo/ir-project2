The main resourcedevelopment problem is efficiently extracting the gas from the reservoir.Future production depends on a combination of gas price and technologicaladvances. Gas production can be enhanced by fracturing. Studies haveshown that many aspects of fracture design and gas production are influencedby properties of the rock matrix. Computer models for stimulation proceduresrequire accurate knowledge of flow properties of both the rock matrixand the fractured regions. In the proposed work, these properties willbe measured along with advanced core analysis procedures aimed at understandingthe relationship between pore structure and properties. The objectiveof this project is to develop reliable core analysis techniques for measuringthe petrophysical properties of tight gas sands. Recent research hasindicated that the flow conditions in the reservoir can be greatly enhancedby the presence of natural fractures, which serve as a transport pathfor gas from the less permeable matrix. The study is mainly concernedwith the dependence of flow in tight gas matrix and haled tectonic fractureson water saturation and confining pressure. This dependencey is to berelated to the detailed pore structure of tight sands as typified bycores recovered in the Multi-Well experiment. 22 refs., 34 figs., 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
