Air ForceDefense ContractsMinicomputersStandards.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>AFCAC 251 Marks Evolutionary ChangeandM;When the Air Force begins this year to install the thousands of ATandamp;T 3B2minicomputers it will buy through its AFCAC 251 contract, the service islikely to eliminate some clerical jobs, make more information available tomanagers, automate small offices and increase efficiency.andM;These kinds of benefits, rather than major leaps forward in technology, arewhat the Air Force is buying for its $929 million, Air Force and Navyofficials said.andP;  Most important of all, they said, the contract establishes astandard Defense Department multiuser system.andM;&quot;I don't expect them to drastically affect Air Force computing, but I doexpect them to have a very significant impact on our efforts forstandardization and integration of systems,&quot; said Maj.andP;  Gen.andP;  Robert H.andO;Ludwig, the Air Force's assistant chief of staff for command, control,communications and computer (C4) systems.andM;In the long run, the contract should push DOD further in the direction ofvendor-independent, open systems architectures, the officials said.andP;  Theircomments were based on the assumption that the contract would withstand aprotest that Honeywell Federal Systems Inc. filed with the General ServicesAdministration Board of Contract Appeals.andM;Robert A. Green, program manager for communications technology and standardsat the Naval Data Automation Command, said the AFCAC 251 systems will includesome advanced features unavailable in existing systems but probably will notgive users computing capabilities they did not have already.andM;Ludwig said he views the contract as &quot;a stepping stone&quot; toward a Posixenvironment and adherence to Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile(GOSIP) communications standards.andM;Other steps toward this architecture have included standard microcomputercontracts -- the Zenith Data Systems' Z-248 and the next-generation micro, tobe set in the Desktop III contract this year -- and the recently awardedUnified Local Area Network Architecture contract, Ludwig said.andM;Green said a standard hardware suite including AFCAC 251 systems will reducethe number of different Navy systems, and having fewer types of hardware willfacilitate the service's transition to GOSIP.andM;In addition, he said, the standardized AFCAC 251 user interface should cuttraining time and costs.andP;  Because Navy personnel frequently move from job tojob, they waste a lot of time being trained each time they begin work on anew system, Green said.andP;  &quot;With this contract, we won't have to retrain peoplewhen they move from one site to another,&quot; he said.andM;Andrew E. Bilinski, deputy assistant secretary of the Air Force for C4systems, said the contract will reduce the technical risk of futureautomation projects for the 3B2 platform because system designers will knowin advance what hardware they will use.andM;&quot;What you focus on is the new software development,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;You tell thesoftware developers, 'Here's the platform.andP;  Give me software to run onthat.'&quot;andM;In an era of tightening federal budgets, AFCAC 251 will save the servicesmoney, Bilinski said.andP;  The $929 million contract value is 70 percent lowerthan Air Force officials had predicted.andP;  He also said the services willpreserve their investments in the nearly 300,000 Z-248s, which can beconnected to the ATandamp;T system.andM;The Desktop III machines will connect as well, he said.andP;  &quot;It gives the user awhole lot of different options,&quot; he said.andM;The greatest benefits to users are likely to result from the high degree ofconnectivity the contract will offer.andP;  Bilinski said AFCAC 251 will allowsmall two-user systems at lower levels in the service to interface with largesystems supporting up to 128 users.andM;Because the system will be installed at every level of the service'shierarchy, data processing capability will be available even to smallsquadrons.andP;  &quot;That's simply something we do not have now,&quot; Bilinski said.andM;Ludwig said the first large-scale computer program that will use AFCAC 251equipment, Personnel Concept III (PC-III), will take advantage of thesebenefits.andP;  PC-III, a personnel system to be used at 126 Air Force basesworldwide, was delayed to coincide with the AFCAC 251 award, Ludwig said.andM;PC-III users will enter information on personnel changes into their ATandamp;Tcomputers, rather than reporting the transactions to a central office forprocessing.andP;  The system should eliminate about 1,500 personnel managementjobs, Bilinski said.andM;Maj.andP;  James G. McConeghy, small-computer program manager at the Air ForceStandard Systems Center in Montgomery, Ala., said many lower-level officeswill be automated for the first time through the AFCAC 251 contract.andM;Another Air Force program, the Cargo Movement Operational System to trackcargo through the service's transportation network, also will use AFCAC 251hardware at lower command levels.andM;Ludwig said more than 100 systems will be used at every transportation hub inthe service.andM;Similarly, many of the systems the Navy will buy are to be deployed at smallactivities, Green said.andP;  The systems will be used for the Nay's Bases andStations Information Systems (BASIS), a large-scale program to automateadministrative offices on Navy bases.andM;Under BASIS, AFCAC 251 equipment will automate base police stations, foodservice offices and other &quot;small activities that don't have a big daddy backin D.C.andP;  looking out for them,&quot; Green said.andM;He said BASIS program officials are developing applications and databasesoftware that will run on the ATandamp;T equipment with minimal conversion.andP;  Theofficials put off buying hardware specifically for BASIS so they could cashin one the standardization benefits offered by the Air Force contract, hesaid.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
