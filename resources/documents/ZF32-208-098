(Products).andO;Product:   G2 Real-Time Expert System (Expert system development software)(Usage).andO;Topic:     Process controlExpert Systems.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>From the wreckage of failure cruise new leaders in process controlandM;Once upon a time, a huge ship was one of the prides of a new Americanindustry.andP;  Unfortunately, the ship sunk and took with it a lot of investors'money.andP;  No, I'm not talking about the Titanic.andP;  I'm talking about LISPMachine Inc. (LMI), one of the original AI ploneers, which sank of its ownbloated weight and exaggerated claims.andP;  Like the Titanic, few survived(actually, the Titanic probably had ore survivors), but those who did manageto get off lived to tell the tale.andP;  In this case, those survivors formed acompany called Gensym, now the leader in the real-time expert-systembusiness.andM;Gensym, located in Burlington, Mass., was founded in the mid-1980s by the LMIstaff members who created the Picon expert-system shell for process control.andO;Although it never really got Picon up and running, that didn't stop LMI'srusting hulk from suing the team members who went off to form Gensym.andP;  Aftera lengthy battle, the suit was dropped, LMI slipped beneath the surface, andGensym emerged as the first player in a very hot market: real-timeintelligent systems for process control and monitoring.andP;  Its first and stillprimary product, G2, was originally a LISP machine-only package, but as we'veseen in the last three years, there's more business out in the world of DEC,Sun, and IBM.andP;  G2 has changed and adapted accordingly.andM;THE PROCESS GAMEandM;Process control is crucial for dozens of industries industries ranging frompower utilities to petroleum refining to automotive manufacturing.andP;  Thisapplication is significant because it lets a system comprising various typesof equipment be singularly controlled as part as an overall process.andP;  In anuclear reactor, for instance, a process-control station might be monitoringthe amount of energy output, movement of water through cooling systems,internal and external temperatures, load handling, and several otheractivities taking place simultaneously within the nuclear environment.andP;  Ofcourse, the same control must also alert operators to hazardous situations,offer a way to rectify the problem, and provide alternate means of operationin case of danger.andM;As borne out by the Three Mile Island and Bhopal industrial accidents, peopleare the weak link in an integrated system.andP;  Human error is often to blame fordisasters, either because operators failed to respond to a warning or had somany process components to monitor that they didn't realize the danger untiltoo late.andP;  But human error doesn't result only in international cries ofoutrage-it can be something as simple as not tracking the amount of chemicalsin a mixture or the speed of an assembly line.andP;  Both errors result in ruinedor interrupted production, costing companies in downtime and wastedmaterials.andM;The reason to bring expert systems into the loop is obvious: minimize humanerror and increase monitor levels by having an expert system continually inplace to &quot;watch&quot; and analyze data from the process components.andP;  The controlthen becomes part of the expert system's function, as do recommendationsabout how aberrations should be handled.andP;  In the best of all possible worlds,an expert system could theoretically control every aspect of a process, fromstartup to crisis shutdown.andM;However, processes are continuous, which means that they don't operate for afew minutes, wait around for a while, and then go back to work.andP;  They arecontinuous, which means that problems or changes within the system have to beaddressed immediately.andP;  As most of us learned from the history ofexpert-system development, quickness and speed were not always of paramountimportance in getting a job done.andM;Certain expert systems have been known to run for hours at a time beforeproviding a solution to a problem.andP;  Process-control environments don't havevery many minutes-let alone hours-to respond to unusual situations and havetraditionally avoided the standard expert-system development tools because oftheir processing time.andP;  Some experts have estimated that the Bhopal chemicalaccident began and was out of control in less than 10 minutes.andP;  Clearly, anexpert system that tarried too long in finding a workable answer to somedifficulty could end up as so much melted plastic and silicone.andM;G2 IN THE FLESHandM;This niche was first addressed by Gensym and its G2 package and now by newcompanies like Mitech and Talarian, with older vendors like Neuron Data andInference getting into the act.andP;  G2 is primarily a workstation package withmost of its applications running on Suns and SPARCstations, as well as VAXsand even Macintoshes.andM;One of the company's first public applications was with Reliable Water, acompany that specializes in the treatment of impure water and, most notably,the conversion of saltwater into fresh water.andP;  The company built adesalination plant in Grand Cayman that makes Caribbean  water fresh andusable for the island population.andP;  Given the limited amount of technicalexpertise available in such small places, the company installed G2 to monitorthe facility and its processes.andM;The system requires virtually no human intervention and is designed to hand eall normal and aberrant situations on its own through the use of sensors thatmonitor specific machine and system operations.andP;  This program was first putonto Macintoshes but has since been ported to Sun SPARCstations.andP;  Similarstations have been built at other American offshore sites such as the CanaryIslands.andM;Probably nowhere is process control as critical or visible as at MissionControl in Houston's johnson Space Center.andP;  The center is developingapplications using G2 to assist in monitoring signals in real-time crucial tospace-shuttle missions.andP;  The applications will analyze flight telemetry andprovide information on navigation and course guidance, as well as data oncommunications status.andM;Working in conjunction with other equipment, the G2 application can processinformation from a real-time data stream of more than 300 data points persecond.andP;  Because this data is in real-time (or as close to it as possible),it can be used to make continuous corrections to the flight plan and controloperations during each shuttle mission.andP;  johnson has G2 running on severalhardware types, including the omnipresent SPARCstations and DEC's DECstationand VAXstations.andM;As past shuttle missions have shown, human error is a constant concern atNASA (ranking right up there with weather conditions), and minimization ofminor yet potentially fatal oversights can only benefit the space agency.andO;This case is one of those where expert systems can prove their worth intaking over the kinds of routine procedures that occasionally slip byfatigued or overworked humans.andM;Gensym has a slew of G2s in place in some 20 countries.andP;  The company isworking with Texaco to monitor the process of diverting different grades ofoil for refining into a network of delivery tanks, and Texaco is usingeverything from Texas Instruments' MicroExplorer to Data General's Aviionmachine for development and delivery.andP;  Gensym's French distributor,Cognitech, is assisting the French transportation agency in developing anapplication for monitoring and analyzing the flow of vehicular and pedestriantraffic in Paris.andP;  Ultimately, this program is to be used to control themovement of people through the city by activating traffic signals based ondata regarding heavily travelled or impeded routes.andP;  Gensym also has asite-license agreement with DuPont, which may be one of the all-time biggestmembers of the process-control community, especially in chemical-basedproduction.andM;My very favorite G2 application, though, has been developed for use onHewlett-Packard machines in the almost completed Biosphere 11, located inSouthern Arizona.andP;  For those of you not famillar with Biosphere, it is acompletely self-contained, glass-enclosed ecosystem that models the earth.andO;This spring, eight experts (one each from various scientific disciplines suchas medicine, biology, and so on) will be locked into the Biosphere for twoyears, with thousands of plants, animals, and insects that complete thisartificial world.andM;The idea behind Biosphere is to study the earth's ecosystems in microcosm.andO;Everything inside the Biosphere will be grown, recycled, and put to work asif the environment had no access to outside supplies.andP;  It will be a chance tolook at the world literally under glass and to gauge how well humans willlive and work in an environment that could be a forerunner of spacecolonization.andM;Gensym and HP are putting G2 on RISC workstations to monitor some of theautomated processes of Biosphere, including air conditioning, ventilation,water flow, and other critical operations that will keep Biosphere in properworking order.andP;  It will be used by the corps of scientists and engineersresponsible for ensuring that Biosphere and its inhabitants are maintained ina constant, livable environment.andM;REAL-TIME PROFITSandM;Gensym has deployed more than 500 of its G2 packages worldwide, at a cost ofupwards of $20,000 per copy.andP;  The company's revenues for 1990 were $8million, which makes it the same size as some of the more traditionalexpert-system shell vendors, many of whom had a five or six year headstart.andO;AIthough its origins are somewhere at the bottom of a watery AI shipwreck,Gensym has sailed quite comfortably into a market niche that needs viableexpert systems as much as the Titanic needed more life boats.andM;Harvey P. Newquist III is CEO of The Relayer Group, Scottsdale, Ariz., whichpublishes the AI Trends newsletter.andP;  He can be reached through AI Expert.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
