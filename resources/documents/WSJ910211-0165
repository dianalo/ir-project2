Germany's policy of high interest rates has whacked thealready weakened economies of Britain, France and Italy, andas a result is putting the EMS through its worst strains infour years.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;{The pressure is} already making itself felt ratherbadly,&quot; says Giles Keating, economist with Credit SuisseFirst Boston in London. Britain is in a worsening recession,with bankruptcies rising and banks burdened with bad debt.The economies of France and Italy have both slowed to thebrink of recession.   But so far, Europe seems to be weathering the storm. Morethan a week after Germany jarred its partners by raising keyinterest rates half a percentage point, relative calm hasreturned to currency desks, with traders apparently acceptingassurances that the exchange-rate mechanism won't be tamperedwith for now. Indeed, France, Italy and Britain allreaffirmed their commitment to stick to present exchange-rateparities.   France, which functions as the political linchpin of thesystem, remains adamant in resisting any realignment thatwould enable the government to lower interest rates andaccept a devaluation of the franc against the mark. Italy andthe U.K. have adopted similar stances.   Germany's economy, in contrast with those of its bigEuropean partners, is booming with the surge in investmentbrought on by the country's unification. &quot;Germany is in acompletely different cycle from the rest of Europe,&quot; saysEugenio Namor, senior economist with the San Paolo Bank ofTurin, Italy. &quot;It's complete incompatibility.&quot;   But with Europe opposed to any currency realignment, manycountries will have to postpone the interest-rate cuts theirslowing economies seem to be begging for.   The Europeans' resistance to realigning the exchange-ratemechanism is, among other things, a political statement.Since the EMS is the first stage of a more far-reachingscheme of monetary integration, member states want todemonstrate their loyalty to it.   &quot;It's all they've got to show for economic and monetaryunion right now,&quot; said Richard O'Brien, chief economist withthe American Express Bank in London.   Market psychology offers a further rationale. Theexchange-rate mechanism hasn't been realigned since January1987. As a result, currency traders take the arrangement moreseriously than they used to, enabling currencies such as thefranc and the lira to gain from a perception of beingstronger and less-inflationary. British government officialsargue that the pound, which entered the EMS fully lastOctober, will similarly benefit if the government doesn'tseek a devaluation.   Traders figure that if the EMS continues to weather thecurrent strains, the arrangement will be perceived as evenstronger, paving the way for the EC states to lock inexchange rates and, eventually, adopt a single currency.   The Europeans' apparent willingness to stick with the EMScomes as a needed boost. &quot;The climate for unity has souredsomewhat,&quot; says Mr. O'Brien. Not only have the EuropeanCommunity members differed over how to respond to the Gulfwar, but economic strains historically have made nationalpopulations reluctant to surrender authority to ECinstitutions.   Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland lastweek, Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl made it clear thathe has little sympathy for European partners' complaintsabout German monetary policy. &quot;You have to accept theconsequences,&quot; he said. &quot;You can't have your cake and eat ittoo.&quot;   He said that all the EMS currencies had gained by linkageto the solid mark. If Germany were to let the mark weakenunder present circumstances, the entire EMS would suffer.&quot;Coordination can't mean a weakening of standards,&quot; he said.&quot;That would be the beginning of the end of what we haveachieved.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
