(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The League of Women Voters called offDemocratic and Republican debates scheduled for Sunday afterpresidential candidates in both parties showed little or nointerest in attending.   ``In essence, the candidates are snubbing nearly half thecountry two days before this critical election,'' said Carole Bucy,president of the League of Women Voters of Nashville.   The debates, which were to have been telecast from Nashville byCable News Network, would have come only two days before the20-state round of caucuses and primaries on March 8, or SuperTuesday.   League spokeswoman Janice Kaplan had said earlier in the day theDemocratic debate was definitely on and the Republican debate wouldproceed even if there were only two candidates.   The cancellation followed indications by Republican Bob Dolethat he was unlikely to join Jack Kemp for a two-man debate.   In Knoxville, where Dole spoke to a downtown rally, presssecretary Walt Riker said he doubted seriously that Dole wouldparticipate in the rally without Vice President George Bush.   Bush and Pat Robertson, a former television evangelist, bothadvised the League they would not show up.   Ms. Kaplan said Rep. Richard Gephardt ``told us this week he didnot want to debate in (Tennessee Sen.) Albert Gore's back yard,even though he has known all along the debate was in Nashville.''   Ms. Bucy said Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis had decided notto participate.   Gore's chief campaign spokesman, Mike Kopp, chided Gephardt andDukakis passing up the debates here. Both of them also skipped adebate last Sunday in Houston.   Kopp said Gephardt and Dukakis ``participated fully in thedebates that preceded the Iowa caucuses. Now these same candidatesare dodging these (Nashville and Houston) debates where they haveto talk about the issues.''   Sen. Paul Simon, who has said he would not campaign actively inSouthern-dominated Super Tuesday states, was apparently planning ontaking part in the Nashville debate.   Other Democrats in the running are Jesse Jackson and formerColorado Sen. Gary Hart.</TEXT></DOC>
