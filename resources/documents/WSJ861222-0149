For those members of the 100th Congress who are urging President Reagan to return to the SALT II limits and cap his presidency with an arms-control treaty, the Kennedy School report should be required reading.    &quot;What is most striking about the arms-control experience surveyed here is what it did not do,&quot; the report says. &quot;Those who hoped arms control would bring about major reductions in existing or planned {weapons} inventories or slow the introduction of new and more capable technologies have little grounds for satisfaction. Nor do those who looked to arms control as a means for constraining the emergence of a large, modern Soviet arsenal capable of destroying a significant proportion of U.S. strategic retaliatory forces.&quot;    Arms control may have somewhat slowed the pace of military expansion, the experts contend: &quot;Without arms control, both American and Soviet force totals probably would be higher than they are now.&quot; But the arms negotiating process hasn't done much to help U.S.-Soviet relations overall or to stem Soviet aggression, they add.    The review panel was headed by Albert Carnesale, a Kennedy School professor of public policy with a background in nuclear engineering and arms control. The study was co-authored by Richard Haass, a lecturer in public policy. The report (to be published next summer as a book by Ballinger) was commissioned last year by Kenneth Adelman, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.    Of SALT II, the study says that the treaty failed to achieve its &quot;major strategic objective&quot; of &quot;enhancing the survivability of both sides' retaliatory forces&quot; and didn't &quot;constrain significantly many qualitative improvements that have had a major impact on force structure and strategic stability.&quot; It notes, for instance, that the survivability of U.S. land-based missiles is now threatened by the roughly 12,000 Soviet warheads permitted by the treaty.    The report calls the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty &quot;arms control's chief accomplishment.&quot; Nonetheless, it says that the treaty &quot;may merely have codified the postponement of a race in defensive systems until advancing technologies made effective defenses possible.&quot;    In general, the Harvard panel criticizes the American body politic for expecting too much from arms control: &quot;Many American politicians preferred to ignore the fact that Moscow viewed SALT as a very narrow politico-military arrangement&quot; and &quot;as a means of managing the strategic competition with the United States.&quot; There is, it adds, &quot;an internal dynamic to Soviet military requirements which is only affected at the margins by U.S. actions.&quot;    Unilateral restraint by the U.S. in not deploying some new weapons systems hasn't induced reciprocal restraint by the U.S.S.R., the report says. Instead, the demands of Soviet military planners take precedence over arms-control negotiations. &quot;The arms-control process and/or unilateral restraint have little impact on the Soviet {defense} requirements process. On the contrary, it appears that Soviet {military} requirements are determining factors in their arms-control proposals and their acceptance of any final agreement.&quot;    The Kennedy School scholars pay particular attention to the problem of verifying compliance with arms restrictions and evidence of Soviet cheating. They cite &quot;a Soviet pattern of circumvention and apparent violation.&quot; Aside from the military implications, they say that Soviet &quot;noncompliance has eroded confidence in and support for the arms-control process,&quot; and this could become a &quot;perhaps insurmountable&quot; barrier to future arms-limitation progress.    Further, arms control hasn't stopped the &quot;U.S.-Soviet rivalry.&quot; The report says that &quot;the Soviets showed little restraint in the wake of SALT II's signing even though evidence was widespread that the agreement would have difficulty weathering any further deterioration in bilateral relations. Afghanistan comes to mind above all in this regard.&quot;    The arms-control process going back to the early 1960s did serve the Kremlin's purposes in &quot;codifying&quot; the Soviet Union's superpower status, the report says. But, it adds, &quot;Moscow made it clear that arms control as an element of detente could only have a marginal impact on tempering enduring historical conflicts with Western capitalist societies.&quot; In other words, arms control hasn't changed the Soviet Union's longstanding expansionist and militarist ambitions.    &quot;What emerges above all is the modesty of what arms control has wrought,&quot; concludes the Harvard report. &quot;If history reveals anything, it is that arms control has proved neither as promising as some had hoped or as dangerous as others had feared.&quot;    Perhaps the congressional proponents of SALT II will read this report and make explicit next year what it is that they are promising. </TEXT></DOC>
