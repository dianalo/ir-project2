Noel Pagan of Wellesley, Mass., wanted to prevent Mark Weaver'smother from removing the feeding tube that has kept Weaver alivesince a 1985 stabbing in Lewiston. Pagan, 29, served three years inprison for aggravated assault but still could face a murder chargewhen Weaver dies.   Probate Court Judge Dana Childs ruled Tuesday that Pagan couldnot intervene in the case because his interest in preventingWeaver's death has nothing to do with the family's request thatWeaver die peacefully.   ``Mr. Pagan's only claim to being an interested party stems fromthe possibility that when Mark Weaver suffers death following thewithdrawal of treatment, Pagan may be charged with Mark Weaver'smurder,'' the judge wrote.   Weaver's mother, Sylvia Lane, said she would proceed with plansto remove the feeding tube Thursday.   Weaver, 26, has been kept alive with the tube for nearly fouryears since his stab wounds left him in a vegetative state.   Lane said she was pleased with the judge's decision Tuesdaybecause it was her son's wish that he not be kept aliveartificially.   ``I don't see how he (Pagan) had any right to decide whathappens to his victim,'' she said.   Pagan's attorney, Robert Mullen, said he had told his clientthat an appeal would mean the case ``would drag out for months, andI couldn't tell him when it was going to stop.''   He said Pagan had agreed that it was in nobody's interest toappeal the ruling.   The attorney general's office said it will not decide whether tofile charges until after the death.   ``Until there's a death, there's no cause of death,'' spokesmanDavid Cheever said Tuesday.   State Deputy Attorney General Fernand LaRochelle said Mondaythat Pagan could be charged with murder if Weaver dies because itwould not be the same crime as assault. The Constitution protectsdefendants from being prosecuted twice for the same offense.</TEXT></DOC>
