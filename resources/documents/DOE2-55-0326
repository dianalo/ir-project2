Chondrogenesis was measured using a number of criteria, including(1) cartilage nodule production, (2) spectrophotometric determinationof the amount of bound Alcian blue dye, and (3) computer-assisted analysisof the spatial distribution (area) and density of Alcian blue presentin individual micromass colonies. Gamma radiation inhibited both cellproliferation and chondrogenesis in a dose- and time-dependent fashion.Administration of benzamide caused a significant increase in cell proliferationat 0.9 and 2.7 Gy, and in chondrogenesis at all doses. Cartilage noduleproduction was affected during the first 2 days (prior to 48 h) of cultureonly, suggesting that chondrocytic commitment occurs during this period.Cultures irradiated at 48 and 72 h produced the same number of nodulesas controls, but bound significantly less dye, presumably because ofdecreased cell numbers and/or cell synthesis products. Computer analysisof micromass colonies provided data similar to those collected spectrophotometrically,but displayed the advantages of (1) increased sensitivity to individualvariations, (2) the ability to collect data sets without having to poolthree or more colonies, and (3) long-term storage of raw images for lateranalysis.</TEXT></DOC>
