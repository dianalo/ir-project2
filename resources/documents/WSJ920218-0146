So much information will be offered, in the form ofmovies, music, pictures and text, that a majorentrepreneurial challenge of the next century will be to helpthe consumer manage it all. &quot;The world is totally goingdigital. Anything you're curious about will be in digitalform, accessible electronically,&quot; says William Gates III,chairman of Microsoft Corp. &quot;So, when you sit down to watch amovie at home, it won't just be the latest movies you'll beable to see but any movie ever made.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   A test in Cerritos, Calif., offers a real-life glimpse ofthe future. GTE Corp., the local telephone company, is pipingan array of services into the home of Jack and Pat Jakubik.Video-phone. Home shopping and bill-paying. Movies-on-demand.Cable TV. And, of course, telephone service.   &quot;You're talking about Buck Rogers in the 21st century,&quot;boasts Mr. Jakubik, &quot;and yeah, we've got it.&quot;   Since the experiment started a year and a half ago, theJakubiks have cut way back on video rentals, from an averageof 10 to one a week. Now, they select new movies from a&quot;menu&quot; on the TV screen. The family also has grown accustomedto speaking on the video-phone. The extroverted Mr. Jakubiksometimes makes calls in his bathrobe, but son Bobby is stilla tad self-conscious. &quot;I have to think about what I do infront of the camera,&quot; he says.   The family is less enamored of electronic shopping andbill-paying. &quot;I thought it would be really nice, but thathasn't been true,&quot; Pat says. That's partly because thecommand system isn't easy to use. The family manipulateson-screen menus with a remote-control device, but workingthrough a complex transaction is tedious.   The task of devising a more user-friendly digital systemhas already begun. The stakes are enormous. Any company thatcreates a software ritual -- a simple routine, shared widelyamong gadgets -- stands to collect a tax on virtuallyeverything from pocket phones to fax machines to TV remotecontrollers.   Both Microsoft and Apple Computer Inc., which back rivalapproaches to controlling a personal computer, are trying toadapt their operating systems to consumer electronics goods.In this area, Apple is allied with Sony Corp., and Microsoftis believed to be courting Matsushita Electric Works Ltd.,Sony's archrival in consumer electronics. A slew oflesser-known companies as well as Sony, Matsushita and otherelectronics manufacturers are working on ways to linktogether big-screen monitors, loud speakers, cable-TV andcompact-disk players.   While consumers can expect the problem of control to besolved eventually, they may find, in the end, the cost ofplugging into the Digital World too steep. GTE, for instance,relies on fiber-optic cable to deliver its services to theJakubik family. Futurists extol the virtues of fiber optics,which consists of hair-thin strands of super-clear glass thatsend messages by flashing a light on and off -- ones andzeroes -- more than a billion times a second. A single strandcan transmit 16,000 conversations at once, compared with 24conversations on copper wire, which today connects the homesof virtually all consumers to the telephone network.   The trouble with fiber? The price-tag on building anationwide network is put at anywhere from $100 billion to $1trillion.</TEXT></DOC>
