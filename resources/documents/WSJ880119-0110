The Nordic airline said it ordered nine of Boeing's long-haul widebodies and took options on an additional 15. The order, which includes spare parts and a flight simulator, is valued at more than 4 billion Swedish krona ($662.8 million), SAS said. A decision on engines for the new planes hasn't yet been announced.    The carrier said deliveries will begin in March 1989 and run through April 1990. Seven of the new planes will be the large extended-range version, able to seat 209 passengers and fly 6,900 miles nonstop, SAS said. The other two aircraft will seat 150 people and fly 7,200 miles.    Jan Carlzon, SAS's president and chief executive officer, said earlier availability of the Boeing model influenced the carrier's decision to choose the 767 over Airbus Industrie's A-340 and McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s MD-11. Mr. Carlzon added, however, that SAS &quot;would take another look at these planes as they become available, and evaluate them again in the market situation of the early 1990s.&quot;    Seattle-based Boeing was seen as the dark horse in what became a heated three-way race between the manufacturers for the SAS order. In December 1986, SAS signed a letter of intent to purchase 12 MD-11s for 10 billion Swedish krona, with a firm purchase agreement to be signed with McDonnell Douglas by the end of March 1987. The order helped the U.S. manufacturer to start production of its long-awaited MD-11 model, a derivative of the popular DC-10.    But in January 1987, Airbus made a new offer for its A-340s and SAS decided to postpone its final decision on the MD-11s. The carrier ultimately reopened its file on the Boeing aircraft and then kept all three manufacturers up in the air for the rest of the year.    A Boeing spokesman said the aircraft maker &quot;didn't make any unusual concessions&quot; to cinch the sale. &quot;We were competitive on price,&quot; the spokesman said.    In Long Beach, Calif., a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas said yesterday that SAS's needs &quot;changed pretty drastically&quot; between the time it ordered MD-11s and today. The carrier apparently decided it wanted smaller planes and earlier deliveries, the McDonnell Douglas spokesman said. The three-engined MD-11, which won't be available before 1990, will seat 260 and fly 6,800 nautical miles nonstop.    In Toulouse, France, an Airbus spokesman said SAS's decision was a disappointment, &quot;but it's not an irreversible setback.&quot; The A-340, a four-engined plane that will be available in 1993, will be able to fly 270 passengers 7,000 nautical miles nonstop.    SAS, which is owned 50% by the governments of Sweden, Norway and Denmark, said that the 767s will allow it to increase nonstop services to New York out of the three Nordic capitals, and to offer more nonstop flights to three other U.S. cities, Bangkok, Thailand, and Rio de Janeiro. </TEXT></DOC>
