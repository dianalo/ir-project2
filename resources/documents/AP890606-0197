On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for Julydelivery of West Texas intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.crude oil, dipped 6 cents to $20.46 per 42-gallon barrel followingMonday's rise of 38 cents. Prices of refined petroleum productsposted larger declines.   The crude contract held up well given the developments at theconference of ministers representing the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries, said Chris McCormack, an energy broker atDrexel Burnham Lambert Inc.   ``All the news to me seems to be bearish. The bickering amongmembers about production, quotas and allocations was a negativeinfluence on energy prices,'' said McCormack.   Negotiations among the cartel ministers meeting in Vienna boggeddown Tuesday as they tried to agree on allotting a proposedcartel-wide oil production increase among its 13 member nations.   Some members are believed to favor dividing any additionalproduction evenly but Kuwait apparently has demanded a larger sharewhile several other countries would like special treatment.   On production, the ministers are considering a proposal toincrease the cartel's output ceiling from the current 18.5 millionbarrels a day to 19.5 million in the July-December period.   The United Arab Emirates, however, favors a boost to between 20million barrels and 21 million barrels.   As the OPEC discussions were taking place, a new report wasreleased which estimated that current production by OPEC membersfar exceeds the self-imposed quota.   The International Energy Agency said OPEC nations produced oilat a daily rate of 21 million barrels last month, the highestamount so far this year.   Energy market analysts said the violence in China and theproblems stemming from the explosion of a natural gas pipeline inthe Soviet Union had little impact on prices Tuesday. These eventshad been among the factors responsible for Monday's gains.   The July contract for No. 2 heating oil, which rose 1.87 centsMonday, fell 0.91 cent to 51.00 cents a gallon on the New YorkMercantile Exchange. The contract for July delivery of unleadedgasoline settled at 64.94 cents a gallon, off 0.86 cent, almosterasing Monday's increase of 0.95 cent.</TEXT></DOC>
