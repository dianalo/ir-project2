ADS System500 telemetry processor before it arrives at the Concurrent 6600.andM;An expert systems office at Johnson Space Center is working on better ways tohandle the volumes of data that flow in during a mission.andP;  Officials want toimprove flight decisions and safety, and to have fewer people sorting andevaluating data.andP;  For each person at a workstation in the main MissionControl room, there are support people elsewhere watching the same displays.andM;Debra Borski, a flight controller, has written expert systems software tohelp the data communications officer who monitors shuttle on-board recorders.andO;Borski's system, which should become operational in a few months, willhighlight a problem before a controller might see it in the raw data.andM;Real-time animation is another initiative.andP;  While the shuttle Columbia wasorbiting in June, a high-resolution display showed its precise attitude andposition on a three-dimensional global presentation.andP;  The display also showedthe same horizon the astronauts would see, as well as the ground stationswithin communication range.andM;At the Shuttle Mission Training Facility, three computer simulators work upto 16 hours a day.andP;  A motion simulator trains the crews for launches andlandings, while a fixed-base simulator trains them for tasks in orbit, and anavigation simulator tests guidance and navigation systems.andM;So much computing goes into these simulations that it takes twosupercomputers, an Alliant Computer Systems Corp. VFX/80 and an FX/80, justto track what is going on and verify that simulations are accurate.andP;  With 10gigabytes of storage and 3-D graphics displays, the Unix-based supercomputersdeliver up to 15,000 parameters from the simulators every 40 milliseconds.andM;The Information Systems Directorate (ISD) handles all networks on site, allcomputing equipment in the science and engineering directorates, andthousands of desktop workstations -- roughly 60 percent of the space center'scomputing power.andM;ISD has gathered its mainframes into one building and is moving to lights-outoperation, with one person controlling up to 10 mainframes from a centralarea.andP;  Clyde Waters, deputy chief of the Information Technology Division,supervised the move of ISD systems into the building, doing it all onweekends with no disruption of regular service.andM;The center, which spends about one-fourth of NASA's budget, has 3,700 federalemployees and nearly 10,000 contractor employees.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
