The decision to hold general elections in April follows fourrounds of talks between President Christos Sartzetakis andconservative, socialist and Communist leaders.   Mitsotakis said the interim administration will be headed by arespected former Bank of Greece governor, Xenophon Zolotas, who isnot a member of Parliament.   The government will include members of all parties and alsonon-political personalities, Mitsotakis said. He added that thedetails of the Cabinet's make-up still have to be decided.   He said the administration will tackle pressing economicproblems and negotiations with the United States on whether torenew an agreement for their bases in Greece.   Mitsotakis heads the New Democracy party, which in the Nov. 5elections came just short of winning the parliamentary majorityneeded to form a government alone.   He has since failed to find a coalition partner in eitherAndreas Papandreou, the former Socialist premier, or Communistleader Harilaos Florakis.   In the balloting, New Democracy took 148 seats in the 300-memberParliament. Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement won 128 andthe Communist coalition garnered 21.   On June 18, elections also failed to produce a winner. Aconservative-communist government led the country until theNovember elections.   The talks between the party leaders had been deadlocked untiltoday over a demand by former socialist Premier Andreas Papandreouthat the electoral system be changed before his PanhellenicSocialist Movement supported any government.   His proposed change to simple proportional representation wouldhave made it even harder for any party to win a majority in the300-member unicameral Parliament. Under the present system, a partythat receives at least 47 percent of the vote can govern alone.   Mitsotakis rejected the condition. He said party leaders hadagreed that the April elections would be conducted with theexisting electoral system.</TEXT></DOC>
