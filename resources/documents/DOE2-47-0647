The C-60-1 fuel supply system with a vault depthdown to the 12.5 m mark was chosen. An analysis of the results (presentedin tabular form) shows that when the load is equal to its design value,the vault is resilient but if the load is increased beyond this value,inelastic deformation appears in the vault structure. At 1.4 times thedesign load, vertical and horizontal displacement in the so-called keywere 10.8 and 40 mm respectively, the relative deformation of the concretewas 112x10{sup -5} and that of the reinforcement 250x10{sup -5}. Withhorizontal and vertical load components of 720 and 360 kN, the verticaland horizontal displacement in the key were 16.2 and 65.05 mm. The crackopening in the distended zone was more than 5 mm wide. At this load,the relative deformation of the concrete was 167.5x10{sup -5} and thatof the reinforcement 437.5x10{sup -5} which is evidence of its yield.With vertical and horizontal load components of 792 and 390 kN (2.2 timesthe design load), the reinforcement bar fractured and the concrete inthe affected zone shattered.</TEXT></DOC>
