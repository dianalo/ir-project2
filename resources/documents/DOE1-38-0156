<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-38-0156 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method has been developed for establishing waste-acceptance criteriabased on quantitative performance factors that characterize the confinementcapabilities of a disposal facility for radioactive waste. The methodstarts from the basic objective of protecting public health and safetyby assuring that disposal of the waste will not result in a radiationdose to any member of the general public, in either the short or longterm, in excess of an established basic dose limit. A key aspect of themethod is the introduction of a confinement factor that characterizesthe overall confinement capability of a particular disposal facilityand can be used for quantitative performance assessments as well as forestablishing facility-specific waste-acceptance criteria. Confinementfactors enable direct and simple conversion of a basic dose limit intowaste-acceptance criteria, specified as concentration limits on radionuclidesin the waste streams. Waste-acceptance criteria can be represented visuallyas activity/time plots for various waste streams. These plots show theconcentrations of radionuclides in a waste stream as a function of timeand permit a visual, quantitative assessment of long-term performance,relative risks from different radionuclides in the waste stream, andcontributions from ingrowth. Application of the method to generic facilitydesigns provides a rational basis for a waste classification system.</TEXT></DOC>
