Even his own portrayal of his conductduring the Iran-Contra scandal is raising questions inCongress.   If Mr. Gates's confirmation hearings were to turn on hiscompetence, experience and knowledge, they would be acakewalk. Even the nominee's critics concede he is smart, akeen analyst of Soviet affairs, a skilled manager and highlyqualified on paper to operate the $30 billion, multiagencyU.S. intelligence empire.</LP><TEXT>   Yet the Gates nomination is plagued by doubts about theveracity of his claim that he didn't know, during the Reaganadministration, that profits from secret arms sales to Iranwere illegally diverted to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. Hewas deputy director of central intelligence during theperiod.   The issue of what Mr. Gates knew and did at the CentralIntelligence Agency in the 1980s doesn't end withIran-Contra. The intelligence committee staff expects toquestion him about reports by ABC News and the FinancialTimes that during the Iran-Iraq war, the agency -- and Mr.Gates personally -- winked at or actively assisted an Iraqieffort to use companies in the U.S. to smuggle out weaponstechnology -- including chemical weapons parts -- via Chileand South Africa.   The doubts about the nomination have swelled in recentdays as it has become clear that the Iran-Contra specialprosecutor probing the scandal is on the verge ofestablishing that the CIA was more deeply involved in theIranian funds diversion than it has claimed. Some members andstaff experts of the Senate Intelligence Committee, andothers in Congress, say privately that even if Mr. Gates istelling the truth when he says he was out of the loop on thediversion, that very ignorance raises questions.   Mr. Gates, by his own admission, seemed eager to avoid anyknowledge of the illegal activities. According to the 1987report of the congressional Iran-Contra committee, Mr. Gatestold investigators, &quot;We didn't want to know how the Contraswere being funded . . . we actively discouraged people fromtelling us things. We did not pursue lines of questioning.&quot;   The report goes on to say that on Oct. 1, 1986, whenCharles Allen, a subordinate, first told him of a suspicionthat funds were being diverted, Mr. Gates said his &quot;firstreaction was to tell Mr. Allen that I didn't want to hear anymore about it.&quot;   One congressional staff member, who has pored over therecord of Mr. Gates and Iran-Contra, concludes: &quot;Nobody issaying he's a bad guy, but there is a real question about hisjudgment that goes beyond his honesty. Does he have thecourage of his convictions? Is he merely a deputy, ratherthan a leader? Is he just a loyal -- too loyal -- team memberwho has blind spots?&quot;   No evidence has come to light suggesting Mr. Gates was amajor player in the Iran-Contra operations, or even provinghe knew about the diversion earlier than he says he did.What's more, Mr. Gates could well have been cut out of theloop on the operations by his secretive boss, William Casey.Several former intelligence officials say privately that CIAdirectors have gone around their deputies on occasion to dealdirectly with hand-picked underlings.   And President Bush -- himself a former CIA chief -- arguedFriday that, because of CIA secrecy, Mr. Gates wouldn'tnecessarily have known what Mr. Casey was up to. &quot;That'ssometimes the way it works in a compartmented system,&quot; hesaid, referring to a system for classifying information in&quot;compartments&quot; only a few people can use. &quot;If it'scompartmented and the director may have done somethingdifferently, maybe you don't&quot; know, the president said.   Urging the Senate to hold hearings on the nominationquickly, Mr. Bush said, &quot;This is the intelligence communityof the United States. I have nominated the best man for it,and it just distresses me to hear hypotheses raised thatthrow question on his integrity.&quot;   But for some in Congress, Mr. Gates's professed ignoranceabout Iran-Contra gives the impression of an uninformed,see-no-evil bureaucrat, not a highly competent andknowledgeable person qualified for the post.   Sen. Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat and a Gatescritic, puts it this way: &quot;One interpretation is that here heis working with Casey, the old fox. He doesn't trust him,doesn't know what's going to happen, so he protects himself .. . he kept himself distant, so he would never know.&quot; Thesenator says, &quot;It's very important to get to these issues atthe hearings, because once he's confirmed, he disappearsbehind a cloak of secrecy.&quot;   The very essence of intelligence is to learn and analyzeall the facts. But the Iran-Contra Committee's report saysthe attitude of deliberate ignorance about Iran-Contradescribed by Mr. Gates &quot;turned upside-down the CIA's missionto collect all intelligence relevant to national security.&quot;Mr. Gates's nomination will turn, in part, on just howaggressive senators think he is about that mission.</TEXT></DOC>
