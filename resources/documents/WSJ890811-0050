Bumper-to-bumper traffic grinds to a halt. Barbara Stewart, busy president of an advertising agency, is trapped in her 1988 silver Dodge Ram van. Is she frantic?    Quite the contrary. Cellular phone in hand, Ms. Stewart talks with a client 90 miles away about a new ad campaign. She hangs up, revises the ad layout, then zaps him a copy over her van's portable facsimile machine, linked to the cellular phone. During the two hours it takes her to creep from Irvine to downtown Los Angeles, the car phone rings steadily: A client calls to change the publication date of an ad; a prospective customer asks about fees; Ms. Stewart's office faxes an ad layout and a brochure for her approval.    &quot;One day, I got 20 phone calls and seven faxes,&quot; exclaims Ms. Stewart, the president of Hubbert-Stewart Advertising. &quot;I'm seriously thinking about installing another telephone in my van.&quot;    Once a high-tech plaything, the cellular telephone is fast becoming a fixture of American life. Sales agents and deal makers adore them. Lawyers and engineers relish the mobility they bestow. Hard-charging supervisors use them to keep staffs even busier. Police praise their versatility, especially for drug busts. Not since the telephone itself has an advance in phone technology promised so profound an impact on how people work and lead their lives, in sometimes unexpected and not always positive ways.    For all their advantages, cellular phones create the prospect of perpetual intrusion. They seem to be nearly everywhere now, yet they're still proliferating. Users are finding it more difficult to disconnect themselves, even briefly, from the workplace. And since these phones don't come with receptionists or secretaries, cellular calls can't be screened.    Remember when a train or plane ride was an interval of tranquility? Amtrak now has phones on trains, most airlines are putting them aboard, and there's even talk of installing cellular phones along hiking trails in forests and parks.    A manager in Denver complains that he is now on call around the clock. Recently, he was forced to lug his portable unit to his daughter's birthday party at a park. &quot;It's ridiculous,&quot; he laments. &quot;My boss would have asked me to stay home and miss her birthday if I didn't have the cellular phone.&quot;    Daniel Foxe, a management consultant in San Francisco, says a cellular phone practically ruined a recent camping trip to Yosemite National Park. He complains that a neighboring camper brought along a portable cellular telephone &quot;that rang off the wall. What's the sense of getting away?&quot; In desperation, he moved to another campsite.    Others get annoyed when they receive a call from someone in a car. &quot;It's so rude,&quot; says Richard Adams, a produce broker in New Jersey. &quot;How can they give you any attention? One buyer would hang up on me every time he came to a toll booth. You can't get any business done that way. Personally, I think he was showing off.&quot;    Nancy W. Phillips, a real estate agent in Paoli, Pa., believes &quot;it's an indication of how quickly our lives are moving. Everything is faster paced. We want our information now. I don't know how good that really is.&quot;    Still, usage of cellular phones is soaring. Since cellular phone service was first offered in 1984, the number of mobile phone customers in the U.S. has skyrocketed to 2.1 million. By the end of 1989, the number is expected to increase 57% to 3.2 million subscribers, a level experts didn't expect the industry to reach until at least 1992.    Last year, Americans spent $1.07 billion on cellular calls. This year, the volume will reach $3.2 billion, and by 1995, experts say it could climb as high as $15 billion. Some locations, such as Los Angeles and New York, can barely accommodate the heavy volume of calls, forcing many cellular companies to convert their networks to digital technology to handle the deluge of new subscribers.    &quot;It took the cellular industry four-and-a-half years to reach one million customers,&quot; says Charles Many, president of Nynex Mobile Communications Co., a unit of Nynex Corp. &quot;In contrast, it took 20 years before one million television sets were sold in the U.S. and seven years before one million VCRs were sold.&quot;    Growth potential is fueling fierce battles for cellular franchises, which the Federal Communications Commission began granting more than five years ago. Earlier this summer, McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. launched an unsolicited tender offer for LIN Broadcasting Corp. at a price per subscriber that was more than double that paid for any cellular property so far. McCaw's initial bid was $5.85 billion. LIN rejected the offer, demanding at least $6.22 billion.    BellSouth Corp. waged a hardy battle last year to acquire Mobile Communications Corp. of America's 11-city operation. First, BellSouth found itself in a bidding duel with McCaw and was forced to sweeten its $564-million offer to $710 million. Then, while waiting for court approvals, BellSouth got ambushed by Wall Street traders and institutional investors. During the year-long wait, the price of cellular phone companies nearly doubled, making the BellSouth-MCCA deal look like a giveaway. Investors sued to scrap the accord and traders began bidding up the price of MCCA.    Fueling such bids is a staggering rise in the value of cellular-phone franchises. McCaw's bid values potential customers at $275 to $300 each. A year earlier, BellSouth paid $70 for each potential customer. And three years ago, $24 a customer was considered steep when U S West Inc.'s cellular unit paid that amount for a San Diego franchise.    With the exception of LIN Broadcasting, cellular companies have yet to turn a profit, but their stock prices are skyrocketing. Since New York-based Cellular Communications Inc. went public in 1986, the company's stock price has soared 700%. Last year alone, the stock price climbed from $13.88 to $26.75, a 92.8% increase. LIN Broadcasting's stock price last year surged 63% to $71.50 and McCaw's rose 67.4% to $27.    LIN's stock currently trades at about 50 times annual earnings per share. Dennis Leibowitz, a cellular analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities, says that Wall Street is banking heavily on future growth. Adds Kenneth Leon, an analyst with Bear Stearns andamp; Co.: &quot;It's like trading in futures.&quot;    Is such growth likely? As equipment prices have plunged, the market's expansion has accelerated. Cellular phones that carried price tags of about $3,000 five or six years ago can be purchased now for as little as $300.    Industry experts believe prices will keep dropping, since strong demand has led to economies of scale for most manufacturers. Each time the cellular market doubles, incremental production costs have fallen about 20%. The Yankee Group, a Boston-based research firm, compares the cellular phone market to the video cassette recorder industry, which didn't boom until the price of the VCR dropped below $500.    These days, cellular phones are being displayed and sold right next to VCRs, stereos and television sets at such mass merchandisers as Sears, Radio Shack, K mart and Wal-Mart. &quot;I walked out of the Pep Boys (store) with a mobile telephone that was programmed and ready to go,&quot; says Bruce Rivett, an auto-repair shop owner in Philadelphia. &quot;As soon as I got in the car, I ordered a pizza and picked it up on my way home.&quot;    How soon until there's a phone in every car? Probably not until monthly service rates also decrease. A cellular call during peak hours now costs about 37 cents to 50 cents per minute. For the average subscriber, that translates into a monthly bill of about $150. And customers don't just get charged when they make a call; they also get charged when they receive one, and they must pay about 10 cents on every busy signal or unanswered call. In addition to usage charges, most cellular telephone companies also charge monthly fees that range from $39 to $145. Despite such fees, cellular phones have become important money savers, especially for small business owners who can't afford to hire a receptionist or answering service. Roger B. Styers, owner of Husky Towing andamp; Auto Recovery in Clinton, Md., figures his mobile phone is saving him about $100,000 a year because he doesn't need a dispatching service to answer his phone. When he's out on the road, office calls are forwarded to the cellular phone in his truck. &quot;I can tell the customer exactly where I am and how long it'll take me to get there,&quot; Mr. Styers says.    Richard Freeman, who repairs fiber optic cables, says his cellular phone allowed him to clinch a business deal on the fairway of a Savannah, Ga., golf course. William David Viss, an Arizona hay trader, buys and sells bales over his cellular phone while driving his tractor. To keep from missing customers' calls while on the trail, a small California company that leads horseback expeditions into the mountains packs a cellular phone in the saddle bags.    Real estate agents, salesmen and lawyers find similar advantages. &quot;In this business,&quot; explains Mrs. Phillips, the real estate agent, &quot;the car is also your office.&quot; When clients see a house they like, she pulls over, calls the number on the for-sale sign and usually gets an appointment to see it right away. &quot;It helps move buyers along,&quot; she says.    Jed Rakoff, a trial attorney in New York City, sits in the back seat of a careening taxi to make his morning calls. &quot;I've become such an addict,&quot; concedes Mr. Rakoff. &quot;Cellular telephones have added 40 minutes (of productivity) to my day. It's not all billable time, but it has made a difference.&quot;    In Delaware's Court of Chancery, Wall Street speculators awaiting takeover-related rulings were among the first to arm themselves with cellular units; they were so distracting their use was banned while court is in session. During the Polaroid-Shamrock case this spring, Alexander Metviner, a lawyer, bolted from the courtroom before it recessed. Chased and caught by bailiffs, Mr. Metviner first claimed his cellular phone had been hidden in bushes outside the court, then admitted he had it with him in the courtroom. He was reprimanded by Delaware's supreme court and faces contempt proceedings.    By now, cellular phones are penetrating far beyond the business world. Many people are buying the equipment for safety reasons. Ever since a stroke left Christine Lindsey crippled, the 52-year-old Florida resident has been afraid to go anywhere in her car alone for fear of getting stranded. But with the cellular telephone, &quot;I've regained my independence,&quot; says Mrs. Lindsey, who needs a cane to get around. &quot;If my car breaks down, I know I can call for help.&quot;    Carol Segal, a consultant in Detroit, says she bought a cellular phone because &quot;it's not very safe for a woman to drive alone on today's highways.&quot; Mrs. Segal's job requires substantial travel across Michigan and occasional trips to the East Coast. &quot;The cellular telephone is my security guard,&quot; she says. But she also admits that the phone helps kill time on long road trips. Sometimes she passes the time by chatting with her son -- in London.    Public safety officials are putting more resources into cellular phones. San Diego officials plan to build a network of cellular call boxes along the freeways to aid motorists. A regular telephone network would have involved expensive construction costs to run phone lines along the roadway, they say.    In St. Petersburg, Fla., the police department is augmenting its citizen band radio system with cellular. The citizen band radio, or CB, is open to eavesdropping, has limited coverage and broadcasts more static than cellular signals. In Union Township, N.J., police are using cellular phones to crack down on drug rings and auto thefts.    Recently, Union Township police used cellular phones to break up a group that was stealing cars from a multi-level parking lot. Police Chief James Truhe says an officer sat on the roof, waited for the break and then alerted officers outside the lot. &quot;Before we were using the (CB) radio and the perpetrators would listen in. They knew where we were,&quot; the chief explains.    William T. Coughlin, a Seattle computer specialist, has cellular phones in both his cars, a portable unit in his boat and is now considering buying a pocket phone for his briefcase.    &quot;If you stand still, life will pass you by,&quot; he shouts because the connection from his cellular telephone is carrying a little too much static. &quot;But this is still pretty good, considering that I'm calling you from a plane.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
