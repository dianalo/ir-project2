At least sixpeople were killed.   The blast in the seaside district of Ouzai killed four people andwounded 39, including two Syrian soldiers and two Lebanesepolicemen, police said. Two more people died and another was injuredin the gunfight.   The explosion occurred at 4:05 p.m. about 100 yards from anoffice of the Iranian-backed fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party ofGod. It was the third car bombing in Lebanon this year.   A gray Renault loaded with Hezbollah gunmen raced to the sceneafter the explosion, but dozens of Syrian soldiers and Lebanesepolicemen surrounding the site stopped the car and ordered itsoccupants out, police said.   The Syrians and Lebanese were manning a nearby Syrian militarycheckpoint.   ``When the gunmen refused to step out, troops and policemen triedto haul them out by force. One gunman fired his pistol, and ashoot-out erupted in which two gunmen were killed and a civilianpasser-by was wounded,'' said a police spokesman. He spoke oncondition of anonymity, in keeping with regulations.   Syria deployed about 2,400 troops in south Beirut last month toquell fighting between Hezbollah and the rival pro-Syrian ShiiteAmal militia for control of the area. Most of the 18 foreignerskidnapped in Lebanon are believed held in south Beirut.   One of the slain gunmen was identified as Abu Ali Assaf, aHezbollah official.   Reporters and photographers watching from a distance saw troopsand policemen beating the gunmen with rifle butts through the car'sopen windows before the shooting began.   One gunman was seen drawing a pistol and firing at the officers,who opened fire with submachine guns. Panicked onlookers fled.   The brown Datsun, loaded with 33 pounds of explosives, was parkedoutside an automobile repair shop.   The shop owner, Hussein Jammal, who was wounded in the blast,told police the young man who left the car told him he wanted itsradiator repaired and he would be back to pick it up.   ``The man walked away. Minutes afterwards, the car exploded and Isaw blood all over me. I looked around for the man, but there was notrace of him,'' Jammal said as policemen helped him into anambulance.   The wail of sirens resounded across the city as victims wererushed to hospitals. Fire engines doused two burning cars with waterhoses.   Debris from four damaged shops was quickly removed by Syriansoldiers and Lebanese policemen. So were at least six other wreckedcars.   The bombing came eight days after a car bomb detonated inChristian east Beirut's Rmaeil residential neighborhood, killing 20people and wounding 78.   That blast raised fears that Lebanon's Moslems and Christianshave launched a new round of car bombings.   The first car bomb in 1988 blew up April 23 in a packed vegetablemarket in Lebanon's predominantly Sunni Moslem port city of Tripoli,killing 69 people and wounding 111.   There was no claim of responsibility for any of the threebombings. But Tripoli leaders blamed the explosion in their city onthe Lebanese Forces Christian militia.   The Lebanese Forces command denied resonsibility. It accused theSyrian secret service of masterminding the Rmaeil car bombing.   The Times of London on Tuesday quoted Shiite and Sunni Moslemsources in Beirut as saying that the United States, Britain and WestGermany have initiated direct contacts with the Iranians in aneffort to free foreign hostages in Lebanon.   There are nine Americans held hostage in Lebanon. The hostageheld longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent forThe Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Two Beirut newspapers, An-Nahar and As-Safir, published a letterin Arabic to Anderson on Tuesday, the third birthday of his daughterSulome, whom he has never seen.   ``Her only wish is to see you and be with you,'' Sulome's mother,Madeleine, said in the letter. ``She knows that ... you want to bewith her, but that you can't do that yet.''</TEXT></DOC>
