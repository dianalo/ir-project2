Gorbachev and the thawing of the Cold War were votedthe story of the 1980s by editors and news directors of membernewspapers and broadcast stations of The Associated Press.   Other stories in the decade's top 10 were, in descending order:the AIDS epidemic, Ronald Reagan's tax-cutting presidency, the U.S.drug plague, explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, the Iranhostage crisis and other terrorist acts, the nuclear meltdown atChernobyl, China's suppression of its democracy movement, theIran-Contra affair, and continuing strife in Central America.   The 306 U.S. editors responding to the poll gave 2,593 points toGorbachev and his relaxation of the Soviet Union's iron grip inEastern Europe. The AIDS story received 1,830 points for secondplace, and the Reagan presidency 1,138 for third. A first-placevote earned a story 10 points and a 10th-place listing one point.   The stories by ranking:   1. Gorbachev assumed leadership in the Soviet Union in 1985 witha policy of reform of a faltering communist system. In a series ofstunning developments in 1989, he withdrew Soviet troops fromAfghanistan and then stood aside as mass popular movements undercutCommunist power in Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia andEast Germany. Gorbachev even gave tacit approval in November as theincarnation of the Cold War, the Berlin Wall, crumbled amid joyouscelebrations by East and West Germans.   2. AIDS _ acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ first made itsdeadly appearnce in the United States in male homosexualcommunities. It spread relentlessly among heterosexuals and drugaddicts through sexual contact and shared hypodermic needles. In anage of ``miracle'' drugs, science could not find an antidote to theplague of AIDS' lingering death.   3. Republican Reagan was elected in 1980 vowing to trim thefederal government. He cut taxes sharply and shrank social programsin a fundamental reversal of government trends. Huge defenseoutlays during his two terms, however, created enormous deficitsand more than doubled the national debt. The former film starbrought Hollywood techniques to campaigning and the White House,sent troops to the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada, named thefirst woman to the Supreme Court, softened his view of the Soviet``evil empire,'' survived an assassin's bullet and left office aspopular as when he entered it.   4. Drug addiction and the crime that comes with it rotted thecore of America's inner cities and spread across the landscape.Efforts to halt the flow of cocaine from the Andean valleys ofSouth America were only marginally successful, and some responsiblepeople debated the legalization of drugs.   5. In the 1980s, the United States launched reusable mannedspacecraft _ the shuttle. But the explosion of the shuttleChallenger, just after launch from Cape Canaveral on Jan. 28, 1986,shut down the U.S. manned space program for two years. All sevenaboard Challenger, including schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe, werekilled. A faulty seal on the rocket shell and unusually coldweather were blamed.   6. Terrorism zeroed in on American targets through the 1980s,most agonizingly in Iran, where 52 Americans _ and with them thepresidency of Jimmy Carter _ were held hostage for 444 days byfollowers of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.   7. An explosion and fire in a nuclear reactor at Chernobyl inthe Soviet Ukraine in 1986 killed at least 31 people, forced theevacuation of thousands, and spewed radioactive clouds that circledthe globe. It was a severe setback to nuclear energy.   8. Communist China liberalized its economic system through the1980s. In 1989, freedom began to blossom with the spring inBeijing, only to be brutally suppressed when Chinese troops killedhundreds, if not thousands, of protesting students around TiananmenSquare.   9. Lt. Col. Oliver North became a national figure overnight in1986 when it was learned the United States had sold arms to Iranand used some of the proceeds to supply pro-American guerrillas inNicaragua. Dramatic congressional hearings and prosecutionsattempted to learn who, including President Reagan and VicePresident George Bush, knew what and when.   10. Washington, haunted by memories of Vietnam, walked atightrope all decade long through civil wars in El Salvador andNicaragua. Efforts to support democratic government in El Salvadorwere embarrassed by right-wing death squads within the military. Inleftist Nicaragua, U.S. assistance for the Contra guerrillas wounddown as President Bush succeeded Reagan, who had called the Contrasthe moral equivalent of the Founding Fathers.   Among other stories receiving votes were the continuingpolitical and legal showdown over abortion, the Armenian earthquakeof 1988, the rise of democratic movements in the Third World, suchas Corazon Aquino's in the Philippines, the 1987 free fall of thestock market, the continuing U.S. trade deficit, and scandals inthe TV ministries of Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart.   Further down the list: concern for the world environment, thehomeless on American streets, the deaths of 270 people in theexplosion of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, the deathsof more than 3,000 in the Union Carbide gas leak at Bhopal, India,the earthquakes in Mexico City and San Francisco, the eruption ofthe Mount St. Helens volcano, Hurricane Hugo, continuing troublesin the Mideast, Pope John Paul II wounded in an assassinationattempt, takeover fever in the U.S. business world, change in SouthAfrica, the assassination of India's Indira Gandhi.   In a separate AP poll of news editors in 44 other countries,based on a different ballot, Gorbachev's rise and the changes inEastern Europe were voted the Nos. 1 and 2 stories of the 1980s,followed by: AIDS, China, Chernobyl, environmental problems,Poland, Afghanistan, U.S.-Soviet relations, and Mideast peaceefforts.   Those results were based on 121 ballots from newspaper, radio,television and news agency editors on six continents.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions Dec. 16-17 and Thereafter</NOTE></DOC>
