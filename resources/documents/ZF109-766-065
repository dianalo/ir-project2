Riggs,Franklin E. Darden, Jr., and Adam Grant, EFF News takes objection to pointspresented by the prosecution in its sentencing memorandum.andP;  The analysisconcludes with the statement &quot;EFF does not support the proposition thatcomputer intrusion and long-distance theft should go unpunished.andP;  But we findhighly disturbing the misrepresentations of facts in the prosecutors'sentencing memorandum as they seek disproportionate sentences for Riggs,Darden, and Grant--stiff sentences that supposedly will &quot;send a message&quot; tothe hackers and crackers.andP;  The message this memorandum really sends is thatthe government's presentation of the facts of this case has been heavilybiased by its eagerness to appear to be deterring future computer crime.&quot;andM;The initial issue also contains an article by Mitch Kapor in which heattempts to correct a perception by some that EFF has as a purpose thedefense of &quot;people's right to break into computer systems.&quot; Kapor refutesthis saying, &quot;I regard unauthorized entry into computer systems as wrong anddeserving of punishment.andP;  People who break into computer systems and causeharm should be held accountable for their actions.andP;  We need to makeappropriate distinctions in the legal code among various forms of computercrime based on such factors as intent and the degree of actual damage.andP;  Infact, the EFF has drafted a bill that has the backing of the Governor andAttorney General of Massachusetts and that embodies these principles.&quot;andM;EFF News may be read online through USENET in the moderated newsgroupcomp.org.eff.news.andP;  Additionally, unmoderated discussion of topics discussedin EFF News will be found in comp.org.eff.talk, also on USENET.andP;  MichaelGodwin, EFF News editor, told Newsbytes that EFF News will be published&quot;every few weeks.&quot;andM;Godwin said the newsletter's purpose is to reach those interested, &quot;and toprovide a good electronic forum for discussion of these issues on the Net.&quot;andO;Godwin also told Newsbytes that EFF plans to begin production of a printednewsletter in 1991.andP;  Godwin said that the printed newsletter will be designedfor that medium and will not be merely a printed version of EFF News, &quot;Wewill try to maximize the unique features of the particular media used foreach of our publications.&quot;andM;(Barbara E.
