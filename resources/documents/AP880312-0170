ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson easily won the Democratic precinct caucusesSaturday in his native South Carolina, while Sen. Bob Dole went onIllinois television for a half-hour plea for Republican votes in astate where he said he is the underdog.   Jackson took a commanding lead in the caucuses and maintained abetter than 2-1 margin over the uncommitted, who represented thesecond-largest bloc of delegates being elected to countyconventions in South Carolina.   With 78 percent of the precincts reporting, Jackson was winning53 percent of the delegates to the county conventions, while theuncommitted trailed with 20 percent. Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore wasin third place with 19 percent and other candidates were far behind.   Dole, who spoke while standing before a portrait of AbrahamLincoln on the site where Lincoln and Stephen Douglas held one oftheir famous debates, told Illinois voters, ``I know I'm theunderdog in this race.   ``The issues are more important than the odds,'' Dole said. ``Ididn't expect this job to be handed to me in the first place.''   The Kansas senator, who earlier acknowledged that hispresidential campaign is ``hanging by our fingernails,'' invested$100,000 in the broadcast in an attempt to stop the momentum of GOPfront-runner, Vice President George Bush.   A Chicago Tribune poll published in Sunday editions said Bushwas far ahead of Dole while homestate Sen. Paul Simon was leadingthe Democratic field, followed closely by Jackson.   The newspaper also endorsed Gore in the Democratic contest,passing over native Simon and Jackson, who has made Illinois hisadoptive home state.   ``I dare George Bush to debate Bob Dole,'' Dole told a newsconference. In originating his broadcast from Knox College inGalesburg, he had picked the time and site to conform to Bush'sappearance at the same location, he said.   Gore, whose success in Southern primaries on March 8 catapultedhim into contention in the Democratic race, was counting on anotherboost from South Carolina.   ``We have worked very hard in this state and I think we have anopportunity to extremely well here,'' Gore said during anappearance in Columbia, S.C.   But favored to get a majority of the 44 delegates at stake inSouth Carolina was Jackson, a native of Greenville.   Jackson trailed Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis by 58 in the latestAssociated Press delegate count. Strong showings in South Carolina,where he was born, and Illinois, which he now calls home, couldpropel Jackson into the delegate lead in the Democratic race.   Appearing at a meeting of the South Carolina EducationAssociation, Jackson said, ``I'm delighted to be home again. Youtaught me. You can have somebody in the White House that youtaught.''   Rival Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri has the support offormer Govs. Robert McNair and Richard Riley, and is a strongbacker of legislation to limit textile imports, an important issuein South Carolina.   Gore said he too supported the legislation.   Bush crushed his Republican opponents in the South Carolina GOPprimary last Saturday.   Simon was banking on Illinois voters in Tuesday's primary togive their home state senator enough support to keep him in therace.   Dukakis, Jackson and Gephardt made forays Saturday intoMichigan, where Democrats hold caucuses March 26.   Jackson addressed the graduation at Michigan State Unversity,recalling the tumult of the civil rights movement and calling ongraduates to work for more than material wants.   ``A generation of young Americans died, sacrificed to keepAmerica better and make America strong,'' he said. ``Yourgeneration must resist the dangerous trend of surrendering to thewar of the opiate and the war of selfishness and the war of conceitand use your strength to take the torch another lap in this greatstruggle.''   Dukakis visited the 250-worker Olofsson Corp. plant, which makesexotic, computer-controlled machines, and said the United Statesneeds to re-invest in its industrial base.   Dukakis, seeking Michigan union support against stiffcompetition from Gephardt and Jackson, said he plans to target hismessage to working people, teachers, homemakers and professionals.   In Illinois Dukakis began airing a new commercial that appearedto be a veiled attack on Simon who has been saying he thought theDemocratic nominee would be chosen at a brokered convention.   The ad did not name Simon, but said some people want to returnto ``the days when you didn't really pick the presidential nominee.They say you must turn over the power to them to use at a brokeredconvention ... On Tuesday you can pick the next president. MikeDukakis is running for president in every state in America.''   A Washington Post-ABC News poll published Sunday showed Simonsupported by 39 percent of the 540 likely Democratic votersinterviewed on Thursday and Friday. Jackson had 32 percent in thepoll, followed by Dukakis with 15 percent, Gephardt with 5 percentand Gore with 3 percent. The poll has a margin of error of plus orminus 7 percentage points.   After campaigning in the city's ``Greektown'' region on Fridaynight, Dukakis stopped Saturday at an Italian bakery on the city'swest side to help bake bread. He offered a modest goal for Illinois.   ``If we can get some share of the delegates, I think it would begreat,'' he said.   Bush has repeatedly rejected Dole's debate challenges.   ``That ploy has been used before,'' he said. ``Debates are crueland unusual punishment. We've already had seven of them.''   Republican candidate Pat Robertson also was in Illinois andinsisted he did not need a victory in the state to remain the race.   ``It looks strong for me in the West,'' he said. If he loses thefight for the GOP nomination, said Robertson ``I'll dust myself offand be right back in it in 1992.''   In the GOP race, Bush has 705 delegates, while Dole was adistant second with 163. Robertson has 17.   Meanwhile, a Newsweek poll released Saturday showed that Bushwould beat Dukakis, Gore or Jackson if the presidential electionwere held today. The telephone survey of 755 voters Thursday andFriday had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.The poll also indicated that Dukakis would beat Dole, but only by 1percentage point _ within the survey's margin of error. Dole wouldbeat either Gore or Jackson, according to the survey.</TEXT></DOC>
