The scientists, in an article to be published today in thejournal Science, said they cloned the human gene responsiblefor producing a receptor for human tumornecrosis factor, aparticularly toxic immune-system hormone that is overproducedin certain disorders. Cloning the gene will enable scientiststo produce synthetic copies of the receptor to help shut offoveractive immune responses.</LP><TEXT>   Cachexia is a condition that affects cancer and traumapatients, rendering the body incapable of processingnutrients, while septic shock results from severe bacterialinfections commonly picked up in hospitals.   The biotechnology company said the development was thefifth so-called cytokine receptor that it has cloned.Cytokines are immune-system hormones that regulate whiteblood cells.</TEXT></DOC>
