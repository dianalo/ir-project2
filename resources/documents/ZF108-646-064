 Geometry from oneorthographic view can be projected into another view, and geometry from twoviews can be projected into a third view to form an isometric or true view.andO;The package supports a wide range of dimensioning types and tolerancingstyles including symbols for Geometric Tolerancing.andP;  A bi-directional datatransfer capability enables customers to exchange drawings and models, andInteractive Design is closely coupled with Cadam's geometric modelingpackage, Professional Cadam Interactive Solids Design.andP;  Version 3 isavailable June 29.andM;Cadam Interactive Design Version 3 Release 2andM;Interactive Design Version 3 Release 2 is an enhanced version of InteractiveDesign Version 3 Release 1.andP;  It offers a multiport window manager andoptional display of side bar function key switches.andP;  Like Design Version 3,geometry from one orthographic view can be projected into another view, andgeometry from two views can be projected into a third to form an isometric ortrue view.andP;  A bi-directional data transfer capability enables the exchange ofdrawings and models with host Cadam.andP;  Functions include analysis of sectionproperties; user profile definitions, model size, and data transfercompatibility; new visualisation aids including sidebar function keys;transparent file storage; and the ability to integrate the product withadvanced engineering models from Professional Cadam Interactive Solids Designand Professional Cadam 3D Surface Design.andP;  Version 3 Release 2 is to be madeavailable sometime during December 1990.andM;Cadam 3D Surface Design Version 3  Release 1andM;3D Surface Design Version 3 Release 1 provides geometric modelling tools thatenable engineers and designers to create, modify, and analyse designsinvolving three-dimensional wireframe and surface geometry.andP;  The techniquesfor defining and modifying these surfaces include trimming, offsetting,blending, and filleting.andP;  The construction techniques associated with the 3Dwireframe entities include offsetting, joining, splitting, relimiting, andextrapolating.andP;  Underlying mathematical formulation and resulting entitiesare based upon non-uniform rational B-splines, an emerging standard in thecomputer aided design and manufacturing industries.andP;  Professional Cadam 3DSurface Design provides a user interface which is a three-dimensionalextension to the Professional Cadam Interactive Design.andP;  It includesoff-plane construction techniques, multiple co-ordinate systems, and severalsimultaneous and independent geometric viewports.andP;  Surface Design is fullyintegrated with Professional Cadam Interactive Design, the program for 2.5dimensional design and drafting.andP;  It generates views for producing annotatedengineering drawings, and allows 2.5 dimensional geometry from existingmodels to be generated into three-dimensional geometry, for three-dimensionalmodeling.andP;  3D Surface Design Version 3 Release 1, which may be operated underthe control of Resource Licence Manager, is available in the US from December31, 1990.andM;Cadam Manufacturing System Version 3andM;Manufacturing System Version 3 Release 1 establishes Cadam's framework forgraphical numerical control part programming on the RS/6000 Unix machine.andP;  Itis fully integrated with Professional Cadam Interactive Design, and enablesusers to simulate the cutter motion of their part programs.andP;  Operators maychoose from several options for controlling the range of motion and displaycharacteristics of the graphical replay.andP;  These functions requireProfessional Cadam Machining Center.andP;  Professional Cadam Manufacturing Systemis a prerequisite for Machining Center applications.andP;  These applicationsallow users to develop, verify, and edit part programs, and IBM says this isan alternative to language-based systems.andP;  It's out December 31, 1990.andM;Professional Cadam Machining Center Version 3andM;Release 1 Professional CadamandM;Machining Center Version 3 Release 1 enables numerical control partprogrammers and manufacturing engineers to develop part programs in amulti-axis milling environment, with up to four-axis tool control andfive-axis positioning.andP;  It provides contour milling of sequential and chainedboundaries, pocket milling with island avoidance, and auxiliary-functioncommand programming.andP;  With its prerequisite, Professional Cadam ManufacturingSystem, Professional Cadam Machining Center provides cutter path optimizationand precise simulation of machining operations.andP;  The Machining Center isintegrated with Interactive Design, so as to enable the user to access acommon geometric database, and perform common geometric construction andediting functions.andP;  It provides a user interface that creates pop-up panelsand windows to streamline data entry.andP;  Version 3 Release 1 may be operatedunder the control of IBM Resource Licence Manager and is available fromDecember 31, 1990 in the US.andM;Solids Design Release 2 3D-CapacityandM;The Interactive Solids Design Version 3 Release 2 product is said to offer ahigh level of integration with the new Three Dimensional Surface Designproduct.andP;  The three-dimensional wireframe construction and editing isidentical between the two products, and wireframes developed in eitherpackage may be transferred to the other.andP;  Surfaces or faces that make up asolid model may be transferred to the Professional Cadam 3D Surface Designproduct.andP;  Once these surfaces are brought into the three dimensional SurfaceDesign, they may be manipulated, placed in archive, or passed on for input tomanufacturing departments.andP;  Physical plastic prototypes can be generateddirectly from the solids geometry via a push-button interface tostereolithography machines which allows users to build prototypes of models.andO;Like Release 1, Release 2 enables engineers to create three-dimensional solidmodels that may be used to generate hidden line removed views and shadedrenderings.andP;  Clearances and interferences between objects in an assembly maybe determined, and the user can produce the required views of the solid modelfor engineering documentation, including orthographic, isometric, exploded,and hidden line removed.andP;  Release 2, which may be operated under the controlof Resource Licence Manager, is available December 31, 1990.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
