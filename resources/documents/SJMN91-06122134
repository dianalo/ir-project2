That's probably why the 1962 remake of &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; was aflop. The Oscar-winning 1935 original was a great popular hit andunforgettable. After Clark Gable and Charles Laughton, who needed MarlonBrando and Trevor Howard in the same roles? It also was still playing on TV in1962, so practically everybody had seen it.;    But the rules are different inTV, which remakes classic movies every year. This season the crop has included&quot;This Gun for Hire,&quot; &quot;Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; and &quot;Shadow of aDoubt.&quot; Another is coming up this weekend: ABC's &quot;Night of the Hunter&quot; withRichard Chamberlain in the role Robert Mitchum played in the 1955 original.;   Television movies shoot for the largest possible audience on a single nightbecause they measure success in terms of ratings points, not tickets sold.That's why a movie title people are familiar with, starring a familiar TVface, generally will do better than an original starring a nobody.;    Thenetworks also are shooting for a younger audience, which means the viewersthey're after might have heard of the original movie but probably haven't seenit.;    ABC is extra lucky with &quot;Night of the Hunter,&quot; because hardly anyonesaw it when it first came out 36 years ago. Another plus: It can be sold as aheart-stopping thriller, a genre that always does well on the tube.;    Still,the die-hard movie buffs who either hailed the original as a classic in 1955or discovered it at a college repertory screening a decade or so laterprobably aren't going to like what ABC has done with one of their favorites.;   First, a few words about the original: It was made at RKO in the waning daysof that studio, under its reclusive owner, Howard Hughes. It brought togethera weird assortment of talents, none of them Grade-A box-office names at thetime; so it shouldn't have surprised anybody that &quot;Night of the Hunter&quot; was afinancial dud.;    Producer Paul Gregory was mainly known for stageproductions, and the director, Oscar-winning actor Laughton, had neverdirected a movie before. (They had collaborated on the 1954 Broadway hit &quot;TheCaine Mutiny Court-Martial,&quot; which Laughton also directed.);    The screenplaywas written by the legendary James Agee, a film critic who had recently becomea screenwriter with extraordinary success (&quot;The African Queen,&quot; 1951). It wasto be his final work for the screen. He died in 1955.;    Gregory, Laughtonand Agee wanted to film &quot;Night of the Hunter,&quot; a peculiar neo-Gothicpsychological novel by Davis Grubb about a phony preacher who planned to marrya widowed mother of two kids because he believed her late husband had hiddenthe loot from a robbery at their home. He wound up terrorizing the family andchasing the children across a Depression-era countryside teeming with homelessorphans.;    Laughton saw a parallel between this story and the classic silentfilms of D.W. Griffith, particularly &quot;Orphans of the Storm&quot; and &quot;Way DownEast.&quot; He decided to include many touches of Griffith's style as an homage tothe great director, and he even cast Lillian Gish (the heroine of those twoGriffith classics) as the hardy farm woman who seeks to defend the childrenagainst the crazy preacher.;    As the preacher, he cast one of RKO's contractplayers, Robert Mitchum, whose leading-man roles were then in jeopardy becauseof the &quot;bad boy&quot; reputation he'd received from a heavily publicized marijuanabust. As the mother, he went with Shelley Winters, whose career had beensliding toward the low-rent district since her peak in 1951's &quot;A Place in theSun.&quot;;    The result was a film of great lyrical beauty and terrifying images.As the psychotic preacher, who had the words &quot;love&quot; and &quot;hate&quot; tattooed on thefingers of each hand, Mitchum earned the best reviews of his career to dateand was resurrected as a hot commodity. Winters' whiny, strident widow rolepropelled her into the first ranks of character actors. She went on to win twoOscars in the next 10 years.;    So here's what ABC has done with the remake:taken out all the 1930s period flavor, eliminated almost all the river chase,dumped the Lillian Gish character and scratched the original's most stunningimage -- the underwater shot of Winters' corpse, her long hair rising on thecurrent, sitting in her jalopy on the river bottom.;    But those who knowfrom nothing about the original do have some worthwhile compensation: a vivid,shocking performance by former pretty boy Chamberlain as Preacher; a much moresympathetic portrayal of the widow by Diana Scarwid, and a rather flamboyantfarewell for the Preacher that's much more conclusive than Mitchum's fadeoutin 1955.;    It's not a bad movie, but it's nothing special. Yet even if theABC movie comes in last in the ratings Sunday night, it will be seen by morepeople than saw the original classic in 1955. However, I doubt if many of themwill still be talking about this version 36 years later.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Ron Miller column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910501  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  936  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday May 1, 199100122134,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
