A number of programmes supported by the EC are mentioned, wheremoney is granted for projects within the energy sector. That is the Valorenprogramme, which is directed towards the energy sector and the EuropeanFund for Regional Development (EFRU) including integrated Mediterreneanprogrammes. The report is made in Denmark as desk research with the limitationsthat makes. Italy is very dependent on imported oil, their productionof electricity is primarily based on oil. The energy planning aims atreducing the denpence of imported fuel and spreading the comsumptionon several energy sources. Coal is to play a more prominent role in thesupply, since it is planned to double the consumption from 1985 to 1995.It was planned that nuclear power was to be more important, but a popularvote said no. The use of internal energy sources will get a higher priority- that is hydroelectric power, geothermal energy, lignite, a small oiland gas production, and renewable energy sources like solar energy, windenergy and biomass. There should be possibilities for Danish export oftechnology in renewable energy, which is ahead of the Italian. The countryitself has great knowhow within the fields of traditional energy technology,geothermal energy, nuclear power and solar energy. The EC has grantedlarge sums of money for the development in Southern Italy, especiallythe Valoren programme. (SM).</TEXT></DOC>
