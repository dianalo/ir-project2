<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-14-1193 </DOCNO><TEXT>An analytical investigation of the closed-orbit distortions due to groundwaves has been made for a model periodic FODO lattice. The response ofthe closed orbit to a single wave and the rms response to an ensembleof uncorrelated waves are expressed as a function of C/{lambda} (ringcircumference /wavelength). It is found that transverse focusing (representedby the tune Q) and superperiodic lattice geometry (represented by thenumber of FODO cells N) can resonantly amplify the closed-orbit responseto certain frequencies. As a consequence, as C/{lambda} increases throughsome values mN+-Q (m positive integer), the response function is expectedto show a steplike behavior followed by a slow fall off. The resultsare compared with models that have both continuous focusing and uncorrelatedquadrupole motion. Numerical examples are presented. (author) 5 refs.,5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
