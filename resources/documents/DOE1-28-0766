The complaints may occur particularly during hot weather. Inlaboratory experiments moist mineral wool produced the same unpleasantodor at 50{sup 0}C. In samples from the air over the moist wool higheraliphatic aldehydes, ketones and aromatic aldehydes were detected. Inair samples collected in rooms of buildings where complaints about odorhad been made higher aliphatic aldehydes (n-hexanal-n-decanal) were detected,with concentrations between 1 and 50 {mu}g m {sup -3} for each of thesealdehydes. The penetration of moisture into mineral wool used for thermalinsulation should be thus avoided.</TEXT></DOC>
