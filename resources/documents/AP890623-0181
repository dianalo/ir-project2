Chris George, co-director of the U.S.-based Save the ChildrenFederation, said he was treated well during his 30 hours incaptivity. George, 35, of Montclair, N.J., walked into the MarneHouse hotel in Gaza City about 6 p.m. (11 a.m. EDT).   ``They were nice to me,'' he said. ``I practiced my Arabic duringthis period, I ate my food, fish.''   Later, speaking to journalists outside his home in the West Banktown of Ramallah, he said: ``When I asked my kidnappers, `Why me?'they said, `Because you are a well-known and important American.'''   He said he knew one of his kidnappers and identified him asMohammed Abu Nasr, who signed the letter George was asked to relayto Bush.   Nasr is believed to be a Palestinian released from an Israelijail in a 1985 prisoner swap. Palestinians in Gaza say he is notknown to be affiliated with any political faction.   The affiliation of the abductors remained unknown. The Israeliarmy blamed ``terrorists linked to the PLO.'' The PalestineLiberation Organization denied involvement.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said a note inArabic attributed the incident to the Palestinian Popular Army,about which the United States has no information.   In the 13-page letter to Bush, the captors said they kidnappedGeorge to draw world attention, particularly American, toPalestinians' plight.   ``I appeal to you in my name and the name of my comrades and allmy comrades in jail and all Palestinians to do your best to dealseriously and effectively with the Palestinian cause.   ``Why don't you do your duty and receive the head of our state,Mr. Yasser Arafat, in your office?'' the letter said.   U.S. Embassy spokesman Len Lefko said he was not aware of anyconditions for George's release.   George was seized about 11:30 a.m. Thursday when he was luredfrom his Gaza City office. He was freed at a U.N. hostel on GazaCity beach, then taken to the Marne House by U.S. Embassy officials.   Ann Nixon, co-director of Save the Children in the occupiedterritories, said George immediately called his wife, ElizabethWebb. The couple have two daughters.   ``He said he was very well treated and thought his familyprobably suffered more than he did,'' Ms. Nixon said.   George was the first foreigner kidnapped since Israel capturedthe Gaza Strip and West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war.   The territories have been torn by a Palestinian revolt againstIsraeli rule for the past 18 months, and more than 520 Palestinianshave been killed.   During the uprising, the PLO-backed underground has maintained apolicy exempting foreigners from attacks.   In Tunis, PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdul-Rahman denounced theabduction. He said earlier that the PLO was ``making the greatesteffort'' to secure George's release.   Arab reports said at least two handwritten communiques fromGeorge were passed to the Red Cross during his captivity, outliningdemands for the release of Palestinian prisoners.   The reports said George wrote that he was taken by five men armedwith a machine gun and grenades. Israeli officials said he may haveknown the man who lured him from his office.   A Palestinian journalist shown one of George's letters said itwas written in English and addressed to U.S. Ambassador WilliamBrown and Bush.   In the letter, George said his captors were demanding Israelrelease seven senior Palestinian activists, including Sheikh AhmedYassin, spiritual leader of the Hamas fundamentalist movement, andthree members of PLO factions.   George is fluent in Arabic and has worked in the Middle East manyyears. He was with the Peace Corps in Oman more than a decade agoand worked in the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein Hilweh in Lebanonwith Save the Children before moving to Israel in January 1986.   He left Lebanon after kidnappings by Moslem radicals made itdangerous for Westerners.   The kidnapping was condemned by several Palestinian organizationsin Israel, including leaders of six Palestinian workers' and women'sgroups.   ``The ugly crime is not linked to the Palestinian people,'' theirstatement said. ``It is aimed at hurting our people, our intefadeh(uprising) and our leadership, the PLO.''</TEXT></DOC>
