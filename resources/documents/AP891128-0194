All 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries would sign the agreement at its Vienna secretariat laterin the day, ministers said, as they broke up a main bargainingsession in a hotel.   How the increase would be allocated wasn't immediately known.The cartel likely would issue a communique after the agreement wassigned.   OPEC's daily ceiling for the fourth quarter is 20.5 millionbarrels, but analysts say it is producing more than 23 millionbarrels, with Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates cheating on theirquotas.   Iranian oil minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh confirmed a deal wasreached and that the new ceiling would be 22 million barrels a day.   Venezuelan minister Celestino Armas confirmed that all themembers agreed to the pact.   Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister nodded yes when askedif the target price would be $18 a barrel, its current level.   The ministers overcame their differences on the fourth day oftheir regular winter conference to reach an agreement for the firsthalf of 1990.   They had struggled with demands from Kuwait and the United ArabEmirates for bigger portions of the production.   It was doubtful the United Arab Emirates would abide by anyquota agreed to Tuesday. It and Kuwait have been producing 2million barrels a day each, or double their current quotas.   Earlier, sources, who demanded anonymity, said the tentativeplan was for Indonesia and Venezuela to relinquish portions oftheir shares so that Kuwait could get the bigger percentage itwants.   The United Arab Emirates perhaps would be allowed to producewhat it wants, sources said. The other members would get to pumpmore oil but their shares of the total would remain the same, theysaid.   Libya and Algeria, in particular, had balked at the plan sourcessaid.   Speaking of the sources' outline, Steve Turner, an oil analystwith the London investment firm Smith New Court, said, ``I thinkit's a very weak agreement.''   Such a deal would result in OPEC allowing production of around24 million barrels a day, more than it is producing in violation ofits current ceiling.   Turner estimates demand of 21.5 million barrels a day in thefirst have of 1990.   ``So it look as though OPEC is going to be producingsubstantially in excess of the market's needs,'' Turner said. ``Inthat scenario the oil price would be under continued downwardpressure.''   Recently, oil prices have been surprisingly strong in face ofoverproduction by OPEC, and are trading at levels 50 percent abovea year ago.   North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded internationalcrude oil, was trading at a spot price of $18.25 a barrel Tuesday,down 20 cents from late Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
