It didn't happen. Panama is leftwith a wounded economy and Noriega firmly in charge.   ``Abrams misread Noriega very badly,'' says McNeil, formerambassador to Costa Rica and one of his more persistent critics.Abrams' approach regarded Panamanians as ``little brown brothers''to be pushed around with a little muscle-flexing, he says _``incredible ineptitude.''   Abrams' backers contend his hand was weakened by a campaign ofleaks from the Justice Department and the Pentagon to undercut hisgrand design. McNeil's suggestion that Noriega's abdication couldbest be achieved by a Latin American -led negotiating team isdismissed as ``balderdash'' by Hyde, one of Abrams' staunchestsupporters.   Abrams assumed his duties three years ago, determined to try toovercome what he saw as a decline in American political will andleverage in Central America. Like Reagan, he was convinced that theNicaraguan government, left unchecked, would spread its revolutionand ultimately present national security dangers to the UnitedStates.   In pursuing his objectives, Abrams was never tongue-tied inresponding to his critics. One congressman's suggestion that theadministration was unconcerned over the murder of four Americanchurchwomen in El Salvador he called ``not only false, but I wouldsay malicious and bordering on the vicious.''   He upbraided another: ``Blame America. Blame America. Neverblame the Communists.''   Talking with a reporter in his sixth-floor State Departmentoffice, Abrams insists that he doesn't seek confrontation for itsown sake.   But, he says, ``I have never understood that my function herewas to take the president's views and water them down sufficientlyso that they'd be more popular in Congress.''   He'd be delighted to solicit bipartisanship, he says, but theDemocratic Party leadership had decided, ``before I got here,''that this was impossible on Central America.   It's not just the Democrats, though. He's critical of colleaguesin the administration who, he claims, fail to toe the line insupport of Reagan's policies but tend to accommodate thepresident's ideological opponents because they have a personalagenda stretching beyond the president's tenure: Lucrative jobs inprivate business after their government service ends.   ``I don't think that is why tens of thousands of people workedtheir fingers to the bone getting Ronald Reagan elected, so thatguys like me could come to Washington and meet lots of people andget a good law firm job,'' he says.   ``We're supposed to pursue policies and if there are people inthe press or in Congress or in so-called human rights groups whodon't like it, too bad.''   The people who don't like Abrams almost succeeded in dislodginghim from his office.   ``They had a good shot in June '87,'' Abrams says. ``They almostgot me. They've only had one shot since then, in April wheneverybody was blaming me for Panama.''   June '87 refers to his testimony before the committeesinvestigating the Iran-Contra affair. In October 1986, Abrams haddenied U.S. government involvement in a Contra resupply flight thatwas shot down over Nicaragua, leading to the capture of an Americansoldier of fortune.   Abrams said later he had not been informed that the flight waspart of the Contra aid network created by Lt. Col. Oliver North,the former National Security Council aide.   In June 1987, he testified before the congressional committeesinvestigating the Iran-Contra affair and called his misstatements``completely honest and completely wrong.''   In November 1986, Abrams told the Senate Intelligence Committeethat the United States had not asked third countries for money forthe Contras. In fact, as the June hearings brought out, Abramshimself solicited a $10 million contribution from Brunei, a tiny,oil-rich sultanate in Southeast Asia.   He apologized to the committee, explaining that he had promisedBrunei confidentiality, and he admitted his handling of the matterhad been foolish.   One Democratic representative who is unmollified is GeorgeCrockett of Detroit, who heads the House Foreign AffairsSubcommittee on Inter-American Affairs. He won't allow Abrams totestify without swearing him in first, ``so we can at least gothrough the motions of trying to believe what he's testifying to.''   Wayne Smith, a former head of the U.S. diplomatic mission toCuba, calls Abrams a man ``willing to lie and misrepresent thefacts about anything.''   Robert Kagan, a former deputy to Abrams, puts such attacks downto political and ideological differences. ``The liberalintelligentsia hates Elliott Abrams because he is the mostarticulate spokesman for administration policy,'' he says. ``He isa person of unique personal strength and strength of conviction.''   Nevertheless there are some people at the White House, too, whowould like to see him replaced, Abrams believes. But enjoying thefull support of Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz, hesays he'll stay on board until the president's term is up.   ``I'm not going anywhere,'' he says.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, July 10</NOTE></DOC>
