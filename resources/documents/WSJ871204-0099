The finding is a blow to the government's efforts to restore public confidence in its integrity, which has been battered by a succession of disclosures of alleged corruption by cabinet ministers and Conservative members of Parliament.    Political analysts blame these incidents for the government's low standing in the polls. The Conservatives are currently supported by only 25% of the electorate, while the Liberal Party is backed by 40% and the socialist New Democratic Party by 33%.    The judicial inquiry, headed by Justice William Parker of the High Court of Ontario, was appointed by Mr. Mulroney following allegations by newspapers and others that Mr. Stevens had violated the government's conflict-of-interest guidelines. The accusations arose from the dealings of Mr. Stevens and his wife, Noreen, with various companies that were doing business with the Department of Regional Industrial Expansion, which Mr. Stevens headed until his resignation in May 1986.    Justice Parker said Mr. Stevens's conduct during his tenure as minister &quot;demonstrated a complete disregard for the requirements of the (government's) guidelines and code and the standard of conduct that is expected of public office holders.&quot;    Mr. Mulroney said in a statement that the government accepts Justice Parker's findings &quot;and concurs that the very high standards which Canadians have a right to expect from Ministers&quot; weren't observed in this case.    The judge didn't recommend that any action be taken against Mr. Stevens, who is 60 years old.    Mr. Stevens, who has repeatedly denied the allegations against him, said he intends to retain his seat in the House of Commons despite the judge's findings.    Several of the findings concerned Mrs. Stevens's efforts to raise funds for financially troubled family companies from enterprises that were doing business with her husband's government department.    Mrs. Stevens received a loan of 2.6 million Canadian dollars ($2 million) from Anton Czapka, a businessman associated with Magna International Inc., a Toronto-based auto parts manufacturer that received numerous grants and other assistance from Mr. Stevens's department.    Justice Parker said that from April 1985, when Mr. Stevens learned of Mrs. Stevens's negotiations with Mr. Czapka, until his resignation, all of Mr. Stevens's dealings with Magna were in &quot;real conflict of interest.&quot;    Mr. Stevens's main business holding is a controlling interest in York Centre Corp., a Toronto-based company engaged in oil and gas exploration, real estate and securities transactions.    Mr. Stevens said he may ask the Federal Court to review the findings.    The judge made several recommendations for tightening the government's conflict-of-interest code. </TEXT></DOC>
