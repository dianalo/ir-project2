<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-25-0336 </DOCNO><TEXT>A report on the time dependence of magnetic fields in the superconductingmagnets of the Fermilab Tevatron has been published. A field variationof order 1 gauss at the aperture radius is observed. Studies on bothfull sized Tevatron, dipoles and prototype magnets have been used toelucidate these effects. Explanations based on eddy currents in the coilmatrix or on flux creep in the superconducting filaments are exploredwith these tests. Measurement results and techniques for controllingthe effect based on new laboratory tests and the latest accelerator operationare presented. 9 refs., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
