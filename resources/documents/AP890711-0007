The focus will be on an assembly of nearly 30 world leaders, onspectacular parades and fireworks, and on the inauguration of a newOpera house at the Place de la Bastille, where a mob stormed thehated Bastille prison on July 14, 1789, to launch the revolution.   Among the chiefs of state on hand will be President Bush, for theannual economic summit of the world's seven largest industrialdemocracies. By chance, this year is France's turn to be host.   The result, depending on the point of view, is expected to be theCity of Light at its most enchanting _ or a security-imposedgridlock on a scale the developed world has never seen.   It will either be a fitting tribute to one of the founding eventsof the modern age, or an exercise in self-congratulation thatignores both the cruel and brutal side of the Revolution and theplight of today's poor and oppressed.   Bicentennial celebrations and commemorations have been in fullswing all year, but the big weekend gets started Thursday, whenPresident Francois Mitterrand has all his out-of-town guests _ Bushand the other leaders of the rich countries, but also the leaders ofBangladesh, Mali, India and Egypt and other countries _ over forlunch.   Later on, when the economic summit gets moving, the leaders ofthe poor and middle-income countries wind up relegated to asecond-class itinerary _ dinner with Premier Michel Rocard, and thelike _ which reportedly has even Mitterrand's Socialist supportersuneasy.   A ``counterbicentennial'' demonstration and concert last weekend,on the theme that the commemoration should have more to do with theThird World and less with solemn ceremonies and fancy dinners, drewan estimated 100,000 people to the Place de la Bastille.   Apparently Mitterrand's original plan was to mount an encounterbetween leaders representing all continents, and rich and poorcountries, but he was unable to win support for the idea from hissummit partners.   With all the dignitaries dashing about town, Paris will see itsmost stringent security ever, including a dirigible looking downfrom above, and what are expected to be epochal traffic jams.   Police say expressways and city streets will be shut withoutwarning when motorcades of the 30 leaders are about to pass. A chunkof central Paris is already a no-parking zone and will be off-limitsto ordinary vehicles for three days.   Thursday night, Bush and the other leaders get a taste of cultureat the inaugural performance in the high-tech Opera house thatMitterrand has ordered built at the Bastille, just across a busysquare from where the prison once stood.   The new building, at the gate of the newly upgraded easternsection of the city, is supposed to bring opera to the people, butnews of its construction has been overshadowed by controversy overits program.   Conductor Daniel Barenboim was fired in January over what thegovernment said were his elitist views and high salary. It tookuntil May to get a new musical director, and regular performanceswill not start until next year.   Friday is Bastille Day, featuring two severely contrastingparades on the Champs-Elysees. The traditional military display,with missiles, tanks, helicopters and fighter planes, makes itsdeafening way down the avenue in the morning.   Later that night, a much-anticipated spectacle choreographed bythe bad boy of French advertising, Jean-Paul Goude, portraying theideals of the revolution through twists on national stereotypes.   ``They are cliches, but I'm trying to be positive with thecliches,'' Goude said Monday.   The images range from Britons parading in artificial rain, toRussians dancing with a bear on ice, to Africans on live zebras tothe Florida Aandamp;M University marching band strutting backward all theway down the avenue.   ``It's Michael Jackson's Moonwalk,'' Goude said. ``I asked themif they could do the `Moonwalk' from the Etoile to Concorde and theysaid, `No problem.' Very American. They're doing a salute to JamesBrown.''   The summit itself, with chief items on the agenda expected to bethe debt crisis and global environmental action, begins Friday underthe new pyramid entrance to the Louvre museum, which is closed forthree days to give way to the leaders of France, Britain, Italy,Canada, Japan, West Germany and the United States.   Most of the meetings, however, will be in the just-finishedcube-shaped arch in the La Defense complex on the capital's westernedge.   If everyone is not exhausted by Saturday night, they are invitedto watch the city's annual fireworks display near the Eiffel Tower,wrapping up the bicentennial celebrations with some of the flash andspark that started it all in July 1789.</TEXT></DOC>
