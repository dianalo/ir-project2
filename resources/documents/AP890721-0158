Cohen told reporters a dialogue between the two sides would makeit easier for the United States to improve relations withMengistu's government.   Cohen said he himself would be traveling to Addis Ababa in thenear future to discuss improving relations, which have beenstrained since the early 1908s, when Mengistu shifted his country'salliances to the Soviet Union.   The Soviets have been pressing Mengistu to negotiate with therebels and end the costly war in an effort to cut Soviet aid toEthiopia. The Soviets have said that further military assistancewill not be forthcoming, Western diplomats have said.
