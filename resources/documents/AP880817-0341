The new computer would be based on the PC AT, which IBMabandoned as it shifted production over to its new PersonalSystem-2 line of computers, according to the trade journal PC Week.   As with Coca-Cola, IBM would be bringing back the older productbecause of customer demand. IBM would continue to sell its newPersonal System-2 line, just as Coca-Cola sells New Coke.   IBM has refused to comment on the report, and some analysts areskeptical IBM would go back to an older model of PC. Stewart Alsop,editor of P.C. Letter, said: ``It would kind of give the lie toeverything they've been saying.''   Companies such as Compaq Computer Corp. and Tandy Corp. thatcontinued to make computers based on the old IBM standard haveenjoyed booming sales.   Meanwhile, IBM's share of the personal computer market hasslipped since the April 1987 announcement of the Personal System-2line.
