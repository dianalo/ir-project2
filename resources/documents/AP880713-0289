British Aerospace had reached an agreement with the Britishgovernment to acquire its 99.8 percent stake in Rover for 150million pounds, or about $254 million at current exchange rates. Atthe same time, the government had said it would inject 800 millionpounds, or around $1.35 billion, into Rover to reduce theautomaker's debt.   But the EEC's executive Commission, which has the power to blockdeals that it considers harmful to competition in the 12-nationtrading bloc, said earlier Wednesday it approved a smaller Britishaid package of 469 million pounds.   Because some regional aid also would be allowed, the governmentsubsidy effectively would be reduced to 547 million pounds, BritishTrade Secretary Lord Young said.   British Aerospace, an aircraft manufacturer that was privatizedby the Conservative government, said it requested more time toconsider its proposed takeover in light of the Commission's orderedreduction in British aid.   British Aerospace also said that trading in its shares, whichwas halted earlier Wednesday pending the EEC announcement, wouldremain suspended.   Negotiations between the government and British Aerospace werecontinuing, he said.   Peter Sutherland, the EEC's competition commissioner, said inBrussels, Belgium, that the Commission ``came to the conclusionthat not all of the elements making up the 800 million-poundwrite-off could be considered as (Rover) debt.''   He said that allowing the British government to write off all ofRover's debt would have placed the automaker in an ``artificiallyfavorable situation vis-a-vis competitors.''   Meanwhile, Rover said it swung into profit in the first half ofits fiscal year, helped by healthy operating profit at its AustinRover car division and a strong recovery by its Land Rover unitafter a pay dispute earlier this year. The Land Rover is anall-terrain vehicle.   Rover reported after-tax profit of 5 million pounds, or about $8million, in the six months ended July 2, compared with an after-taxloss of 42 million pounds, or $71 million, in the same period ayear earlier.   Revenue rose to 1.55 billion pounds, or $2.62 billion, from 1.53billion pounds, or $2.59 billion, a year earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
