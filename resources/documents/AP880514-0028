SIMPSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SANTA CRUZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Vatican says Pope John Paul II'stour of Paraguay will proceed as planned after the country'sauthoritarian government backed off on its bid to block a papalmeeting with opposition leaders.   The Vatican had said earlier that it was ``astonished'' that thegovernment of President Alfredo Stroessner would try to alter theschedule for the pope's trip to Paraguay, the last stop on hisfour-nation, 12-day South American tour.   In Lima, Peru, meanwhile, today's stop on the papal tour, acolumn of 60 marching leftist rebels firebombed a hotel where thepapal press center is headquartered.   In Santa Cruz, a center for this nation's notorious cocainetrade, the pope on Friday issued his harshest condemnation of drugtrafficking since he began the trip May 7 in Uruguay.   At the city's municipal airport _ which U.S. drug agents say isused intensively by cocaine runners _ John Paul told about 220,000people at a Mass that the drug trade ``leads to the most terribleform of slavery and sows your soil with corruption and death.   ``There is an urgent need not only to protect youth from drugconsumption but to combat trafficking itself, which is a totallyinfamous activity,'' the pontiff said.   He challenged his audience to tackle a long list of ills thatplague Bolivia, South America's poorest country.   Also Friday, the Vatican said in a communique released inBolivia that ``The holy father's pastoral visit to Paraguay willproceed just as planned.''   Earlier this week, Stroessner's government canceled John Paul'sscheduled Tuesday meeting with the Builders of Society in Asuncion,Paraguay's capital.   About 350 intellectuals, businessmen and politicians belong tothe group, which is sponsored by the church and includesrepresentatives of unauthorized opposition parties. Paraguay hadsaid the ban was for ``security reasons.''   According to Friday's Vatican statement, the lifting of the banwas arranged at a meeting between Paraguayan governmentrepresentatives and the Vatican ambassador and local bishops.   Cancellation of the meeting would have marked the first time agovernment altered John Paul's official itinerary on the 37overseas trips he has made since becoming pope nearly 10 years ago.   Stroessner, a general and the Western Hemisphere'slongest-reigning leader, has run Paraguay since 1954.   In Lima, marching rebels, many wearing hoods and chantingrevolutionary slogans, tossed a fire bomb, threw rocks and smashedthree large front windows as they paraded in front of the HotelCrillon.   The violence came amid a wave of guerrilla activity Friday andfollowed a week-long series of rebel attacks.   Pro-Cuba guerrillas on Thursday briefly disrupted a mass at thethe Santo Toribio Seminary, where the pope is to speak thisweekend, and urged those attending to join their leftistinsurgency, church officials have said.   The same day, Maoist rebels bombed a police bus on a busydowntown street and wounded 14 policemen in one of the bloodiestattacks ever in the capital.   The hotel bomb, described as a Molotov cocktail by employees,broke a window and set an inside curtain ablaze, witnesses said.There were no injuries and the blaze was rapidly doused, policesaid.   The press center for the papal visit is headquartered on themain floor of the plush hotel.   Also Friday, leftist guerrillas bombed a bank and strafed amilitary installation with machine-gun fire from a passing car,police said. There were no injuries in either attack.</TEXT></DOC>
