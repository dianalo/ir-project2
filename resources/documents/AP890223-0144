Abrams said ``a very good argument'' could have been made fortaking either step after the U.S.-led invasion of Grenada in October1983.   Abrams, who headed the Latin American Affairs Bureau at the StateDepartment for 3{ years, outlined his views in an interview with``Policy Review,'' a magazine published by the Heritage Foundation.Abrams joined the conservative think tank after leaving governmentservice last month.   After the Grenada invasion, he said, ``the president shouldsimply have said, `Look, we have to enforce the Monroe Doctrine; wecannot have a communist government in Nicaragua,' and done whateverwe needed to do to get rid of it, including a naval blockade orpossibly even an invasion.''   Abrams said the administration made a number of other mistakes inpursuing its Nicaraguan policy but most of the blame belongs to theHouse Democratic leadership, ``which put up a fierce, and for themoment a winning, battle to hand Nicaragua over to communism.''   Although that was not their goal, Abrams said, ``that wascertainly the effect of their actions.''   Abrams was particularly critical of House Speaker Jim Wright,D-Texas, who successfully campaigned against an administrationmilitary aid request last February for the Nicaraguan Contras.   Wright ``has been one of the leaders of the left-wing caucus ofthe House Democrats and has proved to be impossible to work with,''Abrams said.   Abrams, who was interviewed by the magazine last October, saidthe new administration should seek military aid for the Contras.   ``If we abandon the Contras, then yes, absolutely, bloodshed willincrease in Central America. ... There will be a significantincrease in violence in El Salvador and Guatemala. The Sandinistaswill increase their support for subversion and for communistguerrillas in the region. When that happens, you can be sure therewill be a reaction from the military and from the right, which willproduce more bloodshed.''   Abrams said that Latin American democracies declined to supportU.S. policy in Central America out of fear of a hostile politicalreaction internally.   He quoted a South American foreign minister, whom he refused toname, as saying that if his government supported the Contras, ```Cuban President Fidel) Castro would just flip a switch and we'dhave the biggest student and labor demonstrations that you have everseen in my country.'
