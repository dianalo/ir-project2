 Suppose, for example, that you wish todisplay a document from another system, but you do not have one of theoriginal fonts.andP;  If the document includes Panose numbers as well as fontnames, you can substitute one of your fonts whose Panose number is close tothe original.andP;  This will provide the best match to the appearance of theoriginal type.andM;As we shall see, there are some limitations of the method.andP;  But it provides auseful alternative to current font-substitution schemes, such as Bitstream'sAnalogue desk accessory, which are based on font-name databases.andP;  Since namesare trademarks, font makers have to think up different names to describefaces that are functionally identical.andM;This may pass the legal test of reducing &quot;market confusion,&quot; but itexacerbates the problem of moving documents between systems.andM;How it works.andP;  The current Panose classification system measures 15properties of a typeface:andM;* Family kind--text, script, decorative, pictorial.andP;  The current Panosematching algorithm works only with Roman text faces.andP;  Adapting it tonon-Roman scripts may be possible, but that is a job for the future.andM;* Serif style--including cove, square cove, obtuse cove, square, bone,triangular and exaggerated serifs.andP;  Sans-serif categories include normal,obtuse, flared and rounded.andM;* Weight--ranging from very light through book and medium on up to heavy,black and nord.andM;* Proportion--old style, modern, expanded/condensed or monospaced.andM;* Contrast--from none to very high.andM;* Stroke variation--gradual to rapid degrees of stroke change speed.andM;* Angle of stress.andM;* Arm style--straight or non-straight arm styles.andM;* Termination type--horizontal, vertical or wedge-shaped.andM;* Letterform--normal or oblique variants of weighted, boxed, flattened,rounded and off-center.andM;* Midline--standard, high, low or constant.andM;* Apex treatment--trimmed, pointed or serifed.andM;* X-height--small, standard or large.andM;* Uppercase height--constant or ducking to accommodate diacritical marks.andM;Each of these properties can be measured in a very objective and unambiguousway.andP;  &quot;You could take a man off the street and with one day's training, hecould use this system,&quot; we were told.andP;  Between 60 and 70 measurements arerequired for each font.andM;Currently, the measurements must be made manually.andP;  Although it has notwritten code to do this, ElseWare believes that the entire classificationprocess could be done by computer.andP;  The algorithms would examine a font'soutline data, computing the curvature of arcs, identifying specific featuressuch as the narrowest point on a stem and so forth.andP;  The computer would thenmassage the statistics it had collected, pigeonholing the font according tothe properties of the Panose system.andP;  ElseWare hopes to have such a programby the fourth quarter of this year.andM;ElseWare's current Classification Metrics software accepts the measurementsthat have been gathered manually, then applies proprietary formulas andlookup tables to determine the font's ten-digit Panose number.andM;Unique ID.andP;  ElseWare claims that the Panose number for each font isreplicable.andP;  For example, given two nearly identical fonts from differentmanufacturers, the Panose mapping program produces numbers that are the sameor very close.andP;  Given fonts that are similar but not identical, the mapperproduces different numbers.andP;  The greater the difference in appearance (asmeasured by the 15 properties), the greater the difference in numbers.andM;To assure that this remains true, ElseWare intends to maintain a master listof assigned font numbers.andP;  It will also require its software licensees tosubmit their numbers to ElseWare for verification.andM;As noted above, the Panose system only applies to Roman alphabets and onlyfor text faces.andP;  It has not been extended to work with decorative fonts ornon-Roman scripts such as the ideographic Kanji script.andM;Matching algorithm.andP;  Determining the similarity or difference between twofonts is not quite as easy as subtracting their Panose numbers.andP;  The separatedigits carry different--and interrelated--weights.andP;  ElseWare's PanoseMatching Algorithm takes these variables into account and allows the user tosupply his own priorities and overrides.andM;The Panose matcher could also be used as a subsystem for a more comprehensivefont matching scheme.andP;  Panose only looks at letter shapes; it does notconsider widths or sidebearings.andP;  Clearly, to pick a font that comes closestto matching a document's overall appearance--preserving line endings, forinstance--it would have to take these other factors into account.andM;Deliverables.andP;  ElseWare is interested in licensing the Panose system to fontmakers, operating system vendors, application developers and printermanufacturers.andP;  Current products include tables of premeasured typefacenumbers, the Classification Metrics program and the Matching Algorithms,along with documents that describe the underlying classification principles.andM;Microsoft intends to include Panose ID numbers as part of the TrueType fontheader.andP;  Although no product features have been announced, this implies thatfuture Microsoft applications and operating systems will use the numbers toidentify fonts regardless of the names that vendors attach to them.andM;For readers whose interest is more academic, a book by Ben Bauermeister, theinventor of the system, describes an earlier and less objective version ofPanose.andP;  The Comparative Manual of Typography: The PANOSE System waspublished by Van Nostrand Reinhold in 1985.andP;  Recently, ElseWare took back themarketing of the book from Van Nostrand and will sell copies while supplieslast.andP;  As we go to press, the price has not been set.andM;Standards.andP;  Efforts at ISO and AFII are under way to standardize the names offonts and provide a central registry for names.andP;  These tasks will continue tobe useful.andP;  The ISO standard, for example, includes width table information,which the Panose scheme lacks.andP;  What Panose provides is a numeric system forassessing the degree of similarity between fonts with different names.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
