The Democratic presidential candidate said his proposal for aPan-American energy security alliance, in cooperation with Canadaand the Latin countries, would free the United States from relianceon the OPEC nations.   He said it could also be part of an overall cooperative strategyto help Latin countries reduce their debt so that they couldpurchase more American products, thereby reducing the U.S. deficit.   Jackson picked up the endorsement of veteran state Sen. GeneStipe, who has served in the statehouse for 40 years, and a handfulof other legislators here.   ``He is the best thing in the race,'' said Stipe, who untilrecently had supported Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.   Stipe said he now backs Jackson because ``I can see he has achance to be president. He has the momentum. After Super Tuesday,they're not going to be able to stop him.''   He predicted other white Oklahomans would also back Jackson andhelp him in the state's Super Tuesday primary.   Later, at the University of Arkansas, Jackson was endorsed byJohn J. Hooker, a former Tennnessee gubernatorial candidate whosaid he was representative of many more whites from his home statewho supported Jackson.   ``After Super Tuesday, the rebels are going to come to Jesse bythe hundreds of thousands,'' he said to cheers.   Hooker said Jackson's success in five Northern states withvoting-age populations of 1 percent or less had caught theattention of many whites who did not support Jackson in his 1984race.   In an interview later, Jackson declined to specify what hisexpectations were for Super Tuesday but expressed cautious optimismthat he would pick up significant white votes.   ``I can only say that I'm reaching out,'' he told The AssociatedPress.   Jackson said ``one can never be so certain about what's going tohappen Tuesday,'' but added: ``My sense is there's a higher comfortlevel'' among whites for his candidacy.   Jackson is trying to pull white voters into his camp, andcampaign manager Gerald Austin said Jackson's strategy is to pullin up to 10 percent of the white vote as well as his solid base ofblack support on Super Tuesday.   At the state capitol, Jackson was greeted by a standing ovationfrom a joint session of the legislature. He teased some lawmakersfor wearing campaign buttons of other presidential contenders,telling them not to support candidates that ``are not viable.''   Jackson is spending most of the pre-Super Tuesday campaign daysbouncing across what he calls ``the new South'' and its borderingstates. He is intent on making inroads in 105 congressionaldistricts where his campaign sees a chance to gain a significantpart of the 1,307 delegates up for grabs on Tuesday.   His campaign on Friday will launch a $100,000 TV campaign ineight states, one featuring endorsements by comedian Bill Cosby andother spots highlighting Jackson's accomplishments.   Jackson focuses on the new South, saying that voting rights andother freedoms have been won by blacks but economic inequityamounts to a new form of slavery.   He is trying to pull white voters into his campaign for``economic justice.''   His prospects in Oklahoma, where more than 30 banks closed lastyear, are good, according to Stipe, although Sen. Albert Gore Jr.of Tennessee and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri are also strong.</TEXT></DOC>
