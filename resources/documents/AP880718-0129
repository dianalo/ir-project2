Its military command said,however, that its soldiers would stay at the front.   The United States cautiously welcomed the move, saying it wasunsure of the intentions of Iran, which has suffered a recentseries of defeats. Iraq said its enemy made the decision for``tactical reasons'' and not out of any desire for ``real and justpeace.''   Hashemi Rafsanjani, parliament speaker and actingcommander-in-chief, said the decision was made by the 88-year-oldrevolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who had setIran's original policy of rejecting a truce.   Security Council Resolution 598 of July 20, 1987, calls for acease-fire, withdrawal of military forces to recognized borders,prisoner exchange and an investigation to determine who started thenearly 8-year-old war.   Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general, said he wasbeginning consultations with both sides and a cease-fire could takeeffect within a week.   Iraq agreed to the Security Council resolution long ago, oncondition Iran also accepted it, but until Monday the Iranians hadsaid there could be no truce until Iraq was condemned as theaggressor. The Iraqis invaded Iran in September 1980 after severalborder skirmishes.   On Sunday, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq urged Iranianleaders to accept an ``honorable'' end to the conflict.   Rafsanjani, who was promoted to military commander last monthand has set a less bellicose tone since then, said in an interviewon Iranian television Monday: ``Since the people of Iran believe inImam Khomeini's decisions and rely on him and the people in charge,we hereby announce the decision to accept U.N. Security CouncilResolution 598.   ``This decision is based on many reasons, but since ImamKhomeini is aware of many political and military secrets, he cannotgive more explanations at the moment.''   He said the decision was made ``for the benefit of the Iraniannation and there is no sign of weakness in it.''   Referring to the July 3 downing of the Iran Air jetliner by theU.S. Navy that killed 290 people, Rafsanjani said, ``We took it asa warning.''   ``Poisonous propaganda was trying to pretend that we were thewar lovers and Saddam (Hussein) was the lover of peace,'' he said.   ``Also, inside the country we have enemies who are trying tocondemn us because of not accepting the cease-fire,'' he said in arare open admission by a top official of discord inside Iran overthe war.   ``But by approving the U.N. resolution our fight has notended,'' Rafsanjani added. ``According to the imam's order, we willnot have to fight on the war fronts for the moment while we wait tosee the U.N.'s final decision.''   As Iran's acceptance of the resolution was conveyed Monday in amessage to Perez de Cuellar, a statement by Rafsanjani's newmilitary General Command said: ``We once again urge the Iranianpeople to man the war fronts to confront the enemies' aggressivenature and foil their criminal acts.''   It praised the Khomeini's ``great leadership'' and, in areference to the United States, said the ``arrogant worlds'' soughtto portray Iraq as a ``peace-loving regime'' because it hadaccepted Resolution 598.   A dispatch carried by Baghdad's official Iraqi News Agency saidthe Iranian announcement was made for ``tactical reasons'' and notfrom a desire for ``real and just peace.''   The Reagan administration said it welcomed Iran's willingness toaccept the U.N. resolution.   In Santa Barbara, Calif., President Reagan's spokesman MarlinFitzwater also said, ``I think we have to be cautious'' becauseU.S. officials are unsure what Iran's intentions are.   Fitzwater also refused to say how Iran's move would affect theAmerican military presence in the Persian Gulf, although he did saythe United States has been prepared to end tanker escorts if peacecame to the region.   A government spokesman in Syria, the only major Arab backer ofIran in the war, said his nation ``expresses its satisfaction andwelcomes the wise decision of the Iranian leadership.''   Other Arab nations reacted cautiously. In Jordan, which has beena key supporter of Iraq, Foreign Minister Taher Masri pointed outthere had been conflicting signals from Iran. The semi-officialKuwait News Agency said the Iranian move ``brings joy.''   Clovis Maksoud, the Arab League's ambassador to the UnitedNations, also welcomed the Iranian move, but noted that it was``overdue.''   Several hours after the Iranian General Command statement wasdistributed by the official Islamic Republic News Agency, Iraq saidits helicopter gunships flew 61 sirties against Iranian positionsMonday, inflicting ``losses in men and equipment.''   The Iranian message to Perez de Cuellar, released in New York,said ``Iran _ because of the importance it attaches to saving thelives of human beings and the establishment of justice and regionaland international peace and security _accepts Security CouncilResolution 598.''   Iran's military command advocated a ``new policy'' to ``exposethe aggressor'' and ``prevent the enemies of Islam ...from takingthe initiative on the international scene.''   ``The announcement of the Islamic Republic's new stands to U.N.chief Javier Perez de Cuellar is aimed at implementing this newpolicy,'' it said.   Khomeini made Rafsanjani acting commander-in-chief June 2, andRafsanjani has indicated Iran might seek a negotiated end to thewar.   Iran's military position has deteriorated. In three months, Iraqhas recaptured nearly all the territory it lost to Iran in sixyears.   Rafsanjani said in a speech June 15: ``We are not insisting ongetting our rights on the battlefield. We have defined non-militarysolutions to the war.''   Tehran's diplomatic position also has moderated since the U.S.Navy shot an Iranian airliner down July 3 in the Persian Gulf,killing all 290 people aboard. U.S. officials said the cruiser USSVincennes mistook the Airbus A300 for an Iranian F-14 fighter on anattack course.   In Baghdad, Information Minister Nassif Ltayyif Jassem expressed``reservations'' in the first official Iraqi response to Iran'sacceptance of Resolution 598.   ``The Iranian General Command's statement did not explain thereasons behind Iran's new stand in terms of a desire for a real andjust peace, but ... in terms of tactical reasons,'' he said. ``Hewho wants peace does not have to call for massing troops on thefront.''   Iraq rejected an earlier Iranian assertion that both side hadreturned to the 1980 international borders.   ``Iran is still occupying parts of Iraqi territory here andthere,'' a Defense Ministry statement said. ``It must withdraw orwe will force the Iranians to withdraw and suffer more casualties.''   In addition to territorial losses, Iran suffered a psychologicalblow in the latest round of attacks on cities from Feb. 29 to April21 of this year, in which hundreds of civilians were killed on bothsides. Up to half Tehran's 6 million people fled to the countrysideto escape Iraqi missiles.   Iraq fired nearly 200 missiles into Tehran and other citiesduring the exchange, three times the number launched by Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
