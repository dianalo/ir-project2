Frank.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Software-reliability measurement uses statistical analysis todetermine concretely the probability that a piece of software willfunction correctly.andP;  Such a measurement takes advantage of thefact that despite a vast number of possible input states forcommercial-grade software, only a small percentage of those stateswill result in error.andP;  Software-reliability measurement focusesattention on the software's use instead of its structure.andP;  Severalbasic concepts of software reliability are discussed.andP;  Applyingreliability measurement during a system test gives quantitativeinformation on the validation process.andP;  System testing certifiesthat the completed software functions close enough to itsrequirements to allow passing it to the next stage in the lifecycle.andP;  Software-reliability measurement is a new technology,sufficiently developed to be used now but with areas needingfurther development.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Software ValidationSoftware DesignError TrappingRisk AnalysisSoftware QualityReliabilitySoftware EngineeringError AnalysisPoisson DistributionQuantitative Methods.andO;Feature:   illustrationcharttable.andO;Caption:   Three useful software-reliability models.
