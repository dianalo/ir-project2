An Army spokesman said Friday that the soldier, Clyde LeeConrad, held a ``top secret'' clearance from 1978 until hisretirement in 1985.   ``Normally, a background check is done every five years,'' saidArmy spokesman Lt. Col. Greg Rixon.   But Rixon acknowledged that Conrad had never been subjected tothe usual follow-up background investigation to keep his clearance.   ``In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Defense Department fellbehind and they weren't getting them done that quickly,'' thespokesman said.   According to Rixon, Conrad was investigated and authorized for a``top secret'' clearance in March 1978 while serving his first tourwith the headquarters company of the 8th Infantry Division in WestGermany.   ``He then carried that clearance through to retirement inSeptember 1985,'' the spokesman said.   Rixon said he had no information on Conrad's specific dutieswhile with the 8th Infantry, but he stressed that a top secretsecurity clearance didn't necessarily give Conrad access toeverything marked top secret. ``Access is still based on a`need-to-know' basis,'' said Rixon.   Officials in West Germany said Conrad was in charge of guardingthe classified documents in a safe at a U.S. base.   Conrad was arrested in West Germany on Tuesday and charged with``compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an especiallygrave case,'' prosecutors said.   Officials say the ring started operating in the late 1970s,reportedly selling the Soviets secret documents about nuclearmissile bases, military pipelines and NATO troop strength.   Attributing the information to a West German newspaper that itdid not identify, ``CBS Evening News'' reported Friday that the41-year-old Conrad collected more than $1 million in the sales ofNATO secrets. CBS said investigators believed Conrad deposited themoney in numbered Swiss bank accounts but did not use his name.   CBS said investigators have uncovered evidence of aEuropean-wide operation, run from Conrad's West German home, withother agents operating out of three neutral countries. Theyincluded an agent in Switzerland who handled money, two in Swedenwho acted as couriers, and a Hungarian intelligence officer inVienna, Austria, who was said to be Conrad's controller.   In Molndal, Sweden, a district court arraigned twoHungarian-born Swedish brothers as suspected members of the spyring.   Prosecutors in Sweden and West Germany said the two men werecouriers for the network. Sandor Kercsik, 48, and Imre Kercsik, 34,confessed to working for the Hungarian intelligence service, ChiefProsecutor Sven-Olof Hakansson told reporters.   CBS added that the different ways countries handle spy casesbecame advantageous to Conrad's alleged network. In Austriaespionage is considered a crime only if it is against the Austriangovernment, and Swiss law does not allow it to lift banking secrecylaws for espionage investigations.   ``It could take months before we know the full extent of thedamage to NATO defenses,'' said a spokesman for West Germanprosecutors.   Meanwhile, Conrad's German wife, Antje, told The AssociatedPress outside the couple's home in the central German town of BadKreuznach on Friday that she had not seen him since his arrest butadded, ``I expect to see him next week.''</TEXT></DOC>
