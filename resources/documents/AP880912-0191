Thousands of Contras and their supporters streamed across theNicaraguan border in the past four months into base camps in therugged, pine-covered Honduran mountains. The Honduran governmentlooks warily at a swell of armed foreigners within its borders andworries they could become permanent refugees.   ``These guys have been fighting because the United States hasgiven them economic and military aid,'' the Honduran ForeignMinistry spokesman, Eugenio Castro, said in an interview. ``If theUnited States suddenly pulls the rug, the ethical and moralresponsibility is to take them to the United States.''   The Contra combatants put the blame for their exodus on the U.S.Congress, which shut off military aid at the end of February.Non-lethal funding approved a month later specified that thesupplies be distributed within Honduras.   ``The aid has had more negative effects to our troops than theSandinistas. The Sandinistas never forced our troops out of thecountry,'' Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros said in a telephoneinterview from his Washington home.   The Contras, backed by the United States since their formationin 1981, seek the ouster of the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. TheSandinistas came to power in a 1979 revolutionary war that desposeddictator Anastasio Somoza and gave Nicaragua a leftist government.   The rebels claim the peace process started in March with theSandinistas has failed. They profess a willingness to return tobattle but say they cannot face the Soviet-supplied Sandinista armywithout military aid.   The rebels managed last year to stalemate the seven-year waralong the nation's central spine. But they apparently lacked thepopular support base to obtain food and clothes. A fragile trucethat started with the March peace talks remains in place.   The Reagan administration favors renewed military assistance,but chances remain slim Congress will approve it during an electionyear. The United States remains vague about its plans for theContra fighters and supporters within Honduran terrtory.   Both the Contras and the Hondurans express concern about theproblems here becoming lost in other election issues. Republicanpresidential candidate George Bush favors renewed military aid,while Democratic contender Michael Dukakis opposes it.   ``We don't see it in terms of the Reagan administration,''Contra spokesman Matamoros said. ``We consider it in terms of theUnited States. We want a clear policy from the United States, whichwe have not had.''   One solution that the Foreign Ministry's Castro termed as``absolutely out of the question'' was the possibility of Hondurasallowing the Contras to obtain legal residency.   ``We cannot, we will not take them as residents,'' Castro said.``This is a poor country. We don't have enough for our own people.''   The numbers of Contras in eastern Honduras vary. InteriorMinister Enrique Ortez Colindres recently put the figure offighters at 12,000, while the rebels said there were about 10,000.The civilians were said to number 5,000 to 30,000, and OrtezColindres said as many as 300 more civilians arrive daily.   Almost 40,000 legal refugees from El Salvador, Nicaragua andGuatemala live in United Nations-run camps. Honduras estimates thatup to 200,000 others, mostly Nicaraguans, are in the countryillegally.   ``All we can do (for the Contras and supporters) is take them torefugee camps and seek help from a third country,'' Castro said.   President Jose Azcona of Honduras said recently the Contraspresent a ``serious problem.'' The armed forces expressed theirconcern.   Honduras, a staunch U.S. ally, became the cornerstone for theReagan administration's Central American policies. Tens ofthousands of American troops pass through yearly for militarymanuevers. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency ran the Contratraining and resupply programs from Honduran military bases.   Honduras, in exchange, received millions of dollars in U.S.economic and military aid, although for years the governmentofficially denied the presence of the Contras.   The issue recently was highlighted, apparently with the tacitconsent of the Hondurans, by the Contras, who ferried groups ofjournalists to the remote camps to show the plight of the fightersand the civilians.   Matamoros said the Contras seek military aid and not refuge.   ``The bottom card is not a green card,'' he said in reference tothe U.S. immigration card given to resident aliens. ``We are notbegging to get into a refugee camp or to the United States.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Tues PMs Sept. 20</NOTE></DOC>
