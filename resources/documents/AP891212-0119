More Vietnamese might be allowed into the United States if HongKong persists in deporting Vietnamese boat people, officials said.   ``The U.S. position is that involuntary repatriation isunacceptable until conditions improve in Vietnam,'' said WhiteHouse spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.   ``We continue to support the voluntary repatriation of asylumseekers as proposed in the comprehensive plan of action adopted bythe Red Cross,'' he added.   In London, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said there would be nomore flights until the House of Commons debates the issue on Dec.19.   Fifty-two Vietnamese migrants were roused from their beds bysecurity forces before dawn and put on a chartered jet to Hanoi inHong Kong's first forced repatriation of boat people.   The British colony currently houses about 57,000 Vietnamese insqualid camps. Britain contends they are not true refugees becausethey did not flee persecution but simply sought a better lifeeconomically.   Fitzwater, noting that the United States had accepted 50,000Vietnamese in the last year, cited humanitarian arguments againstforcing boat people to return against their will.   ``We recognize the large number of Vietnamese asylum-seekers inHong Kong has strained their resources. However, we believe thatthese pressures are best alleviated through the type of concertedinternational action called for by the International Red Cross,''he said.   He said U.S. position is that ``the country of first asylum hasresponsibility,'' in this case the British colony.   Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., chairman of the House RepublicanResearch Committee, called the repatriation ``totally outrageous''and urged Hong Kong and Britain to reconsider or ``face the scornof the world community.''   ``All free men should be disgusted by Hong Kong's actions,''Hunter said. ``The boat people braved stormy seas, leaky boats andpirates to escape Communist Vietnam. Now Hong Kong, one of themiracles of democracy and free enterprise, is dragging the boatpeople kicking and screaming back to Vietnam.''   At the State Department, spokesman Richard Boucher said ``theUnited States deeply regrets the forcible repatriation ofVietnamese asylum seekers from Hong Kong to Vietnam.   ``We believe that the British government should not proceedfurther with mandatory repatriation from Hong Kong. We believe thatBritish authorities should continue to grant asylum to all thosepersons from Vietnam who seek it,'' Boucher said.   He cited a June agreement to that effect reached in Geneva bythe United States, the British, Vietnam and other Southeast Asiannations.   ``While we may have differences with the British on this action,we both agree that conditions inside Vietnam are the root cause ofthe problem. We hope we can work together to deal with this,'' hesaid.   He added that the United States continues to press Vietnam for acomprehensive settlement of the Cambodian conflict that would paveway for a more normal political situation throughout the region.   An administration official, who spoke on the condition ofanonymity, said that it was likely that the United States wouldincrease the number of Vietnamese refugees it takes as a result ofHong Kong's action.   However, the official said ``there are limits.''   The official said that there is already a process under whichsome Vietnamese refugees who escaped to Hong Kong have been given asafe haven in the United States.   Since the North Vietnamese conquest of South Vietnam in 1975,the United States has accepted 930,000 immigrants from Vietnam,Laos and Cambodia, far more than any other country.</TEXT></DOC>
