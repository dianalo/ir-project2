The OCSis defined as those submerged lands on the continental margins of theUnited States which are subject to federal jurisdiction. These landslie outside the three-mile zone of coastal submerged lands which arereserved to the states. Although the specifics of federal OCS energydevelopment programs may be expected to vary over time, some form ofaccelerated development will likely remain an option. Accelerated OCSenergy development will have profound implications for coastal states.Coastal states, local governments, environmentalists, and citizen groupshave extensively criticized the Department of the Interior plans foraccelerated offshore oil exploration. The controversy over the directionof OCS leasing will continue as the program accelerates. This paper providesthe background to understanding the environmental conflict of OCS oiland gas development in the coastal zone. The reader is introduced tothe history of the continental shelf doctrine and the legal frameworkfor OCS energy development within our federal system.</TEXT></DOC>
