Among those investors scooping up SciMed shareswas Lawrence Bowman, manager of the $450 million FidelityEmerging Growth Fund of Boston. Despite the company'sannouncement that it may withdraw a popular heart catheterbecause of patent challenges, which triggered the stock'splunge, Mr. Bowman said he still expects SciMed's earnings togrow about 20% a year for the next few years-even withoutsales of that product. And despite its dive, SciMed is up79.5% this year.   Biotechnology stocks also rebounded from a slide last weektriggered by a cautious Morgan Stanley analyst.

Ms.Miller also told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report thatIcos might have a product ready for studies on humans nextyear, but she still rates the young company's shares a&quot;hold.&quot;   Other active stocks were mixed: Ryan's Family SteakHouses, the day's most active issue, edged up 1/8 to 9 1/2 onnearly 2.6 million shares.

Sun, whichunveiled products for its workstations, rose 1/4 to 30 1/4.   Bullish analysts' comments sparked a 3 3/4-point gain inNYMagic to 27 3/4 and a 2 1/8-point climb in Tellabs to 157/8. Alex. Brown andamp; Sons analyst Ira Malis upgraded hisinvestment rating on NYMagic, a New york property andcasualty insurer, to &quot;buy&quot; from &quot;hold.&quot; Among other factors,Mr. Malis cited the company's rising rates on marine andaviation insurance.
