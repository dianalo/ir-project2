In an interview, Comptroller Sean Boyd said the sale Monday to closely held Iona Corp., a Toronto developer, is expected to add more than C$7 million, or 50 cents a share, to Agnico-Eagle's first-quarter earnings next year. The transaction is due to close March 31.    Mr. Boyd said the projected real estate profit excludes C$2 million of tax credits that Agnico-Eagle could apply against earnings from the sale, which will be accounted for as regular income and not as a special gain.    Barry Landen, secretary treasurer, said Agnico-Eagle, a gold and silver producer, &quot;is considering the possibility of a special dividend&quot; after the sale closes. If approved, Mr. Boyd said, the payout would likely be about 10 cents a share.    Mr. Boyd said his 1989 profit outlook of 75 cents a share is based on an average gold price of US$425 an ounce and company output of 80,000 ounces.    For 1988, Mr. Landen said Agnico-Eagle expects a loss of about 20 cents a share, mainly as a result of production interruptions and reduced output at its Joutel, Quebec, gold division, which is expected to produce about 60,000 ounces this year, down from 74,818 ounces in 1987.    For 1987, Agnico-Eagle reported net income after special gains of C$13.9 million, or 99 cents a share, on revenue of C$51.8 million. During 1988's first half, the company had a net loss of C$1.2 million on revenue of C$22.5 million.    Regarding a recently proposed precious metals exploration venture with Hecla Mining Co., Agnico-Eagle President Paul Penna said the partners plan to form a new public company that would hold their existing propects. It would aim to raise &quot;$40 million to $50 million&quot; for future exploration and development, he said. The venture requires board approvals. </TEXT></DOC>
