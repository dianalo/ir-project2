To blame high-yield bonds forFirst Executive's demise is equivalent to blaming a homeownerwhose residence was torched by an arsonist for making a poorreal estate investment. But in this case, the firebug is thefederal government.   The current fashion for financial McCarthyism demands thisreply: The overwhelming economic evidence is that high-yieldsecurities are not now, nor have they ever been, a threat tothe solvency of insurance companies. Generally, high-yieldbonds occupy no more than 6% of insurance company investmentportfolios. Investors who lost money in the junk bond marketdid so either because they were not properly diversified, orbecause they sold, or were forced by the government to sell,at the bottom of the market. Anyone who pursued abuy-and-hold investment strategy from 1981 until 1989, wouldhave averaged a 14.2% yield in junk bonds. At their veryworst, over the past four years of declining market values,junk bond yields never fell below those of short-term U.S.Treasury bills.</LP><TEXT>   But with insurers holding more than 30% of noninvestmentgrade bonds, insurance regulatory efforts that inspirefinancial panics in the junk-bond market (like the one thatoccurred in 1989 after regulators imposed restrictions onsavings-and-loan high-yield holdings), could further weakenasset values, reduce the availability of capital, andincrease its cost to American companies.   First Executive's problems began with its success inchallenging the more established names in the insuranceindustry. With two-thirds of its $10 billion portfolio inhigh-yield securities, First Executive exploited this newfinancial tool, and was able to offer highly competitiverates and insurance products. In hindsight, Mr. Carr shouldhave known that he had to diversify his portfolio as early as1987, when political pressures heated up and companies likethe Equitable and Metropolitan Life persuaded New Yorklegislators to order insurance companies to limit theirinvestments in junk bonds to 20% of their portfolios. Onlytwo companies -- First Executive and Presidential Life --exceeded that limit.   And certainly when the federal government fined Drexel andprosecuted Michael Milken, Mr. Carr should have seen thehandwriting on the wall. By holding on to its junk bonds toolong, First Executive ended up with a portfolio filled withthe most distressed credits (25% in default, compared with ajunk bond market default rate of less than 5%).   Mr. Carr may well have feathered his nest at the expenseof others, as has been alleged. But that is precisely whathis competitors have been attempting to do. The use ofgovernment regulation to cripple competition has a long andusually unfortunate history in this country, from railroadsto telecommunications. The fate of the junk bond market isjust the latest example of this sorry practice.   Over the past three years, thrifts, insurance companiesand mutual funds -- which collectively account for roughlytwo-thirds of high-yield bond holdings -- have beenconfronted with new regulations and guidelines that forcedthem to dump or restrict their holdings. Here's a briefreview:   -- The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery andEnforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) initiated the sell-off inthe high-yield market. The 5% of savings-and-loans that held7% of the high-yield market (investments that altogethercomprised less than 1% of the total savings-and-loanportfolio) were forced to dump their holdings onto the marketall at once, because of accounting rules that requirefinancial institutions to &quot;mark to market&quot; those securitiesthey do not plan to hold to maturity.   -- The Highly Leveraged Transaction Guidelines thenfollowed. The Federal Reserve Board, the Federal DepositInsurance Corp., and the Comptroller of the Currency moved in1989 to curtail lending associated with corporaterestructurings. The guidelines they enacted defined &quot;highlyleveraged transactions&quot; as loans that doubled debt andincreased liabilities to 50% of assets, or that raisedliabilities to at least 75% of assets. By 1990, 70% ofFederal Reserve reporting banks indicated that they hadreduced lending to such &quot;highly leveraged transactions.&quot;   -- Next came regulations on insurance company holdings. Todispel mounting pressure for federal oversight of insurancecompanies, the National Association of InsuranceCommissioners, the association of state insurance regulators,in late 1989 enacted guidelines to limit life insurancecompanies' holdings of noninvestment grade securities. Newrules require insurance companies to establish costlyreserves against noninvestment grade holdings, even whenthose holdings are paying interest and principal backpromptly. Prodded by the NAIC guidelines, 13 states haveproposed caps on high-yield holdings.   -- Securities and Exchange Commission regulations set togo into effect in May will reduce the amount of lower-gradecommercial paper that money market funds may hold to 5% oftheir portfolios from 25%.   -- Pension fund regulators are also responding to themedia hysteria surrounding junk bonds. Pension funds hold 15%of all junk bonds. In New York, pension fund rules forbidstate pension funds to invest in bonds issued to financeleveraged buyouts. California announced its fund would sellits $530 million junk bond portfolio (less than 1% of thefund's holdings), even though that portfolio had experiencedfew defaults and a 13.5% return.   All of this has occurred just as the junk bond market wassuffering a painful correction -- its first in years. As aresult, thrifts, insurance companies and mutual funds weresaddled instantly with losses, creating a snowball effectthat was destined to produce casualties like First Executive.   Why are institutions made profitable by junk bonds beingtransformed into government-run basket cases? The economicorigins of the junk bond market and the political responsesto it need to be understood.   Interest rate volatility in the late 1970s caused banks towithdraw from lending to small and mid-sized noninvestmentgrade companies. New issue junk bonds appeared in the 1980sto replace the general commercial credit that was recedingfrom that sector. Over the past decade and a half, more moneywas raised in the junk bond market for nonfinancial companiesthan by the entire commercial banking sector. As this newfinancial instrument became the main source of fixed-rate,long-term business loans, substituting for an overlyrestrictive banking industry, established financialinstitutions stung by this new competition sought to reclaimtheir traditional market.   Though subordinated bank lending increased, it neverreached the levels of the high-yield market. Meanwhile, likeany successful innovation, junk bonds were taken to extremesby the late 1980s and were used to support conglomeratemergers and defensive recapitalizations thatuncharacteristically preserved the economic efficiencies theyoriginally challenged. As early as 1987 Mr. Milken was urgingcorporations to deleverage their balance sheets in order tolower capital costs, but costly debt-laden recapitalizationsand buyouts continued all the same. It was that market thatFirst Executive was trying to buy into. Two-thirds of thedistressed credits in the high-yield market were issued after1987. The 25% of First Executive's high-yield portfolio thatis in default comes from those late-issued and poorlystructured junk bonds.   The government's response to the junk bond market turned amarket correction into a regulatory rout. It dismantled thejunk bond market and led to a broader capital crunch thatcaused the present recession and could still abort anyrecovery. In the aftermath of the rout, capital flows intothe noninvestment grade sector have slowed dramatically. Newissuance in the high-yield market declined 77% last yearalone. Meanwhile, net new bank loans in the nonfinancialcorporate business sector declined from $33.1 billion in 1989to $2 billion last year.   In short, in order to save the capital and credit markets,the government has proven itself able and willing to destroythem through zealous over-regulation. History suggests howominous such over-reactions can be: Princeton's Ben Bernankehas linked the deliberate contraction of credit by largelending institutions in 1929-30 to the severity of theensuing Great Depression. Faced with relatively high costs ofcredit, small borrowers, who need it the most, could notafford it. The effects of the credit markets' failure torespond to aggregate demand were widespread, severe andprolonged.   Sixty years later, in the midst of recession and acontracting credit market, it is still important forregulators to remember the efficiencies of supply and demandin the operation of financial markets. As Merton Millerwarned in his 1990 Nobel acceptance lecture, the&quot;anti-leverage hysteria&quot; that promotes regulatory attacks onthe capital markets can over-ride the self-correctingmechanisms in the market. So far, the only success of publicpolicy in the high-yield market has been artificially torestrict access to the capital required to grow our way outof this recession.   ---   Mr. Yago, a professor of business at the State Universityof New York at Stony Brook, is the author of &quot;Junk Bonds: HowHigh-Yield Securities Restructured Corporate America,&quot;(Oxford, 1991).</TEXT></DOC>
