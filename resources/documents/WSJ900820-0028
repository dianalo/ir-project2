The three countries, after all, contain about 45%of all the earth's oil resources and account for almost 20%of all present productive capacity. Thus, on the surface,Saddam Hussein might seem as serious a threat to globaleconomic health as the Arab oil embargo of 1973 or theIranian revolution of 1979, both of which threw the Westerneconomies for a loop as they sent oil prices soaring.   But the world is better prepared this time. Theinternational oil market is more sophisticated andtransparent. It is painfully aware that prices can go down aswell as up. The industrial nations are less dependent on oilthan they were a decade ago, and oil stocks are at historichighs. Governments are doing a better job of responding tothe crisis. And most importantly, the widespread panic thatmade the 1970s crises so devastating is largely absent.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   A few simple figures show how dramatically the Westerneconomies have reduced their energy reliance since the 1970s.In the U.S., the amount of energy required to produce $1,000worth of national output dropped to 0.44 of a ton of oil in1988 from 0.55 in 1979, according to Cambridge EnergyResearch Associates. In Japan, the drop was even moredramatic, falling to 0.27 in 1988 from 0.35 in 1979. Theshift is partly due to a relative decline in heavy-industrymanufacturing in the industrialized countries, but is alsothe result of efforts to conserve fuels.                                                                                                          Moreover, the industrialized economies in the 1980ssucceeded in diversifying their sources of energy and makingtheir economies more flexible. U.S. industry can save anestimated hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil a daysimply by switching boilers to natural gas and other fuels.&quot;The impact of the current crisis on oil prices and theglobal economy is likely to be small in comparison to the oilshock of 1973-74 and 1979 because most countries have beenable to significantly reduce dependence on oil,&quot; says ThomasJ. Berger at the London office of Swiss fund manager LombardOdier.   In addition, the suppliers of oil in the world have becomefar more diverse. The Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries has in recent months accounted for barely a thirdof the world's oil production, down from more than half in1974. And Cambridge Energy Associates estimates there is nowas much as 600,000 barrels a day of additional potentialproduction capacity outside of OPEC, in the U.S., the NorthSea, Mexico and elsewhere.                                                                                                          But perhaps the most striking difference between thecurrent crisis and those of the 1970s is the absence ofpanic. No milieu better dramatized Roosevelt's maxim aboutfear: Panic buying, tank topping and widespread hoarding iswhat drove oil prices sky high in the 1970s, as people andcompanies feared oil at $70 a barrel or more -- or fearedthat oil would be unavailable at any price. The doomsayers ofthe seventies forgot that as prices went up, new sources ofsupply would become economic. Instead of reaching $70 abarrel, oil peaked at close to $40 a barrel.                                                                                                          In some countries, there also was massive diversificationaway from oil to other forms of energy, such ashydroelectricity and nuclear power. In the U.S., acomplicated system of price controls made the situationworse, playing havoc with supply and serving to heightenpanic, hoarding and price hysteria.   This time, a conspicuous confidence in the world's abilityto weather the crisis has kept oil price increases far moremodest, in percentage terms, than the tripling and doublingof prices that occurred in the 1970s.   President Bush's decisive action stands in sharp contrastto Jimmy Carter's dithering in 1979 and to the terror andparalysis that struck the major industrial economies in the1973-1974 oil embargo. The swift U.S.-led military responseto Iraq's invasion -- at least for now -- has removed much ofthe threat to the world's richest oil fields, which producemore than seven million barrels of oil a day. Saudi Arabia,Venezuela and possibly the United Arab Emirates areapparently willing to increase their output to offset much ofthe loss of Iraq and Kuwaiti oil. And in contrast to 1979,the U.S. has appeared to retain the initiative.                                                                                                          &quot;Nobody declared an embargo on the U.S., we declared anembargo on them,&quot; says Vahan Zanoyan of the Petroleum FinanceCo., a Washington consultancy. &quot;We're hitting, we aren'tbeing hit. There's a very important psychologicaldifference.&quot;                                                                                                          To be sure, no matter how successful the West is inpreventing panic, the current crisis will exact its costs.There will be continuing disruption as consumers who boughtKuwaiti and Iraqi oil struggle to find alternative supplies.That will be particularly tough for Japan and other Pacificnations who have relied on Kuwait's refined oil products, andalso for developing nations like Brazil and India that importa lot of Iraqi crude.   Moreover, if the current face-off between Presidents Bushand Hussein continues, the world's reserves may slowly bedrawn down, and oil prices will climb higher. In addition,the Iraqi crisis looks like it may be just bad enough tonudge the already-teetering U.S. economy brink intorecession.   But barring an undeterred Iraqi invasion of the Saudi oilfields -- which is increasingly unlikely -- the world willemerge from this crisis far less scarred than it did fromthose of the 1970s.</TEXT></DOC>
