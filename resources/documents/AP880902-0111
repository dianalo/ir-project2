The Soviet Union's installations in Tartus include submarine andsurface ship maintenance facilities and constitute the largestSoviet naval base in the Mediterranean, said Dore Gold of Tel AvivUniversity's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies.   According to Aharon Levran, editor of The Middle East MilitaryBalance published this week by the center, the facilities extend toArwad island and include recreation facilities for Soviet crews.   Gold said there was no declassified information available on thecurrent or planned size of the Soviet base but said the generaltrend has been one of expansion at least since 1987.   In addition, the Soviets use land installations in Syria fornaval and air intelligence-gathering, the two analysts said inseparate interviews with The Associated Press.   Gold said that the main objective of the Tartus base expansionwas to counter the presence of the U.S. 6th Fleet in theMediterranean.   The Soviets had to find new arrangements in the region afterAlbania shifted its alliance to China in 1961 and Egypt abrogatedits friendship treaty with Moscow in 1976, he said.   He said the Tartus facility was important for prolongeddeployment of Soviet attack submarines in the Mediterranean.   In an article published today in the English-language dailyJerusalem Post, Gold noted that the London-based Jane's DefenseWeekly in May referred to Tartus as ``the primary maintenancefacility for Soviet submarines operating in the Mediterranean.''   Levran said the Soviets have been using Tartus for at least fiveyears and that the base's expansion apparently was a price Syriahad to pay for purchasing Soviet weapons.   In spite of the Kremlin's recent reluctance to supply Syria withadvanced weapons systems, he said, ``Syria is still the SovietUnion's strategic asset in the Middle East.''   He said the base replaced the Soviet practice of usingMediterranean Squadron's mother-ships for maintenance. But he saidthe base was less important than the recently developed Soviet FarEastern base in Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam.   Syria's navy, Levran wrote in the 1987-88 Middle East MilitaryBalance, ``underwent a radical facelift'' due to supplies, trainingand maintenance cooperation from the Soviet Union.   The Soviet base in Tartus could ``create a problem'' for Israelin wartime because Israel may be reluctant to harm a Soviet-flaggedfacility, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
