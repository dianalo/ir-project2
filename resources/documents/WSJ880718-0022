The vote upholds Centel's claim at its annual meeting last month that it had defeated a shareholders' group led by New York investor Asher B. Edelman. Mr. Edelman's group sought three seats on the telecommunications company's board and retention of cumulative voting. A final tally was delayed until this month.    Centel said the company slate of board nominees received more than 80%, or 28.8 million, of about 36 million Centel shares voted. The dissident slate received 5.1 million shares, or less than 15% of the shares voted. About 82% of the company's 43.5 million outstanding shares were cast in the voting, Centel said.    About 72%, or 25.9 million shares, voted to approve an amendment to the company's bylaws eliminating cumulative voting.    Mr. Edelman and his group, who held a 5.5% stake in Centel, had proposed a $2.68 billion hostile takeover of Centel. The voting loss was seen as a blow to any effort to pursue the move. Officials of the group couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
