A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals inWashington said the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war had renderedthe war-powers issue moot.   The ruling was made by Circuit Judges Patricia Wald, HarryEdwards and Stephen Williams in a brief order filed Monday and madepublic Tuesday.   The panel had been asked to review a lower court's dismissallast year of the lawsuit on the ground that it presented apolitical question upon which judges cannot rule.   The appeals court, however, dismissed the case without decidingthat question.   The issue in the case filed by Rep. Mike Lowry, D-Wash., and 109colleagues was whether President Reagan should have notifiedCongress within 48 hours of sending Navy ships to escort reflaggedKuwaiti oil tankers in the Persian Gulf last year.   The 1983 War Powers Resolution requires the president, in theabsence of a declaration of war, to notify Congress whenever U.S.forces are sent into hostilities.   The lawmakers claimed they were denied participation in thewarmaking process because Reagan did not submit notice. Under theresolution, the president must withdraw forces within 60 daysabsent a declaration or war or seek an extension from Congress.   The members of Congress ``can claim no present injury as aresult of their reduced ability to participate in a process whichhas been completed,'' the court said.   ``Appellants' assertion of continuing injury is thus logicallydependent upon their ability to demonstrate that hostilities arecurrently present or imminent. That demonstration cannot be made,''the court said.   One of the plaintiffs, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said thecourt's decision ``was a disaster for the War Powers Resolution andthe Constitution.''   ``Future presidents will have no hesitation (to ignore) theclear requirements of this law. ... As of today, the War PowersResolution isn't worth the paper it was printed on,'' he said in astatement.   The court had asked both sides to file briefs on how thecease-fire between Iran and Iraq affected the case.   Lawmakers argued in their brief that U.S. forces still facedimminent hostilities because the cease-fire between the twocountries is unstable.   But the court said the court could not decide the merits of thatclaim because it ``would require an inquiry into the likelyintentions of the Iranian and Iraqi governments'' that is ``beyondthe judicial competence.''</TEXT></DOC>
