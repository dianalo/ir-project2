Ltd.announced today they were buyers of portions of Tenneco Inc.'s oiland gas properties.   Shell, part of the Royal Dutch-Shell Group, said it would buyTenneco's Colombian operations for $500 million, while British Gassaid it was the successful bidder for a hodgepodge of Tenneco'sinternational oil and gas interests with a $194.5 million offer.   On Tuesday, Tenneco estimated the net proceeds from its assetsale would be $6.4 billion on a gross take of $7.3 billion.   Tenneco, based in Houston, Texas, is auctioning its oil and gasinterests to pay down $8.5 billion in debt and to concentrate onits pipeline and industrial businesses. On Monday, eight othercompanies announced they were buying various parts of the oil andgas properties.   The main Colombian operation Shell is buying is Houston OilColombia SA, which is currently producing about 40,000 barrels aday.   Output from Tenneco's Colombian interests have been restrainedby pipeline constraints, and production will rise when a newpipeline is installed, said a Shell official in London, who was notidentified, in accordance with British custom.   Shell already has a 25 percent stake in the Cano Limon field inColombia, which it acquired when it bought Occidental PetroleumCorp.'s Colombian operations in 1985. The field produces about170,000 barrels a day.   British Gas' purchase is a major step in its diversificationefforts since it was privatized by the government in late 1986.   British Gas said it was buying all of Tenneco's non-NorthAmerican oil interests, excluding those in Norway and Colombia. Thepurchase includes interests in Ecuador, Eygpt, Gabon, Malaysia,Nigeria, the Bahamas, Trinidad, Tunisia and Britain.   British Gas said the interests contain estimated proven andprobable reserves of 47 million barrels of oil equivalent. Abouttwo-third's of the reserves are oil.   British Gas has been increasing its non-gas and non-Britishactivities since its privatization. In 1987 it bought Acre Oil PLCfor 370 million pounds, or $640 million, and bought 51 percent ofCanada-based Bow Valley Industries Ltd. after a protracted battlewith Canadian regulators.   In September, British Gas launched a ``dawn raid'' on London andScottish Marine Oil PLC, known as Lasmo, but only managed to getabout 1.1 percent of the company's stock, well short of its statedintention of buying 14.9 percent.   Among the transactions announced Monday, Chevron Corp. agreed tobuy Tenneco's Gulf of Mexico oil and natural gas reserves,production facilities and leasehold interests for nearly $2.6billion.
