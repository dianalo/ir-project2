More often than not, Soviet forces openly sided with Azerbaijanis inthe conflict, and critics charged that the Kremlin was using the unrest as anexcuse to continue exercising control over the republics.;   &quot;Hopefully, thebelligerents will get down to talks at long last,&quot; said Yeltsin, who labeledthe agreement a &quot;historic&quot; compromise that offers hope for progress.;   Morethan 800 people have died in Nagorno-Karabakh and the adjoining Shaumiandistrict since fighting erupted in 1988. Both regions, populated mainly byChristian Armenians, have been seeking autonomy from surrounding MuslimAzerbaijan.;   During four days of shuttle mediation in the rival republics,Yeltsin sharply criticized Gorbachev's handling of the crisis, enhancing againthe Russian president's status as the emerging power broker in the post-coupSoviet Union.;   Then, fueling two weeks of speculation that Yeltsin wassuffering from a heart problem, his spokesman announced Tuesday that theRussian president would be taking a leave of absence from work that could lasta couple of weeks. He gave no explanation.;   New ethnic fighting; Even asparticipants hammered out final details of their communique, ethnic fightingflared anew in the two disputed enclaves in Azerbaijan.;   The independentInterfax news agency reported attacks by both Azerbaijani and Armenian troopson villages in the region Monday, with at least five civilians killed.;   Inthe other Transcaucasus republic, Georgia, embattled President ZviadGamsakhurdia declared a state of emergency and called on his supporters tomobilize in his defense in the capital of Tbilisi.;   Armed opponents ofGamsakhurdia attacked a power station in Tbilisi early today but were drivenback by police, leaving four dead and four wounded, Gamsakhurdia reported.;  In the conservative Soviet Central Asian republic of Tadzhikistan, more than10,000 demonstrators continued a rally Tuesday in the capital of Dushanbe,defying a state of emergency order.
