The Intergroup bloc claimed Rocard's government showed``contempt'' for the parliament by including proposed legislationin recent votes of confidence. If the vote of confidence passes,the bill is also approved.   The censure motion received 218 votes from the 577-seat NationalAssembly, 70 votes short of the number needed to dissolve thegovernment.   Neither the centrists nor the Communists agreed to back themotion.   Intergroup is made up of the Rally for the Republic and theUnion for French Democracy parties.   In November, a censure motion, the first the Communist Partyagreed to back, was five votes short of passing. It was filed toprotest a new 1.1 percent social services tax to replace anexisting tax paid by employers and employees.</TEXT></DOC>
