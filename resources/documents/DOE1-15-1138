The mechanisms of heat transferdeterioration, concerning maximum allowable wall temperatures are particularlyinvestigated. The most accredited heat transfer correlations are comparedwith Bandamp;W test data and with some measurements performed by ENEL at asupercritical 660 MWe steam generator.</TEXT></DOC>
