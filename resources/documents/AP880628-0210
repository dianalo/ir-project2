The lawsuit contends that random drug testing of employees insensitive jobs is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy thatviolates the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches.   The suit, filed a day after the Justice Department announcedplans to begin random testing in two months, also contends that theprogram is being implemented ``without any factual showing of aproblem of drug use in the department.''   The plan is ``arbitrary, capricious and abuse of discretion''because it ``would not require any suspicion that a particularindividual has used drugs prior to testing, and would subjectemployees to urinalysis tests for drug use even though such testsdo not indicate whether employees are impaired in their jobperformance by drug use,'' said the lawsuit filed by formerMaryland attorney general Stephen H. Sachs, who has also served asa U.S. attorney in the state.   The 42 plaintiffs named in the suit were mostly JusticeDepartment trial attorneys plus several supervisors, includingthree deputy chiefs of the civil rights division's criminalsection: Barry Kowalski, Daniel L. Bell and Norajean M. Flanagan.   Arthur Spitzer, an American Civil Liberties Union attorneyinvolved in the case, said he had spoken to a number of otherJustice Department officials who privately supported the lawsuitbut didn't want to join it for fear of hurting their careers.   The drug testing plan is part of the Reagan administration'sprogram for a ``drug-free workplace'' in the federal government.Random drug testing has been challenged by a number of federalemployee groups.   Several federal appellate courts have upheld various kinds ofdrug testing programs. But these courts have yet to ruledefinitively on challenges to widespread random drug testing offederal workers under the ``drug-free workplace'' program.   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington is scheduled tohear arguments next fall on challenges to drug testing ofTransportation Department and civilian Army employees.   The same court ruled last year that the invasion of privacyentailed by testing could not be justified if the test didn'tproduce evidence that employees were impaired by drug use while onthe job.</TEXT></DOC>
