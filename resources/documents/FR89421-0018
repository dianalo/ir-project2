Justen, 813-893-3722.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The shrimp fishery is managed underthe FMP and its implementing regulations at 50 CFR Part 658, as providedby the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act).Under the FMP, the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director),may modify by no more than 10 percent the geographical scope of the Tortugasshrimp sanctuary specified at andSection; 658.22 after (1) consultation withthe Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council), (2) considerationof specified criteria, and (3) determination that benefits may be increasedor adverse impacts decreased by the modification. The primary purpose of establishing the sanctuary was to protect smallshrimp and allow them to attain a larger, more valuable size prior to harvest.The FMP stipulates that, prior to any modification of the sanctuary, NMFSwill monitor and assess the impacts of the closure and advise the Councilof its findings. The Council may also consider the advice of its ShrimpAdvisory Panel regarding the findings. When the sanctuary was partially opened in 1983-1984, NMFS determined thatharvestable populations of shrimp occur periodically within a small portionof the sanctuary_a fact strongly supported by public testimony. Fishermencontend that shrimp from within this portion of the sanctuary emigrateto untrawlable areas and are unavailable to the fishery. Poor recruitmentof shrimp to the Tortugas fishery has resulted in 2 consecutive years ofpoor production and economic loss to the adjacent shrimp ports. As identifiedin the FMP, poor recruitment in the unique shrimp fishery is more a functionof environmental forces than of overfishing. Opening the area of the sanctuarycontaining all sizes of shrimp is consistent with optimum yield becauseit will allow shrimpers to obtain, on a temporary basis, a more valuablecatch per unit of effort. Thus, the Regional Director, after consulting with the Council and consideringthe criteria for modifying the sanctuary, has determined that the smallportion (approximately 54 square nautical miles) of the sanctuary thatperiodically contains harvestable shrimp should be opened for 1 year. Thisarea is less than 10 percent of the total geographical scope of the sanctuaryand such modification will increase the benefits to fishermen by optimizingthe yield of shrimp. This temporary geographic modification is consistentwith Objective 1 of the FMP because it provides temporary economic reliefto the stressed fishermen while continuing to optimize the yield of shrimprecruited to the fishery. To maximize the intended economic benefits of this action, it was necessaryto make the geographic modification as soon as possible after November1, 1988. November 1 marks the onset of the six-month period when peak landingsoccur. Accordingly, NOAA published an emergency final rule on November9, 1988 (53 FR 45270), that implemented the geographic modification for90 days (November 4, 1988 through February 2, 1989). During this periodNOAA expected to (1) publish the proposed rule to extend the period ofthe boundary modification so as to provide a total period of one year andto require a report of incidental catch of sea turtles in the opened portionof the shrimp sanctuary, (2) receive public comments on the proposed rule,(3) obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on thereporting requirement of the proposed rule, and (4) publish this finalrule. These actions were not completed by February 2, 1989, and the Tortugasshrimp sanctuary reverted to its normal boundaries after that date. This final rule modifies the boundary of the Tortugas shrimp sanctuaryto reduce the area closed to trawl fishing and requires a report of theincidental take of any threatened or endangered sea turtle in the openedpart of the sanctuary, effective from May 22, 1989 through November 3,1989. The opened part of the sanctuary under this rule is the same as wasopened under the emergency final rule. Analysis of the impacts of the boundary modification, including its impacton endangered species, was included in the proposed rule (54 FR 2175, January19, 1989) and is not reported here.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Responses </ITAG>Seven written responses were received commenting on (1) temporarily modifyinguntil November 3, 1989, the boundary of the Tortugas shrimp sanctuary toreduce the area closed to trawl fishing, and (2) requiring a report ofthe incidental take of any threatened or endangered sea turtle in the openarea of the Tortugas shrimp sanctuary. 1. Temporary Modification of the Boundary of the Tortugas Shrimp SanctuaryUntil November 3, 1989 One comment from a seafood dealer was received supporting the extensionbecause the economic conditions that existed when the boundary modificationwas implemented on November 4, 1988, continue to exist. The commenter alsonoted that an interruption of the boundary modification would leave manyquestions unanswered. Thirty-one spiny lobster and stone crab fishermenopposed this action because they deployed traps in portions of the 54-squaremile open area. Fixed trap gear cannot be safely deployed in an area fishedwith mobile, trawl gear. These fishermen contended that opening this areaof the Tortugas shrimp sanctuary created the conditions for fishermen usingtrawl gear to inadvertently destroy about 6,500 spiny lobster and stonecrab pots. Comments from the Center for Marine Conservation, a professor from a seagrant college, and three individuals objected to opening the 54-squaremile area of this sanctuary without concurrent requirements for the useof Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs). These commenters were concerned aboutthe shrimp fleets incidental, inadvertent catch and kill of endangeredand threatened sea turtles. NOAA has decided to extend the temporary modification of the Tortugas shrimpsanctuary until November 3, 1989. The risk of further conflict betweenfishermen using fixed and trawl gear is minimal because most of the traploss occurred soon after the area was opened. Also, the spiny lobster seasonends on March 31, 1989. The stone crab season ends May 15 but most stonecrab fishing ends well before that time. All spiny lobster gear must beremoved at the end of the season and most fishermen remove their stonecrab pots about the same time due to unprofitable catch rates during thelast two months of the season. In any case, this final rule gives amplenotice to fishermen to remove fixed gear from the opened portion of thesanctuary. NOAA does not agree with requiring the use of TEDs in the open area ofthe sanctuary. As was indicated in the emergency rule, the implementationof regulations that require the use of TEDs and other conservation measuresin the ocean area around the Tortugas shrimp sanctuary, and elsewhere,was delayed by Congress until May 1, 1989. At that time, the regulationswill become effective for the opened portion of the Tortugas shrimp sanctuaryas well. NOAA remains convinced of the benefits of properly used TEDs tothe conservation of endangered and threatened sea turtles. However, therequired use of TEDs in the 54-square mile area of the sanctuary beforetheir required use in adjacent areas would be unnecessarily cumbersome,difficult to enforce, counterproductive to orderly implementation of themore general requirements for TEDs and other conservation measures, andcontrary to the present Congressional mandate. 2. Reporting Incidental Catches of Sea Turtles and Following ResuscitationTechniques and Release Procedures One comment from a seafood dealer was received in support of reportingthe incidental catch of sea turtles and requiring resuscitation of comatoseturtles. One commenter from a sea grant college objected to requiring seaturtle catch reports, resuscitation procedures, and release techniquesas mitigation measures instead of requiring the use of TEDs in the 54-squaremile open area. NOAA views the mitigation measures included in this ruleas adequate until the more general requirements for TEDs and other conservationmeasures become effective in this area. <ITAG tagnum="84">Changes From the Proposed Rule </ITAG>In the reporting requirement for the incidental take of a threatened orendangered sea turtle in the opened portion of the sanctuary (andSection;658.5(c)), the availability of reporting forms, sea turtle identificationguides, and resuscitation techniques has been added as a convenience tofishermen. <ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>The Assistant Adminstrator for Fisheries, NOAA (Assistant Administrator),determined that this rule is consistent with the national standards andother provisions of the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the SmallBusiness Administration that this rule would not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities because the geographicalarea affected by the rule is small and, as a result, the number of fishermenaffected in the Gulf-wide and Florida-wide fisheries would not be substantial.As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. The Council prepared a regulatory impact review (RIR) for this rule. Basedon the RIR, the Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, NOAA, determinedthat the rule is not major under E.O. 12291 because it would not have anannual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; would not resultin an increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; andwould not result in significant adverse effects on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of U.S.-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The Council prepared an environmental assessment (EA) for this rule and,based on the EA, the Assistant Administrator concluded that there willbe no significant adverse impact on the human environment as a result ofthis rule. This rule contains a collection-of-information requirement subject to thePaperwork Reduction Act. A request to collect this information has beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB Control Number0648-0219. Public reporting burden for this collection of information isestimated to average 12 minutes per response, including the time for reviewinginstructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintainingthe data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to: Michael E. Justen, Southeast Region, NMFS, and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, OMB (See <T2>ADDRESSES</T2>). This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under E.O. 12612. The Council determined that this rule will be implemented in a manner thatis consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the approved coastalzone management program of Florida. This determination was submitted forreview by Florida under Section 307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act.Florida failed to comment within the statutory time period and concurrenceis therefore implied.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>50 CFR Part 204Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.50 CFR Part 658Fisheries, Fishing, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated April 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
