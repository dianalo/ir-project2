David R. Farmer was testifying Friday in the trial of threeformer savings and loan executives on charges that they allegedlyparticipated in what federal prosecutors say was a conspiracy bythe thrifts to evade federal laws by channeling corporatecontributions to political campaigns.   Wright was not named in the federal indictment against the threedefendants, Robert Hopkins, Morton Hopkins and John Harrell, whowere charged after investigations by the Dallas Bank Fraud TaskForce.   The three are former executives of Commodore Savings Association.   Farmer, former senior vice president and chief financial officerof Commodore, said he gave a $1,000 donation to the East TexasFirst Political Action Committee in 1985, then was told to file afalse expense report to get the money back.   Farmer said it was understood that Wright, the Democraticmajority leader at the time, had guaranteed that specificlegislation unfavorable to savings and loans would be blocked frommaking it out of committee. The former Commodore executive did notcite the legislation.   ``In return for the contributions, Jim Wright guaranteed thelegislation would not get out of committee,'' Farmer said. ``BothJohn (Harrell) and myself were amazed that as high ranking anindividual in the Congress as he (Wright) would be involved insomething like this.''   Under questioning, Farmer said 10 savings and loans werecontributing a total of $250,000 to the political fund.   In other testimony this week, witnesses said Commodore employeesgave donations to a political action committee and were givenraises in return.   A Commodore secretary testified that some of the money donatedto the political action committee was laundered through VernonSavings and Loan. On one check the words ``For Jim Wright'' werewritten on the memo line, she said.   Calls from The Associated Press to Wright's Washington and FortWorth, Texas, offices went unanswered late Friday night. Wrightspoke in his hometown of Fort Worth Friday to the Tarrant CountyBar Association and the Fort Worth Rotary Club.   The allegations against Wright in the federal trial came as thespeaker's business transactions have been under fire by the Houseethics committee.</TEXT></DOC>
