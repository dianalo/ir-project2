(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Robert L. ScheierandM;Information systems are only as good as the information put into them.andM;That point was driven home last week as officials at Lockheed AeronauticalSystems Corp. said the failure to include critical data in an executiveinformation system (EIS) prevented the system from spotting a problem thatcould cost the company $300 million.andM;What turned out to be the critical information was the weight of Lockheed'snew P-7 antisubmarine aircraft, which was rising beyond expectations.andM;Officials at the Burbank, Calif., firm said they failed to include the weightdata as they were inputting information about the P-7 into the EIS.andM;&quot;We were two or three steps away from reaching the piece that in this casewas critical,&quot; said George Houdeshel, who was systems manager for the EISbefore retiring in December.andM;&quot;Only [some] pieces of the puzzle were in the automated system,&quot; added BillBernstein, a Lockheed vice president and program manager for the P-7.andM;The EIS didn't catch the detail.andP;  Instead, Bernstein found it on printoutsgenerated by a separate computer system.andM;It was only then that Lockheed officials discovered why the weight wasrising: Designers had originally counted on reusing certain parts from anearlier aircraft, the P-3.andP;  But the inclusion of these parts would haveprevented the P-7 from meeting the Navy's structural and performancerequirements.andM;As a result, Lockheed was forced to design new parts, which unexpectedlydrove up the weight of the aircraft.andM;The mistake, disclosed last fall by Lockheed officials, could cost as much as$300 million and may cause the firm to report a net loss for the year.andM;Houdeshel and Bernstein declined to say exactly why the weight informationwas not included earlier.andM;Decisions about what was to be included in the EIS involved both executivesand information-systems staff, according to Houdeshel.andP;  However, suchdecisions are complicated by the fact that the potentially criticalinformation is not always obvious.andM;&quot;I wouldn't have thought the weight problem would have been critical, but ithappened to be in this case,&quot; he said.andM;Lockheed's 12-year-old EIS, which was developed in-house, and runs on aDigital Equipment Corp. VAX, and is accessed through IBM XTs or PS/2 Model50s.andM;Executives can use it to call up stick drawings of C-130 transports, forexample, showing their progress down the assembly line, with wings andengines appearing as the planes near completion.andM;They can also scroll through instant updates on sales negotiations withforeign governments -- including the names of key contacts, whether thebuyers have financing and the probability of closing the sale.andM;&quot;Lockheed was a real pioneer when it came to EIS,&quot; said David Friend,president of Pilot Executive Software Inc., an EIS vendor in Boston.andM;&quot;We don't know what kind of disasters the EIS has averted, because you won'tread about them in The Wall Street Journal.andP;  But I bet there's plenty ofthem, because people at that company speak very highly of that system.&quot;andM;Many EISs &quot;are limited to the tracking and control of various financial andproduction numbers,&quot; he said.andP;  But what really should be included in an EISare &quot;issues,&quot; he explained, such as details of Lockheed's P-7 contract withthe Navy.andM;&quot;It might be weather information for oil-drilling companies,&quot; Friend said.andO;&quot;These are things executives deal in, but they're just not naturally capturedin the system.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
