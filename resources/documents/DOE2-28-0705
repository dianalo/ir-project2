<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-28-0705 </DOCNO><TEXT>Multigrid (MG) computational methods and their applications are examinedin reviews and reports of recent investigations. Topics discussed includeMG acceleration of a two-dimensional full potential flow solver, fastpseudoinverse algorithms on hypercubes, MG methods for fermion computationsin QCD, design and implementation of parallel MG algorithms, and MG Eulersolvers. Consideration is given to Fourier estimates for MG methods inthree-dimensional elasticity, MG methods for the NASA/Princeton Navier-StokesComputer, the simple pressure-correction method as a nonlinear smoother,and a cell-centered MG for interface problems.</TEXT></DOC>
