The fast-growing concern, known for its secretive and aggressive style, laid off 90 of its more than 800-member staff at the company's Boston headquarters. More than half of those dismissed are partners, managers and consultants.    Insiders said that the layoffs were necessary because the company's revenue growth fell short of projections last year.    &quot;The move was part of an overall streamlining of the company's structure,&quot; a spokesman said. &quot;We took a look at ourselves and thought certain areas needed trimming in order to keep up the growth of the past few years.&quot; Bain had a total of 1,400 employees world-wide.    Despite the layoffs, Bain said it plans to continue hiring new employees, and at the end of this year expects employment to be higher than the level prior to the layoffs. Even so, Bain will be able to improve profitability because the new employees will earn considerably less than many of the senior officials who were dismissed.    Bain, whose clients include Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp., Chrysler Corp. and Eastman Kodak Co., doubled its revenue to about $200 million in 1987 from $100 million in 1985, making it the nation's 11th largest management consulting firm, according to Consultant News, an industry newsletter.    Bain most recently was in the spotlight because of its role as consultant to Guinness PLC in the British company's takeover of Distillers Co. in 1986. Bain's main consultant to Guinness, Olivier Roux, resigned as a director and top financial strategist of Guinness following an investigation of the takeover tactics by the British government. The government suspects a possibly illegal share manipulation helped Guinness win the Distillers bid.    Guinness was once one of Bain's largest clients, generating millions of dollars a year in revenue, but the British concern now says it is &quot;phasing (Bain) out fast&quot; as a consultant.    The layoffs surprised many at Bain. Insiders said the mood at the company was somber. &quot;It's like the office is suffering a hangover,&quot; said one retained employee.    Employees were told of the layoffs Monday, sources said. After those being cut were informed, other employees met at the Park Plaza Hotel in Boston, where company officials explained the cutback.    One employee said that, in keeping with Bain's close-mouthed nature, the explanations were kept to a minimum. &quot;A management team read to us from a prepared text,&quot; the employee said. &quot;At the end of the reading, an executive said, 'We've tried to anticipate some of your questions and read written responses to them. . . . No more questions, please.'&quot;    Bain yesterday denied rumors that it has lost some major accounts.    Insiders said one reason for the changes is to concentrate more on larger clients; some of those dismissed were on smaller accounts. </TEXT></DOC>
