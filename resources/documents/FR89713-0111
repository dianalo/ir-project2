However,section 205(b) of the 1973 Act (42 U.S.C. 4128(b)) provides that FederalAgencies and Federal Instrumentalities shall, in cooperation with the Directorof the Federal Emergency Management Agency, issue appropriate rules andregulations to govern the carrying out of the Agencies' and Instrumentalities'responsibilities under the 1973 Act. Pursuant to this mandate for cooperation, during the period in which FIAwas a part of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development,FIA issued Guidelines designed to provide such guidance concerning theinsurance purchase requirements as might be helpful in promoting greateruniformity and understanding of the requirements among Federal Agencies,Federal Instrumentalities, private lending institutions, and their tradeassociations, and the public. Over the past ten years numerous questionsof interpretation have arisen which have been discussed at many productivemeetings between FIA and representatives of Federal Instrumentalities andAgencies. While FIA's Guidelines are not binding upon these groups, FIAwas encouraged by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Councilto update the earlier Guidelines, and the Council members, who have reviewedinterim drafts of these Guidelines and offered valuable suggestions, haveagreed to disseminate this final edition.

Introduction</ITAG>1. Statutory Authority for the National Insurance ProgramThe National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) became effective on January28, 1969, (33 FR 17804) and was authorized by the National Flood InsuranceAct of 1968, (Title XIII of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968,as amended, Public Law 90-448, 82 Stat 476, 48 U.S.C. 4001-4128). The positionof Federal Insurance Administrator was authorized by the Urban PropertyProtection and Reinsurance Act of 1968, (Title XI of the Housing and UrbanDevelopment Act of 1968, and the Federal Insurance Administration was establishedunder the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 as part of the UnitedStates Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The Secretaryof HUD delegated to the Federal Insurance Administrator the responsibilityfor administering the NFIP.Subsequently, on June 19, 1978, President Carter forwarded to the CongressReorganization Plan No. 3 of the 1978 (43 FR 41493) (which had the effectof a Federal statute). This Plan, in addition to creating the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency (FEMA), transferred the functions authorized and describedin the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and the position of FederalInsurance Administrator to FEMA. The organization of FEMA was further definedin Executive Order 12127, dated March 31, 1979 (44 FR 19367) and ExecutiveOrder 12148, dated June 20, 1979. On April 1, 1979, in a notice publishedin 44 FR 20962, and later codified at 44 CFR 2.64, the Director of FEMAdelegated responsibility for the administration of the NFIP to the FederalInsurance Administrator of the Federal Insurance Adminstration (FIA), whichhad become a Directorate within FEMA.2. Background History and Brief Description of the National Flood InsuranceProgramBetween 70 and 80 percent of all natural disasters in the United Statesinvolve flooding, and from its earliest days the Federal government hasbeen involved with the peril of flooding. Through re-channeling, or throughdams and levees, restricting the flow of waters, as well as through thedevelopment of hydroelectric power and irrigation, the Federal governmenthas attempted to ameliorate the effects of flooding. But in spite of allthese actions, vast sums of money have had to be expended through the responsemechanism of Federal Disaster Assistance.In 1968 the Congress embarked upon a new course of action and focused uponways in which flood damage could be avoided or reduced by making the publicaware of its potential exposure to flooding and by providing, through theauthorization of a Federal flood insurance program, an incentive to encouragecommunities to adopt floodplain management ordinance that would mitigatethe effects of flooding upon new construction. Taking note of the factthat insurance coverage against the peril of flooding was virtually unavailablein the private sector, the Congress enacted the National Flood InsuranceAct of 1968, and authorized the National Flood Insurance Program, whichrepresented a new approach to assisting the victims of flooding by providingan opportunity for property owners to purchase from the Federal governmentinsurance protection for structures and contents exposed to the peril offlooding.Because the availability of government flood insurance without hazard mitigationwould only have increased the potential for flood damage by encouragingunwise construction, FIA was directed under the 1968 Act to conduct studiesthroughout the United States to determine in each community the locationof areas of special flood hazard and to issue Flood Hazard Boundary Maps(FHBM) and Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) showing the location of theseareas and to notify each community of such identification. Eligibilityfor the purchase of flood insurance was made available only to those individualsor corporations whose insurable property is located within a communitythat has agreed with the Federal government to adopt ordinances that willmitigate the impact of future flooding. The most significant of these requiredordinances are those which, for example, condition the issuance of buildingpermits for new residential construction in areas of special flood hazardupon the requirement that the building be constructed so that the lowestfloor will be located above the base flood elevation, if that figure isprovided on a Flood Insurance Rate Map issued by FIA.Participating communities that fail to adequately enforce their flood plainmanagement ordinances may be placed on probation if they do not take correctiveactions within a specified time period. NFIP policyholders in that communitywill be notified of the pending probation and that their policies may becomesubject to a surcharge on their flood insurance premiums. If a communitywhich has been placed on probation fails to bring its floodplain managementprogram into compliance with the NFIP requirements, it may be suspendedfrom the NFIP, a step which would terminate its status as a participatingcommunity. In that event NFIP policies would not be renewed for propertyowners in that community and no new policies would be issued. Experienceshows that the probation process leads to compliance and, as of January1989, only three communities have had to be suspended for lack of compliance.However, communities are routinely suspended for failure to adopt or amendtheir floodplain management ordinances to incorporate new flood hazardinformation or revisions of NFIP regulations. Experience shows that withina very short time most of these communities become participating again.3. Status of Studies and Maps for the National Flood Insurance Programas of January, 1989Some 18,642 communities have been identified as flood prone through thepublication of a flood map by FIA. The total number of communities participatingin the NFIP is 17,797, including some 1,851 communities for which no specialflood hazards have been identified and for which no map has been published.Property owners within these participating communities are eligible topurchase flood insurance to protect buildings located anywhere within suchcommunities, both inside and outside of special flood hazard areas (subjectto restrictions of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, discussed below).Some 2,700 communities which have been mapped do not presently participate,and property owners in those communities are not eligible to purchase floodinsurance.While these figures constantly change, as a benchmark it may be usefulto record the fact that as of January, 1989, of the 17,797 participatingcommunities, 16,537 are in the Regular Program. Their property owners,therefore, are eligible to purchase the maximum amounts of insurance coverageavailable under the Program.Presently, only 1,260 participating communities remain in the EmergencyProgram phase, where only limited amounts of insurance are available. Floodrisk studies currently underway in these communities are scheduled forcompletion before September 30, 1991. Upon their completion, Flood InsuranceRate Maps will be issued and will replace the Flood Hazard Boundary Mapscurrently in effect for each of these communities. At that time, thesecommunities will, also, be eligible for conversion to the Regular Programphase and eligibility for higher amounts of insurance coverage.Special flood hazard areas are determined with reference to the ``100-year''flood standard, which is the national standard on which NFIP regulationsare based. It is also the standard adopted by virtually every federal agencyand most state agencies for the administartion of their floodplain managementprograms. The 100-year flood, also referred to as a base flood, is definedas the flood having a 1 percent probability of being equalled or exceededin any given year. The risk of experiencing a flood of this magnitude increaseswith the length of time considered.Of special interest to lenders is the fact that within the special floodhazard area there is a 26 percent chance (about 1 in 4) of experiencingsuch a flood over a typical 30 year mortgage period. By contrast, duringthe term of a 30 year mortgage, there is only a 1 percent chance of sufferinga fire loss. But, while necessary for applying floodplain management requirements andestablishing uniform flood insurance rates, the term 100-year flood canbe misleading. Although it represents the long term average recurrenceinterval for a flood of this magnitude, such floods may be experiencedin any given year. There have been numerous instances since the NFIP wasestablished where communities have sustained two, and even three, 100-yearor greater floods within a several year period. A notable example tookplace in the 1970s when within 5 years after experiencing Tropical StormAgnes in 1972, Pennsylvania was batterd by another 100 year flood, demonstratingthe value of the standard as a tool for measuring exposure to a 100 yearflood, but not for predicting its timing. The 100-year flood might be moreproperly termed the ``one percent annual chance flood'', which representsits true probability of being equalled or exceeded in any year. Special flood hazard areas include only those areas which are in the 100-yearfloodplan. The delineation of areas subject to such inundation is determinedby FEMA through engineering studies. Special flood hazard areas are usuallyrefined into Zones A, AO, AH, AE, A99, VO, VE, or V. (Older maps utilizenumbered A Zones, eg. A1, A2, A30, and numbered V Zones, eg. V1, V2, V30in lieu of the newer AE and VE Zones, respectively. (New maps use fewerzone designations for purposes of simplicity). The term special flood hazardarea does not include areas outside the 100-year floodplain, which arereferred to as moderate to minimal risk and are designated Zone X. (Oldermaps differentiate the X Zone into Zones B and C, which represent moderateand minimal flood risks, respectively). Areas for which no flood hazardevaluation has been made by FEMA are designated as Zone D.) 4. Letters of Map Amendment or Map Revision Removing Properties From SpecialFlood Hazard Areas Situations occasionally arise in which a piece of real property is shownon a flood map as being in a special flood hazard area even though theproperty is, in fact, above the 100 year flood level. This happens becauseflood insurance maps cannot reflect every rise in terrain and there willbe instances where there will be ``natural islands'' of high ground inthe special flood hazard area that were inadvertently included in the specialflood hazard areas. Nevertheless, until the map has been changed, lendersare bound by the information shown on FIA maps and cannot validly makea determination on their own that is inconsistent with the map. Fortunately, there is a very workable mechanism for resolving such problems.FIA has created an efficient procedure by which a property owner can submitelevation materials in support of a request for a Letter of Map Amendment(LOMA) removing the property from the special flood hazard area. Such aprocess involves only the property owner and the FIA and does not requirethat the community become involved.  A related but different situation is presented when a property owner, whoseland is within a special flood hazard area below the 100 year flood level,grades and fills the site to raise the level of the land above the 100year flood level. This situation differs from the one above because inthe previous situation the natural level of the land at the time that themap was issued was above the 100 year flood level and no artificial improvementwas needed to accomplish that level. In cases where physical changes havehad to be made to raise the level of the property above the base floodelevation, FIA will not issue a letter of map amendment. However, withthe concurrence of the community FIA will issue a Letter of Map Revision(LOMR) which, for the purposes of the property owner will accomplish thesame purpose. A LOMR can also be used to correct a mistake made in theoriginal analysis or when conditions have changes as in the case of theconstruction or removal of a dam or other flood control structure. The request must be made by, or concurred in, by the community becausechanges in land level that result from grading and the placing of fillon the property may have an impact upon other property owners. The submissionof a request for a letter of map revision from the community evidencesthat the change in land level has been reviewed by the community and beenfound to be compatible with the community's planning. Letters of map revisionmay also be granted in situations where channels have been dug or reservoirsbuilt to reduce base flood elevations and where levees or floodwalls havebeen constructed to protect areas. (It should be noted that in floodwaysof special flood hazard areas, which include the channel of a river andthe adjacent flood-plain that must be reserved in an obstructed condition,the placing of fill or other development is not allowed if it will resultin increased flood levels.) A seemingly related, but different, situation is presented when a propertyowner, whose land is at a level below the 100 year flood level, i.e. thebase flood elevation, in a special flood hazard area, builds an elevatedbuilding, supported by walls or pilings, whose lowest floor is above the100 year flood level. In this situation there is no basis for the issuanceof either a letter of map amendment or map revision. The building is stillin the designated special flood hazard area and its foundation can comeinto direct contract with flood waters. However, the elevation of the buildingwill be reflected in the lower insurance rate and premium that such elevationwill have made possible. Only the Federal Insurance Administration can amend an official map toremove or add a particular property location from a designated SFHA bya Letter of Map Amendment, or revise a map by a Letter of Map Revisionto change the special flood hazard area or revise the elevations on a map.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. The Mandatory Flood Insurance Purchase Requirement </ITAG>1. Background and Legislative History of the Flood Disaster ProtectionAct of 1973 From 1968 until the adoption of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973,the purchase of flood insurance was voluntary. Unfortunately, despite theavailability of the insurance, after major flooding disasters in 1972 itbecame evident that relatively few flood victims had purchased flood insurance.From the standpoint of the Federal government the question has been notwhether the Federal government would be called upon to provide relief tothose who suffered from flooding, but, rather, through what mechanism wouldFederal funds be made available. Therefore, the failure of the public toavail itself of the benefits of flood insurance as an alternative to thedisaster assistance approach became a matter of concern to the Congress.This concern was expressed by the Congress in the findings contained insections 2(a) (2), (3), (4) and (5) of the Flood Disaster Protection Actof 1973 (42 U.S.C. 4002), which noted ``the availability of Federal loans,grants, guaranties, insurance, and other forms of financial assistanceare often determining factors in the utilization of land and the locationand construction of public and private industrial, commercial and residentialfacilities'' and that ``property acquired or constructed with grants orother Federal assistance may be exposed to risk of loss through floods,thus frustrating the purpose of which such assistance was extended'' andthat ``the Nation cannot afford the tragic losses of life caused annuallyby flood occurrences, nor the increasing losses of property suffered byflood victims, most of whom are still inadequately compensated despitethe provision of costly disaster relief''. The Congress defined its purpose in section 2(b)(4) of the 1973 Act asbeing to ``require the purchase of flood insurance by property owners whoare being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated,or insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement ofland or facilities located or to be located in identified areas havingspecial flood hazards''.2. Basic Description of Mandatory Flood Insurance Purchase Requirements,as Contained in the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973Since March 2, 1974, the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, hereinafterthe ``1983 Act'', has required the purchase of flood insurance as a conditionof receiving any form of Federal or Federally related financial assistancefrom any Federal officer or agency for acquisition or construction purposeswith respect to any building or mobile home located in any area that hasbeen identified by the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agencyas a special flood hazard area, within any community participating in theNational Flood Insurance Program. (Recent terminology adopted by the Departmentof Housing and Urban Development and regulatory changes in the languageof the National Flood Insurance Program's Standard Flood Insurance Policyrefer to ``mobile homes'' as ``manufactured homes.'')The act also requires Federal Financial Regulatory Agencies (Federal Instrumentalities)to direct lenders subject to their regulatory jurisdiction to require borrowers,whose security consists of buildings or mobile homes located in a specialflood hazard area in a participating community, to purchase flood insurance.Contents coverage is not required unless, as specified in the statute,there is any ``personel property securing the loan''. 3. Six Fundamental Components of the 1973 ActIn assessing the impact of the 1973 Act and gaining an understanding ofits provisions, the six most important factors to keep in mind are:(a) Although the intent of the statute is to require the purchase of floodinsurance by borrowers in special flood hazard areas, the directives andprohibitions contained in the 1973 Act apply only to Federal officers andagencies, and to Federal Instrumentalities that are required by the statuteto issue implementing rules. The 1973 Act, by itself, does not requireor prohibit action on the part of communities, owners of improved realproperty, or lending institutions. (b) The directives and prohibitions of the 1973 Act require implementingrules only as to transactions that involve improved real estate locatedin special flood hazard areas designated by FEMA on its Flood Hazard BoundaryMaps and Flood Insurance Rate Maps. Improved real estate for purposes ofthe act, is property on which there is already standing, or in the courseof construction, a walled and roofed building insurable under an NFIP floodinsurance policy. (c) Inasmuch as the NFIP does not insure land and provides coverage onlyfor buildings, the fact that part of the borrower's real property may belocated in a special flood hazard area does not require that flood insurancebe purchased for a building located on that real property unless some portionof the building itself, and not just a portion or portions of the realproperty, is located in a special flood hazard area.(d) Because the NFIP and its flood insurance policies are not availablein communities that are not participating in the NFIP, the mandatory floodinsurance purchase requirement applies only with respect to property locatedin special flood hazard areas in communities participating in the NFIP.(e) As to properties located outside the special flood hazard areas, andwhose Zone designations are B, C, X, or D, the 1973 Act does not applyand, therefore, there is no mandatory flood insurance purchase requirement.(f) Lenders are free to consider requiring flood insurance in a participatingcommunity on the basis of their own business judgment, even if the buildingthat is the security for a loan is located outside of a special flood hazardarea.While the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirement applies only toproperties located in special flood hazard areas of participating communities,it is important to remember that flood insurance is available throughoutparticipating communities. This is especially significant in light of thefact that, historically, the NFIP's loss ratio indicates that one-thirdof claims paid have actually been outside of special flood hazard areas.Areas where lenders and property owners may wish to exercise additionalcaution include, but are not limited to, areas subject to flooding dueto stormwater, areas where the NFIP has used approximate methods to mapflood hazard areas, and the more remote areas where no flood hazard areashave been designated by FEMA. To facilitate the purchase of flood insuranceoutside of special flood hazard areas, in January, 1989, the NFIP beganoffering a low cost ``preferred risk'' policy for structures located inZones B, C, and X.Some properties in a participating community may be ineligible for floodinsurance because of statutory restrictions or underwriting rules of theNFIP. The consequences of the unavailability of flood insurance in suchinstances will be discussed further along.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Application of the 1973 Act to Federal Officers and Agencies </ITAG>1. Federal Agencies Defined.Federal Agencies are defined in section 3(a)(2) of the 1973 Act, 42 U.S.C.4003(a)(2), as ``any department, agency, corporation, or other entity orinstrumentality of the executive branch of the Federal Government, andincludes the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal HomeLoan Mortgage Corporation''.2. Application of the 1973 Act in Communities that are participating inthe National Flood Insurance Program.The first application of the mandatory flood insurance purchase provisionof the 1973 Act is contained in section 102(a), 42 U.S.C. 4012a(a), whichaddresses the responsibility of Federal officers and agencies in approvingfinancial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes for use inany special flood hazard area in communities that are participating inthe NFIP. A community participates in the NFIP by entering into an agreementwith the FIA to adopt and enforce ordiances which are designed to reducethe vulnerability of property in that community to the peril of flooding.In return for that participation, most owners of residential and commercialproperty in that community become eligible to purchase flood insurancefor their buildings from the NFIP. If the community is participating inthe NFIP, that participation makes flood insurance available to the propertyowners in that community and Federal officers and agencies are authorizedto provide financial assistance in that community.But, under section 102(a) of the 1973 Act, Federal officers and agenciesare prohibited from providing financial assistance unless the propertyto which that financial assistance is applicable is protected by floodinsurance (if the particular property is eligible for flood insurance underthe rules of the NFIP) and must, therefore, require the purchase of floodinsurance as a condition of making such financial assistance available.The term ``property'' to which the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirementapplies is described as ``the building or mobile home and any personalproperty to which such financial assistance relates''. The flood insurancemust remain in force ``during the anticipated economic life of the project''and the insurance coverage must be ``in an amount that is at least equalto its development or project cost (less estimated land cost) or to themaximum limit of coverage made available under the National Flood InsuranceAct of 1968, whichever is less.'' (But note that when the amount of floodinsurance that can be purchased was raised by the Congress in 1977, a statutorycap on the amount that must be purchased was established by the Congress.)3. Effect of Letters of Map Amendment and Map Revision Upon Purchase RequirementQuestions are frequently asked concerning buildings that are located onground that is shown as being in a special flood hazard area, but thatis actually above the 100 year flood level. As noted above, under SectionA 4., there are procedures under which a Letter of Map Amendment or a Letterof Map Revision can be obtained which will take the particular portionof real property and the improvements thereon out of the special floodhazard area. However, it is important to keep in mind that until a propertyowner has received a Letter of Map Amendment or a Letter of Map Revision,removing the improved real property from the special flood hazard area,Federal agencies (as well as lenders regulated by Federal Instrumentalities)must rely only upon flood hazard boundary maps and flood insurance ratemaps.Thus, if a building is shown as being in a special flood hazard area, thepurchase requirements of the 1973 Act apply. When the property owner obtainsa Letter of Map Amendment of Letter or Map Revision, he may submit theletter to the Federal agency and the Federal Agency may release the propertyowner from the obligation to purchase flood insurance. However, even thougha Federal Agency is not required to compel the purchase of flood insurancewith respect to improved real property that is subject to a letter of mapamendment or map revision, the Agency has the discretionary right to continueto require flood insurance if the Agency chooses to do so. It must alsobe kept in mind that when a property owner with property below the 100year flood level builds an elevated building whose lowest floor is abovethe 100 year flood level, there is no basis for the issuance of eithera letter of map amendment or map revision and the flood insurance purchaserequirement continues to apply. The reason for requiring the insuranceis that the foundation on which the house is elevated is still below thebase flood elevation in the special flood hazard area where it remainsexposed to the action of floodwaters.4. What is ``Financial Assistance''?Federal ``financial assistance'' and ``federal financial assistance'' foracquisition or construction purposes are defined in sections 3 (a)(3) and(4) of the 1973 Act. (42 U.S.C. 4003), ``Financial assistance'' is definedas any ``loan, grant, guaranty, insurance, payment, rebate, subsidy, disasterassistance loan or grant,'' or any other form of ``direct or indirect Federalassistance, other than general or special revenue sharing or formula grantsmade to States.'' and similar forms of direct and indirect assistance fromFederal agencies, such as Federal Housing Administration or Veterans Administrationloans, insurance or guaranties.Federal ``financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes''is defined as ``any form of financial assistance which is intended in wholeor in part for the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, repair, orimprovement of any publicly or privately owned building or mobile home,whether or not the building is enhanced, and for any machinery, equipment,fixtures, and furnishings contained or to be contained therein, and shallinclude the purchase or subsidization of mortgages or mortgage loans.''Federal Agencies, such as the Federal Housing Administration, the VeteransAdministration and the Small Business Administration and the Federal NationalMortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation(FHLMC), the latter two having been specifically included in the definitioncontained in section 3(a)(2) of the 1973 Act, are forbidden by the Actfrom approving any financial assistance in the form of a loan or guarantyof a loan in the case of a building to which such financial assistancerelates which is located in a special flood hazard area unless flood insurancehas been purchased to protect that building against the peril of flooding,thereby protecting the interests of the Federal entity against the consequencesof flood damage to the property.The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan MortgageCorporation of the Department of Housing and Urban Development have interpretedthe term financial assistance to include their purchase of mortgage loansfrom lending institutions and include in their definition of hazard insurance,the peril of flood. It should be noted that the servicing guidelines ofFNMA and FHLMC require that the current servicer of loans sold to thoseagencies assume responsibility for flood insurance renewals. The term Federalfinancial assistance includes loans, grants, guarantees and similar formsof direct and indirect assistance from Federal agencies such as HUD, theFederal Housing Administration (FHA) and the SBA.The 1973 Act applies and thus restricts flood related Federal financialassistance pursuant to the Disaster Relief Act of 1974. However, the currentdefinition of financial assistance contained in section 3(a)(4) of the1973 Act does not apply to and, therefore, does not restrict assistancefor disasters that are not related to flooding.5. How Much Flood Insurance is Available?

How much Flood Insurance Must be Purchased?In addressing the question of how much insurance must be purchased, section102(a) of the 1973 Act prohibits the providing of financial assistance``unless the building or mobile home and any personal property to whichsuch financial assistance relates is, during the anticipated economic oruseful life of the project, covered by flood insurance in an amount atleast equal to its development or project cost (less estimated land cost)or to the maximum limit of coverage made available with respect to theparticular type of property under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968,whichever is less; <T3>Provided, </T3>That if the financial assistance provided is in theform of a loan or an insurance or guaranty of a loan, the amount of floodinsurance required need not exceed the outstanding principal balance ofthe loan and need not be required beyond the term of the loan''.However, on October 12, 1977 the requirement that insurance be purchasedto ``the maximum limit of coverage made available'' under the 1968 Actwas revised and made subject to a statutory cap by section 1306(b)(6) ofthe National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, (42 U.S.C. 4013(b)(6)), whichstates:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * the Flood insurance purchase requirements of Section 102 ofthe Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 do not apply to the additionalflood insurance limits made available in excess of twice the limits madeavailable under paragraph 1306(b)(1). </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Section 1306(b)(1) authorizes the Federal Insurance Administrationto make available under the lower limits of the Emergency Program $35,000of coverage for any single family dwelling and $100,000 for any residentialstructure containing more than one dwelling unit. (In the States of Alaskaand Hawaii and in the Virgin Islands and Guam the figures are $50,000 and$150,000). Section 1306(b)(1) makes available $100,000 for commercial structures.Thus the maximum cap on the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirementsprovided by section 1306(b)(6) is two times these amounts, namely, $70,000for single family dwellings, and $200,00 for other structures.7. Are the Amounts of Flood Insurance That Must Be Purchased Always theSame, Regardless of Which Federal Agency or Instrumentality Is Responsiblefor Enforcing the Flood Insurance Purchase Requirement?In the exercise of its statutory responsibilities the Small Business Administrationhas made an interpretation of the statutory provisions cited above andrequires insurance up to the value of a property, or the maximum amountof insurance that can be purchased, whichever is less, regardless of theactual amount of the loan. In this way the borrower becomes more fullyprotected against the peril of flooding. While the Act does not requireinsurance to value, a practice normal in property insurance, neither doesit prohibit it, and SBA has used its authority to align the treatment offlood insurance with the standard treatment of other hazard insurance.The basic amounts of insurance required by statute are discussed abovein Section C 5. of these guidelines. Some of the Federal agencies, however,such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), have adopteddifferent requirements to protect their interests. The FNMA requires, ``theamount of flood insurance to be equal to the lesser of 100% of the insurablevalue of the (condominium) facilities or the maximum coverage availableunder the appropriate National Flood Insurance Administration program ** *.'' Thus, for a lender to be absolutely sure that it is complying withthe specific requirements of the Federal agency that regulates, supervisesor insures that institution, it should carefully review the requirementsof such agencies or Instrumentalities and not rely solely on these guidelines.In those cases where the amount of the loan or the insurable value of theproperty exceeds the statutorily required amount of flood insurance, itwould seem to be a wise business practice to encourage the purchase ofenough flood insurance to protect the interests of both the mortgagor andthe mortgagee, to the extent that such interests can be protected, by thecoverages under the NFIP.8. Restriction on Federal Financial Assistance by Federal Officers andAgencies in Communities that are not participating in the National FloodInsurance ProgramSection 202(a) of the 1973 Act (42 U.S.C. 4106(a)) addresses the responsibilityof Federal officers and agencies with respect to federal financial assistancein areas of special flood hazard of communities that are not participatingin the National Flood Insurance Program and in which flood insurance isnot available. In order to prevent the Federal government from being financiallyexposed to potential loss as a result of flood damage to uninsured buildingslocated in areas of special flood hazard, Federal officers and agenciesare specifically prohibited by section 202(a) from providing financialassistance for acquisition or construction purposes, for use in areas ofspecial flood hazard if the community is not participating in the NFIP.Section 202(a), read by itself, has a very broad scope, for its prohibitionrefers to any assistance for acquisition or construction purposes thatwould be used in any special flood hazard area. However, read in conjunctionwith the definition of financial assistance contained in paragraph (4)of section 3 of the 1973 Act, as discussed above, it becomes clear thatsection 202(a) limits financial assistance to ``financial assistance whichis intended in whole or in part for the acquisition, construction, reconstruction,repair, or improvement of any publicly or privately owned building or mobilehome, and for any machinery, equipment, fixtures, and furnishings containedor to be contained therein''.Thus, for example, section 202(a) does not prevent financial assistancefor the construction of roads and bridges in special flood hazard areasof non participating communities. But it does prohibit assistance for constructingany building. This prohibition applies even if the building would not havebeen eligible for flood insurance had it been located in a participatingcommunity, as in the case of a building that is partially underground andused as a pumping station in a sewer system. The prohibition against providingfinancial assistance in non participating communities, therefore, is basednot so much upon the fact that the protection of NFIP flood insurance isnot available in non participating communities as it is to the fact thatthe community has not agreed to mitigate the hazard of flooding throughfloodplain management.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Application of the 1973 Act to Federal Instrumentalities and toPrivate Lenders Who are Subject to Their Jurisdiction</ITAG>Of special significance to Federal Instrumentalities and the lenders regulatedby, or whose deposits are insured by, the Instrumentalities is the secondarea to which the 1973 Act applies in sections 102(b) and 202(b), whichaddress conventional loans by such lenders, as distinguished from Federalfinancial assistance.1. In Communities That are Participating in the National Flood InsuranceProgram and Where Federal Flood Insurance can Therefore be Made Available<ITAG tagnum="81">(a) Instrumentalities Defined</ITAG>The term ``Federal Instrumentality'' is defined in section 3(a)(5) of the1973 Act (42 U.S.C. 4003(a)(5)), as the ``Board of Governors of the FederalReserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Comptrollerof the Currency, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the Federal Savingsand Loan Insurance Corporation, and the National Credit Union Administration.''<ITAG tagnum="81">(b) Legislative Purpose and Specific Mandate  </ITAG>The purpose behind these Sections is seen in the Congressional findingin section 2(a)(4) of the 1973 Act that ``Federal Instrumentalities insureor otherwise provide financial protection to banking and credit institutionswhose assets include a substantial number of mortgage loans and other indebtednesssecured by property exposed to loss and damage from floods and mudslides''.As noted above, the Act does not, by itself, require or prohibit activitieson the part of lenders. Section 102(b) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 4012a(b))directs the Federal Instrumentalities to adopt regulations requiring lenderssubject to their jurisdiction to compel borrowers to purchase flood insuranceprotecting any ``improved real estate or mobile home'' located in a specialflood hazard area in a community that is eligible for the purchase of NationalFlood Insurance, if the building, mobile home, and any personal propertysecuring such loan, is to be the security for the loan. (The requirementonly applies if the particular property is eligible for flood insuranceunder the rules of the NFIP.)  <ITAG tagnum="81">(c) How Much Insurance Must be Purchased and for How Long Must itbe in Force, and to What Transactions Does the Requirement Apply?  </ITAG>The Act requires that ``the building or mobile home and any personal propertysecuring the loan'' be covered ``for the term of the loan by flood insurancein an amount at least equal to the outstanding principal balance of theloan, or to the maximum limit of coverage made available with respect tothe particular type of property under the Act, whichever is less''. However,as noted above, on October 12, 1977, the requirement that insurance bepurchased to ``the maximum limit of coverage made available'' under the1968 Act was revised by section 1306(b)(6) of the National Flood InsuranceAct of 1968, (42 U.S.C. 4013(b)(6)), and made subject to a statutory capof twice the limits made available under paragraph 1306(b)(1).  The specfiic language of the Act describes very broadly the transactionsthat come within the purchase provisions and includes instances in whichlenders ``make, increase, extend, or renew any loan secured by improvedreal property or a mobile home located or to be located'' in a specialflood hazard area of a community ``in which flood insurance has been madeavailable under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968''. This also includessuch transactions as second mortgages and home equity loans.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> In all of these instances, lenders should be aware that,subject to available policy limits, they have the discretion to requirehigher amounts of coverage than required by law if they consider it necessaryto protect the full amount of their interests, as well as those of theborrowers.  </ITAG>2. In Portions of Participating Communities That Have Been Designated bythe Department of the Interior as Undeveloped Areas Under The Coastal BarrierResources Act (COBRA)  While ordinarily almost any building in a community that is participatingin the NFIP is eligible for flood insurance, there is one significant situationin which Congress has chosen to deny residents of a participating communityeligibility for flood insurance. The Coastal Barrier Resources Act (COBRA),Pub. L. 97-348, was adopted by Congress in October of 1982 to amend theNational Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, by adding section 1321(42 U.S.C. 4028). Section 1321 prohibits the NFIP from providing floodinsurance protection for structures built or substantially improved afterOctober 1, 1983, in any of the areas designated by the Department of theInterior as an undeveloped coastal barrier.  Buildings already located in the designated areas and walled or roofedprior to October 1, 1983 remain eligible for coverage. If a building builtin a designated area prior to October 1, 1983 sustains major damage asa result of a fire, hurricane or other causes, the restored structure wouldnot be eligible for flood insurance coverage. Major damage is consideredto be damage in an amount of 50% or more of the structure's pre-damagefair market value. Similarly, improvements to a structure built prior toOctober 1, 1983, on a designated undeveloped coastal barrier area whichtotal 50% or more of the structure's pre-improvement fair market valuewould eliminate the structure's eligibility for coverage under the NFIP.Only the undeveloped coastal barrier portion of each community is affectedby COBRA's insurance limitation. The remainder of the participating communityremains eligible under the NFIP for flood insurance coverage for new andexisting construction.  The Department of the Interior was assigned the task of determining whichof the coastal areas were undeveloped coastal barriers and of submittinga list to the Congress. The final Congressional designation included 187undeveloped portions of 134 coastal communities. Additional areas are currentlyunder consideration for inclusion in the Coastal Barrier Resources System.The question as to whether any requirements are placed upon lenders whowish to make conventional loans with respect to uninsurable property onan undeveloped coastal barrier in a special flood hazard area of a participatingcommunity is specifically answered by section 1321 of the 1968 Act, (42U.S.C. 4028). That section provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">A federally insured financial institution may make loans secured bystructures which are not eligible for flood insurance under this titleby reason of subsection (a).</ITAG>Thus, while lenders would still have to notify borrowers that the propertywas in a special flood hazard area, as required by Section 1364 of the1968 Act, the unavailability of flood insurance does not prevent the makingof the conventional loan. However, the lender would be well advised toassess the flood risk at the site and make a decision on granting the loanbased on that assessment.  3. In Communities That are Participating in the NFIP_Property Subject toLetters of Map Amendment or Map Revision  As noted above, there are procedures under which a Letter of Map Amendmentor a Letter of Map Revision can be obtained which will take the particularportion of real property, and the improvements thereon, out of the specialflood hazard area. However, it is important to keep in mind that untila property owner has received a Letter of Map Amendment or Letter of MapRevision, the lender must rely upon flood hazard boundary and flood insurancerate maps. If a particular piece of property is shown as being in a specialflood hazard area, the lender is bound by the information and must applythe insurance purchase requirements of the 1973 Act in accordance withthe map.  However, even though a lender is not required to compel the purchase offlood insurance with respect to improved real property that is subjectto a letter of map amendment or map revision, the lender has the discretionaryright to continue to require floor insurance if the lender chooses to doso. When a property owner with property below the 100 year flood levelbuilds an elevated building whose lowest floor is above the 100 year floodlevel, there is no basis for the insurance of either a letter of map amendmentor map revision and the flood insurance purchase requirement continuesto apply, because the foundations supporting the elevated building in thespecial flood hazard area is still below the base flood elevation whereit is exposed to the action of the water. However, premium levels may reflectreduced exposure to damage.4. In Communities That are not Participating in the National Flood InsuranceProgram It is important to note that while Federal officers and agencies are stillprohibited by section 202 (a) of the 1973 Act, (42 U.S.C. 4106(a)) fromproviding financial assistance with respect to improved real property inareas of flood hazard in communities that are not participating in theNFIP and in which the sale of National Flood Insurance is not authorized,the making of conventional loans in such communities by private lendersbecame permissible in 1977. <ITAG tagnum="81">(a) What is a Conventional Loan? </ITAG>A conventional loan is a loan by a private lender, as distinguished froma loan by a Federal government agency, that is not secured, insured orguaranteed by a Federal government agency. Such a loan, even when madeby a lender that is regulated by or has its deposits insured by a FederalFinancial Regulatory Agency (Federal Instrumentality), remains a conventionalloan because the loan itself is not secured, insured or guaranteed by aFederal government agency. <ITAG tagnum="81">(b) Authority for Lenders to Make Conventional Loans in Special FloodHazard Areas of Non Participating Communities. </ITAG>An amendment to the 1973 Act (frequently referred to as ``The EagletonAmendment'' contained in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1977(Pub. L. 95-128), deleted from the Act its original section 202(b) (42U.S.C. 4106(b)) requirement that Federal Instrumentalities issue regulationsprohibiting lenders from making conventional loans with respect to propertyin non participating communities. The original prohibition was replacedby a new section 202(b) which substituted in its place a notification requirement.Consequently, lenders regulated by, or whose deposits are insured by FederalInstrumentalities may make conventional loans secured by mortgages on improvedreal property and mobile homes in areas of special flood hazard in communitiesthat are not participating in the NFIP. They may do so notwithstandingthe fact that such property is not eligible for the purchase of NationalFlood Insurance, and, thus, the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirementdoes not apply with respect to such loans. However, lenders should carefullyevaluate the underwriting risk involved in making such loans. <ITAG tagnum="81">(c) Requirements for Notification to the Borrower if Improved RealProperty That is the Security for the Loan is in a Special Flood HazardArea </ITAG>The notice requirements, by their specific language, apply only when improvedreal property is the security for a loan. The requirements do not applyto unsecured loans, or to loans secured by improved real property thatis not located in a special flood hazard area. While the Housing and CommunityDevelopment Act of 1977 removed the prohibition against making conventionalloans in non participating communities, the ``notice'' provision, whichis the current section 202(b) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973,requires the Instrumentalities to compel lenders to notify borrowers asto whether Federal Disaster Relief will be available to the property inthe event of a disaster caused by flood. For the convenience of lenders,FIA has drafted a notice form, FEMA Form 81-2.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6718-01-M002 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration(s) 3 359-3 360 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="66">BILLING CODE 6718-01-C</ITAG>   An additional requirement, mandated by section 1364 of the National FloodInsurance Act of 1968, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 4104a), directs the Instrumentalitiesto compel lenders to notify the purchaser or lessee of the improved realproperty or mobile home in writing of the special flood hazard to whichthe property is exposed or obtain satisfactory assurances that the selleror lessor has so notified the purchaser or lessee. These notificationsare to be made ``a reasonable period in advance of the signing of the purchaseagreement, lease, or other documents involved in the transaction''. Consistentwith the recommendation by the Federal Financial Institutions ExaminationCouncil, FIA believes that the ``reasonable time'' requirement is satisfiedif the notices are provided ten days before the closing, or at the timeof commitment if this occurrs less than ten days before the closing.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. Guidelines to an Interpretation of the 1973 Act</ITAG>The paragraphs above constitute a descriptive analysis of the provisionsof the 1973 Act. What follows is an analysis of some of the issues thathave arisen under the Act based upon the experience that the Federal InsuranceAdministration has gathered over the past twenty years and the discussionswe have had with representatives of Federal agencies and Instrumentalities.The views expressed below represent our best effort toward providing guidanceand we welcome the views of other Federal agencies and the Federal Instrumentalitieson these subjects.1. What is the Standard by Which a Lender Should Be Judged in Consideringits Determination as to Whether a Structure Is or Is Not in an Area ofSpecial Flood Hazard?<ITAG tagnum="81">(a) Significance of the Location of the Structure</ITAG>As pointed out above, the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirementsof the 1973 Act apply only where improved real property, i.e., a structure,is located in a special flood hazard area in a community that is participatingin the National Flood Insurance Program. Such a structure must be insurableunder the NFIP, and under NFIP rules an insurable ``structure'' means anywalled and roofed improvement predominately above ground). Even thougha portion of real property on which a structure is located may lie withinan area of special flood hazard, the purchase and notice requirements ofthe 1973 Act do not apply unless the structure itself, or some part ofthe structure is in the special flood hazard area. Prudence may suggestthe wisdom of the lender's choosing as a matter of its own discretion torequire the purchase of flood insurance where the distance from the structureto the edge of the special flood hazard area is minimal, but such a decisionis not compelled by the 1973 Act.<ITAG tagnum="81">(b) Examination of the Map</ITAG>In order to determine whether a structure is located in an area of specialflood hazard it is necessary to examine the location of the structure inrelationship to the areas of special flood hazard shown on Flood HazardBoundary Maps or Flood Insurance Rate Maps. However, despite FEMA's effortsto make the maps as useful as possible, the descriptions of special floodhazard areas contained in some maps may, in some instances, not be clearenough to permit lenders to decide with certainty and precision whetheror not property which is the security for a loan or which is the subjectof financial assistance is located in such an area. It is for this reasonthat FEMA has recommended a ``Good Faith Standard''.<ITAG tagnum="81">(c) The ``Good Faith Standard''</ITAG>As in its earlier editions of these Guidelines, FIA recommends that forthe purposes of the 1973 Act, a lender's decision, made in the exerciseof due diligence and good faith as to the location of a property whichis the subject of a loan on such a map, be considered final and sufficientto comply with the 1973 Act. In such instances, it FIA's view that wherea good faith finding has been made by a lender or its agent, acting pursuantto the requirements of the 1973 Act, that the property is outside the specialflood hazard area, such finding as to the location of the property shouldbe considered final with respect to such property regardless of any changeof ownership of the property or status of the loan. In FIA's view, underthe 1973 Act, subsequent revision of the map would not necessitate themaking of a new determination or require the lender to go back and compelthe borrower to purchase flood insurance, even if the new map clearly showedthe structure to be in a special flood hazard area. However, prudence mightsuggest the desirability of so doing.However, if there should be any subsequent making, increasing, extension,or renewal of a loan with respect to which the property is subject, inFIA's view, the original finding should remain final only if the map uponwhich the original finding was based was still in effect and unrevisedas to the property in question. Thus, if a map was subsequently revised,any subsequent making, increasing, extension, or renewal of the loan shouldtake into account the new map, and a new determination should be made atthat time as to whether flood insurance must be required for the subsequenttransaction.<ITAG tagnum="81">(d) Lenders' Reliance Upon Assistance</ITAG>Lenders may reasonably seek assistance from firms or individuals, includingmap determination service organizations, that have demonstrated their knowledgeconcerning flood maps, and reasonable reliance upon such guidance in themaking of a lender's determination should, for most practical purposes,be regarded as consistent with due diligence and good faith. In many instancesCommunity officials and appraisers may be a helpful and knowledgeable resource.FIA does not believe that there would be reason for objection to havingthe costs passed on to borrowers if permitted by the loan contract andapplicable State and Federal law.<ITAG tagnum="81">(e) Who Must Make Determinations?</ITAG>An insurance company, insurance agent or appraiser is under no statutoryor regulatory duty to make determinations as to whether a structure isexempt from the flood insurance purchase requirement and any ``determination''made by them does not alter the regulatory responsibility of the lenderto make such determinations. Circumstances could be contemplated in whichan insurance company, insurance agent or appraiser might have expertisethat a lender would find helpful and persuasive, but whatever determinationis made remains the full responsibility of the lender.<ITAG tagnum="81">(f) What is Determined?</ITAG>The determinations referred to above address only the question as to whetherthe location of a particular structure is within the area on a map whichis designated by the Federal Insurance Administrator as being a specialflood hazard area (SFHA), which is the area inundated by a flood havinga one percent chance of annual occurrence (Zones A, AE, A1-A-30, AH, AO,V, VE, V1-30). Any question concerning the correctness of the map or whetherthe exact location of the structure in the special flood hazard area shouldhave been designated by the FIA as being in a SFHA is totally beyond theauthority of the lender.Only the Federal Insurance Administration can amend an official map toremove or add a particular property location from a designated SFHA bya Letter of Map Amendment, or revise a map by a Letter of Map Revisionto change the special flood hazard area or revise the elevations on a map.<ITAG tagnum="81">(g) How to Record that a Determination was Made?</ITAG>FEMA Forms 81-3 and 81-2 were developed by FIA to help lenders notify borrowersof their status under the NFIP maps and to enable them to notify borrowersof any changes in NFIP maps which may have altered the boundaries of specialflood hazard areas in such a way as to cause a borrower's structure tono longer be located in an area of special flood hazard. These noticescreate a record showing that the lender has made a determination or a redeterminationas to the status of the borrower's structure and when placed in the filesof the lender demonstrate to examiners of Federal Instrumentalities thatthere is a proper basis for a borrower to have been required to purchaseflood insurance, or permitted not to purchase, or to drop a flood insurancepolicy after a map revision. Additionally, many lenders, as well as theFederal agencies, such as FNMA, Freddie Mac, FMHA, HUD and VA, use theUniform Residential Appraisal Report form which contains, amongst otherthings, questions on the location of a property relative to flood hazardareas. When a determination is made that a structure is not in a specialflood hazard area, evidence should be recorded showing, at the least, themap panel used, the date and number of the map, the name of the community,the zone in which the property is located, and the address of the structure.A photocopy of the official map, marked to show the location of the propertywould provide a convenient record.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6718-01-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 3 366</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6718-01-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">(h) The Ultimate Responsibility of the Lender</ITAG>But, in all these situations the lender, using such evidence as is reasonable,must take the responsibility for making determinations and redeterminations,regardless of whether the lender actually makes the determination or hiressomeone else to do it. Because it is the lender that requires the purchaseof flood insurance, only the lender can make a determination or a redetermination,and only the signature of a representative or duly authorized agent ofthe lender on Form 81-2 and 81-3 can make the form take on any significancein terms of establishing the status of the improved real property and providingthe lender with a record of the determination or redetermination.2. Should the Amount of Insurance Required Reflect the Value of Land?<ITAG tagnum="81">(a) The 1973 Act Refers to Buildings and Mobile Homes</ITAG>Section 102(a) of the 1973 Act conditions the granting of financial assistanceby Federal officers and agencies upon there being flood insurance coveragewith respect to ``the building or mobile home and any personal propertyto which such financial assistance relates'' in an amount at least equalto ``its development cost (less estimated land cost)''. Thus this sectionof the statute clearly expresses the intent of Congress that the amountof insurance be related only to the cost of the building and not includethe cost of the land.Section 102(b) describes the flood insurance purchase requirement for lendersmaking conventional loans in terms of ``improved real estate or a mobilehome located or to be located'' in a special flood hazard area and usesthe language similar to that in section 102(a), conditioning the makingof a loan in a participating community upon there being flood insurancecovering ``the building or mobile home and any personal property securingsuch loan''.This reference to ``buildings and mobile homes'' is consistent with thefact that the National Flood Insurance Program insures only buildings,including manufactured homes (mobile homes), and does not insure land.Thus improved real estate, as used in section 102(b) of the 1973 Act meansland with a building on it and the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirementapplies only to the buildings and manufactured homes which constitute theimprovements on the land.<ITAG tagnum="81">(b) What the NFIP Policy Covers</ITAG>Moreover, it should be kept in mind that the NFIP policy does not provideinsurance coverage for losses in excess of the value of a structure. Thedetermination of whether the loss will be paid on the basis of replacementvalue or actual cash value depends upon whether the residence is primary,and whether the insured has purchased insurance of up to at least 80% ofthe replacement cost of the structure. Under the NFIP policy, ``replacementvalue'' means that the coverage is intended to include the full cost ofrepair or replacement without deduction for depreciation. The term ``actualcash value'' means that the coverage is intended to include repair or replacementless depreciation. A dwelling which is the principal residence of an insuredmay be insured for its replacement cost value, but secondary residences,condominium units in vertical high rise buildings and commercial buildingsmay be insured only for their actual cash value.In light of the above, in requiring the purchase of flood insurance thelender should first calculate the amount of the loan, or the maximum amountof insurance available under the National Flood Insurance Program, whicheveris less. Having developed that figure, the lender may, depending upon itsview of the flood risk, take into account the statutory ``cap'' of section1306(b)(6), which, for example, limits the mandatory purchase to $70,000for single family residential structures. Then, the value of the land shouldbe subtracted from the overall value of the property in reaching a determinationas to the value of the improved property, ie, the structure, that is tobe insured. This is especially significant in cases where the proposedloan clearly exceeds the value of the insurable buildings. In instanceswhere the lender does not take into account separate valuations of land,which is not insurable under the NFIP, and improvements, which are insurable,the insured may, unfortunately, be paying for coverage that is in excessof the amount that the NFIP will pay in the event of a loss. In FIA's view,lenders should avoid creating such a situation.<ITAG tagnum="81">(c) What If the Loan Is Secured Only by Land Upon Which There AreNo Structures?</ITAG>If a lender makes a loan which does not give the lender a lien on any landupon which there is a building, i.e., improved real property, no floodinsurance purchase requirement applies. Thus, if a lender can separatehis loan so as to become the holder of a mortgage that is secured by landalone, no flood insurance purchase requirement applies because the NFIPdoes not insure land, and the 1973 Act does not address mortgages securedby land alone.<ITAG tagnum="81">(d) What If a Detached Garage of a Residential Property, to Which10% of the Principal Structure's Insurance Is Applicable, Is In the SpecialFlood Hazard Area, While the Principal Structure Is Outside of the SpecialFlood Hazard Area?</ITAG>Flood insurance on the principal structure would not be required becauseof its location outside the special flood hazard area. But if the detachedgarage is part of the security for the loan, flood insurance on the garagewould be required and could be purchased through a separate policy on theGeneral Property Form, covering just the garage. However, if the valueof the principal structure is sufficient to serve as security for the loan,the requirement would not apply if the lender was willing to delete thegarage from the description of improved real property securing the loan.In agreeing to do this, a prudent lender would consider the value of thegarage and the likely degree of its exposure to damage in the event offlooding, as well as whether the close proximity of the house to the specialflood hazard area raised questions as to the safety of the house, itself.If, instead of a detached garage in the special flood hazard area, therewas a tool shed or similar shack with no foundation and not attached tothe land, such property would not be insurable under the NFIP. Being morein the nature of personalty as opposed to realty, it would not be partof the security for the loan, and no flood insurance would be required.3. What is the Impact of the Insurance Purchase Requirement if Improvementson the Real Property are of Nominal Value, and the Purpose of the LoanTransaction is to Facilitate the Purchase of Land for Subsequent Development?<ITAG tagnum="81">(a) Surplus Buildings of Nominal Value on Land Purchased for Development</ITAG>Instances arise when real estate is purchased for the purpose of developmentand the presence of a structure on the land is not a factor in the purchaseof the land. In fact, in many situations, the developer's plan may callfor the structure to be demolished as soon as development occurs. But,because the 1973 Act speaks of ``improved real estate'' in triggering themandatory flood insurance purchase requirement, questions are frequentlyasked as to whether flood insurance must be required in such situations.It is FIA's view that the answers to such questions should be approachedthrough a view of the purposes for which the purchase requirements of the1973 Act were adopted, namely to protect lenders and the Federal resourcesagainst potential losses resulting from unsecured loans, and to protectunwary borrowers against financial losses resulting from uninsured buildings.In these situations the acquisition of the building is not the primarypurpose behind the purchase of the land, and frequently the structure isnot intended to remain in place when the property is developed. If thevalue of the building was less than the NFIP $500 deductible, clearly therewould be no requirement for the purchase of flood insurance. But, evenif the value exceeded $500, given the fact that the transaction involvesprimarily land, this would be an appropriate situation for wording themortgage so as specifically exclude such a building as part of the securityfor the loan. In this kind of situation where the structure is not beingused for residential or commercial purposes and where there is no intentto improve it or use it for such purposes, and where the loan is adequatelysecured without including the building, in FIA's view, the flood insurancepurchase requirement would not apply.<ITAG tagnum="81">(b) What If There Is a Structure In a Special Flood Hazard Area WhichIs Being Used for Residential or Commercial Purposes on Land Whose ValueAlone Would be Sufficient to Secure the Loan Without Regard to the Valueof the Building?</ITAG>The 1973 Act does not give a lender the option of enabling the borrowerto avoid the purchase of flood insurance, even though the land may be sovaluable that it would provide more than adequate security for the amountof the loan, without taking into account the value of the building on theland. If the land has a building upon it, and the lender has a securityinterest in that building, the Act requires the lender to require the purchaseof flood insurance to protect its security interest. In so doing, the lenderis also protecting the government's interests by preserving the assetsof agencies which insure the lender's deposits.<ITAG tagnum="81">(c) NFIP Deductibles and Definition of Structure</ITAG>It should be kept in mind that the NFIP has a minimum $500 deductible,which means that if the actual cash value of a structure, taking into accountdepreciation, did not exceed $500, the structure would for practical purposesbe uninsurable because there could never be any claim payment in the eventof flood damage. It should also be kept in mind that the NFIP insures onlywalled and roofed structures which are principally above ground and arepermanently affixed to sites. Also eligible are silos and grain storagebuildings, and buildings in the course of construction, i.e. under construction,but before they have become walled and roofed. Buildings are walled androofed when they have two or more rigid external walls in place and areroofed and adequately anchored so that they will resist flotation, collapseand lateral movement. The Flood Insurance Manual lists as ineligible forinsurance coverage gazebos, pavilions, pole barns, pumping stations, andstorage tanks, and thus, the presence of such structures would not giverise to any question as to the purchase of flood insurance.<ITAG tagnum="81">(d) Buildings in the Course of Construction</ITAG>However, when a structure is to be built which when completed will be awalled and roofed structure that will be eligible for coverage, flood insurancemust be purchased. Therefore, where a development loan is made for thepurpose of constructing insurable improvements on land, flood insurancecoverage must be purchased to keep pace with the new construction. Theonly practical way of implementing the flood insurance coverage is to requirethe purchase of the policy at the time that the development loan is madeand requiring that the policy be purchased to cover the eventual valueof the property to be constructed.Since October 1, 1986, buildings that are in the course of constructionbut have yet to be walled and roofed are eligible for flood insurance,subject to certain underwriting restrictions. The 1986 regulations andpolicy changes resolved a prior problem which arose out of the fact thelenders had to require the purchase of flood insurance policies that couldnot provide any coverage until a future date when the building would beconsidered to be walled and roofed. This significant change recognizesthe flood peril faced by a builder during the process of construction andbrings the NFIP more into conformity with the practices of fire insurersby providing insurance coverage that begins during the period of time whenconstruction is taking place. Unless defined stages of development canbe identified, the most practical way of implementing the flood coveragemay be to require the purchase of the policy at the time that the developmentloan is made and funds are disbursed.For new construction in Regular Program communities, where elevation certificatesare required, the certificate and the premium will be based upon an elevationfigure derived from construction drawings. However, the policy will notbe renewed until a new certificate based upon actual construction has beensubmitted. In any event, the point of the 1986 change is that coverageunder the policy becomes available immediately when the construction startsand is not delayed until the building has reached a roofed and walled condition.4. What are the Consequences if a Structure is Located in a Community Thatis Participating in the National Flood Insurance Program, but Flood Insuranceis not Available With Respect to That Particular Structure?It is the view of FIA that in using the words ``the sale of flood insurancehas been made available'' the Congress meant the mandatory flood insurancepurchase requirement of section 102(b) to address the situation where FIA,through the NFIP, offers to sell a flood insurance policy to the ownerof the particular structure that is the subject of the transaction. Wherethe Federal government has chosen to limit the availability of flood insurancein a participating community, the inability of the property owner to purchaseflood insurance does not require a lender to refrain from making a conventionalloan with respect to that property.<ITAG tagnum="81">(a) Coastal Barrier Resources Act</ITAG>There are several reasons why flood insurance might not be available toa particular structure. One of the most significant is the Coastal BarrierResources Act (COBRA), Pub. L. 97-348, mentioned above, which was adoptedby Congress in October of 1982 to reduce or restrict Federal governmentactions that were believed to be encouraging the development of certaincoastal barrier areas, including both islands and mainland property, thatare currently undeveloped. While COBRA does not prevent private financingand development, it limits financial assistance by Federal agencies onundeveloped coastal barriers, except for enumerated situations such asassistance for emergency actions essential to the saving of lives and theprotection of property and the public health and safety. Such emergencyassistance would not include disaster assistance and government loans.<ITAG tagnum="81">(b) Section 1316 of the 1973 Act and Buildings in Violation of Stateor Local Laws</ITAG>Another statutory provision which prohibits the sale of flood insuranceas to particular properties is section 1316 of the 1968 Act (42 U.S.C.4023) which prohibts the sale of new flood insurance for any property whichthe Director finds ``has been declared by a duly constituted State or localzoning authority, or other authorized public body, to be in violation ofState or local laws, regulations, or ordinances which are intended to discourageor otherwise restrict land development or occupany in flood-prone areas.''Questions have arisen as to whether a conventional loan can be made whenthe building is located in a special flood hazard area of a community thatis participating in the NFIP, but where the particular building is noteligible for flood insurance protection because it has been declared tothe in violation of local floodplain management building codes. Under section102(b) of the 1973 Act, which makes the flood insurance purchase requirementapplicable to properties to which flood insurance has been made available,the making of a conventional loan would not be prohibited with respectto a building cited under section 1316 of the 1968 Act. Nevertheless, compliancewith the provision notifying the borrower that the building is in a specialflood hazard area would be especially important. It is important that FederalInstrumentalities and lenders subject to their jurisdiction be aware thatproperties which come under the provisions of section 1316 of the 1968Act because of violations which relate to protection against flooding will,in most cases, be highly susceptible to flood damages, and are a far greaterrisk to the lender than structures that are compliant with floodplain managementordinances.<ITAG tagnum="81">(c) Section 136, as Applicable to Federal Officers and Agencies</ITAG>Questions have arisen as to the applicability of section 1316 to section102(a), which applies to the approval of financial assistance by Federalofficers and agencies. Federal officers and agencies should make theirown determinations as to whether they should approve financial assistancewith respect to a building that the community has declared to be in violationof local ordinances designed to reduce the peril of flood damage to suchbuilding. And in coastal barrier areas they must consider the restrictionsplaced on Federal assistance by COBRA.<ITAG tagnum="81">(d) NFIP Underwriting Restrictions on Eligibility for Flood Insurance</ITAG>In addition to COBRA and section 1316 of the 1968 Act, there are policyprovisions and underwriting rules of the Standard Flood Insurance Policysold under the NFIP which preclude certain properties from eligibilityfor coverage. For example, structures built over water cannot be insuredunder the Program, nor can boat houses. The NFIP coverages also containrestrictions on insurance coverage, such as the protions of homes consistingof finished basements where only enumerated and limited coverage is available.5. The Applicability of the 1973 Act to the Purchase of Mortgages by LendersAmong the Federal Instrumentalities two different views have been expressedon the subject of the appliciability of the Act to transactions involvingthe purchase of mortgages by lenders. The Federal Home Loan Bank Boardhas taken a position which is similar to that expressed by the FederalInsurance Administration in FIA Guidelines dated 1978, and has interpretedthe Act as including not only the origination of mortgage loans, but alsothe purchase of mortgage loan portfolios in the secondary market and participationsthereof. Thus, under this view purchased mortage loans secured by improvedproperty in a SFHA must be covered by flood insurance, where applicable,unless the original loan was made pursuant to a formal loan commitmentissued prior to March 2, 1974.On the other hand, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the FederalReserve Board and the Comptroller of the Currency have interpreted theAct to apply only to the origination of mortgage loans and not the purchaseof mortgage loans in the secondary market. Lenders should, therefore, followthe interpretations of the particular Federal Instrumentality to whoseexaminations they are subject for authoritative guidance. In FIA's view,the term ``where applicable'', as used in connection with the positionthat the statute does apply to the purchase of mortgages, means that sucha requirement pertains only to mortgage loans involving improved real propertyin areas of special flood hazard in communities participating in the NationalFlood Insurance Program, and in which flood insurance is thereby availablethrough the NFIP.6. Acceptance of Private Flood Insurance Policies To Meet Statutory Requirementand the Acceptance of NFIP ``Write Your Own Policies''FIA would welcome the availability of adequate flood insurance from theprivate insurance market. Had adequate and assured flood insurance protectionbeen available through the private insurance market in 1968, the NFIP mightnot have been necessary. To give the public the benefits of the marketingand servicing expertise of the private insurance industry, FIA has since1983 been making flood insurance available through the NFIP ``Write YourOwn'' Program (WYO) which enables the public to purchase the same NFIPcoverage from private companies that have agreed to enter into agreementswith FIA. The coverage, eligibility and premiums are the same on WYO policiesas in the case of policies that are issued directly by the FIA throughits servicing company. The FIA has guaranteed that in the event that anyWYO company is required by State regulatory authorities to cease writinginsurance and is unable to pay flood insurance claims under any WYO policy,FIA will assume all obligations for the payment of covered claims underthat policy. Thus, lenders and insureds should not hesitate to accept NFIPpolicies written either directly by FIA or through a WYO company.In the event of a submission of a flood insurance policy that is not issuedby the NFIP through FIA or a WYO company, FIA believes that the followingcriteria should be met with respect to any flood insurance policy submittedto a lending institution or a Federal agency in purported satisfactionof the insurance purchase requirements of the 1973 Act.(a) The insurer should be licensed to do business in the jurisdiction wherethe property is located, by the Insurance Department of that jurisdiction,except as indicated in (b) below.(b) In the case of a non-residential commercial property insured pursuantto a policy of difference in conditions, multiple peril, all risk, or otherblanket coverage, it should be sufficient if the insurer is recognized,or not disapproved, as a surplus lines insurer by the Insurance Departmentof the jurisdiction where the property is located.(c) The flood insurance policy issued by the insurer should include anendorsement which requires that the insurer give 30 days written noticeof cancellation or non-renewal to the insured with respect to the floodinsurance coverage and that to be effective such notice must be mailedto both the insured and the lender or Federal agency and must include informationas to the availability of flood insurance coverage under the NFIP.(d) The policy should guarantee that the flood insurance coverage, consideringboth deductibles and exclusions or conditions offered by the insurer, isat least as broad as the coverage by the NFIP policies.(e) Lenders should satisfy themselves that a mortgage interest clause similarto that contained in NFIP policies is contained in the policy.In the opinion of the FIA, an insurance policy that meets all of the abovecriteria meets the insurance purchase requirements of section 102 of the1973 Act. To the extent that the policy differs from the FIA policy, thedifferences should be carefully examined before consideration is givento acceptance of the policy as sufficient protection under the 1973 Act.7. Lenders' Remedies in the Event of Prior Failure to Require Flood InsuranceThe history of the NFIP since the enactment of the 1973 Act indicates thatlenders have not consistently required the purchase and renewal of floodinsurance policies as required by regulations issued by Federal Instrumentalitiespursuant to the 1973 Act. Questions arise as to what steps are availablefor lenders whose attention has been directed to the situation at a latertime. The issue has been raised to FIA with growing frequency that becauseof the rapid turnover of the servicing of mortgages, some loan originatorsmay be paying little or no attention to the flood insurance purchase requirementbecause the servicing is sold so quickly.This could result in no flood coverage being written to protect the interestsof either the mortgagor or the mortgagee. It also means that any subsequentservicer of that loan would be provided with no basis upon which it canknow that the property is located in the floodplain and therefore maintainthe flood insurance coverage. Also when a flood insurance policy is writtenin conjunction with a closing, FIA fears that subsequent servicers maynot be notifying the insurance agent who originally wrote that policy ofthe change in mortgagee (or servicer) to enable renewal and/or cancellationnotices to be sent to the proper party (lender) servicing the loan. Thus,in the case where the insurance payments were not escrowed, the mortgageservicer would have no way of knowing whether or not the borrower continuedto renew the policy or allowed it to lapse.Lenders selling mortgages in the secondary market to FNMA, FHLMA or GNMA,(Federal Agencies under the 1973 Act) should be aware that those Agencieswill be requiring that the security for such mortgages in special floodhazard areas be protected by flood insurance. The remedies available tothe lenders will vary depending upon the language in the loan agreements.Most mortgages require that the borrower obtain and maintain hazard insurance.This provision was originally developed with a view to fire insurance ata time when flood insurance was not available. But in light of the factthat flood insurance under the NFIP has been offered for twenty years,the term ``hazard insurance'' should be broad enough to include flood insurance.On the basis of discussions FIA has had with Federal Instrumentalitiesand the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, it is FEMA'sview that if the loan agreement is specific in requiring hazard insurance,that provision, especially when coupled with the regulatory obligationupon the lender to require the borrower to purchase flood insurance, givesthe lender ample authority to require the borrower to purchase flood insurance,even at a date subsequent to the date on which the loan was initiated.On the basis of these same discussions, FEMA believes that if the borrowerrefused to purchase flood insurace, the bank would be justified in purchasingthe insurance for the borrower and charging the borrower for the cost.In the case of loans that are being paid off through escrow agreements,this process would be greatly facilitated. For new construction in RegularProgram communities, NFIP rules require the submission of an elevationcertificate with the application, and that certificate is in FEMA's viewa cost of the procurement of flood insurance.FIA's same discussions lead FEMA to conclude that where appraisal proceduresinclude an analysis as to whether the improved real estate is in a specialflood hazard area, the costs attributable to that process would be properexpenses in connection with the costs of appraisal. FIA is in the courseof exploring the feasibility of a forced placement capability for floodinsurance to facilitate the prompt procurement of flood insurance whenthere is doubt that flood insurance has been purchased or kept in forceby the borrower.8. Home Equity Loans Under the 1973 ActThe currently popular Home Equity Loans are clearly secured loans of thekind covered under the 1973 Act and trigger the flood insurance purchaserequirement. The simplest way in which a lender could protect its interestsand comply with the purchase requirements would be to consider that whenthe bank has filed its lien, based on the signing of the Home Equity Loanagreement, the purchase of insurance becomes mandatory to the amount ofthe loan authority (subject to the limit on insurance available and theinsurance requirement cap) if the improved real property is located ina special flood hazard area of a participating community. This procedurewould be similar in concept to the way in which many mortgage lenders havetypically handled their property insurance requirements for building constructionloans prior to the existence of an actual insurable building.However, the difficulty with this solution lies in the fact that the HomeEquity Loan is more like an approved line of credit to be utilized in thefuture. A borrower could argue that so long as the lender has not paidout any money, there is no flood exposure and consequently no flood insurancepurchase requirement. But to impose the requirement each time that a borrowerdrew a check on his loan authority might be administratively difficult.An alternative, therefore, might be for the lender to examine its bookseach calendar year, and when a loan has actually been made under the HomeEquity loan authority, require flood insurance to protect that loan onthe basis of the information at year end. The Lender would then requireupdates each year to take into account additional loans actually made duringthe preceding year. While this would create a time lag in the procurementof flood insurance, it would seem to tie the requirement directly intothe use of the funds. It is the view of FIA that such flexibility of complianceoptions would be reasonable, considering that the statute may not havebeen enacted with the Home Equity Loan concept in mind. In any event, theFederal Instrumentalities have the final responsibility for determing howHome Equity Loans shall be handled under the 1973 Act.9.

The Requirements of the 1973 Act as to Condominiums<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Insurance/Property Repair Responsibility of Condominium Associations</ITAG>Condominium Associations, by both State law and association by-laws, typicallyhave the responsibility to purchase and maintain adequate insurance ontheir buildings and common areas of those buildings. In addition, theyalso have the responsibility to make repairs to all commonly owned property,regardless of whether or not there is adequate insurance to cover damageto the property.However, it must also be kept in mind that typically, it is the condominiumassociation unit owners who actually own property. In almost all situationsthe condominium association itself does not own the property, but is onlythe governing body for the condominium and contractually responsible forrepresenting and protecting the unit owners' undivided interests in thecommon areas. The ``condominium'' in the aggregate sense, therefore, wouldbe the collection of property rights comprising all individual units andcommon elements.From an insurance point of view the representative capacity of the condominiumassociation gives it the insurable interest in common areas, and even givesit the right to purchase coverage on individual units as a means of protectingthe entire condominium community. It is only in that sense that the associationmight be thought of as having a quasi ownership interest.In the past, Associations have traditionally fulfilled their insuranceresponsibility by purchasing some form of master ``Difference in Conditions''policy. Because of the unique nature of condominium ownership, these policieshave provided protection for the structural portion of the buildings, usuallyincluding most of the internal portions of the individual units as well.Individual policies were also available from the private insurance industry,but typically provided coverage for the unit owner and only for thingsunique to him, such as his contents and physical surface changes made byhim to the internal portion of his unit, such as new wall, floor or ceilingcoverings, all of which was of little interest to the lender as their mortgageeinterests were considered protected by the Association's master policy.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Lenders Interest</ITAG>The interests of individual lenders in the mortgages they have providedon individual units have typically been satisfied by obtaining evidenceof the existence of these master insurance policies, even though the Associations,unlike the unit owners, normally do not have mortgages. Such insuranceby Associations has proven a convenience to lenders since, in essence,full hazard insurance coverage is provided through one policy, alleviatingthe need to deal with a separate policy for each individual unit's mortgage.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Nature of Condominium Ownership/Lenders Exposure</ITAG>The concept of condominium ownership shapes not only the nature of theborrower's exposure to insurable risk, but also the kind of property interestthat the lender receives as security for the loan. While the owner of aunit in a condominium building, especially in the case of a townhouse,may appear to have the same kind of property interest as the owner of aseparately owned detached house, there is, in fact, a vast difference betweentheir interests. In its simplest terms, the owners of a condominium unitdoes not have exclusive ownership of the walls, floor and roof of his residenceor of the land upon which it rests. His exclusive property interest islimited to the space within the walls, floor and roof. Although he typicallyretains the exclusive right to occupy and sell this unit, all of his otherinterests in the common areas of the condominium are shared in common withthe owners of the other units owned by the members of the condominium association.There are various kinds of structures, involving condominium ownership.A condominium building may be a vertical, multiple story unit building(often called a ``high rise''), a townhouse or row house or, infrequently,a single unit building. The ownership interest of a purchaser of a unitusually includes (1) the airspace in the individual unit; (2) certain propertyattached to the building but within the unfinished perimeter walls, floorand ceiling of the unit; and (3) an undivided interest with all other unitowners in the common elements.The items attached to the building within the perimeter walls, floor andceiling, are often referred to as ``improvements and betterments'' or ``additionsand betterments'', which include floor, wall and ceiling coverings, cabinets,wallpaper, paneling, fixtures, built in appliances, partition walls, tubs,toilets, sinks, counter areas, etc. If a flood damages one or more unitsin a condominium building, and the individual unit owner of a damaged unitsustains damge to the improvements and betterments within this unit, heis not entitled to financial assistance from his fellow unit owners asto such property and must look to his own insurance protection.But unlike the owner of a detached individually owned non-condominium home,he is not primarily responsible for repairing the common elements in whichhe has an undivided interest, such as building walls, roofs, floors, stairways,lobbies, lawns, parking lots, sidewalks, and recreational facilities. Becauseof the multiplicity of these ownership interests, a condominium associationis typically the corporate entity responsible for the operation, maintenanceand repair of a condominium. Its membership is made up of the condominiumunit owners, all of whom collectively have an obligation to each otherto maintain and repair the commonly owned property. This specific obligationis customarily authorized and spelled out in the by-laws of an associationand is included in the condominium unit owner's contract agreement whichrequires each unit owner to pay a proportionate share of the amount ofmoney needed to perform maintenance and repair, as well as other administrativeand operating expenses, including the building up of reserves. They areusually collected monthly in order to provide a dependable source of operatingfunds for the association. The by-laws and unit owner's agreement willalso confer upon the Board of Directors of an association the authority,following loss or damage to the common elements, to levy special assessments,as necessary, to provide for the repair or reconstruction of loss or damageto the common elements. Thus, the funds for repair and/or reconstructioncan be obtained from the association's own funds and from the proceedsfrom claims filed against insurance policies and/or assessments leviedagainst the individual unit owners.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Peril of Flood</ITAG>Traditionally, the peril of flood was covered in the Difference in Conditionspolicies mentioned earlier. Associations that wished even more completeprotection against the peril of flood than these policies offered, i.e.,coverage for the deductible, would also purchase a policy under the NFIPfor each building in the floodplain. The motivation for such purchasesstems from the fact that Associations have the responsibility to purchaseinsurance in general to protect their property. Thus, it was not drivenby lender's insurance requirements placed on individual unit owners. However,those requirements were nonetheless able to be satisfied by that broadpolicy coverage purchased by the Association.As a result of this, few individual flood insurance policies were purchasedunder the NFIP covering the individual mortgages issued by lenders forunits involving condominium ownership in buildings located in flood hazardareas, as such coverage was evidently deemed by lenders to be unnecessaryand possibly duplicative.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Changes In The Market Place</ITAG>In the mid 1980's, conditions in the property insurance market changed,however, resulting in insurance companies either not continuing to offersuch broad based coverage at all or continuing to offer such coverage,only on a much more limited basis and virtually without any protectionfrom the peril of flood. At that time Associations, insurance agents, andlenders began to bring the issue to the attention of the Federal InsuranceAdministration. This brought focus on the flood insurance available fromthe FIA, as more and more the NFIP became virtually the only flood insuranceavailable for most types of residential property.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. NFIP Coverage_Satisfying Lender Requirements</ITAG>In one sense, in a manner similar to that followed in the private insurancesector, the NFIP has provided two different policies, one for individualunit owners, regardless of the type of configuration employed for theirunits, and another for the Associations. Unlike the private insurance sector,however, the insurance policies of the NFIP can only be issued as authorizedby the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, and, consequentlyNFIP policies are required to have various limitations and differencesthat distinguish them from insurance policies provided by the private insurancesector. Most significantly, NFIP insurance policies are limited as to theamount of coverage that they can provide for individual unit owners aswell as for the Association. Again, as differentiated from the insurancecoverage provided by the private sector, the NFIP's unit owner policy providescoverage for the unit owner's interest in the common areas of all buildings``owned'' by the Association, as well as for the internal portion of hisown unit.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Residential Coverage_Unit Owner</ITAG>Regardless of the type of building a residential condominium unit may belocated in, the NFIP considers the unit to be a single family dwelling(except for the limitation of its value to actual cash value rather thanreplacement value). The unit owner can purchase in his own name a floodinsurance policy on his unit within a building involving condominium ownership.In addition, if the unit owner has not already insured that same unit,the condominium association may separately insure a particular unit inthe name of the owner of record, specifying the unit number and the nameof the association, as their interests may appear. This would provide thesame kind of coverage as could be purchased individually by the unit owner.Such a policy will cover the improvements and betterments the unit ownerhas made within that unit. It will also respond to assessments levied uponthe residential unit owner by his condominium association for flood damageswhich occur in the building in which the unit owner resides as well asthe structural and or common elements of other buildings owned by the condominiumassociation for the repair of which he may be subject to assessment. However,because the NFIP policy does not cover lawns, parking lots, sidewalks andother improvements away from the building, the portion of any assessmentattributable to damage to such items would not be covered under an NFIPpolicy.Insurance policies covering an individual residential unit are availablein amounts up to the limits of coverage, and at the rates available, fora ``single family'' dwelling, regardless of the type of building in whichthe unit is located. But it must be noted that only those residential condominiumunits that are separate structures or are located in a townhouse or rowhouseconfiguration are eligible for replacement cost coverage.However, coverage is available to owners of units in other types of buildings,including high rise condominium buildings, on an actual cash value basis.Building coverage under a unit owners policy applies first to his or herindividually owned building improvements and betterments and, then, tothe damage to the building's overall common elements, which are the unitowner's responsibility and for which he or she is subject to assessment.The unit owner's policy described above will cover the owner's personalcontents, such as furniture, but only if separate contents coverage ispurchased by the unit owner.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Residential Coverage_Condominium Association</ITAG>However, inasmuch as the unit owners collectively have the responsibilityof repairing the common elements, the condominium association has beenthe traditional logical entity to be the purchaser of flood insurance.By insuring the overall condominium structure, the Association can reducethe likelihood that it will have to assess unit owners for funds with whichto make repairs. A condominium association may, in addition to purchasingpolicies on each individual unit, purchase insurance coverage on a residentialbuilding containing five or more units under a separate General PropertyForm. The policy will cover building common elements as well as the buildingelements (improvements and betterments) within all units in the building.The reason that condominium associations had to purchase the General PropertyForm and supplement it with separate policies on the individual units isthat the statute governing the NFIP limits the amount of coverage availableon multi-unit residential buildings to only $250,000, without regard tothe size, value or type of ownership involved. This has posed a problembecause such an amount is in most cases NOT sufficient to meet the collective,individual, and statutory flood insurance requirements with respect toall the mortgages for all the units located in a specific building.For this reason, FIA has encouraged lenders to treat the flood insurancerequirement on individual mortgages for individual units in buildings involvingcondominium ownership in the same way as they would for single family detachedproperties, and to require that flood coverage be purchased to protecttheir interests in those mortgages by having unit owners, or the Association,purchase individual unit owners Dwelling Policies. When this practice isfollowed, there should be every reason to believe that the mandatory floodinsurance purchase requirement for lenders has been satisfied.<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Condominium Master Policy (CMP) Under the NFIP   </ITAG>Beginning in early 1989, FIA made available to Condominium Associations,only, a Master Policy that provides flood insurance coverage on each residentialcondominium building separately, on one form, in much the same way thatthe private sector does for other hazards, without imposing the burdenof purchasing individual policies for each unit. Initially this policyis being made available only for such buildings with three or more floorsand five or more units. In addition to these benefits, the cost of sucha policy will in most cases be significantly less expensive than the costof multiple individual policies, while at the same time providing evenmore coverage, at the lower price. The rationale for making the Condominium Master Policy available at a lowercost is that by offering a more attractive and comprehensive policy, theNFIP will be in a position to issue more policies that will be in amountsreflecting the total value of the insured properties rather than issuingpolicies which cover only a fraction of the total value of the properties.In insurance terminology this is referred to as realizing ``more insuranceto value''. This should prove to be a great advantage to lenders, Associations,unit owners and insurance agents as it will provide more complete floodinsurance protection for less cost. In short, in a greatly simplified fashionit will assist the unit owners and their mortgage lenders in meeting themandatory flood insurance purchase requirements, Mortgage lenders shouldrealize, however, that it would be impractical to expect that every mortgageewith an interest in one or more units in such buildings will be able tobe listed as such on the CMP. Associations that purchase this policy inmost cases do not have a mortgage on the property, and therefore wouldhave no reason to list mortgagees on such policies. Other property insurancepolicies purchased by associations in the private sector to protect suchbuildings against other perils, typically, do not list mortgagees for theabove reason, as well as because of the practical aspects of the difficultythe insurers would have in keeping current with the names and addressesof all such mortgagees. Thus, the protection that exists for the interestsof the mortgagees on their mortgages in condominium buildings under MasterPolicies purchased in the private sector has always had to consist of thefiduciary responsibility that is placed on the association's Board of Directors,in the By-Laws of the associations for insuring the property and maintainingthe property in a proper state of repair.<ITAG tagnum="81">10. Non-Residential Coverage_Condominiums  </ITAG>Individual units in multi-unit <T3>non</T3> residential condominium buildings are treated differentlyby the NFIP. The commonly owned structural elements of such buildings,together with any community owned contents for that building, may <T3>not</T3> be insured by the individual unit owners. They may, however,be insured in the name of the association. Owners of nonresidential unitsmay purchase individual contents coverage in their own name for their owncontents.<ITAG tagnum="81">11. Coverage Options_For Lenders  </ITAG>(a) <T3>Individual Dwelling Policies.</T3> A lender can require the borrowerto purchase and maintain an individual Dwelling Policy for the appropriateamount, as discussed previously.(b) <T3>General Property Policy.</T3> A lender might accept evidence of a GeneralProperty Policy purchased by the association. However, as mentioned previously,the coverage limits available under this policy are only $250,000, andthat amount is the total for the entire building. It is therefore unlikelythat this will be sufficient insurance to cover all mortgages in the building.Even though such an amount might appear to be sufficient to cover an individualmortgage, its actual ability to provide protection with respect to thatmortgage will have to be significantly reduced at the time of loss, asany benefits arising out of that coverage will be shared with all of theother unit owners in that building, regardless of whether or not they havea mortgage.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> Lenders should be cautioned that they should not acceptevidence of this policy as automatically fulfilling their statutory requirement,without further reviewing the policy's details as to the amount of coveragebeing provided each unit in that building.</ITAG>(c) <T3>Condominium Master Policy.</T3> A lender could accept evidence of thispolicy being purchased by the association to meet the lenders regulatoryrequirement. The lender should be careful to assure that the amount ofcoverage purchased will be sufficient to meet its regulatory requirements.It will be easier for this to be the case because this policy is a compilationof individual Dwelling policies. Therefore, because the coverage limitsavailable under the Condominium Master Policy are $185,000 times the numberof units, the association may purchase up to that amount. The simplestway for a lender to be certain that the coverage on such a policy is sufficientis for the lender to divide the coverage purchased by the number of unitsin the building. If the resulting amount is at least $70,000, and the valueof the average unit is at least that amount, then the total coverage purchasedunder that policy is probably sufficient to meet the lender's basic requirements,on the basis of the statutory cap of $70,000.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ In this connection it should be noted that $70,000 isthe maximum amount of insurance required for single family residentialdwellings by section 1306(b)(6) of the 1968 Act (section 1413(b)(6) ofTitle 42 U.S.C.), which on October 12, 1977, modified the language of Section102 of the original 1973 Act, which defined the purchase requirement asbeing ``at least equal to the outstanding principal balance of the loanor the maximum limit of coverage made available with respect to this particulartype of property under the [1968] Act, whichever is less.''<ITAG tagnum="21">If sufficient amounts of Flood Insurance are purchased by the Associationunder option (c), this might be the best option for a lender to consider,as it will be the one most likely to fulfill the mandatory Flood InsurancePurchase Requirements. Since it is likely that it will be handled administrativelyby the association in the same manner as in the case of their other formsof property insurance, it should assure a higher likelihood that the Associationwill renew the policy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>National Flood Insurance Program_Application to Condominiums</T4><H1>Ownership</H1><H2>Property/Location </H2><H2>Unit owner </H2><H2>Association</H2><H1>Insurable Interest</H1><H2>Unit owner </H2><H2>Association</H2><H1>Flood Coverage Available </H1><H2>Unit owner </H2><H2>Association</H2>Within unit:<ITAG tagnum="3">Air space</ITAG><D>Y</D><D>N</D><D>N</D><D>N</D><D>N</D><D>N</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Wall, floor and ceiling coverings, improvements and betterments</ITAG><D>Y</D><D>N</D><D>Y</D><D>N</D><D>Y \5\</D><D>Y \6\</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Common structural elements</ITAG><D>N</D><D>Y</D><D>Y \5\</D><D>Y</D><D>Y \5\</D><D>Y \6\</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Contents</ITAG><D>Y</D><D>N \1\</D><D>Y</D><D>N \1\</D><D>Y</D><D>N \7\  </D>Outside unit:<ITAG tagnum="3">Common structural elements of all buildings owned by association</ITAG><D>Y \2\</D><D>Y \3\</D><D>Y</D><D>Y</D><D>Y \5\</D><D>Y</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Common areas (non-structural)</ITAG><D>Y \2\</D><D>Y \3\</D><D>N \4\</D><D>N \4\</D><D>N \4\</D><D>N \4\</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Common contents</ITAG><D>Y \2\</D><D>Y \3\</D><D>Y</D><D>Y</D><D>Y</D><D>Y</D><F>\1\ Except when contents of unit are commonly owned.</F><F>\2\ The unit owner owns a proportional share of the total common elements.</F><F>\3\ Ownership divided proportionally amongst all unit owners.</F><F>\4\ NFIP covers only buildings and their contents.</F><F>\5\ The Dwelling Policy covers both the unit owner's insurable interestin structural elements of the unit as well as those for all the commonstructural elements of the NFIP insured buildings.
