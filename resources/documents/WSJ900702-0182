This isn't a new effort; the 54-year-old conservative hasbeen pressing for changes in approach to constitutionalprovisions for most of his four years on the high court. Butthe list of constitutional principles that Justice Scaliawould alter keeps getting longer, and the youthful energy andintellectual zeal he brings to the task make his colleaguestake notice, even if they have given him little support thusfar.</LP><TEXT>   Last week, as the court term ended, Justice Scalia added anew constitutional arrow to his quiver. He said he will nolonger consider prisoners' claims that their death sentencesare unconstitutional because jurors had too little discretionto consider factors that might persuade them to recommendlife imprisonment rather than execution.   When the Supreme Court called a halt to capital punishmentin 1972, the justices ruled that imposition of the deathpenalty couldn't be left totally to the jury's discretion,that states must provide some standards and guidance forjurors. In 1976, the court upheld new death-penalty laws fromseveral states that limited jury discretion.   But according to Justice Scalia, in a concurring opinionlast week, a &quot;contradiction&quot; has developed in the court'sdeath-penalty decisions, which are based on interpretation ofthe Eighth Amendment prohibition of &quot;cruel and unusualpunishment.&quot; The court, he said, has continued to insist thatjury discretion to impose the death penalty must be limited,but has simultaneously recognized prisoners' arguments thatthe jury didn't have enough discretion to considerextenuating factors that might have tipped the jury in favorof imprisonment.   For death-row inmates, Justice Scalia's decision to rejectall claims based on failure to consider extenuating factorsisn't a big threat, as he has rarely voted in favor ofprisoners' claims.   Ironically, however, his stance puts him in a somewhatanalogous position to the court's leading liberals, JusticesWilliam Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, who from the oppositeend of the spectrum have refused to accept the court's 1976finding that state death-penalty laws were constitutional.The two dissent in every death-penalty case, arguing thatdeath sentences are &quot;cruel and unusual punishment.&quot;   Another line of constitutional attack by Justice Scaliabecame clearer this term. He said he won't accept the court'srulings striking down state laws that have the effect offavoring local businesses while discriminating againstcompanies based in other states.   The court bases rulings against such state laws on thepremise that the laws interfere with the free flow ofinterstate commerce and that the Constitution gives Congress,not the states, the power to regulate interstate commerce.   But Justice Scalia argues that the Constitution gives thepower over commerce only to Congress, and doesn't give thecourt the authority to strike down state business laws unlessthey directly clash with federal law.   Each time Justice Scalia unleashes a new constitutionalattack, it stirs up touchy and unsettled questions for hiscolleagues, as well as for court observers, about the properrole of precedent.   When it comes to constitutional precedent, most justicesagree that they have an individual obligation, secured bytheir oath of office, to interpret the Constitution as theysee it, and that it would be wrong to subscribe toconstitutional principles with which they disagree. But, asretired Justice Lewis Powell warned in a speech last year,too little respect for constitutional precedents &quot;wouldrepresent explicit endorsement of the idea that theConstitution is nothing more than what five justices say itis. This would undermine the rule of law.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
