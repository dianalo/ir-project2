(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Cheryl CurridandM;Microrim has given its venerable R:base a complete and much-needed face-lift,making version 3.0 stronger both as a database development tool and for adhoc user queries.andM;The upgrade hardly resembles earlier versions.andP;  Unlike Ashton-Tate's dBASEand Borland International Inc.'s Paradox, R:base ensures that data integrityestablished by the programmer is no longer easily circumvented by the user atthe command line.andM;The new version also adds pull-down menus, shadowed boxes, mouse support andfull use of color.andP;  A new menu system is much more logical, intuitive andaccessible.andM;Microrim has borrowed many of the ideas present in rival Paradox, includingusing the F2 key to execute operations and saving answers to queries as newtables.andM;The product also has many new features, for both users and applicationsdevelopers.andM;One is its ability to do most of the common database mechanics through menuselections.andM;Another is extensive, context-sensitive, on-line help, allowing users tolearn as they go.andM;Also new is R:base's forgiving nature.andP;  In version 3.0, both the structureand the database definitions can be changed easily.andP;  For example, if adatabase column set up as a text field ends up containing numeric data, itcan be changed to any of four numeric column types.andP;  Adding or deletingcolumns on a database table takes only a few steps.andM;Finally, 3.0 supports the complete set of Structured Query Language commands,including enhancements developed by IBM for DB2, its mainframe database.andM;For experienced R:base developers, a number of new commands make applicationsdevelopment easier.andP;  Forms that were assembled from a number of databases aregreatly simplified.andM;Certain characteristics, such as function-key use and submenus, are moreconsistent and predictable across the product.andP;  Microrim has simplified itsapplications generator, so a developer need only define menu options and pickactions to create the code.andM;With all the new improvements, there are a few shortcomings.andP;  One isforms-processing speed.andP;  When designing complex screen forms with largedatabases, saving one's changes could take as long as half a minute.andM;Another is attracting the legions of dBASE developers.andP;  R:base and dBASE arebased on different philosophies of database management, and the new versionwidens the gap between the two.andM;R:base 3.0 automatically manages all of the pieces of a database as anintegrated entity: multiple data tables, indexes, data dictionaries andintegrity rules.andP;  dBASE developers, however, are used to writing their ownprograms to manage these separate entities.andM;Finally, a new pick-list capability isn't very intuitive, although it isdocumented.andP;  To pick a value from another table, the value must first be readinto a variable and then saved into a value in the new table.andM;R:base 3.0, available now, costs $725; the version with a 286 DOS Extendercosts an additional $49.andM;----------Cheryl Currid manages the department responsible for applying informationtechnology at a major Fortune 500 company.andP;  Additional analysis was providedby Ted Mirecki.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
