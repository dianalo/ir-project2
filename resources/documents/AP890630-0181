President Bush said in a speech Thursday that he would ``workwith Congress on the development of details for increasing the payof those in Congress as well as other senior employees of theexecutive branch.''   A fact sheet released by the White House said Bush will send toCongress in the next few days a package that will include a 25percent pay increase for judges as well as an increase for a limitednumber of specialized professionals such as scientists and surgeons.   Strong criticism of that initial phase of the pay raise plan camefrom Carol A. Bonosaro, president of the Senior ExecutivesAssociation.   She said the group was ``adamantly opposed to any pay proposalthat calls for pay increases only for selective positions within theSenior Executive Service scientific and technical community and forthe federal judiciary.''   ``While we understand the extraordinary difficulty of retainingand recruiting senior scientists and surgeons, we will vigorouslyoppose any pay increase proposal that does not call for anacross-the-board increase for all Senior Executive Servicepositions,'' Ms. Bonosaro said.   Alixe Glen, a White House spokeswoman, said it was premature foranyone to criticize the president because Bush has made no formalannouncement of a specific pay raise proposal.   ``The president hasn't decided what exactly he would like to seehappen regarding an executive branch pay raise,'' Ms. Glen said.   White House officials have said Bush wants to put out hisspecific proposal before he leaves for Europe July 9.</TEXT></DOC>
