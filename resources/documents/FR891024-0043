PGT intends to provide firm and interruptible transportation serviceson these new, incremental facilities, all as more fully set forth in therequest on file with the commission and open to public inspection. PGT's original application in Docket No. CP89-460-000 seeks authorizationto construct and operate facilities and authorization for the interstatetransportation of natural gas transported thereby for certain shippersin the Pacific Northwest the intermountain region and California (jointlyreferred to as shippers). Specifically, PGT seeks authorization to constructand operate an incremental looping of its existing pipeline facilitiesfrom Kingsgate, British Columbia to Malin, Oregon at the interconnectionwith the facilities of PGT's parent Pacific Gas and Electric (PGandamp;E).The original facilities design in Docket No. CP89-460-000 provided forfirm annual average transportation service of approximately 150 MMcf perday to the Pacific Northwest and 600 MMcf per day to California. Since the filing of the original application in Docket No. CP89-460-000,PGT states that it has fully subscribed the capacity on the proposed facilitiesthrough the execution of exclusive Precedent Agreements. Moreover, PGTstates, discussions with these Shippers led to a commitment by PGT to modifythe design of the looping facilities to reflect the specific annual seasonalrequirements of these shippers and to add additional delivery points. PGT states that the purpsoe of its amendment is to reflect these additionalshippers, their volumetric requirements and the resulting facility andrelated cost changes.

PGT will transport the gas for the Shippersthrough the Expansion Project, to various off-line delivery points in Idaho,Washington,, and Oregon for redelivery to the Pacific Northwest and intermountainregion Shippers, and to a delivery point on PGandamp;E's pipeline systemat Malin, Oregon where PGandamp;E will provide the firm transportation onto Kern River Station for redelivery to California Shippers. PGT will alsoreceive certain volumes at Stanfield, Oregon for delivery to Kern RiverStation.Expanding its facilities as necessary, PGandamp;E will deliver thermallyequivalent volumes, adjusted for fuel and line losses, to southern Californiaat the major intrastate interconnection of the PGandamp;E and Southern CaliforniaGas Company (SoCal Gas) systems at the Kern River Station. Gas serviceto northern and central California will also be provided from this pointby PGandamp;E. In the Pacific Northwest and the intermountain region, Shipperswill be responsible for redelivery of the gas to their own distributionsystems from the point of interconnection with Northwest's existing systemat Stanfield, Spokane, or other established delivery points.PGT estimates that on or about November 1, 1993, it will begin deliveriesfor the Customers, assuming the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvalsand the completion of necessary preconstruction activities in time to allowconstruction to begin in early 1992.Proposed Facilities, Capital Costs, and Tariffs PGT's proposed facilities now consist of 430 miles of 42-inch pipelinelooping which will operate at the same maximum pressure as PGT's existingpipeline, 911 psig. Capital costs, including allowance for funds used during construction,for PGT's portion of the Expansion Project are estimated, on a fourth quarter1988 cost basis, at $653,050,000, an increase over the originally filedcosts of $164,934,000. PGT proposed to finance the Expansion Project, withan initial projected mix of 70 percent debt and 30 percent equity capital.PGT proposes to depreciate the Expansion Project based on a 30-year life.The cost for the proposed new transportation services continue to includeonly incremental costs and do not include any costs of PGT's existing pipelinesystem. Under this cost allocation proposal, PGT's existing customers bearno cost responsibility for service on the Expansion Project. PGT now proposes to provide new firm transportation service, based on theincremental cost of the Expansion Project, via only Rate Schedule T-3,which now incorporates all firm transportation service. Previously-filedSchedule T-4 is now deleted. The proposed rate structure has been modified from a two-part monthly reservationcharge to a one-part reservation charge initially designed to recover 100percent of the total fixed costs of the Expansion Project based upon contractedmaximum daily quantities. This change reflects the Commission's rate designpolicy at Docket No. PL-89-2, et al. PGT continues to request the authorityto negotiate individually with Customers, a reservation charge which maybe lower than the maximum level contained in this Application. Firm transportationpriorities would be based on the value of the Customer's per-unit reservationcharge. Some specific changes from PGT's original proposal in Docket No. CP89-460-000in its amendment are: (1) PGT proposes to install approximately 430 miles of 42-inch diameterpipeline looping instead of the 36-inch diameter pipeline looping previouslyproposed. (2) PGT states that discussions with its shippers led to a commitment byPGT to modify the design of the looping facilities to reflect the specificannual seasonal requirements of the shippers. (3) The original facilities design provided for firm annual average transportationservice of approximately 150 MMcf per day to the Pacific Northwest and600 MMcf per day to California; whereas, the amended proposal calls foran increase in deliveries to California of approximately 766 MMcf per daynear Malin, Oregon. (4) Capital costs for the amended proposal are now estimated at $635,050,000on a 1988 cost basis rather than the $470,116,000 previously proposed.(5) The original proposed rate structure consisted of a two-part monthlyreservation charge using a D-1 and D-2 component, each designed to uncover50 percent of the total fixed cost of the expansion; whereas, the amendedproposal consists of a one-part reservation charge initially designed torecover 100 percent of the total fixed cost of the expansion project. <T3>Comment date: </T3> November 7, 1989, in accordance with the firstsubparagraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Standard Paragraphs </ITAG>F.
