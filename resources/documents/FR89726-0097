Background </ITAG>Pursuant to Public Law (P.L.) 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(the Commission) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. P.L. 97-415revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act),to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, orproposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act.This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediatelyeffective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination bythe Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration,notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearingfrom any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposedto be issued from June 30, 1989 through July 14, 1989. The last biweeklynotice was published on July 12, 1989 (54 FR 29397). <ITAG tagnum="84">NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATINGLICENSE AND PROPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION DETERMINATIONAND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING </ITAG>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendmentrequests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for eachamendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration and Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page numberof this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-216, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Marylandfrom 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC The filing of requests for hearing and petitions forleave to intervene is discussed below. By August 25, 1989, the licensee may file a request for a hearing withrespect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operatinglicense and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceedingand who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file awritten petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitionsfor leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filedby the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board,designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety andLicensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and theSecretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issuea notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Anyhearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received before action is taken. Should theCommission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance and providefor opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects thatthe need to take this action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitionsare filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">Arkansas Power andamp; Light Company, Docket No. 50-313, Arkansas NuclearOne, Unit 1, Pope County, Arkansas </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>December 16, 1988 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>This amendment would modifythe Technical Specifications (TS) related to fire barriers.

For each of the abovechanges, appropriate changes to the TS Bases have been made. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards in 10 CFR 50.92(c) for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists. A proposed amendmentto an Operating License for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated,or (3) involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. ArkansasPower and Light Company (APandamp;L) has reviewed the proposed change andhas determined that: <ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change to the title of Sections 3.21, 4.24 and the Bases,and the use of the term ``OPERABLE'' instead of functional or intact donot involve a significant hazards consideration because operation of ArkansasNuclear One, Unit 1 in accordance with this change would not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously analyzed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change would not increase the probability or consequencesof any accident previously evaluated since this administrative change doesnot provide any relief from the requirements of the Technical Specifications,or change the intended operation or administrative requirements of theplant or its design bases. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any previously analyzed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change would not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any previously analyzed since this administrativechange does not adversely affect any components or systems which contributeto the safety of the plant. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change would not involve a significant reduction in themargin of safety since this change has no effect on any plant safety parameters,accident mitigation capabilities, or procedures. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes to Sections 3.21 and 3.21.1 and their correspondingBases do not involve a significant hazards consideration because operationof Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 1 in accordance with this change would not:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously analyzed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change would increase the scope of this Technical Specificationto specifically include fire barriers separating both safety related fireareas as well as redundant safe shutdown systems required in the eventof a fire.

Thistest would require meeting all of the performance criteria of the surveillancetest specified by TS 4.8.1(a)1., except the minimum discharge pressureand flow, which can be achieved only with normal operating secondary systemsteam pressure. This test requirement is more restrictive than past licenseeinterpretations of this TS, which held that a functional test could beperformed only at full steam pressure in order to meet the discharge pressureand flow criteria. Therefore, this change represents an additional requirementwhich enhances the safe operation of the plant by providing further assuranceof the availability of the turbine driven EFW pump prior to heatup. The Commission has provided guidance for the application of criteria forno significant hazards consideration determination by providing examplesof amendments that are considered not likely to involve significant hazardsconsiderations (51 FR 7751). These examples include: Example (ii), a changethat constitutes an additional limitation, restriction, or control notpresently included in the Technical Specifications: e.g, ``a more stringentsurveillance requirement.'' The new requirement to perform a functional test of the turbine drivenEFW pump prior to heating the reactor coolant system above 280anddegrees;F constitutes an additional limitation, restriction, and control not presentlyincluded in the Technical Specifications. Therefore, the proposed amendmentis within the scope of the example. Since the application for amendment involves a proposed change that isencompassed by an example for which no significant hazards considerationexists, the staff has made a proposed determination that the applicationinvolves no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Tomlinson Library, ArkansasTech University, Russellville, Arkansas 72801 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Nicholas S.

Arkansas Power and Light (APandamp;L) is presently in the process of replacingpart of the hardware in the ANO-2 Core Protection Calculator System. Thiseffort is scheduled for completion during the upcoming 2R7 refueling outage,presently scheduled to begin in September of this year. A portion of thehardware upgrade includes new fiber optics devices to provide interchannelisolation for the CPC/Core Element Assembly Calculator (CEAC) data linksand the CEA position isolation amplifiers. The use of fiber optics equipmentfor data transmission offers superior isolation capabilities compared tothe existing system, which uses conductive wiring and optical isolatorsto achieve the required channel isolation. Technical Specification 4.3.1.1.4contains the surveillance requirements for the specific isolation equipmentin the existing CPCS hardware. Testing of the new devices in accordancewith the existing TS is neither necessary nor practical, as the new equipmentuses non-conducting fiber optics cable. The existing TS will no longerbe appropriate upon completion of the CPCS upgrade and is therefore proposedto be removed. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards in 10 CFR 50.92(c) for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists. A proposed amendmentto an Operating License for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated,or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed change simply deletes a surveillancerequirement which is no longer applicable for the equipment installed inthe plant. This will not impact the accident-initiating events describedin Chapter 15 of the ANO-2 SAR. Further, the proposed change will not adverselyaffect the consequences of accidents which have been previously evaluated.The proposed change simply reflects the upgrading of hardware in a plantprotection system, which should increase the system reliability and thereforeincrease the ability to mitigate the consequences of postulated accidents.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The equipment upgrade associated with the proposed change will notchange the overall design and protection system function of the CPCS, andthe new hardware serves the same purpose as the hardware it replaces; therefore,the proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident.

A proposed amendmentto an Operating License for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated,or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. ArkansasPower and Light Company (APandamp;L) has reviewed the proposed change andhas determined that: <ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.The proposed changes to the CEA drop time requirements have been evaluatedfor impact on the ANO-2 accident analyses. The change involves only anacceptance criteria for equipment performance and no physical changes.The CEA drop time acceptance criteria are used to develop trip reactivityinsertion rates which are in turn used as inputs to the accident analyses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Combustion Engineering analyses have demonstrated that the calculatedtrip reactivity for a distributed CEA drop pattern is the same as the tripreactivity calculated for the unrealistic non-distributed pattern currentlyassumed. Since the trip reactivity assumed in the accident analyses isnot adversely impacted by consideration of a distributed CEA drop pattern,the proposed limits will not increase the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The proposed amendment does not created the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. The proposedchange does not involve any new or modified structures, systems or components;rather, it affects only an acceptance criteria for confirming the requiredperformance of the existing CEA hardware. Therefore, the proposed changewould not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The margins of safety related to CEA insertion aredefined by the analyzed events in the Safety Analysis Report which creditthe insertion. As demonstrated in Criterion 1 above, the proposed limitson CEA drop time have no adverse impact on the accident analyses. Therefore,the margins of safety reflected in the accident analysis conclusions arenot reduced. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application ofstandards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists.This guidance includes examples (51 FR 7750) of types of amendments thatare considered not likely to involve significant hazards considerations.The change proposed in this amendment is not directly comparable to anyof the examples identified in 51 FR 7750. </ITAG>Based on the previous discussion, the licensee concluded that the proposedamendment request does not involve a significant increase in the probabilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;nor involve a significant reduction in the required margin of safety.

In addition, NUREG 0473, Revision3 Draft 7 has identified the child inhalation pathway as a more limitingreceptor pathway and, therefore, the use of a more limiting receptor fordose calculation does not increase the consequences of an accident previouslyevaluated. 2. The proposed amendment changes the pathway for calculating the restricteddose rate, and allows for a change in the computer model for dose calculation.The change to the dose calculation model does not involve a change in safetylimits, limiting safety system settings, or limiting conditions for operation.Therefore, it does not create any new or different kind of accident thanpreviously evaluated. 3.

It will allow Zion Station's steam generator tubes to berepaired, if needed, by utilizing the Bechtel-KWU Alliance sleeving methodology.The existing Technical Specifications have been previously separately amendedto permit utilization of the Combustion Engineering (CE) and the Westinghouse(WE) processes for steam generator tube sleeving. The addition of the Bechtel-KWUAlliance methodology as an approved alternative repair method would provideZion with the flexibility necessary to continue with the philosophy ofusing an integrated refueling outage coordination. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The staff has evaluated this proposed amendment and determined thatit involves no significant hazards consideration. According to 10 CFR 50.92(c),a proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequence of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The Commonwealth Edison Company (the licensee) provided the following discussionregarding each of the above criteria for no significant hazards considerationdetermination. <T3>DISCUSSION - ITEM 1</T3> The creation of the option to utilize the Bechtel-KWU Alliance welded sleeveprocess to repair a defective steam generator tube has no effect on eitherthe probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. Asdiscussed in Bechtel-KWU Alliance report, BKAT-01-P, Revision 1, the integrityof the steam generator tubes will be equivalent to that of an originaltube, or a tube sleeved by the NRC-approved CE or WE processes. The continuedintegrity of the sleeves will be verified by the inspection program requiredas a result of this change. Thus, since the structural integrity of the tubes will not be adverselyaffected by this change, there is no increase in the probability of anaccident previously evaluated. Specifically, the probability of a steamgenerator tube rupture will be unaltered. In addition, the steam generator will remain capable of performing itsrequired heat transfer function. The information provided in Section 4.3.5of BKAT-01-P, Revision 1 demonstrates that the sleeve-induced primary flowreduction resulting from the use of a Bechtel-KWU Alliance sleeve is comparableto the currently approved WE or CE processes. As a result, the choice toinstall a Bechtel-KWU Alliance sleeve, as opposed to a WE or CE sleeve,will have no significant effect on the steam generator's heat transferability. The sleeving process will allow a repaired steam generator tube to remainin service, rather than completely blocking the tube's flow with plugs.Thus, the act of placing a sleeve in a steam generator tube actually resultsin a more efficient steam generator relative to plugging the tube. Based upon the above discussion, the consequences of any accident previouslyevaluated will be unaffected because the heat transfer capability of thesteam generators will not be significantly altered. <T3>DISCUSSION - ITEM 2</T3> As discussed above, both the structural integrity and the heat transfercapability of Zion steam generators will not be significantly affectedby the use of the Bechtel-KWU Alliance welded sleeve process instead ofthe WE or CE sleeve processes. In addition, the steam generator tube sleevesdo not interact with any other of Zion's systems. The ability of Zion'ssafety systems to perform their function will not be altered. Thus, thereis no potential for a new or different kind of accident due to the useof the Bechtel-KWU sleeving process to repair Zion's steam generators.<T3>DISCUSSION - ITEM 3</T3> The heat transfer capabilities of Zion's steam generators will not be significantlyaltered through the utilization of Bechtel-KWU Alliance welded sleevesas opposed to the currently approved WE or CE sleeves. In general, thesleeving process, whether the Bechtel-KWU Alliance, WE, or CE processesare utilized, results in a more efficient steam generator when comparedto the plugging alternative. As discussed above and in BKAT-01-P, Revision 1, the structural integrityof the steam generator tubes will be unaltered. Use of the Bechtel-KWUAlliance, WE, or CE sleeving processes will produce a primary system boundarywith the appropriate integrity. Since both the structural integrity and the heat transfer capability ofZion's steam generators will not be significantly altered by the choiceof sleeving processes, the margin of safety will not be affected. Therefore, since the application for amendment satisfies the criteria specifiedin 10 CFR 50.92, Commonwealth Edison Company made a determination thatthe application involves no significant hazards consideration. After preliminary review of licensee's submittal, the staff agrees withlicensee's overall conclusion. Accordingly, the Commission proposes todetermine that the proposed changes to the Technical Specifications involveno significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Waukegan Public Library,128 N.

Furthermore,the licensee determined that despite the proposed changes to the technicalspecifications, the design requirement of the containment depressurizationsystems will continue to be met, and safety-related equipment which requireriver water cooling will be capable of performing their design functionsat the increased service water temperature limit. Hence the answer to thefirst criterion is negative. There is no hardware, software or operational procedure changes as a resultof the proposed amendment.

This change will allow the use of Commission-approved methodologiesfor containment leakage testing that have been incorporated into the regulationsfor general industry use (53 FR 45890). With respect to the second criterion, the licensee determined that theproposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated since the amendmentinvolves no physical change to the plant, nor any change in plant operatingprocedures. With respect to the third criterion, the licensee determined that the proposedamendment would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safetysince the margin of safety currently provided by the TS remains the same.The proposed amendment still requires containment leakage testing to beperformed at the same frequency, per 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, and inaccordance with Commission-approved methodologies. The staff has performed a preliminary evaluation of the licensee's submittaland believes that the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92 are met. Therefore, thestaff proposes to determine that the proposed amendment involves no significanthazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Crystal River Public Library,668 N.W.

TS 3.3.3.6, ``AccidentMonitoring Instrumentation,'' allows 7 days to restore an inoperable monitorto operable status before proceeding to a lower mode of operation. If twomonitors are inoperable, 48 hours are allowed to restore at least one tooperable status. TS 3.6.4.1, ``Hydrogen Monitors,'' allows 30 days and72 hours, respectively. The 30 day requirement is consistent with GenericLetter 83-37 and is appropriate given the function performed by the hydrogenmonitors. The licensee is therefore proposing to revise TS 3.3.3.6 to referto TS 3.6.4.1 for action requirements when a hydrogen monitor is inoperable.The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.In regard to the proposed amendments, the licensee has determined the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed change will not significantly increase the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The change affectsonly the time limit for restoring an inoperable containment hydrogen concentrationmonitor to operable status. These monitors are provided for post-LOCA indicationand recording. They perform no control or trip functions and are not neededfor immediate post-accident mitigative action. Hydrogen buildup followinga LOCA is a slow process and alternate means of hydrogen monitoring areavailable. Even in the total absence of hydrogen monitoring, the hydrogenrecombiners could sill be operated. The change will, therefore, have nosignificant negative effect on post-accident hydrogen control and the consequencesof a LOCA would remain within previously analyzed limits. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2.

The proposed change does not involve a significant increase inthe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Thechange does not affect equipment involved in the initiation of previouslyevaluated accidents. The probability of such accidents is therefore notincreased. The change concerns the Control Room Emergency Filtration System(CREFS) and its associated actuation instrumentation, which function tomitigate the consequences of accidents. The change does not alter CREFSdesign or operation. The change revises the applicable action statementsto permit mode changes if the action statement allows continued unit operationfor an unlimited period of time. The action statements were written suchthat continued operation for an unlimited time is not permitted unlessthe Technical Specification bases for the CREFS and its actuation instrumentationcontinue to be met. That is, the CREFS will ensure that equipment qualificationtemperatures are not exceeded and that the control room would remain habitableduring and following all credible accident conditions (including considerationof a single failure) and the instrumentation will ensure a redundant anddiverse means to initiate a Control Room Isolation in response to credibleaccidents in either unit (including consideration of a single failure).The CREFS would therefore respond as previously analyzed if a demand occurredwhile operating in one of the affected action statements.

For convenience and ALARA considerations, it is desirableto provide 480 volt recepticles in the drywell to power tools and othertemporary equipment during future outages rather than run temporary powercables into the drywell. The design to provide power for the two receptaclesrequires the use of a containment electrical penetration. These circuitsmust be added to TS Table 3.8.4.1-1 for primary containment conductor overcurrentprotection devices utilizing Gould Type HE43 circuit breakers. The wiringwas implemented during the recent refueling outage; however, the licenseehas stated that the circuits are deenergized and will continue to be verifiedas deenergized during Operational Conditions 1, 2, or 3 until the proposedchange is approved. The new receptacles perform no safety-related function,and no safety-related systems, other than the containment penetrations,are affected by this modification. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee provided an analysis that addressed the above three standardsin the amendment application. <ITAG tagnum="21">1. No significant increase in the probability or consequences of anaccident previously evaluated results from the proposed change because:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The conduit, cable and equipment associated with this modificationare being installed in accordance with all applicable seismic and electricalseparation criteria. As such, adequate electrical protection in conformancewith the Technical Specification Bases and USAR Section 8.3.1.1.4.3 isprovided for all containment penetrations used. Operation or failure ofthe equipment installed by this modification has no impact on any safety-relatedsystem. Because this proposed change does not result in any new plant operatingmodes and electrical penetration overcurrent protection is provided asdescribed in the USAR, this proposed change cannot increase the probabilityor consequences of any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. This proposed change will not create the possibility of a new ordifferent kind of accident than any previously evaluated because: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A single failure of the equipment installed by this modification wouldat worst cause a loss of power to motor control center (MCC) 1NHS-MCC2A.Loss of this nonsafety-related MCC is assumed by the USAR during designbasis accident conditions and is therefore, as previously analyzed. Noother new, credible failure modes can be identified. The circuit protectiondesign is identical to the as-built configuration for receptacle 1POP-WR2A01already listed on Technical Specification Table 3.8.4.1-1. Additionally,this proposed change does not introduce any new plant operating modes.Therefore, this proposed change cannot create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction inthe margin of safety because: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Overcurrent protection is provided such that no single failure willcause excessive current in the penetration conductors.

This request was previously noticed in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on May 31, 1989 at 54 FR 23319. This replacesthe previous notice. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a nosignificant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c).A proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee, in its submittal of May 12, 1989, evaluated the proposedchanges against the significant hazards criteria of 10 CFR 50.92 and againstthe Commission guidance concerning application of this standard. Basedon the evaluation given below, the licensee has concluded that the proposedchanges do not involve a significant hazards consideration. The licensee'sevaluation is as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">a. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Diablo Canyon offsite and onsite power systems are highly reliable.The 230kV and 500kV systems have been demonstrated to provide reliableoffsite power sources for both units. The DCPP DG reliability history indicatesthat average reliability is higher than the requirements in RegulatoryGuide 1.155, Station Blackout, and is higher than the industry average.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The risk and reliability evaluation determined that the probabilityof an accident previously evaluated does not significantly change by increasingthe DG AOT from 72 hours to 7 days. The relative risk evaluation demonstratedthat the relative risk remained low with an increased AOT from 72 hoursto 7 days because of the improved maintenance possible with the 7-day AOTand the avoidance of multiple 72-hour AOTs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Increasing the DG AOT does not involve physical alteration of anyplant equipment and does not affect analysis assumptions regarding functioningof required equipment designed to mitigate the consequences of accidents.Further, the severity of postulated accidents and resulting radiologicaleffluent releases will not be affected by the increased AOT. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kindof accident from any accident previously evaluated? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Extending the DG AOT from 72 hours to 7 days does not necessitatephysical alteration of the plant or changes in parameters governing normalplant operation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Thus, this change does not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated for Diablo Canyon.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin ofsafety? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As discussed above, the risk and reliability evaluations determinedthat the change in core melt frequency for a 7-day AOT compared with a72-hour AOT is insignificant. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, this change does not result in a significant reductionin a margin of safety. </ITAG>The NRC Staff has reviewed the proposed changes, including the additionalrestrictions proposed in the licensee's letter of July 3, 1989, and thelicensee's no significant hazards consideration determination and findsthem acceptable.

The staff has reviewed the licensee's request and concurs with the followingbasis and conclusion provided by the licensee in its June 16, 1989 submittal.<ITAG tagnum="21">I. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase inthe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As stated previously (See licensee's June 16, 1989 application), adecision was made to cancel the RHR waterhammer backpressure control valvemodification based upon reduced SRV leakage and improved suppression pooltemperature measuring methods. The improvements noted reduce the frequencyand duration of cycles that the RHR system operates in suppression poolcooling to within the design basis as stated in the FSAR. Therefore, thedeletion of the proposed valves (HV-25129 Aandamp;B) from Table 3.6.3-1 doesnot affect the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Since the waterhammer modification is being cancelled, the deletionof the revised Section B 3/4.6.2 is an administrative change. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The moving of valves (HV-251F011 Aandamp;B) from Section B (Manual IsolationValves) of Table 3.6.3-1 to Section C (Other Valves) does not impact thecontainment isolation function of these valves.

The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new ordifferent kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Sinceimprovements have been made to the plant, and the RHR system operates withinthe design bases as stated in the FSAR, the deletion of the proposed valvesdoes not create any new concerns. The removal of the revised Bases sectionand the rearrangement of valves on Table 3.6.3-1 are administrative changesand do not create new concerns. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Since the power from valves HV-E11-2F011 Aandamp;B and HV-E11-2F026Aandamp;B is removed and leakage requirements for containment integrity andisolation do not change, no new concerns are created by this proposal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">III. The proposed change does not involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Since the RHR system functions within the design basis, the overallsafety margin is not reduced by not installing the proposed valves. Thedeletion of the Bases section and the revision to Table 3.6.3-1 are administrativechanges and do not reduce the margin of safety. Since the containment isolationand integrity are assured to the same relevant criteria as discussed previously,the overall safety margin has not been reduced due to the proposed changesto Table 3.8.4.2.1-1. </ITAG>Based on the above considerations, the Commission proposes to determinethat the proposed changes involve no significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Osterhout Free Library, ReferenceDepartment, 71 South Franklin Street, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania 18701<T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Jay Silberg, Esquire, Shaw, Pittman, Pottsand Trowbridge, 2300 N Street NW., Washington, DC 20037 <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>Walter R.

The proposed change does not involve a significant increase inthe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As stated previously, the results provided in the analysis supportingU1C5 are correct. Therefore, the analytical methodology used to developdelta CPRs, which was previously approved by the NRC, is not in question.The proposed change corrects an error in converting the analytical resultsto the MCPR operating limit curve when EOC-RPT is inoperable. Correctionof this error results in a more restrictive limit at end-of-cycle; thiswill not result in an increase in the probability or consequences of anaccident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The increased application of Figure 3.2.3-1 from 40% to 30% totalcore flow is the result of a more accurate definition of the SSES Unit1 two pump minimum speed operating line. The change to include 30% totalcore flow was performed to ensure an operating limit was provided whichbounds the redefined line.

Specification 3.2.1 is revised to remove anunnecessary reference to ANF fuel, and to remove a cross-reference footnoteto SLO since this limit will no longer change for SLO. Specification 3.2.4also deletes unnecessary references to ANF fuel. Finally, Specification3.4.1.1.2 deletes the reference to MAPLHGR, because it no longer representsa ``revised specification limit'' during SLO.

The correction proposed will ensure proper limits basedon the methodology; it cannot create a new event. The increased flow rangefor Figure 3.2.3-1 is the result of more accurate information as to thelocation of the two pump minimum speed line. Addition of this new lowerlimit ensures proper restrictions for this flow range; it cannot createa new event. The editorial changes, by nature, cannot create new events.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">III. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The twochanges to the MCPR figures provide corrections based on more accurateinformation. The change to the MCPR curves with EOC-RPT inoperable resultsin a more restrictive minimum limit. The increased flow range in Figure3.2.3-1 results in a limit that was previously not provided. The rest ofthe changes are editorial in nature.

Miscellaneous administrative changes are also proposed.<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licenseehas provided a discussion of the proposed changes as they relate to thesestandards; the discussion is presented below. <ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 1: The proposed revisions do not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluatedbecause the revised thermal and pressurization limits prohibit conditionswhere brittle fracture of reactor vessel materials is possible. Consequently,there will be no increase in the probability or consequences of previouslyevaluated accidents since the primary coolant pressure boundary integritywill be maintained as assumed in the safety design analyses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The RT<T2>NDT</T2> used to evaluate the new pressure/temperature limits for thebeltline material was based on the guidance in Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision2, which is the latest guidance on RT<T2>NDT</T2> determinations. The revised pressure/temperature limits curveswere conservatively generated in accordance with the fracture toughnessrequirements of 10 CFR 50, Appendix G, as supplemented by Appendix G toSection III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The proposed minimumallowable temperature at which head bolting studs may be under tensionis also in accordance with 10 CFR 50, Appendix G, as supplemented by AppendixG to Section III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Removal of Figure 3.6.4 is of no safety significance because it wasfor information only and is no longer appropriate. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 2: The proposed revisions do not create the possibility ofa new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluatedbecause the revised thermal and pressurization limits do not create anynew kind of operating mode or introduce any new potential failure mode.Conditions where brittle fracture of primary coolant pressure boundarymaterials is possible will be avoided. The proposed changes reduce theconservative margin that was incorporated into the development of the currentlimits. The current limits have been shown by review of material characteristicsand by more recent and more accurate tests and analyses to be overly restrictive.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 3: The proposed revisions do not involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety because the proposed pressure/temperature limitsstill provide sufficient safety margin. The revised pressure/temperaturelimits, although less restrictive than the current limits, were establishedin accordance with current regulations and the latest regulatory guidanceon RT<T2>NDT</T2> determinations. Thus, the proposed changes merely reduce overconservativelimits to acceptable limits. Because operation will be within these limits,the reactor vessel materials will behave in a non-brittle manner, thus,preserving the original safety design bases. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis. Accordingly, the Commission has proposed to determine that the above changesdo not involve a significant hazards consideration. The licensee also proposes certain administrative changes to the technicalSpecification pages involved with the changes discussed above. These administrativechanges include rewording TS 3.6.A.3 to more accurately describe the vesselmaterials and appertainances involved, revision of the ``neutron flux specimen''terminology on TS 4.6.A.2 to ``surveillance specimen'', revisions to TSpage 144 to reflect removal of a surveillance capsule, deletion of referralto a figure that is proposed to be removed, addition of Figure 3.6.5 tothe list on TS page iv(a), revision of the Bases and other changes of aformatting and typographical nature. The Commission has provided guidancefor the application of the criteria for no significant hazards considerationdetermination by providing examples of amendments that are considered notlikely to involve significant hazards considerations (51 FR 7751). Theseexamples include: Example (i) ``A purely administrative change to technicalspecification: for example, a change to achieve consistency throughoutthe technical specifications, corrections of an error, or a change in nomenclature.''These proposed changes are examples of such administrative changes andsince these proposed changes are encompassed by an example for which nosignificant hazard exists, the staff has made a proposed determinationthat it involves no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room Location: </T3>Government Publications Section,State Library of Pennsylvania, Education Building, Commonwealth and WalnutStreets, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17126. <T3>Attorney for Licensee: </T3>Troy B. Conner, Jr. 1747 Pennsylvania Avenue,NW., Washington, DC 20006. <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>Walter R. Butler <ITAG tagnum="84">Power Authority of the State of New York, Docket No. 50-333, JamesA. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, Oswego, New York </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>May 31, 1989 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldmodify the Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) System surveillance testrequirements to reflect the Recirculation System loop selection logic modificationinstalled during the Reload 1/Cycle 2 refueling outage. Other changes tovarious surveillance test requirements throughout the Technical Specifications(TS) would, where appropriate, replace the term ``demonstrate'' with theterm ``verify'' so that each term is used consistently according to statedguidelines. The effect would be to reduce the need for redundant and unnecessarytests when related equipment is made or found to be inoperable. The proposed change to reflect the loop selection modification would affectSpecification 4.5.A.3 by replacing the LPCI test criteria which statesthat ``three Residual Heat Removal (RHR) pumps shall deliver at least 23,100gpm against a system head corresponding to a reactor vessel pressure of20 psig'' with the criteria which states that ``each RHR pump shall deliverat least 9,900 gpm against a system head corresponding to a reactor vesselto primary containment differential pressure of greater than or equal to20 psid.'' Other related changes would affect Specifications 3.5.A.3, 4.5.A.2,4.5.A.3.a, 4.5.A.3.b, 3.5.A.3.b, 4.5.B.1 and 3.5.A Bases to reflect thechange from the ``LPCI mode'' concept to the division of the LPCI systeminto two subsystems which then incorporate actions which would be necessaryif one of these subsystems is made or found to be inoperable. Thus, thecriteria is similar to the Core Spray System/Subsystem criteria, LimitingConditions for Operation, and Surveillance Test Requirements. No systemchanges are required. The other proposed change, the appropriateness of replacing the word ``demonstrate''with the word ``verify,'' was evaluated throughout the TS. Where a specificationrequires testing at a specific frequency or the intent is clearly to requireperformance of an actual test to determine component or system operability,no TS change was proposed and the word ``demonstrate'' is retained. However,if the TS criteria is such that operability could be determined by ensuringthat the associated surveillance tests have been performed with satisfactoryresults within the specified time interval, the term ``verify'' is proposed.For example, Specification 4.10.D.1.b requires a shutdown margin demonstrationwhen two control rods are withdrawn from the reactor core for maintenance.Since the intent of the requirement is to perform a test, no change wasmade (demonstration was retained). In contrast, if a subsystem or componentis inoperable, the proposed change would delete the requirement to actuallyperform a test of redundant systems or equipment to prove operability ifthe surveillance tests have been performed within the required test interval(verify is used). This change does not affect the existing normal surveillancetesting requirements, nor does it affect the testing performed when equipmentis returned to service from an inoperable condition. Other proposed changes would incorporate related modifications to variousBases sections where needed. Also, Bases 4.5 would be modified to eliminatethe discussion concerning required testing which is based on the degreeof operability and nature of the reason for out of service equipment. Thiswould be replaced with: ``Consistent with the definition of operable inSection 4.0.C, demonstrate means conduct a test to show; verify means thatthe associated surveillance activities have been satisfactorily performedwithin the specified time interval.'' <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previouslyevaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee has evaluated the proposed amendment against the standardsprovided above and has made the following determination: <ITAG tagnum="21">A.

The licensee's analysis of significant hazards considerations follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">This amendment request is prompted by NRC letter, Heitner to Williams,dated 04/19/89 (G-89137). That letter advised PSC of the need for an amendmentto Facility Operating License No. DPR-34; to wit: ``The licensee is notauthorized to operate the reactor (above 5 percent of full power) for electricpower production after June 30, 1990.''

The earlyshutdown of Fort St. Vrain will have no adverse effects on any margin ofsafety. Inclusion of this amendment in the license is based on an NRC request.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Additionally, the restriction included in this proposed change prohibitingoperation above 2% of full power further avoids any significant hazardsconsideration. Although PSC does not intend to take the reactor criticalafter final shutdown, and unforeseen circumstances requiring criticalitywould be accommodated by the 2% power level restriction. Long term operationat 2% power or any other power level is not being proposed. Remaining below2% avoids any significant heat being added to the core. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination.

A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. In accordancewith 10 CFR 50.92 the licensee has reviewed the proposed changes and hasconcluded as follows that they do not involve a significant hazards consideration:<ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes to the [Hope Creek Generating Station (HCGS)]Technical Specifications: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. The maximum calculated accident pressure for the drywell is identifiedin UFSAR Section 6.2.1.1.3.1 as 48.1 psig (P(a)). This pressure is assumedto occur in the event of a design basis accident, a recirculation systemline break. UFSAR Section 15.6.5.5.1.2.2 assumes that the radiologicalconsequences associated with such an accident are in part limited by theintegrity of the primary containment. Since the subject valves form a partof the primary containment, it is necessary to periodically test theirleakage. The proposed change simply increases the hydrostatic test pressureand does not affect the 10 gpm TS leakage criteria nor alter the TS requiredactions in the event that such a limit is exceeded. Any leakage associatedwith the subject valves would still be into a closed system outside primarycontainment from which leakage is still processed and filtered by the Filtration,Recirculation, and Ventilation System (FRVS) in the Reactor Building priorto discharge to the environment. Again this change does not affect thefunction of the FRVS nor the leakage criteria from engineered safety featurescomponents outside the primary containment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">10 CFR 50, Appendix J, Paragraph III.C.2 requires a hydrostatic testpressure of 110% of the maximum calculated accident pressure. In the caseof HCGS, this requirement translates into a test pressure of 52.9 psig.However, the HCGS TS currently only specify. a test pressure of 1.0 P(a),48.1 psig; therefore, a TS change is necessary to comply with AppendixJ testing requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">From the discussion provided, PSEandamp;G has concluded that the proposedchange involves an additional limitation - namely that the subject valvesmust be capable of withstanding a test pressure 10% greater than that currentlyrequired while still only permitted to leak, in total, no more than 10gpm. Since the proposed change does not affect this leakage criteria northe actions required in the event the criteria is not met, PSEandamp;G hasconcluded that the proposed change does not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. PSEandamp;G has been and will continue to test and measure the leakageassociated with each containment penetration in order to assure that containmentintegrity is maintained. However, the wording of TS 3.6.1.2.e could bemisconstrued to require hydrostatic leakage from each in-series containmentisolation valve to be included in the total leakage criteria of 10 gpm.Such an interpretation ignores the fact that leakage associated with sucha penetration is calculated using the valve with the highest leakage. Therefore,the proposed change would provide sufficient clarity to correctly permitpenetration leakage rates to be used in the 10 gpm leakage criteria. Sincethis change does not affect the physical condition associated with penetrationleakage nor the criteria for total hydrostatic leakage, PSEandamp;G has concludedthat the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. The proposed change is administrative in nature and does not affectthe requirement to demonstrate operability of purge supply and exhaustvalves with resilient seals. Therefore, PSEandamp;G has concluded that theproposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes do not involve any plant modifications otherthan the increase in the test pressure for the subject valves. In addition,the testing configuration is not changing and the results of hydrostatictests must still meet the 10 gpm leakage criteria stipulated in the TS.The requirements specified in the associated TS Action Statements shouldleakage exceed the acceptance criteria are not affected by the proposedchanges. As a result, PSEandamp;G has concluded that the proposed changesdo not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes are necessary to: (a) comply with the requirementsof 10 CFR 50, Appendix J, (b) clearly indicate the method of determiningtotal hydrostatic leakage, and (c) correct administrative errors in theTS. As a result, the margin of safety is not compromised by the proposedchanges. In the case of the increased test pressure, an additional marginof safety is provided since testing hydrostatically sealed valves at atest pressure 10% greater than the maximum accident pressure provides greaterassurance that the maximum leakage expected from the valve(s) will notexceed conditions expected to occur during or following an accident. Asa result, PSEandamp;G has concluded that the proposed changes do not involvea significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As discussed above, PSEandamp;G has concluded that the proposed changesto the Technical Specifications do not involve a significant hazards considerationsince the changes (i) do not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (ii) do not createthe possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accidentpreviously evaluated, and (iii) do not involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. </ITAG>The staff reviewed the licensee's determination that the proposed licenseamendment involves no significant hazards consideration and agrees withthe licensee's analysis.

Specifically, the proposed amendment would involve TechnicalSpecification Sections 6.2.2b and 6.2.2c, licensed operator staffing, andTable 6.2-1. (Table 6.2-1 has been deleted per amendment No. 115). Theamendment requested that the appropriate Technical Specifications be revisedto reflect existing operating procedures which require at least one operatorto be in the control panel area when fuel is in the reactor, at least twolicensed operators, one of which is a licensed senior operator, to be inthe Control Room while the plant is in operational modes 1 thru 4, andat least two senior operators to be onsite while the plant is in modes1 thru 4. This request is in compliance with the NRC requirement addressedin 10 CFR Part 50.54, paragraphs (m) and (k) which address licensed operatorstaffing at nuclear power plants. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards, 10 CFR 50.92, for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee has provided the following analysis in support of a no significanthazards consideration determination: The proposed changes would not (1) involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated becausethe addition of the proposed changes increases both the number and qualificationrequirements of control room operators necessary to satisfy the minimumshift crew requirements. These changes support the likelihood of detectingabnormal events early enough to mitigate potentially adverse conditions.Also, the proposed changes would not (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated becausethese changes which increase control room staffing requirements do notcreate the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. Finally, the proposed changes would not (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety because the proposed changes increase the controlroom staffing requirements and, therefore, will not reduce the margin ofsafety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's proposed no significant hazardsdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis. Furthermore, the Commission has provided guidance concerning the applicationof criteria for determining whether a significant hazards considerationexists by providing certain examples of actions involving no significanthazards consideration (51 FR 7751). As stated in example (vii), ``A changeto conform a license to changes in the regulations, where the license changeresults in very minor changes to facility operations clearly in keepingwith the regulations.'' The proposed changes associated with this amendmentare within the scope of this example.

This table pertains to primarycontainment isolation valves not subject to Type C leakage tests. RHR-32and -33 are in a line that is closed off by a blank flange, thus, no longerrequire surveillance testing. Check Valve 10-29 is in a disconnected linethat no longer serves any function. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards determination exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated, or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated,or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has evaluated the proposed amendment against the standardsin 10 CFR 50.92 and has determined the following: <ITAG tagnum="21">The removal of the Reactor Vessel Head Spray Valves (RHR-32 and RHR-33)from Table 4.7.2.b of the Technical Specifications will simply remove therequirement to test the valves to ensure they will close if needed to isolatethe primary containment. Since the valves are maintained closed and thisamendment would remove the requirement to open the valves for these surveillances,further assurance is provided that the valves will remain in their isolatedposition. The removal of the check valve (10-29) from the Table will ensurecontinuity in the Technical Specifications in recognizing that the ReactorHead Spray function has been disconnected. Thus, the proposed change doesnot involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accidentpreviously evaluated. Operation of the RHR System is not reduced from existingrequirements and is still bounded by the assumptions used in the safetyanalysis, thus the proposed change does not create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any event previously evaluated.Elimination of subject surveillances will remove the requirement to openthe motor-operated valves, which will ensure that the integrity of thispenetration is maintained at all times. Thus, the proposed change involvesno decrease in any plant margin of safety. </ITAG>The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.

Section 103.c of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 authorizes the issuanceof facility operating licenses for a period of up to 40 years. The currentlicense term for the Vermont Yankee facility began with the date of issuanceof the construction permit, December 11, 1967, and ends on December 11,2007. Accounting for the four years and three months required for plantconstruction, this represents an effective operating license term of only35 years and 9 months. Current NRC policy is to issue operating licenses for a 40-year period,commencing with the date of issuance of the operating license. For VermontYankee, this date was March 21, 1972. Accordingly, it is proposed thatthe Vermont Yankee operating license be amended to change the expirationdate to March 21, 2012 consistent with current NRC policy and the originallyengineered design life of the plant. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c).

This extension is within the range permissible by the Commission'sregulations, specifically 10 CFR, Section 50.51. In addition, a findingof no significant hazards consideration is consistent with recent NRC actionson applications of this type. The proposed extension will have no significantimpact on the safe operation of the plant or present an undue risk to thehealth and safety of the public. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed license amendment to permit the 40-year operating lifedoes not constitute a significant hazards consideration as defined in 10CFR, Section 50.92 for the following reasons: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a.

Suchprograms assure that the Vermont Yankee facility will be operated as intendedby its design and the Technical Specifications.

As the report indicates, the projected population in the 50-milearea surrounding the Vermont Yankee facility is expected to remain unchangedduring the proposed amendment term. There are no changes to the exclusionarea boundaries, the increase in population in the Low Population Zoneis projected as being negligible, and the nearest population center isexpected to remain more than 1-1/3 times the current five-mile Low PopulationZone (LPZ) radius from the facility as required by 10 CFR 100.11(a)(3).Based on the results of this study, the off-site exposures from releasesdue to postulated accidents are expected to remain well within the limitsset forth in 10 CFR, Part 100. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Because there will not be significant changes in the population andits distribution surrounding the plant, and Vermont Yankee Nuclear PowerCorporation will continue to operate the plant in accordance with its designand Technical Specifications, the potential radiological consequences ofan accident previously evaluated remain unchanged. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed amendment will not result in an increase in the probabilityor the consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the FSAR because:(1) facility operations will be continued in accordance with the facility'sapproved design and Technical Specifications, and (2) changes to the populationand distribution surrounding Vermont Yankee are expected to be negligibleand will not impact on the previously determined LPZ boundary. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b.
