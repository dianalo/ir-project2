 Single user runtime $2,000 for a five-pack.andO;Multi-user runtime $1,500 for a five-pack.andP;  SOLWindows runtime $750 for afive-pack.andP;  SQR runtime $750 for a five-pack.andP;  Description: SQLBase is aStructured Query Language database server which runs on DOS or OS/2 serversand can have clients running DOS or OS/2.andP;  The DOS version uses NetBIOS tocommunicate.andP;  it can run in either conventional or extended memory.andP;  The OS/2version can use NetBIOS or Named Pipes.andP;  SQLWindows allows developers toquickly and easily develop Microsoft Windows-based applications for SOLBase.andM;Requirements: The DOS SQLBase database server uses a dedicated 286 or 386 PCon a LAN.andP;  Minimum requirements for the DOS server include a hard disk, atleast 1M byte o memory and PC-DOS 3.1.andP;  Minimum requirements for client nodof any IBM-compatible PC with 1M byte of memory, no hard disk and PC-DOS 3.1.andO;SQLBase runs on IBM Token Ring, IBM PC LAN Program, 3Com or anyNetBIOS-compatible network.andM;Database servers not only are good candidates for the development of LANsystems but also are flexible enough to support seamless integration intoboth the mainframe and minicomputer database systems arena.andM;One of the leaders in bringing SQL database server products to the PC LANenvironment is Gupta Technologies, based in Menlo Park, CA.andP;  At the heart ofGupta Technologies' product line is the SQL database server SQLBase.andP;  Firstshipped in 1986, SOLBase is multi-user, relational database.andP;  By early 1990,it will support gateways to DB2 and Oracle databases.andP;  SOLBase can operate onstandalone PCs or a network of PCs.andP;  From the beginning, SQLBase was designedand developed for the PC LAN and therefore it isn't as resource-intensive asthose servers which were ported to the PC from the minicomputer or mainframeenvironment.andP;  Software Development KitsandM;SQLBase consists of a series of Software Development Kits (SDKs).andP;  These SDKsconsist of the Single User DOS SDK, the Multi-user DOS SDK and the OS/2Multi-user SDK.andM;The Single User SDK consists of the following components:andM;* SQLBase Single User Database EngineandM;* SQLTalk - an interactive data manager for SQLBaseandM;* SQLWindows Application Development SystemandM;* ExpressWindows  Application GeneratorandM;* SQR Programmer's Report WriterandM;* SQL/API - Structured Query Language Application Programming interfaces andlibraries (C, Cobol and Windows)andM;The Multi-user SDK includes:andM;* SQLBase Single User Database EngineandM;* SQLRouter - a set of client-based router programsandM;* SQL/API - Structured Query Language Application Programming interfaces andlibraries (C, Cobol and Windows for DOS; C for OS/2 and Presentation Manager)andM;* SQLBase/SQLWindows Single User SDK (single workstation package)andM;The OS/2 Multi-user SDK includes:andM;* SQLBase OS/2 Multi-user Database ServerandM;* SQLBase OS/2 Single User Database ServerandM;* SOLRouter - a set of client-based router programsandM;* SQL/API - Structured Query Language Application Programming interfaces andlibraries (C, Cobol and Windows for DOS; C for OS/2 and Presentation Manager)andM;User SupportandM;The documentation for SQLBase is divided into six sections: installation andOperation, SOL Language, SQLTalk Commands, SQL/API Reference and ReleaseNotes.andP;  The SQLBase documentation serves as more of a reference manual than aguide for learning about the detailed intricacies of the product.andP;  However, afirst time user of SQLBase will do well by reading the entire SQLBase manual.andM;For those who require additional education on the use of SQLBase, Guptaoffers educational programs.andP;  Also, Que recently published the book &quot;SQLProgrammer's Guide&quot; by Umang Gupta and William Getz.andP;  This book contributessignificantly to reducing the learning curve for both SQL and SOLBase throughinteractive exercises that use the SQLTalk interactive Data Manager and theSQLBase database server Gupta Technologies publishes a series of documentscalled &quot;Technical Notes&quot; which are useful for discovering new techniques forusing its products.andP;  Finally, SQLBase comes with a series of demonstrationdatabases and tutorials that do a good job guiding you through your firstexperiences with a database server.andM;If, as you begin working with SQLBase, you need to contact technical support,you will discover that Gupta's technical support department is a verycourteous and responsive team.andP;  They seem to do a good job resolving anytechnical issues regarding the operational aspects of SOLBase.andP;  Gupta alsouses a sophisticated voice mail system when the technical line is busy, sothat messages can be left for its support engineers.andP;  Turnaround time onmessages is moderate.andM;Installing SOLBaseandM;Once you secure the appropriate SDK from Gupta, and after you digest themanual, the next step is to install SQLBase.andP;  installation of the DOS SQLBaseserver and its facilities is a simple, straightforward process.andP;  The OS/2version is a little more complex and requires a basic understanding of OS/2.andO;Gupta provides batch programs for automating the installation of the server.andO;Those who are installing a multi-user database server on a LAN would benefitfrom having the LAN administrator assist in the installation process.andM;The DOS SQLBase database server uses a dedicated 286 or 386 PC on a LAN.andP;  Inthe future, SQBase will run on the 486.andP;  Minimum system requirements for theDOS server include a hard disk, at least 1M byte of memory and PC-DOS 3.1.andO;We recommend at least 3M bytes of RAM.andP;  Minimum system requirements forclient nodes consist of any IBM-compatible PC with 1M byte of memory, no harddisk and PC-DOS 3.1.andP;  SQLBase runs on IBM Token Ring, IBM PC LAN Program,3Com or any NetBIOS-compatible network.andM;The SQLBase server and its client nodes reside on the network as separatenodes.andP;  These two nodes - the client and the server - communicate with eachother at the NetBIOS level and do not require the services of the networksoftware.andP;  One common misconception is that a client workstation must belogged into a file server before accessing the database server.andP;  This is notso with SQLBase.andP;  The LAN does not need to have a file server for the clientand server to interact.andP;  However, many organizations with LANs installed haveboth file servers and communications servers coexisting with SQLBase on thesame LAN.andP;  This provides the client with the maximum amount of resourcesavailable on the LAN.andM;By year end, Gupta will release a version of SQLBase that supports NamedPipes.andP;  This is an attractive feature for those interested in takingadvantage of Named Pipes on the LAN.andP;  Named Pipes support will pique theinterest of LAN Manager users, since it too uses Named Pipes.andM;Before starting SQLBase, you must initialize at least one database on thedatabase server.andP;  To initialize a database, you execute a batch program intowhich you pass the name of the database you would like to create.andP;  Thisprogram creates a subdirectory with the same name and copies the basedatabase information into the subdirectory.andP;  This base information consistsof system catalog tables for the proper operation of the database.andP;  if youwill be working with multiple databases, then you must initialize thesedatabases before working with them.andP;  Otherwise, your application will notrespond properly to your request to communicate with the database installedon the server.andM;SQLBase also contains an initialization file called DBSERVER.CFG orDBXSERVR.CFG depending on whether you are using the conventional memoryversion or the extended memory version of SOLBase.andP;  At initialization,SOLBase reads this configuration file from the directory where SQLBase isinstalled.andP;  This configuration file contains information pertaining to theallocation of buffers, identification of database and other systemparameters.andP;  The database server's administrator may want to review thisconfiguration file to determine its optimal settings.andP;  By fine tuning theparameters in this file, you may affect performance on the server.andM;Once the databases are initialized and your configuration file is adjusted,you  execute  the  program DBSERVER.EXE for the conventional memory versionor DBXSERVR.EXE for the extended memory version.andP;  When the server issuccessfully started, an informational display showing status informationwill appear on the server's monitor (See Figure 1).andP;  This screen has a greatdeal of information regarding the operational aspects of the server.andP;  Mostadministrators will operate production systems in the default setting whenthe server is initialized.andP;  Developers working in development or testenvironment will find the server display screen options a valuable asset whendebugging applications.andP;  One of the status screens shows the database serverhandling SQL request from the client application (See Figure 2).andP;  The SOL isactually displayed as it is handled by the server.andM;Before a client can hold a conversation with SQLBase, the appropriate routerprogram must be installed on the workstation.andP;  The program called DBROUTERenables a logical connection between a client and the server.andP;  Once thisconnection is established on the LAN, the client workstation program usesthis router program in conjunction with the client application to issue SQLrequests to the server.andP;  it also uses DBROUTER to receive records from theserver.andM;DBROUTER is installed o the client workstation as a memory-resident program.andO;Because the interface between DBROUTER and SQLBase is so tightly coupled,network traffic between the client and server is minimized.andM;Once the router program is installed, the client workstation can conversewith SOLBase using SQLTalk or an application that was designed and developedusing any number of the front-end products for SQLBase.andP;  included in thiscategory are Gupta's SQLWindows, a front-end application development productfor Microsoft Windows.andP;  SQLWindows is one of the most significant and mostinnovative products of all the front-end tools available for databaseservers.andP;  (See sidebar.) Another valuable front-end comes from PlanetSoftware.andP;  This tool gives Clipper developers the ability to interface theirClipper programs to the SQLBase database server through a set of APIs.andP;  Thisgives Clipper developers a good deal of freedom for developingdBASE-compatible applications that interface to a database server on a LAN.andM;Of course, it is only through SOL that conversations between these front-endsare possible.andP;  SOLBase supports industry-standard SQL syntax.andP;  This featureallows client applications written for SQLBase on PC LANs to maintain a highlevel of compatibility with IBM's DB2.andP;  This level of compatibility supportreduces the amount of time required for developers familiar with DB2 to getup to speed with using SQLBase.andM;One of the first things that can be done to test if the server is workingproperly is to install the router program and execute the interactive DataManager SQLTalk.andP;  it's a rewarding experience when you can create a database,insert data into the server, and query it from a client workstation.andO;Accomplishing this will help put you into the spirit of creating your firstclient-server application using SOLBase.andM;Data SafetyandM;SOL supports all the features you would expect from a high-end, relationalDBMS for a LAN-based multi-user environment.andP;  SQLBase supports integritychecking because the server can manage editing conditions via various typesof data constraints including uniqueness, nulls, fields and tables.andP;  BecauseSQLBase supports multi-user systems, it employs techniques to enforce dataconsistency during application access at the server.andP;  Consistency in thisregard means that a multi-user application can access information at theserver without another application modifying the same data after it is readby the original application.andM;As with a number of multi-user databases, locking techniques are used tohandle consistency within the application.andP;  in SQLBase, these include ReadRepeatability which is compatible with DB2, Read Only and Cursor Stability.andO;Having a high degree of consistency within your application using theselocking techniques might have an impact on the ability for applications toshare information concurrently.andM;The consistency versus concurrency dilemma can be resolved by usingisolation-level switching.andP;  isolation-level switching reduces the amount oftime various locks are held by the application.andP;  if found, this technique canbe applications developed using such products as SOLWindows, C and Cobol API.andO;Gupta does a very good job of explaining concurrency and consistency in itsdocumentation and Technical Notes.andM;Also supported are roll back and roll forward recovery.andP;  Any time a set ofSQL statements are issued to the database server, it is considered atransaction.andP;  When the user issues the SQL statement called COMMIT, thedatabase server knows that this transaction, or unit of work, is to becompleted.andP;  However, if the user decides to abort this transaction, he canoptionally issue a ROLLBACK statement.andP;  This statement causes the database toreturn to the state it was prior to the time the last COMMIT was issued.andO;Also, if a system failure occurs, SQLBase will support automatic roll backrecovery to the point where the last transaction ended.andM;A more disastrous situation is a hard disk crash or general media failure.andO;SQLBase addresses this situation by supporting the use of an automaticjournal log that keeps a record of all SOL transactions.andP;  You can use thisjournal, or the most recent backup, to return the database to the state itwas prior to the media failure.andP;  This journal log is normally stored on adifferent disk than the working copy of the database.andM;Jumping inandM;SQLBase's  interactive  data manager SQLTalk has a number of usefulutilities.andP;  You can load and unload bulk data directly into and out ofSQLBase.andP;  The commands for accomplishing this in SQLTalk are LOAD and UNLOAD.andO;Three formats of data are supported for this facility: SOL, ASCII and DIF.andO;This feature is helpful when existing data must be transferred from anothersoftware program to an SQLBase database.andP;  The UNLOAD command is used tomigrate information contained in SQLBase database to other databases orapplications.andP;  it was reassuring to know that with LOAD, we wouldn't have toreenter data that already existed in some of our Paradox tables into SOLBase.andO;We just used the ASCII LOAD and the Paradox tables were migrated intoSOLBase.andP;  it is also a useful utility for making backups of existing databaseon the server.andM;One of the most interesting features in SQLBase that is not normally found inother servers is its support of result set mode.andP;  This mode allows the userto use the result of one query as the basis for another query, hence the nameresult set.&quot; This mode provides a useful means for further refining yourqueries without having to go through tedious iterations of SOL.andP;  Also, ifanyone updates those results while in result set mode, the SOLBase servernotifies him or her of the change.andM;Developing For SOLBaseandM;That SQLBase can support both single-user development on a standaloneworkstation or multi-user development on a LAN gives the systems developer agreat deal of flexibility A developer does not necessarily have to own a LANto begin developing client-server applications.andP;  Also, those companies thatsupport work-at-home projects will find this environment very accommodatingfor their developers who are assigned to projects using the client-serverarchitecture.andP;  It, is nice to know that when you prepare to demonstrate aclient-server application using SQLBase to a high-level company executive,you don't have to sat up a network in his or her office.andM;To take advantage of this capability, the developer starts out using thelocal version of SOLBase which operates in either conventional or extendedmemory.andP;  Using any of the front-end development tools supporting SQLBase, thedeveloper writes and tests applications that operate against SQLBase on thelocal workstation.andP;  Upon completion, the application and databases can thenbe migrated to a LAN with little effort.andP;  Because a LAN-based client-serverapplication normally operates in a multi-user environment, it is importantthat the developer remembers to incorporate any of the concurrency handlingaspects of a multi-user user application into the single user application.andM;With such flexibility plus compatibility with DB2, a number of companies arepursuing the development of CICS Cobol applications for DB2 on the LAN usingthe SQL Precompiler for the MicroFocus Cobol Workbench and the API forSQLBase.andP;  Again, no LAN is needed to get started.andP;  Performance issuesandM;The performance of SQLBase depends on a number of variables.andP;  One is based onthe layout of the logical database design.andP;  it is imperative for a goodrelational model to exist prior to creating databases on a database server.andO;Without a good data model, applications build on database server technologywill suffer in performance, the inability to get information from thedatabase easily, and a possible maintenance nightmare.andM;Although very little discussion has taken place in regards to data modellingwhen talking about database server technology, I implement my databases usingthe Extended Relational Analysis (ERA) method of modelling.andP;  This provides mewith a simple and straightforward process for implementing a good, normalizedrelational database under SQLBase before using any of the front-enddevelopment tools.andM;Other performance variables include the way an application was designed andimplemented, the type of front-end development tools used, the hardware, andmore.andM;ConclusionandM;SOLBase has many more features, that if discussed, could take an entire issueof LAN Magazine.andP;  This article tried to give you a feel of the most importantfeatures of this high-powered relational database server.andM;We found SOLBase a feature-rich database server.andP;  SQLBase has good support offront-end development tools, flexibility in supporting DOS and OS/2, gatewaysupport to DB2 and Oracle, a strong interface for Clipper developers and theability for a programmer to develop applications with and without a LAN.andM;Organizations considering taking advantage of the client-server architectureshould take a serious look at the capabilities of this leading edgerelational database server as their server component.andM;Bob Zurek is a senior systemsandM;engineer at Linc Systems in Bloomfield, CT</TEXT></DOC>
