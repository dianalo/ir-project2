Authorities believe the bomb, which exploded while Sharon Rogerswas driving the van on March 10, might have been the work ofterrorists.   ``We don't know who did it. We just must realize that someone isout there who committed a very cowardly act,'' said Mrs. Rogers,whose husband, USS Vincennes Capt. Will C. Rogers III, on July 3gave the order to fire on the jetliner when it was misidentified byship radar operators as an attacking Iranian warplane. Iran vowedrevenge.   ``Together as a community we have to find out who it is so that(a car-bombing) doesn't happen to anybody else,'' Mrs. Rogers saidin a videotaped interview for Crime Stoppers.   ``It could be me last week, you tomorrow,'' she said.   The spot, which is intended to help find witnesses, includes are-enactment of Mrs. Rogers scrambling out of her van secondsbefore it burst into flames.   ``My life has been threatened, and that of my family has beenthreatened,'' she said. ``I have lost my job, I can't go back to myhome and my life has completely done a turnaround.''   Mrs. Rogers' shadow-darkened front is obscured by electronicscrambling in the video, which contains the most extensive publicstatement she or her husband has made about the bombing.   During the interview, not all of which will be shown in theCrime Stoppers segment, Mrs. Rogers describes what happened as shewas waiting at a San Diego intersection while driving to work.   ``I had been sitting at the red light maybe 20, 30 seconds whenI felt that I had been rear-ended ... by a car going very fast,''said Mrs. Rogers, who was not injured.   ``At the same ime, I heard an explosion. I opened up the door. Ismelled (something) burning. I got my seat belt off as quickly as Icould. I jumped out and ran around the back end of the van, where Isaw the back third of my van on fire.''   Mrs. Rogers and her husband have been in protected seclusionsince the bombing, which the FBI is investigating. Possible motivesthat agents have said they're checking include retaliation for thedowned Iranian airliner.   A week after the bombing, Mrs. Rogers was dismissed from her jobof 12 years at La Jolla Country Day School, which was the targetthe same week of a telephoned bomb threat that turned out to be ahoax.   In a letter received Saturday by parents of students at theexclusive private school, Headmaster Timothy Burns said Mrs. Rogerswas not allowed to return partly because of concerns that herpresence would create a military atmosphere and disrupt the campus'learning environment.
