(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Space workers and tourists stoodsilently Saturday for 73 seconds, the length of the fatal Challengerflight, to remember the seven astronauts who died in the fieryshuttle explosion three years ago.   About 350 peace activists marked the anniversary with a rallyoutside a Kennedy Space Center gate to protest the launch of DefenseDepartment payloads aboard space shuttles. Four women were arrestedfor trespassing when they deliberately walked into an off-limitsarea.   Tour buses stopped in their tracks, and engineers, techniciansand support crews halted activity as flags at the Kennedy SpaceCenter were lowered to half-staff at 11:38 a.m., the moment whenChallenger lifted off on Jan. 28, 1986.   ``It's an appropriate way to mark the occasion, leaving it to theindividuals on how they want to remember it,'' said Forrest S.McCartney, the center director.   Only about 1,000 of the center's 17,000 employees were at workSaturday, but hundreds of tourists joined them in the tribute.   Meanwhile, a Challenger memorial was dedicated Saturday indowntown Miami.   ``It wasn't until we lost Challenger that the American publicrealized that space travel is dangerous,'' said U.S. Rep. BillNelson, speaking at the Challenger Seven dedication at BayfrontPark. Nelson, a Florida Democrat, rode on a shuttle mission just twoweeks before the Challenger disaster.   The 105-foot white sculpture, shaped like a twisting girder, wasdesigned by Japanese-American artist Isamu Noguchi, who died inDecember.   On Friday, space workers at the cape paused briefly to honor theChallenger crew a day before the anniversary.   McCartney said in a televised message: ``We won't forget thesacrifice made by these seven fallen heroes. We promised them we'dpush on in the years to come, to fly the space shuttle again. ...We're fulfilling that promise.''   The peace activist demonstration was organized by the FloridaCoalition for Peace and Justice. Among those participating wasformer Apollo astronaut Ed Mitchell, who walked on the moon in 1971.   Mitchell told the group that military reconnaissance andnavigation satellites have a place in space because they help keepthe peace.   ``That's not true about putting weapons in space,'' he said,specifically mentioning the Strategic Defense Initiative programwhose goal is to deploy an anti-missile system in orbit.   Following an afternoon of speeches and songs, the demonstratorshad a peaceful confrontation with security guards at a center gatenear the headquarters building. After being warned that anyonepassing through the gate would be arrested, four women entered.   They were booked and given a court appearance date. Organizershad announced before the rally that some planned to trespass as partof the protest.   A group of men wearing Ku Klux Klan robes stood by to protestwhat the demonstrators were advocating.   Killed in the Challenger tragedy were Dick Scobee, Michael Smith,Judy Resnik, Ellison Onizuka, Ron McNair, Greg Jarvis andschoolteacher Christa McAuliffe.   McNair's brother, Eric McNair of Atlanta, said at a ceremony innearby Cocoa Beach Saturday and it is important to remember theChallenger explosion ``so we will not forget what happened,lessening the chances of it happening again.''   The accident was blamed on a faulty booster rocket joint thatallowed flame to escape and touch off the shuttle's external fueltank.   The three remaining shuttles were grounded for 32 months whilemodifications were made. Discovery made the first post-Challengerflight last September and was followed by Atlantis in December.   Discovery is being readied for another flight in late February,although engine turbopump problems could delay that mission.</TEXT></DOC>
