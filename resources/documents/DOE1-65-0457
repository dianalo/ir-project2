<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-65-0457 </DOCNO><TEXT>The claimed production by Mikheev of Md{sup 1+} in aqueous/alcoholic solutionshas not been confirmed by others. The authors are taking a new approachusing aprotic solvents. If Mikheev's work is correct, Md{sup 1+} shouldbe attainable by Zn reduction in such solvents. If Mikheev's work iscorrect, Md{sup 1+} should be attainable by Zn reduction in such solvents.If not it should be reduced to Md{sup 2+}. The oxidation state determinationwill be made by ion exchange techniques. They have shown the log K/subd/ for Cs{sup 1+} tracer vs log Na{sup 1+} concentration gives a slopeof -1 in a solution of benzonitrile containing NaClO{sub 4} as supportingelectrolyte. Similarly they have obtained a slope of -1 for Eu{sup 2+}(after reduction from Eu{sup 3+}) and Sr{sup 2+} tracers vs log Ba{sup2+} with BaClO{sub 4} as supporting electrolyte. Thus the reduction ofMd{sup 3+} to Md{sup 1+} can be established by exchanging against Na{sup1+} as supporting electrolyte and the reduction to Md{sup 2+} by exchangingagainst Ba{sup 2+} (using Amberlyst 15 or Nafion 117 resins). Resultsof the mendelevium experiments are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
