(Devil's Advocate) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Kelly-Bootle, Stanley.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>In last month's column, while trying to &quot;judge&quot; the &quot;correct&quot; plural form ofa &quot;compound&quot; noun (namely, my hyphenated surname) , I wrote that &quot;myinstincts as a native speaker of English (more on this next month) indicateKellyBootles, but the French seem to prefer  Chez les Kelly-Bootle'.&quot; It isnow next month, figuratively speaking (rather like those hi-tech ads thattell you tomorrow has already dawned), and I fully intend to keep mymore-on-this promise--or to carry out my expansionist threat, if that's theway you feel about the instincts of native speakers.andM;By the way, the habit of quoting&quot; random words, as in my opening sentence ismultiply inherited from two classes: the UNIX shell script andpost-structuralist literary theory.andP;  In the former, you play hide-and-seekwith the shell and kernel; in the latter (one of the few arenas where Marxismis winning) you obscure textual &quot;meaning&quot; in a conspiracy&quot; with the &quot;reader&quot;(less on this next month) .andM;I do not want the complexities of glosses, tenses, and unreal time frames tointrude on my exposition [So get on with it-Ed.andP;  ] , but you should be awareof the fact that as I write this, you will not yet have seen &quot;last month's&quot;column.andP;  [I'm still waiting to see this month's column-Ed.andP;  ].  I must choosemy tenses carefully.andP;  By the time you will have read this, you will have hadprevious exposure to the July column, and I will have been writing (futureimperfect?) a September offering (D.V).andP;  Perhaps I have not rendered theserare temporal auxiliaries quite correctly? Perchance a speaker &quot;nativer&quot; thanwhat I am is already throwing up on the carpet.andP;  Linguists are quite dividedon the whole question of &quot;correctness&quot;, the what, whence, and how-andespecially its relation to the instincts of the &quot;native speaker&quot;.andP;  Withunnatural languages such as Ada, the problem is less severe.andP;  A conformingcompiler judges your constructs-end of test.andP;  I have heard rumors fromDo-While Jones', however, that judging Ada-compiler conformance is not asstraightforward as originally planned-but I will defer discussion on thisuntil, let's say, the month after next, or even later.andM;Noam Chomsky wrote, &quot;The sentences generated will have to be acceptable tothe native speaker&quot; (Syntactic Structures, Mouton, 1957).andP;  Chomsky also usedthe word &quot;grammaticalness&quot;, which some anti-transformationalists unfairlyattacked as being &quot;non-native&quot;, compared to the canonical form,&quot;grammaticality&quot;! Lexicographer Tom Paikeday says, &quot;The native speaker is amyth propogated by linguists&quot; (The Native Speaker is Dead!, PaikedayPublishing, 19851).andP;  Tom seems to have been the first to complain that a termundefined in the leading dictionaries (Webster and OED) was being used toprop up both linguistic theory and job hiring requirements.andP;  Adverts forteachers of English that insist that the applicant be a &quot;native speaker ofEnglish&quot; have been successfully squashed by courts in Canada and the UnitedStates.andP;  But members of the Modern Language Association are now complainingthat native speakers&quot; of English are having trouble landing &quot;foreign&quot;language-teaching jobs.andM;The gist of Tom's book, developed from Platonic dialogs with Chomsky, Quine,Crystal, Halliday, and other fine philosopher-linguists, is that &quot;nativespeaker&quot; means neither more nor less than &quot;proficient user of a language&quot;.andO;Experiments have simply failed to distinguish the two species.andP;  Those whohave acquired a language at their mothers' knees occasionally  lapse&quot;, justas those who gained &quot;second-language&quot; fluency later in life sometimesstumble.andP;  The types of error (add your own quotes this time) do not provide aconsistent classification since they rely on the examiners' individualinstincts and grammaticality judgments.andP;  Incidentally, Tom himself writesabout a &quot;Finnish young lady&quot; (page 31, op.andP;  cit.) , which could fail him as anative speaker in those naive tests on the natural ordering of adjectivalclusters.andP;  Into each text some deconstruction must fall! (Which reminds methat, corresponding to the old antipalindrome, &quot;A Man, a Plan, a Canal,Suez!&quot; the current favorite is &quot;Named Derrida!&quot; [Hint: substitute &quot;Panama&quot;and &quot;De Man&quot;.] )andM;The Native Speaker Is Dead! ends with a rousing song by Professor Frederic G.andO;Cassidy, Chief Editor, Dictionary of American Regional English:andM;Hail to the Native Speaker,andM;He never can go wrong!andM;For by some process mystic,andM;Subliminal, sublinguistic,andM;And utterly spectacular,andM;He knows his own vernacularandM;To every last detailandM;-   He simply cannot fail!andM;Field-workers seeking to dissectandM;The structure of his idiolectandM;Occasionally may detectandM;What seems at first an odd effect,andM;Yet every item simply must belong:andM;The Native Speaker never can goandM;wrong!andM;Teems of TimesandM;Our native insights into tenses are fascinating.andP;  Take the familiar historicpresent: &quot;Way back in the 1950s, FORTRAN comes on the scene.andP;  People gowild!&quot; The future present also works: &quot;Tomorrow, Nick gives us Oberon++.&quot;andO;Damon Runyan (and the Hopi) uses the all-time present: &quot;Yesterday, I amwalking down Broadway and I meet Nicely-Nicely.andP;  Nicely-Nicely says that lastyear he is in Miami where this dame says she leaves for Paris next month.andP;  . andO;.&quot; Notice how, for the native speaker, the embedded temporal clues obviatethe need for &quot;traditional&quot; tense changes.andP;  Modern novelists explore a melangeof present-past-future-pluperfect with a hint of the subjunctive:andM;He lights another cigarette.andP;  SoonandM;she would arrive and he wouldandM;know that she had arrived justandM;as he had known, had alwaysandM;known, would always knowandM;The doorbell was silent.andP;  HeandM;catches a glimpse of himselfandM;in the mirror He lit anotherandM;cigarette if he had one.andP;  .  .andM;The native reader takes all this in stride! However, as pointed out by LuiseSchipporeit (Tenses and Time Phrases in Modern German, Max Hueber Verlag,Munchen, 1971), statements such as &quot;Ich habe lange nicht an Gott geglaubt&quot;underline the problems of acquiring &quot;instinctive&quot; linguistic knowledge bynon-natives.andP;  The naive translation by an English native-speaker armed with agood German-English dictionary would be (pass 1) : &quot;I have long not in Godbelieved&quot; leading to (pass 2): &quot;I've been an atheist for years (and remainso) &quot;.andP;  The true meaning is &quot;There was a (long) period in the past when I didnot believe in God, but now I do!&quot; The CHIP Special computer magazine,published by Vogel Veriag und Druck KG, Munchen, is negotiating to translatesome of my work into German, it seems.andP;  This very column might be aninteresting challenge.andP;  One is reminded of Russell's teaser: &quot;Translate intoGerman the sentence:  The word for 2 has three letters'.andM;Station BreakandM;And now, this: An incredibly tiny subset of the readers who write to ouresteemed Editor are irked by the fact that our 130-page UNIX magazineregularly includes two or three pages of material that is, in their view, notimmediately helpful in advancing their UNIX careers.andP;  I think that thisattitude is most unfair to Eric Allman and Ken Arnold, our two C Advisors.andO;in spite of increasing UNIX sophistication over the years (the kernel wassecretly rewritten in Common Lisp in 1988), several UNIX utilities stilldepend on the quirks of &quot;write-only&quot; C. This designation of ahard-to-maintain language was capped yesterday by Chuck Jazdzewski of Borlandwho dubbed COBOL a &quot;read-only&quot; language.andP;  Chuck naturally feels that TurboPascal qualifies as the only &quot;writeable-readable&quot; compromise.andP;  So, a &quot;CAdvisor&quot; column has every right to...andP;  [I must interrupt.andP;  It's your columnthey consider irrelevant, not the &quot;C Advisor&quot;! Goto main () -Ed.andP;  ].andM;As I was saying, that vanishingly small (almost everywhere dense) section ofthe readership who begrudge me my monthly flights of linguistic fancy seemunaware of Dijkstra's Edict: The prerequisite for all programmers is masteryof their Mother Tongue.andP;  The DoD Corollary says: Failing that, being a nativespeaker of Ada is the next best thing.andM;More Open StandardsandM;Elizabeth Altman, who edits my column so judiciously, was told by a Seikospokesperson that the company's new PostScript color printer supports theANSI-standard paper size-8 1/2' X 11'.&quot; Our technical editor, David Burnette,wonders if these specifications have been publicized sufficiently so thatothers may build on the standard.andP;  I do not recall being asked for my inputon the issue of paper-size standards, although I use paper almost every dayfor a variety of purposes.andP;  I was asked about a C construct that I have neverbeen tempted to employ: malloc(O).andP;  My response (amplified by Tom Clune ofERI) was that malloc(O) should work as follows: if no memory is available,the request is granted, returning a pointer to the byte beyond the heap; iffree memory exists, display the error message, &quot;Sorry, too much memoryavailable&quot;, and return the pointer to a vulnerable section of the user'scode.andP;  As King Lear used to say, &quot;Nothing can come from nothing, speakagain.&quot;andM;Speaking (again) of nothing, Mike Rejsa writes from Plymouth, MN, to suggestan interesting topic that straddles the computer-linguistic interface that weall love and detest.andP;  The Inuit have many names for snow, Mike points out,yet &quot;here in Minneapolis we know about snow, but that's all we call it.andP;  Whythen, do I find myself saying O, OL, '\O' NULL, (int *) 0, OXOO, OXOOOO,FALSE, etc.? Methinks this is much ado about nothing.andP;  .  .&quot; Methinks bothMike and Bill the Quill are wrong.andP;  I say: Multum in parvo! Ex nihilo fiatlux! Give me a good solid zero and I'll generate the integers.andM;Milken Math(s)andM;Michael Milken, the junked, cleanly collared bond dealer, is reported to havegiven a mathematics lesson last May to third-, fourth- and fifth-graders atan elementary school in New York City.andP;  No details were given but one wondersif the exercises included typical dealer calculations: X buys 100,000 sharesat $10 each and sells at them at $25.andP;  Assuming that three insiders are eachpaid $40,000, the Feds fine you $80,000, and you donate $50,000 to a localcharity, what's your net rake after taxes?andM;Next Month's Sneak PreviewandM;The Library of Computer andamp; Information Sciences (LCIS), Vol.andP;  25, Issue 4,reviews DB2: The Complete Guide to Implementation and Use (QED, secondedition 1989) by Jeff D.
