Permission to bring the suit before the High Court was grantedTuesday ``with some hesitation,'' Lord Justice Sir Tasker Watkinssaid. The full court hearing is expected by March.   The ban ordered Oct. 19 by Home Secretary Douglas Hurd barred theBritish Broadcasting Corp. and the Independent BroadcastingAuthority from carrying interviews with spokesmen for 11 groups,including the IRA and its legal wing, Sinn Fein; the Ulster DefenseAssociation and the Ulster Volunteer Force.   The suit is the first court challenge to the ban, and there havebeen no prosecutions for violating it.   Hurd's order, issued after an upsurge of IRA violence, alsobanned the broadcast of words that supported, or invited supportfor, the banned organizations. However, broadcasters remained freeto show pictures of the banned spokesmen and to paraphrase what theysaid.   The Irish Republican Army is fighting to end British rule inProtestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite the province withthe Irish Republic, which is predominantly Roman Catholic.   David Pannick, an attorney for the journalists and televisionproducers who sought to challenge the ban, argued that Hurd's orderwas illegal.   ``The directions are so perverse an interference with the freeflow of information in a democratic society that this restriction onthe freedom of expression is outside the discretionary powers whichwere conferred upon the Secretary of State by Parliament,'' Pannicksaid.   The court case is part of a campaign coordinated by the NationalUnion of Journalists against the restrictions. It is the main tradeunion representing press, radio, TV and magazine journalists inBritain and Ireland.   In November, the American Society of Newspaper Editors sent aletter to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, protesting the ban.   At the time the ban was announced, Hurd made it clear that theIRA and Sinn Fein were the primary targets, and that his intentionwas to deny them publicity.   ``What people hear on television is not the Sinn Fein politiciansbeing grilled by journalists. What they hear is supporters of SinnFein glorying in violence and death. That is what we propose tostop,'' Hurd said.   The challenge was brought by producers Don Brind of the BBC,Victoria Leonard of the London Broadcasting Company and AlexanderGraham; broadcast journalists Fred Emery, John Pilger and ScarlettMcGwire, who is also joint president of the National Union ofJournalists, and union clerk Thomas Nash.   In November, British authorities reportedly invoked the ban toprevent broadcast of a song by the popular Irish folk group ThePogues because its lyrics support 10 people convicted of IRAbombings.   The Observer, a London weekly, said Britain's IndependentBroadcasting Authority ordered all commercial radio stations not toplay the band's single ``Streets of Sorrow@Birmingham Six.''   The High Court is third highest on Britain's legal ladder. Thehighest court is the Law Lords of the House of Lords. Immediatelybelow that is the Court of Appeal.</TEXT></DOC>
