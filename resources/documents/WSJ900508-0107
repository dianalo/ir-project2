I plan to offer an amendment that seeks to preserve alevel playing field by requiring the president to negotiateequivalent environmental standards or trade adjustments withour international competitors.   Basically, this is neither an effort to protect ourinterests only, nor is it a violation of the spirit offairness and reciprocity. I am attempting to put this issueon the table now. Otherwise, it will haunt us later. Throughtrade negotiations, the U.S. can promote an environmentalagenda that not only equalizes trade inequities at theoutset, but also enhances global responsibility in solvingour pollution problems.   Rep. Alex McMillan (R., N.C.)   Washington   ---   You neglected to mention one sector that should ultimatelybenefit from more stringent emissions standards: thenuclear-energy industry.   According to the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, forevery 1,000 megawatts of generating capacity, a coal-firedutility will annually emit nearly 70,000 tons of sulfurdioxide, 25,000 tons of nitrogen oxide and 1.6 million tonsof carbon dioxide. The corresponding figures for natural gasare 17,000, 15,000 and 900,000 tons, respectively. Nuclearutilities discharge none of these pollutants, nor do theyemit carbon monoxide or methane.   Michael G. McGinty   Stamford, Conn.   ---   In my opinion, you covered the legislation in an unfairlynegative light. You state the costs to industry as $21billion, and remark that this exceeds the combined earningsof several major corporations. However, a fairer comparisonwould be with other costs of doing business. The sum of $21billion, which you present as staggering, will be passed onto consumers, and works out at less than $70 per capita, asum most of us would be happy to pay for clean air.   It is also unfair to present this as some sort of traumato the economy. This money is not (so to speak) vanishinginto thin air. It is going into new sectors of the economy,and represents an opportunity for new business andtechnology. Clean air, and other environmental legislation,is not a blow to the economy, but a shift in the economy,something that occurs all the time for all sorts of reasons.True, it will be bad for high-sulfur coal mining, and I forone would be happy to pay for transitional compensation andretraining for those affected. But we cannot refuse to makeimportant social transitions because they carry short-termcosts for certain sectors of the economy. Did anyone suggestwe shore up the horse-drawn buggy business because it wasthreatened by the automobile?   Clean technology is the wave of the future because cleanis the way people prefer to live. Custom is not good enoughreason for doing the wrong thing. In fact, the trouble withthe Clean Air Act is that it doesn't go nearly far enough.If, instead of focusing on reducing tailpipe emissions, theauto industry had chosen to boost fuel economy, something forwhich ample technology already exists, we could have begun tocontrol not just ground-level air pollution but greenhousegases as well. It's time American business divorced itselffrom the status quo and realized that the greatest benefitswill come from moving ahead.   Elizabeth Feuer, M.D.   Colts Neck, N.J.   ---   Acid rain is not, as your article suggests, some small,isolated problem related only to the Northeast. Its effectsare being felt throughout the country (Mountain Lake, at anelevation of 3,500 feet, in the western mountains ofVirginia, is acid-rain dead) and the world. We are nottalking about a minor problem for the 1990s. We are facingour future.   Industry will continue to drag its collective feet as longas earnings per share govern performance. When will trusteesand stockholders wake up like most citizens and realizehigher costs are inevitable if we are to survive?   William S. Gardiner   Williamsburg, Va.</TEXT></DOC>
