Aylwin said he would meet with the military service commanders,who have ruled Chile since a coup in September 1973, to establish aworking relationship.   Scattered disturbances broke out Friday in downtown Santiago.   Groups of young leftists threw rocks at police, who respondedwith water cannon and tear gas. Skirmishes scattered shoppers andhalted traffic several times on the principal boulevard, AlamedaAvenue.   The protesters demanded immediate release of leftists imprisonedon charges of political violence, including many accused ofguerrilla activity. Police reported at least 20 arrests.   Aylwin soundly defeated two opponents in Thursday's election. Ata news conference, he pledged to ``exercise the full powers of thepresident, and the armed forces must be subordinate and obedient tothe president.''   Later Friday, Aylwin told hundreds of thousands of supporters ata Santiago rally that the armed forces' political role ``must endin March'' when he takes over. ``We want to see the armed dedicatedto their professional duties, disciplined, obedient, thusrecovering the respect of all their compatriots.''   His comment went to the heart of one of the new civiliangovernment's most difficult and sensitive problems: theconsiderable power that still will be held by the armed servicecommanders, particularly Pinochet as head of the 60,000-man army.   A special provision of the constitution Pinochet's governmentwrote in 1980 says the commanders cannot be dismissed until 1998.   Aylwin, 71, won 55.2 of the 7 million votes cast Thursday, asthe candidate of a 17-party alliance of the center and left. HernanBuchi, the pro-government candidate, got 29.4 percent and FranciscoJavier Errazuriz, a wealthy enterprenneur, 15.4 percent.   Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state, said inWashington: ``We are enthused ... that (the elections) were freeand fair. We are very, very pleased that Chile has returned todemocracy.''   In Brussels, the European Community hailed Aylwin's victory as``the return of a great and friendly country ... to the path offreedom.''   At his news conference, Aylwin said: ``Chile is effectivelymoving back to democracy. There will be no puppet democracy, andthere will be no extra-democratic control over my government.''   He said he would talk with military leaders ``as soon ascircumstances permit.''   Under the new government, the military will have a majority on aNational Security Council empowered to ``represent'' its views tothe government. In addition, a bill now being discussed byPinochet's junta would give the armed forces substantial autonomyunder the civilian leadership.   Aylwin expressed confidence that ``a reasonable formula'' couldbe found, but declared: ``Nothing will prevent me from fullyexercising the presidential powers.''   One of the most delicate issues in future military-civilianrelations is expected to be how Aylwin handles the investigation ofhuman rights abuses under the Pinochet regime.   ``We don't have a wish of revenge, but of truth and justice,''he said Friday. He also said anyone who committed abuses may bebrought to justice, including Pinochet.   The 74-year-old general says he will not accept human rightstrials of military men, and has issued a clear warning: ``If one ofmy men is touched, the state of law will be broken.''   After overthrowing President Salvador Allende, an electedMarxist who died during the coup, the military embarked on severerepression of leftists who had supported him. Thousands werearrested, many tortured or killed and others forced into exile.   In his campaign, Aylwin emphasized plans to lead a government ofnational unity that would attempt to overcome bitter social andpolitical divisions created by the coup and military rule.   He indicated Friday that he would seek support from conservativegroups to repeal or make democratic changes in laws enacted by thejunta. Aylwin was careful to declare, however, that he would governwith the 17 parties of the alliance he led to victory.   His alliance will have a 72-48 majority in the 120-seat House ofDeputies. It won 22 of the 38 elected Senate seats, but Pinochet'sconstitution gives his government the right to appoint up to 10more senators.   Complex election laws written by the junta caused many leftistcandidates to lose their races despite getting more votes thanrightist opponents.   Aides to Pinochet said the laws were designed to ensure ahealthy minority presence in Congress. Opponents said the purposewas to prevent changes in the constitution, which require atwo-thirds vote in both houses.</TEXT></DOC>
