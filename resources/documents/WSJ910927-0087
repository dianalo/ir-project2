The action by the department's Occupational Safety andHealth Administration puts a spotlight on the sharp increasein workplace deaths at GM during the past two years. It'salso the first time the agency proposed the sharply highermaximum penalties allowed in &quot;egregious&quot; cases under a newsystem of bigger fines authorized by Congress late last year.</LP><TEXT>   A GM spokeswoman said &quot;we're very disappointed andconcerned&quot; by the citation.   GM has seen deaths in its North American operations jumpfrom a combined total of eight in 1988 and 1989, to acombined total of 16 in 1990 and 1991 to date, a companyspokesman said. The latest fatality occurred Sept. 15, when amaintenance worker at GM's Kalamazoo, Mich., metal stampingplant died after becoming entangled in a machine thattransferred car doors between stamping presses. The accidentstill is being investigated by OSHA and GM, as is usual insuch cases.   United Auto Workers officials have expressed dismay at therise in fatalities, arguing GM management should step upenforcement of safety rules. Steve Featherston, president ofthe UAW local that represents Oklahoma City, said yesterdaythe union hopes the OSHA action &quot;spurs this plant and everyplant to press harder for safety. A lot of places have dodgedthe bullet for years.&quot; GM Chairman Robert C. Stempel, in anaddress last week to employees on the overall state of thecompany, urged workers to &quot;take an active role in safety andfollow established procedures.&quot; He didn't specificallymention the recent fatalities.   The OSHA citation charges that GM officials in OklahomaCity didn't follow the agency's so-called lockout/tagoutregulation. That 1989 rule generally requires that employersuse locks to ensure that machines being serviced can't beturned on inadvertently. Use of warning tags, often withrigorous restrictions, is permitted in certain situations.   The accident at GM's Oklahoma City assembly plant occurredin April, when a maintenance employee working on a conveyorline died of head injuries suffered when a pneumatic liftunexpectedly started running -- one type of occurrence thelockout regulation was designed to prevent.   The regulation has proven controversial. In July, afederal appeals court ordered OSHA to justify the standard,on an appeal of the rule by the National Association ofManufacturers. The appeals court said OSHA had given itselftoo much leeway in deciding what amounts to &quot;significantrisk&quot; to a worker, and ordered the agency to use acost-vs.-benefits analysis or some other method to determinesuch a risk. The agency also was ordered to considerassertions by the association and auto makers that itabruptly changed from proposing either lockouts or tagouts toissuing a final rule that mainly requires lockouts.   OSHA cited GM for 57 willful violations of the standard atthe Oklahoma City plant, including 50 failures to train orretrain workers and three instances of inadequate proceduresfor controlling power for operating equipment.   &quot;Plant management had essentially ignored the requirementsof the standard,&quot; said Gerard Scannell, assistant secretaryof labor for OSHA. He said that a joint GM-United AutoWorkers training program was developed as early as 1985 and1986 but that it was never put into practice on theproduction floor. He also said the training program was neverupdated, even after OSHA issued the new rule.   Mr. Scannell said the Oklahoma City plant developed ahistory of hazards, accidents, near misses and failure tocomply with corporate and plant directives, along withfailure to carry out a power-control program. He noted UAWtestimony submitted during OSHA's rule-making for the newstandard that showed GM had 23 nationwide workplacefatalities between 1973 and 1978 related to failures to lockor tag powered machinery.   GM has 15 working days to contest the citation and theproposed fines before an independent Occupational Safety andHealth Review Commission.</TEXT></DOC>
