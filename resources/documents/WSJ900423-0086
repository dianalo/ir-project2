The Bush administration hasn't yet initiated negotiationsbecause &quot;the mood wasn't right&quot; and talks would have beencounterproductive, Mr. Darman told reporters. &quot;The mood ismoving,&quot; he said. &quot;It's moving slowly, but it's gettingthere.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The sticking points in any talks are likely to be how muchto cut the defense budget beyond what President Bush hasproposed, how to restrain growth in entitlement programs suchas Medicare, and what taxes to raise.   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.)said he favors a prompt start to negotiations only if allsides display willingness to work toward a significantpackage. &quot;There's concern that a lot of hope could be raised,but that talks only lead to another slide-by budget,&quot; hesaid. He said the president's continued public opposition totax increases is an obstacle.   Even before talks begin, the White House appears to belosing control over the size and shape of cuts in defensespending. Without a revised, long-term blueprint from thePentagon, lawmakers already are drafting plans for the mostfundamental changes in military spending in more than twogenerations.   Not only does the House Budget Committee seek to slashPentagon spending authority $24 billion below theadministration's fiscal 1991 request, but the Chairman of theSenate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), isnow leading the fight to postpone or cut substantially someof the military's most prized high-tech programs, includingthe MX nuclear-tipped missile and the Trident submarine.   In a long-awaited speech, Sen. Nunn, usually a strong allyof the military, said he wants to keep actual Pentagonoutlays in fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1, at $297 billion,only $1.5 billion higher than the House committee proposedand $6 billion below the Bush budget.   Mr. Darman insists that congressional appropriationscommittees are unlikely to agree to such deep cuts, and hepredicted that many House members will object once theyrealize how their own districts would be affected.   Over five years, Sen. Nunn seeks to cut as much as $255billion in budget authority from the Pentagon's wish list. Heenvisions withdrawing nearly all front-line Army troops fromWestern Europe by 1996 and eliminating most of the service'sheavy-tank forces; retiring hundreds of older helicopters andsurveillance planes; and mothballing dozens of ships andreducing the Navy's traditional presence in every hemisphere.   In sharp contrast to Pentagon plans to exempt mosttraining and maintenance accounts from deep cuts, Sen. Nunnsaid the services could save billions by scaling backtraining maneuvers and relying more heavily on simulators totrain aircraft and tank crews.   Sen. Nunn, intent on increasing competition between theservices for funds, said the Navy could save $15 billion overthe next five years by modestly trimming the amount of timeits ships are at sea. More than twice that much could besaved by slower replacement of U.S. long-range nuclearforces, the Georgia lawmaker said, and cutting theadministration's ambitious plans to expand spending to deploya space-based antimissile system. He didn't specificallydetail the production cuts he intends to propose for the AirForce's controversial B-2 Stealth bomber.   Meeting with reporters Friday, Mr. Darman reiteratedwarnings that the current economic slowdown is increasing theamount of deficit reduction that must be achieved to avoidacross-the-board spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law.   He now figures negotiators will need to find at least $45billion -- about $8.5 billion more than the administrationoriginally calculated -- in lower spending or higher revenueto meet the Gramm-Rudman target of $64 billion. If theeconomy returns only gradually to the path that theadministration forecast in January, an additional $12 billionin deficit reduction may be needed, he said. The precisefigure will be set by the revised economic forecast theadministration is to issue in July.   Mr. Darman dismissed the budget plan approved last week bythe House Budget Committee as one that doesn't even meet thestandards set by Chairman Panetta. &quot;It's a slide-by budget ofjust the type that he has criticized and lamented,&quot; Mr.Darman said.   Rep. Panetta said all sides are now staking out bargainingpositions. Despite controversy over the defense budgetrecommended by his committee, he expects the full House toapprove the panel's plan this week.</TEXT></DOC>
