Wall Street professionals are buzzing over the $23 millionin salary and bonus paid to Lawrence E. Hilibrand, abespectacled 31-year-old &quot;rocket scientist&quot; or high-techtrader, in Salomon's bond-arbitrage group. The figure wasconfirmed Friday by a person with knowledge of the operationsof the securities firm.</LP><TEXT>   Some other top Salomon employees, including at least oneother member of the bond-arbitrage group, are said to havemade more than $10 million each last year. One of theseemployees is said to be Andrew J. Hall, an oil trader andpresident of Salomon's Phibro Energy Inc. unit, but thatcouldn't be confirmed. Nor could it be determined exactly howmuch of these employees' paychecks was in cash and how muchin Salomon stock.   The paychecks are more than what the chief executives ofmost major U.S. corporations make, and they are some of thelargest on Wall Street since the heyday of deposed junk-bondking Michael Milken, who made $550 million in 1987 at DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc.   Salomon's big bonuses reflect big profit at the securitiesfirm, which reported net income of $318 million for 1990'sfirst nine months. Salomon's profit -- which comes when manyWall Street firms are taking losses -- results from itstraditional prowess in trading oil, bonds and othersecurities, and commodities.   But the fat paychecks for traders have sparked howls ofprotest from some Salomon investment bankers. Some bankershave taken pay cuts, reflecting a slowdown on Wall Street inmergers and acquisitions, corporate finance and otherinvestment-banking businesses. Salomon investment bankershave had to make do with a bonus pool 18% to 20% below a yearearlier, people familiar with the company say.   Unlike the seat-of-the-pants traders of days gone by,high-tech traders like Mr. Hilibrand employ rigorousmathematical methods to determine the appropriate pricerelationships between bonds, bond futures and bond options.   According to people at Salomon, the bond-arbitrage groupmakes its money by making huge bets -- positions totalingbillions of dollars -- on tiny price discrepancies betweendifferent securities. The group takes advantage of Salomon'sfranchise as Wall Street's biggest bond-trading firm, withaccess to the best information on such market-moving factorsas supply and demand.   Mr. Hilibrand, who became Salomon's youngest-ever managingdirector four years ago at age 27, didn't return calls to hisoffice Friday.   A spokesman for Salomon said the firm wouldn't comment onthe compensation of individual employees. He noted that asmuch as half the compensation of Salomon's major contributorsis paid in Salomon common stock and is deferred for fiveyears.   The paychecks of Mr. Hilibrand and some of his colleagueshave been a source of some embarrassment to Salomon ChairmanJohn H. Gutfreund and President Thomas W. Strauss, accordingto people at the firm. The two top executives agreed to paymembers of the tiny bond-arbitrage group based on a fixedformula tied to the group's profit, the people say. Theprofit was unexpectedly high during Salomon's compensationyear, which runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30.   The arbitrage group's pay plan is believed to be uniquewithin Salomon and wasn't known to the firm's otherdepartments until Mr. Gutfreund disclosed it at a meeting oftop Salomon executives last month, Salomon employees say.   The bond-arbitrage group works for John Meriwether, aSalomon vice chairman famous for outbluffing Mr. Gutfreund inthe opening chapter of &quot;Liar's Poker,&quot; the bestsellingprofile of Salomon written by a former employee, MichaelLewis.   The arbitrage group's arrangement is said to entitle itsmembers to 15% of the group's profit. Other employees arepaid based on a more subjective evaluation of how they, theirdepartment and the entire firm did.   One person who attended the meeting of top Salomonexecutives last month said that &quot;it was a difficult momentfor John. Nobody knew about the deal, and nobody else hadthat kind of deal.&quot; Another Salomon employee added, &quot;It couldbe quite disruptive&quot; within the firm.   The bond-arbitrage group's bonus pool was reported to be$60 million by Investment Dealers' Digest, a trade magazine.People familiar with the firm confirmed the total. At 15% ofprofit, the size of the pool indicates the group generated$400 million in profit.   While Mr. Hilibrand's share was the largest, the group'sother principal members include Eric Rosenfeld, GregoryHawkins, Victor Haghani and Peter Dagher. Messrs. Hawkins andHaghani recently were named Salomon managing directors. Oneperson knowledgeable about the firm's operations said atleast one of the other members made more than $15 million,and said the group's top five members, including Mr.Hilibrand, shared 90% of the $60 million bonus pool.   The bond-arbitrage group, which has about a dozenprofessionals, works at a desk on the firm's cavernous41st-floor bond-trading arena, the model for one of thesettings in Tom Wolfe's &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities,&quot; thenovel about Wall Street greed.   To illustrate how the bond-arbitrage group works, oneSalomon employee described a sample arbitrage transaction. Hesaid the group might create a &quot;synthetic&quot; 10-year Treasurybond by acquiring a series of bond futures. If the groupcould create the synthetic bond for $990 and simultaneouslysell the bond itself in a separate transaction for $1,000, itcould realize a profit once the prices of the two instrumentsconverge. The group also may create other arbitrage positionsinvolving interest-rate swaps, another employee said.   When Mr. Hilibrand was made a managing director four yearsago, he was responsible for trading interest rate futures andoptions. He joined Salomon in 1980 after receiving anundergraduate degree in mathematics and a master's degree ineconomics, both from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   Some Salomon employees complain that the pay formula couldencourage the bond-arbitrage group to make excessively riskybets with the firm's capital -- particularly since the groupisn't believed to share in any of the firm's losses under itspay formula. Indeed, Salomon's profit suffered in the firstquarter of 1989 when the arbitrage group is said to have lostmoney. (The group offset those losses with other profitablequarters in 1989, Salomon officials note.) Two peoplefamiliar with the firm questioned whether the group wasproperly charged for the use of the firm's capital and creditrating. Salomon's spokesman says that senior managementcontinues to set and monitor the firm's risk.   The bond-arbitrage group's hefty profit also could raisequestions in the minds of some of Salomon's clients aboutwhether the money was made at their expense. More than mostother Wall Street firms, Salomon has a culture that favorstrading over investment banking, and its traders make nosecret of their goal of making money in trades with clients.Salomon, for its part, says studies show its bond clients arepleased with the firm's service.   Some Salomon executives speculate that the arbitrage groupmay have been able to negotiate the profit-sharing formula bythreatening to leave, since the group has generated bigprofits in the recent past. One person knowledgeable aboutthe firm confirmed that such a threat was made. SaysSalomon's spokesman: &quot;That's just not true at all.&quot;   The rumored pay of the Phibro oil trader, Mr. Hall,appears to be a more straightforward result of the huge increases in oil prices that followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion ofKuwait. For 1990's first nine months, Phibro earned $422million before taxes, up 74% from 1989's nine months,including a record pretax $369 million in the third quarter.The 39-year-old Mr. Hall declined to comment on hiscompensation. He has been at Phibro since 1981 and has servedas president since 1987.   In 1989, Phibro Chairman Ernst Weil made $6.4 million insalary and bonus, compared with $3.5 million for Mr.Gutfreund. Even then, Mr. Meriwether is said to have made asmuch as $8 million. But as a senior Salomon executive, Mr.Meriwether wasn't part of the bond-arbitrage group'scompensation agreement.</TEXT></DOC>
