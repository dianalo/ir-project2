The W-value showed an oscillatory variation at the C/sub 1s/-andgt; {pi}* excited state as well as the C-K edge. A model has been proposedin which the inner-shell excitation gives rise to a change in the energyof the electron ejected from the molecule having absorbed a photon. Ithas been found that the model can reproduce the oscillatory variationfeature of the W-value.</TEXT></DOC>
