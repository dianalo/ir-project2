Duringthis period, investigators were principally interested in how well anair quality model simulated the dispersion of trace gas emission. Interestin the evaluation of heavier-than-air vapor dispersion models is a morerecent development. A variety of statistical techniques and other measuresfor assessing the performance of air quality models have been proposed.This paper presents a review of these methods, which have been met withboth acceptance and criticism within the scientific community, and proposesadditional methodologies, especially geared toward the evaluation ofreal-time accident response models. Since the emergency response manager(ERM) is the one who uses the assessment generated by these models, themajor focus of the ideas discussed in this paper revolved around theneeds and requirements of the ERM. 35 refs., 19 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
