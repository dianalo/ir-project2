The high court ruled that state laws barring garnishment of employee benefit plans are pre-empted by federal law, which the court interpreted to allow garnishment.    Employee benefit plans generally provide health, vacation, legal or job-training benefits, and most plans offered by private employers are subject to Labor Department regulation through the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.    In an opinion by Justice Byron White, the high court ruled that a Georgia law can't shield worker benefit plans from collections by creditors of employees who participate in the plans.    The Georgia law prohibits collection agencies or other creditors from garnishing employee benefits that are covered by federal law. The law was invoked by 23 longshoremen to prevent the Lanier Collection Agency andamp; Service Inc. from collecting money the workers owed to creditors. The workers are covered by a plan for longshoremen in Georgia, Florida, and North and South Carolina.    The Georgia Supreme Court ruled that the state law was invalid because federal law permits garnishment of benefit plans. The U.S. Supreme Court Friday agreed that under federal law garnishment of benefits is allowed in state courts.    Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented, joined by Justices Harry Blackmun, Sandra O'Connor and Antonin Scalia.    Lawsuit Deadline -   The justices struck down, 8-1, an Ohio law that denied out-of-state corporations the benefit of Ohio's limit on the length of time in which lawsuits may be filed in state courts. In an opinion written by Justice Kennedy, the high court ruled that the Ohio law interferes with interstate commerce.    The Ohio law says that suits against Ohio companies must be filed within four years of the occurrence that prompted the legal action. After four years, a suit is barred. But a company that agreed to perform a contract in Ohio but has no office there faces an indefinite period in which it can be sued. The high court said the law discriminates against companies that don't have Ohio offices.    The high court, affirming the decision of a federal appeals court in Cincinnati, ruled in favor of Midwesco Enterprises Inc., an Illinois company, in its dispute with Bendix Autolite Corp., now part of Allied-Signal Inc.    Chief Justice William Rehnquist dissented.    Disqualified Judge   The high court ruled 5-4 that a federal judge who is unaware of a possible conflict-of-interest should disqualify himself when he learns the problem exists, even if it means throwing out a verdict after the trial. </TEXT></DOC>
