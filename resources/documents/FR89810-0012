Background</ITAG>On February 23, 1989, the Commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking(NOPR) \4\<NOTE/> proposing to revise its regulations for carrying out wellheadpricing refund requirements under the NGPA. The NOPR was issued in responseto an audit of the Commission's wellhead pricing refund program conductedat the Commission's request by the Office of Inspector General, UnitedStates Department of Energy.\5\<NOTE/> The audit report concluded that, overall, first sellers donot refund overcharges or file refund reports in a timely manner. The auditreport attributed these delays primarily to the lack of specific time limitsfor first sellers to make refunds and reports for all types of refundsother than for interim collections under andSection; 273.302 of the Commission'sregulations,\6\<NOTE/> and the absence of penalty actions for late refunds or latereports. The NOPR proposed specific time limits to make and report refunds.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ 54 FR 8557; Mar. 1, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Inspector General,The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Wellhead Pricing Refund Program,No. 0259 (Sept. 29, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Section 273.302, which applies to the obligation to refundinterim collections, specifies the timing for making and reporting refunds;andSection; 270.101, which applies to all other refund obligations, doesnot.Specifically, the NOPR proposed to require first sellers to pay refundsunder andSection; 270.101 within 60 days after being notified that a refundis due or becoming aware that a refund is due, unless the refunds wererecovered by purchasers through a billing adjustment. A new provision alsowould be added in andSection; 270.101(e) to allow recoupment of a refundby purchasers through such a billing adjustment. The NOPR also proposedto require first sellers to file refund reports withn 90 days after beingnotified of a refund obligation or becoming aware that a refund is due,unless the refund was recovered through a billing adjustment.Additionally, the NPR proposed to revise the regulations governing stripperwells to specifically require refunds and reports after disqualificationof a stripper well.\7\<NOTE/> Under the proposal, a provision would be added to andSection;271.805(f) of the Commission's regulations to require a well operator tocomply with the new refund and report provisions, added in andSection; 270.101(e),when a petition for a jurisdictional agency stripper well determinationunder andSection; 271.806 or a motion contesting disqualification of a stripperwell is denied or withdrawn. In the case of refunds due to disqualificationof a stripper well, new provisions in andSection; 271.805(g)(2) also wouldrequire that a first seller refund all amounts collected in excess of themaximum lawful price, with interest, within 180 days after the last dayof the disqualifying 90-day or 12-month period,\8\<NOTE/> unless the first seller has filed a petition for a jurisdictionalagency stripper well determination under andSection; 271.806 within 150 daysafter the last day of the disqualifying period, or unless the refund hasbeen recovered through a billing adjustment in accordance with andSection;270.101(e). Compliance with the interim collection refund requirementsunder andSection; 273.302 would not eliminate this refund obligation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Under andSection; 271.805(f), an operator who files eithera petition under andSection; 271.806 for jurisdictional agency stripper welldetermination, or a motion contesting the disqualification of a stripperwell, may collect, subject to refund, the stripper well maximum lawfulprice.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ <T3>See</T3> 18 CFR 271.805(a) and (b) (1988).As proposed, andSection; 271.805(g)(2) also would require a first sellerto file either a refund report or a statement that no refunds are due,with each to be accompanied by a purchaser concurrence, within 210 daysafter the last day of the disqualifying 90-day or 12-month period.\9\<NOTE/> The first seller would not be required to make a refund report,however, if a refund was recovered by an interstate pipeline purchaserthrough a billing adjustment.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ When no petition is filed under andSection; 271.806 within150 days from the last day of the disqualifying period, the first sellermust make refunds within 30 days from that date and file a refund reportwithin 60 days of that date.Nine comments were filed in response to the NOPR.\1\\0\<NOTE/> After consideration of the comments, the Commission is adoptingthe NOPR's proposal with changes as described below.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ Individually, ARCO Oil and Gas Company (ARCO); ArkansasPublic Service Commission (Arkansas); Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation(Columbia); El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso); Exxon Corporation (Exxon);Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee Gas); and United Gas Pipe LineCompany (United). Jointly, ANR Pipeline Company and Colorado InterstateGas Company (ANR andamp; CIG) and 13 sellers of natural gas (Sellers). Sellersinclude Texaco Inc.; Amoco Production Company; BP Exploration Inc.; ChevronU.S.A. Inc.; Conoco Inc.; Hunt Oil Company; Marathon Oil Co.; Maxus EnergyCorporation; Mitchell Energy Corporation; Mobil Natural Gas Inc.; PhillipsPetroleum Company; Phillips 66 Natural Gas Company and Shell Oil Company.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Discussion</ITAG>A. Refund Period<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Section 270.101(e)</ITAG>The Commission proposed revising the refund regulations in andSection; 270.101(e)to require a first seller to pay refunds within 60 days after being notifiedthat a refund is due or becoming aware that a refund is due, unless therefund is recovered through a billing adjustment. Commenters claim thatthis 60-day time period is too short. Exxon argues that the Commissionshould adopt a 120-day time period, while Sellers argue that the periodfor making refunds or billing adjustments should be 180 days. They andARCO maintain that a longer period is necessary to retrieve, assemble,and evaluate the records essential to ensuring that the refunds are basedon accurate documentation rather than mere estimates.Sellers also request that the Commission establish procedures for extendingthe time period whenever a first seller cannot in good faith determinethat refunds are due or whenever a first seller cannot make the refundswithin the required time period. United argues that the Commission shouldprovide guidelines and procedures to obtain a waiver of the proposed refundtime limitations and late refund penalties when the first seller does nothave adequate resources or liquidity to make a lump sum payment. Finally,United requests that the Commission provide a means for purchasers to notifythe Commission that first sellers have not made timely refunds under andSection;270.101(e).The Commission agrees that additional time should be allowed for firstsellers to make refunds. The purpose of this rulemaking proceeding is toestablish specific time limits on which both the industry and the Commissioncan rely to accomplish prompt refunds and reports of refunds. However,the Commission also recognizes that first sellers may experience difficultiesin verifying and calculating refunds within the proposed 60-day time period.Accordingly, the Commission is revising proposed andSection; 270.101(e)(1)to provide that a first seller must make refunds within 120 days afternotice of a refund obligation.\1\\1\<NOTE/> This 120-day time period for the first sellers' refund obligationshould provide first sellers with sufficient time to calculate and makeaccurate refunds without the risk of penalty for untimely refunds.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ There is no change in the NOPR's proposal that thefirst sellers' refund reports must be filed 30 days after the date thatthe refund payment is due.The Commission will not adopt either Seller's proposal to establish proceduresfor extending the time periods in andSection; 270.101(e)(1) or United's proposalto establish procedures for purchasers to notify the Commission when thefirst sellers have not made timely refunds because our present regulationsalready address these concerns. First sellers can file for an adjustmentwhen longer periods of time are needed to make the refunds. On the otherhand, purchasers can file a complaint with the Commission when first sellershave not made timely refunds.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Section 271.805</ITAG>The NOPR proposed adding a new andSection; 271.805(g) that would requirefirst sellers to make refunds within 180 days after the last day of a 90-dayor 12-month stripper well disqualifying period, and to file refund reportswithin 210 days after that last day. El Paso requests that these time periodsrun instead from the time when a first seller becomes aware that a welldisqualifies. It claims that it at times experiences data adjustments toproduction history (metered volumes, number of days of production, andshut in days) to wells tied to its system, and that these data adjustmentscause time lags in identification and notification of stripper well disqualification.When these time lags occur, it argues, it could have difficulty, despiteits best efforts, meeting the proposed time requirements.The Commission does not see how additional time for making and reportingrefunds from stripper wells is warranted. Under the regulations adoptedhere, a first seller will have six months from the end of the disqualifyingperiod before refunds will be due.\1\\2\<NOTE/> The Commission believes this is an adequate period for dataadjustments and adequate time for first seller to verify these refunds.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 271.805(g) under which first sellers will have 180days after the last day of a disqualifying 90-day or 12-month period tomake refunds. These six months consist of 90 days to report the disqualification,60 days to decide whether to file a petition under andSection; 271.806, andan additional 30 days to make the refund.B. NotificationSeveral commenters were concerned with the proposed language of andSection;270.101(e)(1) that would require a first seller to make refunds ``afterthe seller is notified that refund is due or becomes aware that a refundis due''. Columbia notes that it is unclear how a purchaser will know whena first seller becomes aware that a refund is due, thus making it unclearwhen the purchaser must make the refund recovery through a billing adjustmentif the first seller fails to make the refund. ARCO suggests that the timeperiod should run from the time the first seller's refund liability isverified, instead of from the time when the first seller is notified thata refund is due or becomes aware that a refund is due. Columbia also requestsclarification that purchasers need not determine when the first sellerbecomes aware that a refund is due and argues that this can be accomplishedby (1) requiring the first seller to notify the purchaser of a disqualifiedwell, and (2) requiring the purchaser to obtain a refund through a billingadjustment only after the purchaser becomes aware that a refund is due.Upon consideration of these comments, the Commission is revising the languagein andSection; 270.101(e)(1) to specify that the first seller must make refundsafter the first seller is notified by Commission staff or the purchaserthat refunds are due. The Commission notes that first sellers and purchasersare required to monitor stripper well production and report disqualificationsto each other. In addition, a copy of any staff letter notifying a firstseller of a refund obligation will be sent to the purchaser. Thus, theCommission believes the purchaser will know when billing adjustments shouldbe used.C. Billing AdjustmentsThe Commission proposed in the NOPR that when a first seller fails to makea refund, purchasers may utilize a billing adjustment to recover refunds.The proposed regulations provide that the first seller and purchaser couldagree to completion of a billing adjustment within a reasonable periodnot to exceed 120 days. In the alternative, it is proposed that a purchaserbe allowed to make a billing adjustment unilaterally, without the agreementof the first seller. Before the purchaser makes a unilateral billing adjustment,however, the proposed regulations would require the purchaser to providethe first seller written notice of the refund amount and the time periodduring which the billing adjustment would be completed.Columbia argues that the Commission should not limit the time period forrecovery of an agreed-to billing adjustment to 120 days but instead allowfor a certain time period for the first seller and purchaser to negotiatea refund, not to exceed one year. United requests the Commission to establishprocedures to obtain a waiver of the 120-day time limit for billing adjustmentsto avoid undue harm to the first seller. Tennessee Gas recommends thatandSection; 270.101(e)(2) be clarified to establish that the 120-day timeperiod during which all agreed-to billing adjustments are to be concludedis to be calculated from the date the first seller is notified of the refundobligation or becomes aware that a refund obligation may be due. In responseto these concerns, the Commission is revising the regulations to substituteone year for the 120-day time period for an agreed-to billing adjustment,and to specify a starting date for the one-year term. The revised regulationsprovide instead that the purchaser can make a billing adjustment, eitherwith or without previous agreement by the seller, within a reasonable periodof time not to exceed one year from the date the first seller is notifiedof a refund obligation. As we noted earlier, first sellers may seek anadjustment based on the facts of a particular situation if more time isneeded.Commenters also raise a number of concerns about the unilateral billingadjustment procedures proposed in the NOPR. Exxon argues that a unilateralbilling adjustment by the purchaser should not be permitted until 30 daysafter the close of the first sellers' refund period. Sellers and ARCO arguethat purchasers should not have the right to recover the refund througha unilateral billing adjustment without the first seller's concurrenceas to amount and time allowed for recovery. Sellers also argue that theCommission should require the purchaser to pay interest on refund amountswrongly recouped by the purchaser through a billing adjustment. In thealternative, Sellers seek procedures that may be used to prevent a purchaserfrom unilaterally making a billing adjustment when the first seller hasa good faith belief that no refund is due or that the refund amount isin error.ARCO argues that the purchaser must provide, in addition to notice to thefirst seller that the purchaser is invoking the unilateral billing adjustment,sufficient documentation to support the basis on which the purchaser proposesto recoup the funds through the billing adjustment. On the other hand,El Paso requests that the Commission delete the provision in andSection;270.101(e)(3) requiring the purchaser to notify the first seller of theamount of the refund to be recovered and the time period during which thebilling adjustment will be completed. El Paso argues that this requirementwould be unduly burdensome, because of the large number of stripper wellsin which it is first purchaser, and duplicative, because the first selleralready is aware of a refund being due. It requests that the Commissionprovide instead for unilateral billing adjustments without prior notificationfrom the purchaser.These arguments regarding unilateral billing adjustments were initiallyraised and addressed in Order No. 423 when the Commission first establishedprocedures permitting purchasers to use billing adjustments to recoverinterim collection refunds under andSection; 273.302 of the Commission'sregulations. In addition to specifying time periods for refund collection,the final rule adopted here allows purchasers to use virtually the samebilling adjustment procedures established in Order No. 423 for all refundobligations other than interim collection refund obligations. The Commissioncontinues to believe that additional protection for first sellers againstincorrect billing adjustments is generally unnecessary. The purchasers'notice requirement in the billing adjustment procedures was establishedin Order No. 423 to guarantee that the rights of producers are protected.\1\\3\<NOTE/> The Commission has not seen any evidence that the billingadjustment procedures in the interim collection refund regulations arecreating any hardships for sellers or purchasers.\1\\4\<NOTE/> The Commission, therefore, concludes that it is unnecessaryto modify the unilateral billing adjustment procedures as they apply toall refund obligations in this final rule. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ As noted in Order No. 423, first sellers may avoidbilling adjustments by making lump-sum payments within the specified periodof time. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ Accordingly, the Commission believes it is not necessaryto amend andSection; 273.302(e)(1)(iii) as proposed by Exxon. Sellers contend further that a billing adjustment cannot be used if thecurrent purchaser of gas from a well is not the purchaser to whom the refundsare owed. The Commission notes, however, that Order No. 423 stated thata billing adjustment can be made on any other well in which the first sellerhas an interest that the purchaser is taking gas from. This policy shouldapply also to all refund obligations covered by this final rule. Finally, United is concerned about being required to refund to its customersthe amounts not yet collected from first sellers. The Commission clarifiesthat a purchaser is not obligated to make refunds to its customers untilit has the refunds from the first seller. D. First Seller's Refund Report In both andSection; 270.101(e)(4) and andSection; 271.805(g)(2) of the proposedregulations, the Commission would require the first seller to file a refundreport, accompanied by a purchaser's concurrence. Section 271.850(g)(2)would require in the alternative a statement, also accompanied by a purchaserconcurrence, that no refunds are due. First sellers would not need to filethese refund reports if an interstate pipeline purchaser recovers the refundthrough a billing adjustment. ARCO argues that the Commission should sever the purchaser's concurrencefrom the first seller's refund report and require the purchaser to submitthe concurrence independently. Sellers argue that the requirement to filea statement that no refunds are due should be eliminated from andSection;271.805(g)(2). In the alternative, Sellers argue that the Commission atleast should eliminate the purchaser's concurrence in andSection; 271.805(g)(2).Sellers also request that the Commission require the purchaser to providethe seller with a statement of concurrence or nonconcurrence within a specificperiod of time after receiving a refund. Finally, Sellers request thatthe Commission permit first sellers to file a statement that no concurrenceby the purchaser was received whenever the purchaser fails to provide theseller with a concurrence within the specific time limits that Sellersare seeking to have imposed for that purpose. In response to these concerns, the Commission clarifies that if the purchaserhas not submitted a concurrence before the time period to submit the refundreport passes, the first seller may file the refund report without thepurchaser's concurrence. In this event, the purchaser must then file theconcurrence separately with the Commission within 30 days of the firstseller's refund report. In order to monitor the payment of all required refunds, a refund reportor a statement that no refunds are due, together with a purchaser's concurrence,is necessary. However, in response to comments by Sellers that the requirementin andSection; 271.805(g)(2) for filing a purchaser's concurrence is burdensomebecause many sales are made in the spot market and the purchaser may notbe aware that some of the gas is subject to a maximum lawful price, theCommission is adding to andSection; 271.805(g)(2) a provision to permit thefirst seller to submit in lieu of a ``no refund due'' statement and a purchaser'sconcurrence, an affidavit stating that it did not collect more than theotherwise applicable MLP.E. Miscellaneous <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Purchasers Need Information From First Sellers on a Well-by-WellBasis </ITAG>Tennessee Gas argues that the Commission's objective of prompt enforcementof all refund obligations (whether under the interim collection refundregulation in andSection; 273.302 or the general refund regulations in andSection;270.101) cannot be achieved until the Commission (1) recognizes that thepurchaser must have well-by-well information available to it from the firstsellers in order to verify and enforce refund obligations and recover refundsthrough billing adjustments, and (2) imposes on all first sellers a continuingobligation to provide purchasers with detailed well information for eachwell drilled and completed or redrilled in the applicable contract area.In general, the NGPA established maximum lawful prices for natural gason a well-by-well basis. The Commission believes that Tennessee Gas, asa prudent purchaser, should require producers to submit such data as partof its own billing procedures to ensure that its payments comply with theNGPA price ceilings. The Commission, therefore, sees no need for a specificrequirement for individual well data in the refund regulations establishedin this final rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Responsibility for Refunding Excess Severance Taxes</ITAG>ANR andamp; CIG argue that the NOPR does not address the need to refund excessstate production and severance taxes remitted to the appropriate tax authorityby a pipeline purchaser on behalf of a first seller. They note that neitherandSection;andSection;270.101 or 271.805, as they exist or are proposed tobe revised, squarely addresses the issue of whether the first seller orthe purchaser is responsible for obtaining a refund of excess state taxeswhich have been remitted by the purchaser. ANR andamp; CIG, therefore, requestthe Commission to clarify that refunds will include any excess state severanceor production taxes remitted by purchasers on behalf of first sellers.NGPA section 110 and andSection;271.1102(a) of the Commission's regulationsprovide that the maximum lawful price may be exceeded only to the extentnecessary to recover state severance taxes borne by the first seller. Therefore,the Commission clarifies that if the purchaser paid excess severance orproduction taxes on behalf of a first seller, the first seller's refundobligation includes amounts attributable to the excess severance or productiontaxes.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Civil Penalty Remedies</ITAG>In the NOPR, the Commission noted tha most interstate pipelines have nottaken advantage of the billing adjustment provisions in Order No. 423 \1\\5\<NOTE/> as a remedy to first sellers' almost chronic delays in makingrefunds. The Commission advised interstate pipelines that corrective actionwill be pursued if the billing adjustment provisions continue to be ignored.Additionally, the Commission noted its authority under section 504(b)(6)of the NGPA to assess civil penalties for knowing violations of its regulations.The Commission noted that if the problem of delay in refunding persists,it will consider the civil penalty remedy on a case-by-case basis.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\50 FR 23,669 (June 5, 1989); FERC Stats. andamp; Regs.[Regulations Preambles 1982-1985] andpara; 30,645 (May 30, 1985).El Paso seeks confirmation from the Commission that it would be inequitableto assess a civil penalty against a purchaser when the Commission's regulationsassign first sellers the duty of calculating and returning amounts overcollectedin a first sale. The Commission does not agree with El Paso's position.The Commission emphasized in the NOPR that even though a first seller continuesto carry the primary responsibility for its refund obligation, purchasersalso have an obligation, as part of prudent management, to ensure thatthey recover and pass through refunds owed to their customers. The Commissionstressed that most interstate pipelines have contributed to the problemof delay by not using billing adjustments as a remedy to first sellers'almost chronic delays in making interim collection refunds. As a consequence,the Commission advised interstate pipelines that it intends to pursue correctiveaction if the billing adjustment provisions continue to be ignored. TheCommission, therefore, has made clear in both the NOPR and this final rulethat both first sellers and purchasers have an affirmative obligation toensure prompt refunds.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Statute of Limitations</ITAG>United argues that the imposition of time limits for refunds and the recoveryof refunds through billing adjustments has the effect of imposing a statuteof limitations on the pipeline's ability to collect these refunds. TheCommission points out that the 120-day time period in andSection;270.101(e)is only a deadline for the first seller to make a lump sum payment of therefund; it does not relieve the first seller of its refund obligation ifthe refund is not made within the 120-day period. Neither is the purchaserrelieved of the obligation to pursue the refund in any manner.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Effective Date of Refund Regulations</ITAG>Exxon argues that no refunds should be due under the final rule until 120days after its effective date or that the effective date should be 120days after the final rule is issued. According to Exxon, unless some typeof grandfathering is provided for, refunds could literally be due the daythe final rule is issued. The Commission believes that 120 days is toolong to wait before the final rule in this proceeding becomes effective,and that an effective date of 30 days after publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> is adequate. The deadlines imposed herein arereasonable, and purchasers and sellers have had extensive notice (throughthe NOPR) of the Commission's intent to adopt them.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Environmental Statement</ITAG>Commission regulations require that an environmental assessment or an environmentalimpact statement must be prepared for any Commission action that may havea significant adverse effect on the human environment.\1\\6\<NOTE/> The Commission has categorically excluded certain actionsfrom this requirement as not having a significant effect on the human environment.\1\\7\<NOTE/> No environmental consideration is necessary for the promulgationof a rule that is clarifying, corrective, or procedural or that does notsubstantially change the effect of legislation or regulations being amended.\1\\8\<NOTE/> This rule is procedural in nature and merely sets time framesfor existing refunds and reporting requirements. Consequently, since thisrule falls within the categorical exemptions provided in the Commission'sregulations, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmentalassessment is required.\1\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\Regulations Implementing National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969, 52 FR 47897 (Dec. 17, 1987), FERC Stats. andamp; Regs., andpara;30,783 (Dec. 10, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\18 CFR 380.4 (1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\18 CFR 380.4(a)(2)(ii) (1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\<T3>See </T3>CFR 380.4(a)(1) (1988).<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) generally requires a description andanalysis of final rules that will have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities.\2\\0\<NOTE/> The Commission is not required to make an RFA analysis ifit certifies that a proposed rule will not have a ``significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\5 U.S.C. 601-612 (1982).The final rule revises andSection;270.101(e) by setting a time limit of 120days for the seller to refund excess charges and a time limit of 30 daysafter the refund is due to report refunds to the Commission. Currently,overcharges must be refunded and reported promptly. Thus, this final rulesimply provides time frames for the refund and reporting requirements whichare already in place.The final rule also revises andSection;271.805(g) to specify that refundsdue to the disqualification of stripper wells are due within 180 days afterthe last day of the disqualifying 90-day or 12-month period. A refund reportor statement of no refund due for stripper wells is due within 210 daysafter the last day of the disqualifying 90-day or 12-month period. Thereports required by andSection;270.101(e)(4) and andSection;271.805(g)(2) willnot include any information regarding a refund recovered by an interstatepipeline purchaser through a billing adjustment.In view of these considerations, the Commission has determined, pursuantto section 605(a) of the RFA, that the filing dates for refunds and refundreports will not have ``a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.''<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII.
