Immigration and Naturalization Service officials said Wednesdaythat three of the requests were approved, but their names were notreleased.   Perry Rivkind, INS district director in Miami, said the claimswere given ``special action'' status and reviewed on the spot. INSofficials said the other six requests were being given top priority.   The applications came two days after five Central Americanpresidents signed an accord in Tela, Honduras, calling for thedismantling of the Contras within four months. Nicaraguan PresidentDaniel Ortega said the pact marks the death of the rebel movement.   But the rebel officers denied their asylum requests were linkedto the accord.   Israel Galeano, the rebel chief of staff known as ComandanteFranklin, told The Miami Herald the group sought asylum to obtaintravel documents and weren't planning to move to the United States.   ``Some of us have the need right now to mobilize in theinternational field,'' said Galeano. ``There is a need to getdocuments to travel.''   He promised to continue the fight with ``limitless humanresources'' and said he would return to Nicaragua if the Contrasare kicked out of Honduras.   A Contra political adviser who requested asylum said therequests could send a misleading signal to the estimated 12,000rebel troops languishing in border camps in Honduras.   ``It could be demoralizing to the troops if we were seen asretiring from the struggle,'' Francisco ``Johnny'' Delgadillo said.``But the troops know that's not so. Our struggle continues.''   Delgadillo also expressed anger over the Tela agreement.   ``We don't want to live like slaves to the signature of thepresidents,'' he said. ``We want to go on being rebels.''   Ortega's Sandinista government has agreed to democratic reformsleading to national elections in exchange for the repatriation orresettlement of the Contras by Dec. 8.   While the Bush administration lobbied to keep the Contras intactuntil Nicaragua's scheduled elections in February 1990, Washingtonofficials have reluctantly embraced the accord. Military aid to therebels was cut off by Congress in Febraury 1988.   A complete list of the nine commanders was not immediately madepublic, but others known to have to have requested asylum includedJose ``Emmanuel'' Aguilar, a southern commander; Fremio ``JimmyLeo'' Altamirano, a northern commander, and Luis Angel Lopez.</TEXT></DOC>
