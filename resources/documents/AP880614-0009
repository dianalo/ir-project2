Don Edwards,D-Calif., chairman of the civil and constitutional rightssubcommittee. ``I am thinking seriously of sometime early next yeartaking another quick look at this issue and writing the beginningsof an FBI charter.''   Edwards and other members of the panel appeared to agree withrecommendations from four witnesses that there should be onestandard, instead of the current two sets of guidelines, for FBIprobes of domestic terrorism and that this standard should bewritten into law instead of left to the attorney general todetermine.   One witness, Morton Halperin, director of the Washington officeof the American Civil Liberties Union, said he believes that ``allinvestigations of political organizations should be based onpublic, codified guidelines and should include frequent review toensure that they stay within the prescribed bounds.''   Halperin added, ``The ACLU believes that one publicly enunciatedstandard should apply for all criminal intelligenceinvestigations.''   Spurring Monday's hearings was the FBI's handling of aninvestigation into the Committee in Solidarity with the People ofEl Salvador, or CISPES.   The New York Times reported in Tuesday's editions thatgovernment officials said an internal FBI report has recommendeddisciplinary action against some bureau personnel, possiblyincluding field agents, involved in the CISPES investigation.   The officials said the report is the most critical to date fromsenior bureau officials and was sent last month to FBI directorWilliam Sessions from the bureau's Inspection Division. But theofficials told the newspaper Sessions has not made a decision onwhether to punish anyone for action in the CISPES operation.   FBI spokesman Milt Ahlerich would not comment on the contents ofthe division's report but said ``This agency has no hesitancy indisciplining its own people...''   According to FBI documents released in January and comments byFBI officials since then, that investigation began in September1981 as a probe into alleged criminal violations of domesticsecurity laws. Specifically, the FBI was looking into whetherCISPES was supplying money and material to leftist rebels in ElSalvador.   That investigation was closed the following February. But inMarch 1983, the FBI began a new investigation of CISPES under adifferent set of guidelines, those governing internationalterrorism. Although much of those guidelines are classified, it isknown that they give the FBI far more sweeping authority toinvestigate U.S. citizens.   Eric Richard, a former Justice Department aide, told thesubcommittee that ``it may not have been fully realized howfrequently the groups that would be the targets of such(international terrorism) investigations would be composedprimarily of American citizens.''   Richard and other witnesses agreed that although the FBI said itwas looking into whether CISPES was a front group for a core ofpeople who were aiding international terrorists, the bureau'sinvestigation ended up focusing on public CISPES meetings andstatements.   ``Widescale monitoring of public events served on apparentpurpose toward achieving the FBI's stated objective,'' Halperintestified. ``A front organization ... is not going to reveal itshidden agenda in its public activities.''   Halperin argued and John E. Finn, an assistant professor ofgovernment at Wesleyan University, disagreed that the FBI violatedthe First Amendment rights of CISPES members by using that tactic.   However, all four witnesses agreed that the FBI never would havebeen able to conduct its investigation that way had it beenrequired by law to look for criminal violations.   ``The domestic security guidelines require a criminal link,''Richard said, adding that that is not so with the internationalterrorism guidelines.   ``The domestic security ... guidelines have worked so well inbalancing civil liberties, intelligence and law enforcementconcerns that it may be time to spread the benefits of theseguidelines more widely,'' he said.   The witnesses also said that an FBI statute should require thatinvestigations of suspected terrorists in the United States bereviewed frequently by top FBI and Justice Department officials.   Kenneth C. Bass III, also a former Justice Department official,told the panel that he thought there was a need for frequentreviews because ``it it my experience these investigations oftencontinue a year or more after they should have ended.''</TEXT></DOC>
