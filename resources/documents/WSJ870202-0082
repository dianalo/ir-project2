Higgins</HL><DD> 02/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   CBS ran two sleepers back-to-back a week ago yesterday, the first being the soporific second half of the Broncos-Giants Super Bowl (dashing the hopes of viewers who've been quietly hoping for years to see a full four quarters of competitive ball), the second being the refreshing 90-minute pilot of &quot;Hard Copy,&quot; scheduled to begin its regular 60-minute Sunday format last night at 10.    &quot;Hard Copy's&quot; venue is the press room of some metropolitan police department. With one exception -- the formidably disagreeable Lt. Guyla Cook, played by Fionnula Flanagan -- the principal and secondary characters are reporters. Some perspective is necessary here.    We ink-stained wretches seldom applaud fictional interpretations of real-life reporters. We have excellent reasons, the most recent springing to mind like the undigested remains of an anchovy pizza at four in the morning: ABC's &quot;Jack and Mike&quot; Or is it &quot;Mike and Jack&quot;? I forget. It's &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; without Freeway and Max, &quot;Moonlighting&quot; without the wit, &quot;Mr. and Mrs. North&quot; without the plot, and &quot;Tombstone Territory&quot; without the craggy hokum from The Epitaph's editor, Hollis Claiborne (Richard Eastham).    She is a columnist for a Chicago newspaper. What he does is not that clear, except that he seems to make enough money at it to enable him to play poker for $2,000 pots with his pals. In other words, it's bunk, and we've seen so many such exercises that we reflexively react. And we're usually right.    This perhaps explains why CBS more or less smuggled &quot;Hard Copy&quot; into public view under cover of darkness: to avoid advance pollution of it in the public's mind. Shrewd move, if it was planned; lucky one if it just happened. &quot;Hard Copy,&quot; judged solely on the basis of its maiden flight, is a promising entry for television's second season, and merits the kind of forbearance that &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; enjoyed as its principals --producing and performing -- spent their first half-season six years ago taking two steps forward and one step back in their progress toward a weekly show of uniform high quality.    Daniel Pyne, the supervising producer also listed as one of three creators and script writers, has fashioned for Michael Murphy, Dean Devlin and Wendy Crewson characters not only initially interesting but three-dimensional enough to warrant confidence that they will develop. Ms. Crewson's Blake is a savvy police reporter marginally hindered in her work by a tendency toward over-much reflection on the morality of euchring fat quotes out of people bereaved by crime. Mr. Murphy's Andy is a burnt-out case whose self-pity interferes not at all with his strict adherence to the code of double-crossing SOBs. Mr. Devlin plays the beardless youth, David, as an impressive crossbreed of Sammy Glick and Oliver Twist, part smooth-faced crocodile and part calculating puppy. Loafing, malingering and poaching around them eddies a pool of castoffs, blowhards and scoundrels redeemed only by comparison with their shared enemy, the dim-witted TV news hairdo who competes with print reporters, bungles the facts and prevails. There's plenty of room in this collection of rowdies for skillful screen writers to enlarge upon the ambivalence of personalities whose professional prosperity depends upon the simultaneous authenticity of their empathy with victims, and the reality of their total willingness to violate the privacy they thus penetrate. Played correctly, that contradiction should mirror nicely the physical jeopardy that makes police work and its coverage a dependable source of anguish for practitioners.    It isn't perfect yet. The premiere faltered somewhat in its first third or so. Director Rick Rosenthal and the writers appeared to be setting up the tension to come by verging on vaudeville. Another in a series of freeway assassinations has just taken place; Lt. Cook, with all the winning personality of a manta ray, proposes to evict our happy-go-lucky scribblers from their slovenly lair; the house fat guy and sloth masterminds an in-house barbecue in which all hands fall to with beer and boogie.    Comes the dawn and one of the celebrants falls victim to the shooter, thus imposing sobriety upon those of her colleagues who have not yet slept off the booze.    Things steadied down after that, though, with Andy and David hogging their story from their office mates and from each other, and Blake cadging what morsels she could from both them and the police. The killer turned out to be a man deranged by the drunk-driving death of his only son, seeking cordite revenge on any and all who happened to be in the bar the night the kid got fatally plastered. His pursuit provided ample opportunity for Andy to toy with defection to public relations (and to entertain thoughts of private relations with a blonde) and to disillusion young David not just once but thrice. Blake admitted fetchingly to Andy that she could do with a bit of slap-and-tickle herself, so the interstices between the potshots were nicely fleshed out with good dirty fun.    Remarkably, Mr. Pyne and his cohort for the debut eschewed the pastiche narrative approach that Stephen Bochco and Michael Kozoll established in &quot;Hill Street&quot; as the current fashion for adult dramatic series (e.g., &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;; &quot;L.A. Law&quot;). &quot;Hard Copy's&quot; approach was linear, a story in the traditional form with beginning, middle and end, not the ostensibly random grouping of often unrelated events that distinguishes the &quot;Hill Street&quot; format. This is not to say that one approach is automatically more rewarding than the other for the viewer, only that such relatively recent dogs as &quot;The Equalizer&quot; and &quot;Remington Steele,&quot; on the heels of &quot;Matt Houston&quot; and, yes, &quot;Hart to Hart,&quot; rendered the linear approach somewhat suspect, and Mr. Pyne showed some courage in choosing it.    More of that courage and a sure sense of timing and proportion seem to be all that will be needed for &quot;Hard Copy&quot; to mature into a reliable weekly event. There are not enough of them on network television; it's agreeable when a new one surfaces. </TEXT></DOC>
