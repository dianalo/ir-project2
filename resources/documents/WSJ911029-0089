We haven't dared blow the whistle onthat kind of person until recently, and it's high time weblew.</LP><TEXT>   I lined up firmly with Anita Hill because if what she saidis true -- and I think it was -- a man who will be decidingcases in the highest court affecting the lives of millions ofwomen shouldn't be handling his own sexual needs thatparticular way. I went on to tell the newspaper, however,that I believe implied or even stated sexual interest betweenmen and women in an office, if it doesn't fall in thecategory of tasteless or unwanted, is not a bad thing.   Some of the best creative work ever to come out of officesI've worked in (17 before I got to Cosmo) has been producedby teams of men and women showing off for each other, gettingthe best from each other's brains, enjoying each others'company as well as their work. There is synergy -- is thatthe word? -- there's . . . electricity . . . excitement . . .lucky management] Mostly the sexual tension doesn't leadanywhere. If it does . . . an affair ensues . . . theparticipants are smart enough to keep it hushed up. Nobodywants to work around two people in love . . . yuccck] Manyoffice affairs have led to marriage, of course; the ones thathaven't have frequently at least provided pleasure withouthurting the Pandamp;L.   Many people have suggested articles on sexual harassmentto Cosmo. Though a devout feminist, I have resisted. I havethis possibly benighted idea that when a man finds yousexually attractive, he is paying you a compliment . . . whenhe doesn't, that's when you have to worry. Second, mostunwanted sexual advances can and are turned away without direresults, notwithstanding more serious cases mentionedearlier. Last, I feel men and women are in the best shape wehave ever been in with each other and I don't want to stressnegatives.   I recently wrote in Esquire: &quot;I don't think there's anyconfusion about what women expect of men these days. Womenwant what men want -- to be treated equitably, to becherished, respected, adored, and encouraged in their work.If the so called confusion nowadays is because women haveescaped their traditional role of just helping men andchildren to get what they want, and are out for themselves(in terms of careers), it is a small price for a man to payfor an equal mate. Equal mates are lots more fun than unequalones. It seems to me men are very nicely getting the hang ofhow terrific it is to have a woman use her brains forprofessional achievement just as men do. At the same time, wewomen haven't lost our desire for men. I think we're doingjust fine]&quot;   I know about sexual harassment. When I was working my waythrough secretarial school in Los Angeles at radio stationKHJ, and I came in from school every afternoon, some of themen would be playing a dandy game called &quot;Scuttle.&quot; Rules:All announcers and engineers who weren't busy would select asecretary, chase her down the halls, through the musiclibrary and back to the announcing booths, catch her and takeher panties off. Once the panties were off, the girl couldput them back on again. Nothing wicked ever happened.Depantying was the sole object of the game.   While all this was going on, the girl herself usuallyshrieked, screamed, flailed, blushed, threatened andpretended to faint, but to my knowledge no scuttler was everreported to the front office. Au contraire, the girls woretheir prettiest panties to work.   There was some retaliatory action one afternoon. Foursecretaries ambushed the head scuttler while he wasannouncing &quot;Captain Midnight&quot; on a 42-station hook-up andtook his pants off.   Alas, I was never scuttled. Sometimes I would look uphopefully from my typewriter to see three or four scuttlersskulking in the doorway mulling it over, but the decision wasalways the same -- too young, too pale, too flat-chested.Clearly unscuttlable.   I think indeed we should come down hard on the bullies andthe creeps but not go stamping out sexual chemistry at work.   ---   Ms. Brown is editor in chief of Cosmopolitan magazine.</TEXT></DOC>
