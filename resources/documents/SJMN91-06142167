An additional 370 hospitalsare still designated as trauma centers, but many are under severe financialstrain and may not survive for long, it said.;    The study was requested bySen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate subcommittee on health forfamilies and the uninsured. He said it shows a need for &quot;comprehensive reform&quot;of the health care system.;    &quot;Trauma centers can't stay open when theirlosses mean a financial choke hold on the hospitals that run them,&quot; Rieglesaid.;    The GAO reviewed 35 trauma centers in Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles,Miami, San Diego and Washington. Of those, 15 have closed within the last fiveyears -- 12 because of financial hardship.;    Most of the centers stilloperating are losing money.;    The high cost of treating trauma patients,many of whom have no health insurance, and limited assistance from Medicaidand other government programs are the biggest reasons for the crisis, the GAOsaid. Inner-city hospitals have a disproportionately high share of uninsuredtrauma patients.;    In 1988 dollars, the average charge per admission in atrauma center was about $12,000, compared with $4,130 per admission in ahospital for regular acute care.;    The trauma system developed from thewartime experiences of military doctors. During World War II and subsequentconflicts, they discovered that speedy treatment and availability of skilledsurgical teams were keys to saving lives of badly injured soldiers, the GAOreport said.;    The system has reduced trauma deaths rates by up to 64percent in some civilian hospitals.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910521  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  339  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday May 21, 199100142167,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
