The Pittsburgh-based glass, coatings and chemicals concern replaced its holder rights plan -- adopted in 1985 -- with an updated one. It said the change wasn't sparked by a known purchase threat.    First-quarter net jumped to $118.6 million, or $1.07 a share, as sales rose 8.9% to $1.37 billion.    Glass operations reported a 37% rise in operating profit, to $114 million, on a 9.5% increase in revenue, to $598 million. They benefited from gains in European automotive and construction markets, and from demand for fiber glass products.    Operating profit from chemicals rose 79% to $61 million; revenue rose 15% to $261 million despite the sale of businesses with $37 million of sales a year earlier.    Operating profit from coatings and resins fell 4.6% to $62 million; PPG cited lower U.S. auto output and higher support costs. Sales rose 4.5% to $465 million. </TEXT></DOC>
