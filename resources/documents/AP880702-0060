(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Television evangelist Pat Robertson, aspeaker at today's state Republican convention, said he plans tocampaign for Vice President George Bush in states where Robertsonhad a stronger showing.   Robertson also said he thinks the best vice presidential runningmate for Bush is Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan.   Robertson said in a telephone interview Friday that Bush askedhim for help in bringing Robertson supporters into the GOP fold.Robertson easily carried the state's March 8 precinct caucuses andcontrols about 70 percent of the delegates at the Washington stateGOP convention.   ``The vice president wants me to be active in states where hedidn't do as well as I did,'' Robertson said. ``That would includeWashington, Nevada, Minnesota and Iowa. And I'll be going into theSouth as a surrogate to bring the rather substantial movement thatwas supporting me to the elections for the vice president.''   Robertson predicted a close election and said his followerscould make the difference in a GOP victory.   Robertson said Dole's presence on the ticket would help.   ``I don't presume to tell George Bush what to do but I think thestrongest candidate we have for vice president is Bob Dole,''Robertson said. ``He brings strength in the Midwest and Mountainstates to go along with Bush's strength in the East and the South.   ``Plus, Dole's legislative experience along with George Bush'sforeign policy experience would make a nice balance and make for avery strong ticket,'' he said.   Dole, who spoke to the convention banquet Friday evening, saidhe would be willing to discuss the vice presidency.   ``I'm not campaigning for it. I'm not seeking it,'' Dole said,but added if Bush called him, ``I'd say very honestly I'd be happyto discuss it.''   The Robertson-dominated convention is expected to adopt anultra-conservative platform, including support for South Africa'sposition on apartheid.   The platform reads like a compendium of conservative thought. Itis against gay rights, a state income tax, abortion, the UnitedNations, and school health clinics, and for the deploymentStrategic Defense Initiative of space-based weapons, Contra aid``everywhere,'' prayer in the schools and more nuclear development.   The state convention is poised to send the nation's largestRobertson delegation, apparently 38 delegates, to the national GOPconvention in New Orleans next month.</TEXT></DOC>
