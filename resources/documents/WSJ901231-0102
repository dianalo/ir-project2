The federal government spends roughly that amount annuallyon contracts with small businesses for everything fromtoothpaste and guard services to missile parts andgroundskeeping. If you know what you are doing, governmentwork can be a steady and profitable source of business.</LP><TEXT>   But for the uninitiated, trying to win and completegovernment contracts &quot;can really be a madhouse&quot; that drainsresources from a small company, says Frank Lopez, owner ofArion Computer Inc., a Houston computer supplier hoping tosnag its first federal contract.   That's where people such as Mr. Wilder come in. Asexecutive director of Houston-based Texas InformationProcurement Service, Mr. Wilder and his staff help smallbusinesses -- for a fee of $200 per year -- find governmentwork and navigate around sometimes encyclopedic biddingrequirements, arcane rules and flinty-eyed governmentauditors.   Since opening in 1986, TIPS, as the Texas operation isknown, has helped some 3,000 businesses obtain over $200million in contracts, says Mr. Wilder. &quot;Of those companies,90% had never done business with the government before,&quot; headds.   Mr. Wilder's operation is one of 90 relatively littleknown procurement-assistance centers operating in 43 states.Partly financed by $9 million a year from the DefenseDepartment and usually operated by local universities orstate agencies, these centers are in the front lines of aneffort to bring more small businesses into thegovernment-contracting arena, as a way of increasingcompetition and lowering costs.   In the current economic downturn, the importance of suchcenters is growing, observers say. A diet of government work&quot;can be the difference between surviving and getting burnedup&quot; in a recession, says Jon Goodman, director of theentrepreneur program at the University of Southern Californiaand a founder of TIPS.   TIPS, which is part of the University of Houston, islauded by federal officials and other center directors as oneof the better such operations going. Much of the credit isgiven to the 45-year-old Mr. Wilder, who spent 21 years inprocurement activities for the U.S. Army before starting upthe center in 1986. &quot;Ed is Mr. Procurement,&quot; says PhyllisGolden Nelson, president of the Texas Association ofProcurement Centers, a trade group.   &quot;If it weren't for Wilder, my firm would probably be outof business,&quot; says Ed Pita, president of Process TechnologyInternational Inc., a Houston engineering and fabricationcompany. A supplier to the oil industry, Process Technologyhad disdained government work until the oil bust of themid-1980s sent Mr. Pita scrambling to find new business.   With TIPS help, the company has won more than $1.5 millionin contracts, representing about 40% of its revenue, over thepast three years. One crucial bit of early aid, says Mr.Pita, was showing the company how it could apply for and getprogress payments on its job of refurbishing some contractsfor the Army. &quot;Without that cash flow, I couldn't have donethe job,&quot; says Mr. Pita.   Government contracting isn't for every small business,says Mr. Wilder. A relatively new company, particularly, mayhave a hard time persuading a government contracting officerthat it has the technical or financial wherewithal tocomplete a contract, he says. Nonetheless, Mr. Wilder adds,his experience in Texas convinces him that only a tinypercentage of qualified small businesses actually go aftergovernment work.   TIPS goes through the Commerce Business Daily, aDepartment of Commerce publication that lists federalcontracts worth more than $25,000, looking for jobs to matchup with its clients. Sometimes Mr. Wilder goes through thelocal yellow pages looking for a company to match up with acontract he has found -- such as the $90,000 job he onceplaced with a local concern to rent trailers to the SecretService for surveillance work.   The procurement service is also plugged into the&quot;grandmothers' network&quot; that each year collects data onhundreds of thousands of contracts of less than $25,000.These smaller contracts only get posted on &quot;bid boards&quot; atthe local government facility that is in need of the service.Local people, often retirees, who live near the facility copydown the bid-board information and sell it to interestedparties, such as TIPS.   Finding the right contract is one thing, deciphering it isanother. A government bid solicitation can run severalhundred pages, spelling out the requirements in excruciatingdetail.   And details can be crucial. Arion Computer's Mr. Lopezsays he was about to make a bid on supplying 30 computerterminals to the government, until TIPS counselors discoveredthat the computers he had in mind lacked one small, butcrucial specification. &quot;If I had bid and won that contract, Iwould have been stuck with 30 computers at $4,500 each,&quot; hesays.   Once a company has been declared low bidder for acontract, it must often endure a &quot;pre-award survey&quot; by agovernment contracting officer checking to make sure thecompany can actually do the work. TIPS counselors do whatamount to dress rehearsals of these surveys and then act asobservers during the actual visits. &quot;We want to make sure ourclients don't get jerked around,&quot; says Mr. Wilder.   Jack Reid, president of International Polymer Corp. inHouston, says a TIPS review led him to rewrite his company'squality-assurance manual, which was crucial in passing anArmy survey for an ammunition contract. &quot;While we werecompetent to do the job, the contracting officer wouldn'thave known it without the revisions,&quot; he says.   Barbara Lasris, president and owner of Air RepairProducts, says her four-person concern used to supply itsair-purifying products to companies working for thegovernment. Sometimes they didn't pay her. &quot;TIPS showed mehow to bid directly and cut out the middlemen,&quot; she says.   TIPS also helped steer her through the esoterica ofgovernment procurement. Once, she was about to ship herdevices four to a box when Mr. Wilder noticed a code on theorder form stipulated a limit of one per box. &quot;That saved mefrom possibly having it sent back for improper shipping,&quot; shesays.</TEXT></DOC>
