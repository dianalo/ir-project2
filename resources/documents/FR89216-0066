(As set by 42 CFR 124.505(b),the effective date of these guidelines for facilities obligated under theHill-Burton Uncompensated Services Program is 60 days from the date ofthis publication.)For information about the number of persons in poverty or about the CensusBureau (statistical) poverty thresholds, contact Enrique Lamas, Chief,Poverty and Wealth Statistics Branch, U.S. Bureau of the Census (telephone:(301) 763-8578).This notice provides the 1989 update of the poverty income guidelines requiredby sections 652 and 673(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of1981 (Pub. L. 97-35). As required by that law, this update reflects lastyear's change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U); it was done using thesame procedure used in previous years.These poverty income guidelines are used as an eligibility criterion bya number of Federal programs. The guidelines are a simplified version ofthe Federal government's statistical poverty thresholds used by the Bureauof the Census to prepare its statistical estimates of the number of personsand families in poverty. The <T3>poverty income guidelines </T3>issued by the Department of Health andHuman Services (formerly by the Community Services Administration) areused for <T3>administrative</T3> purposes_for instance, for determining whethera person or family is financially eligible for assistance or services undera particular Federal program. The <T3>poverty thresholds</T3> are used primarily for <T3>statistical</T3> purposes.In certain cases, as noted in the relevant authorizing legislation or programregulations, a program uses the poverty income guidelines as only one ofseveral eligibility criteria, or uses a percentage multiple of the guidelines(for example, 130 percent or 185 percent of the guidelines). Some otherprograms, while not using the guidelines as a criterion of individual eligibility,use them for the purpose of giving priority to lower-income persons orfamilies in the provision of assistance or services. In some cases, thesepoverty income guidelines may not become effective for a particular programuntil a regulation or notice specifically applying to the program in questionhas been issued.The poverty guidelines given below should be used for both farm and nonfarmfamilies.The following definitions (derived for the most part from language usedin U.S. Bureau of the Census, Current Population Reports, Series P-60,No. 160 and earlier reports in the same series) are made available foruse in connection with the poverty income guidelines. Programs may usesomewhat different definitions.(a) <T3>Family.</T3> A family is a group of two or more persons related bybirth, marriage, or adoption who live together; all such related personsare considered as members of one family. For instance, if an older marriedcouple, their daughter and her husband and two children, and the oldercouple's nephew all lived in the same house, they would all be consideredmembers of a single family. If a household includes more than one familyand/or more than one unrelated individual, the poverty guidelines are appliedseparately to each family and/or unrelated individual, and not to the householdas a whole.(b) <T3>Family unit of size one.</T3> In connection with the poverty incomeguidelines, a family unit of size one is an unrelated individual (as definedby the Census Bureau)_that is, a person 15 years old or over (other thanan inmate of an institution) who is not living with any relatives. An unrelatedindividual may be the only person living in a housing unit, or may be livingin a housing unit (or in group quarters such as a rooming house) in whichone or more persons also live who are not related to the individual inquestion by birth, marriage, or adoption. (Examples of unrelated individualsresiding with others include a lodger, a foster child, a ward, or an employee.)(c) <T3>Income.</T3> This means total annual cash receipts before taxes fromall sources, with the exceptions noted below. Income data for a part ofa year may be annualized in order to determine eligibility_for instance,by multiplying by four the amount of income received during the most recentthree months. Income includes money wages and salaries before any deductions;net receipts from nonfarm self-employment (receipts from a person's ownunincorporated business, professional enterprise, or partnership, afterdeductions for business expenses); net receipts from farm self-employment(receipts from a farm which one operates as an owner, renter, or sharecropper,after deductions for farm operating expenses); regular payments from socialsecurity, railroad retirement, unemployment compensation, strike benefitsfrom union funds, workers' compensation, veterans' payments, public assistance(including Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Supplemental SecurityIncome, Emergency Assistance money payments, and non-Federally-funded GeneralAssistance or General Relief money payments), and training stipends; alimony,child support, and military family allotments or other regular supportfrom an absent family member or someone not living in the household; privatepensions, government employee pensions (including military retirement pay),and regular insurance or annuity payments; college or university scholarships,grants, fellowships, and assistantships; and dividends, interest, net rentalincome, net royalties, periodic receipts from estates or trusts, and netgambling or lottery winnings.As defined here, income does <T3>not</T3> include the following types of money received: capital gains;any assets drawn down as withdrawals from a bank, the sale of property,a house, or a car; tax refunds, gifts, loans, lump-sum inheritances, one-timeinsurance payments, or compensation for injury.
