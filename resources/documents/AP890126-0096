Both sides gathered at a hall this morning in the City, London'sfinancial district, for a second joint session. A first _ andunsuccessful _ meeting took place last April.   The secretary-general of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries, Subroto, told reporters Wednesday that the two sides``will exchange information'' today and plan to issue a jointstatement afterward.   The non-OPEC group issued a communique Wednesday saying: ``The(non-OPEC) delegates unanimously share the desire to see the oilmarket stabilize, an issue they consider of importance to bothconsumers and producers of oil.''   A senior OPEC source said he was hopeful an agreement could bereached for independent producers to cut their production, althoughhe said that wasn't likely soon.   ``Our unity is stronger now. Prices have strengthened and we areready'' for a cooperative agreement, said the OPEC source, whorequested anonymity.   ``This is the first step in a step-by-step move'' to push up oilprices, the source added.   In April, six non-OPEC producers met with representatives fromsix of OPEC's 13 members and suggested they jointly cut theirexports by 5 percent. OPEC, then more divided, rejected thatproposal.   This time, some of the seven attending non-OPEC producers mightoffer to cut their collective production by 5 percent, withoutasking for reciprocal cuts from OPEC, non-OPEC sources said thisweek.   They likely would want reassurances from OPEC that in that event,the cartel would not increase its own production.   The spot price of North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely tradedinternational crude oil, was $16.76 a barrel in afternoon tradingtoday, up 16 cents from late Wednesday. West Texas Intermediate, theU.S. benchmark crude oil, rose 25 cents to $18.37 a barrel today inlate-morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   The non-OPEC communique said representatives of Angola, China,Colombia, Egypt, Malaysia, Mexico, and Oman met with observers fromthe Soviet Union, Norway, the Yemen Arab Republic and the Canadianprovince of Alberta and the states of Alaska and Texas.   OPEC participants feel that if all goes well this week, the nextstep would be to call a meeting of the ministers of the six membersof the OPEC contact group with ministers from the participatingnon-OPEC countries, the source said.   That is likely to take place in late March to coincide with anOPEC committee meeting scheduled for March 29 in Vienna, the sourcesaid.   Holding such a meeting might be useful to help support oil pricesduring the second quarter, when demand traditionally slackens andprices weaken.   OPEC members agreed in November to limit their production to 18.5million barrels a day in an effort to boost prices to a targeted $18a barrel. The agreement was effective Jan. 1.   OPEC members are producing an estimated 19.5 million barrels aday, down as much as 3.5 million barrels a day from the fourthquarter. That has helped oil prices recover from about $12 a barrelin December.   In their previous accord, OPEC members agreed to limit productionto 15.06 million barrels a day.   The next full OPEC ministerial meeting is scheduled for June.   The other OPEC members are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar, Iran,Iraq and the United Arab Emirates.</TEXT></DOC>
