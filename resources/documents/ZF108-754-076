 Few dealt with general business problems.andM;Today, says Kipp Friedli, a product executive at Andersen Consulting inChicago, &quot;artificial intelligence applications are beginning to find theirway more and more into commercial applications.&quot;andM;This is not to suggest medical and scientific expert systems will disappear.andO;But the technology -- currently the most promising branch of artificialintelligence (AI) work -- is extending its reach into every corner ofbusiness and industry as well.andM;One indication is that the Canadian Information Processing Society (CIPS)recently formed a special interest group on knowledged-based systems.andO;(Several terms are commonly used to refer to systems which mimic humandecision-making processes.andP;  Most often called expert systems, they are alsoincreasingly referred to as knowledge-based or inference-based systems.)andM;What some called AI Winter -- the period during which vendors ofknowledge-based tools struggled to have their products accepted -- seems tobe over.andP;  Interest is strong in &quot;developing real solutions to businessproblems,&quot; says Gordon Graham, marketing manager for AI at Digital Equipmentof Canada Ltd. in Toronto.andM;&quot;We are seeing a very fundamental shift in the software needs of business,&quot;says Harry Reinstein, co-founder and chief executive officer of Aion Corp., aPalo Alto, Calif.andP;  vendor of expert systems tools.andP;  Instead of automatingback-office functions such as payrool, businesses now want to use thetechnology to deal with strategic issues.andM;&quot;In every organization,&quot; says Robert Goldman, president of AI Corp. ofWaltham, Mass., &quot;there is another class of problems that are more qualitativethan quantitative.&quot;andM;Expert systems Strategies, a newsletter published by Cutter Information Corp.andO;of Arlington, Va., said at the beginning of this year that the expert systemsmarket &quot;enters 1990 in the best shape it's been in during the last threeyears.&quot;andM;There are now several hundred strategic expert systems and thousands ofsmall- to midsized systems in real-world use, the newsletter said.andP;  &quot;Thecompanies that buy and use expert systems products have been steadily growingmore confident during the last three years.andP;  They have purchased expertsystems products; they have built a few systems; they have found that thetechnology works.&quot;andM;Experft system research has produced two kinds of commercial products.andP;  Somevendors have built expert systems which they sell as finished products.andO;Others are selling the tools with which their customers can create their ownknowledge-based applications.andM;Andersen Consulting is in the first category.andP;  The company sells MAC-PAC,software which helps manufacturers enter features and options for customerorders.andP;  The system lets a manufacturer define rules to cover pricing,inventory and what options are available with what orders.andM;Digital Equipment Corp. has also embedded expert systems in commercialproducts, including knowledge-based computer performance analysis in some ofits systems management software, and Rdb Expert, a tool to help designdatabases with DEC's Rdb relational database manager.andM;KnowledgePoint, of Petaluma, Calif., sells a PC sofftware package calledPersonnel Policy Expert that uses expert systems techniques to help developcorporate personnel policies.andP;  Users say they find it helpful, but don'treally think about the AI involved.andP;  &quot;I'd think of it more as anothercomputer application,&quot; says Sandy Shand, employee relations manager at theCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto and a Personnel Policy Expertuser.andM;The other part of the expert systems business lies in selling general expertsystems development tools.andP;  According to Expert Systems Strategies, the keyvendors in this area are AI Corp. and Aion.andM;IBM underscored the importance of this market in January by launching its ownentry.andP;  The Integrated Reasoning Shell (TIRS), will run on the company'smainframes and on PCs equipped with the OS/2 operating system.andM;It may be an indicator of the growing seriousness of expert systems thattools designed for more powerful computers are taking an increasing piece ofthe market.andP;  Sales of PC-based tools have been mainly to educationalinstitutions and those who simply wanted to experiment with the technology,Expert Systems Strategies reports.andM;Aion's Reinstein believes expert systems tools are becoming part ofmainstream computing.andM;Not only are companies using expert system tools to build expert systems,Reinstein told a seminar in Toronto recently, they are using them asprototyping tools and for developing traditional computer applications.andM;In fact, Reinstein says, building true expert systems comes low on mostusers' lists of ways they are using expert systems tools.andP;  It comes afterprototyping, extending existing applications, and actually building newapplications that are traditional rather than knowledge-based systems.andM;Expert systems tools allow rapid development of almost any type ofapplication, not just those we traditionally think of as expert systems,Reinstein argues.andP;  &quot;They're building in weeks what had taken months, or inmonths what had taken years.&quot;andM;Toronto-based Sears Canada has used AI Corp.'s KBMS software to develop aknowledge-based component for its nationwide distribution system.andP;  The expertsystem part deals with inventory allocation decisions, but it is mixed inwith more traditional elements, says Joe Colangelo, systems manager at Sears.andO;&quot;If it's really to be used in production it has to be used as part of anoverall traditional application,&quot; Colangelo says.andM;Terry Wood, manager of expert systems at London Life Insurance Co. in London,Ont., says his company has developed a variety of knowledge-based systemsusing several expert systems tools.andP;  Expert systems in the purest sense areonly part of the technology's potential, he says.andP;  &quot;I also see wideapplication of the knowledge-based technology to less complicated problems.&quot;andM;For instance, London Life has developed a number of knowledge-basedadministrative applications.andP;  &quot;They're there to help our administrative staffdo things more effectively,&quot; Wood says.andM;Similarly, Canada Safeway Ltd. in Vancouver sees a number of possible usesfor knowledge-based tools.andP;  Walter Klatt, information systems manager, saysone key application prompted Safeway's purchase of an expert-system tool.andO;That project is strategically important enough that he will not discuss it.andO;But he says the company will probably apply expert systems to a number ofmore routine problems, such as staff scheduling.andM;Wood notes that almost anything a company can develop with knowledge-basedtools could in theory be done with traditional programming languages.andP;  Thedifference is that the AI tools are better suited to developing certainapplications quickly, he says.andM;The remaining obstacle, Friedli says, is the need to educate data processingprofessionals about the potential of expert systems.andP;  &quot;Once these guysunderstand how to use it and aren't afraid of it we'll see a greaterproliferation of artificial intelligence applications.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
