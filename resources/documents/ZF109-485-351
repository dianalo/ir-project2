(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>OCR (optical character recognition) has removed a considerable amount of thedrudgery from translating printed material into electronic documents.andP;  MostMac OCR software has been best suited for low-volume situations orindividuals.andM;Now two new products from Calera Recognition Systems and Caere combinehardware and software to bring increased power, speed, and sophistication tohigh-volume OCR users.andP;  Calera's CDP 9000/ TopScan package and Cacre'sParallel Reader (both examined briefly in the July '90 issue, page 124) nowvie for this lucrative market.andM;CDP9000/TopScan.andP;  Not for the weak-walleted (the configuration I looked atlists for $31,950), Calera's top-of-the-line entry in the Mac OCR marketconsists of the CDP 9000 (the &quot;less expensive&quot; CDP6000 lists for a mere$19,950), a large scanner unit that you connect to your Mac with a SCSIcable, and TopScan software that you install on your hard disk.andP;  The systemrequires at least I megabyte of RAM, 2 megabytes if you plan to useMultiFinder.andP;  Setting up the hardware and software takes less than 30minutes, and all the necessary cables are shipped with the hardware.andP;  The CDPunit is not internally terminated, but Calera includes a SCSI terminator.andM;Once you've plugged everything in and turned it on, OCR scanning is a snap.andO;Place up to 50 pages in the bin at the top of the CDP unit, and then launchthe TopScan software  which works only with the CDP hardware).andP;  Select yoursettings and click on OK, and the pages are pulled through the scanner andfall into a drop tray attached to the front of the device.andP;  Recognitionprocessing takes place within the scanner, not on your Mac, and the wholeprocess is blazingly fast and highly accurate.andM;All tests conducted for this review were performed on a Mac IIcx equippedwith 5 megabytes of RAM.andP;  The documents used to obtain the speed and accuracycounts shown in Figures I and 2 were also scanned with OmniPage 2.1 on an HPScanJet Plus for comparison.andM;The CDP 9000 bested the Parallel Reader in every test.andP;  For example, thecomplex-letter test was a 500-word letter with multiple point-size and stylechanges.andP;  The CDP scanned and processed it in 49 seconds, correctlyrecognizing 90 percent of the text and character formatting.andP;  The Caereproduct lagged along at 2.5 minutes and captured only 82 percent of the textand formatting features.andP;  The outcome was much the same when it came to a faxdocument of similar size.andP;  The CDP was more than three times as fast as theParallel Reader when dealing with dot-matrix material, and it did a farbetter job of retaining tabs and spacing in the highly formatted programmingcode used for the dot-matrix test.andP;  The CDP also sped through a dense 20-pageportion of a thesis about 30 percent faster than the Parallel Reader  5.5versus 7.8 minutes).andM;The TopScan program boasts a sleek implementation of the Mac interface thatsports several advantages over what OmniPage users are familiar with.andO;TopScan lets you produce nearly fully formatted documents in ten common Macfile types, including MacWrite 5.0, MacWrite 11, Word 3.0 and 4.0,WordPerfect, Write Now, and even Excel.andP;  You can specify the typeface a filewill be saved in and create style sheets of your settings for future use.andO;You can also scan and save text and graphics simultaneously by selectingzones or areas of the page in a preview mode and specifying whether the zoneis text, image, or both.andP;  You can save all of these as separate documents.andM;You can create templates of the areas of the page that are to be scanned andspell-checked, and you can even tell TopScan to flag suspect words orcharacters that might be misplaced (a drop cap, for example), so that you caneasily locate them in a word processor.andP;  All recognized text retains itspoint size and style, given the appropriate settings.andM;With the CDP/9000, it's also possible to batch-process previously scannedfiles, so you can scan during the day and process overnight.andP;  You simplyselect the Defer Processing option during the initial scan and then issue theProcess Deferred Documents command later.andP;  You can select as many deferreddocuments as you want, and you can even set a maximum recognition time so theprogram won't spend more than a set amount of time per page.andP;  This is usefulif you've accidentally put a sheet in upside down, for example - TopScanabandons the troublesome page and moves on to recognizing the rest of thescans.andM;Calera had its act together when it devised this product.andP;  And it hasn'ttaken long for this to come to the attention of some major companies - Apple,for instance.andP;  Apple uses the CDP 9000 and TopScan to process the thousandsof resumds it receives each month.andP;  Your resume doesn't molder in somebody'sfile cabinet - it molders in a VAX.andM;Paraliel Reader.andP;  Caere all but invented Mac-based OCR when it introducedOmniPage a year and a half ago, and it's now making its bid for the corporatehigh-end OCR market with a hardware/software combo called the ParallelReader.andM;At $10,995, the Parallel Reader might be an attractive alternative forcompanies unable to justify or pay the hefty price for the Calera system.andO;But there are some rather pronounced differences between the two systemsbesides the price tag.andM;This device, a rather austere-looking black box, is actually anIBM-compatible PC that you network to your Mac.andP;  It houses four OCRprocessing boards (dramatically speeding up multipage scanning, because itcan process four pages at a time) and an 80386sx processor.andP;  Also includedare a 16-bit VGA video card, a 40-megabyte internal hard-diskdrive, and a5.25-inch 1.2-megabyte floppy-disk drive.andM;You must add on one of the three scanners it supports (the Fujitsu 3093, theHP ScanJet Plus, or the Microtek MSII), an ADF (automatic document feeder), akeyboard, and a monitor.andP;  And that's not all.andP;  You need networking software(I used TOPS) and cables.andP;  And you may have to use file-translating softwaresuch as MacLink Plus to convert the DOS files the Parallel Reader deposits onyour Mac's hard disk.andP;  On the other hand, if you save the scanned files inWord or WordPerfect formats, the Mac versions of those programs can open andconvert the files without any problems.andM;Caere actually installed the configuration I tested (and dealers are supposedto do this for you as well), so I can't comment on how long it might take youto set it up for yourself.andP;  But even with everything installed, it tookseveral false starts before I could convince TOPS to function and the unit toaccess the scanner properly.andM;The software? It's essentially OmniPage without the Mac face and minus theability to check spelling - even though a spelling-checker feature ismentioned in the manuals (Caere plans to implement this feature in a futurerelease).andP;  When used for scanning single pages, it roughly matches theperformance of OmniPage on the Mac, but as I mentioned previously, it'sgenerally slower sometimes decidedly so - than the CDP 9000.andM;It has settings for dot-matrix documents, style retention, and so on butnothing as startling as TopScan's style sheets.andP;  You can save scan files in avariety of DOS formats, so the time you save in OCR you may lose during thetranslation unless you save them in Word or WordPerfect formats, as notedearlier.andP;  And as with the CDP, you can scan images and text at the same time,saving them to separate documents.andP;  You can store the graphichs as eithercompressed or uncompressed TIFF, but again in DOS format.andP;  You need a programsuch as MacLink Plus to convert them into Mac files.andM;The Parallel Reader does speed up multipage OCR work, and it allows for batchdeferred processing, much as the CDP unit does.andP;  I particularly liked thefact that you can pause the Parallel Reader during a scan run when the ADFbin is empty, rather than close the current job as completed.andP;  This is greatfor multipage jobs that the ADF can't accommodate.andP;  But the variousdisadvantages noted earlier tarnish the gleam.andP;  In particular, the necessityof dealing with DOS adds to the overall confusion- at least for peopleaccustomed to the Mac way of doing things.andM;The Bottom Line.andP;  If money is not an issue, Calera's unit is really the onlyway to go.andP;  The CDP 9000/TopScan's support of style sheets and its extensiveformatting options are exceptional.andP;  The duo excels at multipage OCR runs andbatch processing.andM;Caere's Parallel Reader promises the latter features as well - and to someextent it delivers the goods - but it also forces you to do DOS and totranslate your files into Mac format.andP;  Although the software operates underthe relatively friendly environment of a run-time version of Windows, youneed considerable DOS background to gear the whole mechanism into motion.andO;It's cheaper than the Calera approach, but it's definitely a kludge solution.andM;The CDP 9000, on the other hand, offers greater speed, accuracy, andconvenience.andP;  It offers all the instant gratification that the plug-and-playMac crowd is accustomed to.andP;  Your office will never be the same again.andM;COP 9000/TopScan for the MacandM;*****Manufactured by: CaleraandM;Recognition Systems, Inc., 2500andM;Augustine Drive, Santa Clara, CAandM;95054; (408) 986-8006.andM;List Price: CDP 9000/TopScan,andM;$31,950; CDP 6000, $19,950;andM;TopScan only, $2,995.andM;Papallel ReadepandM;AllandM;Manufactured by: Caere Corp.,andM;100 Cooper Court, Los Gatos,andM;CA 95030; (800) 535-7226.andM;List Price: $10,995.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
