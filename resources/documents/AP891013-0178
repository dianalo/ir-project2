News that bidders had failed to raise financing for the planned$6.75 billion buyout of UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, alsospread panic that billions of dollars in other planneddebt-financed deals would have to be scrapped.   ``No one thinks this is the bottom,'' said a high-yield bondtrader at a major Wall Street firm who asked not to be named.   The decline Friday came in what already has been the worstshakeout ever in the junk bond market, which boomed in the 1980s ona wave of highly leveraged takeovers financed by the high-risksecurities.   The junk bond market decline began in September when CampeauCorp. had to get a $250 million loan to meet its junk bondobligations. Since then, Ohio Mattress Co. scrapped a $475 millionissue and Ramada Inc. postponed indefinitely a $400 million issue.   Prices of junk bonds _ so named because of their low creditratings _ dropped for the 17th straight day Friday. Traders saidthe afternoon plunge was triggered by the 190-point drop on the NewYork Stock Exchange's Dow Jones industrials average, the worst thisyear, which had been sparked by news of the UAL financing failure.   Junk bond issues were down on average about 1{ points to 2points, or as much as $20 for every $1,000 in face amount. RJRHoldings Capital Corp. bonds, considered a ``quality'' issue,plummeted 3 points. R.H. Macy andamp; Co. bonds plunged 2 points.   Western Union bonds droppped a whopping 15 points, in partbecause of reports of a possible bankruptcy filing. QuantumChemicals, considered a less attractive issue, fell from 5 pointsto 7 points, traders said.   ``There's an eerie silence in the junk bond market. There's notrading taking place,'' said John Lonski, senior economist atMoody's Investors Service, a major credit rating agency.   ``We face the problem of an eventual selloff where a number ofjunk bond holders will just want to get out and assume significantlosses in the process,'' he said.   Gauging activity in the overall junk market can be difficult,because most trading takes place over-the-counter _ that is,between dealers who negotiate the price to be paid for a given bond_ instead of in bidding on an open exchange.   That same characteristic also can heighten big selloffs bymaking it more difficult to find buyers when the market is weak orfalling.   Very few junk bonds are listed on the American and New YorkStock exchanges and tallies on overall market volume are notavailable daily.   Failure of the UAL deal heightened fears because while part ofthe financing was expected to come from junk bonds, traditionalbank financing was to play a major role.   ``If banks backed off that it's not a good sign for the rest ofthe market,'' Lonski said.   About $11 billion in new junk bond offerings from companiesincluding Continental Airlines, Blockbuster Entertainment, GrandUnion and CNW Corp.'s Chicago andamp; North Western railroad arescheduled to occur by the end of the year.</TEXT></DOC>
