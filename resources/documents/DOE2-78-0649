The removing and passing steps produce a firstgas which contains the methane from the sample but which is free of water,carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, interfering gases, and hydrocarbonshaving at least two carbon atoms; converting the methane in the firstgas to form a condensed carbon dioxide sample; carrying out the removing,passing, and converting steps under a continuous subatmospheric pressurein such a manner as to prevent condensation of any oxygen in the cryogenictrap and to prevent any atmospheric carbon dioxide from entering intothe sample, the first gas, the cryogenic trap, and the condensed carbondioxide sample; determining the stable carbon isotope ratio of the condensedcarbon dioxide sample which can be then be used to predict the hydrocarbonpotential of the earth formation.</TEXT></DOC>
