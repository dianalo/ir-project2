Keating Jr. would testify or remainsilent.   ``Until he sits down'' on Tuesday, ``we don't know what he'sgoing to do,'' Joseph Lewis, a spokeman for the panel, said ofKeating, a Phoenix, Ariz., billionaire and owner of the nowcollapsed Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.   Keating contributed $1.3 million to the political causes of fiveU.S. senators whose intervention with federal regulators in early1987 on behalf of Lincoln is now being investigated by the Senateethics committee.   He was subpoenaed last month to be the final witness at theHouse panel's hearing into why top regulators waited until April toseize Lincoln _ two years after government examiners firstrecommended its takeover.   As the target of a federal grand jury probe in Los Angeles,Keating was being advised by attorneys to invoke a constitutionalright not to testify, according to one of his associates andcongressional sources, all of whom spoke on the condition ofanonymity.   ``He has every intention of appearing,'' said Bradley Boland,Keating's son-in-law and executive vice president of his AmericanContinental Corp. of Phoenix, Lincoln's holding company. ``Whathe's going to say when he gets there, I don't know.''   Also in Los Angeles, investors in $200 million in bonds sold byAmerican Continental asked a federal court Monday to freeze morethan $100 million they said was illegally transferred to banksoverseas. U.S. District Judge Steve Wilson scheduled a hearing Dec.4 on the request.   The committee also was scheduled to hear Tuesday from M. DannnyWall, who as chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board removedjurisdiction over Lincoln from the agency's San Francicso officeafter regulators there recommended closing it down.   The House panel's chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,repeatedly has blamed Wall for allowing Lincoln to remain open asits losses mounted and has asked President Bush to fire Wall. Theestimated cost of the federal rescue of Lincoln is $2 billion.   Wall, in turn, has repeatedly accused Gonzalez of conducting theLincoln hearings unfairly in refusing to allow him to testify untilTuesday.   Other witnesses Tuesday include Rosemary Stewart and DarrelDochow, Wall's top aides at the bank board and the agency thatreplaced it last summer, the Office of Thrift Supervision, as partof a $150 billion-plus taxpayer bailout of the Sandamp;L industry.   Dochow assumed responsibility for regulating Lincoln after Wallstripped the agency's San Franciso office of that role. Ms. Stewartis the author of a 1988 side letter to a memorandum ofunderstanding between the bank board and Lincoln assuring thethrift that no information about its activites would be referred tocriminal authorities.   ``We have both ends of the string here: the regulator and theowner of the institution,'' said Lewis. ``If both parties areforthcoming, we should walk out of there with all the mysteriespretty much unraveled.''   According to congressional sources, Keating's attorneys lastweek asked the committee if he could invoke his Fifth Amendmentright to not answer questions without having to appear before thepanel.   Lewis confirmed there had been several phone conversations inthe past week between the committee's lawyers and attorneys forKeating but would not discuss their content. Keating's primaryattorney in the case, John Quinn of Los Angeles, did not returnphone calls to his office Monday.   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard C. Breedentold the House panel last week that his agency has turned overinformation to a criminal grand jury investigating Keating.   Breeden also said that the SEC's own investigation of Keatingand his companies rivals in size its probe of convicted stocktrader Ivan Boesky and other inside dealings on Wall Street andthat he is willing to further double the resources devoted to it ifnecessary.   Lincoln was seized by the bank board one day after its holdingcompany, American Continental, filed for bankruptcy reorganization.Regulators have complained that the bankruptcy move has preventedthem from obtaining records to determine the extent of Lincoln'slosses.   But they have filed a suit against Keating and his associatesalleging that fraud, racketeering and a variety of other illegalacts were directly responsible for losses of $1.1 billion.   The Senate ethics committee, meanwhile, last week hired anoutside private counsel to investigate the role of the fivesenators who received a total of $1.3 million from Keating.   The senators _ Alan Cranston, D-Calif,; Dennis DeConcini,D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., andJohn Glenn, D-Ohio _ have all denied any wrongdoing.</TEXT></DOC>
