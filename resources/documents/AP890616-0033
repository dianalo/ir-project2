The officials acknowledged Thursday they have no hard evidence todispute official assertions in Cuba that Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa wastaken into custody because he had engaged in ``grave acts ofcorruption and dishonest use of economic resources.''   But the officials, all insisting on anonymity, also said theycould not rule out the possibility that there was more to the arrestthan meets the eye. A number of Ochoa's subordinates were reportedto have been arrested as well.   Cuba has thus far been generally immune to the kind of upheavalsthat have afflicted other communist states and has refused toundertake the reforms being practiced in the Soviet Union andelsewhere.   One reason for the official caution here in assessing thesituation is that rumors of high-level discontent have circulated inCuba for 30 years but outright acts of rebellion have beenexceedingly rare.   Under the rule of President Fidel Castro, Cuba has been one ofthe most stable countries in the communist world or in Latin America.   Ochoa is a veteran of fighting in Angola and Ethiopia and alsoserved as commander of Cuban forces in Nicaragua in the mid-1980s.According to Rafael Fermoselle, a Cuban exile and an expert on theCuban military, Ochoa was awarded the title ``Hero of theRevolution'' in 1984.   A Council of State resolution, approved on Jan. 1, 1984, saidthat Ochoa ``carried out several internationalist missions with aparticular spirit of sacrifice'' and he was cited for a ``brilliantperformance as commander of Cuban troops in Ethiopia,'' Fermosellehas written. Ochoa also was praised for ``his honesty,unselfishness, spirit of sacrifice, purity, desire to excel andheroism.''   Ochoa joined Castro's rebel army in 1958. Among the importantpositions he has held was Commander of the Army in Havana. InNicaragua, Ochoa commanded Cuban forces believed to number about 500.   Gen. Rafael Del Pino, the highest ranking military officer everto defect from Cuba, disclosed Thursday that Defense Minister RaulCastro, brother of the president, had said in a speech Wednesdaythat many of Ochoa's subordinates were arrested as well.   Del Pino, who defected two years ago, said he believes that thearrests were based on a high-level of discontent within Ochoa'scommand which ``could have led to an uprising'' against Castro.   Del Pino said he believes there was a relationship between thearrest of Ochoa on Wednesday and the sacking of TransportationMinister Diocles Torralba the day before.   He said Torralba, during his military career, was one of the``most beloved and intelligent'' officers and had become ``the bestprepared and most intelligent personality in the Cuban government.''</TEXT></DOC>
