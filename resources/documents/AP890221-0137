(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Anglers who find nothing appealing about thegreat outdoors when their catch comes up short will be able to tipthe scales in their favor with a new device: fax machines.   Beginning in May, fishermen on Lake Michigan will be able to usefax machines to receive the latest weather satellite maps.   The maps will tell where the cold water meets warm water, whichis where steelhead trout swim, said Allen Miller, a spokesman forthe project of the Sea Grant Institute at the University ofWisconsin-Madison.   ``The change in temperatures and water coming up from lowerdepths tends to concentrate bait fish and insects, which in turnattracts the trout,'' Miller said.   Satellites send information, including the surface watertemperature, to a receiver in Wallops Island, Va. The information isrelayed to the university by another satellite.</TEXT><DATELINE>WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The campus may be dull and brown thesedays, but 60 tons of manmade snow will give prospective students adifferent view of Williams College.   Because of a snowless winter in the Berkshires, the collegeMonday trucked in the snow for photographs for a Williamspromotional brochure.   ``We're not faking anything,'' Philip F. Smith, director ofadmissions, said as workers spread the white stuff from a nearby skiarea in front of a dormitory and the geology building. ``We are justhoping to get some good winter shots.''   Student models posed amid the manmade drifts. About 30,000 copiesof the brochure are mailed to high school students each year.   By late Tuesday morning, only a ``lump or two'' of the importedsnow was left. The campus was soggy under a spring-like rain andtemperatures were expected to reach the unseasonable 50s, saidspokeswoman Ellen Barek.   The northern Berkshire Mountains, which normally receive 50 to 55inches of snow by this time of year, have received only about 18inches, said John Hockridge of the New England Weather Associatesoffice in nearby North Adams.   ``We only get to redo this brochure once every five years,'' saidJames Kolesar of the college's publicity office. ``To have abrochure of Williams that did not have winter shots would be verydishonest.''</TEXT></DOC>
