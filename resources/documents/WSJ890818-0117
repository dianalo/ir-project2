The Lockheed Corp.-built missile, successful in 16 of 19 launches from land in a testing program that started January 1987, failed catastrophically in a sea launch Tuesday for the second time in three tries since March. An Aug. 2 test was successful.    Yesterday, the Navy confirmed a New York Times report saying that the service believes engineers miscalculated the amount of pressure the missile encounters during an undersea launch and didn't account for certain effects of the missile's movement through the water. The errors, the Navy said, occurred even though numerous computer simulations were used during the missile's development.    Despite the two recent failures, Navy officials maintained that the Trident's design problems could be corrected so that the missile can begin to take its place in the fleet on schedule in 1990. A Navy spokesman said senior admirals retain &quot;full confidence&quot; in the missile, adding that &quot;no impact is presently foreseen&quot; on long-range plans to make the missiles the centerpiece of the U.S. submarine fleet's nuclear armaments.    Navy officials went out of their way to emphasize that Lockheed probably wouldn't be held responsible for the Trident's technical problems.    In Sunnyvale, Calif., a spokesman for the aerospace and electronics giant's Lockheed Missiles andamp; Space Co. unit wouldn't comment on the Navy's remarks about the Trident II, saying the prime contractor was &quot;awaiting analysis of test data.&quot; The spokesman for the unit of Lockheed, based in Calabasas, Calif., said that Lockheed has been prime contractor on previous Polaris and Trident submarine-launched missiles and said &quot;obviously it has been an excellent long-term program.&quot;    Over the past two years, the Navy has earmarked about $4 billion to buy some 132 Trident II missiles, and the Bush administration has strongly resisted congressional efforts to trim that spending.    Trident II is the sixth generation of submarine-based missile systems that Lockheed has developed with the Navy in programs dating back to the Polaris of the 1950s and later the Poseidon and Trident I. And the long history had seemed to help give the latest missile a special place among weapons programs. Last year the House Armed Services Committee rated the Trident II program as best-managed among all strategic programs.    At the Pentagon, Trident II development long has been touted as an example of a program that has been able to cut through bureaucratic red tape and the development has given lower-level managers greater authority to make decisions. Before the test firings, Navy officials also boasted that the Trident program has saved untold millions of dollars by streamlining cumbersome design and acquisition rules.    By contrast, some industry and congressional critics contend that the Lockheed program was in serious trouble long before the unsuccessful launches. Former Pentagon acquisition officials and Senate Armed Services Committee aides, for example, previously estimated that the Trident program was at least six months behind schedule and faced cost overruns of 15% or more through the mid-1990s.    The three-stage missile, which has a range of about 4,600 miles, is designed to take advantage of the newest advances in missile engines and in ways to reduce drag during flight.    Before the test failures, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's aides praised the Trident II program as the portion of the Pentagon's nuclear modernization program that didn't require major adjustments or prolonged negotiations with lawmakers. </TEXT></DOC>
