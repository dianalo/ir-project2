Subroto told a luncheon audience of about 1,600 that theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was determined thatrecent oil market turmoil never be repeated.   ``One need only look back three years to witness the collapse ofprices in the international oil market, which brought in its wakechaos in the energy industry,'' Subroto said.   The 13-nation cartel agreed last November to limit itsproduction to levels that would support a benchmark price of $18 abarrel, about 18.5 million barrels a day. The action has helpedcrude prices recover from their October 1988 lows of near $12 abarrel.   OPEC plans to review its production at a meeting scheduled tobegin June 5 in Vienna, Austria. There has been speculation thecartel would increase its self-imposed production limits if demandwas strong enough to support higher output without depressingprices.   Subroto pointed to several inherent oil market factors thatcause instability, including the different levels of oil reservesin OPEC member countries and the varying views leaders of thosecountries have on long-term pricing.   He also pointed to regionalization of the world oil market.``Because of the dispersal of these regional markets, our membercountries' crudes are either long-haul or short-haul, which impliescertain market disadvantages based on the relative costs of movingthem to the market.''   Subroto also said situations where member nations aredissatisfied with their assigned quotas and unilaterally increasedproduction were destabilizing.   Declaring there was no need for concern by U.S. consumers aboutthe security of OPEC-supplied oil, Subroto also said he expectedsecurity of demand.   ``In return for OPEC's commitment to security of supply,therefore, our organization is entitled to expect from consumers,policies which promote an orderly transition from finite oilreserves to other energy resources _ policies which do not seek, atany cost, to throttle oil demand,'' he said.   ``The real need is for total cooperation in defense of marketstability and not in defiance of market forces,'' he said.   Later at a news conference, Subroto said the cartel's history ofinstability was behind it.   ``OPEC now is a different OPEC,'' Subroto said. ``Thecomposition of oil ministers is different...more technocratic, morebusinesslike.''</TEXT></DOC>
