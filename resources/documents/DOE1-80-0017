At the present time its place remains unchallenged in the investigationof selected patients with cerebral ischaemia, in elucidation of the causeof intracranial hemmorrhage and in the diagnosis of aneurysm and angiomatousmalformation. In acute cranial trauma, inflammatory lesions and congenitalanomalies it is virtually unnecessary and its place in tumour diagnosishas changed from detection of the lesion to elucidation of its natureand relationships prior to surgery in a limited number of cases. Diminishingdiagnostic use is compensated by an increasing therapeutic application.Detachable balloons for occlusion of large fistulae and particulate embolifor treatment of dural angiomatous malformation and tumours suppliedby external carotid branches are now used routinely. Embolisation oflesions in the territory of vessels which supply brain tissue and theuse of intravascular glues and silicones are promising advances whichare still at the experimental stage.</TEXT></DOC>
