The purpose of the Act is to vest title to certainabandoned shipwrecks that are located in State waters to the respectiveStates, and to clarify that the States have management authority over thoseabandoned shipwrecks. Prior to enactment, many States claimed title and management authorityover abandoned shipwrecks in their waters, and managed historic shipwrecksin a manner consistent with State historic preservation programs. However,under principles of admiralty law, Federal courts could assert jurisdictionover abandoned shipwrecks and treat historic shipwrecks as commoditieslost at sea that are in marine peril and should be salvaged and returnedto commerce. Salvage awards often disregarded a shipwreck's historicalvalue, with the resultant loss of important historical and archeologicalinformation. Enactment of the Abandoned Shipwreck Act clarifies the situation by assertingFederal title to certain abandoned shipwrecks located in State waters,and then simultaneously transferring title to the majority of those shipwrecksto the States to manage and protect. In addition, the Act directs the National Park Service to prepare and publish,within nine months of enactment, advisory guidelines to assist the Statesand Federal agencies in developing legislation and regulations to carryout their responsibilities under the Act. The Act also requires that theNational Park Service consult with the various public and private sectorinterests prior to developing the guidelines. Although the National Park Service consulted with the various interestgroups prior to developing the guidelines being issued hereinbelow, theService would like to provide the public with the additional opportunityto review and comment on the guidelines as proposed. Comments receivedduring the six month comment period will be fully considered and incorporated,as appropriate, into final guidelines. <ITAG tagnum="84">Section by Section Analysis of the Act and its Legislative History\1\</ITAG><T3>Section</T3><NOTE/> 1: Section 1 provides a short title for Pub. L. 100-298,the Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Senate Report No. 100-241 (Committee on Energy and NaturalResources) and House Report No. 100-514, Part 1 (Committee on Interiorand Insular Affairs) and Part 2 (Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries).<T3>Section 2: </T3>Section 2 of the Act presents Congressional findingsthat the States have responsibility for managing a broad range of resources,including certain abandoned shipwrecks, that are located in State watersand submerged lands. The legislative history notes that, with the exceptionof warships and other public vessels, abandonment may be implied or inferredin those instances when an owner has not made a claim of possession orany control over the wreck. Abandonment of warships and other public vesselsrequires an affirmative act of abandonment on the part of the sovereignnation holding title. <T3>Section 3: </T3>Section 3 of the Act contains definitions for the terms``embedded,'' ``National Register,'' ``public lands,'' ``lndian lands,''``lndian tribe,'' ``shipwreck,'' ``State,'' and ``submerged lands.'' Thelegislative history clarifies Congressional intent for two terms. In regard to the term ``embedded,'' the Congress considers the tools ofexcavation required to gain access to an ``embedded'' shipwreck to notinclude diving equipment normally worn by recreational divers while exploringor viewing shipwreck sites. ``Submerged lands'' are defined in reference to the Submerged Lands Act(43 U.S.C. 1301) plus three other statutes (48 U.S.C. 749; 48 U.S.C. 1705;48 U.S.C. 1681) that describe the lands of Puerto Rico, Guam, the VirginIslands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. ``Submergedlands'' are considered to be lands extending out three nautical miles froma State's coastline. The Congress notes that Texas, Florida, and PuertoRico have submerged lands extending beyond three nautical miles, whichwas the limit of the United States territorial sea at the time of enactmentof the Act, and directs those States to exercise their jurisdiction overabandoned shipwrecks beyond three nautical miles consistent with internationallaw principles. Although the President issued Proclamation 5928 on December27, 1988, to extend the limit of the United States territorial sea to 12nautical miles, it does not extend or otherwise alter existing Federalor State laws, or any jurisdiction, rights, legal interests, or obligationsderived therefrom. Accordingly, Proclamation 5928 does not affect the AbandonedShipwreck Act. <T3>Section 4: </T3>Section 4(a) of the Act sets forth Congressional policyon how the States are to carry out their responsibilities under the Act.The States are directed to develop policies for managing shipwrecks undertheir jurisdiction so as to protect natural resources and habitat areas,guarantee recreational exploration of shipwreck sites, and allow for appropriatepublic and private sector recovery of shipwrecks consistent with the protectionof the site's historical values and environmental integrity. The legislative history clearly indicates that the Congress intends forthe States to provide sport divers with unrestricted recreational accessto all non-historic shipwrecks, consistent with human safety or the fragilityof a particular shipwreck. However, State laws are to provide a methodof legal recourse to persons denied access. Although the Congress distinguishesnon-destructive access from access for salvage or the collection of artifactsfrom historic shipwrecks, it does not intend for the States to discourageprivate salvage if it is consistent with the protection of a shipwrecksite's historical values and environmental integrity. Section 4(b) of the Act directs the States to establish underwater parksto protect shipwreck sites, and to make funds available from the HistoricPreservation Fund for the study, interpretation, protection, and preservationof historic shipwrecks. Language in the legislative history encouragesthe States to work with sport divers to locate shipwrecks and establishunderwater parks. <T3>Section 5: </T3>Sections 5 (a) and (c) of the Act direct the NationalPark Service to prepare and publish, within nine months of enactment, guidelinesto assist the States and appropriate Federal agencies in developing legislationand regulations to carry out their responsibilities under the Act. Theguidelines are intended to enhance cultural resources, foster a partnershipamong the interest groups, facilitate recreational access and use, andrecognize the interests of those engaged in shipwreck discovery or salvage.In the legislative history for section 5 of the Act, the Congress encouragesthe Service to consider current recreational and archeological uses indeveloping the guidelines. Identifying human safety, fragility, or particularshipwrecks as legitimate reasons for limiting full access, the Congressreiterates its intention that sport divers be allowed access to historicshipwrecks to the fullest extent practicable. The Congress also distinguishessport diver access from access for the collection of artifacts. Section 5(b) of the Act requires that the Service prepare the guidelinesafter consulting with various public and private sector interests. TheAct and the legislative history identify such interests to include sportdivers, dive operators, salvors, fishermen, archeologists, historic preservationists,State tourism industry and natural resource department representatives,the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United StatesDepartment of Commerce, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation,and State Historic Preservation Officers. The Congress encourages the Serviceto establish a committee of these interest groups to assist in developmentof the guidelines. Recognizing that the guidelines are advisory in nature,the Congress intends for the States to develop programs, or review andrevise existing programs, that conform with the Act and the guidelines,and are consistent from State to State. If a State program appears to beinconsistent with the Act and the guidelines, the Congress intends thatany affected party may bring that fact to the State's attention and thatlegal recourse should be provided under State law.Federal agencies are directed to manage historic shipwrecks under theircontrol or jurisdiction in a manner consistent with applicable Federalstatutes and, to the extent possible, the advisory guidelines issued pursuantto section 5 of the Act. <T3>Section 6: </T3>Section 6(a) of the Act asserts United States titleto three categories of abandoned shipwrecks: those that are embedded ina State's submerged lands; those that are embedded in coralline formationsprotected by a State on its submerged lands; and those that are locatedon a State's submerged lands and are included in or determined eligiblefor inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places by the Secretaryof the Interior. Procedures for listing or determining historic propertieseligible for inclusion in the National Register are found at 36 CFR Parts60 and 63. Section 6(b) of the Act requires that the public be given notice of thoseshipwrecks to which United States title is asserted, primarily to ensurethat sport divers and other interest groups know which shipwrecks are historicallysignificant. However, in the legislative history the Congress notes thatdisclosure of locational information sometimes results in damage, vandalismand pilferage. The Congress suggests that the State or Federal agency havingjurisdiction vary the degree of specificity in regard to disclosure oflocational information, depending upon the particular circumstances. Pursuant to section 6(c), with two exceptions, simultaneous with UnitedStates assertion of title, the United States transferred that title tothe respective State in or on whose submerged lands the shipwreck is located.Section (d) identifies the exceptions as those shipwrecks located on public(meaning Federal) and Indian lands. Title to shipwrecks located on publiclands remains with the Federal Government while title to shipwrecks locatedon Indian lands remains with the Indian tribe owning such lands. Titleto United States warships also remains with the United States unless thattitle is abandoned by affirmative act. The Congress notes that mere passageof time or lack of positive assertions of rights are insufficient to establishabandonment of such shipwrecks. The Congress notes in the legislative history that some National Parksare located on lands that are State-owned. In such cases, the Congressrecommends that the State and the National Park Service enter into managementagreements to ensure that the Service protects any abandoned historic shipwreckswithin the park's boundaries. Section 6(e) of the Act reserves certain rights by the United States andthe States under the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and the Rivers and Harbors Act (33 U.S.C. 401 <T3>et seq.</T3>). <T3>Section 7: </T3>Section 7(a) of the Act specifies that the law of salvageand the law of finds do not apply to abandoned shipwrecks to which theUnited States asserted title under the Act. The legislative history indicatesthat the Congress modified admiralty law in this manner because it doesnot believe that the shipwrecks covered by the Act are in marine peril.The Congress views shipwrecks not only as commercial resources, but asimportant recreational and archeological resources as well. The legislativehistory indicates that the Congress believes the States are better equippedthan the Federal admiralty courts to manage these resources. State HistoricPreservation Officers are identified as the entity best suited to preservehistoric shipwrecks in State waters. The legislative history notes thatall other shipwrecks not covered by the Act, including those in Federalwaters, remain subject to admiralty law. Section 7(b) of the Act states that the Act shall not change the laws ofthe United States relating to shipwrecks, other than those to which theAct applies. The legislative history identifies the Marine Protection,Research and Sanctuaries Act (16 U.S.C. 1431 <T3>et seq.</T3>) as an example, noting that the Act does not affect theauthority of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to designateand manage nationally significant shipwrecks within national marine sanctuariesin State waters. Section 7(c) of the Act states that the Act shall not affect any legalproceeding brought prior to the date of enactment of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Preparation of the Guidelines </ITAG><T3>Public Meetings. </T3>To provide the public with the maximum opportunityto comment on the development of the guidelines, the National Park Servicescheduled and held 11 public meetings during the months of September andOctober 1988. These meetings were announced by publishing two notices inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 31941, August 22, 1988; and 53 FR 38792,October 3, 1988), issuing news releases nationally and locally, and sendingannouncements to over 2,000 interest groups, individuals, and editors ofpertinent newsletters, magazines and journals. Approximately 500 people attended the public meetings, which were heldin Washington, DC; San Francisco, CA; Seattle, WA; Austin, TX; Beaufort,NC; Colchester, VT; Lyndhurst, NJ; Madison, WI; Tampa, FL; New Orleans,LA; and Charleston, SC. Over 120 people presented statements to voice theiropinions or that of their organizations. These statements are recordedin 769 pages of transcripts.\2\<NOTE/> In addition, about 130 people sent letters to the NationalPark Service to express their opinions or that of the organization theyrepresent.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Copies of the transcripts are available for purchase fromCapital Hill Reporting, Inc., P.O. Box 27083, Washington, DC 20038-7083,telephone (202) 789-0818. In addition, each of the 11 hosts for the publicmeetings has a copy of the hosted meeting's transcript available for viewing.The Washington, DC, office of the National Park Service has copies of transcriptsfor all 11 public meetings available for viewing. Addresses for the hostsare contained in 53 FR 31941 and 53 FR 38792. Forty-five percent of the commenters were sport divers, dive boat operators,dive instructors, or represented dive clubs. Twenty-four percent were professionalor avocational archeologists, conservators, or historic preservationists.Sixteen percent represented local, State or Federal agencies. Ten percentwere commercial or treasure salvors. The remaining five percent includeda marine biologist and individuals who did not affiliate themselves withany particular interest group. The two <T4>Federal Register </T4>notices (53 FR 31941 and 53 FR 38792) which announcedthe public meetings asked commenters to address eight issues identifiedby the National Park Service to be of major concern to the various publicand private interest groups. The eight questions asked and a summary ofthe comments received are presented below. <T3>1. How should an historic shipwreck be defined? </T3>Many commenters agreed that the criteria used for determining a property'seligibility to the National Register of Historic Places was sufficientfor defining an historic shipwreck. Commenters noted that States are familiarwith the National Register criteria and that many States already use thecriteria or similar specifications for historic shipwreck management. Severalcommenters stated that the definition of what is an historic shipwreckshould be based not on age but, rather, on the historical significanceof each shipwreck on a case by case basis. Other commenters felt that agewas a strong determining factor, if not the only criteria for definingan historic shipwreck. Opinions on the age by which a shipwreck shouldbe considered historic ranged from shipwrecks as young as 10 years in ageto only those over 500 years in age. <T3>2. Should the States retain title to all artifacts and materials recoveredfrom abandoned historic shipwrecks? If not, what portion should be retained?</T3>A large number of commenters stated that States should retain title toall artifacts recovered from historic shipwrecks. Other commenters favoreddividing artifacts between the State and the finder or salvor, using an80/20 or 75/25 split. Many commenters felt that artifacts should be exhibitedin museums and other locations. A few commenters suggested that exact artifactduplicates should be given to the finder, loaned to museums, or sold tofund shipwreck management programs and activities. <T3>3. What, if any, restrictions should be placed on sport divers, salvors,fishermen, scientific researchers, and others desiring access to abandonedhistoric shipwreck sites? </T3>Most commenters stated that sport divers should have unrestricted accessto abandoned historic shipwreck sites for exploration as long as thereis no disturbance of the site. Some commenters stated that unique sitesshould be protected from all user groups until States could determine thesite's historical significance and fragility. Other commenters suggestedthat access be restricted when a shipwreck site was under investigationby archeologists or salvors. Restrictions for salvors were urged, althoughfew specific recommendations were made.<T3>4. What, if any, restrictions should be placed on sport divers, salvors,fishermen, scientific researchers, and others on removal of artifacts fromabandoned historic shipwreck sites? </T3>While many commenters advocated having no restrictions on artifact removalfrom historic shipwrecks, just as many recommended that some kinds of restrictionsbe imposed. Suggestions ranged from prohibiting artifact retrieval to issuingpermits for recovery of artifacts. Many commenters recommended that permitsbe required for any person to conduct archeological recovery or salvage.In addition, it was recommended that only professional underwater archeologistsor maritime historians, or wreck divers under their supervision, be allowedto remove artifacts. It also was recommended that any removal of artifactsbe done in accordance with an archeological recovery plan approved by theState. <T3>5. What, if any, penalties or fines should be assessed against sportdivers, salvors, fishermen, scientific researchers, and others who violateprovisions in a State's program to manage historic shipwrecks? </T3>Many commenters felt that the establishment of penalties or fines wouldalienate the sport diving community and, thereby, discourage cooperationand information sharing with the State. Many commenters felt that penaltiesnot only would be difficult to enforce, but also were viewed as unnecessarybecause divers monitor themselves. However, other commenters stated thatpenalties and fines were a necessary deterrent for noncompliance. Mostcommenters stated that if fines and penalties were imposed, they shouldbe fair, reasonable, and flexible. Suggested penalties included misdemeanorand felony fines, confiscation of equipment and boats, and prison sentences.Other commenters recommended applying the same fines and penalties forsubmerged lands as those used for dry land. <T3>6. Should monetary rewards or other incentives be made available forreporting the discovery of historic shipwreck sites or the violation ofprovisions in a State's program? </T3>The majority of commenters favored providing monetary rewards and otherincentives for reporting discoveries of historic shipwreck sites. Suggestionsincluded awarding a percentage of the value of the find or the overallcost of the archeological project, providing tax benefits, awarding moneyfrom the sale of artifacts, issuing certificates and awards of appreciation,providing an opportunity to assist in documenting and recovering the site,and allowing the finder to keep artifacts. Other commenters felt that monetaryrewards and incentives were unnecessary, and that people should reportdiscoveries and violations as a matter of civic duty without any compensation.Others pointed out that State budgets generally are limited and that anymonies made available for shipwreck programs should be directed towardidentifying, evaluating and protecting historic shipwreck sites. Regarding the reporting of violations in a State's program, some commentersfelt a system such as an anonymous hot line should be established. A fewcommenters were concerned that such a system could be abused by personsreporting false violators. Other commenters felt that providing incentivesand monetary rewards for reporting program violations would foster an attitudeof mistrust among the diving community, commercial salvors, and professionalarcheologists. <T3>7. Should the States provide training courses to sport divers on archeologicalmethods that would lead to paraprofessional certification? </T3>A majority of commenters indicated that underwater archeology trainingcourses should be available to sport divers, but that the training shouldbe provided by the private sector rather than the State. This would relievethe cost burden from the States and the taxpayer, and would foster goodwillbetween the States and the diving community. Some commenters identifiedthe National Association of Underwater Instructors, the Professional Associationof Diving Instructors, and the Young Men's Christian Association as examplesof diving organizations that already have underwater archeology coursesas part of their diving certification training programs. Many commentersrecommended that professional underwater archeologists and maritime historiansbe involved in designing underwater archeology training courses and programsfor sport divers. <T3>8. Should the States encourage and use sport diver volunteers duringthe conduct of archeological surveys and excavations of historic shipwrecksites? </T3>Most commenters recommended that the States use volunteers, particularlyto locate, survey and map shipwreck sites. Some commenters thought volunteersshould participate only in survey work, although a few commenters includedartifact analysis and conservation activities as well. It was generallyfelt, however, that activities must be supervised by professionals andthat participation be preceded by formal archeological orientation throughtraining classes or field schools. Concern was expressed that volunteersnot be ``used and abused'' and that training requirements not be too strict.An additional consideration was the subject of insurance liability forvolunteers participation. <T3>Survey of Existing State Shipwreck Programs. </T3>To determine therange of existing shipwreck programs, the National Park Service developeda questionnaire that was sent to each State Historic Preservation Officerand State Archeologist on July 12, 1988. The questionnaire asked for informationon the State's existing authorities and jurisdiction as well as pendinglegislation and regulations. It also asked each State to provide informationon several topics anticipated to be of concern to various public and privatesector groups, including information on the State's preservation activities,recreational and educational activities, and commercial fishing and salvageactivities. Responses have been received from 47 (or 84 percent) of the 56 States andterritories polled. A brief summary of the responses is presented below.Although four of the nine States which have not responded are known tohave submerged lands that contain abandoned shipwrecks, the summary informationpresented in this <T4>Federal Register </T4> notice is considered to be representative ofState shipwreck programs. <T3>Authorities and Jurisdiction. </T3>Although 27 respondents indicatedthat their States have laws or regulations which authorize the managementof abandoned shipwrecks in State waters, only 20 respondents said thattheir States have programs to manage shipwrecks. Eighteen respondents indicatedthat their States currently are considering enacting (or revising) Statelaws or issuing (or revising) regulations which would authorize shipwreckprograms. One question asked respondents to identify which program area within theState has jurisdiction over the management of abandoned shipwrecks in Statewaters. The responses indicated that, in some States, only one programarea has jurisdiction while, in other States, several program areas havejurisdiction. Twenty-five respondents indicated that their State's historicpreservation agency or State Archeologist has some form of jurisdiction.Other program areas listed as having some kind of jurisdiction were agencies,departments, or commissions responsible for lands, parks and recreation,natural resources, conservation, environmental protection, transportation,community services, housing, and State. <T3>Preservation Activities. </T3>Twenty-two respondents indicated thattheir State's historic preservation plan includes consideration of abandonedhistoric shipwrecks. Twenty-four respondents indicated that their Stateuses the National Register of Historic Places criteria to determine ifa shipwreck is historic. Twelve other respondents indicated that Statelaws and/or regulations define what is a historic shipwreck. Twenty-four respondents indicated that their State makes funds availablefrom the Historic Preservation Fund for the identification, evaluation,interpretation, and/or preservation of historic shipwrecks. Seventeen respondentsnoted that their State employs underwater archeologists to inventory, evaluate,interpret and/or preserve historic shipwrecks. Thirty-one respondents indicated that their State regulates archeologicalresearch through a permitting process. Although 29 of those States requirearcheological permittees to preserve and conserve artifacts and materialsrecovered from historic shipwrecks, only 15 have access to curatorial andconservation facilities and qualified staff. Twenty-seven of those Statesretain title to all artifacts and materials recovered by archeologicalpermittees. <T3>Recreational and Educational Activities. </T3>Twenty-four respondentsindicated that their State provides access to shipwreck sites for recreationalexploration by sport divers, as long as the divers do not remove any artifactsor other items from historic shipwrecks.Fourteen of those States place some kind of restrictions on diver access.The most frequently cited reason for restricting diver access was if theshipwreck site is being archeologically studied or commercially salvagedunder a permit.Twenty-one respondents indicated that their State encourages and uses sportdiver volunteers to conduct archeological surveys and excavations of historicshipwreck sites. However, only three of those States provide training courseson archeological methods to sport divers. Three respondents noted thattheir State provides monetary rewards or other incentives to sport diversfor reporting the discovery of historic shipwreck sites.Five respondents indicated that their State has established and managesunderwater parks or areas to preserve and protect historic shipwrecks.Two respondents noted that their State has established and maintains underwatertrains for the enjoyment and education of sport divers. Nineteen respondentsindicated that their State provides courses, gives lectures, prepares exhibits,or issues publications to educate the general public on the values of historicshipwrecks.<T3>Commercial Fishing and Salvage Activities.</T3> Four respondents indicatedthat their State regulates commercial fishing near abandoned shipwrecks.However, none prohibits or places restrictions on commercial fishing nearhistoric shipwrecks.Of the 28 respondents that indicated their State regulates commercial salvageof historic shipwrecks, five said that such activity is prohibited. Twenty-twoof the States that regulate commercial salvage of historic shipwrecks placeconditions upon the salvor for the protection of the wreck's historicalvalues. The most frequently cited conditions include requiring the salvorto prepare a research design, use archeological methods, prepare a professionalreport, preserve recovered artifacts and other materials, employ qualifiedunderwater archeologists and marine conservators, and protect the environment.In addition, 12 of the States retain title to all artifacts and materialsrecovered, while 16 other States award a portion to the salvor. Six Stateshave laws or regulations that specify the percentage to be retained bythe State.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The primary authors of these guidelines are Michele C. Aubry (archeologistand program analyst) and James P. Delgado (maritime historian and diver)in the National Park Service, Washington, DC. Patricia C.

Uponasserting title, the United States Government transferred title to themajority of those abandoned shipwrecks to the States to manage. The UnitedStates retained title to abandoned shipwrecks that are located on publiclands while Indian tribes hold title to abandoned shipwrecks that are locatedon Indian lands.The Act encourages the States to carry out their responsibilities underthe Act in a manner that protects natural resources and habitat areas,guarantees recreational exploration of shipwreck sites, and allows forappropriate public and private sector recovery of shipwrecks consistentwith the protection of the site's historical values and environmental integrity.The Act also directed the National Park Service to prepare the guidelinesbeing issued hereinafter to assist the States and Federal agencies in developinglegislation and regulations to carry out their responsibilities under theAct. These ``Abandoned Shipwreck Act Guidelines'' are advisory in nature.The States and Federal agencies are encouraged to use them and other applicablehistoric preservation standards and guidelines for developing, reviewing,revising, and implementing programs to manage abandoned shipwrecks undertheir control or jurisdiction. Other standards and guidelines that wouldapply include the ``Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelinesfor Archeology and Historic Preservation'' (48 FR 44716) and the NationalPark Service's ``Guidelines for Federal Agency Responsibilities Under Section110 of the National Historic Preservation Act'' (53 FR 4727). However,agencies are free to adopt alternative approaches for establishing shipwreckprograms that are consistent with the intent of the Abandoned ShipwreckAct.The ``Abandoned Shipwreck Act Guidelines'' and the philosophy on whichthey are based are the result of three decades of shipwreck managementexperience within units of the National Park System. That experience includessurveying, identifying, evaluating, documenting, interpreting, managing,recovering, and protecting historic shipwrecks. As submerged cultural resources,the Service treats and manages historic shipwrecks in the same manner asit does other classes of cultural resources that are located on land.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The basic steps of shipwreck management are:(a) Locate and identify all shipwrecks;(b) Determine which shipwrecks are abandoned;(c) Determine which shipwrecks are historic;(d) Consult and maintain a cooperative relationship with the various shipwreckinterest groups;(e) Identify the different values that a shipwreck may possess and thewreck's current and potential uses;(f) Provide unrestricted access to sport divers to explore shipwrecks;(g) Preserve significant historic shipwrecks in place and protect themfrom damaging or destructive activities;(h) Provide for public appreciation, understanding, and enjoyment of shipwrecksand maritime history;(i) Conduct archeological research on shipwrecks where research will yieldinformation important to understanding the past;(j) Make provisions for private sector involvement in shipwreck research;(k) Protect the rights of owners of non-abandoned shipwrecks; (1) Make provisions to allow for commercial salvage and other private sectorrecovery of shipwrecks when such activities are in the public interest;(m) Cooperate with other State and Federal agencies and sovereign nationshaving an interest in shipwreck management; and (n) Educate and train the public to better appreciate shipwrecks and participatein shipwreck research projects. The guidelines that follow in this document elaborate upon these basicsteps of shipwreck management. The guidelines are divided into two parts.Part l contains definitions of key terms and Part 11 contains guidelinesfor managing abandoned shipwrecks. <ITAG tagnum="84">Part I. Definitions </ITAG>As used for purposes of these guidelines: An ``Abandoned,'' shipwreck means any shipwreck to which title has beengiven up by the owner with the intent of never claiming a right or interestin the future. Sometimes an owner takes steps to affirmatively abandona shipwreck such as by collecting insurance or by paying a salvage awardto persons that salvage the vessel's cargo. By not taking any action afterthe wreck incident to recover or remove the vessel and its cargo, an ownershows intent to give up title. Such shipwrecks ordinarily are treated asbeing abandoned. Although a shipwreck entitled to sovereign immunity oftenappears to have been abandoned by the flag nation, in fact it remains theproperty of the nation to which it belonged at the time of sinking unlessthat nation has taken formal action to abandon or transfer title. Any cargoaboard a vessel entitled to sovereign immunity also generally remains theproperty of the flag nation, unless the cargo had earlier been unlawfullycaptured by that nation. In such a situation, title to the cargo remainsin the nation from which it had been captured. Shipwrecks entitled to sovereignimmunity are wrecks of vessels used only on Government non-commercial serviceat the time of sinking. Examples would include warships and privately ownedvessels that were chartered or otherwise appropriated by a sovereign formilitary purposes. The ``Act'' means the Abandoned Shipwreck Act (43 U.S.C. 2101). ``Conservation'' means a series of chemical and/or physical processes fortreating artifacts and materials in order to allow their exposure to anon-aqueous environment without degradation. A ``Historic'' shipwreck generally means a shipwreck that is listed inor determined eligible for listing in the National Register of HistoricPlaces. When a shipwreck located in State waters is embedded either inthe seabed or in coralline formations protected by a State, it may be treatedas a historic shipwreck. When a question exists as to the historical significanceof an embedded shipwreck, a request for a determination of eligibilitymay be made to the Secretary of the Interior. When a shipwreck is locatedon a State's submerged lands (i.e., the shipwreck is not embedded in theseabed or in coralline formations protected by a State) it must be listedin or determined eligible for listing in the National Register of HistoricPlaces by the Secretary of the Interior before the United States assertstitle under the Act. Procedures for listing or determining historic propertieseligible for the National Register of Historic Places are found at 36 CFRParts 60 and 63. Currently, there are 109 shipwreck listings in the NationalRegister of Historic Places. A ``Shipwreck'' is defined in the Act to mean ``a vessel or wreck, itscargo, and other contents.'' The vessel or wreck may be intact or brokeninto pieces scattered on or embedded in submerged lands or coralline formations.A vessel or wreck includes, but is not limited to, its hull, rigging, armaments,apparel, tackle, cargo, and other contents. Isolated artifacts and materialsnot in association with a wrecked ship do not fit the definition of a ``shipwreck.''``Submerged lands'' is defined in the Act to mean ``the lands (1) thatare`lands beneath navigable waters,' as defined in section 2 of the SubmergedLands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301); (2) of Puerto Rico, as described in section8 of the Act of March 2, 1917, as amended (48 U.S.C. 749); (3) of Guam,the Virgin Islands and American Samoa, as described in section l of Pub.L. 93-435 (48 U.S.C. 1705); and (4) of the Commonwealth of the NorthernMariana Islands, as described in section 801 of Pub. L. 94-241 (48 U.S.C.1681).'' In general, submerged lands include the bottomlands of navigablerivers and lakes and tidal and offshore marine waters out to three nauticalmiles (see section 2 of the Submerged Lands Act for the precise definition).As noted in the legislative history accompanying the Abandoned ShipwreckAct, the United States asserts sovereignty and title only to certain abandonedshipwrecks in or on submerged lands located within, but not beyond, threenautical miles, notwithstanding the special rights of Texas, Florida, andPuerto Rico in regard to submerged lands beyond that limit. <ITAG tagnum="84">Part II. Guidelines for Managing Abandoned Shipwrecks </ITAG>Guidelines for Establishing a State Shipwreck ProgramAlmost every State, including landlocked ones with navigable rivers andlakes, contains abandoned shipwrecks in its submerged lands. Section 6(c)of the Act transferred title to certain of those shipwrecks in State watersto the respective States. The Act and the legislative history clearly indicatethat the Congress intends to encourage the States to manage abandoned shipwrecksin State waters in a manner that reflects the diverse values and multipleuses of shipwrecks. Those values and uses include, but are not limitedto: (a) Archeological values and uses, which include scientific study of theshipwreck site to extract information that enables reconstruction of pasthuman behavior; (b) Historical values and uses, which include those qualities of shipwrecksthat make them eligible for listing in the National Register of HistoricPlaces; (c) Memorial values and uses, which include vessels that wrecked with lossof life, even if human remains are no longer present or visible; (d) Monetary values and uses, which include public and private profit makingactivities such as generating tourism revenues from increased diving activity,publishing popular books, making movies, and salvaging valuable cargoes;(e) Recreational values and uses, which include public use and enjoymentthrough such activities as scuba diving, snorkeling, spearfishing, andunderwater photography; and (f) Symbolic values and uses, which include shipwrecks whose careers orwreck events are extraordinarily significant to the nation's history andare reflected in the nation's literature, art, music, religious philosophy,or politics.The following guidelines are offered to assist States in establishing programsto manage abandoned shipwrecks. States that have existing shipwreck programswill find these guidelines useful when reviewing current programs and determiningif any legislative, policy or procedural changes should be made. <T3>Guideline 1: Involve interest groups.</T3> States should hold publicmeetings and consult often with the various interest groups for suggestionson developing, revising, and implementing shipwreck program legislation,regulations, policies, and procedures. Groups that should be consultedinclude dive clubs, diving instructors, sport divers, dive boat operators,dive shops, fishermen, marina operators, underwater archeologists, maritimehistorians, nautical conservators, historic preservationists, salvors,marine biologists, and natural resource specialists. State and Federalagencies with related program interests also should be involved. Agencieswith related program interests would include those responsible for parks,recreation, navigation, tourism, museums, submerged lands and natural resources,cultural resources, and fishing. <T3>Guideline 2: Assign responsibility for historic shipwrecks to a historicpreservation agency. </T3>States should assign responsibility for the managementand protection of abandoned historic shipwrecks to an agency experiencedin cultural resources management and historic preservation matters, suchas the State Historic Preservation Officer or the State Archeologist. Theagency should be charged with responsibility for developing and implementinga long-term plan for surveying, inventorying, evaluating, interpreting,and preserving historic shipwrecks located in State waters. The plan shouldestablish multiyear objectives and schedules which can be used by the agencyto develop annual operating plans to carry out its responsibilities.<T3>Guideline 3: Provide adequate staff, facilities, and equipment. </T3>Theagency assigned responsibility for the management and protection of abandonedhistoric shipwrecks in State waters should have (or have access to) adequateprofessional staff, office and laboratory facilities, and diving and underwatersurvey equipment to carry out its responsibilities. The number of staff,facilities, and equipment will vary according to the needs and goals ofeach State. For example, an agency that plans to conduct its own surveysand inventories, or operate its own maritime museum, would require moreprofessional and technical staff, equipment, and facilities than wouldan agency that plans to contract for such professional services.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The following questions should be answered to help determine appropriatestaffing and funding levels: (a) What is the total acreage of submerged lands in the State? (b) How many abandoned shipwrecks are known to be present in State waters,and how many are estimated to exist? (c) What is the amount of sport diving activity at shipwreck sites in Statewaters, and does the State promote or plan to promote such recreationalactivities? (d) How many underwater parks and preserves exist or are planned, and whatrecreational and educational facilities are present or planned? (e) What is the amount of historical and archeological research and commercialsalvage activity at shipwreck sites in State waters, and what kind of programto regulate such activities does the State have or plan? (f) How does the State plan to conduct inventories to identify and evaluateshipwreck sites in State waters (e.g., use its own staff, equipment andfacilities; oversee contractors; systematically train and work with volunteers;or rely on sport divers, researchers, salvors, and fishermen on an ad hocbasis)? (g) How does the State plan to conserve and subsequently exhibit artifactsand materials recovered from shipwreck sites (e.g., use its own staff,equipment and facilities; oversee contractors; rely on sport divers, researchers,and salvors; or loan items to local museums and other repositories)? (h) What kind of educational, interpretive, publication, and general publicawareness programs does the State have or plan? <T3>Gudeline 4: Cooperate with State and Federal agencies. </T3>For a shipwreckprogram to be effective, the agency assigned management responsibilityfor abandoned shipwrecks should cooperate and work closely on a routinebasis with other State and Federal agencies that have submerged lands relatedresponsibilities, including the: (a) State's park authority to designate and operate State underwater parksor preserves, and develop appropriate interpretive, recreational and educationalprograms; (b) State's museum to conserve, store, study, and exhibit artifacts andother materials recovered from abandoned shipwrecks; (c) State's submerged lands, natural resources, and marine fisheries agenciesto ensure that: (1) Shipwreck activities do not have an adverse affect on natural areas,geological formations and habitat areas, particularly coralline formationsand other marine resources protected by the State; and (2) Activities related to managing submerged lands, natural resources,and marine life do not have an adverse affect on historic shipwrecks; (d) State's coastal zone management office to inventory and designate abandonedhistoric shipwrecks as ``areas of particular concern,'' and ensure thatshipwrecks so designated are protected from development of land and waterresources in the coastal zone in accordance with the State's coastal zonemanagement program pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act (16 U.S.C.1451 <T3>et seq.</T3>); (e) State's law enforcement agency and attorney general's office to protectshipwrecks in State waters that the State holds title to; (f) United States Army Corps of Engineers and the United States Coast Guardto ensure that: (1) Shipwreck survey, inventory, documentation, recovery, and protectionactivities do not pose navigational hazards; and (2) Activities related to the Army Corps of Engineers' dredging, construction,and permitting programs do not have an adverse affect on historic shipwrecks;(g) Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and appropriate Federal agenciesto coordinate any necessary compliance with section 106 of the NationalHistoric Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470) related to a Federal, federallyfunded or federally licensed undertaking; (h) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which designates andmanages nationally significant shipwrecks located within National MarineSanctuaries, some of which are held in State ownership; and (i) National Park Service, which manages and protects shipwrecks locatedwithin units of the National Park System, some of which are held in Stateownership. <T3>Guideline 5: Establish a shipwreck advisory board. </T3>States shouldestablish a shipwreck program advisory board to develop and foster a continuingpartnership among the various interest groups. As appropriate to the needsof each State, advisory board members should include a sport diver, a diveinstructor, a dive boat operator, a commercial fisherman, a commercialsalvor, a maritime historian, an underwater archeologist, a nautical conservator,a marine biologist, and representatives from appropriate State agencies.Duties of the advisory board should include making recommendations to theState on: (a) Promulgation of shipwreck program regulations and policies; (b) Establishment of a permit program for the archeological recovery ofabandoned historic shipwrecks; (c) Establishment of a permit program for the commercial salvage of abandonedshipwrecks; (d) Establishment of underwater parks and preserves, and other protection,interpretation, and education programs; and (e) Periodic review and monitoring of program operations. <T3>Guideline 6: Prosecute persons who violate the program. </T3>Statesshould ensure that they have the authority to prosecute persons who willfullydamage or vandalize abandoned shipwreck sites located in underwater parksor preserves, or recover artifacts and materials from abandoned historicshipwrecks without the necessary permits. Criminal fines and civil penaltiesfor violating provisions of the State's shipwreck program should be commensuratewith the nature of the violation, and should include community servicein the preservation of historic shipwrecks. Fines and penalties for secondand subsequent violations should be more stringent than those for the firstviolation. Information on restrictions, fines, and penalties should bedistributed to affected interest groups and posted on or near shipwrecksites. Artifacts and other materials recovered illegally from abandonedhistoric shipwrecks should be confiscated, conserved and preserved by theState. Fines and penalties collected should be used to: (a) Restore damaged wreck sites and their immediate environment; (b) Conserve and preserve confiscated artifacts and other materials; (c) Further the efforts of shipwreck research and protection; and (d) Enhance the public's appreciation of historic shipwrecks.<T3>Guideline 7: Authorize acceptance of donations and cooperative agreements.</T3>For purposes of locating, evaluating, managing, interpreting, andprotecting abandoned historic shipwrecks, States should ensure that theyhave the authority to: (a) Accept donations of funds, personal property, or services from otherparties; and (b) Enter into cooperative agreements with scientific and educational institutions.<T3>Guideline 8: Establish a procedure for confirming the abandonment ofshipwrecks. </T3>If a State has reason to believe that a shipwreck sitelocated in its waters may not be abandoned, prior to taking any actionthat would affect the shipwreck the State should take steps to confirmthat the shipwreck was abandoned and that the State now holds title tothe wreck. If the shipwreck is thought to be a United States warship orother vessel used at the time of sinking only on United States Governmentnon-commercial service, the State should contact the Office of the JudgeAdvocate General in the United States Department of the Navy for assistance.If the shipwreck is thought to be a warship belonging to another sovereignnation, or other vessel used at the time of sinking by another sovereignnation only on non-commercial service, the State should contact the Bureauof Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs in theUnited States Department of State for assistance. If the shipwreck is notabandoned, the State should contact the title holder concerning the management,protection and disposition of the vessel. If the shipwreck is the propertyof another sovereign nation, any contact with that nation should be throughthe United States Department of State. <T3>Guideline 9: Establish a procedure for treating human remains in shipwrecksites. </T3>Where a shipwreck site contains human remains, the State agencyhaving jurisdiction should make a reasonable effort to contact relativesof the deceased to discuss the most appropriate treatment of the remains.Until the agency makes a decision regarding disposition, it should refrainfrom taking an action that would disturb the remains. All remains shouldbe treated with dignity and respect. <T3>Guideline 10: Establish a procedure for reviewing and commenting onState and Federal activities that may adversely affect historic shiipwrecks.</T3>The State agency assigned responsibility for the management and protectionof abandoned historic shipwrecks should ensure that it has an opportunityto review and comment on State and Federal activities (including funded,licensed and permitted activities) that may disturb, alter, damage, ordestroy historic shipwreck sites in State waters. Any disturbance shouldbe allowed only with appropriate archeological mitigation. <T3>Guideline 11: Use applicable historic preservation standards and criteria.</T3>The State agency assigned responsibility for the management and protectionof abandoned historic shipwrecks should ensure that applicable historicpreservation standards and criteria are used in the operation of the State'sshipwreck program. For example, the ``Secretary of the Interior's Standardsand Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation'' (48 FR 44716)provide advice on a wide range of archeological and historic preservationactivities, including planning, survey, evaluation, registration, preservation,and documentation. Copies of the ``Secretary's Standards and Guidelines,''issued on September 29, 1983, may be obtained from the Interagency ResourcesDivision of the National Park Service, P.O. Box 37127, Washington, DC 20013-7127.Similarly, the National Register's criteria for evaluation, contained in36 CFR Part 60, should be used to evaluate the historical significanceof abandoned shipwrecks. Guidelines for Funding Adequate funding is the key for the successful operation of State and Federalagency programs for the management and protection of abandoned shipwrecksunder their respective control or jurisdiction. Without sufficient funding,an agency would have difficulty carrying out its responsibilities underthe Act and other Federal and State historic preservation statutes andregulations. These responsibilities include the survey, inventory, evaluation,documentation, and protection of historic shipwrecks sites. It also includesthe conservation, storage, study, and exhibition of artifacts and othermaterials recovered from historic shipwreck sites. Expenses associatedwith the management and protection of abandoned historic shipwrecks canbe high, given the costs of conducting scientific research underwater andconserving materials recovered from an underwater environment. But, theresults of such research and conservation efforts also can generate substantialrevenues through increased tourism. The best example is in Sweden, whichraised and conserved the 17th century warship the <T3>Vasa</T3>. Revenues generated annually into the Swedish economy aresaid to be $275 million. The following guidelines are offered to assist the States and Federal agenciesin securing and allocating funds, and generating revenues for carryingout their responsibilities to manage and protect abandoned historic shipwrecks.<T3>Guideline 1: Fund the shipwreck program from annual appropriations.</T3>State and Federal agency offices charged with the responsibility formanaging and protecting abandoned shipwrecks under the agency's jurisdictionshould be funded from annual appropriations. Separate appropriation requestsshould be made to conduct special studies at a particular shipwreck site,or to study an area for possible designation as an underwater park or preserve.If approved by the legislature, a commitment should be made to fund thestudy to completion. For example, if a State legislature approves a specialrequest to excavate an historically significant shipwreck, sufficient moniesshould be made available not only for the excavation, but for the laboratoryanalysis, conservation treatments, storage in an appropriate repository,report preparation, and public interpretation as well. Because such studiesordinarily are completed over the course of several years, agencies shouldprovide multiyear estimates prior to initiating studies. <T3>Guideline 2: Fund projects from the Historic Preservation Fund. </T3>Section4(b) of the Act directs the States to make Historic Preservation Fund (HPF)monies available, in accordance with Title 1 of the National Historic PreservationAct (16 U.S.C. 470), for the study, interpretation, protection, and preservationof historic shipwrecks and properties. HPF grants are available only afterappropriation and thus may or may not be available. If and when HPF grantsare made to the States without restrictions to the contrary, States shouldinclude historic shipwrecks within the scope of their program of eligibleactivities. In particular, historic shipwrecks should be included in theState's inventory of historic properties and the State's comprehensivehistoric preservation plan. This will enable the State to more effectivelyidentify management needs, set priorities, undertake archival research,survey, inventory, evaluate, document, interpret, and protect historicshipwrecks located in State waters. <T3>Guideline 3: Fund projects using Coastal Zone Management grants. </T3>TheNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States Departmentof Commerce has identified section 306 of the Coastal Zone Management Act(16 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.) as a funding authority to assist States in developingand implementing shipwreck management programs. Subject to annual appropriationby the United States Congress, without restrictions to the contrary, CoastalZone Management (CZM) grant monies may be made available under section306A(b) of that Act for:(a) Preserving or restoring specific areas that are designated under theState's coastal zone management program because of their conservation,recreational, ecological or esthetic values, or because of their nationalsignificance;(b) Redeveloping deteriorating and underutilized urban waterfronts andports that are designated under the State's coastal zone management programas ``areas of particular concern;'' and(c) Providing increased access to public beaches, coastal waters and othercoastal areas.Section 306 CZM grants could be of tremendous value to States as sourcesof funding for managing and protecting abandoned shipwrecks. For example,when developing an underwater park, grant monies might be used to identifyand designate historic shipwrecks in the park as ``areas of particularconcern;'' rehabilitate piers and replace pilings for increased publicaccess and recreational use; install bulkheads for increased public safety;and develop educational and interpretive materials.<T3>Guideline 4: Apply for other public and private grants.</T3> Subjectto annual appropriations by the United States Congress for such purposes,other public monies may be available for shipwreck projects. For example,the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities,and the National Trust for Historic Preservation may have funds availablefor such purposes. Other sovereign nations may be willing to participatein projects to study shipwrecks connected with their maritime heritage.Public investors and corporate and private sponsors also may be willingto underwrite shipwreck projects in exchange for media rights or advertising.<T3>Guideline 5: Use other appropriate Federal funding authorities.</T3>The National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470) and the Archeologicaland Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 469-469c) identify several methodsfor Federal agencies to fund studies to identify, evaluate, and recoverdata from historic shipwreck sites that may be affected by a Federal undertakingor a federally assisted, licensed or permitted project or program. Subjectto annual appropriations by the United States Congress for such purposes,Federal agencies may generally:(a) Include costs for conducting underwater surveys and identifying andevaluating shipwreck sites in planning budgets;(b) Include costs for excavating an historic shipwreck and preserving recoveredartifacts and materials and associated records in mitigation budgets;(c) For federally assisted projects, reimburse grantees for costs incurredconducting preservation activities as a part of the grant project;(d) For federally licensed or permitted projects, charge reasonable costsfor preservation activities to Federal licensees and permittees as a conditionto the issuance of the license or permit; and(e) For Federal projects and programs carried out by a State on behalfof the Federal agency, reimburse the State for costs incurred conductingpreservation activities.<T3>Guideline 6: Encourage volunteers to participate in projects.</T3>Dive clubs and individual sport divers frequently are willing to volunteertheir diving skills and personal equipment to public agencies to help locate,evaluate, map, and preserve shipwrecks. For example, sport divers assistedpublic agencies in surveying and excavating the <T3>Noquebay</T3> an 1890s schooner at Apostle Islands National Lakeshore,and the <T3>Stamboul,</T3> an 1843 built whaling bark near Benicia, California.One of the most well known international examples is the assistance providedby the British Sub-Aqua Club on Henry VIII's flagship the<T3> Mary Rose.</T3> Agencies should encourage sport divers trained inarcheological techniques to participate in professionally supervised surveys,test excavations, shipwreck mapping projects, and other shipwreck preservationactivities. If volunteers participate in projects funded in part by Federalgrants, the monetary value of the volunteer services may be used undercertain Federal grant programs as a match for Federal funds.<T3>Guideline 7: Coordinate efforts with State and Federal agencies.</T3>State and Federal agencies having jurisdiction over contiguous submergedlands should enter into written agreements to coordinate their effortsto conduct archival research, surveys and inventories. Jointly conductingstudies at a regional level will save money and manpower, reduce duplicationof effort, and result in a more complete and extensive assessment of knownand potential abandoned shipwrecks in the areas studied.<T3>Guideline 8: Contact other agencies and nations that may have an interest.</T3>Where a particular shipwreck may be of historical interest to another Stateor Federal agency, or other sovereign nation, the agency having jurisdictionshould contact that agency or nation concerning their participation inarcheological studies. Agencies should not conduct studies on vessels entitledto sovereign immunity without the permission of the sovereign claimingtitle. Any contact between an agency and the sovereign should be throughthe Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairsin the United States Department of State, Washington, DC 20520.<T3>Guideline 9: Complete projects.</T3> State and Federal agencies shouldnot undertake projects or issue permits to excavate or salvage historicshipwrecks unless the:(a) Agency has the funds to properly conserve, store, study, report on,and exhibit the recovered artifacts and materials, and associated records;or(b) Archeological permit applicant or salvor has agreed to provide thoseservices, in perpetuity, on behalf of the agency; or(c) If a portion of the recovered artifacts and materials are awarded tothe salvor, the agency has the funds to provide those services for itsportion of the collection and the salvor has agreed to provide those servicesfor that portion of the collection awarded to the salvor.Guidelines for Survey and InventorySection 6(b) of the Act requires that adequate notice be provided to thepublic of any shipwreck to which title is asserted under the Act. Statesand Federal agencies should, therefore, work to develop a detailed understandingof the extent, nature, and location of all shipwrecks on their submergedlands to which the Act asserted title. Such an understanding is possibleonly through survey of the State's submerged lands and an inventory ofshipwrecks. The following guidelines are offered to assist States in surveyingfor and inventorying shipwrecks.<T3>Guideline 1: Prepare an archeological assessment of the survey area.</T3>Prior to beginning survey work, a professional maritime historian shouldassess the potential for and predict the locations of shipwrecks that maybe present in the survey area. Assessments should be based on availableprimary and secondary sources on shipwrecks, including wrecked vesselsthat were salvaged or refloated. Assessments should also include informationsolicited from fishermen, divers, and other knowledgeable individuals.Assessments should identify geomorphological and climatological factorsand historic events such as military engagements or natural disasters whichmay have caused vessels to founder or wreck. If individual wreck sitesare known, the assessment should summarize the vessel's structural features,career, the wreck incident, and any recovery or salvage. The assessmentshould indicate whether the wreck had been located by salvors, archeologists,fishermen, or sport divers. The approximate or known, verified locationof the wreck should be plotted on navigational charts to determine areasthat should be surveyed.<T3>Guideline 2: Prioritize surveys.</T3> Surveys should primarily focuson areas where shipwrecks are known or expected to be found. In addition,priority should be given to surveying areas subject to high visitor use,dredging, dumping, and other activities that may damage shipwrecks. Ifthe assessment indicates that no wrecks are known or expected to have occurredin a given area, the area should be assigned a low priority for surveyuntil new information indicates otherwise.<T3>Guideline 3: Coordinate surveys.</T3> To the extent possible, surveysshould be coordinated with other surveys being undertaken by other Stateand Federal agencies. The results of surveys should be shared with otherState and Federal agencies having responsibilities for submerged landsand abandoned shipwrecks. At a minimum, surveys should be coordinated withand results provided to the State Historic Preservation Officer and theState Archeologist for inclusion in the State's historic properties inventory.<T3>Guideline 4: Use scientific survey methods and techniques.</T3> Surveysshould employ scientific survey methods and techniques. Magnetometers,side-scan sonar, subbottom profilers, and remote operated vehicles oftenprovide cost effective coverage for deep water sites. Surveys should beconducted systematically, with sufficiently close lane spacing to provideaccurate, detailed coverage of an area. Surveys should be conducted bya team that includes, as a minimum, persons trained in the use of remotesensing equipment and professional archeologists to examine and analyzereadings. All tapes and equipment readings, as well as field notebooksand logs generated during surveys should be collated and archivally savedfor future study. Reports detailing areas surveyed, survey methods, andresults should be prepared and published.<T3>Guideline 5: Record shipwreck locations. </T3>Areas surveyed shouldbe recorded using accurate positioning systems to determine wreck locations.The location of each shipwreck located during the survey should be recordedon a map by using a standard coordinate system such as Universal TransverseMercator grid, Loran C, latitude and longitude, and visual sightings. <T3>Guideline 6: Ground-truth shipwrecks and anomalies. </T3>All shipwrecksand unverified anomalies located in a remote sensing survey should be ground-truthedby either remote operated vehicle or divers to be evaluated. Evaluationsshould include assessments by professional archeologists and historians.<T3>Guideline 7: Prepare a shipwreck inventory. </T3>An inventory of allknown, surveyed shipwreck sites should be prepared and maintained. Eachhistoric shipwreck site should be assigned a trinomial archeological sitenumber. At a minimum, the inventory should contain the wreck's popularname, site number, location, owner, brief description of its historicalsignificance, and whether it is listed in or eligible for listing in theNational Register of Historic Places or a State registry. Documents suchas field notes, historic information, photographs, reports, and site mapsrelating to each shipwreck in the inventory should be maintained. Agenciesare encouraged to use the National Park Service's National Maritime InitiativeInventory format as a model. Guidelines for Evaluation Section 5(a) of the Act requires that these guidelines seek to maximizethe enhancement of cultural resources and recognize the interests of individualsand groups interested in shipwreck discovery and salvage. As shipwrecksare discovered, each shipwreck should be evaluated to determine whetherit is historic or non-historic. <T3>Guideline 1: Use data collected during archival research and fieldsurveys. </T3>Evaluations ordinarily require information collected duringarchival research and field survey of the wreck. Surveys should documentthe wreck through maps, drawings, video, film, or photographs, determinethe extent of associated scattered wreckage, locate any human remains,and ascertain the nature and extent of surviving cargo. The type, age,and if possible, specific identity of the vessel should be determined.Shipwreck evaluation teams should include professional archeologists, historians,marine biologists, recreational planners, sport divers, and others as determinedby the analysis of survey and inventory data. <T3>Guideline 2: Use non-destructive methods. </T3>Shipwrecks should beevaluated in as non-destructive and non-disturbing a manner as possible.If possible, evaluations should be made without removing shipwreck materialsor artifacts. If materials must be removed, such as when the wreck siteis encrusted, the amount of materials removed should be as limited as possibleto make evaluations, and done using archeological methods. This is particularlyimportant in cases where historic or archeological value is suspected.<T3>Guideline 3: Professionals and interest groups should be involved.</T3>Evaluation of a shipwreck's historic and non-historic values shouldinclude review and comment by interested professional, avocational, andother interest groups, appropriate State and Federal agencies, and theState's shipwreck advisory board, if one exists. <T3>Guideline 4: Nominate historic shipwrecks to historic registers. </T3>Ifit appears that the wreck is historic, sufficient information should begathered to nominate the wreck to the National Register of Historic Placesand any State registers. Historic shipwrecks of exceptional national significanceshould be nominated for designation as a National Historic Landmark. Nominationsshould be subject to professional and public review by the various interestgroups prior to submission to the State Historic Preservation Officer and/orthe Keeper of the National Register. National Register Bulletin Number20 entitled ``Nominating Historic Vessels and Shipwrecks to the NationalRegister of Historic Places'' provides advice on preparing National Registernomination forms. Gudelines for Documentation Documenting historic shipwrecks during surveys aids in evaluation and interpretationefforts. Documenting a shipwreck also provides important baseline informationfor managing and protecting the site. Once a shipwreck has been documented,it is then possible to assess changes to the wreck site over time. Thesechanges may result from vandalism, water currents, water pollution, anchordamage, or attrition from intensive diver use. If comparing a wreck's currentcondition to its original documentation shows significant change or damage,then steps can be taken to rectify the situation. <T3>Guideline 1: Document historic shipwrecks. </T3>At a minimum, historicshipwrecks should be mapped and photographed. Drawings should be made ofunique, representative, and significant features. Information on the vessel'shistory also should be compiled. <T3>Guideline 2: Use Historic American Engineering Record standards. </T3>Drawingsof wrecks, particularly intact vessels, should conform, when possible,to the Historic American Engineering Record's ``Standards for DocumentingHistoric Vessels.'' <T3>Guideline 3: Take photographs. </T3>Photographs of wrecks should includeboth black and white photographs and color slides of the wreck, artifacts,and important features. Historic photographs of the vessel when afloatand of the actual wreck event should be included if they exist. All photographsshould be clearly labeled. <T3>Guideline 4: Make a video. </T3>If possible, a video survey shouldbe made. Video surveys should be oriented to a map of the wreck that showsthe passes over or through the wreck site. Several passes should be madeto provide as comprehensive a video tour of the wreck as possible. Detailedvideo footage should be made of noteworthy, fragile, or dangerous features.<T3>Guideline 5: Map sites. </T3>Archeological site maps should be preparedfor historic shipwrecks. By accurately plotting individual artifacts onthe site map, agencies can measure attrition of artifacts over time. <T3>Guideline 6: Maintain documentation in one location. </T3>All documentationof a shipwreck site should remain together in a central repository withsurvey records, reports, and inventory forms. For safety reasons, duplicatesshould be made and retained in a separate location. <T3>Guideline 7: Make documentation accessible to interested parties. </T3>Shipwreckdocumentation should be made accessible to the public for interpretationand appreciation. Specific documentation for interpretive purposes shouldbe undertaken. Documentation of historic shipwrecks, particularly drawingsand plans, should be published. However, prior to releasing site locationalinformation, States and Federal agencies should assess the risk of theftor vandalism. Maps and associated documentation containing precise locationalinformation should be considered privileged information if its disclosurewould create a risk of harm to the wreck site. Conversely, agencies shouldrelease locational information on wreck sites to which visitation is encouraged.Guidelines for Public Access Section 4(a) of the Act says that the Congress intends for the States toprovide reasonable access to the public to abandoned shipwrecks, and guaranteerecreational exploration of shipwreck sites. Access by the public is beneficialfor tourism, recreation, public enjoyment and appreciation, and preservation.The following guidelines are offered to assist States and Federal agenciesin determining reasonable access. <T3>Guideline 1: Consult with interest groups. </T3>Agencies should consultwith the various interest groups, the State Historic Preservation Officer,the State Archeologist, and pertinent State and Federal agencies priorto imposing any restrictions on access to abandoned shipwrecks under theagency's jurisdiction. Decisions to restrict access should be made on acase by case basis and only after considering public comments and the valuesand uses of the particular shipwreck. Restrictions should be practicaland fairly administered to the different interest groups. <T3>Guideline 2: Provide public notice of restrictions. </T3>Once a decisionhas been made to restrict access, the public should be provided noticeof the restrictions. Public notice might include but not be limited tonotation of protected or restricted shipwrecks on navigation charts, postingnotices on the wreck site and at marinas and dive shops, and notifyingcharter boat operators. <T3>Guideline 3: Provide access to historic shipwreck sites. </T3>Any personshould be able to freely inspect, study, explore, photograph, measure,record, or otherwise use and enjoy an historic shipwreck in State or Federalwaters if the use or activity does not involve damaging or removing partsor portions of the shipwreck or its immediate environment.<T3>Guideline 4: Restrict access to few, if any, historic shipwrecks. </T3>Accessshould be restricted at historic shipwrecks that are: (a) Extremely fragile or suffering deterioration or attrition due to unrestrictedaccess; or (b) Being studied or salvaged under a valid archeological or salvage permit.<T3>Guideline 5: Encourage access to shipwrecks in parks and preserves.</T3>States should consider establishing underwater parks and preservesto protect historic shipwrecks that are unique, well preserved, and valuablefor recreation purposes. Public facilities to support diver access andvisitor appreciation should be provided in these parks and preserves, asappropriate (see the Guidelines for Establishing Underwater Parks and Preserves).<T3>Guideline 6: Establish lists of shipwrecks having recreational value.</T3>A listing of shipwrecks having recreational value in the State shouldbe prepared in cooperation with sport divers, charter boat operators, historians,archeologists, fishermen, scuba associations, certification bodies, anddive clubs. This listing should include a map with LORAN coordinates, listdepth and general bottom conditions, and provide an appraisal of diverskill necessary to visit each wreck. In addition, sport diver access towreck sites having recreational value should be facilitated through placementof marker buoys and anchor moorings. Guidelines for Interpretation Section 5(a) of the Act requires that these guidelines seek to maximizethe enhancement of cultural resources. Section 4(2)(b) also states thatfunds shall be made available for various reasons including interpretation.Interpretation of shipwreck history and values helps the public betterunderstand and appreciate shipwrecks, and is the only means for impartingto the public the historical information and archeological discoveriesthat result from shipwreck research. The following guidelines are offeredfor the interpretation of historic shipwrecks. <T3>Guideline 1: Interpret publicly owned shipwrecks. </T3>Consistent withan agency's primary mission, interpretation and public education programsshould be a component of any State or Federal agency's management planfor historic shipwrecks. <T3>Guideline 2: Interpret shipwrecks for all interest groups. </T3>Shipwreckinterpretation should reach as broad an audience as possible. Interpretivematerials on shipwreck sites and maritime history should be prepared fordivers and non-divers of all age groups. <T3>Guideline 3: Use the printed media to disseminate shipwreck researchresults. </T3>The results of shipwreck research should be presented inprofessional reports as well as non-technical popular publications suchas magazines, books (including children's books), brochures, exhibits,videos, and slide shows. <T3>Guideline 4: Use museums to disseminate information and educate thepublic. </T3>Museums and visitor centers which interpret local, regional,or national maritime history should interpret and educate the public throughexhibits, videos, slide shows, and lectures on shipwrecks, maritime history,and underwater archeology. <T3>Guideline 5: Provide lectures and temporary exhibits. </T3>Public presentationsand temporary exhibits on maritime history, underwater archeology, diving,underwater photography, and marine resources found at wreck sites shouldbe made available to libraries, dive clubs, dive shops, boat and dive shows,marinas, historical societies, community colleges, local museums, and otherappropriate outlets. <T3>Guideline 6: Build models of vessels. </T3>Models of intact, historicallysignificant shipwrecks should be made to provide detailed, small-scaleorientation and interpretation for divers and non-divers. Models wouldbe particularly useful when diving is difficult or restricted (such asUSS <T3>Arizona</T3>) or when sufficient public interest in the shipwreck exists(such as the USS <T3>Monitor</T3>). The process of building models also can be a popularand successful interpretive activity. <T3>Guideline 7: Include interpretive materials in parks and preserves.</T3>Underwater parks or preserves and underwater shipwreck trails canbe used to effectively interpret shipwreck sites for divers. Trails andwreck sites should be marked with permanent signs. In addition, a sitemap and brochure, enclosed in mylar and small enough to fit into a buoyancycompensator pocket, could be prepared for individual wreck sites. <T3>Guideline 8: Discourage the recovery and display of intact shipwrecks.</T3>Recovering whole historic shipwrecks for display and interpretationon land is discouraged. The costs for raising, conserving, and maintaininga shipwreck are prohibitively expensive and never ending. Agencies shouldconsider recovering only extremely significant or endangered historic shipwrecks.However, no shipwreck should be recovered unless sufficient funds are madeavailable to document and recover it archeologically and to conserve, maintain,and interpret it for the public. Guidelines for Education Section 5(a)(1) of the Act states that the guidelines shall seek to maximizethe enhancement of cultural resources. Sport divers, salvors, fishermen,archeologists, and others are interested in discovering, exploring, studying,protecting, and recovering shipwrecks. The following guidelines are offeredto assist States and Federal agencies in encouraging and promoting bothpublic and private sector programs to educate the various interest groupsin the preservation of historic shipwrecks. <T3>Guideline 1: Use existing training programs. </T3>Many professionaldiving organizations and other educational and scientific organizationsoffer certificate programs and courses to train divers in shipwreck divingand basic underwater archeological skills. States and Federal agenciesshould contact those organizations to ensure that: (a) Shipwreck diving courses teach divers non-destructive, preservationoriented behavior; and (b) Professional underwater archeologists and maritime historians are involvedin teaching underwater archeology courses. Agencies also might work with those organizations to produce a manual forvolunteers consisting of information from the training courses. <T3>Guideline 2: Encourage development of training programs by the privatesector. </T3>In States where shipwreck diving and underwater archeologycourses are not available for sport divers, States and Federal agenciesshould contact professional diving organizations and other appropriateeducational and scientific organizations to encourage them to develop andoffer such courses. The knowledge and skills of historical, archeologicaland education professionals should be utilized in preparing curricula.<T3>Guideline 3: Train sport divers in basic archeological methods. </T3>Underwaterarcheology courses designed for sport divers should provide basic trainingin scientific methods to research, locate, record, and report shipwrecks.At a minimum, course content should include background in archival research,survey methods, site mapping, illustration, diagnostic measurement skills,standard vessel architecture, artifact identification and conservation,ethics, and responsibilities under State and Federal laws and internationaltreaties. Advanced courses could provide training in excavation techniquesand nomination of historically significant shipwrecks to the National Registerof Historic Places. These kinds of training courses will greatly assistsport divers who wish to assist State and Federal agencies and professionalunderwater archeologists conducting shipwreck projects. <T3>Guideline 4: Establish an information sharing network. </T3>Statesshould establish an information sharing network among archeological organizationsand professionals, dive clubs and associations, educational institutions,and other interested persons to distribute information on underwater archeologicalresource projects. <T3>Guideline 5: Encourage scientific and educational organizations toparticipate in shipwreck projects. </T3>States and Federal agencies shouldcontact universities, colleges, and other scientific or educational organizationsthat offer professional underwater archeology degree programs or courses,and encourage them to participate in shipwreck research projects. For example,projects could be used as field schools for training students or as researchsites for student's theses or dissertations. Guidelines for Volunteer Programs Section 5(a)(2) of the Act states the guidelines shall seek to foster apartnership among sport divers, fishermen, archeologists, salvors, andother interests to manage shipwreck resources. Such a partnership couldbe developed and nurtured through well organized, well supervised volunteerprograms. With proper training and qualified supervision, volunteers arean effective, efficient, and economical resource for shipwreck management.The following guidelines are offered to assist States and Federal agenciesin establishing volunteer programs.<T3>Guideline 1: Use volunteers in historic shipwreck research projects.</T3>States and Federal agencies should encourage both sport diver andnon-diver volunteers to help agencies conduct archival research and surveysto locate historic shipwreck sites, and map, photograph, excavate and protecthistoric shipwreck sites. <T3>Guideline 2: Ensure that volunteers are properly trained and supervised.</T3>At a minimum, sport diver volunteers should be certified in SCUBA and allvolunteers should be under the supervision of qualified professionals.Advanced SCUBA certification and specialty courses such as wreck diving,search and recovery, underwater photography and underwater archeology shouldbe encouraged to improve diving skills needed for diving sensitive wrecks(see Guidelines for Education for recommended underwater archeology coursecurriculum). In evaluating a volunteer's skills, agencies should recognizeavocational experience and training courses completed out-of-State. <T3>Guideline 3: Maintain lists of volunteers.</T3> States and Federalagencies should maintain a list of sport divers who have completed underwaterarcheology training courses as well as other persons who have shown aninterest in volunteering as a source of volunteers for shipwreck surveyand research projects. <T3>Guideline 4: Establish a liaison with interest groups.</T3> Statesand Federal agencies should establish a liaison to help advise and organizevolunteers within the State. The existing network of dive associations,clubs, and shops could be used to disseminate information to interesteddivers. <T3>Guideline 5: Recognize the contributions of volunteers.</T3> Individualvolunteers and volunteer societies should be recognized for their contributionsto shipwreck discovery, research, and preservation. Some forms of recognitioncould include: (a) Naming shipwreck sites after the person who discovered it; (b) Issuing certificates or plaques to persons and organizations that discovershipwreck sites or worked as volunteers on shipwreck research projects;(c) Naming volunteers and discoverers in museum exhibits, newspaper andmagazine coverage, and publications; and (d) Offering qualified individuals who discover a shipwreck first optionto apply for an archeological permit to study the site or a salvage permitto recover the shipwreck. <T3>Guidelines for Establishing Underwater Parks and Preserves</T3> Section 4(b) of the Act encourages States to establish underwater parksor areas to provide additional protection for shipwreck sites. Other positiveresults of creating underwater parks or areas would be to (1) increasethe public's awareness and appreciation for the nation's maritime heritage,(2) provide additional recreational opportunities for sport divers, and(3) provide additional protection for natural resources and habitat areas.The following guidelines are offered to assist States in establishing underwaterparks and preserves. <T3>Guideline 1: Consult with the various interest groups.</T3> Statesshould hold public meetings and consult with the various interest groups(sport divers, dive boat operators, dive shops, fishermen, archeologists,historic preservationists, local chambers of commerce, local and regionalrecreation and tourism organizations, pertinent State and Federal agencies,and others) for suggestions on establishing and operating underwater parksand preserves. <T3>Guideline 2: Prepare an environmental and economic impact assessment.</T3>Prior to establishing an underwater park or preserve, States should preparean assessment of the environmental and economic impacts that would result.Assessments should include discussion of natural and cultural resourcespresent and their current uses; potential recreational, educational, preservationand tourism benefits; and potential costs for park or preserve operations.Draft assessments should be made available to the State's shipwreck advisoryboard, if one exists, and the various interest groups for public reviewand comment. <T3>Guideline 3: Specify the unit's purpose, significance, boundaries,and any special conditions and constraints.</T3> Legislation or regulationsauthorizing an underwater park or preserve should establish the unit'spurpose and significance, specify its boundaries, and identify any specialconditions and constraints. If the unit is to be managed by a Federal agencyon behalf of a State, the enabling legislation or management agreementshould clearly indicate that the unit's resources are to be managed accordingto the Federal agency's policies and procedures for managing similar federally-ownedparks or preserves. If the enabling legislation or management agreementfor existing federally managed submerged lands of a State does not addressthis issue, the State and the Federal agency should enter into a writtenagreement which specifies that the Federal agency shall manage the unit'sresources consistent with Federal historic preservation and land managementstatutes, regulations, policies, and procedures. <T3>Guideline 4: Develop a general management plan.</T3> A general managementplan should be prepared to guide future planning and actions for each underwaterpark or preserve. A general management plan should discuss the unit's legislatedpurpose and significance; identify major issues affecting management anduse of the unit and its resources; and identify management objectives,planning needs and priorities. <T3>Guideline 5: Develop a resource management plan.</T3> A resource managementplan should be prepared to develop multiyear programming and action schedulesfor each underwater park or preserve. A resource management plan shoulddiscuss the significance and condition of known natural and cultural resources;assess the potential presence of as yet unknown resources; identify inventory,evaluation, documentation, preservation, and interpretation needs, priorities,and cost estimates; and discuss impacts on the resources from natural causes,visitor use, park development and other sources. The plan should be revisedperiodically to reflect scientific data collected during inventories, preservationtreatments, and changing environmental conditions, visitor uses, and parkpriorities. <T3>Guideline 6: Interpret shipwreck sites in parks and preserves.</T3>Shipwreck sites in parks and preserves should be marked with buoys andappear on nautical charts to encourage and promote recreational exploration.Recognizing that shipwreck sites are of interest to non-divers as wellas divers, interpretive materials should be developed for both interestgroups. For example, permanent signs could be placed in and around thewreck site as part of an underwater trail. Brochures and other publicationsdescribing the park or preserve's wrecks should be made available. Dockside exhibit areas and a maritime museum could be established for the park,or interpretive materials made available to the local community's museumor historical society. Video tapes also could be made available for viewingin an exhibit area or museum, and for purchase. <T3>Guideline 7: Protect shipwreck sites in parks and preserves.</T3> Mooringsshould be placed at shipwreck sites or dive boats should be required toanchor off site to protect shipwreck sites, natural areas, geological features,and habitat areas from inadvertent anchor damage. Activities that wouldcause adverse affects should be prohibited or restricted so that shipwrecksites and other resources remain intact for the enjoyment of sport diversnow and in the future. For example, collecting souvenirs and commercialwreck salvaging should be prohibited. Dredging and trawling should be restrictedto those areas of the park or preserve that do not contain shipwreck sites,natural areas, geological features, and habitat areas. In addition, archeologicalresearch should be regulated through a permit system. <T3>Guideline 8: Add new dive sites to parks and preserves.</T3> Statesshould consider including non-historic shipwrecks in underwater parks andpreserves to increase the number of interesting wreck dive sites and toreduce normal wear and tear at all wreck dive sites. If none are available,States should consider sinking non-historic vessels and structures suchas rigging from drilling platforms that no longer are needed. Guidelines for Treatment of Non-Historic Shipwrecks The majority of the abandoned shipwrecks whose title was asserted by theUnited States under the Act are probably non-historic in nature, meaningthey would not meet the criteria for listing on the National Register ofHistoric Places. While these shipwreck sites may not be of historic importance,they may nonetheless provide recreational and educational opportunitiesfor sport divers. In addition, fishermen often seek out shipwreck sitesbecause the wrecks often provide good habitat for marine life. Some shipwreckscontain commercial cargo sought after by salvors. Others may contain ``treasure''such as bullion and gems that have monetary value but often have limitedhistorical value. The following guidelines are offered to assist State and Federal agenciesin making decisions about the treatment of non-historic shipwrecks undertheir jurisdiction or control.<T3>Guideline 1: Determine the public interest in shipwreck sites. </T3>Priorto making any decisions about how to treat a non-historic shipwreck siteunder its jurisdiction, State and Federal agencies should determine theextent of public interest in the site. Agencies should consult the variousinterest groups concerning existing and potential uses of the site. Thisimportant first step will help foster a cooperative relationship betweenthe interest groups and the public agency. It also will enable the agencyto select the most appropriate treatment for a particular site by weighingits multiple values. <T3>Guideline 2: Establish standard procedures for determining how to treatsites. </T3>After consulting with the various interest groups and any shipwreckadvisory board, if one exists, States and Federal agencies should establishpolicies, uniform criteria and procedures for making decisions regardingappropriate treatments, including the collection of souvenirs and the commercialsalvage, of non-historic shipwrecks. The procedures should include a processwhereby any person may appeal a State's decision on how to treat a particularnon-historic shipwreck. <T3>Guideline 3: Provide recreational access to non-historic shipwrecks.</T3>Non-historic shipwrecks should be accessible to the public for recreationaldiving and souvenir collecting with few, if any, restrictions. For example,restrictions might be considered when a particular shipwreck site is beingcommercially salvaged. <T3>Guideline 4: Provide access to non-historic shipwrecks for commercialsalvage. </T3>Non-historic shipwrecks generally should be available forcommercial salvage with few, if any, restrictions. Federal agencies mustfollow the requirements set forth in section 310 of title 40 of the UnitedStates Code as well as any agency specific statutes and regulations forthe salvage of wrecked, abandoned, or derelict property under the agency'sjurisdiction. In addition, State and Federal agencies should conditionor prohibit salvage operations that would: (a) Impede navigation in existing Federal navigation channels; (b) Damage or destroy important natural areas, geologic formations, orhabitat areas (e.g., an ecological preserve or coralline formations protectedunder Federal or State statute, order or regulation); (c) Damage or destroy a shipwreck site that has high recreational or educationalvalue that generates substantial revenues for the local economy; or (d) Damage or destroy a shipwreck site that the State or others purposefullyhave sunk to provide additional sites for recreational diving or commercialfishing. If there are reasons to allow the commercial salvage of the kinds of shipwrecksites identified in subparagraph (c) or (d) of this guideline, conditionsshould be placed on the salvor to provide alternative dive sites. <T3>Guideline 5: Protect non-historic shipwrecks located in parks and preserves.</T3>The purpose of most State and Federal parks, preserves, and sanctuariesis to protect significant cultural or natural resources or to provide recreationaland educational opportunities for the public. Agencies that create suchareas are obligated to maintain and develop the resources for public use.Souvenir collecting and commercial salvage destroy or damage resourcesand reduce their recreational and educational values. These and other damagingactivities should be prohibited within State underwater parks and preserves,National Marine Sanctuaries, and units of the National Park System. Becausesome State-owned submerged lands are managed by Federal agencies, managementagreements between those States and Federal agencies should set forth anyspecial requirements concerning the management of State-owned shipwreckswithin the federally managed units. At a minimum, agreements between Statesand the National Park Service should prohibit souvenir collecting and commercialsalvage of historic shipwrecks located within State-owned units of theNational Park System. <T3>Guideline 6: Transfer title to artifacts recovered from non-historicshipwrecks to the person who recovered them. </T3>When making salvage awardsfor the commercial salvage of non-historic shipwrecks, States should transfertitle to the salvaged materials to the salvor. Title to souvenirs collectedby sport divers from non-historic shipwrecks also should be transferredto the sport diver collector. Guidelines for Archeological Recovery of Historic Shipwrecks As non-renewable public resources, State and federally-owned historic shipwrecksshould be managed in a manner that protects and preserves them for thepublic. The archeological recovery of all or parts of historic shipwrecksenables underwater archeologists and maritime historians to collect newdata or confirm archival documentation regarding a specific vessel, a typeor method of construction, an historic event or period, or a culture. Historicshipwrecks under the jurisdiction of State and Federal agencies shouldbe made available to scientists for study and excavation, consistent withthe following guidelines. <T3>Guideline 1: Issue Federal archeological permits in accordance withthe Archaeological Resources Protection Act. </T3>Federal agencies mustreview and approve or deny requests for the archeological recovery of historicshipwrecks located on public and Indian lands by following the permittingrequirements set forth in the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (16U.S.C. 470<T3>aa-ll</T3>), its uniform regulations (43 CFR Part 7; 36 CFR Part 296;18 CFR Part 1312; 32 CFR Part 229), any agency specific supplemental regulations,and other agency specific statutes and regulations concerning the excavationof archeological resources on public and Indian lands.\1\<NOTE/> Guideline No. 3 under Guidelines for Managing ShipwrecksUnder Federal Jurisdiction summarizes the permitting requirements set forthunder those statutes and regulations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Abandoned shipwrecks located on the outer continentalshelf are not subject to the provisions of the Archaeological ResourcesProtection Act (16 U.S.C. 470<T3>aa-ll</T3>) and are unaffected by the Abandoned Shipwreck Act (43 U.S.C.2101). Those shipwrecks remain under the jurisdiction of Federal admiraltylaw. <T3>Guideline 2: Develop an archeological permit process for State-ownedshipwrecks. </T3>Each State should establish permitting requirements andprocedures for the archeological recovery of State-owned historic shipwrecksafter consulting with the various interest groups and the State's shipwreckadvisory board, if one exists. The procedures should include a processwhereby an applicant or permittee may appeal a State's decision to issue,modify, suspend, revoke or deny a permit. States are encouraged to holdpublic meetings to ensure that all affected persons have an opportunityto voice their opinions. <T3>Guideline 3: Ensure that the State permit process requires work tobe done in a professional manner. </T3>At a minimum, State archeologicalpermitting procedures should ensure that: (a) The applicant meets pertinent professional qualifications to carryout the proposed activity; (b) The proposed activity is for the purpose of furthering archeologicaland historical knowledge in the public interest; (c) The artifacts, material remains, and associated records will be preservedin a suitable repository; (d) The artifacts and materials that are recovered will remain the propertyof the State; (e) The proposed activity is fully consistent with the State's historicpreservation management plan and other established plan for the shipwrecksite, underwater park or preserve; and (f) The applicant has secured other necessary State or Federal permits.<T3>Guideline 4: Protect environmental, recreational, and educational values.</T3>Federal and State agencies should condition or prohibit activitiesconducted under an archeological permit that would: (a) Impede navigation in existing Federal navigation channels; (b) Damage or destroy important natural areas, geologic formations, orhabitat areas (e.g., an ecological preserve or coralline formations protectedunder Federal or State statute, order or regulation); or (c) Damage or destroy a shipwreck site that has high recreational or educationalvalue. <T3>Guideline 5: Make the results of archeological studies available. </T3>Federaland State agencies should ensure that the results of the activities conductedunder an archeological permit will be made available to the public andthe professional community. For example, articles, brochures, books, videotapes, slide shows, exhibits, or underwater trails for the public shouldbe prepared, or existing ones updated. Articles written for the publicshould be published in popular national and regional magazines. A scientificreport always should be prepared and made available to the professionalcommunity. Copies of reports also should be provided to the State HistoricPreservation Officer, the State Archeologist, and appropriate Federal HistoricPreservation Officers so that the data collected can be incorporated intoFederal and State historic preservation plans. Permittees also should beencouraged to deliver papers at scientific meetings and publish articlesin professional journals.<T3>Guideline 6: Involve public and private interests in permitted activities.</T3>Federal and State agencies should encourage permittees to involveappropriate public and private interests such as sport divers, avocationalarcheologists, corporate and private sponsors, and commercial photographersin permitted activities. For example, sport divers and avocational archeologistsmight volunteer their skills on a mapping project or excavation. Volunteersshould be properly supervised by qualified professionals appropriate tothe nature of the volunteer work (i.e., archival research, underwater excavation,or conservation of artifacts recovered). Corporate sponsors or commercialbusinessmen might donate the use of a survey vessel, supplies, and equipmentin exchange for media rights. Guidelines for Considering and Mitigating Effects of Federal Activitieson Historic Shipwrecks Some activities that are carried out, funded or licensed by Federal agencieshave the potential to affect historic shipwrecks. Examples would includedredging, discharge of material into a waterway, construction of harborfacilities, mineral exploration or development, wreck and drift removal,salvage of shipwrecks, wildlife habitat improvement, and shoreline or channelimprovement. Such activities are subject to review under section 106 ofthe National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470). In such cases,the responsible Federal agency must comply with the implementing regulations(36 CFR Part 800) of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. Thefollowing guidelines are offered to assist Federal agencies in complyingwith these and other requirements under section 110 of the same Act. <T3>Guideline 1: Consider the effects of Federal undertakings on historicshipwrecks on a project by project basis. </T3>In consultation with thepertinent State Historic Preservation Officer and other persons knowledgeableabout or concerned about historic shipwrecks and other submerged historicproperties in the.project area, the responsible Federal agency should:(a) Identify shipwrecks and other historic properties subject to possibleeffect by the undertaking, and evaluate them to determine their eligibilityfor inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places; (b) If shipwrecks or other historic properties included in or eligiblefor inclusion in the National Register are identified, determine whetherthe undertaking will affect them and, if so, whether the effect will beadverse; (c) If adverse effects will occur, seek ways to avoid or reduce such effectsand, if agreement is reached on how to avoid or reduce such effects, executea Memorandum of Agreement that sets forth the agreed upon measures, andinsure that the terms of the Agreement are implemented; (d) Afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation a reasonable opportunityto comment on the undertaking. For example, the Advisory Council mightparticipate in development or execution of the Agreement, or approve theAgreement executed by the State and Federal agency. In the absence of anAgreement, the Advisory Council should review the undertaking and renderformal comment to the responsible agency head; and (e) In cases of an emergency or the unexpected discovery of shipwrecksor other properties that are or may be historic, carry out special expeditedprocedures to consider and, where feasible, reduce adverse effects on suchproperties. <T3>Guidline 2: Consider effects on a programmatic basis. </T3>As an alternativeto the project by project approach discussed in Guideline No. l (above),certain Federal agencies should consult with the Advisory Council and otherinterested parties to develop and implement a Programmatic Agreement orcounterpart regulations to establish special agency specific proceduresfor the identification, consideration, and protection of historic shipwrecksand other historic properties. Such agencies would include those that haveongoing management responsibilities for submerged lands that may containhistoric properties, and Federal agencies that conduct, fund or regulaterecurrent activities that rnay affect such properties. <T3>Guideline 3: Consider effects using State review procedures. </T3>Incertain States, the Advisory Council and the State Historic PreservationOfficer have entered into an agreement to allow the State's special reviewand consultation process to substitute for the procedures set forth inthe Advisory Council's regulations. In those States, a Federal agency may,at its discretion, comply with the State's process in lieu of compliancewith the Advisory Council's regulations. <T3>Guideline 4: Consult with State shipwreck management agencies whenState-owned historic shipwrecks may be affected: </T3>Where a Federal,federally assisted or federally regulated undertaking will have adverseeffects on a State-owned historic shipwreck, the State agency responsiblefor regulating access to the wreck should be afforded the opportunity tobe a consulting party during the section 106 consultation process. <T3>Guideline 5: Include the various interest groups in the consultationprocess. </T3>The Advisory Council's regulations allow for and emphasizethe participation of ``interested persons'' during the section 106 consultationprocess. ``Interested persons'' are defined in subsection 800.2(h) of thoseregulations as ``those organizations and individuals that are concernedwith the effects of an undertaking on historic properties.'' ``Interestedpersons'' that should be contacted for information regarding the identificationof historic shipwrecks and consideration of the undertaking's potentialeffects on those sites include the: (a) State agency responsible for regulating shipwreck access; (b) Federal, State, regional, and local governmental agencies, Indian tribes,and private landowners having control or jurisdiction over the submergedlands, shipwrecks, or adjacent lands; (c) Sport divers, dive instructors, dive boat operators, fishermen, andsalvors interested in shipwrecks; and (d) Historic, archeological, curatorial and other organizations interestedin historic shipwrecks. <T3>Guideline 6: Document historic shipwrecks that will be destroyed orsubstantially altered. </T3>Where a Federal or federally assisted undertakingwill destroy or substantially alter a historic shipwreck site, section110(b) of the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470) requiresthat each Federal agency ensure that appropriate records are made of thesite and deposited in the Library of Congress or other institution designatedby the Secretary of the Interior. The level of recordation should be agreedupon by the Federal agency, the State Historic Preservation Officer, andthe Advisory Council on Historic Preservation as a part of the consultationprocess under section 106 of the same Act. <T3>Guideline 7: Minimize harm to historic shipwrecks designated as NationalHistoric Landmarks. </T3>Where a Federal undertaking will directly andadversely affect an historic shipwreck designated as a National HistoricLandmark, section 110(f) of the National Historic Preservation Act (16U.S.C. 470) requires that each Federal agency take steps, to the maximumextent feasible, to minimize harm to the landmark and afford the AdvisoryCouncil on Historic Preservation an opportunity to comment on the undertaking.Guidelines for Managing Shipwrecks Under Federal Jurisdiction Federal agencies are responsible for managing and protecting historic shipwrecksunder their control or jurisdiction. The Antiquities Act of 1906 (16 U.S.C.431-433) was the first statute to set forth these responsibilities. TheAbandoned Shipwreck Act (43 U.S.C. 2101) is the latest in a series of historicpreservation laws. Two other statutes that set forth the most comprehensivelisting of Federal historic preservation responsibilities are the NationalHistoric Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470) and the Archaeological ResourcesProtection Act (16 U.S.C. 470<T3>aa-ll</T3>). These and related preservation and land management statutesestablish more stringent requirements for protecting federally owned andadministered historic properties than does the Abandoned Shipwreck Act.Recognizing the differences, the Congress addressed the matter in the legislativehistory accompanying the Abandoned Shipwreck Act. The Congress clearlyindicated that historic shipwrecks within units of the National Park Systemare to be preserved, regardless of whether they lie in State or Federalwaters. The following guidelines are offered to assist Federal agencies in managinghistoric shipwrecks under their control or jurisdiction. <T3>Guideline 1: Manage historic shipwrecks in accordance with the NationalHistoric Preservation Act. </T3>In accordance with section 110 of the NationalHistoric Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470), where a Federal agency ownsor controls submerged lands, the agency must:(a) Assume responsibility for the preservation of historic shipwreck siteslocated on federally-owned or controlled submerged lands; (b) To the maximum extent feasible, use historic shipwreck sites undertheir ownership or control for agency purposes (examples might includestudying and interpreting the sites for the public); (c) In accordance with appropriate professional standards, take steps topreserve historic shipwreck sites under their ownership or control (examplesmight include stabilizing and preserving historic shipwrecks in place,and recording and recovering sites when preservation in place is not feasible);(d) In cooperation with the State Historic Preservation Officer, establishprograms to locate, inventory, and nominate historic shipwrecks under theirownership or control for inclusion in the National Register of HistoricPlaces; (e) Exercise caution to ensure that historic shipwreck sites under theirownership or control are not inadvertently transferred, sold, destroyed,substantially altered, or allowed to deteriorate significantly; (f) Where a Federal or federally assisted undertaking will destroy or substantiallyalter a historic shipwreck site, ensure that appropriate records are madeof the site and deposited in the Library of Congress or other institutiondesignated by the Secretary of the Interior. The level of recordation shouldbe agreed upon by the Federal agency, the State Historic Preservation Officer,and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation as a part of the consultationprocess under section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (16U.S.C. 470); and (g) Where a Federal undertaking will directly and adversely affect a historicshipwreck designated as a National Historic Landmark, to the maximum extentfeasible, take steps to minimize harm to the landmark and afford the AdvisoryCouncil on Historic Preservation an opportunity to comment on the undertaking.<T3>Guideline 2: Use the Secretary of the Interior's guidelines. </T3>Inaccordance with subsection 101(f) of the National Historic PreservationAct (16 U.S.C. 470), the National Park Service developed ``Guidelines forFederal Agency Responsibilities Under Section 110 of the National HistoricPreservation Act.''
