<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-79-0287 </DOCNO><TEXT>The concepts reported here are all in the category rotating (turbine)wind energy converter and can be subdivided in three main functionalcategories namely: Axial-Flow Turbine (AFT), Cross-Flow Turbine (CFT)and Dual (combined)-Flow Turbine (DFT) the latter a combination of systemelements applying AFT and CFT. Within the AFT category, two conceptsare described: the Swept-Blade Turbine (SWBT) and the Catenary-RibbonBlade Turbine (CRBT). Augmentation of turbine mass flow and power outputby increasing the effective sweep area of AFT can be achieved by movingthe rotor hub. Concepts described within the CFT category are LDB (L-bladeand Double Blade) to straight bladed CFT-VAWFS, inclined shaft CFT withsingle and multiple shafts, Spiral Blade Concept, Fluid Ring BearingVAWT. Further some Dual-Flow Turbine concepts (DFT) are discussed. Theseconsist of a large primary turbine (AFT or CFT) catching wind energyand transferring it directly to a much smaller secondary turbine (orBrade-Turbine, BT) with high rpm, mounted on the primary turbine. Amongalternatives discussed are primary AFT and CFT in combination with secondaryAFT and CFT. Finally, the potential for future application of the mostpromising concepts are commented upon.</TEXT></DOC>
