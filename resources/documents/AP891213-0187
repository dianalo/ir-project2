A task force comprising representatives of the Federal AviationAdministration, airlines and aircraft manufacturers began studyingthe safety of older planes last year in the wake of severalage-related accidents. It began its work in October 1988, sixmonths after a section of the fuselage of an Aloha Airlines jetpeeled off over the Pacific Ocean.   Jack Naughton, director of aircraft heavy maintenance for USAir,said Wednesday that FAA inspection recommendations are likely tobecome mandatory in February. Naughton called the Aloha Airlinesaccident, which killed a flight attendant and injured dozens ofpassengers, the catalyst for the closer look at older planes.   USAir selected three DC-9s, each about 20 years old, for theprogram. The airline has completed what it calls an inch-by-inchinspection of one DC-9 and returned it to the USAir 400-plane fleet.   The second plane in the program is at an airline maintenancehangar at Pittsburgh's airport. Mechanics are to have it finishedwithin a month.   The 22-year-old DC-9, built for Delta Airlines in 1967 andbought by USAir a decade later, has been stripped of its paint andcabin furnishings. Three shifts of 18 mechanics each work day andnight, searching for flaws not readily revealed by more commoninspection techniques.   The thick smell of primer floats inside the hangar and there isa constant whir of machinery and ping of hammers on rivets.   Mostly, the mechanics are looking for evidence of corrosion,which airline officials believe leads to fuselage cracks.   Standing over a table beside the 107-foot-long plane, mechanicHarry Garman worked Wednesday to replace corroded metal fromunderneath the aircraft.   ``We'll either treat it or we'll replace it, depending on thedepth of it,'' Garman said.   ``It's kind of like your rusty fender on a car,'' he explained.``If it's just a little bit of rust, you clean it up and paint it,but if it's real deep, you replace that area.''   Working on a scaffold alongside the plane, Charlie Slack placeda metal reinforcing strip above the plane's windows from front torear. Tests have shown that area to be more susceptible to stresscracks than other parts of the plane.   USAir estimates the procedure will cost about $1 million perplane. After the first three DC-9s are completed, airline officialswill review the program and make any necessary adjustments beforecontinuing.   George Mason, the airline's vice president of heavy maintenance,said 29 planes are scheduled to be completed in the next fouryears. A total of 50 of USAir's 74 DC-9s will be stripped andinspected, he said.   Mason said he's not worried that patching up the aircraft mightmake USAir's fleet look less sky-worthy.   ``It all in your perspective,'' he said. ``When you see anairplane at the gate that has patches on it, should you beconcerned _ or should you be concerned if you see an airplane thatdoesn't have them?''</TEXT></DOC>
