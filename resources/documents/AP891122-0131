SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, theEast bloc's first non-Communist government leader, travels Thursdayto the Soviet Union in hopes of resolving sensitive issues andmaking headway on economic reforms.   More than 40 years of Communist rule in Poland ended Aug. 24when the Parliament elected Mazowiecki, a former Solidarity editorand close adviser to Lech Walesa, to lead the new government.   The Soviet government sent its ``friendly congratulations'' uponMazowiecki's election. Mazowiecki has said Poland would respect itsWarsaw Pact obligations but that relations between the twocountries must be based on reciprocity.   Though bound by economic and military treaties to Moscow, thenew government is emotionally distant from its powerful neighbor,which installed Communists in Poland after World War II.   Mazowiecki's first foreign trip took him to Rome to meet withPolish-born Pope John Paul II and not to Moscow, as traditionrequired of his Communist predecessors.   During the trip, Mazowiecki intends to raise the painful matterof ``blank spots'' in history, such as the massacre of Polishofficers during World War II in the Katyn forest, as well as seekan improvement in the situation of an estimated 2 million Polesliving in the Soviet Union.   Poland also would like to renegotiate the terms of trade withthe Soviet Union, which accounts for one-third of Poland's foreigntrade. A high-level delegation of economic officials isaccompanying Mazowiecki.   Poland conducts one-third of its foreign trade with the SovietUnion and is seeking Soviet support for its transition to amarket-oriented economy and efforts to make its currency, thezloty, convertible.   The Soviet Union exercises considerable influence on the Polisheconomy because it supplies almost all of Poland's oil, naturalgas, and iron ore as well as many of the cars, planes, washingmachines and televisions.   Polish government spokesman Malgorzata Niezabitowska said thecurrent situation in East Germany and the issue of eventual Germanunification would be among the issues discussed.   Both Poland and the Soviet Union have suffered from Germanaggression in the past and appear to be wary of the potentialemergence of a powerful German nation in the heart of Europe.   Mazowiecki is to spend two days in Moscow meeting with Sovietofficials, including President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Mazowiecki, a Roman Catholic, is to travel Sunday to the city ofZagorsk, the site of a Russian Orthodox monastery.   Later that day, he is scheduled to travel West to the Katynforest, where more than 4,300 Polish officers were murdered inWorld War II.   Katyn is one of the war's most painful memories for Poles, and aSoviet memorial to the officers places responsibility for themurder on Hitler's army.   Most Poles and Western historians believe that the officers weremassacred by the Soviet secret police in the spring of 1940 afterthey were deported to the Soviet Union following the oubreak ofWorld War II.   A joint Soviet-Polish historical commission established byGorbachev and Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski in 1987 to clearup the ``blank spots'' has yet to deliver a verdict.   This year, the Polish side of the commission said there is noreasonable doubt the Soviets were responsible.   Mazowiecki is also planning to meet with representatives of theestimated 2 million-member Polish community in the Soviet Union.Millions of Poles were deported to the Soviet Union during WorldWar II and many were not allowed to return after the war.   Niezabitowska said Poland wants Poles living in the Soviet Unionto have greater possibilities to cultivate their native culture andtraditions.   Mazowiecki also will visit Leningrad.</TEXT></DOC>
