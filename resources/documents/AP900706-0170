Callejas, who took office on Jan. 27, said the payments wereobligations from the past that must be honored.   ``These situations are disagreeable and you have to forget aboutthem,'' he told The Associated Press. ``They are things of the pastand now we are facing the challenge of the future.''   The legislature approved $625,000 for the family of ManfredoVelasquez Rodriguez, a 28-year-old economist, and $75,000 for thefamily of Saul Godinez Cruz, 32, an elementary education teacher,the amounts ordered by the Inter-American Human Rights Court inCosta Rica.   The court, created by the Organization of the American States,ruled both died at the hands of killers ``acting under theprotection'' of the government.   The case was brought by the Honduran Human Rights Commission,which blamed the murders on military death squads who preyed onsuspected leftists.   Velasquez Rodriguez was last seen being arrested on Sept. 12,1981. He had recently graduated from the National University, wherehe was a student leader. Godinez Cruz was last seen being picked upon July 22, 1982.   They were among at least 300 people who human rightsorganizations say died at the hands of death squads between 1979and 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
