Rightly or wrongly, Bush invoked the Horton case as evidence hisDemocratic opponent, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, was moreconcerned about criminals than about their victims.   Now, the specter of ... Horton has come back to haunt the OvalOffice. During a congressional abortion debate, Rep. Steny H.Hoyer, D-Md., raised these hypothetical questions: What if Hortonhad impregnated his victim? Would President Bush want her to bear(Horton's) baby? ...   An aroused electorate is closely watching the uncomfortablegyrations of politicians and subjecting them to an abortion litmustest. Time will tell how many candidates will lose because of theirabortion positions _ or win despite them.   Regardless, Bush should have approved the proposed abortionfunding for poor victims of violent sex crimes. He could haveemerged as a voice of compassion and reason. Instead, he seemed tobox himself into a narrow corner, far from the middle ground of themajority.</TEXT><TEXT>   Nov. 14   St. Louis Post-Dispatch on homosexuals in the military:   A recent Gallup Poll showed that 60 percent of Americans believethat homosexuals should have a right to serve in the armed forces;that figure is up from 52 percent in 1982. But if the public isbecoming more tolerant about homosexuals in uniform, the Pentagonis not, judging from its reaction to a couple of studies on thetopic.   The first study ... is on whether homosexuals are security risks.   After reviewing the professional literature, the researchersconclude that homosexuals posed no more of a risk to expionageblackmail than heterosexuals. When the Pentagon saw an early draft,it called the report flawed, biased and a waste of money. ...   The Pentagon's overreaction was not due to the quality of thereport's scholarship, which is high, but to the fact that thestudy's findings disagree with the current Pentagon policy to banall homosexuals, period.   A second study by the center also set off fireworks. It foundthat homosexuals who attempted to join the military had fewerpersonal problems and were likely to adjust to military life ``asgood or better than heterosexuals.''   Social attitudes are slowly changing on this issue: ThePentagon's assumptions should change as well.</TEXT><TEXT>   Nov. 13   Portland (Maine) Press Herald on the First Amendment:   Figure this one: A national consumer group is asking Congress toprevent a major American manufacturer from sponsoring anadvertising campaign commemorating _ get this, now _ the Bill ofRights.   The company in question is Philip Morris. The consumer outfit,Public Citizen Health Research Group, says the promotion ``smearsthe Bill of Rights with the blood of all Americans killed as aresult of smoking.''   The cigarette manufacturer agreed to donate $600,000 towardconstruction of an exhibit gallery in the National Archives and tosponsor a series of television ads _ with archives cooperation _celebrating the 200th anniversary of the adoption of the first 10amendments to the Constitution.   A spokesman for the Health Research Group says the agreementallows Philip Morris to ``obscure its deadly role in American andworldwide society'' and should be reversed. It has called uponCongress to do the reversing.   For heavens sake, we're talking the Bill of Rights here. Ifanything is being obscured it's the First Amendment rights of aperfectly legal business enterprise engaged in a perfectlyhonorable celebration of American freedoms.   Under the First Amendment, the Public Citizen Health ResearchGroup is free to condemn smoking, tobacco manufacturing, governmentsubsidies of tobacco growers or anything else.   It is decidedly not free to prevent anybody _ including thetobacco industry _ from coming out in favor of the Bill of Rights.</TEXT><TEXT>   Nov. 11   Los Angeles Times on the stealth bomber:   Congress is poised to pay for at least two more B-2 stealthbombers at $530 million each, the most expensive airplane in thenation's history. But it also has attached enough strings to makecertain that the B-2 does not fly away with the defense budget.   That makes sense, in light of a study that says that the UnitedStates would spend 14 timesas much to hit a target with a B-2 as itwould have to spend to hit the same target with alternative weaponsalready on hand...   In theory, the B-2 could pounce on targets before an enemy knewit was coming. But according to a recent analysis published byHarvard University's International Security magazine, using a B-2would cost more than using a Midgetman missile, a single-warheadmissile that the Air Force has resisted as too expensive.   In fact, the ability to sneak past radar may not even beimportant in a war. The bomber would reach targets in the SovietUnion long after the United States had started retaliating withlong-range missiles that might well have destroyed or at leastripped big holes in the radar screen of the Soviet air-defensenetwork, so stealth would not be important.   If some radar were to survive, there are nearly 100 B-1b bombersalready on duty that the Air Force says are nearly as elusive asthe B-2. ...   Stealth bombers would be good for dropping bombs that wouldburrow into Soviet command posts and explode, the Air Force says.But does that mission make sense? Would America want to kill theonly Soviets who might be able and willing to call off a nuclearwar?</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
