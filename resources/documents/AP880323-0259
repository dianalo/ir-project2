First RepublicBank, weakened by a run on deposits and recentmultimillion-dollar losses, received a $1 billion injection ofcapital last week from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.   But because it could take as much as $5 billion to rescue thenation's 13th-largest bank holding company, banking regulators areconsidering selling First RepublicBank's individual operations as amarketing alternative.   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said such a move ``certainly isan option.''   No spokesman for FirstRepublic Bank was available Tuesday tocomment on the idea.   ``The first thing you think of is splitting the company intobite-size morsels,'' said James Sexton, a former FDIC director ofsupervision who is a consultant at Bracewell andamp; Patterson, anAustin, Texas law firm.   The holding company's banks in major markets could be packagedtogether or in regional or in statewide combinations, analystssaid. The holding company has banks in Dallas, Austin, Houston andSan Antonio.   ``It's a very large bank for someone else to acquire,'' saidTanya Azarchs, a banking analyst with New York-based Standard andamp;Poor's Corp. ``I don't see anyone on the scene that's willing to dothat.''   Although the breakup of the holding company could make it moreaccessible to investors, some argue it would be better if thecompany remained intact.   ``These banks are intertwined, having common management,borrowers and computer systems,'' Sexton said. ``Breaking offchunks presents some tough administrative problems.''   The bank holding company already is consolidating some of itsbanks, which could make a breakup more difficult. FirstRepublicBank already has cut the number of banks from 103 to 73,and plans to consolidate until only 40 banks are left.   First RepublicBank reported a 1987 loss of $656.8 million, $3.92billion in problem assets and had deposit outflows of more than $2billion this year. Its assets total about $33.2 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
