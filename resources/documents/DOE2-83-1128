<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-83-1128 </DOCNO><TEXT>The current status of a novel crystallographic technique to determinespecific-site occupations of elemental additions in crystalline materials,using the channelling or Borrman effect in electron diffraction is discussed.This technique is based on the effect of incident beam orientations onthe intensities of either the characteristic x-ray emissions or the characteristicelectron energy-loss edges. In general, this technique is in good agreementwith other well established methods such as x-ray and neutron diffractionbut has superior spatial resolution. It involves no adjustable parameters,external standards or special specimen preparations; can distinguishneighbors in the periodic table; is very accurate and is applicable totrace elemental concentrations. In the EELS formulation, the techniquecan also provide specific site valence information. Finally, the applicabilityto the study of site occupancies in magnetic materials (spinels, Sm{sub2}(Co,TM){sub 17} alloys, (Y,RE){sub 3}Fe{sub 5}O{sub 12} epitaxial films,etc.) has been well demonstrated. 23 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
