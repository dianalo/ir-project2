Iran reported no casualties in Qom, a holy city of 250,000 whereAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini once made his home. The 87-year-oldrevolutionary patriarch has lived for several years in Jamaran, anorthern Tehran suburb.   The Iraqis said they fired eight surface-to-surface missilesWednesday, two of them into Qom, bringing the total for three daysto 24. Iran said it hit Baghdad with three missiles, for a total ofeight in the same period.   ``Fear not,'' Khomeini told Iranians in remarks quoted by theofficial Islamic Republic News Agency. ``It does not make anydifference for a people who seek martyrdom whether they are killedby missiles, tanks or artillery.''   Both sides reported civilian casualties in their capital cities,and Iran said Iraqi warplanes also raided a village near Rasht 150miles northeast of Tehran. IRNA said ``several civilians'' werekilled Wednesday in Tehran and bombs destroyed the mosque in thevillage.   Baghdad's official Iraqi News Agency said the Iranian rocketskilled or wounded civilians and demolished houses and shops inresidential neighborhoods of the Arab capital, but was not morespecifics.   Iran said Wednesday's hits on Tehran wounded 15 people, bringingthe total to 115. Before the general report about casualties inTehran, it had reported 27 killed in the capital and five in thevillage near Rasht.   It said casualties included two newlyweds killed in the villageand an 80-year-old woman wounded in Tehran.   Western military analysts believe Iraq uses Soviet-made Scud-Bmissiles fitted with strap-on boosters enabling them to reachTehran, which is 290 miles from the border. Qom is roughly the samedistance from the frontier.   Iran's weapons also are Scud-Bs, provided by its Arab alliesSyria and Libya, but without boosters because Baghdad is only 80miles from the border.   This week's attacks by Iraq are its first on Tehran and Qom withsurface-to-surface missiles. President Saddam Hussein's governmentdeclared in August it had acquired missiles that could reach theIranian capital, a city of 6 million people.   The Iraqi air force, which has an estimated 8-1 advantage overIran's, has made many raids on Iranian cities and bombed Qomrepeatedly in January 1987.   Thousands of civilian lives have been lost in the ``war of thecities,'' the periodic rounds of bombing and missile attacks in aconflict that has claimed at least 1 million casualties since itbegan in September l980.   Iran said its artillery batteries, in response to the rocketingof Tehran, shelled military and economic installations in the Iraqicities of Basra, Ammara, Badra, Zorbatiya, Ali Sharqi and AliGharbi.   Dispatches from Iraq said its warplanes bombed the westernIranian town of Dezful and Karaj, a city near Tehran, setting theirtargets ablaze. Iran did not report the raids.   Iraq said it began the missile barrage of Tehran in retaliationfor two Iranian rockets that hit Baghdad before dawn Monday. Irandescribed the missiles as a response to Iraqi air raids on theTehran oil refinery last week.</TEXT></DOC>
