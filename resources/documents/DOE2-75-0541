The calculation methods and correlations of heat transfercoefficients in dispersed droplet post dryout regime, transition boiling,film boiling and of minimum film boiling temperature were correlatedwith experimental data performed in different fluids. The assessmentsof the comparisons resulted in recommendations for easy-to-use calculationmethods, rules and instructions for engineering-use. (orig.) With 15figs., 10 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
