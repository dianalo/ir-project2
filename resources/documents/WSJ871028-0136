Germany's trade surplus totaled 11.51 billion marks ($6.49 billion) in September, up from surpluses of 10.4 billion marks a year earlier and 6.51 billion marks in August, the Federal Statistics Office said.    The latest data are likely to prove embarrassing for the German government, which has been under persistent pressure from the U.S. to bring the country's trade surplus down by stimulating domestic demand for imports. The figures could be especially irksome following harsh criticism earlier this month by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker of what was then the German central bank's move toward a less-accommodative monetary policy.    &quot;It doesn't look great for the reduction of the surplus,&quot; said Benedict Tanner, an economist at the IFO economic research institute in Munich. The 1987 trade surplus is likely to match last year's record level of 112.6 billion marks, he added.    In the first nine months, the trade surplus totaled 83.5 billion marks, a record for the period, up from 79.6 billion marks a year earlier. The September surplus was the second-largest ever, just short of the record 11.6 billion-mark surplus in December 1986.    With foreign manufacturing orders surging, exports totaled 45.79 billion marks in September, up 3.1% from a year-earlier and 27% higher than August's level. Imports, meanwhile, rose just 0.7% from a year earlier, to 34.29 billion marks, but were up 16% from August.    Although it doesn't show in the nominal trade balance, economists continue to note that Germany has contributed to improving global trade imbalances over the first nine months on a volume basis. When the nominal, or value-based, figures are adjusted for price changes caused largely by currency fluctuations, imports for the first nine months show a 4% increase from last year, while exports are only up 1%.    Still, most economists expect Germany's record nominal trade surpluses to persist for the foreseeable future, barring drastic new movements in the foreign-exchange value of the mark against the currencies of the country's major trading partners.    The current account, which includes trade in goods and services as well as certain unilateral transfers, totaled 6.5 billion marks in September, down from 7.3 billion marks a year earlier but up from a 2.4 billion-mark surplus in August, according to preliminary figures from the German central bank. For the first nine months, the current-account surplus totaled 53.1 billion marks, up marginally from 53 billion marks a year earlier. Economists generally expect the surplus for the full year to decline from last year's 80.5 billion-mark total. </TEXT></DOC>
