Gen. Maxwell Thurman, head of the U.S. Southern Command, toldreporters at a new conference in Panama that a top U.S. prioritywas to ``raise the (Panamanian) police force and get it back inoperation.''   In Washington, Gen. Tom Kelly, director of operations for theJoint Chiefs of Staff, stressed the importance of the militarypolice.   ``The role we will play is assisting the Panamanians ... inmaintaining order and recapturing and controlling of theirinstitutions like the police,'' he said.   ``We've got to re-establish law and order throughout PanamaCity,'' said Lt. Col. Bill Bennett, a top military planner.   Military experts said the military police might work withPanamanian Defense Forces loyal to new President Guillermo Endara,training them and incorporating them on patrols.   U.S. officials spoke while mobs, some devoted to ousted Gen.Manuel Noriega, roamed Panama City, ``breaking windows, enteringprivate homes, looting at will,'' according to Jan Edmonson, theU.S. Embassy spokesman in Panama City.   By Friday _ the third day of the U.S. intervention _ themilitary police numbered 3,000, Bennett said. Some 1,500reinforcements from Fort Bragg, N.C., were brought in to help. Alltold, U.S. troops number about 24,000.   U.S. military officials refused to say how long they would keepcombat troops in Panama, but Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman ofthe House Armed Services Committee, predicted the military policemight be in for a long haul.   ``I would not be surprised to see them there on Christmas Eve ayear from now,'' he said.   Military police _ or MPs _ have a number of specific tasks,including security and law enforcement at U.S. bases, the supportof combat forces and protection of prisoners of war. In Panama,some 1,400 pro-Noriega loyalists are being held prisoner, Thurmansaid.   American MPs ``are not too much unlike a civilian policeforce,'' said Michael Abrams, a spokesman at Fort McClellan nearAnniston, Ala., home of the U.S. Army Military Police School.   MPs were recently in the headlines when they were sent to theVirgin Islands to restore calm after Hurricane Hugo. But Abramssaid the situation in the Virgin Islands differed substantiallyfrom that in Panama.   In the islands, MPs worked in concert with local law enforcementofficers, letting the civil authorities play the lead role inmaking arrests and controlling disorderly conduct.   But in Panama, ``it seems like the whole country has been turnedupside down,'' he said. ``I haven't the faintest idea how they areoperate.''   Richard Armitage, a former Defense Department official,suggested the new government in Panama temporarily might empowerthe MPs with authority to make arrests and handle other problems.   MPs, often the most visible servicemen because of their publicfunction, are trained to handle scores of tasks from criminalinvestigations to traffic. On bases, they commonly patrol housingareas, set up speed traps and make arrests.   They also protect convoys, set up perimeter security and quelldisturbances.</TEXT></DOC>
