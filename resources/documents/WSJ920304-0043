In a spate of buying late in the trading session, theprice of crude oil for April delivery climbed by 30 cents abarrel to $18.64. Prices of heating oil and gasoline alsorose.</LP><TEXT>   Market action had been slow through most of yesterday.However, remarks made by Algerian Oil Minister NordineAit-Laoussine about the possibility that ministers of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries might meetbefore the scheduled April 24 gathering sparked a run-up inprices. &quot;If prices stay where they are I think we'll have tomeet earlier . . . that's my own feeling,&quot; he said at aconference sponsored by Petroleum Finance Co. in Washington.   OPEC experts believe that Saudi Arabia will oppose anymove by OPEC ministers to meet early. &quot;I don't think theSaudis will sit down before April 24, and they are in aposition to get what they want,&quot; said Cyril Malak, analystfor Energy Security Analysis Inc.   Because Mr. Ait-Laoussine perceives the market to be weak,his remarks should have been seen as bearish. However, theprospect of another OPEC meeting in the near future wasconsidered bullish by oil men who are hopeful that such agathering might result in another cut in output. At a meetingin Geneva last month, OPEC ministers agreed to reduce dailyproduction by more than one million barrels to about 23million barrels. But the cuts were smaller than marketparticipants anticipated, and oil prices have weakened as aresult.   Reports of continued political unrest in Venezuelafollowing a coup attempt last month also made tradersskittish. Armed forces there have been placed on alertfollowing several raids in the past three days on militaryfacilities, according to Dow Jones International PetroleumReport. Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez has beencalled on repeatedly to resign by several factions in recentdays.   But underlying yesterday's move to firmer prices iscontinued uneasiness among market participants who believethat global oil supplies are abundant. In an event thatseemed to support that sentiment, at least symbolically,Texaco Inc. began pumping oil from the so-called NeutralZone, a territory jointly held by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.Texaco has a concession agreement with Saudi Arabia tooperate the kingdom's share of production there.   The refinery and three oil fields located in the zone weredecimated by Iraqi troops during last year's Persian GulfWar. In a ceremony amid the rubble there, Texaco ChiefExecutive Officer James Kinnear, Saudi Oil Minister HishamNazer and Kuwaiti Oil Minister Humoud Al-Rquba gave the orderto resume output. Initial production from the Neutral Zoneisn't expected to exceed 40,000 barrels a day. Before thewar, output ran as high as 135,000 barrels daily.   But debunking the notion of burgeoning inventories andoversupply, Mr. Malak of Energy Security Analysis says thatoil supplies are tight in Asia and balanced in Europe. Hesaid that only North America is oversupplied with oil butthat excess inventory should be eliminated if OPEC memberslive up to their commitment to shave one million barrels offtheir total production this month.   In a report that caught some traders by surprise,statistics released by the American Petroleum Institute lateyesterday showed an unexpected increase in crude-oilinventories in the U.S. last week. Crude stocks climbed by5.64 million barrels to 339.8 million. Gasoline andheating-oil inventories, however, declined. Refinery runs,which indicate how much crude was run through U.S. refineriesduring the period, slipped by 0.9 percentage point to 79.2%.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices of wheat futures contractsdropped amid profit-taking and selling by farmers. Wheatprices had rallied Monday after the U.S. government released$200 million of food-buying loan guarantees to the formerSoviet republics. The Commonwealth of Independent Statesquickly exhausted the allocation to finance purchases of U.S.crops. The Agriculture Department approved the commonwealth'sbids for 585,000 metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat. Onetrader said wheat prices were also depressed somewhat by anAgriculture Department decision against selling subsidizedU.S. wheat to India. Under its Export Enhancement Program,the Agriculture Department compensates exporters that selldiscount-priced U.S. wheat to certain nations. Traders aredivided over whether the decision sets a precedent for theadministration to take similar action against China, which isa major importer of U.S. crops.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Futures prices rose. Coffee for March deliveryended at 72.25 cents a pound, up 2.1 cents. The activelytraded May contract rose 1.45 cents to 72.95 cents a pound.Analysts said futures prices were buoyed by a flurry ofshort-covering by commodity funds in advance of a meeting ofCentral American nations today in Costa Rica to discuss thepossibility of an international quota system. Traders covershort positions, or bets the price will fall, by buyingoffsetting contracts. &quot;It was quite an interesting daybecause for the first time {in weeks} it seemed like we had aturnaround in the market,&quot; said Celeste Georgakis, senioranalyst at Cargill Investor Services. Although prices didn'tmove above a major resistance level, Ms. Georgakis said, itwas encouraging that futures for May delivery managed toclose above 72 cents a pound. In the past, when coffee hasrallied, the advance has been stopped by producer selling atthe 72 cents level, Ms. Georgakis said. Judith Ganes, asenior analyst at Merrill Lynch, warned, however, that coffeefutures could fall as quickly as they rose. If the CentralAmerican nations fail to make any headway in persuadingholdout Brazil to discuss a quota system, futures prices willlikely retreat, Ms. Ganes said.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices rose. Sugar for May delivery endedat 8.27 cents a pound, up 0.23 cent. &quot;Ninety percent of{yesterday's} action in sugar was technical,&quot; said JamesSteel, an analyst at Refco in New York. Mr. Steel added that&quot;a fair amount of short-covering by commodity funds and somefresh buying by commission houses&quot; helped to lift sugarfutures. A report that Thailand will have a record sugar cropthis year was disregarded by traders, Mr. Steel said, becausethe news had been anticipated after Thailand said last weekit would have record sugar exports this year.</TEXT></DOC>
