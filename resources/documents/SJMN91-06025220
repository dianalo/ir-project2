Orange County increased by 24.7 percent to2,410,556.;    Hoag said most of the Inland Empire growth is attributed tocommuters who work in Los Angeles, Orange or San Diego counties, while a largecomponent of the growth in the Mother Lode counties is attributed to retirees,many of them from congested Southern California or the Bay Area.;    &quot;There'sa lot of out-migration from Southern California to other counties, especiallythe (Sierra Nevada) foothills,&quot; Hoag said.;    She said the fact thatRiverside, a large county, led the state in percentage growth &quot;is quiteunusual.
