Dennis M. Harrison, who has testified in prominent child custodycases across the nation, was charged Sept. 18 with three counts ofconspiracy to harbor or hide Travis Lee Meriweather of LexingtonPark.   Travis has been missing since a July 1987 visit to his father inHinton, Okla. Authorities believe he's being held by his fathersomewhere.   Harrison, the boy's grandfather, and a physician who hasexamined him, claim the father was justified in vanishing withTravis because he was virtually starved while in the care of hismother.   Some child abuse specialists say they are troubled by thegovernment's seizing of evidence _ handwritten notes and atelephone bill for a call to Hinton _ from Harrison's office andhome.   The records seizure and Harrison's arrest could have a``chilling effect'' on medical professionals who treat abusedchildren, said Dr. Eli Newberger, director of the FamilyDevelopment Study at Children's Hospital and an assistant professorof pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.   ``To have confidential knowledge about a client seized by thestate threatens the entire therapeutic enterprise,'' said JonConte, an associate professor of social work at the University ofChicago.   Harrison called his arrest an ``outrage.''   ``This sends an ominous message to health professionals who tryto help troubled kids from broken homes that they are standing onshaky, shaky legal ground,'' said Harrison, who is free on hisrecognizance and faces trial Feb. 7.   But D. Anne Emery, a St. Mary's County prosecutor, said she hasevidence that Harrison saw Travis at least twice knowing that stateand federal warrants had been issued for the boy and his father.   ``This is a situation where somebody who doesn't like theoutcome of the court order just takes the law into their own handsand does whatever he wants. It makes the very foundation of ourlegal system ineffective,'' she said.   The boy's grandfather, Leroy Meriweather of Hinton, Okla., saidTravis had grown increasingly thin while living with his mother,Terry Treadway, 27.   ``The baby had a bloated belly like those starving babies yousee on television in India and his hair was just falling out of hishead when it was brushed,'' he said.   Treadway won custody when she divorced her husband, Michael LeeMeriweather in Oklahoma in 1985. She moved to Maryland and agreedto let Travis spend a week each month with his father.   ``We've done just about everything we can do to find him and I'mall torn up inside,'' she said in an interview.   Dr. Donna Cosby, an Oklahoma City pediatrician who examinedTravis in 1986 and 1987, said he appeared to be underweight.   ``He would systematically lose up to a half a pound every timehe visited his mother, and gain it back when he was with his dad.Calories at that age are crucial to brain development, and kidsjust can't afford to have their weight bounce back and forth likethat,'' she said.   Treadway said Travis was perfectly healthy in her care.   ``Kids are kids and some of them don't have the figures thatadults might expect them to have,'' she said.   Harrison, 43, has testified on behalf of Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, aWashington, D.C., plastic surgeon who has been in jail for hidingher 7-year-old daughter, Hilary, from the courts since 1987. Morganhas alleged that the child's father, Dr. Eric Foretich, sexuallyabused the child, a claim Foretich denies.</TEXT></DOC>
