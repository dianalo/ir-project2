<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-92-0043 </DOCNO><TEXT>Honeywell is designing and developing an optimal supervisory controllerfor cool storage operation that will minimize the electric utility billfor cooling of commercial and institutional buildings using commonlyavailable cool storage systems, such as chilled water and ice storage.This paper provides a description of the elements of such a controlleralong with the performance results using simulated loads. A summary descriptionof the load prediction approach is provided, which is an important elementof the controller. A very good agreement between the predicted and actual(simulated) loads was achieved. Included are the results of the use ofthis optimal controller for different storage and chiller design sizesand a comparison of the optimal strategy with the currently used conventionalchiller and storage priority control. The controller features and a briefdescription of the controller are provided.</TEXT></DOC>
