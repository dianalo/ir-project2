The total cost of the jacking-up project was $286 million.    As previously reported, the Bartlesville, Okla.-based energy concern shut down production of the field Aug. 10 to raise the platforms 20 feet to make up for subsidence of the ocean floor. Phillips estimates the floor has subsided 12 feet since 1971. At one point, the company was reinjecting part of its production into the field to prevent the ocean floor from sinking further.    The company said the total cost of the elevation project, including lost production and other maintenance work, could reach $500 million to $600 million.    Phillips has a 37% interest in the field. The company said it plans to resume oil and natural gas production at the field around Sept. 7.    Phillips said its second-quarter production from the Ekofisk field averaged 49,000 barrels a day of crude oil, 9,000 barrels a day of natural gas liquids and 241 million cubic feet a day of natural gas. </TEXT></DOC>
