Marble, with more than $360 million in assets, will be the first Vermont bank purchased by a banking concern outside of New England, analysts said. The deal will close around Feb. 1, 1990, when national interstate banking become effective in Vermont.    The price will be determined by Marble's financial performance between now and the end of 1989. KeyCorp agreed to pay a base price of 1.2 times book value at the end of the quarter, if Marble's average return on equity is less than 8%. If Marble's return on equity is between 8% and 14%, KeyCorp will pay between 1.3 and 1.6 times book value.    George B. Williams, Marble's treasurer, said this pricing structure gives the bank &quot;an incentive to improve&quot; its return on equity.    If the deal closed now, its value would be $66.2 million, using the lowest base price KeyCorp has agreed on and Marble's $17.09-a-share book value at Dec. 31. KeyCorp can pay for the acquisition all in stock or with as much as 45% in cash.    On the news, Marble's shares leaped $3.75 to close at $15 a share in national over-the-counter trading. KeyCorp shares rose 37.5 cents to close at $21.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Shares of other banks in Vermont also advanced on the acquisition news.    KeyCorp, which has more than $11.6 billion in assets, also received a warrant to purchase as much as 24.9% of Marble's shares outstanding for $14 each, if another concern makes an offer for the Vermont bank before this deal is completed. </TEXT></DOC>
