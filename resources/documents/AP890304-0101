Snow plows were taken off some roads because of low visibility inblowing snow, and snow drifted back onto some highways as soon asplows passed.   Along the edge of the snow belt, thick fog slowed travel insoutheastern Wisconsin and delayed some morning flights at Chicago'sO'Hare airport.   ``It's total demolition out there,'' said a police dispatcher infog-bound Cedarburg, Wis. ``I hear the sheriff's department is goingcrazy with accidents.''   Southwestern Minnesota was hardest hit by the snow, with 18inches at Worthington, 16 at Wilmar and 15 at Fairmont.Minneapolis-St. Paul got an even foot of snow.   Plows attempted to keep major roads clear in the Worthingtonarea, according to the Nobles County sheriff's office, but snowdrifted back after the plows passed.   Roger Jakel, who runs Jake's Taxi Co. in Willmar, said hiscompany had made 75 calls as of midday Saturday with afour-wheel-drive taxi.   ``This morning it was really tough getting around. It was justdeep. We're using a four-wheel-drive for our taxi business to getthe nurses to work and people like that who had to go to work,''Jakel said.   ``Of course, now the plows have gone by and they're leaving abouta four-foot drift on the end of everybody's driveway, so now thestreets are getting fairly good but you can't get on them,'' headded.   At least three deaths were blamed on the weather in Minnesotasince the snow started Thursday, including one man found in a fieldwho apparently tried to walk for help after his car got stuck, theState Patrol said.   In South Dakota, Sioux Falls had 11.9 inches of snow in threedays and Huron got 12 inches.   Portions of Michigan's northern Lower Peninsula got an average of8 to 10 inches of snow, the National Weather Service said, withnumerous reports of snowdrifts up to 5 feet.   ``Of course it's a matter of opinion, but overall this is maybethe worst weather we've had all winter,'' said weather servicemeteorologist Gary Campbell in Ann Arbor, Mich.   Northern and central Wisconsin also got heavy snow, including 15inches at Blair and Altoona, 12 inches at Wausau and 11 at Green Bay.   Plowing was suspended for several hours during the night onInterstates 90 and 94 in central Wisconsin because blowing, driftingsnow cut visibility, said Ted Stephenson, maintenance supervisor forthe state Department of Transportation. Three plows were involved incollisions.   Southern Wisconsin got a mixture of freezing rain, sleet anddrizzle that glazed roads with more than an inch of ice in someareas. And ice brought down power lines throughout southernWisconsin, causing scattered power outages, utility officials said.   North-central Nebraska got 13 inches of snow at Chadron and 11 atValentine and Mullen, and some highways were closed or reduced toone-lane travel.   Rod Hall and his wife and two small children planned to leaveKearney, Neb., Saturday on a trip from Indiana to California afterspending two nights in a motel because of icy, snowy roads.   ``The traveling was just too treacherous,'' he said. ``You don'twant to be off in a ditch.''   ``I think must people have decided to stay put,'' said DaleneSkates, a motel clerk in North Platte, Neb. ``The wind is so bad itis really hard to drive. Most of the problem has been cars that havebeen blown into the ditch.''   Teeth rattled instead of snakes at Taylor, Texas, just northeastof Austin, where officials canceled the 17th annual NationalRattlesnake Sacking Championship because of a vicious cold front.The temperature fell 34 degrees in eight hours, to a reading of 34at noon Saturday.   Temperatures in Oklahoma were 50 to 60 degrees colder than onFriday, the weather service said.   The wind chill factor in Dallas shortly after noon was 9 belowzero. Several college sporting events were canceled.   The Six Flags Over Texas amusement park postponed its opening dayfor one week for the first time in its 29-year history, and sentworkers rushing to return flowers to warm greenhouses.   The cold also created icing problems at the Dallas-Fort Worthairport.   ``We have canceled approximately 50 percent of our flights forthe remainder of the day,'' said Mary O'Neill, spokeswoman forAmerican Airlines.</TEXT></DOC>
