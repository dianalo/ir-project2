Thus, capital costsshould be optimized consistent with the overall objective for the project.There are many project specific, technology and execution factors thatdetermine the capital cost for an LNG project. Thus, in order to significantlyreduce capital cost ana analysis must be made to determine &quot;where themoney is spent&quot;; then a concerted effort is made to reduce costs in allareas of plant design. For example, improvements in process, utility,offsite and equipment design will yield cost reductions that can be significant.Likewise, continued efforts in engineering execution such as modularengineering and 3D plant design result in added savings. In order tobe successful, all of these cost reduction concepts require excellentproject management with emphasis on up front planning and with effectiveexecution. In this manner, the overall objective of a safe, reliableand cost effective plant can be achieved.</TEXT></DOC>
