(MVEC).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Martin G. Seipel, Director, SouthwestArea_Electric, Room 0205, South Agriculture Building, Rural ElectrificationAdministration, Washington, DC 20250, telephone (202) 382-8848.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>REA, in conjunction with a requestfor financing assistance from MVEC, required that MVEC develop environmentalsupport information reflecting the potential environmental impacts of theproject. The information supplied by MVEC is contained in a Borrower'sEnvironmental Report (BER) which was used by REA to develop its EnvironmentalAssessment (EA). REA has concluded that the EA represents an accurate assessmentof the environmental impacts of the proposed project and that the impactsare acceptable.The proposed project consists of constructing approximately 95 kilometers(km) (59 mi) of new single circuit 138 kV transmission line and four new138/12.5 kV distribution substations and the rebuilding of 3.3 km (2.1mi) of existing 69 kV line to 138 kV. The line would originate at eitherthe Loma Alta Substation of the Brownsville Public Utility Board or theUnion Carbide Switching Station of Central Power andamp; Light Company andwould connect the proposed Highway 511-Kellers Corner, Central Avenue,Arroyo City and Burns Substations before terminating at MVEC's existingHeidelberg Substation. The majority of the single pole wood structureswould be routed parallel and adjacent to existing roads within a 15.3 meter(50 ft) right-of-way. Each of the four distribution substations would requireapproximately 0.8 hectare (2 ac) of land.REA has concluded that the proposed project will have no effect on primeforest land or rangeland, threatened or endangered species or criticalhabitat and properties listed or eligible for listing in the <T3>National Register of Historic Places</T3>. A maximum of 0.8 ha (2 ac)of important farmland could be impacted at the Arroyo City Substation site.Certain other impacts resulting from the proposed project are unavoidablesuch as the placement of a majority of the transmission structures in the100-year floodplain and routing the transmission line over small wetlandsand deepwater habitat. No other matters of environmental concern have cometo REA's attention.Alternatives examined for the proposed project included no action, energyconservation, alternative line routing and alternative substation sites.REA determined that there is a need for the proposed facilities and thatconstructing these facilities is recommended is an environmentally acceptablealternative for MVEC to increase system capacity, improve service reliabilityand reduce system power losses.Based upon the environmental support information provided, REA preparedan EA concerning the proposed project and its impacts. As a result of itsindependent evaluation, REA has concluded that approval of financing assistanceenabling MVEC to construct the proposed project would not constitute amajor Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.Therefore, REA has reached a FONSI with respect to the proposed project.The preparation of an environmental impact statement is not necessary.Copies of REA's EA and FONSI can be obtained from the offices of REA inthe South Agriculture Building, Room 0205, 14th and Independence AvenueSW., Washington, DC 20250; or at the office of Magic Valley Electric Cooperative,Inc.

For the reasonsset forth in final rule related notice to 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V, thisprogram is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requiresintergovernmental consultation with state and local officials.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: May 3, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John H.
