Both in our 30s, werealized the daily trek to the driveway was hardly enough exercise to keep useven semi-svelte. And, as former city dwellers, we were curious if South Baymass transit really deserved its bum rap.;    That's why we decided to trygetting around using only the bus, light rail, CalTrain, bikes and our own twofeet for seven days.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  FUEL FOR THOUGHT: TWO COMMUTERS TRY A WEEKOF MASS TRANSIT  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Ostrom is a Mercury News staff writer.

(Not that we needed war in the PersianGulf to drive the point home -- nonetheless it is a terrifying reminder of ourdependence on gas-guzzling autos.);    Now before we sound too self-righteous,we'll make two confessions: We hopped in a cab one night because we missed thelast bus, and we figured it wouldn't be much of a sacrifice to live auto-freefor a week.;    We don't have kids living with us and both our commutescombined are only a meager (by Bay Area standards) 24 miles a day. Everythingwe associate with survival -- the dry cleaners, 7-Eleven, video rental storeand automatic teller machine -- are within a 10-minute walk. The bus stop isonly 135 steps from our East San Jose home, even fewer if our quickly trainedears picked up the roar of a bus engine approaching.;    And we were a bitcocky, having survived New York subways for four and a half years -- with justone chain snatching to report.;    But this story is about much more than masstransit. It's about reassessing priorities, striking up new, unusualrelationships and finding out about the place we call home.;    We made allthe mistakes worthy of any novice bus rider, including misreading schedulesand taking a route recommended by a Santa Clara County Transit scheduleadviser. (She forgot to tell us that every driver on the route that stopsclosest to our house takes a mandated 20-minute break just a mile down theroad.);    The result: On the first day, a trip that is usually 12 minutes bycar turned into a one-hour-and-43-minute ride. One of us was 45 minutes lateto work, the other missed an hour of class.;    But then, with the invaluablehelp of Aristeo Canales, who answered our distress call to county transit'shot line -- the bus rider's version of 911 -- the time was reduced to analmost remarkable 45 minutes. On an average weekday, Canales and hiscolleagues answer some 3,400 calls.;    By the third day, with hot-line numbercommitted to memory, riding the bus became second nature. We kept a roll ofquarters by the phone. Bus routes 71, 36 and 59 became as recognizable ashighways 101, 880 and 280.;    Mass-transit myths;  Besides daily trips to theMercury News and Evergreen Valley College, we used the bus to go to ValleyFair and Eastridge malls and to a friend's house in Santa Clara to watch asporting event on TV (we almost missed the game's exciting end as we had tocatch the bus home). We rode light rail to the San Jose Real Estate Boarddinner-dance at the Red Lion Hotel (that's when we cheated with the cabbecause our bus stopped running at 7:30 p.m. on Saturdays), and took CalTrainto Sunday brunch at MacArthur Park in Palo Alto.;    Sure, spending a week onbuses and trains reinforced some old stereotypes about mass transit. But manymyths were dashed.;    Yes, the buses are slow and noisy, but at least it'snot your blood pressure that rises when a jerk swerves through traffic.;   Yes, many buses come only once every 45 minutes to an hour. Quickly, youdevelop a dependency on the minute hand of your watch.;    Yes, one of us wasleft standing at a stop for 45 minutes because a bus broke down, somethingthat as the county transit's fleet ages apparently is happening with moreregularity. (Personally speaking, however, we can hardly crow about our 1982Mustang's record.);    No, the buses do not always run behind schedule -- infact, sometimes they are early (which can be worse than running late if theydon't wait).;    No, the bus drivers are not all clones of Ralph Kramden. Theywish you good night, help passengers with grocery bags and, in one case, gaveimpromptu English lessons to a Spanish-speaking regular passenger.;    40seats, no standing;  Mass, we found out however, is a misnomer. It's notuncommon to share a 40-seat bus or a light-rail car with just one or twoothers. (We find it hard to believe Santa Clara County Transit, which says144,000 people, or 10 percent of the county's population, ride the busweekdays.);    Some of us are forever addicted to the fast lane, but life onmass transit has its rewards, too.;    After spending more than two yearslooking at San Jose mostly through a car windshield, sitting with strangersfosters a sense of community and allows conversations you'd ordinarily neverhave -- a neighborhood deli on wheels, if you will.;    We had conversationswith strangers about Middle East goings-on and learned how to listen to (or atleast tolerate) rap music. We even made a new friend, a 24-year-oldengineering student from Mexico who is here to learn English -- and willing tohelp us with our halting Spanish.;    Instead of blaring the all-news stationon the car radio, it's refreshing to become engrossed in a book or justdaydream out the window (as long as one remembers to get off at the right stop-- another mistake made early on.);    Just walking to and from the bus (ahealthy two miles, counting both ends), we came to recognizeinteresting-looking people and scenery we'd previously whizzed by.;    Not todigress, but walking is an important part of the mass-transit experiencearound here. Walkers, at least in our little patch of suburbia, are treated assecond-class citizens -- even though they rightly can claim endangered-speciesstatus.;    Bushes and cars routinely block sidewalks. One can barely pass ahouse without riling cats and dogs -- and then their owners who rush outside-- or setting off motion-detecting lights that diligently guard driveways atnight. Since when are sidewalks private property?;    Rolling stops byinattentive drivers are life-threatening, and those yellow-tinted streetlightsare positively useless.;    Nevertheless, both of us not only survived butalso came to enjoy the regimen.;    And not a moment too soon, as the quest tomake mass transit compatible with all of our lives will take on more urgency.Bay Area planners say that to coax people out of their cars in order to meetfederal air-quality standards, by the 21st century we can expect to pay topark at work and shell out $5 for bridge tolls.;    With gas hitting $1.40 agallon at times over the last few months, spending $1.50 a day for unlimitedtravel on Santa Clara County Transit buses and light rail makes economicsense.;    Our verdict after the one-week trial is that mass transit, withperseverance and patience, is feasible. Not every day or every place.;    Buthere's a challenge. Take mass transit or walk or bike somewhere you usuallydrive, just one time each week.;    You might be surprised.
