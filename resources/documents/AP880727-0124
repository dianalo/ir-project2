(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former town judge should be barred fromjudicial office for life for soliciting oral sex from a defendantand threatening to have her dog killed if she told, a statejudicial watchdog panel said Wednesday.   The woman was trying to pay a $10 fine for letting her dog runloose when the judge said he'd give her $25 for a sex act, said thestate Commission on Judicial Conduct.   The woman threw a $10 bill at the judge and refused his offer,the commission said.   The judge, Gerald Molnar, 29, was a $2,500-a-year part-time townjustice in Madrid, near the St. Lawrence River on the border withCanada, at the time. He resigned last April 26, a day before thecommission held a hearing on the case.   The panel recommended to the state Court of Appeals, New York'shighest court, that Molnar be prohibited from holding judicialoffice again because of the May 1, 1987, incident.   Molnar, a food service worker at the state's OgdensburgCorrectional Facility, has 30 days to appeal.   Molnar did not submit any defense during the commission'shearings, the panel said. Molnar's lawyer, Duncan MacAffer, was onvacation and couldn't be reached for comment, said a secretary atMacAffer's office in Albany.   The judicial panel saidturday.   The survey, reported Tuesday by radio station WEEI in Boston,found Dukakis with 54 percent support to 37 percent for Bush. Thepoll reflected the frequent bounce enjoyed by presidentialcandidates after their nominating conventions.   Nine percent were undecided in the survey, which had a margin oferror of four points.</TEXT></DOC>
