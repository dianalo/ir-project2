Expects 1988 Profit To Top Last Year's </HL><SO> </SO><CO> CSN </CO><IN> CEO </IN><DATELINE> CINCINNATI  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Cincinnati Bell Inc. expects 1988 profit to surpass last year's $64.4 million, or $2.01 a share, Dwight H. Hibbard, chairman and chief executive officer, said.    Mr. Hibbard didn't make a more specific forecast or indicate how much the core Cincinnati Bell Telephone unit would contribute to profit. Last year, that unit earned $64.6 million, and contributed $539.9 million of the parent's $633.8 million in revenue, in effect supporting newer, faster-growing and less-regulated businesses.    Recently, basic phone operations have been restructured, producing a leaner, more efficient business, Mr. Hibbard said. For example, the manager group was sheared by about 50%. No more big workforce cutbacks are planned, he said.    Cincinnati Bell hopes to stimulate revenue growth for telephone operations by offering more services and introducing a new line of leased telephone equipment, Mr. Hibbard said in an interview. New services to be offered include a home-intercom phone system and a distinctive ringing service. With the latter, parents would know when a telephone call was for them and when it was for their children.    Meanwhile, diversification efforts have emphasized information systems. Last year, revenue for that division rose 100% to nearly $110 million; the operations didn't contribute much to profit.    Two niches that the unit finds attractive are monthly billing services for cellular telephone operations in the U.S. and Canada and automated billings systems for foreign governments. The division has captured about 70% of the cellular billing market, which exceeds one million customers and &quot;is growing 5% a month,&quot; Mr. Hibbard said. </TEXT></DOC>
