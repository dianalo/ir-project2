The African leaders are negotiating to end a 12-year war thathas cost hundreds of thousands of lives and made half ofMozambique's 14.7 million people wholly or partly dependent on foodaid.   Mugabe said he expects to contact Moi ``in the next few days''to arrange preliminary talks with officials of the rebel MozambiqueNational Resistance, also known by the Portuguese acronym RENAMO.   The peace initiative, headed by Moi, aims at bringing theguerrillas to a conference table with representatives of PresidentJoaquim Chissano's Marxist-oriented government, Mugabe said.   ``We are looking forward to cooperation by RENAMO, as muchcooperation as possible,'' he told reporters Friday, a day afterhis return from an Organization of African Unity summit in AddisAbaba, Ethiopia.   ``We hope eventually there will be direct contact between theMozambique government and Renamo. It is these two parties that mustnegotiate a settlement to their problems,'' he said.   Mozambican rebels have been fighting for 12 years to oust theMaputo government and are accused of widespread atrocities. Theyare considered right-wing because they used to be armed by SouthAfrica, but their political goals are unclear.   Mugabe said Chissano asked him on July 10 to join Moi as amediator to end the fighting that, coupled with mismanagement and aweak infrastructure inherited from Portuguese colonizers, hasplaced Mozambique among the world's poorest nations.   Mugabe met with Moi at the African summit and the two agreed to``draft parameters on the way we hope to operate'' and comparenotes soon afterward, Mugabe said.   He said a meeting with Mozambican rebel officials will follow,but gave no details.   Landlocked Zimbabwe has 12,000 troops fighting alongsideMozambican government forces and guarding transport links and anoil pipeline through Mozambique to the Indian Ocean.   The proposed rapprochement follows a U.S.-brokered peace accordfor southern African involving independence for Namibia and thewithdrawal of South African and Cuban troops in Angola.   Until the June 22 cease-fire between Angola's government andJonas Savimbi's U.S.-backed rebels, Zimbabwe opposed similarnegotiations in Mozambique.   At first, the Mozambican rebels rejected Mugabe as too partisanto mediate. But earlier this month they accepted his role in thepeace initiative.   Chissano's government is debating negotiations with the rebelsat the annual congress of its ruling Front for the Liberation ofMozambique, the country's sole legal political party.   The congress Friday presented a new policy document that dropsall references to Marxism, Leninism and Western imperialism. But itsays the party remains committed to socialism.   The alterations coincide with a new government drive to endcentral control of the economy and reflects Maptuo's improvingrelations with Western countries such as the United States, Italyand Britain.</TEXT></DOC>
