RobertAbboud's 1988 rescue of First City Bancorp of Texas,Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc. presented the new boss witha football-shaped trophy bearing his oft-repeated bankingphilosophy: &quot;All it takes is basic blocking and tackling.&quot;   The image seemed apt. Weighing a combined quarter-ton, Mr.Abboud's trusted aides, Frank C. Cihak and Robert D. Richley,looked like Chicago Bears linemen. And what a coach they hadin Bob Abboud. Tenacious and widely viewed as anultra-conservative lender, the Harvard-educated formerchairman of First Chicago Corp. seemed just the man to leadan investor group in a federally assisted takeover of theailing First City and to guide it back to solid lendingpractices.</LP><TEXT>   But now, Mr. Abboud's team has fumbled. Yesterday, in atacit admission that his recapitalization plan grosslyunderestimated the amount of federal assistance needed torefloat First City, the company created a big reserve forpotential losses from bad assets and reported afourth-quarter net loss of $166.3 million.   The loss for all 1990 totaled $158.3 million, comparedwith earnings of $112.2 million in 1989. Although there isn'tany sign that First City is on the brink of failure, it saysit is &quot;preparing capital-enhancement plans&quot; for the holdingcompany and for its Houston and Dallas banks. Meanwhile, thecompany's stock closed at $2.875 on the New York StockExchange yesterday, down 12.5 cents on the day, and off 90%from its high of $39.50 in late 1989.   First City attributes its problems primarily to theweakening real-estate market, which has been flooded withproperty from other Texas financial institutions also rescuedby the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and by the ResolutionTrust Corp., the federal agency chartered to clean up thesavings and loan mess. This, coupled with the drought offinancing, has devalued the assets held by Collecting BankN.A., the First City affiliate set up at the time of therecapitalization to liquidate the predecessor bank's badloans.   &quot;If you take Collecting Bank out of the equation . . .First City's fine,&quot; Mr. Abboud says in an interview.   But he and his associates aggravated the problems at the&quot;clean&quot; bank, too. A close examination of First City suggeststhat, for a long period, it was virtually running amok. Farfrom tightening First City's purse strings, the new managersspent millions of dollars on perquisites. To meetoverambitious earnings forecasts, they gambled on high-riskloans. And, in the grand tradition of Texas Sandamp;Ls, they lentlarge sums to people who did them favors.   &quot;Even though senior management weren't native Texans,good-old-boyism was apparently alive and well&quot; at First City,says Sandra Flannigan, a securities analyst at Alex. Brown andamp;Sons in Baltimore.   Now, perhaps belatedly, the First City board is trying tofind out the extent of any mutual back-scratching. At Mr.Abboud's recommendation, the board has engaged the Houstonlaw firm of Baker andamp; Botts to investigate loans andexpenditures made by Mr. Cihak before he resigned lastOctober as vice chairman, according to people familiar withthe inquiry. These people say the investigators are lookinginto whether Mr. Cihak benefited personally from anytransactions. On Tuesday, First City terminated, withoutexplanation, his $450,000-a-year consulting contract.   Mr. Cihak declines to comment on the record. His lawyer,Daniel T. Hartnett, says Mr. Cihak &quot;did not benefit from anymoney paid to consultants.&quot; In an earlier letter, theattorney expressed concern that an &quot;untruthful article&quot; mightbe printed about his client and warned that First City mightunfairly be turning Mr. Cihak into a &quot;sacrificial offering tothe idol of corporate expediency.&quot;   Expediency may have damaged First City. When Mr. Abboudtook over, he said the bank was a pure play on the recoveringTexas economy. But the bank's free-wheeling lending has stuckit with some unusual, far-away assets. Thanks to an extensiverelationship with Gene Phillips, the deposed head ofSouthmark Corp., First City has a fourth lien on an aging LasVegas hotel and casino. In another case, a $140 millionnonperforming credit is secured by art work and real estatein Spain.   The bad news couldn't come at a worse time for the FDIC,which has already bailed out First City once with $920million in assistance and now has its hands full trying toshore up an array of troubled banks.   However, some observers blame the FDIC in part for FirstCity's problems. They say it cut a deal offering too littlefederal aid. They add that a rival bid for the ailing bankfrom the Mandell family of Chicago requested $1.4 billion inassistance, and the Bank of Scotland is understood to havesought at least $1.2 billion.   &quot;We accepted what the marketplace decided they wanted topay,&quot; a senior FDIC official says in response to thecriticism, adding that &quot;we certainly didn't&quot; have any reasonto think the resulting institution would be &quot;unsound.&quot;   In the first year or two after the bailout, outsiders hadlittle reason to deem it anything short of a total success.In addition to the FDIC assistance, Mr. Abboud raised $500million in private capital and boasted that the bank was &quot;onplan and on time.&quot; He and his team were praised forenergizing lackluster loan officers, making them call morefrequently on clients. The bank also rolled out severalinnovative consumer-banking products, such as a computerizedhome-banking service.   With many other Texas banks flat on their backs, FirstCity aggressively expanded its market share and increased itsdeposits. It also rang up healthy profits, earning $4.26 ashare, fully diluted, in 1989.   But the 61-year-old Mr. Abboud has a dark side. During hisstormy tenure at the helm of First Chicago from 1975 to 1980,Mr. Abboud's abrasive style helped get him fired. Andalthough he tried to soften his image at First City, he stillmanaged to spread terror through the ranks. Former employeesrecall that he fired one longtime executive just two hoursbefore the man was to hold a party for his staff and thenordered the party to continue anyway.   Sometimes, Mr. Abboud's legendary ego seemed just too bigfor First City, whose $14 billion in assets ranks it just43rd in size among U.S. bank holding companies. He bought twocorporate jets and set out on globe-girdling tours to call onpeople such as Li Peng, China's premier, and Saddam Husseinof Iraq. Mr. Abboud was determined to make trade finance oneof First City's cornerstones, even while most U.S. banks werepulling back from international business.   Meantime, his competitors rubbed their hands. Theybelieved that he was spending too much time roaming the worldin search of business while neglecting his customers at home.But the biggest shortcoming of Mr. Abboud and his associateswas their penchant for booking out-of-state loans with littleoversight from colleagues.   These credits, moreover, frequently had the aura offavoring people or institutions that had helped the Abboudgroup at one time or another. For example, Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc., which rescued the Abboud group's flaggingefforts to raise capital by underwriting a $125 million issueof preferred stock, later got a $25 million loan from FirstCity.   &quot;It's natural that there was an obligation there,&quot; saysFrank Anderson, an analyst at Stephens Inc., of Little Rock,Ark. He thinks that the Drexel loan was sound when made butthat First City, unlike many other senior Drexel creditors,erred in not forcing repayment before the investment-bankingfirm entered bankruptcy proceedings. Mr. Abboud has deniedthat the loan to Drexel was a quid pro quo.   Meanwhile, Mr. Abboud's vice chairman was pursuing someout-of-market credits of his own. Of all the players in theFirst City drama, the 48-year-old Mr. Cihak is described bythe people involved as the most enigmatic. A former amateurboxer who told associates he was reared in an orphanage onChicago's tough South Side, Mr. Cihak served as a commoditieslender at First Chicago until 1976. He later emerged as asenior officer of a number of small Midwestern banks owned bya Chicago investor group.   Mr. Cihak's tenure as chairman of one such institution,the Bank of Commerce of Morristown, Tenn., was controversial.Knowledgeable persons say the Federal Bureau of Investigationis looking into certain loans that the bank made to financethe sale of partnerships in thoroughbred horses by LloydSwift, a close associate of Mr. Cihak, between 1984 and 1986.Mr. Cihak's attorney says, &quot;There is no way he is either thesubject or the target of the investigation.&quot; Mr. Swift, aformer Missouri horse breeder, says he isn't underinvestigation, either.   Although Mr. Cihak wasn't close to Mr. Abboud at FirstChicago, an Abboud adviser says his success at the Midwesternbanks, coupled with good reviews from the FDIC, brought Mr.Cihak to the attention of Mr. Abboud's group as it plottedits First City takeover. Mr. Cihak eventually joined Mr.Abboud in a partnership that borrowed $39.8 million fromDonaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette to buy First City stock.   Mr. Cihak worked long hours in his apartment at Houston'sFour Seasons Hotel, where both he and Mr. Richley, the bank'spresident, lived at First City expense. &quot;Frank operated a lotfrom his hotel room, and he had a couple of lines and theyrang all night,&quot; one associate says.   Among other things, Mr. Cihak hired a raft of consultants,many of them old friends and business associates drawn by thelucrative fees that First City spread around. Formeremployees say one such consultant was paid about a milliondollars for selling off foreign debt on the secondary market,while Mr. Swift was put in charge of selling First City'srepossessed automobiles. Mr. Swift says that besides thefees, he received loans from First City totaling about$900,000, and he concedes that he fell behind on interestpayments before the loans were paid off.   In addition, I. Stephan Bloch, who had worked yearsearlier with Mr. Cihak at the Midwest Stock Exchange, wasbrought in to organize First City's computer system. FirstCity recently filed in state court in Houston a lawsuitcharging Mr. Bloch and his Maryland-based Banner Corp. withfraud, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. Itcontends that they raked in $10 million by &quot;substantially andrepeatedly&quot; overbilling the bank and causing First City tohire outside contractors with whom Banner and Mr. Bloch &quot;hadeconomic or other relationships.&quot; The suit seeks more than $5million in damages.   Mr. Bloch's attorney denies any wrongdoing, and Banner issuing First City for alleged breach of contract.   But what has attracted the most attention is Mr. Cihak'sown lending activities. Early on in the recapitalization,people involved say, it became apparent internally that FirstCity would have to go beyond nickel-and-dime commercial loansin the still-depressed Texas market if it was to meet itsambitious earnings projections. And Mr. Cihak obliged.   So, too, did Gene Phillips, the former chairman ofSouthmark, once the highest-flying real-estate syndicator inthe country. A knowledgeable person says the Abboud team'sfirst contact with Mr. Phillips came in early 1988, before heleft Southmark amid charges of self-dealing.   Mr. Cihak, who had met Mr. Phillips years earlier at theKentucky Derby, called the executive with an 11th-hourrequest for financing from Southmark's troubled San JacintoSavings Association unit, the knowledgeable person says,adding that Mr. Cihak quipped: &quot;It would be some kind ofsymbolic poetry to have a problem Sandamp;L bail out a problembank.&quot;   San Jacinto agreed to a $68 million loan, which First Cityquickly repaid. Then, in 1989, Mr. Phillips, who had justleft Southmark, came to First City with loan requests forseveral real estate investment trusts he still controlled.&quot;After leaving Southmark with all the publicity, borrowingwas not an easy job for any entity related to me,&quot; Mr.Phillips concedes.   Indeed, one former and one current First City executivesay they tried to block a Phillips credit, worried, amongother things, about the possibility that it would look likepayback. But other executives, Mr. Cihak included,successfully argued that collateral was more than sufficient.   Whatever the case, First City's Dallas bank agreed on June29, 1989, to provide American Realty Trust, a Phillips REIT,a $25 million working-capital line of credit and a $7 millionproject loan, which was later consolidated in a $36 millionworking-capital line, according to the REIT's year-end publicfiling.   The June 29 funding was followed by a flurry oftransactions. On June 30, American Realty bought, for $2million, a 20% stake in a joint venture with First City thathad interests in five other joint ventures that own land inDallas and Houston. At the time, those ventures were indefault on a $36 million loan from First City-Dallas. But theloan was brought current after American Realty started paying$340,000 a month to its venture with First City.   Also on June 30, another Phillips real-estate trust,Vinland Property Trust, bought a $1.15 million mortgage fromFirst City on Mr. Swift's former horse farm in Carrollton,Mo. That note, owed by another associate of Mr. Cihak,Illinois horse breeder Don Cochonour, has fallen past due.Vinland says that a recent appraisal values the property atjust $300,000 and that it is pressing Mr. Cihak to make goodon a personal guarantee to bolster collateral. Mr. Swift sayshe thinks the property is worth much more than $300,000.   Meanwhile, apparently as partial security for the AmericanRealty loan, First City has obtained a fourth lien for $4.6million on the Continental Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.   Mr. Cihak appears to have gambled on other loans, too.Through a Middle Eastern friend of Mr. Abboud's, First Citylearned of a business opportunity with the Coca family ofSpain. Despite owning millions of dollars in fine art andreal estate, the aristocratic family owed a huge sum to aSpanish bank and faced a forced sale of certain assets at alow price, a family member says.   First City came to the rescue, arranging for Citicorp'sSpanish bank to take out the Cocas' other lender with a $100million-plus loan backstopped by a First City letter ofcredit, people familiar with the deal say. The loan was tohave been repaid through asset sales, many of which FirstCity believed had already been arranged.   But the expected sales fell through, and First City wasforced to make good on the letter of credit, leaving it witha loan now totaling some $140 million.   The loan went into default almost immediately -- but Mr.Cihak had another maneuver in the works. Trying to providethe Cocas with money for an interest payment, Mr. Cihakarranged for First City to lend Kentucky horse breeder andFirst City borrower J.T. Lundy several million dollars topurchase two paintings, including a Picasso, from the Cocas,the insiders say. But First City is still trying to sell theCocas' main real-estate assets in the midst of a rapidlysoftening market.   At least things are looking up for a big loan made toCalumet Farm Inc., which Mr. Lundy manages. According to deedrecords in Lexington, Ky., First City's loan commitments toCalumet, once the citadel of American horse breeding, total$44.75 million.   According to another person who lent money to the farm,the slump in the thoroughbred industry caused a cash pinch atCalumet and imperiled interest payments on the First Citycredit. Then, Calumet's prize stallion, Alydar, kicked itsstall door and broke a leg. While unfortunate for horsebreeding, the accident proved lucky for First City: AfterAlydar was destroyed, insurance proceeds helped service thebank debt. Mr. Lundy couldn't be reached for comment.   Meanwhile, First City's recent troubles have promptedcalls from some investors for Mr. Abboud to bow out. But Mr.Abboud says he hasn't any intention of leaving, noting: &quot;Ihave a personal and professional and financial interest inthe long-term future of this bank.&quot;   Part of that future, he says, will involve a substantialreduction of First City's total assets and a wholesaleretreat from operations beyond Texas's borders, including hispet international businesses. First City plans to refocus itsefforts on such strengths as energy lending and trustoperations. &quot;We're very much de-emphasizing real estate,&quot; Mr.Abboud adds.   They're also tightening credit procedures, giving moreoversight to credit committees, Mr. Abboud says, and slashingcosts. This means consolidating back-office functions,selling the corporate jets and doing away with company carsfor officers, among other things. &quot;Everybody flies economy,&quot;he says. &quot;We are going to watch pennies from top to bottom.&quot;   ---                     Abboud's Bank Woes                                                                                                          Banks ranked by operating expenses as a percent of totalassets, as of Sept. 30, 1990.
