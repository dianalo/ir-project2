Among the technological factors, the typeof the lining and the grinding bodies of the ball mill has an exceptionalinfluence. It was shown that there is a regular relationship betweenthe chemical nature of the solid phase, the production technology ofHCBS, the state of the dispersion medium (fixed and free states), andthe rheological properties. This relationship determines the bindingproperties of such systems to a large extent. The factor of the chemicalnature of the solid phase (characterized by the ionic potential IP) formsthe basis for the suggested classification. They classified HCBS basedon acidic, acidic-amphoteric, amphoteric, and basic materials. The specificfeatures of the groups of HCBS were formulated. They obtained HCBS ofacidic and acidic-amphoteric compositions having the following characteristics:porosity 9-18% and {sigma}/sub bnd/ after drying 2-10 N/mm{sup 2} andafter strengthening 40-80 N/mm{sup 2}.</TEXT></DOC>
