David who? David Smick, a one-time congressional aide whonow turns gossip about world finance into gold.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Smick and his partner, Manuel Johnson, the former Fedvice chairman, practice what Mr. Johnson calls &quot;informationarbitrage.&quot; They cozy up to movers-and-shakers, swappingwhispers from Washington for tidbits from Tokyo; advertisetheir conversations with top government officials; and selltheir gleanings to corporate clients for annual retainerssometimes running into six figures.   Because they make sure that very important people knowthey talk to other very important people, Mr. Smick and Mr.Johnson occasionally move markets. Just last week, JohnsonSmick International Inc. sent bond prices tumbling with wordthat the Fed's &quot;high command&quot; had concluded the economy mightgrow more than anticipated in coming months -- even thoughFed Chairman Alan Greenspan had stated this publicly daysbefore. And in April, bond prices fell after Mr. Johnson andMr. Smick said a &quot;brutal confrontation&quot; between Mr. Greenspanand his colleagues made further interest-rate cuts &quot;highlyunlikely . . . for now.&quot; Never mind that four weeks later,the Fed pushed rates down a bit.   It was classic Smick: a hint of inside information, atouch of fiction and a prediction based on the politics ofpolicy-making. &quot;I'm not an expert in any of this stuff,&quot; heconcedes. The firm's niche isn't economic analysis but rathera claim to understand the people making policy. &quot;I listen asa political analyst,&quot; Mr. Smick says. &quot;We sell radar,&quot; saysMr. Johnson.   The radar has a mixed record. In March 1989, the firm saidNoburu Takeshita would quit as prime minister of Japan in twoweeks. Close: He did in four. But later, it predicted anotherJapanese prime minister, Toshiki Kaifu, wouldn't last when hetook office; he now seems sure to complete a full two-yearterm.   No matter. Clients don't set terribly high standards fortipsters. &quot;They're right more often than they are wrong,&quot;says Stanley Druckenmiller, a customer who works for New Yorkinvestor George Soros. And even Mr. Smick admits thatcomplete accuracy isn't essential in his business. &quot;If you're55% to 60% right, you're gold,&quot; he says.   Access is the secret to the firm's success -- as well as asource of controversy. Mr. Smick, an inveterate name dropper,boasts of talking frequently with officials in Tokyo,Frankfurt and Washington, people whose words can be worthsmall fortunes in financial markets. The officials confirmtalking to him, but deny leaking any secrets. &quot;They are verygood friends of mine,&quot; says Makoto Utsumi, a powerful viceminister of finance in Japan, who says he often speaks to Mr.Smick and Mr. Johnson.   When Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was inWashington recently, Mr. Smick and Mr. Johnson took himsailing on the Chesapeake. When the pair were in Frankfurt,Karl Otto Poehl, head of the German Bundesbank, had them todinner at his house. Some top Fed and Bush administrationofficials also talk regularly with them. Whatever theofficials say is quickly passed on -- hidden behind phrasessuch as &quot;senior U.S. officials&quot; -- to clients, many of themeager to profit from that information in financial markets.   Mr. Smick is &quot;a horse trader,&quot; says Harold Malmgren, aconsultant and former trade negotiator. &quot;If he can give yousome information, he will. He hopes you will pass onsomething useful.&quot;   Mr. Johnson says government officials talk to them becausethey want to hear what the two have picked up from others. Heshould know. While at the Fed, he talked to Mr. Smick and hisformer partner, Richard Medley, occasionally joining them forbreakfast. &quot;They moved around a lot. Talking with them wasuseful,&quot; Mr. Johnson says. Aware of their consultingbusiness, he says he was always &quot;guarded&quot; and talked &quot;purelyon background about the economy.&quot; That didn't stop the twoconsultants from passing on to clients whatever they gleaned.   The Fed hasn't any specific rules on which individualsboard members can talk to. &quot;I don't provide information topeople who are trading, and I would put someone who iswriting a private {news}letter in that same category,&quot; saysone board member, Wayne Angell. But he says he has had dinnerat Mr. Smick's house and has spoken at a conference sponsoredby Mr. Smick's firm.   On several occasions, Mr. Smick has even managed to gethis clients literally inside the corridors of power. He hasacted as host at events not only in the State Department'sBenjamin Franklin room but also at Fed headquarters, despitepolicies at both intended to bar use by profit-makingbusinesses.   The stately surroundings lend the activities an officialsheen. In Moscow, Grigory Yavlinsky, a prominent adviser toRussian President Boris Yeltsin, opened an envelope and &quot;wasamazed to find . . . an invitation from the U.S. Departmentof State to attend a session of the Group of SevenConsultative Council,&quot; according to an interview in MoscowNews. After conferring with aides to Mr. Yeltsin and toSoviet President Gorbachev, Mr. Yavlinsky showed up and, inhis words, was granted &quot;the status of participant&quot; at theSmick-sponsored event.   All this was too much for Treasury Secretary NicholasBrady and his top international aide, Undersecretary DavidMulford. They objected to the State Department's lending itsstature to a meeting of a private group with anofficial-sounding name. And rivalry between Treasury andState over international economics was fueled when Secretaryof State James Baker agreed to preside at the openingluncheon. (Because of his Mideast travels, he didn't make it,but Undersecretary Robert Kimmitt did.) After Treasuryofficials voiced concern, some U.S. officials, including Mr.Greenspan and chief White House economist Michael Boskin,suddenly found themselves too busy to participate.   But not many people boycotted the April event. The two-dayconference, sponsored by a Smick-Johnson creation called the&quot;G-7 Council,&quot; opened with a speech by former -- and perhapsfuture -- Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita, and closed witha luncheon address by the Bundesbank president, Mr. Poehl.Listening were about 250 people, many of them friends,sources, clients or potential clients of Johnson SmickInternational.   Mr. Smick and Mr. Johnson formed the G-7 Council last yearas an unofficial counterpart to the official G-7 -- the topeconomic officials from the U.S., Japan, Germany, Britain,France, Italy and Canada. A who's who of former officials,economists and executives, the G-7 Council has a statedpurpose of fostering international coordination of economicpolicies.   A brochure distributed last September at the inaugural G-7Council reception at the Fed listed a steering committee. Butsome of those listed say they didn't even know at the timethat they were on the committee. Beryl Sprinkel, who wasPresident Reagan's economic adviser, and Wendy Dobson, aformer deputy finance minister in Canada, say they didn'tlearn of their membership until a news reporter told themthis spring. Mr. Smick says both were asked in advance.   Although even some participants regard it as an extensionof the Johnson-Smick consulting business, the G-7 Council istechnically a nonprofit entity and, as such, was permitted tohold its September reception at the Fed and its April meetingat the State Department's headquarters, complete with flagsof the G-7 countries and simultaneous translators.   Mr. Johnson strenuously objects to any suggestion that theG-7 Council is simply a ploy to bolster the firm's business.&quot;The G-7 Council is totally separate from the firm. We don'ttake any salary,&quot; he says. &quot;It's no different than DavidRockefeller having a role in the Trilateral Commission andthe Council on Foreign Relations.&quot;   But not even some of their fans see it that way. &quot;They areorganizers. They have a business interest. You need both,&quot;says Norbert Walter, the chief economist at Deutsche Bank.   Mr. Smick, now 37 years old, began his career on CapitolHill at the age of 21, working for the late Texas RepublicanSen. John Tower. Later, he worked for Jack Kemp, then aRepublican congressman from New York state. After anunsuccessful run for Congress from his native Baltimore in1984, Mr. Smick joined forces with Mr. Medley. Withcharacteristic boldness, Mr. Smick and Mr. Medley calledtheir first joint effort &quot;a congressional summit&quot; on exchangerates and persuaded Sen. Bill Bradley, Democrat of NewJersey, and Mr. Kemp to sponsor it.   The timing was terrific, two months after the watershedaccord between the U.S. and its allies to drive down thevalue of the dollar. When then-Secretary of the TreasuryJames Baker showed up at the forum, the event elevated Mr.Smick and Mr. Medley from anonymity and sparked a series ofsimilar events. Sen. Bradley subsequently dubbed them the&quot;Barnum and Bailey of international economics.&quot;   In 1987, Mr. Smick and Mr. Medley launched a glossymagazine, called International Economy, that provided onemore way to stroke official egos and make friends for theconsulting business. After American Express Co. hired the twoto advise its chairman, James Robinson, on promoting his planfor solving the Third World debt problem, the magazinepublished an essay on the plan under his byline.   Not everyone on Mr. Robinson's payroll appreciated theseoutsiders. &quot;People would say to Robinson: `Do you really knowthese guys?'&quot; recalls Harry Freeman, a lobbyist and formerAmerican Express executive. &quot;He would say: `I don't care.They produce.'&quot; (The magazine also helps the duo courtjournalists, including, in the past, some from The WallStreet Journal, by paying them for free-lance articles.)   Mr. Smick's biggest coup was to persuade Mr. Johnson, 42,the respected former Fed vice chairman, to reject a lucrativeoffer from Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and join the consulting firmafter Mr. Medley left last fall to form a securities firm.Some White House officials say Mr. Johnson's move reduces hischances of ever becoming Fed chairman.   Mr. Johnson forswears any immediate interest in that jobbut doubts his chances of getting it someday have been hurt.&quot;There's more to the job {of Fed chairman} than just havingto play by those conventions all the time,&quot; he says. &quot;Maybe Idon't fit the mold with the stuffed shirts. If that's what ittakes to be considered for that {job}, I wasn't cut out forit.&quot;   Avoiding Wall Street firms, however, probably hasn't hurtMr. Johnson's income, he says. Goldman Sachs became a clientof Johnson Smick International. Mr. Smick and Mr. Johnsonwon't discuss what they earn or what they charge clients. Butshortly after joining the firm, Mr. Johnson bought a $1.4million house in Virginia.   In any case, Johnson-Smick clients apparently think theservice is worth the money. When John Gutfreund, chiefexecutive of Salomon Brothers, a Johnson-Smick client, agreedto attend the April meeting of the G-7 Council, even some ofhis own aides were surprised. &quot;Sometimes we try to get himdown to meet the president, and he doesn't have time,&quot; saysStephen Bell, a managing director in Salomon's Washingtonoffice.   Mr. Gutfreund sat through several hours of debate. He gothis reward when he was seated next to Mr. Poehl at lunch, achoice opportunity for an executive eager to expand hisbusiness in Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
