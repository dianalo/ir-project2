South African officials said Cuban officials assured them theywere not reinforcing their garrisons in Angola.   Foreign Minister Roelof Botha, speaking in South Africa, saidhis delegation quoted the Cubans as saying recent Cuban trooparrivals in Angola were replacements for troops about to be senthome. Botha said he asked for greater clarification on this issue.   Neil Van Heerden, South African director-general for foreignaffairs, told reporters in Brazzaville the talks will continueuntil Friday.   The U.S. State Department estimates 50,000 Cuban troops are inAngola, supporting the Marxist government against anti-Marxistguerrillas and South African military incursions.   Guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi and U.S. sources have claimedCuba was sending an additional 10,000 troops to Angola. SouthAfrica said this violate a month-old cease-fire between SouthAfrica and Angolan-Cuban forces.   A timetable for Cuban withdrawal has been the main obstacle toan agreement, which would also facilitiate independence for theSouth African-ruled territory of South-West Africa, or Namibia.South Africa has linked Namibian independence to Cuban troopwithdrawal from Namibia's northern neighbor, Angola.   A senior Angolan diplomat meanwhile was quoted as sayingThursday that Savimbi's UNITA _ the National Union for the TotalIndependence of Angola _ plans to move its headquarters from Jambain southeastern Angola to northern Quimbele, near Angola's borderwith Zaire.   A report from the Angolan news agency ANGOP, monitored inLisbon, Portugal, quoted Andre Neto, an Angolan diplomat in Lusaka,Zambia, as saying the move was to facilitate the continuation ofU.S. military aid to UNITA from what he claimed was a U.S. militarybase at Kamina in Zaire.   Zaire and the United States deny allegations that Zaire allowsAmerica to supply UNITA rebels with arms by way of a disused airbase in Zaire.   In a separate report Thursday, ANGOP said the first of 11planned frontier control posts, manned by Angolan and South Africanforces to monitor a cease-fire agreement, was officially openedTuesday.   Savimbi does not recognize the cease-fire, as UNITA is not partyto the U.S.-sponsored talks. UNITA statements, released in LisbonThursday, claimed the rebels killed 61 Angolan soldiers and shotdown an MI-17 helicopter, killing all those on board, in sixseparate clashes.   Rebel casualties were given as seven dead and 16 wounded.</TEXT></DOC>
