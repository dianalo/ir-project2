He uses the elasticfiber in everything from flowing formals to body-huggingsportswear. &quot;Europeans are mad about Lycra,&quot; says U.S.designer Norma Kamali.   That's great news for Du Pont Co., the fiber's inventor.</LP><TEXT>   Lycra symbolizes what Du Pont is striving to become inEurope in the 1990s: flexible, high-tech -- and veryprofitable. With Lycra leading the way, the Wilmington, Del.,chemical producer is applying its technological savvy --gained by spending $1.4 billion a year on research -- toEuropean markets where it can command top dollar for itsproducts.   The strategy means emphasizing products with a cleartechnological edge while scaling back on commodity-typechemicals, even when it means closing whole operations.   So far, the approach has helped the company succeed in amarket where some major rivals and other big U.S. companiesare floundering. Du Pont's European division, including theConoco petroleum operations, is expected to contribute morethan 40%, or about $1.1 billion, of Du Pont's estimated $2.55billion in operating profit this year. That's nearly twicethe European operation's contribution to operating profitjust four years ago. Du Pont's European sales during the sameperiod have surged more than 50%, even though a strongerdollar recently and weak European economies have slowedgrowth somewhat.   Europe holds a growing allure for multinational companies.When most European Community trade barriers fall by the endof next year, the largest single market in the industrializedworld will be up for grabs. Without a significant Europeanoperation, corporations risk being global also-rans by theturn of the century.   &quot;We've done well so far, but we have to have a muchstronger presence in Europe to be a great global company,&quot;says David Williamson, Du Pont Europe president.   The company operates a network of 45 European plants andhas begun an ambitious expansion program. In northern Spain,a $200 million factory to make flame-retardant Nomex fibersis under construction, part of a planned $1 billion expansionproject in that country. Near Dunkirk, France, anagricultural chemicals plant is being built.   Besides Lycra and Nomex, other products Du Pont is pushinginclude extra-strong Kevlar synthetic fibers used forbullet-proofing, Arylon polymers for auto interiors, andchemicals used to purify water and make paint pigments. Inaddition, fewer of Du Pont's low-margin commodity chemicalsthat have been a recent drag on U.S. earnings are being madein Europe. During the past decade, Dupont has closed ortrimmed production of such basic products as Orlon syntheticfiber and certain commodity chemicals in Europe.   The economies of scale that Du Pont wrings from itsfactory network helps it keep costs low and profit marginshigh. Its facilities and marketing strategies also serve allof Europe, not just France, Germany or Britain. Many otherU.S. corporate giants, including leading auto and computercompanies, are still revamping country-by-country productionand distribution channels in preparation for a unifiedEuropean market.   What Du Pont has done with Lycra offers a glimpse of itsEuropean strategy. The elastic fiber has grown from a modeststart 30 years ago as a rubber substitute in women's girdlesto become the company's largest product world-wide. While DuPont doesn't break out financial results by product, industryanalysts estimate that worldwide operating income from Lycrathis year will reach $250 million, or 10% of the company'stotal estimated operating income, on sales of $900 million.   Indeed, Du Pont's fibers division, where Lycra salesaccount for most of the profits, was the sole bright spot inthe company's third-quarter earnings. While Du Pont's netincome and sales were each down 5% for the quarter, after-taxoperating profit from fibers more than doubled to $150million from $72 million a year earlier.   To capitalize on Europe's fashion trendsetting position,all Lycra production and sales are managed from Du Pont'sEuropean headquarters here. Du Pont has successfully promotedthe fiber for a variety of applications beyond the lucrativeactivewear market that boomed during the fitness craze of the1980s.   Ms. Kamali, the New York designer, lately has beenincorporating the fiber into a host of materials, includingcotton T-shirts and what she calls &quot;stretch velvet.&quot; DesignerDonna Karan mixes Lycra with wool in men's jackets.   The fiber also is used extensively in women's hosiery. AndDu Pont scientists hit the jackpot a few years ago when theydeveloped a version of Lycra used instead of rubber along theedges of disposable diapers. One-in-four disposable diapersnow use Lycra.   Since the original Lycra patent lapsed long ago,look-alike spandex fibers are being marketed by severalEuropean and Asian competitors, such as Imperial ChemicalIndustries PLC of Britain. But they aren't making much of adent in sales of Lycra, which command a 60%-plus share of theworld market.   Another product giving Du Pont an edge in Europe is ahollow polyester fiber called Quallofil, used in mattressesand bedding material. A fire-retardant version gainedpopularity after a number of fatal hotel fires in Britain afew years ago forced Parliament to adopt legislationmandating fire-resistant mattresses.   Du Pont's European researchers also have developed afirmer version of polyester fiberballs, called Comforel, thatmimic the feel of goose down. French furniture maker PierreRoset is using the material to stuff cushions in his fallline of furniture.   Du Pont's European operations haven't been error-free. Twoyears ago the company paid more than $600 million for twoBritish photo printing companies and so far has little toshow for its investment. Analysts claim the company erred inpurchasing businesses not tied closely to its core operationsand in underestimating the time and money required to turnthe operations around. In the third quarter, the imagingcompanies cost Du Pont an additional $16 million inrestructuring charges.   Du Pont also has had trouble converting promising researchin drugs into commercial products in the U.S. and Europe. Tocompensate for a lack of marketing muscle in drugs, thecompany in January formed a joint venture with giant Merck andamp;Co. to produce and market drugs. The venture is expected tobe only modestly profitable this year.   Du Pont's success with Lycra, though, should help it buytime to remedy its strategic shortcomings. &quot;Lycra,&quot; assertsdesigner Calvin Klein, &quot;isn't in or out of fashion, it's away of life.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
