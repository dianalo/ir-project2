The acquisition would be the latest in a series of purchases by the Kuwait state agency of strategic stakes in industrial companies in Europe and North America. Completion of the offer would give the agency a say in the running of Montreal-based Consolidated-Bathurst through a voting trust agreement with Power Corp. of Canada, a holding concern, which would retain its 40% stake in Consolidated-Bathurst. The agreement would give the Kuwait agency the right to nominate two members of Consolidated's board, which currently has 18 directors.    The Kuwaiti agency said it will offer C$19 a share for 10.5 million Consolidated-Bathurst Class A and Class B shares in any combination.    Following the announcement, Consolidated-Bathurst Class A shares closed yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange at C$17, up C$1.25. The Class B shares didn't trade. Power Corp. stock closed at C$13.25, up 37.5 Canadian cents.    The agency said the purpose of the offer is to &quot;acquire a substantial long-term investment in Consolidated-Bathurst.&quot; A spokeswoman for the agency in London wouldn't elaborate.    A. Frank Knowles, Power Corp.'s president, welcomed the Kuwaiti investment. He said the connection was developed by Paul Desmarais, Power Corp.'s chairman and controlling shareholder. &quot;They looked into Power Corp. and decided that they would like to come with us in a venture in Canada,&quot; Mr. Knowles said.    &quot;It means that we could have a very good, financially sound partner for any other thing we may wish to do in the future,&quot; he added.    Mr. Knowles said Montreal-based Power Corp. continues to regard Consolidated-Bathurst as one of its &quot;core&quot; holdings and doesn't intend to reduce its stake in the company. Power Corp. also has holdings in financial services and newspaper publishing.    The Kuwait Investment Office's most publicized holding in the West is its roughly 22% stake in British Petroleum Co., acquired late last year. In May, the British government announced an inquiry into the stake, citing &quot;public interest&quot; concerns about Kuwait's possible influence on the oil company. Fearing such regulatory backlashes, the agency usually keeps a low profile in its investments and seldom seeks a board seat.    The agency also holds a 14% stake in West Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, a 14.55% stake in Royal Bank of Scotland, and interests in several Spanish industrial companies, including Torras-Hostench S.A., a paper manufacturer.    Brian Topp, an analyst with Capital Group Securities Inc., Toronto, noted that the Kuwaiti agency is paying a premium of about 20% over Consolidated-Bathurst's Friday stock close. &quot;It ain't cheap,&quot; he said of the offer price.    The voting trust agreement will last an initial five years and will be subject to annual extensions thereafter. The Kuwaiti agency won't be able to sell its shares for the first five years except if Power Corp. decides to sell its Consolidated-Bathurst shares. After five years, Power Corp. will have a right of first refusal on the Consolidated-Bathurst shares held by the Kuwaiti agency.    Associated Newspaper Holdings PLC, a British newspaper publishing concern, also has a 15% stake in Consolidated-Bathurst but it wasn't known whether it will tender any of its shares to the Kuwaiti agency.    ---   Craig Forman contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
