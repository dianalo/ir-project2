In the most thoroughly documented case, a raging fire aboard theUSS Belknap in the Mediterranean Sea in 1975 came within 40 feet ofnuclear weapons aboard the missile cruiser, according to a militarycable released by the Greenpeace environmental group.   Joshua Handler, director of the Greenpeace Nuclear Free Seacampaign, said at a news conference today that Pentagonauthorities' ``record on public disclosure of naval accidents is asbad as their accident record itself.''   Despite the disclosures, the Navy maintained its policy ofrefusing to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons on itsvessels.   The admiral who commanded the carrier task force to whichBelknap belonged confirmed the incident and told The AssociatedPress that he had witnessed two additional accidents thatthreatened nuclear weapons aboard ships.   ``I have seen firsthand a live nuclear weapon caught in a fuelfire. I have seen a nuclear weapon crushed in a hoist, an elevatorthat carries nuclear weapons to the flight deck,'' said retiredRear Adm. Eugene Carroll, who commanded the task force thatincluded the Belknap.   ``The military does not announce every time they have had adicey accident. They do so when the knowledge becomes public,''Carroll said.   In one case, he said, fire broke out on the hangar desk of anaircraft carrier, and ``the crew battled the fire, spraying wateron an airplane carrying a nuclear bomb, trying to keep it cooluntil they could get the thing off.''   In the three accidents, he said, ``we never faced the danger ofnuclear explosion. ... The warheads are configured in such a waythey a fire could not cause a nuclear detonation. But it couldspread a lot of radiation around.''   He declined to disclose further details of the elevator andaircraft fire incidents, but was willing to discuss the Belknapaccident because Greenpeace released a previously classifieddocument describing the event.   The collision in the Mediterranean between the Belknap and theaircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy was widely reported, but theNavy did not note the nuclear aspect of the accident at the time orin lists released in 1981 and 1986 of incidents involving nuclearweapons.   William Arkin, a naval analyst working with Greenpeace, said,``The Navy's purposeful exclusion of the Belknap accident is aviolation of the public's right to know.''   Eight sailors were killed and 46 were injured when the Belknapand the Kennedy collided 70 miles off Sicily on Nov. 26, 1975.   A cable written by Carroll hours after the accident alertedsuperiors to the ``high probability that nuclear weapons'' on themissile cruiser ``were involved in fire and explosions subsequentto the collision.''   Aviation fuel from the carrier rained down on the cruiser,knocking out its firefighting equipment.   ``It was pretty hairy out there. As we viewed the Belknap, itseemed to be a fairly total involvement. As it turned out, the firegutted the midships,'' Carroll said.   The destroyer USS Claude V. Ricketts came alongside, in heavyseas and driving rains, and helped extinguish the fire, thecommander of the Ricketts, Robert C. Powers, said in a 1976 articlepublished in the U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings.   Carroll's cable, stamped ``Secret,'' said that an unknown numberof W-45 warheads were aboard the cruiser and alerted the AtlanticCommand ``of high probability that nuclear weapons on USS Belknapwere involved in fire and explosions subsequent to the collision.''   The cable said officers aboard the Kennedy had ``no directcommunications with Belknap at this time. No positive indicationsthat explosions were directly related to nuclear weapons. No repeatno Kennedy weapons involved. Fires on Belknap diminishing at thistime.''   It also said ``casualties recovered thus far show no repeat noexposure to radiation'' but that ``monitoring teams and medicalpersonnel alerted possibility of contamination.''   A man who identified himself as a former sailor from the Belknapsaid today he had suffered severe burns fighting the fire and hadbeen checked for radation for the next three years by Navy doctors.No traces of radiation were found, said the sailor, who telephonedThe Associated Press after reading accounts of the disclosures.   Carroll, now deputy director of the liberal Center for DefenseInformation in Washington, said, ``The idea that this is a `brokenarrow' never released is incorrect. I sent subsequent messages thatthe nuclear weapons were not endangered.'' A ``broken arrow'' is anaccident involving nuclear weapons.   Arkin said other documents showed that there were six W-45warheads, used by Terrier anti-aircraft missiles aboard theBelknap. He said he based his 40-foot estimate on photographs ofthe damaged ship; Carroll said that estimate was correct.   The ship, severely damaged, was decommissioned, returned to thePhiladelphia Navy Yard, and recommissioned after four years ofrepair work.   The Navy, responding to Arkin's report, said no nuclear weaponswere involved in the fire, and adhered to its policy of refusing tocomment on reports of nuclear weapons aboard vessels.   ``It is U.S. government policy neither to confirm nor deny thepresence of nuclear weapons on ships, aircraft or U.S. militaryinstallations,'' said Lt. Bruce Cole, a Navy spokesman. ``Thatpolicy applied in 1975 as it does now.''   Cole confirmed that the Belknap was capable of carrying Terrieranti-aircraft missiles, a weapon that can be armed with nuclear orconventional warheads, but said, ``The 1981 Department of Defensereport is correct in that no nuclear weapons were affected by the1975 Belknap-Kennedy collision.''   On May 8, Arkin and Greenpeace disclosed that a hydrogen bombaccidentally lost off the carrier USS Ticonderoga in 1965 was 80miles off Okinawa, now part of Japan, rather than ``more than 500miles from land ... at sea in the Pacific,'' as disclosed in thePentagon's 1986 list of accidents involving nuclear weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
