Leon Panetta, D-Calif.,chairman of the House Budget Committee who will not be on hand forthe session.   Government spending and taxing has been the product ofhigh-level negotiations between White House officials and theleaders of Congress for the last three years.   But the budget deifict has drifted upward all the same and manyin Congress have soured on such sessions.   Sunday's meeting is already being portrayed as no more than apreliminary discussion of whether there is a will to hold moredetailed budget talks later.   ``It's a chance to discuss what the process will be, where we gofrom here. The president's budget has been up there for sometime,'' on Capitol Hill, White House spokesman Steve Hart saidSaturday. ``We've expressed a willingness to have negotiations.''   Hart said the meeting in the White House residence quarterswould be private between the president and the congressionalleaders, with possibly a few aides also on hand.   Talking with Bush will be House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,D-Wash.; House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.; SenateMajority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine; and Senate MinorityLeader Bob Dole, R-Kan.   The lowering of expectations is being done with good reason.Using top-level negotiations to shape the government's $1.2trillion budget has proven a tricky path to follow.   Results of the last two negotiated budgets have been spotty atbest.   A November 1987 deal between Congress and President Reagancalled for $30 billion in deficit reduction in fiscal 1988 and $46billion more in fiscal 1989. Reagan hailed the pact as ``a good,solid beginning'' to controlling the deficit.   The results were less dramatic. In the end, the 1988 deficit was$155 billion, $5 billion higher than the previous year. The 1989shortfall dropped a bit to $152 billion.   In April 1989, high-level talks involving the new Bushadministration yielded a deal for fiscal 1990, which runs untilOct. 1. The agreement was supposed to shrink the budget gap to $99billion. But the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office expectsthis year's shortfall to reach $159 billion.   ``When my Wall Street clients read about a $50 billion deficitreduction package, they divide it by 10,'' said Stanley Collender,who monitors the budget for Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm.   What has gone wrong? Some of the savings the negotiators agreedto were premised on the economy running on a higher gear than itactually did. The poorer economic performance meant lower taxcollections for the government.   Other savings never materialized because negotiators agreed tospending cuts and higher revenues that Congress simply rejected.   That points to a hurdle faced by high-level budget negotiatorswho agree to a deficit-reduction package. Their next job is to getkey committee chairpersons _ and a majority of members of the Houseand Senate _ to go along. And that is not easy when so many ofCongress' natural power centers are left out of bargaining sessions.   ``To bind anybody, you've got to have a broader group'' thanthose attending Sunday's meeting, said Rep. Silvio Conte ofMassachusetts, ranking Republican on the House AppropriationsCommittee.   Some legislators believe their political parties need to definetheir budget priorities clearly and that negotiated deals blur thedistinction between Democrats and Republicans. Others flatly opposeall negotiated budget deals, complaining that it leaves outlawmakers and entire committees that should be involved.   Translation: a budget pact worked out by the president and theleaders of Congress still needs a majority of votes in the Houseand Senate. And some members' votes do not come easily.   Asked last week about the potential product of possible budgettalks, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten,D-Miss., said, ``I'm all for it, provided it's something I agreewith.''</TEXT></DOC>
