But in the legal trenches of America, it is often referred to as the Immigration Lawyers' Retirement Act.    To the delight of some and the disgust of others, the most sweeping immigration act of the century is creating a wealth of clients and litigation. The new legislation is at once a labor law, a civil-rights act and a de facto declaration of U.S. foreign policy. With confusion widespread, employers and immigrants have become targets for profiteering, civil-rights crusading and fraud.    &quot;It's just too tempting not to jump into it because of the money to be made,&quot; says Arturo Juaregui of Chicago, a lawyer with the nonprofit Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund. &quot;It's a huge market.&quot; Adds Leonel Castillo, a former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service: &quot;We have developed a whole new industry with this law . . . the immigration industry.&quot;    Lawyers and consultants are seldom far behind when a new law affects so many potential clients. This one affects both the nation's seven million employers and an estimated two million to four million illegal immigrants. It gives the immigrants one year to legalize their status through a one-time-only &quot;amnesty&quot; and creates a system of fines and even jailings for employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants.    Simple enough? Hardly. There are dozens of high-stakes issues still to be worked out. The law will split up many immigrant families, but the Immigration Service now has the discretion to keep some families united even though all their members don't meet the five-year residency requirement. Florida sugar-cane cutters wonder why they were shut out of an accelerated legalization program for farm workers while sugar-beet hoers weren't. And employers are now learning it can be unlawful to fire illegal immigrants who are seeking legalization.    Amid the uncertainty, entrepreneurial spirit abounds. Employers are paying $1,000 apiece for legal seminars, subscribing to $500 newsletters, and buying both guidebooks and videocassettes prepared by lawyers. Grotta, Glassman andamp; Hoffman, a large law firm in Roseland, N.J., that specializes in labor law, is immersing young associates in immigration law so that the firm can continue providing a full range of services. And the staid and long-established Bureau of National Affairs is promoting its new, $377-a-year immigration newsletter for employers with this warning: &quot;No one knows yet how many employers will go to jail.&quot;    &quot;Everyone and his grandmother is now saying, 'Come to us. We will show you the way,'&quot; says Adan Vega, a Houston immigration lawyer who has written a $29.95 guidebook for employers on the law.    Many argue that they are performing a necessary service because the immigration agency is so late educating those affected by the law. Many employers, for example, only began receiving the official Immigration Service handbook this month, eight months after the law was signed. And the winners of a $10.7 million contract, awarded three months ago, today launched an advertising campaign aimed at employers in nearly 100 U.S. newspapers.    Illegal immigrants can't spend as freely as the companies that employ them, but they, too, are targets of the immigration industry. A Spanish-speaking TV priest in Phoenix narrates a $34.95 video on the law. Lawyers specializing in &quot;la ley de amnistia&quot; advertise their services in Miami's La Estrella de Nicaragua, New York's Irish Echo, San Francisco's Philippine News and church bulletins in Houston. Marcos Antonio Amaya of Bolivar, El Salvador, paid an entrepreneur $50 for saving a place in the all-night line at an amnesty-processing center in Houston, but others in the line refused to let him cut in.    Long subject to price-gouging &quot;immigration consultants&quot; and unscrupulous lawyers, illegal immigrants have also become the victims in more elaborate and brazen scams. In Dallas, immigrants were paying a self-styled consulting firm as much as $100 for a tax-identification number that the Internal Revenue Service distributes free. In Los Angeles, Francisco Alvarez paid a counseling service $400 for a worthless laminated identification card that &quot;certified&quot; him as an applicant for legalization. In New York City, some travel agents peddle useless immigration advice to unsuspecting Caribbean immigrants.    But perhaps the most brazen inducements are those of Jorge Vasquez Campbell, who broadcasts nightly over &quot;Radio Canon&quot; from Juarez, Mexico, on a program that reaches as far as the San Joaquin Valley of Central California. One of his solicitations begins with heavy pounding on a door. &quot;Immigration. Open the door,&quot; a man yells. &quot;Mijo,&quot; says a father to his panicky son. &quot;Calm down. Let me think.&quot; But another voice says there is no need for further thinking: &quot;If you are worried about your immigration problem, call me.&quot;    By enticing fellow Mexicans to cross the Rio Grande for his advice, Mr. Vasquez Campbell, who once boasted that the immigration law would make him a millionaire in a year, has caused some immigrants to break their continuous residency in the U.S., a legalization requirement, his U.S. detractors note.    Benita Martinez, a client from Las Cruces, N.M., says she paid Mr. Vasquez Campbell $400 and gave him valuable original documents to support her legalization claim. Seven months later, despite her payment, she was standing in line at an Immigration Service processing center in El Paso with her husband, Dionisio, a roofer who is a legal resident, and their six U.S.-born children, who are citizens. The money and the original documents are gone, Mr. Martinez says. &quot;I'm scared that they may take my mommy back to Mexico,&quot; frets 12-year-old Juanita Martinez.    Mr. Vasquez Campbell claims that criticism about his legal advice comes from Mexican-Americans, a group he holds in some disdain. &quot;We have a blood war between the Mexican-American and the Mexican,&quot; he says. &quot;They can't handle that they are not completely Mexican or completely American.&quot; And he insists that he only processes legalization applications for farm workers in his Juarez office. Under a separate legalization program, farm workers' applications can be processed outside the U.S. because of the migrant nature of the work. However, Mrs. Martinez sought legalization under the general amnesty provisions of the new law.    U.S. immigration lawyers, once primarily an East Coast inner-city fixture, grew more numerous after the previous overhaul of immigration law, in 1965. But the growth then was small compared with what happened after the U.S. started debating immigration laws in earnest six years ago. Since then, membership in the American Immigration Lawyers Association has jumped to 2,500 from 1,400. After the law was signed, membership started growing by 50 to 75 lawyers a month.    Once derided as a poor stepchild of the bar, immigration law easily rivals tax law in its complexity and is winning more respect in some quarters. Charles Foster, a former president of the immigration lawyers' group, recalls proposing state certification for immigration attorneys to scoffs and guffaws in 1975. Today, three states -- California, Texas and Florida -- formally recognize immigration law as a specialty. Some 100 courses on immigration are offered at law schools, including those at Harvard, Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley. &quot;More and more people will be aware of this little speciality,&quot; Mr. Foster says.    For many of the lawyers, whether they represent corporations or immigrants, philosophical opposition to the new law makes their practice passionate as well as profitable. At a recent seminar in Houston, Nancy M. O'Connor, a labor lawyer with the prestigious corporate firm of Fulbright andamp; Jaworski, told 300 applauding colleagues, &quot;It should never be illegal for an honest employer to offer honest work to an honest employee.&quot;    And although many immigration attorneys specialize in handling personnel transfers for multinational companies, growth has brought in a number of young, liberal activists. William Tamayo of Oakland, Calif., a 33-year-old lawyer of Philippine descent, draws professional inspiration from the harsh treatment that Asian immigrants have received. &quot;When you advocate for immigrants, especially undocumented immigrants, you advocate for a sector of society that is not white, that can't vote, that has no money,&quot; Mr. Tamayo says. &quot;And on top of it, they are blamed for job losses, drugs, terrorism and even traffic congestion.&quot;    The law has also given new purpose to some nonprofit legal-service centers specializing in immigrant rights. On New York City's lower East Side, attorney Felix Cardona toils in a cluttered fourth-floor office above an old brownstone church once known as First German Methodist Episcopal Church but now called &quot;Iglesia de Todas Las Naciones,&quot; or Church of All Nations. Mr. Cardona spends a lot of time explaining to confused employers that illegal immigrants hired before President Reagan signed the law on Nov. 6, 1986, can continue to be lawfully employed.    At the Center for Immigrant Rights, Mr. Cardona also helps illegal immigrants document their continuous residency when they have used aliases or false Social Security cards and worked for multiple employers.    &quot;I worked in so many places -- Massachusetts, Rhode Island,&quot; says one of Mr. Cardona's clients, who came to the U.S. from Colombia in 1975. &quot;Some places even aren't there anymore.&quot;    Near the northern tip of Manhattan, where Harlem melts into Washington Heights, Dominicans live in crowded, rundown tenements near tiny grocery stores that burst with mangoes, &quot;empanadas,&quot; merengue music and other island flavors and sounds. Notary publics here can charge high fees for bad advice to unsuspecting Latin immigrants who believe a &quot;notario&quot; in the U.S. is the equivalent of a &quot;notario&quot; in Latin America, who is actually a lawyer.    Such exploitation inspired Julio Hernandez to start the North Manhattan Immigrant Rights Coalition. One recent evening, nearly 100 Dominican illegals gathered at the Tamoril Community Center for pool, bingo and one of Mr. Hernandez's lectures. He raised the hopes of 25-year-old Yabira Ebie. &quot;I can go to school,&quot; she said. &quot;I can get a better job. I can be free.&quot; But Mr. Hernandez isn't a lawyer, and some lawyers view what he does as unauthorized practice of the law. Mr. Hernandez's response: &quot;I can't stand lawyers.&quot;    Before long, immigration lawyers will be spending more time in the courtroom than in community centers and legal clinics. Litigation -- over the definition of employment discrimination, the technicalities of legalization and the confidentiality of the entire process -- is bound to flood the courts, the lawyers say.    For employers, one of the most volatile issues is the Immigration Service's power under the new law to raid businesses in search of illegal immigrants. The case being studied by both sides of the issue involves Ulysses &quot;Blackie&quot; Auger, whose Washington, D.C., beef restaurant was the site of a federal raid in 1978 in which 14 illegal workers were seized during the busy lunch hour.    Mr. Auger mounted a Fourth Amendment fight against unreasonable searches. The U.S. Supreme Court eventually ruled against him, but under the new law things might have been different; with criminal penalties at stake, lawyers can more cogently argue that the Immigration Service needs much more detailed search warrants than the vague one used to invade Mr. Auger's establishment.    &quot;There needs to be a test case,&quot; says the 65-year-old restaurateur. But after years of court fights, he says, someone else will have to wage the war. &quot;I paid my dues,&quot; he says. &quot;Let some big company fight it next time.&quot;    ---   Costs of Legalization             Basic application and processing Individual                                 $250-455 Family of Four                             $630-1,360 Attorney Fees For simple, individual case                $500-2,000</TEXT></DOC>
