That's when the now-famous Patriotsystem slammed into a Scud missile, the first of manyinterceptions now occurring daily.   Yes, the Patriot isn't full-blown &quot;Star Wars.&quot; But theprinciple of intercepting missiles before they hit civiliansis what most SDI supporters, including us, have beenpromoting all along. And it was only in the 1980s, underRonald Reagan, that the Patriot was adapted from ananti-aircraft system into one that could shoot down missiles.After Patriot's success, the next step is to ensure for allAmericans the same protection on the U.S. mainland.</LP><TEXT>   Fortunately, members of the Bush administration aredeveloping such a defense. It's known as &quot;GPALS&quot; for globalprotection against limited strikes. The GPALS design, SDIDirector Henry Cooper told a science group in December, meansthat &quot;SDI is a technically viable program that could lead toreal capabilities in the foreseeable future.&quot; President Bushhas a winner here if he gets behind it.   The Soviets already have ICBMs, but the CIA says 15 othernations will have ballistic missiles by the year 2000, andthat's a conservative estimate. While Scuds still havelimited range, ballistic-missile technology is moving so fastit's only a matter of time before many countries havemissiles able to reach Manhattan or Miami. Those missileswill be able to carry chemical, nuclear and even biologicalwarheads. The question is whether the U.S. will be able to doanything but watch them land.   The GPALS concept would deploy interceptors on the groundand in space. Ground interceptors would be advanced versionsof the Patriot and have a &quot;footprint,&quot; or area of coverage,as much as 100 times greater. These would be buttressed by1,000 space-based interceptors known as &quot;brilliant pebbles.&quot;The combined system could be deployed in the U.S. and inregional theaters like the Mideast, protecting against 100 orso incoming missiles at a time.   After Patriot, even anti-SDI zealots like Florida Rep.Charles Bennett are likely to favor ground interceptors. Butthe space-based interceptors are just as important. They'recheaper -- about half as expensive to deploy in GPALS,according to Mr. Cooper. They also provide global, ratherthan merely regional, protection, because they'll fly inorbit around the earth. Critics, such as John Pike of theAmerican Federation of Scientists, will say they won't work,but they said that about Patriot.   Brilliant Pebbles looks promising now for the same reasonother weapons are working against Iraq -- the microchip.&quot;Innovation is now possible because of the maturingtechnologies that allow smaller, lighter, cheaper, morepowerful key technical components,&quot; Mr. Cooper said.   GPALS would also protect against a limited or accidentalSoviet launch -- no small fear given Soviet turmoil. And itwould include so-called Brilliant Eyes, a system of manysmall satellites that would detect and judge hostile launchesand perhaps gather other intelligence too. Partial deploymentcould begin as early as 1996.   The Patriot's success shows how much an anti-missiledefense can serve U.S. diplomatic goals. If the &quot;new worldorder&quot; depends on building coalitions, the U.S. job will beeasier if it can offer protection against enemy missiles.Arms-controllers will fret that GPALS violates the 1969 ABMTreaty, a view sometimes known as cutting off your nose tospite your face. While the U.S. complies with an arms-controlpromise, a Saddam may act.   Congress slashed SDI spending by $1.6 billion to $2.9billion last year. More cuts this year will ensure thatAmericans remain as vulnerable as Israelis on those first,terrifying nights in Tel Aviv. President Bush has a chance tosay he thinks Americans deserve a better defense againstmissiles than gas masks and a prayer.</TEXT></DOC>
