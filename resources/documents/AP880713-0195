The Labor Party leader mentioned no names, but since his arrivalin southern Africa last Friday he has attacked Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher and President Reagan for opposing sanctions.   Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher argue that South African blacks andneighboring black-ruled states would suffer most from such measures.   Kinnock is on a four-nation tour and met on Wednesday withPresident Quett Masire at the end of a three-day visit to Botswana,which borders South Africa.   ``I am greatly impressed by the progress in this peaceful,prosperous democracy,'' he said of Botswana, which has held regularelections and built one of Africa's fastest-growing economies in 21years of independence.   He praised Botswana for ``demonstrating immense bravery'' bytaking a strong stand against South Africa and its apartheidpolicies but acknowledged it would be ``economic suicide'' for thelandlocked country to impose sanctions on its southern neighbor.   He added, however: ``If faraway nations that are much strongerand much less tied to South Africa showed the same bravery,including the imposition of sanctions ... then apartheid would bemuch nearer its death.''   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.   Kinnock also condemned South Africa's recent military raids intoBotswana and repeated a call for more Western military aid toneighboring states.   South Africa says its purpose in raiding Botswana is to strikebases of the African National Congress, the main guerrilla movementseeking to end white domination of South Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
