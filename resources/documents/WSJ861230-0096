The man who claims to be the exiled king of Serbia and Bosnia, Kralj Marziano II Lavarello-Obrenovich, lives alone in a simple apartment in Rome. His kingdom doesn't exist anymore (it is part of Yugoslavia). He has no queen and is without heirs.    He has lost nearly all his riches. What wasn't confiscated by the Yugoslavs and taxed by the Italians was stolen by an accountant several years ago. The king doesn't even own a crown (he did once, but another thief took it). The Yugoslav government obviously doesn't intend to restore Serbia and Bosnia to the throne, so the king's chances of regaining his domain are bleak.    But the 63-year-old monarch does have one possession of value: the royal titles that aides claim he can legally bestow. For a fee, of course.    The king, tall and straight with pale blue eyes that water easily when he speaks of the past, says his family has experienced &quot;a lot of ups and downs in the past 2,000 years.&quot; But the selection of Serbian noblemen could &quot;keep the past alive.&quot;    Selling royal titles may be legal, but it isn't regal, the king's detractors say. &quot;There ought to be a commission set up to see that these people are discouraged -- or jailed,&quot; snaps H.B. Brooks-Baker, the publishing director at Burke's Peerage in London, which researches royal bloodlines. The sale of titles &quot;makes a laughingstock out of something that has legitimate value. It undermines a useful institution.&quot;    Besides, he adds, &quot;Nobody who buys a title mixes with anybody with a real title.&quot;    Nevertheless, the sale of royal titles is a booming business. Strutt andamp; Parker, an auction house, hawked lordships in London recently for about $10,000 each.    But the king's aides say his isn't your run-of-the-mill auction. Although the king himself has never visited Yugoslavia, proceeds from the sale will be used to establish a foundation to promote Serbian art and literature. And not everyone who wants a title will get one, even if they are willing to pay the $10,000 to $20,000 &quot;suggested donation.&quot;    About 35 people, mostly Americans, have applied to become Serbian nobility. Yet about half of the candidates are simply &quot;unacceptable,&quot; say the king's aides. None of the nine vacant titles has been awarded yet -- and none will be unless the proper candidates are found.    &quot;The titles will be conferred to persons who will carry on the name and glory of the royal house,&quot; says Prince Frank of Kratowvo, who is general secretary of the Royal and Imperial House of Serbia and Bosnia. &quot;And to keep the flame burning,&quot; the king interjects. &quot;Of course it would be ridiculous not to accept a donation,&quot; the prince adds, while his wife, Princess Sara of Kratowvo, who is missing several teeth, nods and repeats &quot;ridiculous.&quot;    Various mafiosi have offered to buy their titles. &quot;One handed me a blank check and said put down whatever figure you want,&quot; the prince exclaims. But he would never bestow a title to someone who wasn't the &quot;right&quot; kind of person.    The imperial household is in disarray, judging from the king's modest and unheated Rome living quarters. The royal office consists of two rooms and a wide hallway, all cluttered with flags, tapestries, paintings and other regal paraphernalia, including a crushed silver crown.    &quot;There is no way of calculating the value of what I have lost,&quot; says the king, who still wears a big ring with the family insignia. While he hasn't &quot;stooped to selling off the property of the royal house,&quot; his majesty notes that entertaining is getting more expensive all the time.    The king's aides bristle at the suggestion that the king is influenced by pecuniary considerations. &quot;We don't simply sell the vacant titles,&quot; says Ralf Huber, the king's cultural counselor, who is conducting the search for royal candidates from his own castle in southern Germany. Mr. Huber is himself a Serbian count, a title given to him by you know who. &quot;The money is really secondary,&quot; he says. &quot;We want people who will represent the honor of the Illyrian nobility.&quot;    The principality of Serbia dates to the 12th century. But because of frequent invasions by the Turks, a Serbian state wasn't recognized until 1878. It was in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo that a Serbian nationalist assassinated the Austrian Archduke Francis Ferdinand and his wife, prompting World War I.    King Marziano's lineage is confusing. In 1903, the reigning monarch of the Obrenovich dynasty, King Alexander V, was assassinated in Belgrade. Alexander's descendents then took up residence in Italy while another family assumed the throne. That family abdicated in 1944.    But the Obrenovich dynasty never relinquished its claims (twice it has failed in legal actions to recover lost property through the International Court in The Hague). King Marziano, a relative from a second branch of the Obrenovich dynasty, claims to be the 209th descendant of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great. He says he was crowned king in 1956 during a Serbian religious ceremony in Rome.    The king, who is said to lead an almost monastic life, has been deeply depressed over the years by his family's inability to retrieve its royal standing. &quot;He isn't a happy man,&quot; Count Huber says.    Perhaps most frustrating is that the king can't go home. He would like to make his first visit to Yugoslavia, he says, but considers it unwise.    Yet while the government might not welcome him, he is convinced the people would, with open arms. &quot;I would be very much welcome in Serbia,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
