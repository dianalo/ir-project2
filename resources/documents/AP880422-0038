Answering questions from an audience in Springfield, Mass.,Reagan also sought Thursday to lower expectations that thesuperpowers will agree soon on an accord to slash their arsenals ofintercontinental ballistic missiles.   During a speech which White House officials said would outlinesome U.S. objectives at the May 29-June 2 summit in Moscow, Reagansaid relations between Washington and Moscow have reached ``aperiod of realistic engagement.''   The president said the United States has achieved some successesin recent dealings with the Kremlin because American policy towardthe Soviet Union has placed more emphasis on preaching the gospelof freedom around the world _ rather than merely seeking to containcommunist expansionism.   Reagan's speech to the World Affairs Council of WesternMassachusetts was the second of its kind in recent weeks as he andhis aides prepare for the coming summit.   Asked by a law student to describe what would happen if theIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty is not ratified by theSenate by the time the summit arrives, Reagan said, ``I think itwould be very upsetting and it would put a strain on the summit.''   ``We hope and pray that they will (approve the pact), but thescheduling of it has been such that I am very concerned we may haveto go without having it ratified,'' he said.   Reagan got little comfort on that score Thursday, as SenateMajority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., declared, ``I am not goingto rush to judgment.''   Byrd said the Senate will not speed through the ratificationdebate, scheduled to start May 9.   ``We want a good treaty, that is our objective,'' the senatorsaid, adding that the White House-requested summit deadline forratification ``doesn't guide me at all.''   Several senators have expressed concern that provisions of theINF treaty may ban development of futuristic weapons.   En route to Massachusetts, presidential spokesman MarlinFitzwater said ``we'll be working with the Hill'' on this problem.But he also said ``it would be a shame if it did not happen. Wethink we can overcome any obstacles. But there are still hurdles tobe crossed.''   In response to another question during the Springfield outing,Reagan acknowledged that ``there's a great question'' about whethera treaty banning up to 50 percent of long-range nuclear missilescan be ready for signing during the Moscow summit.   But he said that ``we don't want a fast treaty. We want a goodtreaty. We have never set a deadline'' for agreement on thestrategic arms reduction pact (START).''   In his speech, Reagan apparently sought to lower expectationsabout an agreement on a START pact. He said that as part of theU.S.-Soviet agenda, arms control is ``not sturdy enough to bear upthe whole platform of Soviet-American relations.''   Because of this, the president said, he will focus on a varietyof issues in Moscow, including regional disputes in Afghanistan,Nicaragua and elsewhere, as well as human rights and bilateralrelations.   Reagan said that while much headway has been made in relationsbetween the superpowers, he remains wary of Moscow's intentions.   The president said, for instance, he's not sure of thegenuineness of the Soviet agreement to withdraw from Afghanistan.   ``Let me say here that the next few months will be no time forcomplacency, no time to sit back and congratulate ourselves,'' hesaid. ``The Soviets have rarely before, and not at all in more thanthree decades, left a country once occupied. They have oftenpromised to leave, but rarely in their history, and then only underpressure from the West, have they actually done it.''</TEXT></DOC>
