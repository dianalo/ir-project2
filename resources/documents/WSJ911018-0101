One caller denounces a bocasupposedly doing business behind the soccer stadium. Twocallers say a local bar is a front for a cocaine dealer.Another fingers a butcher shop.   Some of the addresses are new to the 31-year-old Mr.Anache; he puts those aside for checking. Others arenotorious -- he knows them well -- and he broadcasts themright away, adding his trademark exhortation: &quot;Come on,police. Let's go in there and smash these bastards, theserascals.&quot;   So it goes two hours a day, six days a week, on Mr.Anache's afternoon show on Radio Clube, Corumba's mostpopular station. He doesn't talk exclusively about drugs, butit sometimes seems that way.   Ever since he started his campaign 18 months ago, anddespite the death threats he says he has received, Mr. Anachehas roused citizens of Corumba to overcome their fear andfight drugs. At the same time, the picture that has emergedfrom all the calls and letters itself frightens the populaceof this small city in southwestern Brazil on the Bolivianborder. Says Rildo de Souza Duarte, deputy director of theCorumba jail: &quot;We woke up to realize the city is full of`bocas.'&quot;   Much of South America is waking up to the same reality. AsColombia's drug barons surrender or come under heavypressure, and as Peru and Bolivia battle coca-leafcultivation with U.S. military aid, the drug business isdiversifying and expanding. Police agencies say that Brazil,Argentina, Venezuela and even tiny Suriname are becomingmajor cocaine trans-shippers to the U.S. and Europe. The DrugEnforcement Administration says cocaine production is alsorising in some of those countries, as well as in Ecuador andParaguay. And throughout the region, cocaine consumption nowapparently is on the rise, too, in the face of the commonbelief that South America produces and sells drugs butdoesn't much use them.   &quot;The map of drug trafficking is changing,&quot; says Iban deRementeria, a drug expert with the Andean Commission ofJurists in Lima, Peru. &quot;New countries are appearing as areasof trans-shipment, transformation {of coca into cocaine} andconsumption. As production rises and internationalconsumption stabilizes, there will be more and more supply todomestic markets in countries like Colombia, Chile, Braziland Argentina. And, as in Colombia, there's a risk ofignoring the problem until it becomes uncontrollable.&quot;   Nowhere is the growing presence of drugs more evident thanin Brazil, recently described by Melvin Levitsky, U.S.assistant secretary of state for international narcoticsmatters, as &quot;the traffickers' target country.&quot; Brazil isstarting to live up to its potential in the drugtrade-potential evident in its 9,000 miles of borders withColombia, Peru and Bolivia; its huge, unpatrollable rainforests and rivers; airports and ports in major citiesproviding export outlets; ill-equipped police; and anineffective judiciary and widespread corruption.   &quot;Brazil is now the main route used by traffickers toexport cocaine to the U.S. and Europe,&quot; Roberto Precioso,head of the Sao Paulo narcotics division of the FederalPolice, said earlier this year. The 3.1 metric tons ofcocaine seized in the first eight months of this year alreadyexceed the 2.6 million tons seized in all of 1990which wastwice the 1989 take. In just one haul, in July, the federalpolice in Sao Paulo stopped a truck carrying more than half aton of cocaine.   None of this makes Brazil the new Colombia. But, saysRoberto Alves, chief of the federal police for the state ofMato Grosso do Sul, in which Corumba is located, &quot;theconditions for this are here. The demand for drugs is goingup constantly {and} we're starting to find primitivelaboratories.&quot; In some parts of the country, he adds, &quot;thewhole society is being structured around criminal activity.&quot;   Corumba, a sleepy city of 130,000 on the river Paraguay,is one such place. Long ago it was an active port and tradingcenter, but as river commerce declined, so did its economy.&quot;Now,&quot; says Vicente Sarubbi, a member of the state'santi-drug council, &quot;only drugs enter.&quot;   The local problem is hard to measure given the lack ofreliable statistics. But the local jail, built for 86 people,holds 235 inmates -- 167 of whom are there on drug charges.Police say crime figures are those of a city three timesCorumba's size, and 70% of crimes have to do with drugs. Thenumber of local retail drug outlets has risen to more than100, federal police say, and in August, policemen found sixcocaine refining labs just outside the city.   An association to treat addicts, created last year, nowsees 40 to 50 people a week. &quot;Their story is always thesame,&quot; says Laura Pinheiro, who started the association.   Typical is Ronei Midon, and his tale charts the advance ofdrugs in Corumba. &quot;When I started, I used {cocaine}socially,&quot; the 26-year-old says. &quot;The supply here waslimited.&quot; Then, about four years ago, pitilio, which is madefrom the residue of coca paste, appeared. &quot;You use it once,you want to use it again,&quot; says Mr. Midon. &quot;You smoke 10grams, then you want 15.&quot;   Soon, Mr. Midon says, he was completely hooked. &quot;I startedrobbing, first at home and then in people's cars and homes,to trade in the goods for pitilio at the boca. They trade foranything: clothes, food, pharmaceutical products, perfumes.&quot;   Because of its low price -- about $2 for two grams (enoughfor four or five cigarettes, in which the cocaine paste ismixed with tobacco) -- pitilio soon became &quot;the favoritedrug,&quot; says Mr. Midon.   As consumption grew, so did the number of bocas, whichusually are nothing more than a house in which a room hasbeen set aside for dealing and, sometimes, for smoking. Whenhe started using pitilio, Mr. Midon says, only a handful ofbocas existed here; now he can reel off a long list frommemory. &quot;As much as the police try,&quot; Mr. Midon says, &quot;it'sincreasing every day.&quot; He recently decided to go intorehabilitation.   Meanwhile, crimes and violence associated with drug useclearly are getting out of hand in Corumba's slums. &quot;A fewyears ago, you could leave your door open and go talk to yourneighbor,&quot; says Benedita, who lives in the Cristo Redentorslum. &quot;Now you can't leave your home or it gets robbed. Yourown children rob you to buy drugs.&quot; Benedita, who won't giveher last name, speaks from experience: One of her eightchildren, 11-year-old Daniel, smokes pitilio. He steals foodfrom home to trade in for drugs, and hangs around theCervejaria neighborhood where many of the bocas are.   One day, she says, &quot;I went to get him, and the dealerswouldn't let him go. They told me that if I denounced theirboca, they'd kill my son. I'm afraid. In this neighborhood,there are problems like this in every family.&quot;   While drug dealers increase their hold on the slums, thedrug business has permeated the local economy. Police saymore trading companies operate here than should be the case.Trade in toilet paper is oddly high. It is used as a filterin refining cocaine. &quot;There must have been a diarrheaepidemic in Bolivia,&quot; says the federal police's Mr. Alves.   Similarly, Corumba has close to 40 drugstores, about threetimes the number a city this size is supposed to need. Thereason, according to police: Many pharmacies buy and resellether and acetone, chemicals used in processing cocaine.Pharmacist Marina do Amaral was recently charged with selling264 liters of acetone in just five days last fall. Sheclaimed she sold the acetone -- which is of legitimate use tomanicurists -- liter by liter, as allowed by law, not inbulk. The trial judge did some calculating and figured shemust be selling a liter of acetone every five minutes, rathertoo much for it all to be used by people doing their nails.   &quot;There is no way to deny that this is absurd,&quot; Judge LuizClaudio Bonassini da Silva said in sentencing Ms. Amaral tothree years in prison. The &quot;excessive number of drugstores&quot;in Corumba &quot;sustains the innumerable clandestine laboratoriesinfesting the region to refine cocaine.&quot;   Still, Corumba was a reasonably peaceful place until Mr.Anache made the scene. Moved by a listener's complaint aboutthe impunity enjoyed by drug traffickers, the radiobroadcaster decided to start denouncing known bocas. &quot;Theproblem was there, staring us in the face, and no one wasdoing anything,&quot; he says. So on April 10, 1990, he took tothe airwaves and gave out the names and addresses of 15bocas. &quot;In the slums of Rio, traffickers have imposed a reignof fear,&quot; he says. &quot;I say they are the ones who should beafraid.&quot;   The appeal struck a nerve. Within days, Mr. Anache hadreceived numerous calls and letters with tips about bocasthat should be exposed. Also, he says, there were enoughthreats against him that he now always carries a gun and, onthe streets, has a bodyguard. &quot;It's for medical reasons,&quot; hejokes. &quot;My doctor tells me bullets could be bad for myhealth.&quot;   The letters continued, and Mr. Anache decided to keep upthe fight. &quot;Alone, people felt they couldn't do anything,&quot; hesays. &quot;Through me, they found a channel to vent their anger.People trust me because they know I never say where thedenunciations come from. They know I'll send on the tip tothe police and I'll ask for results.&quot;   Sometimes, there are results. &quot;I was listening toArmando's program, and I heard him say everyone knows wheredrugs are sold here and I thought: `He's right]'&quot; saysAlberto dos Santos Rosa, who heads the local military police.Last month, armed with search warrants and a list of 50 bocasculled from letters to Mr. Anache, the police dismantledeight bocas, jailed six people and confiscated some cocaineand stolen goods.   But police acknowledge the results are modest and sayBrazil is losing the drug war for lack of means. The federalpolice agency here has one detective and 19 men to patrol 200miles of border with Bolivia. &quot;The hard truth is that thefederal police doesn't have the structure to work inCorumba,&quot; says its head, Luis Goncalves. &quot;I can't at the sametime dismantle refineries, be at the police station, patrolthe borders and bring down the more than 100 bocas inCorumba.&quot;   And so, he says, little by little, Corumba, like Brazil,is being overrun by drugs. &quot;What's the use of seizing a fewgrams {by raiding bocas} while kilos and kilos are comingthrough the borders?&quot; he asks during a surprise -- andfruitless -- raid near the border. &quot;What's the use of doingan operation like this if the jails are so full you can'tsend anyone there?&quot; Ten or 20 years from now, he adds, &quot;wecould be another Colombia.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
