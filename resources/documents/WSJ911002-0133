Saddam Hussein's nuclear program was far more extensivethan anyone previously believed, cost perhaps $10 billion,involved hundreds of scientists and included uraniumenrichment and weapons development, according to theinspectors. &quot;You walk around those sites and you shake yourhead because they're far better than most I've seen -- thanall I've seen in Europe or North America,&quot; said U.N. teamleader David Kay on Monday.</LP><TEXT>   Yet in Washington such news is barely audible amid theclamor for unilateral disarmament. Instead of a chance toselect priorities, President Bush's decision to eliminatesome nuclear weapons is being welcomed as a chance to cuteverything. George Mitchell, the Senate Majority Leader,joined Ted Kennedy in declaring that &quot;we should not bewasting our resources on 75 B-2 bombers&quot; or anti-missiledefenses. These are the two systems President Bushspecifically said he wants to continue.   Paul Tsongas, speaking for the party's presidentialcandidates, said he failed &quot;to understand why the Presidentis proposing that we dismantle already built weapons systems,only to replace them with new military hardware.&quot; Even SamNunn wants to mothball B-1 bombers and build so few B-2s thatthey'd become even more expensive per copy.   Apparently these Democrats think the world's threats havevanished with the Soviet Union. Saddam Hussein must think hisonly mistake was invading his neighbors too soon, while thefoolish Americans still had the firepower to defeat him.   Now, we hardly think that all U.S. defense spending issacrosanct; the Army in particular will not be fighting anylarge-scale land wars soon. But don't our politiciansremember the last Era of Global Good Feeling, the 1920s and1930s? The disarming of peaceful democracies, including theU.S., gave tyrants the opening they needed. U.S. defensetechnology atrophied while Hitler and Japan advanced tosuperiority. By the time the West awoke, the tyrants thoughtthey could use their power for political gain, amiscalculation that led to war.   History suggests such threats don't vanish forever. Thecommunist collapse is a monumental event, but the nature of afuture Russian union is far from certain. Even if all goeswell, Russia is likely to emerge in 10 or 15 years with asmaller but more efficient and more technologically advancedmilitary.   The sophistication of Iraq's nuclear program shows thatCongress's view of the Third World as little more thanunskilled wogs and farmers also isn't serious. Thenon-Russian world contains India, China, Indonesia, Braziland Iran. They are smart, some even as smart as Senators frommodern Maine, and are going to pursue modern technology. Andin a world where technology spreads fast, some surely willget hold of technology to build nuclear missiles that can hitcountries without anti-missile defenses.   The U.S. ought to prepare now for threats likely to emergeover the next five to 15 years. That means devotingsignificant sums to defense research, and enough money to buyat least some new weapons so our military can keep current onthe tactics of war. The B-2's stealth ability is arevolutionary advance that can give the U.S. a20-or-more-year comparative advantage over enemy airdefenses; the recent flap over its stealthiness is by allcredible accounts minor. A posse of B-2s, flown from a securebase in the U.S., could project power virtually anywhere inthe world within hours.   Missile defenses can deter a Saddam with a bomb, a worryjust as real for the Russians these days. The Democratic leftand its hangers-on say this threat isn't &quot;close.&quot; But recallthat before the war Saddam came close to deploying asatellite in orbit. One under-publicized portion of Mr.Bush's speech last week called on the Soviets to renegotiatethe Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty; this would make bothcountries safer than any number of future START treaties.   We doubt most Democrats really dislike these weapons;they'd just rather spend the money on their own vote-buyingpork and social programs, including unneeded military bases.The Commander in Chief, however, has a broader responsibilityfor the common defense. Even before his latest cuts,President Bush had planned to slash defense spending by 25%through 1996, to the lowest level since 1939. Having nowdescribed the weapons we can do without, he will have torally Americans to pay for those we still need.</TEXT></DOC>
