Based on the data andinformation considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance will protectthe public health. Therefore, the tolerance is established as set forthbelow.Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days afterpublication of this document in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, file written objections with the Hearing Clerk,at the address given above. Such objections should specify the provisionsof the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections.A hearing will be granted if the objections are supported by grounds legallysufficient to justify the relief sought.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levelsor establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certificationstatement to this effect was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticidesand pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 7, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Douglas D.
