Some come in contactwith toxic materials. Some even die of workplace injuries. In thisfirst story of an AP Extra series, ``Danger at Work,'' MidwestRegional Reporter Sharon Cohen describes the pain that comes withthe paycheck for a growing number of workers.</TEXT><BYLINE>By SHARON COHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   In 18{ years in a meatpacking plant, Dave Kellen's wages havehelped build his house, put food on the table and raise twodaughters. But, he says, he has paid a terrible price: the use ofhis hands.   Kellen's hands are too weak to chop wood, much less twist open abottle. He blames it on years of such jobs as tearing gobs of fatfrom hogs, repeating the same few steps, struggling to keep pacewith hundreds of carcasses an hour.   His employer, John Morrell andamp; Co., says plant safety is improvingand is contesting a $4.3 million government fine for allegedlyallowing dangerous work conditions. Meanwhile, Kellen, 41, who hasendured surgery twice on each hand, now sweeps floors at the SiouxFalls, S.D., plant. And he's worried.   ``I'm sitting here with my hands 37 percent crippled. They'rewhat's got to make my living for the next 20 years,'' he said. ``IsMorrell going to be there? Are my hands going to get worse? I don'tknow who'd be willing to hire me. That's what's got me scared. ...It's like going blind slowly.''   Such problems go beyond one man, one company or one occupation.   Many union, safety and academic experts say Kellen is an exampleof an insidious trend in American industry: Companies are producingmore, cutting payrolls, modernizing, computerizing _ and creating amore hazardous workplace.   ``People are getting hurt more than they ever were,'' arguesJoseph Kinney, director of the National Safe Workplace Institute.``They're under more pressure to produce than they ever were. A lotof companies that once were using seven workers to do a job are nowasking five to do it.   ``The new fat-free American business syndrome is asking thosewho are left to do too damn much.''   Similar concerns have surfaced from congressional hearings tounion organizing drives, in auto, meatpacking, construction, steeland other industries. Experts say automation, competition and thechanging business landscape play a role.   ``We live in a time of corporate downsizing, mergers andacquisitions and leveraged buyouts that end or greatly diminishmany of the modest safety and health programs that exist,'' said aSeptember report by the workplace institute. ``The raiders anddownsizers are unwitting participants in our industrial carnage.''   While most workers no longer confront sweatshop horrors andarchaic equipment, some experts say a new trend in which technologyallows experienced employees to be replaced by those with lesstraining has contributed to increasing dangers.   Others disagree, noting large investments that companies,including the Big Three automakers, are making to improve plantdesigns. They also cite giant government penalties against lead,paper, meatpacking, construction and other firms that are servingas a deterrent.   ``I think workplaces are generally safer,'' said BerrienZettler, deputy director of compliance programs at the OccupationalSafety and Health Administration.   Kinney's group says OSHA has improved, but he cites governmentnumbers: the average number of workdays lost due to on-the-jobaccidents for each 100 workers rose from 58.5 days in 1983 to 69.9days in 1987.   And the National Safety Council says permanent work-relateddisabilities rose from 60,000 in 1986 to 70,000 in 1987.   Safety experts speculate conditions may be even grimmer becausecompanies underreport injuries to avoid OSHA inspections. In fact,the government has cited Union Carbide Corp., USX Corp. and othersfor alleged recordkeeping violations.   Ironically, some trace rising injuries to economic prosperity,especially in steel. One steelworkers' local says its injury ratenearly doubled when overtime peaked.   ``When you're tired and you work in a dangerous operation,fatigue is going to lead to accidents,'' said Mike Wright, theUnited Steelworkers of America's health and safety director.   A 1988 University of Texas study found nearly 93 percent ofinjury increases in durable goods industries could be explained byovertime and employee turnover.   Those aren't the only culprits.   ``Automation is increasing and the workers who performed avariety of the jobs are being replaced by machinery,'' said BobHall, research director at the Institute for Southern Studies inNorth Carolina.   ``The jobs that are left are not as complicated ... (and)increasingly treat people as robots ... (and treat) arms and handslike they're part of a machine. But you can't oil a person's arm orhand.''   Workers who cut, chop or pull thousands of times daily havedeveloped painful and sometimes disabling hand, arm and wristailments, known as repetitive trauma disorders. The most severeform is called carpal tunnel syndrome, a thickening or swelling oftendons in the wrist.   Repetitive trauma disorder cases _ including hearing loss _soared from 26,700 to 72,940 from 1983 to 1987, the governmentsays, though some attribute part of that to heightened awareness.   Much publicity has focused on meatpacking where, the United Foodand Commercial Workers Union says, production jumped nearly 20percent in the last five years while production employees droppedby almost 10,000.   ``When line speeds are increased and the workforce is decreasedin the name of efficiency, injuries go up,'' said Debbie Berkowitz,the union's health and safety director.   Meat and poultry workers, some of whom have testified beforeCongress, have complained about treacherously fast productionlines, where meat flies off damaged conveyor belts and bloodsplatters in their faces. They have described cysts, infections andcrippling hand and back pains that make it hard to lift theirchildren, comb their hair or hold a glass.   Former poultry employee Lillie Watson worked as a packer and legcutter for nearly a decade, making thousands of cuts a day. She hadsurgery three times on her hands, has arthritic legs and says shecan't scrub floors or lift heavy pots.   ``I feel bitter and angry,'' she said. ``Ain't no job I can getwhere I can use my hands occasionally.''   Workers such as Miss Watson often don't have many options,either because of the scarcity of job opportunities or limitededucation.   Another injured worker, Bev Whaley, said she had surgery on herright hand because of her job at the Morrell plant in Sioux Falls.She said a doctor told her she'd have to ``learn to live with it. Iwanted to take a baseball bat and smash his hands and tell him he'dhave to learn to live with it.''   Her union local claims assembly line speeds have increased inmany areas; for example, in the beef kill department _ where theanimal is knocked out, its throat slit, the hide pulled off and thebody split in half _ the hourly rate jumped from 105 an hour in1979 to 193 in 1986.   Said co-worker Kellen, ``You're just pushed to the limit,''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
