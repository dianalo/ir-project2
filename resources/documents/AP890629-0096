Any of the three could lead the court to re-evaluate its 1973 Roevs. Wade decision, which said women have a constitutional right toseek and obtain abortions.   The court already is assessing a woman's abortion rights in aMissouri case called Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services. Nodecision was announced in the Webster case today, but the court saidits 1988-89 term will end on Monday.   A decision could come then, or the justices could choose torequest new arguments during the next term.   If one or more of the other three cases is granted review beforethe end of the court's current term or early in the 1989-90 termthat begins next October, a decision likely would be announcedsometime in 1990.   Of the three pending cases, the Illinois dispute might affect Roevs. Wade most directly. It would be extremely difficult for thecourt to revive the Illinois laws without substantially dismantlingits 1973 decision.   Th's accident, fishermen were freetoday to harvest shellfish from parts of the upper Narragansett Bay.Officials said almost all the oil had evaporated.   In two other spills, cleanup crews made headway in mopping up oil.   Iakovos Georgudis 43, was charged Wednesday with two misdemeanorcounts of discharging pollutants into the water in violation of theClean Water Act and Federal Refuse Act. The captain also is underinvestigation by a state grand jury.   Each misdemeanor carries up to a year in prison and a $100,000fine or double the actual damages, said U.S. Attorney LincolnAlmond. The Coast Guard has estimated damages at $1.6 million, andGov. Edward D. DiPrete said President Bush has promised full federalreimbursement to the state.   The Clean Water Act prohibits the negligent discharge ofpollutants; the Refuse Act prohibits unlawfully discharging refuseinto navigable water without a permit.   Almond said that Georgudis, a Greek resident, was arrestedbecause of concern that he might leave the United States. The UnitedStates' extradition treaty with Greece does not cover pollutioncrimes, he said.   A federal magistrate set bail at $50,000 and ordered him tosurrender his passport. The magistrate also ordered that the captainand his Greek tanker World Prodigy remain in Rhode Island waters.   Almond said Georgudis was confined to the ship ``to insure theintegrity of the vesssel.''   Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, witnesses at a Coast Guard inquiryinto a spill of about 300,000 gallons on the Delaware River said abotched anchoring procedure led to the grounding of a tanker and thespill of industrial heating oil. The hearing was recessed until July5.   The focus of the cleanup shifted today as changing winds directedthe oil from the Delaware side of the river toward New Jersey. Bythis morning, 98 oil-covered birds had been brought to a rescuecenter near Wilmington, Del.   Coast Guard officials said the cleanup was going well partlybecause rain and cooler weather helped congeal the oil, which hadbegun to liquefy in the hot sun Tuesday. As of 8 p.m. Wednesday,146,500 gallons of the estimated 306,000 gallons spilled had beenrecovered, the Coast Guard said.   In Texas, crews were nearly finished cleaning up a 250,000-gallonoil spill that occurred Friday when a tanker and a barge collided inthe Houston Ship Channel, but the process has slowed a bit,officials said.   Only about 840 of the 252,000 gallons of oil that leaked remainedon the water this morning, but most of the slick was difficult toreach, the Coast Guard said.   Georgudis, who has admitted to Rhode Island's governor and CoastGuard officials that he made a mistake in navigation, would not becalled to testify before a joint hearing by the Coast Guard and theNational Transportation Safety Board, said the chief investigator,Coast Guard Capt. David Whitten.   Whitten said Georgudis intends to invoke his Fifth Amendmentright to protect against self-incrimination.   The World Prodigy's chief engineer, who does not faceprosecution, was expected to testify today. But Whitten said theU.S. attorney's office had indicated that testimony by the chiefmate and helmsman could be delayed because of an unexplained snag inobtaining immunity from prosecution.   U.S. Attorney Lincoln C. Almond said only that he was trying toobtain approval for grants of immunity from Washington. He said hedid not know how long it would take.   Georgudis' lawyer has said the captain would invoke the FifthAmendment if brought before the grand jury, which is investigatingpossible violations of state pollution laws and a law requiringharbor pilots aboard ships within Narragansett Bay.   On Tuesday, helmsman Konstadinos Paraskevopulos invoked the FifthAmendment before the grand jury. But after being granted immunity,he testified Wednesday. He declined to comment afterward.   Georgudis also declined to comment.   He said little during the hearing before U.S. Magistrate JacobHagopian except to acknowledge that he spoke English and understoodthe charges.   Coast Guard Lt. Paul Wolf said the unloading of almost 8 milliongallons of oil remaining aboard the ship had been completed to fivebarges, where the fuel would be purified.</TEXT></DOC>
