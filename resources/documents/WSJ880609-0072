Several studies of the October stock market crash have recommended forms of cross margining to reduce traders' cash requirements and enhance market liquidity. The concept has been endorsed in general terms by both the futures and options industries.    But the pilot program is limited in scope as well as time. The Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which account for three-fourths of U.S. futures trading, aren't members of the securities industry-dominated ICC and therefore aren't participating in the program.    John Davidson, Chicago Merc vice president-clearing, said it was &quot;too early to tell how or when&quot; the exchange might join in a cross-margining program with the ICC. Roger Rutz, president of the Board of Trade Clearing Corp., said that the Board of Trade wasn't planning on joining the ICC program, preferring instead to apply for the right to clear securities and options itself.    Included in the ICC are the New York Stock Exchange and its New York Futures Exchange affiliate; the American Stock Exchange and its Amex Commodities Corp.; the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and its Philadelphia Board of Trade affiliate; the Chicago Board Options Exchange; the Pacific Stock Exchange; and the National Association of Securities Dealers. </TEXT></DOC>
