Ioxaglate contained 160 mg/ml of iodine(ER-61) was used for digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and its clinicalusefulness was examined. The osmolality of this new drug, ER-61, is keptas same as that of plasma. A total of 194 patients was examined for 517times, 125 males and 69 females, aged 10 to 85 years. DSA of ER-61 wasrather limited to intraarterial studies. The quality of vascular opacificationwas excellent or good in 507 (98 %) of 517 studies. As adverse reactions,heat sensation was complained in 98 studies (19 %) and pain in 11 (2%). Other adverse reactions were found in only 10 (5 %) of 194 cases.ER-61 produced no significant effect on blood cell count and blood chemistrytest. In conclusion, isotonic ioxaglate (ER-61) has sufficient contrastenhancement without significant adverse reactions and is proved to bea very useful contrast material for digital subtraction angiography.</TEXT></DOC>
