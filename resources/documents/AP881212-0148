(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Imprisoned New Jersey mob chief Anthony``Tony Pro'' Provenzano, a prime suspect in the disappearance ofex-Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa, died Monday of a heart attack. He was71.   Provenzano died at at Lompoc District Hospital, near the federalprison where he was serving a 20-year term for two racketeeringconspiracy offenses, said Chuck LaRoe, spokesman for themaximum-security prison 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles. He hadbeen confined to the hospital for treatment of congestive heartfailure.   In July 1975, Hoffa disappeared while on his way to a Detroitmeeting with Provenzano, who was then president of Teamsters Local560 in New Jersey. Hoffa is presumed dead, but his body was neverfound.   According to an FBI memo, Hoffa and Provenzano had feuded whenboth were in federal prison. The FBI speculated that Hoffa had hopedto make peace with Provenzano and forge an alliance that would aidhis drive to regain power.   New Jersey State Police listed Provenzano as a soldier in theGenovese crime family who was a close associate of Hoffa in theearly 1960s. The report also said Provenzano and former Genovesefamily members were ``primary suspects in Hoffa's disappearance.''   The Mafia Encyclopedia, written by Carl Sifakis, said Provenzanowas responsible for Hoffa's disappearance.   ``According to the FBI reconstruction of the Hoffa murder, `TonyPro' called the so-called peace parlay with Hoffa and then orderedhim killed. Provenzano denied even being in Detroit at the time, andseemed to go out of his way to seal an airtight alibi,'' theencyclopedia said.   One of Provenzano's Teamster rivals, Local 560 dissident AnthonyCasellito, was garroted with piano wire 23 years ago. The threeProvenzano brothers, Anthony, Salvatore and Nunzio, all have beenimprisoned for a variety of crimes, including racketeering andextortion.   Provenzano was installed shop steward in a trucking company in1945, and by 1950 he was a Teamster organizer and eventually becamepresident of Local 560. The encyclopedia said he presided overbookmaking, numbers and loan sharking run by his business agents andstop stewards.   LaRoe said Provenzano was sentenced to four years in prison by ajudge in the federal court's Southern District in New York on July11, 1978, then on July 10, 1979, in the district of New Jersey toanother 20 years.   ``He had a tentative release date of Aug. 13, 1992, and hadwaived parole consideration,'' said LaRoe.   A resident of Hallendale, Fla., Provenzano began his sentence atLompoc on Nov. 18, 1980.</TEXT></DOC>
