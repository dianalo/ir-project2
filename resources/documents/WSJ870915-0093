Kurt Koegler, an attorney who represents a committee formed to consider the competing bids, said management's bid &quot;seems quite certain of being realized.&quot; He said the $19-a-share bid by restaurant operator Anwar S. Soliman was &quot;ephemeral.&quot;    Mr. Koegler, an attorney at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher andamp; Flom, said the main barrier to Mr. Soliman's proposal is that a group holding 48% of the company has agreed to vote against his bid. Mr. Koegler said this stake is held by Martin Brody, chairman and chief executive officer; Max Pine, president and chief operating officer, and another person whom he wouldn't identify.    In Newport Beach, Calif., Mr. Soliman said that he was &quot;surprised and disappointed&quot; by the decision and that his bid remains outstanding.    The management group said it will begin a tender offer this week for all of the company's approximately 5.1 million Class A and Class B shares outstanding. But the company wouldn't comment on whether it had received financing for the offer.    Restaurant Associates operates theme and specialty restaurants such as Acapulco Restaurants and Charlie Brown's, and office building newsstands.    In composite trading yesterday on the American Stock Exchange, the Class A shares closed at $17.75, up $2.625, while the Class B shares closed at $17.75, up $2.375.    As previously reported, the company rejected management's earlier $16-a-share offer at a board meeting last week and said it continued to consider Mr. Soliman's proposal. Mr. Soliman said the board rejected his offer at that meeting, but the company contended that it didn't. </TEXT></DOC>
