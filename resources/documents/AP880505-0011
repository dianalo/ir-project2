But the pastoral scene masks one of Canada's worstenvironmental hazards: acid shock.   Each spring as the snow melts, airborne pollutants thataccumulated over the winter in the boreal forest are flushed intothe lakes of eastern Canada, causing up to 100 times the normallevel of acidity and killing the fish.   ``Lakes in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada are under siege,''federal Environment Minister Tom McMillan told reporters whotraveled an hour north of Quebec City to Montmorency Forest thisweek to observe the acid shock phenomenon at Lake Laflamme.   McMillan said half the acid rain and snow falling thereoriginates from U.S. smokestack emissions and vehicle exhausts, andhe repeated Canada's demand for U.S. legislation to slash thoseemissions under a fixed timetable.   The offending sulfates and nitrates have killed all fish life in14,000 Canadian lakes and another 150,000 lakes are beingacidified, he said.   ``It's the North American continent's No. 1 environmentalproblem. Together, we must act to defeat it. If we don't, it willdefeat us,'' the minister said.   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney made the same plea last month toPresident Reagan and Congress, but won only a promise for moretalks.   ``We didn't think it was going to be easy to convince apresident who had attributed acid rain to trees and ducks andvolcanoes,'' said McMillan.   The Reagan administration argues that more cause-and-effectresearch is needed before billions of dollars are spent onsmokestack filters and scrubbers and other measures to curb the 3.2million metric tons a year of sulfur dioxide flowing across theborder from the United States.   Since 1980, a team of 40 Canadian scientists has used LakeLaflamme as an acid shock laboratory to develop the world's firstcomputer model on the amount of acid pollution that can beanticipated during spring run-off.   But ironically, the government-organized visit to the tiny,remote lake underlined U.S. reservations over Canada's tough standon acid rain.   For one thing, the United States plans to spend far more moneyon acid rain research than Canada.   Reagan agreed in 1986 to ask Congress for $2.5 billion U.S. overfive years to develop clean-coal technology, with an equal amountcoming from industry. Little has been appropriated thus far, but itwas a commitment.   In Canada, seven federal departments spend a total of just $18million ($14.5 million U.S.) a year on acid rain.   McMillan said this did not take provincial spending into accountbut added: ``One of the problems in the United States is thatresearch has become a buzzword for, `We're not going to do anythingabout the problem itself.'''   Mulroney and McMillan often assert that acid rain is damagingCanada's forests. But Claude Godbout, research director at theQuebec Ministry of Energy and Resources, said there is ``noscientific proof'' of such damage.   Thousands of dead trees along the road to Lake Laflamme fellprey to spruce budworm, not acid rain, Godbout said. ``There's beenan epidemic since 1970. But there is some suspicion that acid rainweakened the trees.''   McMillan claimed the Canadian maple syrup industry may collapsewithin 10 years because of maple die back in which acid rain is a``major factor.'' But Godbout said high concentrations of ozone maycause more damage.   Godbout nevertheless favored reductions in acid rain emissions.He quoted the French philosopher Pascal's aphorism on the existenceof God: ``If heaven exists and I am a Christian, I win. If I am nota Christian, I lose. I can't take the gamble. It's the same withacid rain.''   Despite its high acidity, Lake Laflamme still supports 2,000brook trout. Scientists measure acidity and alkalinity on a pHscale from 0 to 14, with 7 representing neutrality and less than 7showing increased acidity. Lakes generally need a pH of 5.0 orabove to sustain fish life.   The pH at Lake Laflamme dips to 3.9 during spring run-off andstill supports life.   Researchers explained that every lake is different, and manyfactors are involved in destroying life, including the degree ofacid shock in springtime, and the content and buffering ability ofthe nearby soil and lake bed.</TEXT></DOC>
