(NASDe in Rockville, Md.andO;&quot;Then, as the straw that broke the camel's back, came Black Monday.andP;  Suddenlythere was an even greater urgency to do whatever it took to restoreinvestors' confidence in the market.&quot;andM;At about this same time, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) hired JohnFischer Jr., a Wall Street veteran who had spent the previous six yearsbuilding integrated trading systems at Smith Barney, Harris Upham in New YorkCity.andP;  Fischer's new assignment, as vice president of regulatory systems, wasto put in place at the exchange what was termed &quot;the next generation oftechnology across all regulatory functions.&quot;andM;A Technology BingeandM;The NYSE has been on something of a technology binge lately.andP;  Under theleadership of chairman and chief executive officer John J. Phelan Jr., who isretiring at the end of this year, the exchange has sunk nearly $200 millioninto technology over the past five years.andP;  Not all of that has gone intoregulatory and surveillance systems.andP;  But, being crucial parts of what theexchange does, market surveillance and regulation have garnered aseveral-million-dollar share of the exchange's technology investment.andM;Indeed, the two years since Black Monday have witnessed a rash of systemsdevelopment across the entire securities industry--much of it aimed atautomating and upgrading a plethora of surveillance mechanisms used tomonitor the many facets of securities trading.andP;  NASD, for example, hiredprofessors Keith Ord and Samuel Davis of Pennsylvania State University inState College, Pa., and Nobel laureates Robert Solow and Franco Modigliani ofthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass., to create amore sophisticated mathematical model for detecting abnormal trading activityin any given NASD security.andP;  That model is now part of NASD's automaticStock-Watch program.andM;The American stock Exchange (AMEX) and the New York Stock Exchange joined ina similar effort, along with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) andthe Securities Industry Association (SIA).andP;  This led to a scheme forelectronic filing of Blue Sheets, the questionnaires that the SEC sends tobrokers when it requires more detailed information on a specific security.andM;Although many of these projects are designed to be used across the spectrumof market regulation and surveillance activities, it is insider trading thatremains a focus of special attention.andP;  Both NASD and the NYSE have developeddatabases of specialized information that, they hope, will be useful intracking down inside traders.andP;  NASD's data file, called the Retail AccountName Search, includes information on individuals who have been the subject ofpast insider-trading investigations.andM;The NYSE uses a similarr database called the Unusual Activity File.andP;  But ithas also developed a more ambitious data file called the Automated Search andMatch System (ASAM).andP;  ASAM houses more than a million records on individuals,including active traders, company directors, investment bankers, lawyers andaccountants--in short, anyone who might be involved in an acquisition or aleveraged buy-out and, therefore, privy to inside information.andP;  Using arelational database manager from Sybase Inc., of Emeryville, Calif.,andO;surveillance analysts search for matches among the ASAM files in such commonfields as zip codes, alma maters or membership at the same sports or countryclub--venues or relationships that might conceivably be conducive to sharingillegal stock tips.andM;The Need To IntegrateandM;All of these tools are of limited use, however, unless the information can bebrought together in a single spot.andP;  Until NASD consolidated all of itssurveillance information on a Sun Microsystems Inc. workstation last year,analysts had to run around the office collecting data from differentterminals and paper files.andP;  &quot;There were times when different analysts mightbe working on the same investigation and not even know it,&quot; says NASD'sSamarias.andM;The number of data elements and surveillance functions that must be knittogether is illustrated by the system that the NYSE has assembled--acomputerized approach to market regulation called the IntegratedComputer-Assisted Surveillance System (ICASS).andP;  ICASS has a UNIX-based,multivendor architecture that uses high-speed workstations to integrateinformation from a wide array of data sources.andP;  &quot;As such, it's a goodindicator of what we see as our next generation of technology for regulatorysystems,&quot; says Fischer, who notes that the system for tracking insidertrading is just one of several market-surveillance applications running underICASS.andM;One of the fundamental data files used by ICASS is the IntermarketSurveillance Information System (ISIS).andP;  ISIS was first developed seven yearsago and is now maintained by the Intermarket Surveillance Group (ISG), ajoint effort of the eight largest U.S.andP;  stock exchanges and NASD.andM;The ISIS database resides at one of the New York City data centers run by theSecurities Industries Automation Corp. (SIAC), the data-processingorganization that is jointly owned by the NYSE and the AMEX.andP;  The ISISdatabase--a 20-gigabyte sequential VM file--provides daily updates of alltransactions from the ISG member exchanges.andP;  Up to 90 days of transactionsare stored on line; data for longer periods are stored on tape.andP;  ISIS datalet surveillance analysts determine if a specific transaction was a trade ora quotation, whether it was used for a stock or an option, at which brokeragethe transaction occurred and whether it was for a member firm or a customer.andM;Trouble AlertandM;Although the NYSE uses ISIS as a data source, the exchange has its ownspecial program for monitoring every transaction on the securities market.andO;When a run up or some other unusual activity occurs with a security, an alertgoes into effect.andP;  The alert automatically triggers the second level of thesurveillance function: the analysis.andP;  The unusual activity is compared withthe normal volumes and ranges for the security.andP;  Analysts then call thecompany in question and consult public news reports to see if there has beenan announcement or other news event that might explain the unusual activity.andO;As part of its ICASS surveillance system, the NYSE maintains a news eventdatabase using a computerized news-indexing service to file items fromvarious business wire services, such as Dow Jones News/Retrieval.andM;When an unusual surge of activity cannot be explained by a recent news event,the third phase of the surveillance function kicks in: a full investigationby the NYSE's surveillance staff.andP;  At this point, Blue Sheet data, alsostored in a VM fil at the SIAC data center, are accessed.andP;  The Blue Sheetdata supply information on the individual customers involved in eachtransaction.andM;Who Did What--And WhenandM;If the analysts have reason to believe that trades may have been placed priorto the time an event became known to the public, they set about creatingspecial files to be used as part of their investigation.andP;  The analystscompile a chronology file by asking all parties involved in a deal, such asan acquisition or a leveraged buyout, to provide an account of just howevents unfolded.andP;  The surveillance staff ask such questions as who wasinvolved; when and where crucial agreements were reached; and who was privyto what information at each stage of the deal.andP;  The various chronologyreports are scanned and temporarily stored on a server in the ICASS network.andO;As part of their computerized sleuth work, analysts search for matchesbetween names in the chronology file, the ASAM file and the Blue Sheet files.andM;Officials at the NYSE refuse to disclose specific details of how analystsarrive at the conclusion that someone has probably profited illegally frominside information, although they do say it takes more than a simple matchupon two or more databases to point the finger of suspicion.andP;  At some point inthe investigation, a specially developed program called a &quot;suspicion-rankingalgorithm&quot; comes into play.andP;  If the suspicion ranking is high enough, thecase is turned over to the SEC.andM;One of the challenges facing the ICASS development team was to integrateinformation from a variety of data formats and operating systems and make iteasily accessible to surveillance analysts.andP;  For this, the NYSE installed Sunworkstations connected to an Ethernet local area network (LAN).andP;  Files fromUNIX-based applications are accessed directly by the workstations.andP;  Non-UNIXfiles, including the ISIS VM files, the ASAM MVS database and news wirefiles, are accessed with Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol(TCP/IP).andM;The Mouse as SleuthandM;Using an X Windows interface and a mouse, analysts can view and shareinformation from the various data services by pointing and clicking on files,including VM and MVS files.andM;Simply displaying the data on Sun workstations did not, in itself, constitutean insurmountable challenge.andP;  The ability to display a variety of market datafrom different sources and perform rapid calculations has won the Sunworkstation a niche on Wall Street in recent years as the preferredtechnology for trading workstations.andM;The market surveillance applications represent the first time Sunworkstations have been used in a financial application outside the tradingroom.andP;  But that did not pose any unique obstacles Fischer hadn't encounteredwhile building trading systems.andM;However, the volume of data needed to do a full investigation did require anevolution of the transmission links between the surveillance workstation andthe SIAC data center.andP;  Originally, the ICASS system relied on a terminalemulation connection between the Ethernet LAN and the IBM data center--a linkthat quickly proved inadequate.andP;  &quot;It's not unusual for a single case torequire 20 to 30 megabytes of data to be stored on servers on the ICASSnetwork,&quot; explains Fischer.andM;To accommodate this volume, the exchange upgraded the link to a T1 linedirectly attached to the VM and MVS machines at the SIAC data center.andP;  Aseparate Sun workstation was originally configured to handle protocolconversion at the data center.andP;  More recently, that Sun was replaced with thenew IBM 8232 protocol converter, which translates data directly from theEthernet into the IBM Systems Network Architecture (SNA) network.andP;  This makesSIAC's IBM 3090 mainframes appear as Ethernet servers to the Sunworkstations.andP;  Fischer regards this as a significant technical piece of thesolution to the ICASS network.andP;  &quot;It also reflects the kind of vendorcooperation that a network like this requires,&quot; he adds.andM;An even greater challenger to the ICASS system stemmed from the fact thatmany of the surveillance analysis tools--including the suspicion-rankingalgorithm and relational database calls to the chronology and ASAM datafiles--were to be distributed across the ICASS host-server network.andM;&quot;Integration doesn't come easy when it means dislodging the IS organizationfrom its traditional role,&quot; says Fischer.andP;  &quot;Integration becomes theresponsibility of the end-user environment, and the data center takes on therole of a host data server.andP;  But the tools that work well in a distributedenvironment conflict with those that work well in the data center.andP;  Then youhave a push-pull battle on your hands.&quot;andM;Support For a PrototypeandM;One way to bridge the traditional split between the data center environmentand the user camp is &quot;to build a working prototype and then seek a groundswell of support for that model from users,&quot; says Fischer.andP;  That's strategythat normally would conform well to have way IS responsibilities arepartitioned between the NYSE and SIAC.andP;  Traditionally it has been the job ofa development group like Fischer's to design a prototype system to users'satisfaction, after which it would be turned over to SIAC staff to implementin a production mode.andP;  In this case, however, it was necessary to enlist datacener involvement even in the development stage.andM;&quot;We were no longer talking about a point-to-point dial-up to the mainframe,&quot;says Fischer.andP;  &quot;We were dealing with a whole network with a series of dataservers on it.&quot;andM;Sensitive to the fact that the gap between the distributed end-userenvironment and the data center must be bridged, Fischer invited the SIACstaff to participate in the project on what he calls a &quot;hand-in-hand,day-in-day-out basis.andP;  There's a lot of smart people at SIAC.andP;  When invitedto address a challenge, they responded,&quot; says Fischer.andP;  Credit also goes towhat Fischer calls a cooperative effort by a team that included members notonly from SIAC and the exchange but from participating vendors and outsideconsultants.andM;The priority and urgency of the project cannot be downplayed as a factor inbringing team members together.andP;  &quot;Design and plans for this came from thehighest levels,&quot; says Fischer.andP;  &quot;It was a top priority project.andP;  There's nodoubt that helped forge the cooperation that was needed.&quot;andM;A Mainframe WindowandM;NASD's insider-trading surveillance system stopped short of distributing theactual analysis to Sun workstations.andP;  Unlike the more distributed NYSEsystem, most of the StockWatch and Automated Tracking (SWAT) system'sprocessing is handled in the NASD data center.andP;  A single Tandem processorwith four CPUs is dedicated to market surveillance, and three other Tandemsystems perform other tasks.andM;The NASD system uses manmy of the same data sources as the NYSE's ICASS: BlueSheet data, a computerized compilation of four business news wires (DowJones, Reuters, PR Wire and Business Wire) and automatic alerts generatedwhen NASD's StockWatch program identifies unusual trading activity ina security.andP;  For the most part, information from these various data sources isonly displayed, not processed, on the Sun workstation.andM;There are some other differences between the NYSE's ICASS system and NASD'sSWAT.andP;  Over the past two years, NASD has concentrated on upgrading SWAT andhas spent a little over $1 million on design, programming and testing.andP;  Overhalf of that went into the creation of the StockWatch component, whichincludes the mathematical model developed by the college professors.andP;  Thelatest version of SWAT includes an on-line module that monitors every stocktrade, quotation and news item as it occurs for variations in a stock's priceand volume.andP;  Another module looks for price and volume and other breaks overspecified periods.andM;Underlying AssumptionsandM;&quot;We put in a lot of preliminary research for the model developed by fourprofessors; then we put in a lot of additional research in order to refinethe calculations,&quot; says John DeSaix, director of systems development withinNASD's Automation Division.andP;  &quot;Any time you're relying on a statistical model,you have to make sure the underlying assumptions are valid.&quot;andM;NASD's decision to build SWAT around its Tandem mainframe can be explained inpart by the volume of market data that requires anslysis.andP;  NASD plans todevelop a historical database of every volume or price break that StockWatchflags as suspicious.andP;  &quot;The whole concept behind the SWAT program is to usethis data to further refine the model,&quot; says DeSaix.andM;NASD does plan to eventually distribute more analysis to the Sunworkstations.andP;  For example, historical data will be downloaded to theworkstation to do time series analyses.andP;  Only Blue Sheet analysis is nowbeing done on the workstations.andM;DeSaix says that by not distributing processing to the Sun workstations, NASDmay have avoided some potentially sticky administrative issues.andP;  &quot;It's whenyou start using the mainframe as a file server and distributing theprocessing out to users that you get into the organizational questions thatoften bog down a project like this--like how will the data be presented?&quot;andO;says DeSaix.andP;  &quot;We use multiple windows on the Sun, but it's not really a PCor Sun presentation.andP;  They are windows into the mainframe data.&quot;andM;Given the priority to market surveillance these days, it's questionablewhether organizational problems could haver seriously bogged down theproject, which had the backing of NASD's Technical Resources SteeringCommittee--a committee composed of the president and all executive vicepresidents.andP;  &quot;When it comes to makret surveillance, our organization is verysensitive,&quot; says NASD's Samarias.andP;  &quot;Everything we've asked for in terms offunding, personnel, resources and accommodations with other departments hasbeen granted.andP;  That helped us accomplish a lot in a short time.&quot;andM;David Stamps is a Minneapolis-based freelance writer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
