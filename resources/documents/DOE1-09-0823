The needs of new integral experiments are discussedwith respect to improvement of nuclear data for several materials interestingfor blankets. The choice problems of optimal set of activation detectorsfor unfolding procedure has been pointed out and solved. The resultsof its application in experiments with several assemblies representedblanket design concepts are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
