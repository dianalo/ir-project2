It's hard, infact, to recall any other TV production on the subject withas much dramatic heft. Much of its power is due to the scriptby David Brinkley -- a penetrating, rational and properlypassionate assessment of that famous Dec. 7. The footage isfresh, the pace such that even viewers used to this historyare likely to find themselves watching with racing hearts.This being a co-production of ABC News and the Japanesenetwork NHK, the film makers had access to a wealth ofJapanese sources and pictures. Japanese veterans of theattack have their say here, along with American survivors.There is, however, hardly a breath here -- give or take somemumbling from the odd interviewee -- of the increasinglyfashionable revisionist views on Pearl Harbor. In finalcomments Mr. Brinkley describes the U.S. as the country thathad preferred to stay home, but that ended up putting WesternEurope together, writing a new democratic constitution forJapan and standing off the Soviet Union till it collapsed --&quot;a heroic performance by one of history's great countries.&quot;That sums the matter up with a rare clarity.   9-11 p.m. EST, on ABC.                                                                                                                             Friday, Dec. 6                      Mozart on Tour                                                                                                          This musical ramble, filmed in London, Mantua, Salzburg,Vienna, Prague and various other sites, is an instructive --if also slightly ponderous -- travel chronicle of Mozart'scareer. The film begins with the Mozart family's first tourof the royal courts, in 1763. Host Andre Previn walks thestreets young Wolfgang once walked, but it is a journeyundermined by a script that is alternately leaden and arch.Still, what with biography and travel lore, not to mentionthe music, there is plenty here for the master's devotees.   9-11 p.m. EST, on PBS. PBS air dates and times vary socheck local listings.                     Saturday, Dec. 7                   Remember Pearl Harbor                                                                                                          This reasonably substantial, sometimes moving contributionto the Pearl Harbor remembrance canon is diminished by asoftness at its core, an over-heavy reliance on survivors'spiritual reflections, and speeches. It's perhaps hard toavoid the temptation to find sermons in the stones of PearlHarbor, and this production finds a lot of them, not all ofthem enlightening. The interview portions shine whenhistorian Thurston Clarke is on screen with his hectoringrecitals of the U.S. military's miscalculations, when a womanrecalls her experience as a young reporter in Hawaii, whenEric Sevareid talks about Japanese miscalculations about theAmerican will to fight, and in the hard factual recitals bysurvivors recalling details of the attack. General NormanSchwartzkopf co-hosts, brimful of his usual enthusiasm. Goodas it always is to see the general, his presence and style --which smacks overwhelmingly of the '90s and the Gulf War --is something of a miscalculation itself, tonally speaking.Host Charles Kuralt bridges the decades nicely, on the otherhand. Despite its flaws, the program's strengths areconsiderable, enough to put it close to the top of the lineupof Pearl Harbor documentaries airing Saturday.   8-10 p.m. EST, on CBS.                                                                                                                            Tuesday, Dec. 10               Nightmare in Columbia County                                                                                                          This fact-based tale, flavored with authentic Southernatmosphere, concerns a serial killer and a sheriff (WilliamDevane) determined to find him. Familiar as all this maysound, this film renders a taut story many cuts above theusual, thanks mainly to a relentlessly focused script (byJohn Robert Bensink, direction by Roger Young). The chasecomes to an end shortly before the film does, leaving thestory fizzling out toward the close, but no one shouldcomplain. It isn't every day that we get a made-for-TV filmcapable of maintaining suspense for more than an hour and ahalf.   9-11 EST, on CBS.                                                                                                                             Sunday, Dec. 15                  Death Hits the Jackpot                                                                                                          Even people who find Detective Columbo's coquettishnesswearying -- and there must be a lot of them -- can enjoy thisstory of a conniving jeweler who covets a relative's lotterywinnings. Rip Torn helps matters along in high style as themurdering uncle of a suddenly rich nephew.   9-11 p.m. EST, on ABC.                                                                                                                           Wednesday, Dec. 18                          Strays                                                                                                          Strictly for horror fans and maybe a select sort of catfancier, this fairly lively if revolting story of maraudingfelines boasts a terrific cat star by the name of Monty. Itis definitely not for the fainthearted -- be warned.   9-11 EST, on USA.</TEXT></DOC>
