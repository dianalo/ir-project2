This concept results in an overall vessel cost reduction of9.5% for a typical gasification vessel. Construction schedule savingswill also be estimated and resulting finance cost savings for a gasificationplant will be estimated. A qualitative estimate for the overall plantcost savings for a plant using larger vessels (as made practical by thisresearch) and therefore, fewer process trains will be made. The followingportions of the research have been completed: ADINA nonlinear analysisof the three models to predict failure pressures; fabrication and testingto failure of all models; comparison of analysis predictions vs actualtest results, (the models with the enhancement failed within 2% of astandard vessel); and estimated cost savings of 9.5% for heavy-wall vesselsutilizing this concept. The project description and future plans aregiven.</TEXT></DOC>
