SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United States has little interest in anypossible Soviet proposal at the Malta summit to restrict navalpower because such a step would hamper America's security and itsability to protect its allies, the State Department said Tuesday.   ``The Soviet Union, a land power, would be less constrained bysuch proposals'' than would the United States, said spokeswomanMargaret Tutwiler, adding, ``We are not aware of naval arms controlmeasures that enhance stability.''   The comments came as the Pentagon reported that the Soviets willhave four warships capable of carrying nuclear weapons in theMediterranean during this weekend's summit, contrary to a reportthat Moscow was withdrawing such ships in anticipation of apossible initiative to declare the region a nuclear-free zone.   Ms. Tutwiler, asked about reports that the Soviets might use themeeting between President Bush and and Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev to push a new initiative on naval arms control, said theSoviets ``may seek to make a virtue of necessity by proposingconstraints related to limitations on their own naval deployments.''   The spokeswoman noted that U.S. officials have observed aworldwide downturn in Sovet naval activity for some time and thatit apparently is due to operational problems and budget restraints.   Ms. Tutwiler said the United States has no indication that theSoviets intend to propose any naval cuts at the summit.   She stressed that the United States depends on freedom of theseas to protect its security and commercial interests, todemonstrate its support for its allies and to deter war.   ``We have opposed Soviet proposals for naval arms controlbecause they would hamper our ability to honor our commitments toour allies and carry out our global responsibility,'' she said.   At the Pentagon, officials reported that the Mediterranean willbe bristling with U.S. and Soviet naval power during the seawatersummit, with four Soviet nuclear-capable combat ships and threetimes as many such U.S. vessels in the region.   ``The Soviet Union is expected to have four nuclear-capablecombatants and four auxiliaries in the Med during the Maltameeting,'' spokesman Fred Hoffman told reporters.   Hoffman said the Soviet group is expected to include threeguided-missile frigates, the Slava guided-missile cruiser _ whichwill be the site of talks on Saturday between Bush and Gorbachev _and four support vessels.   Such ships are normally armed with a variety of missiles,including the SS-N-12 anti-ship cruise missile, the SA-N-6 airdefense missile and the SS-N-14 anti-submarine missile, saidanother Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Ken Satterfield.   The Navy is expected to have 25 ships in the Mediterraneanduring the summit. That includes the aircraft carrier USS Forrestaland the dozen destroyers, cruisers and frigates that compose itsbattle group.   Also in the area is an amphibious ready group composed of fiveships ready to deploy some 2,400 Marines, said a Navy spokesman,Cmdr. Craig Quigley.   Of the U.S. ships, 11 can carry nuclear weapons, Satterfieldsaid.   Hoffman, asked whether the U.S. ships would be so armed, refusedto say.   ``We neither confirm nor deny the existence of such weapons,''he said.   A defense official, who spoke on condition he not be named, saidthe Soviets ``still have a submarine presence'' in theMediterranean and are expected to continue to do so through theshipboard summit.   The two leaders are scheduled to share a dinner Saturday nightaboard the U.S. host vessel, the USS Belknap, the guided-missilecruiser that is a command ship for the U.S. Sixth Fleet in theMediterranean.</TEXT></DOC>
