The indivdual computing aspects of suchsystems are contrasted with the traditional centralized data processingaspect of corporate computing. An outline is made of how executive informationsystems effect decision making: they provide extremely timely information,personalize the information according to the manager's individual need,and are able to manipulate information as needed. A key part of thisprocess is the ability of the system to align itself to the factors thatare most critical to achieving the organization's objectives.
