On November 30, 1987, Chinook Chemicals Co.,Ltd., requested in accordance with andSection;353.53a(a) of the CommerceRegulations (1988) that we conduct an administrative review. We publisheda notice of initiation on December 15, 1987 (52 FR 47617). The Departmenthas now conducted that review in accordance with section 751 of the TariffAct of 1930 (``the Tariff Act'').<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Review</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule </T3>(``HTS''), as provided for in section1201 <T3>et seq. </T3>of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS item number(s).Imports covered by the review are shipments of choline chloride from Canada.Choline chloride is marketed in several forms including, but not limitedto, a solution of 70 percent choline chloride in water (aqueous cholinechloride) or in potencies of 50 to 60 percent dried on a cereal carrier.During the review period, such merchandise was classifiable under <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated </T3>(``TSUSA'') itemnumber 439.5055 and is currently classifiable under HTS item number 2923.10.00.The TSUSA and HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and customspurposes. The written description remains dispositive.The review covers Chinook Chemicals Co., Ltd., the only known manufacturerand/or exporter of Canadian choline chloride to the United States, andthe period November 17, 1986 through January 8, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price</ITAG>In calculating United States price we used purchase price, as defined insection 772 of the Tariff Act. Purchase price was based on the packed orunpacked, duty-paid, delivered price to unrelated purchasers in the UnitedStates. Where applicable, we made adjustments for U.S. and foreign inlandfreight, import duties, brokerage and handling charges, and discounts.No other adjustments were claimed or allowed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value</ITAG>In calculating foreign market value we used home market price, as definedin section 773 of the Tariff Act, since sufficient quantities of such orsimilar merchandise were sold in the home market to provide a basis forcomparison. Home market price was based on packed or unpacked, ex-factoryor delivered price to unrelated purchasers in Canada. We made adjustments,where applicable, for inland freight, credit, and indirect selling expenseswhen a commission was paid in one market and not the other. In accordancewith andSection;353.55 of the Commerce Regulations published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 28, 1989 (54 FR 12742) (to be codifiedat 19 CFR 353.55), we did not include sales of small quantities of aqueouscholine chloride in drums in calculating home market price. No other adjustmentswere claimed or allowed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Results of Review and Intent To Revoke</ITAG>As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine the weighted-averagedumping margin to be 0.0008 percent for Chinook Chemicals Co., Ltd., duringthe period November 17, 1986 through January 8, 1988.On January 8, 1988, we tentatively revoked the order with respect to Chinook(53 FR 548). However, since Chinook is the only known manufacturer/exportercovered by this order, we intend to revoke the entire order. If this revocationis made final, it will apply to all unliquidated entries of this merchandiseentered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the dateof publication of the tentative revocation.Interested parties may request disclosure within 5 days of the date ofpublication of this notice and may request a hearing within 10 days ofpublication. Any hearing, if requested will be held 45 days after the dateof publication, or the first workday thereafter. Pre-hearing briefs and/orwritten comments from interested parties may be submitted not later than30 days after the date of publication. Rebuttal briefs and rebuttals towritten comments, limited to issues raised in those comments, may be filednot later than 37 days after the date of publication.The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumpingduties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences between UnitedStates price and foreign market value may vary from the percentage statedabove. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly tothe Customs Service.This administrative review, intent to revoke, and notice are in accordancewith sections 751(a)(1) and (c) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675 (a)(1)and (c)) and andSection;353.22 of the new Commerce Department's Regulations.Because the tentative revocation was published (53 FR 548, January 8, 1988)prior to the effective date of the Commerce Regulations published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 28, 1989, we are proceeding with theintent to revoke pursuant to 19 CFR 353.54 (1988).<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 4, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lisa B.
