After induction of transformed cells, the crude solubleextract was found to contain a new protein immunoreactive with {beta}-polymeraseantibody and corresponding in size to the protein deduced from the cDNA.This protein was purified in a yield of 1-2 mg/50 g of cells. The recombinantprotein had about the same DNA polymerase specific activity as {beta}-polymerasepurified from mammalian tissues, and template-primer specificity andimmunological properties of the recombinant polymerase were similar tothose of natural {beta}-polymerases. The purified enzyme was free ofnuclease activity. The authors studied detailed catalytic propertiesof the recombinant {beta}-polymerase using defined template-primer systems.The results indicate that this {beta}-polymerase is essentially identicalwith natural {beta}-polymerases. The recombinant enzyme is distributivein mode of synthesis and is capable of detecting changes in the integrityof the single-stranded template, such as methylated bases and a double-strandedregion. The enzyme recognizes a template region four to seven bases downstreamof the primer 3' end and utilizes alternative primers if this downstreamtemplate region is double stranded. The enzyme is unable to synthesizepast methylated bases N{sup 3}-methyl-dT or O{sup 6}-methyl-dG.</TEXT></DOC>
