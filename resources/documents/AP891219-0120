Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Israel informedthe United States of the oil deal a month ago. She declined to saywhether the United States approved of the deal.   ``Foreign countries do not seek U.S. approval for oil purchasesfrom a third country,'' she added.   The United States has no diplomatic relations with Iran and isworried about the possibility of Iranian-backed terrorist incidentsagainst American targets in Europe or Africa during the holidayseason.   Iran is one of six countries which, according to the StateDepartment, supports international terrorism.   NBC News disclosed the oil transaction Monday night, saying thatIsrael paid Iran $36 million and that one purpose was to encourageIran to use its influence to help free three Israeli soldiers beingheld in Lebanon.   The United States is backing the deal in hopes that it couldlead to the release of American hostages held in Lebanon, NBC said.   Ms. Tutwiler said the United States does not make deals for therelease of U.S. hostages, but she refused to offer an opinion as towhether there is any objection to Israel carrying out negotiationson behalf of the hostages.   In addition to winning the radical Moslem country's help inseeking the release of Israelis, the oil purchases and a potentialspare parts deal are intended to bolster Iran's position against acommon enemy, Iraq, NBC said.   Iran's Islamic fundamentalist leaders are generally hostile toIsrael but the country's struggling economy is sorely in need offoreign currency.   Spokesmen for Israel's Energy, Foreign and Defense ministries onTuesday refused to comment on the report. The Defense Ministry alsorefused to allow reporters to talk to Uri Lubrani, mentioned in theNBC report as the man who dealt with the Iranians in Switzerland.   Lubrani is responsible for Israel's Lebanon policy and served asambassador to Iran before the revolution that swept AyatollahRuhollah Khomeini to power.   Joseph Alpher of the Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center forStrategic Studies, executive editor of the center's annual ``MiddleEast Military Balance'', said Israel had other considerations thatcould justify ties with Iran, apart from seeking the release of itsprisoners.   ``Iraq is getting stronger every day by acquiring chemical andnon-conventional arms that threaten us,'' Alpher said on IsraelTelevision. ``There is a reason to see to it that Iran can continueconfronting and diversing the Iraqi forces.''   ``Beyond that, Iran has oil, Iran has Jews and all these aregood reasons for renewal of connections with Iran, without anyrelation to the governing regime,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
