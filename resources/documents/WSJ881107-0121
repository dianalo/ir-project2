Before flipping the lever for the same old pol, however, it may be time for voters to take a moment and ask themselves just what they're getting from these entrenched aristocrats.    Many Members undoubtedly have been bragging to voters about two of the great, publicized &quot;accomplishments&quot; of the 100th Congress -- the catastrophic health-care bill and the drug bill. One of the entrenched, Rep. Fortney &quot;Pete&quot; Stark called the catastrophic bill &quot;the most important health legislation for our nation's elderly&quot; since 1965. The drug bill, of course, is Congress's idea of fighting the war on crack and criminals. Voters should take a closer look at the kind of handiwork Congressmen now perform.    &quot;Our nation's elderly&quot; have already started to look at Rep. Stark's catastrophic care bill, and they aren't impressed. They're furious. Their anger is targeted on the new &quot;supplemental premium&quot; that more than 40% of Medicare beneficiaries will pay to finance the bill's $30 billion cost the next five years. The new Medicare supplemental premium is in fact a new surtax on the elderly -- rising by 1993 to $42 per $150 of tax liability, with a $2,100 ceiling per couple. (At and below these prices, comparable private-sector insurance has been available.)    Some Members, such as Reps. Armey, Dannemeyer and Archer, argued hard against the tax increase during the House floor debate June 2. The opposition stood by its tax increase. John Dingell, one of the most deeply entrenched, said: &quot;The financing will be generated by a tax imposed according to one's income.&quot; Carl Levin: &quot;We have shown that we can redistribute the financing of these reforms more fairly.&quot; &quot;Progressive financing,&quot; Don Bonker called it. Rep. William Coyne on the true meaning of deficit-reduction: &quot;These added premiums will impose significant burdens on many of the elderly, but are intended to preserve the availability of general tax revenues for other critical programs and for deficit reduction.&quot; Tom Downey: &quot;It recognizes the fiscal realities of the later years of the 20th century.&quot;    Now we suppose there is a legitimate argument over whether the elderly, or any benefiting constituency, should help foot the bill for a new expansion of federal largesse. But we don't recall Congress ever putting that question to their elderly constituents. They passed this multibillion-dollar bill, passed the tax, and now they want their constituents to cough up the payments, keep quiet and send them back to Congress. Maybe voters should ask, will the entrenched incumbents return to do for everyone else's taxes what they've just done to 40% of the elderly?    No one had to ask voters if they wanted Congress's help in the war on drugs. On October 27, not far from the Capitol building itself, Washington recorded its 287th homicide this year. It was drug-related. The local press reported: &quot;As the screaming onlookers tried to flee the second shooting, police arrived and one of the gunmen drove away in a four-wheel drive vehicle, rammed a D.C. police car, circled the block back to the scene of the gun battle and then opened fire on several other officers before crashing into a parked car.&quot; Six days earlier the Members had passed the drug bill that so many of them are now promising voters will do something about the murder and violence that is destroying city neighborhoods.    Voters should ask the proud Congressmen a few questions about that bill. Why are the legal hurdles to imposing the bill's vaunted death penalty so high and so numerous (the killing has to be &quot;intentional,&quot; juries have to consider whether the defendant was &quot;under duress,&quot; the judge can hire outside investigators and experts on the defendant's behalf, and so forth)? How come the $10,000 civil penalty on convicted users can be imposed only twice? Why is it that the federal benefits-denial provision doesn't apply if a person says he's an addict and goes into a rehab program? Why did the Congressmen vote in favor of dropping the &quot;exclusionary rule&quot; provision, which would have made it easier for the police to collect evidence? What's the idea of giving the federal government the authority to cut off some of a state's funding if it doesn't set up a loan fund to create group housing for drug-abusers?    Tomorrow is Election Day. Do you know what your Congressman has been doing? </TEXT></DOC>
