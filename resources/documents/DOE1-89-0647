Data transmitted for control,protection, and communication between this facility's Third Powerplantand 500-kv switchyard are essential for the safe and efficient operationof the Bureau's equipment and the integrity of the connected power systems.To accomplish the reliable, high speed transmission of such data overthe relatively long distance between these two locations having unequalground potential rise (GPR) a fiber optic communication system was installed,tested, and placed into service. The paper discusses the rationale forapplying fiber optic technology in this application with emphasis onthe related design considerations important in control and protectionof this large hydroelectric facility. Brief summaries of hardware usedand installation considerations are given. Fundamentals and principlesof fiber optic system design are not intended or covered. Discussionof factory and unique field testing, including electromagnetic interference(EMI) induced transient influence and timing tests, is included. Operatingexperience and projected future use are summarized.</TEXT></DOC>
