<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-18-0973 </DOCNO><TEXT>We describe a new method for large-scale computer simulation of the effectiveaction in lattice field theories. As a first application, the scalarphi{sup 4} model with spontaneous symmetry breaking is studied, and therenormalization of physical parameters is calculated from the effectiveaction. Mean-field scaling behavior with calculable logarithmic scalingcorrections at the trivial Gaussian fixed point (vanishing renormalizedcoupling) is supported by our results. Applications to the electroweaktheory are outlined and a bound on the Higgs-boson mass is estimated.</TEXT></DOC>
