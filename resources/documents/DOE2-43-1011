In cooling circuits of pressurized water reactors theresidual corrosion is still high enough to produce radioactive corrosionproducts to such a degree as to complicate operations. A further loweringof the corrosion rate demands a more effective inhibition of the transportof corrosion reactants through the film. A closer investigation of thetransport paths discussed so far showed that diffusion through water-filledpores dominated. It is postulated that the whole oxide layer forms bymeans of a combined mechanism of solution and deposition whereby poresare defined as interstices between the growing crystals. On the whole,an increase in the corrosion-protective value of the film is linked witha decrease in its porosity. This is attainable if, in the initial phaseof the film growth, the corrosive environment contains titanium or zirconiumcompounds originating hydrous oxides fit for deposition upon the materialsurface in subcoloidal dispersion. The resulting hindrance of the growthof oxide crystals leads to the formation of thin, apparently amorphousfilms having improved corrosion-protective properties.</TEXT></DOC>
