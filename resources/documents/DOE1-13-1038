It was tested whether and with which accuracythe radioimmunological determination of LH in the serum can contributeto the diagnosis of pituitary gonad diseases and whether in the caseof endocrine diseases the accompanying disturbances of the gonadotropinsecretion which primarily do not affect the hypothalamo - hypophyso -gonadal circuit are demonstrable. The study results for the diagnosisgroups primary and secondary hypogonadism of various genesis, gynacomastia,impotentia coeundi, primary and secondary ovarial insufficiency, hirsutismand adiposity were presented and discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
