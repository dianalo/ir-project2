Stocks managed to rebound from a midmorning sell-off, which traders linked to profit-taking following news of a 3.5% drop in July factory orders, but they proved unable to make any progress. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.20 to 2038.23 after surging 24 points Monday.    Broader market averages fared somewhat better, as Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 0.18 to 262.51 and the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.11 to 148.66. There were 741 issues advancing in price on the Big Board, while 644 declined.    New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 108.7 million shares -- better than Monday's total of 99.3 million but still the fourth lowest this year on the Big Board.    Philip Puccio, manager of institutional trading at Dillon, Read andamp; Co., said that even though volume remained light, institutions were more active in the market than they had been either Monday or last Friday, the slowest Big Board session of the year. &quot;I think that's healthy, because it shows that institutions are still willing to get involved,&quot; he said.    With the report on factory orders and the news of a 0.8% decline in the July index of leading indicators out of the way, traders said the market has already started to focus on the unemployment report for August, set for release Friday.    The consensus estimate of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report calls for the report to show a 5.4% jobless rate, unchanged from July, and an increase of 225,000 in nonfarm payrolls during August. In July, payrolls rose 283,000.    The Federal Reserve has targeted the jobless data as a key factor in determining monetary policy. Just after the July figures were released, the central bank raised its discount rate -- the fee charged on loans to financial institutions -- by half a percentage point. Concern that interest rates could be heading even higher remains widespread in the market.    Dillon Read's Mr. Puccio suggested that the market could attract renewed buying interest after the Labor Day weekend as long as the unemployment report is &quot;nothing really catastrophic.&quot;    Rumors circulated through Wall Street that Japan's Ministry of Finance had asked Japanese life insurance companies to curtail their dividend-capture trading in a bid to ease U.S. criticism of the practice. A Ministry of Finance official in New York declined to comment on the report.    Several traders and executives active in handling dividend-capture business, which involves buying large blocks of stock to get dividends and then quickly selling them, said the rumors appeared to have substance. &quot;The activity has been virtually eliminated from where I sit,&quot; said a trader for the U.S. arm of a Japanese securities firm. But others said the trading was continuing, though at a slower pace.    Insurance companies have employed the dividend capture strategy because of Japanese law requiring whole life policy holders to be paid from dividend income rather than capital gains. The practice has been criticized for inflating trading activity.    The sluggish trading activity at the moment may actually be working in the market's favor, according to Eugene E. Peroni Jr., director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott, Philadelphia.    Because volume is light, &quot;it only takes a small improvement in investors' perception to create a wide swing to the up side,&quot; he said. &quot;Activity will pick up a little bit more once investors become a little bit more confident that we've struck a trading range bottom, which I believe we have done.&quot;    The Dow Jones industrials bounced off the 2000 level last week, and Mr. Peroni said he expects the average to reach the vicinity of 2100 over the next five to seven sessions. He added that an easing of concern about the prospects for interest rates and inflation could come in September and allow the market to move higher.    On the other hand, Guy Courtney, a senior vice president at David A. Noyes andamp; Co., Chicago, called the ongoing lack of volume &quot;tremendously discouraging&quot; in terms of the outlook for any further gains in stocks.    &quot;There is nothing about this market, technically or fundamentally, that says we've hit bottom and that we're going to turn,&quot; he added. &quot;Any of these little rallies in here are sucker rallies.&quot;    Before the market can stage a sustainable rally, Mr. Courtney said, a sharp decline in stocks on heavy volume is to be expected. &quot;Give me that 500 million-share day and put us down 100 points {on the Dow Jones industrials}, and I'd be a raving lunatic bull,&quot; he said.    Automatic Data Processing fell 2 5/8 to 35 7/8 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading of 1.8 million shares. Drexel Burnham Lambert lowered its investment rating on the stock and reduced its estimates of the company's fiscal 1989 and 1990 earnings. An analyst at the firm cited expectations of further delays in the design and installation of broker quote systems at Merrill Lynch and Shearson Lehman Hutton, as well as a slowdown in the company's brokerage back office service business. Automatic Data said it is sticking to earlier projections for completion of work on the systems.    Gould soared 7 1/8 to 22 3/4 in composite trading on news that the company had agreed to be acquired by Nippon Mining of Japan for $23.25 a share. The Big Board halted trading in Gould just before the close as a result of the news.    J.C. Penney, which created a leveraged employee stock ownership plan in conjunction with an expanded stock repurchase program, rose 1 7/8 to 48 1/8. The plan borrowed $700 million to purchase a new issue of preferred stock from Penney, which will use proceeds from the sale to buy back up to 15 million common shares.    Middle South Utilities rose 3/8 to 13 5/8 on New York Stock Exchange composite volume of two million shares. The utility's chief financial officer, John L. Cowan, said the heavy trading may have been linked to speculation that it may soon resume the payment of a common stock dividend. Middle South, which last paid a dividend on its common in July 1985, has said that some kind of payout could be reinstated by yearend.    Digital Communications Associates dropped 2 5/8 to 27 3/4. Robinson-Humphrey lowered its investment rating on the stock and its estimate of the company's fiscal first-quarter earnings, citing lower-than-expected sales. The company confirmed that sales for both July and August were disappointing and said it now expects its sales for the quarter to be below the previous quarter's $63.3 million.    Primerica continued its slide in the wake of its agreement to be acquired by Commercial Credit Group for cash and stock valued at about $1.7 billion. The stock, which dropped 3/8 point Monday despite the market's rally, fell another 1/2 to 29.    Great Lakes Chemical fell 1 1/2 to 52 3/8 following the publication of a scientific study concluding that bromines could be doing as much damage to the Earth's protective ozone layer as the chlorofluorocarbons once used in spray cans. The company is one of the largest U.S. producers of chemicals containing bromine. Ethyl, another major manufacturer of such chemicals, fell 1/8 to 21 3/8.    The American Stock Exchange index slipped 0.14 to 294.91. Amex volume totaled 9,140,000 shares, up from 7,780,000 Monday. There were 252 issues advancing, 307 declining and 261 unchanged.    American Technical Ceramics plunged 1 1/2 to 3 after the termination of its agreement in principle to be acquired by AVX for $5.25 a share. The companies gave no details. AVX remained unchanged at 18 1/4 in Big Board trading. </TEXT></DOC>
