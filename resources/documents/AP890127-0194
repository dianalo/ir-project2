But the official, Antonio dos Santos Franca, Angola's deputydefense minister, said ``elements'' of the guerrilla group hadcontact with the government about its policy of clemency andnational reconciliation, Portuguese Radio Commercial reported.   The Angolan government repeatedly has denied contacts withofficials the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.UNITA has fought the government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santossince losing a civil war after Angola won independence from Portugalin 1975.   Alcides Sakala, a guerrilla spokesman in Lisbon, also said Angolaand UNITA had no formal contacts.   ``We have to establish official contacts to solve the internalproblem (in Angola), and the sooner the better,'' he said in atelephone interview with The Associated Press.   News reports here have suggested that informal talks between thegovernment and the rebels followed the U.S.-brokered negotiationsthat led Angola, Cuba and South Africa to sign peace accords on Dec.22.   Cuba agreed to withdraw its troops backing the Angolangovernment, and South Africa, which supplies arms to the Angolanrebels, agreed to relinquish control of neighboring Namibia.   The Portuguese news agency Lusa had reported that dos SantosFranca said in Lisbon on Thursday that ``there have to be contacts,it's not a conversation between two ghosts.''   ``We are trying to initiate an immediate dialogue, we are tryingto start this whole process,'' Lusa quoted dos Santos Franca assaying Thursday, but it added the deputy minister gave no details.   The government offers clemency to rebels who renounce theguerrilla group, but Angolan government officials have yet to meetwith rebel leader Jonas Savimbi.   Continued clashes between the Angolan government and the rebelshave claimed almost 200 lives since mid-January, statements releasedFriday said.

A statement issued by the rebels claimed they killed 114government soldiers in fighting in the provinces of Huambo,Benguela, South Kuanza and Uige.
