Congress enacted legislation to improve the Endangered SpeciesAct, switch the nation's vehicles to alternative fuels and launchcampaigns against indoor pollution from radon gas and to controlincreasing amounts of improperly discarded medical waste.   But gathering dust along with the clean air bill were proposalsto give the Environmental Protection Agency more clout overhazardous waste generated by other federal agencies and to setground rules for disposing of ash from growing numbers of municipalincinerators.   Also left undone was one of the Reagan administration's morecontroversial land-use proposals to the 100th Congress, a plan toallow petroleum development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.   Environmentally, the 100th Congress began in January 1987 with afiscal battle against the White House over the future of the CleanWater Act, the law credited with improving the quality of many ofAmerica's waterways.   A 1986 bill to give local governments $18 billion through 1994to build waste water and sewage treatment facilities had beenpocket-vetoed as too costly by President Reagan after the 99thCongress adjourned.   By huge majorities in both chambers, the 100th quickly sent thesame bill to the president, who was trying to cut the funding to$12 billion and vetoed the package a second time.   Republicans deserted the White House in droves as the Housevoted 401-26 and the Senate 86-14 to override the second veto.There was a major element of pork-barrel in the outcome: everystate and virtually every district was in line for a share of themoney.   While this fight occurred on the front lines, the struggle overthe clean air bill took place in the trenches, with neither theHouse nor Senate able to bring a proposal to the floor for debate.   Led by Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, the Environment Committeedrafted an ambitious package to attack urban smog, acid rain andairborne toxic chemicals. The administration opposed major portionsof it, and the bill's depth and breadth brought it a wide varietyof industry foes.   Mitchell spent much of 1988 trying to unite diverse economic andregional interests but abandoned efforts in early October, sayingthere was a lack of will to compromise among the environmental andindustry lobbies.   On the House side, a clean air bill never came up for a vote inthe Energy and Commerce Committee despite efforts by middle-groundmembers to bring together environmentalist Henry Waxman, D-Calif.,and chairman John Dingell, D-Mich., who opposed Waxman's plan toclean up auto emissions.   While deadlocked on low-level air pollution, committees on bothsides of the Capitol were raising their sights with a series ofhearings on global warming, the greenhouse effect that scientistssay threatens the planet with climate changes and rising sea levels.   Legislation was introduced in both chambers to begin clampingdown on the greenhouse gases that are trapping the sun's heat inthe atmosphere. More hearings are planned for the 101st Congress,which will be looking to the new president to exercise leadershipagainst a global environmental threat.   On another global issue, the Senate this year ratified theinternational agreement to reduce emissions of chlorofluorocarbons,the chemicals said to be destroying the Earth's vital ozone layer.   The 1987 agreement was largely the result of a worldwidediplomatic effort by the Reagan administration, which for nearlyeight years has fought Congress on many proposals to improve thedomestic environment.   One exception was the joint work by the administration andCongress on the recently passed bill to combat radon, the naturallyoccurring gas that seeps into buildings and is described as secondonly to cigarette smoking as a cause of lung cancer.   The bill sets a long-term goal of having indoor air as free ofradon concentrations as the air outdoors. It would authorize $30million to help states set up radon control programs, require EPAto survey schools for radon and mandate standards for radonabatement contractors.   One of the potentially far-reaching acts of the 100th Congresswas a plan to switch cars, trucks and buses away from gasoline toalternative fuels made from coal, natural gas and grain.   The legislation attempts to wean the nation away from petroleumimports by giving automakers incentives to produce the vehiclesthat are necessary to spur production of alternatives to gasoline.   Responding to increasing reports of medical waste washing up onshorelines, Congress recently passed legislation to require EPA toset up controls to track this sometimes dangerous trash.   The initial program would be geared to Connecticut, New Jerseyand the eight states bordering the Great Lakes. It could, however,become national in scope because any other state could ask to beincluded.</TEXT></DOC>
