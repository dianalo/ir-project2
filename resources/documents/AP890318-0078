(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With Discovery safely back on Earth,NASA will move forward on its ambitious launch schedule by takingAtlantis to the launch pad Wednesday for an April 28 liftoff withthe first space shuttle planetary payload.   Magellan, a 7,600-pound spacecraft that resembles a giant insect,will be dispatched by Atlantis' crew for a 466-day outward journeyto Venus. The probe is to orbit the cloud-shrouded planet and mapits surface with high-resolution radar.   Discovery's successful launch last Monday with a communicationssatellite was the first of seven shuttle flights planned this yearas the space agency continues its recovery from the 1986 Challengerexplosion, working toward a flight rate of 12 a year by 1992.   Shuttle boss Richard Truly said after Discovery's return fromspace on Saturday that ``our goal is to fly again and again,'' withsafety always a prime consideration.   He said Discovery returned in better condition than any othershuttle and that bodes well for maintaining a vigorous launchschedule.   ``It shows again what a marvelous and capable vehicle this is,''Truly said.   It also demonstrates, he said, that NASA has the capability offlying a busy and safe launch rate.   One stumbling block in the shuttle schedule may be the extensivemodifications being made to Columbia, the first shuttle in thefleet, Truly said. That shuttle's July 1 target launch date with aclassified military payload already has slipped about two weeks.   Any additional delay could push back another military shuttleflight planned in August, and that could begin impacting thehigh-priority October launch of Atlantis with the Galileo probe toJupiter.   ``We want very much to launch Columbia in July,'' Truly said.``If not, we'll delay it to meet the Galileo window.''   Magellan and Galileo are high-priority missions because there isonly a month or so every two years when their planetary targets arein the proper alignment for a launch.   The space agency also is conscious that no American spacecrafthas been launched toward the planets since 1978.   Here's the present launch schedule for this year:   April 28 _ Atlantis, with the Magellan-Venus spacecraft.   Mid-July _ Columbia, with a Defense Department payload.   Mid-August _ Discovery with a Defense Department payload.   Oct. 12 _ Atlantis, with the Galileo-Jupiter spacecraft.   Nov. 13 _ Columbia, whose crew is to deploy a communicationssatellite and retrieve for return to Earth a scientific satelliteorbiting since 1984.   Dec. 11 _ Discovery, with the Hubble Space Telescope.   Ten flights are scheduled in 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
