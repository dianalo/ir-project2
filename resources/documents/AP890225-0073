The number of Central Americans bothering to apply for asylum hasplummeted since last week when the U.S. Immigration andNaturalization Service toughened its stance on political asylumapplicants. The INS reported it processed 233 asylum applicationsTuesday, the first day of the get-tough procedure, and only 19 wereprocessed Friday; over that period, three were granted asylum.   Border Patrol officials say the Central Americans are hidingwherever they can until they believe they can cross illegally intothe United States.   ``We think they're just lying low, maybe at hotels in Matamoros,with alien-smugglers or with sympathizers,'' said Silvestre Reyes,chief of the Border Patrol's McAllen sector.   At a Catholic Church-run shelter named Casa Juan Diego, dozens ofCentral Americans talked about why they fled their homelands andabout their long, difficult journeys during which they were robbedand were forced to beg for rides and food.   They also asked about the new INS rules, under which asylumpetitions can be denied in one day and the applicants then jailedpending deportation, and how difficult it would be to reachdestinations like Los Angeles, Miami or New York.   ``I don't know what we're going to do, but we'll find a way tocross, no matter what the cost is,'' said 21-year-old NicaraguanMarta Salcedo, who arrived Monday with five other Nicaraguans.   ``We don't want to go back to our own country. We'll be killedbecause we are viewed as counter-revolutionaries,'' she said.``We'll get to the other side somehow.''   But U.S. Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley saygetting past them is going to be tough. More than 125 agents havebeen sent to the district, bringing the total to 500. And they'reall working 12-hour shifts.   Ms. Salcedo, whose father was an officer in the Anastasio Somozaregime that was overthrown by the leftist Sandinistas, fled with herfamily to Guatemala in September 1987 and began her journey to theUnited States earlier this month.   Fellow Nicaraguan Marina Espinoza and her three children saidthey were robbed by police near Mexico City. They want to go to LosAngeles to see the children's father, Vicente Espinoza, who filedfor asylum after entering the country more than a year ago.   ``I just want to see my father and tell him that I love him verymuch,'' said 6-year-old Eric Espinoza.   Casa Juan Diego is just a concrete shell with a sparselyfurnished kitchen and sleeping quarters where mattresses andblankets are placed on top of cinder blocks. Residents have amaximum six-night stay and are provided one meal daily.   The shelter, administered by the Rev. Oscar Lozano of the nearbyOur Lady of Lourdes Church, has helped more than 1,000 CentralAmericans since it opened in the fall of 1987. It can house up to130 people, but mostly sleeps 30 to 40 each night.   Mexican officials know about the shelter but do not aggressivelyseek out the Central Americans, said a Mexican immigration officialworking at the church who asked that his name not be used.   ``The government is not supposed to be helping these people, butI have been working with the church for a long time and it's justthe Christian thing to do,'' the official said.   Alien smugglers know about the facility too and try to persuadethe aliens to pay them for help in getting across the Rio Grande.   ``They know the opportunity to make fast money is always there,''Lozano has told reporters.   Nearly all the 40 residents at the shelter Friday said they wereconfused about the new U.S. immigration policy.   ``We came real far and for them to close the door on us is notfair,'' said Nelson Antonio Espinoza-Gonzalez, 18, of Nicaragua.   ``Nicaragua is getting worse, politically, economically andideologically. It's all orders,'' said Alfonso Martinez, 29, aformer electronic engineer. ``My life would be in danger inNicaragua.''   He said he had traveled too far to be deported.   ``We will just wait here, maybe until the (U.S) law is changed oruntil the American immigration gets tired of waiting for us,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
