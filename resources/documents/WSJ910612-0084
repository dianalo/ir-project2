While the Nasdaq index had gained nearly three pointsearly in the session, traders said uncertainties about thestrength of the U.S. economy and the direction of interestrates sapped the market's strength in the afternoon, leavingit mixed at the close.</LP><TEXT>   The Nasdaq Composite finished with a gain of 0.77, or0.16%, to 496.62. The index had posted daily losses for eachof the prior four sessions. Declining issues, however, edgedout advancers, 979 to 951.

TheNew York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 1.09, or0.52%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 10.51, or0.35%.   Hedi Reynolds, head of OTC trading at Morgan Keegan andamp; Co.,said she didn't see leadership among any particular industrysegment yesterday. &quot;With our stocks, (gains) were more justin selective stocks than across the board,&quot; she said.   Several clients, she added, said that they were awaitingfurther news on the economy before making any significantmove in the Nasdaq market.   Nelson Gold, senior vice president of OTC trading atInterstate-Johnson Lane Corp., said investors &quot;would like tohave a real reason to invest. The next push is going to comewhen they figure out if interest rates are going to comedown, and if the recession is really over.&quot;   Mr. Gold said OTC trading may remain somewhat subduedahead of the Labor Department's report tomorrow on producerprices and its reading Friday on consumer prices.   Stocks will benefit if bond investors perceive the numbersas noninflationary and bid long-term interest rates lower,Mr. Gold said. &quot;With long-term rates where they are now, it'spretty stiff competition for&quot; stocks, he said.
