We can learn a lot from those who lead in theirability to speed new products to the market withoutsacrificing product quality or marketability. My own top-10list would be:   Honda, Compaq, Motorola, Sony, Canon, Boeing, Merckpharmaceuticals, Microsoft, Intel microprocessors and Toyota.There are others I could have chosen. 3M comes to mind. Sodoes Ford, lately. Nonetheless, I believe my picks are thebest.</LP><TEXT>   The following management themes are common to most, if notall of these suppliers:   -- They focus on one or only a few businesses. They arenot diversified conglomerates. The senior management of thecompany is able to direct its attention to the business athand. Typically more than 80% of the sales at these companiescome from one or two highly related businesses. Merck is thesecond most focused major pharmaceutical company in the worldwith 84% of its sales coming from pharmaceutical products.Canon's optical based products account for 88% of sales.Boeing gets 89% of its sales from aircraft. Automobilesaccount for 84% of Toyota's sales.   Intel and Honda produce many different products, but theyboth have an underlying technology that drives them. All ofHonda's sales come from engine-based products (e.g. autos,motorcycles, lawn mowers). All of Intel's sales come from thedesign, development, manufacture and sale of microcomputercomponents and related products (at various levels ofintegration).   Compaq focuses almost solely on the personal computermarket, and more specifically, on the business PC market.Michael Swavely, president of Compaq's North AmericanDivision commented: &quot;We don't spend a lot of time worryingabout the home market or the educational market or some ofthe industrial markets. We focus our resources on developingnew products to meet the needs of the business PC user.&quot;   -- They are global. Two points are worth making here.First, their capability is so strong that they are able tocompete globally. Second, many actively pursue internationalmarkets specifically where the competition is stiff to ensurethat they remain world class by being tested against thebest.   In fact, world-class developers usually are among the topten competitors in each of the major global markets -- U.S.,Japan and Europe. Boeing holds a bigger share than Airbus orMcDonnell Douglas in each of the three markets. Merck isfirst in the U.S., sixth in Europe and ninth in Japan. Toyotais first in Japan, fifth in the U.S. and would be higher thanits twelfth position in Europe were it not for protectionistpolicies. The same holds true for Honda which is third inJapan and fourth in the U.S. Compaq is the second supplier ofbusiness PCs in the U.S. and Canada, and second in Europetoo.   Motorola spares no effort to break into tough markets.Motorola pressured the Japanese to open up itstelecommunication market and has become a significant playerin the cellular market. In 1988, Canon initiated a five-yearGlobal Corporation Plan intended to increase productionworld-wide by relocating some of its manufacturingcapabilities, and extending Randamp;D outside of Japan. Merck isthe most aggressive of all large pharmaceutical companies inobtaining approvals for and marketing its new drugs in thetop world markets. Between 1982 and 1988 Merck launched 10new drugs in 47% of the top 12 markets world-wide against anindustry median of 33%.   Typically world-class developers have 35% to 70% of theirsales outside their home market. Merck led all U.S. drugcompanies in 1988 with 50% of its sales outside the U.S.Honda had 63% of its sales outside Japan, while both Canonand Sony had 69%. Motorola had 36% outside of the U.S. andIntel had 43%. In 1989, international sales accounted for 45%of Compaq's revenue, 46% of 3M's and 55% of Microsoft's.Perhaps reflecting the increasing importance of globalmarkets, Ford's new chief executive, Red Poling, has sevenyears of experience with Ford of Europe.   -- Senior management is actively involved in defining andimproving the product development process. At Merck there arenumerous senior management committees that meet on a monthlybasis to manage the development process and the portfolio ofcandidates in the pipeline. At Microsoft, Bill Gates keeps incontact with its engineers by dispatching memos over thecompany's electronic mail network, sometimes as many as 30 ina day. Many CEOs were themselves involved in the productdevelopment process. Roy Vagelos of Merck is a physician anda biochemist. He became research chief in 1976. Honda has hada tradition of engineering executives. All four presidents inHonda's history have been engineers and had previously ledthe Randamp;D organization.   -- They have the ability to recruit and retain the toppeople in their fields. One of Merck managers' more importantresponsibilities is to recruit stars. Consequently, Merckboasts that its people are higher quality than found at someof the best academic institutions. In order to retain thetalent, Merck is known to skip several rungs on the ladderwhen promoting its top people. Microsoft, too, is known forhiring the best and brightest possible.   -- They understand that speed to market reinforces productquality, rather than threatening it. If Honda and GM are bothdesigning an auto for the 1992 market, and it takes Honda twoyears to design the model while GM takes five, Honda has anumber of advantages. It can design in 1990 availabletechnology, whereas GM must design in 1987 technology. Hondaneed only forecast customer need two years into the future,whereas GM requires a five-year time horizon, and is muchmore likely to miss. Finally, Honda's development teams gaindevelopment experience 2.5 times more quickly than GM's.   World-class product development requires senior managementleadership, involvement and commitment. It requires adisciplined new-product development process recognized andunderstood by all who &quot;touch&quot; it in the organization. It alsorequires aggressive goals to ensure continuous improvement.   ---   Mr. Reiner, a vice president of Boston Consulting Group,specializes in new product development programs.</TEXT></DOC>
