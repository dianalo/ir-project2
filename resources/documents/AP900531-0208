COLEMAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Most people still choose their doctors by relyingmainly on advice from friends or family rather than feeconsiderations, despite growing worry over medical costs, a pollhas found.   But one watcher of the health-care market suggested the figuresmask the large number of patients who automatically put feeconsiderations first by belonging to managed health-care plans thatlimit physician choices.   And the head of a health-consumer group said more people mightmake decisions based on fees if fee information were easier to get.   A Gallup poll of 1,500 randomly selected U.S. adults found thatthe factor they most often cited as their main reason for choosinga doctor was the recommendation of friends or family. That reasonwas offered by 19 percent.   Referrals by professionals were close behind at 17 percent,followed by specific medical reasons at 13 percent and convenienceat 9 percent, according to the survey, commissioned by the AmericanMedical Association.   Only 1 percent of those surveyed cited fees as the main factorin their most recent selection of a physician, said an article inthe May 25 issue of the AMA's weekly American Medical News.   But 20 percent of respondents said cost was at least part of thepicture when they chose a doctor. That compares with 60 percent whosaid they believe cost is the main problem facing U.S. health careand medicine today.   ``The results show that although the public is concerned withthe big-picture concept of medical costs, patients care far moreabout how a physician treated their neighbor or their cousin thanwhich physician has the cheapest fees,'' said Dr. James S. Todd,acting AMA executive vice president.   But other specialists offered different interpretations,including Roger Holstein, president of Consumer Health ServicesInc., which operates a physician-referral service called Prologuein eight cities.   He said 32 percent of people choosing physicians already belongto cost-saving managed-care plans, such as health maintenanceorganizations or preferred provider organizations, that restricttheir choice of physicians, so ``the process of choosing a doctorhas much more to do with convenience.''   An additional 27 percent of people looking for doctors arelimited to physicians who can offer payment plans or will accepttheir insurance, Holstein said from Boulder, Colo.   ``There is evidence that 59 percent are choosing a doctorlargely on the basis of payment plans,'' said Holstein, quotingfigures from a study his company did this year.   Arthur Levin, director of the Center for Medical Consumers, anon-profit medical information service with 15,000 subscribers,said he believes few doctors will release fee schedules over thetelephone.   ``There's no way to compare unless you go around to 10 doctorsand make appointments'' and ask for prices of varying servicesduring the course of an examination, he said from New York.   ``That's kind of an inefficient and expensive way to find outwhat the price is,'' he said.   The Gallup poll, conducted in January and February, found thatconcern about doctors fees is growing. The proportion ofrespondents who agreed to the statement ``doctors fees are usuallyreasonable'' fell from 33 percent in 1988 to 25 percent in 1990,said the poll, which had an error margin of 2.5 percentage points.</TEXT><NOTE>End advance for June 4</NOTE></DOC>
