McGinnis is scribbling on the blackboard, explaining how Pauli's exclusion principle affects the configuration of electrons.    Marcia Eley, a 20-year-old junior from Jackson, in her usual place in the second row, follows the lesson intently. She knows that if she keeps her grades up, she'll enter Brown University Medical School, in Providence, R.I., in fall of 1988.    Because of her academic record and an aptitude for science, Miss Eley was chosen last year for a unique early enrollment program run by the Ivy League university and Tougaloo. The aim of the program, which began in 1977, is to create more black doctors. Since then, Brown has tapped one or two Tougaloo sophomores each year.    The two schools' special relationship dates to the 1960s, when Brown faculty and administrators came to Mississippi for civil-rights marches and became enamored with the 700-student Tougaloo campus. The schools soon began a student and faculty exchange, extending it to the Brown medical school after it revived its full program in 1975.    Brown and Tougaloo officials say the program finds and encourages talented black students who are likely to come from environments where there are few blacks in medicine. For example, Melvin Burton, a Tougaloo and Brown alumnus who is currently chief resident at Miriam Hospital in Providence, recalls that there weren't any black doctors in Shaw, the Mississippi delta hamlet where he grew up. &quot;I came to Tougaloo with no desire to enter medicine,&quot; says Dr. Burton, the youngest of 13 children. &quot;I intended to become a math teacher.&quot;    Currently, the U.S. has 54 black doctors per 100,000 blacks, compared with 218 doctors per 100,000 for the population in general. Though the number of blacks in medical school jumped between 1968 and 1975 -- to 6.2% of medical students in the U.S. from just 2.2% -- the percentage declined to 5.8% for the 1985-86 academic year.    Although Brown-Tougaloo is so far the only such one-to-one medical-school early identification plan, the principle has been adopted elsewhere.    Boston University Medical School in the early 1980s began making early commitments to students at a group of historically black colleges, among them Tougaloo, as well as Pembroke State University, a predominantly American Indian school in North Carolina.    Medical schools have become increasingly receptive to Tougaloo students in recent years because of the liberal-arts college's own initiatives. Since 1973, Tougaloo has used a federal grant to bring 50 or so high school juniors and seniors for summer courses in advanced math and science. As a result, &quot;we've gained a reputation as a science school,&quot; says Prof. McGinnis, head of the natural-science division.    About a dozen Tougaloo students have entered Brown under the early identification program. About half have completed medical school and are now in residency programs. Only one has been dismissed because of academic failure.    Some whom Brown accepted chose other medical schools because of Brown's steep tuition, currently close to $15,000 a year. Tougaloo students at Brown don't get special financial help. The only outside support for the program comes from the Atlanta-based Southern Education Foundation Inc., which over the past six years has granted Brown about $33,000 for administrative expenses.    Making the transition from Tougaloo to Brown can be rough. &quot;More than 90% of our students are from Mississippi,&quot; says Mr. McGinnis. &quot;They may have been to Chicago to visit family, but that's about it.&quot; Many hail from small Mississippi towns where there is little integration.    Coming to Brown was &quot;cultural shock,&quot; says Glenda Coleman, a 24-year-old farmer's daughter from the all-black Mississippi delta town of Mound Bayou. She is in her fourth year at Brown medical school. &quot;At Tougaloo, you didn't have to worry about being accepted,&quot; she says.    Brown tries to ease the transition by bringing Tougaloo students to Rhode Island for a summer of research work with faculty members. Tougaloo students are also encouraged to take the summer courses Brown offers all students entering medical school.    Many of the students say they plan to return to Mississippi as physicians. &quot;I really like where I come from,&quot; says Emma Simmons, a 21-year old native of the small town of Laurel, who is headed for Brown this fall. &quot;I would love to practice medicine there.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
