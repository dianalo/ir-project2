The computer, using the same information quickly assembledby the doctors such as physical symptoms, health history, andelectrocardiogram results, correctly identified 35 of 36, or97%, of the heart attacks. The emergency room doctorsinstantly identified only 28, or 78%, of the heart attacks.Blood tests of enzyme levels, which take a few hours toprocess, were used as a final assessment.</LP><TEXT>   The experiment, run by William G. Baxt at the Universityof California, San Diego Medical Center, was the first inwhich an artificial intelligence program matched wits soeffectively against physicians. Dr. Baxt, in a report in thismonth's Annals of Internal Medicine, suggested that emergencyroom doctors under time pressure to make an instant diagnosismay someday supplement their decisions with a hand-heldcalculator to punch in symptoms and other data into apersonal computer containing the program.   An editorial accompanying Dr. Baxt's report called thecomputer's accuracy &quot;impressive,&quot; and predicted it willencourage other investigators to try similar computer brainsin aiding a wide range of doctors' diagnoses and treatmentdecisions.   &quot;The study by Baxt is an early contribution in what weexpect will be a series of applications of neural networks inclinical practice,&quot; wrote Michael R.J. Guerriere and Allan S.Detsky, two Toronto physicians, in the medical journal'seditorial.   The neural network, according to Dr. Baxt, is a kind ofartificial intelligence system that allows the programmer to&quot;train&quot; the computer to get better at making a particulardiagnosis. Dr. Baxt trained his program by feeding itsymptoms and other quickly assembled data from 356 emergencyroom patients suspected of having a heart attack, and thenalso telling the computer which of the patients actually hadan attack.   Mathematical weights were assigned to the importance ofthe data assembled, but the computer also was able to teachitself which collection of weighted information most oftensuggested a heart attack. The medical journal's editorialwriters said the neural network learns much like an infantwho is taught to distinguish between a cat and a dog by beingpresented with many examples of each along with the correctidentification.   Drs. Guerriere and Detsky said that while many doctors maybe reluctant to trust a &quot;black box,&quot; doctors often rely onintuitive diagnosis made by experts whose &quot;thought processescannot be explicitly passed on to others.&quot;   Dr. Baxt's program was especially adept at picking outattacks when important information, such as past healthhistory, was missing, as is often the case in an emergencyroom situation. Moreover, the computer misdiagnosed the truehealth problems of only 11 patients who didn't have heartattacks, for a 96% accuracy rating, while the doctors' ratingwas somewhat lower at 85%.   Dr. Baxt said he believed the machine still must undergo amore rigorous testing of many more patients at numerousmedical centers.</TEXT></DOC>
