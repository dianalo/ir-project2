A lawmaker with a rating of 100 percent is one who voted inaccordance with the position of the conservative group in allinstances. In Massachusetts the average score was just 3.69. InWyoming, it was 97.3.   Based on its selection of 22 key votes in the two chambers, someof which the group gave double weight, the ACU said both the Houseand Senate voted more conservatively in 1988 than in 1987. Theaverage House rating went from 37 percent to 44 percent, while theSenate average went from 40 percent to 43 percent.   In both chambers, however, the move to the right was made easierby a lack of confrontation over tough budget issues last year, dueto the 1987 budget summit, the group said.   Last month, the Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal group,released a similar survey and declared that the Congress had becomemore liberal.   The differences occur because the two groups base their surveyson different vote lists. However, the surveys do highlight theideological differences between the parties.   The ACU said four senators and 38 House members, all Republicans,scored 100 percent. The ADA last month gave two senators and twodozen House members, all Democrats, 100 percent ratings.   The conservative group in its rating gave double weight to voteson three issues: aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, the overrideof President Reagan's veto of the Grove City civil rights extensionbill, and a vote on shifting $100 million away from the Star Warsmissile defense system.</TEXT></DOC>
