Aid Effort</HEAD><BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sudan's new military rulers and rebelsfighting in the south have pledged to cooperate with U.N. efforts tosave 100,000 Sudanese threatened by famine and disease, theoperation's director says.   James P. Grant, the U.N. secretary-general's specialrepresentative for Operation Lifeline Sudan, spoke Tuesday at afund-raising conference where almost $10 million was raised towardthe $200-million relief effort.   The operation is the first example of both sides involved in acivil war providing safe passage so food and medicines can reach allparts of the country, said Grant.   Until this year, efforts in Sudan were hampered by the governmentor guerrillas refusing to allow supplies into areas controlled bythe other side.   However, Operation Lifeline needs another $40 million to extendits work through November and guarantee food is distributed, Granttold reporters.   With that amount, Grant said, ``We are confident that last year'sdisaster can be avoided. Operation Lifeline Sudan is on a successfultrack.''   The United Nations estimates 250,000 Sudanese died last year fromstarvation due to flood, drought, and war-induced famine.   Grant's project sought to get 120,000 tons of food into villagesbefore the monsoon isolates peasants. Over 85,000 tons has beendelivered.   Monsoons that make roads and airstrips impassable have hit fullforce, but Grant said he hopes relief workers have time to deliverthe rest of the supplies by Nile River barge, light planes andtrucks.   Sudan's entire fleet of over 50 barges has been trapped in thebesieged government garrison in southern Malakal since early thisyear.   Frightened soldiers were holding the tugboats and barges in casethey needed to escape from the rebels, said Grant. The garrison nowhas agreed to let Operation Lifeline have 18 barges and threetugboats, he said. A trial delivery of supplies to Malakal would beattempted today, said Grant.   Relief officials had feared the June 30 coup would complicatetheir campaign. But Grant said he met the coup leader, Lt. Gen. OmarHassan Ahmed el-Bashir, and ``he took great pains to reaffirm thesupport of the new government to continuing Operation LifelineSudan.''   El-Bashir has said one of the reasons he ousted Prime MinisterSadek el-Mahdi's civilian government is because it failed to stopthe war.   A spokesman for the new government said today that Ethiopia'sPresident Mengistu Haile Mariam has agreed to mediate peace talkswith the rebels.   Lt. Col. Mohammed el-Amin Khalifa, a member of Sudan's rulingcouncil, said Mengistu agreed after Khalifa carried a formal requestfrom el-Bashir.   Mengistu's government backs the Sudanese People's LiberationArmy, which is fighting for more autonomy. The government controlsonly the garrison towns in southern provinces of Sudan, the largestAfrican country that covers an area one-third the size of thecontinental United States.   Most southerners are Christians or animists who revolted againstattempts by the Moslem-dominated government to impose Islamic law onthe entire nation.</TEXT></DOC>
