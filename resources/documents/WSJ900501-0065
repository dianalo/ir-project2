The fine is part of the exchange's crackdown on allegedintermarket trading abuses. Exchange critics have oftenclaimed that traders illicitly profit from buying or sellingstock-index options or futures, based on advance knowledge oflarge stock trades their firms or customers intend to make.Such a practice is known as intermarket front-running oforders.</LP><TEXT>   The Susquehanna fine is among the largest levied against aCBOE member firm in recent years. Responding to congressionalconcern about lax market regulation, the stock and optionsexchanges have stepped up their efforts to ferret outintermarket trading abuses in recent months.   Susquehanna submitted to the exchange findings andcensures without admitting or denying the allegations. Butthe Philadelphia-based firm made its &quot;compliance andsupervisory structure more stringent&quot; following the eventscited by the CBOE, said Steve Bloom, a Susquehanna managingdirector.   Susquehanna, known for its sophisticated computer-driventrading strategies, has long been a source of suspicion andenvy on Wall Street. Founded by some former collegeclassmates about four years ago, the tiny firm consistentlyranks among the top 10 program traders in the New York StockExchange's monthly reports. The firm trades only for its ownaccount.   A stock-index option is the right to buy (call) or sell(put) the underlying value of a stock index, such as theStandard andamp; Poor's 100-stock index, at a specified pricewithin a certain time period. Stock index options are settledin cash, rather than by the delivery of the stocks on whichthe index is based. The CBOE is the nation's largest optionsexchange. Stock-index trading accounts for the majority ofits trading volume.   The CBOE said that on Sept. 16, 1988, a Susquehanna traderbought 935 stock-index options on the CBOE, while the firmhad already entered orders to buy more than 15 million sharesof stock as part of a program trade tied to the expirationthat afternoon of the CBOE options, which are based on theStandard andamp; Poor's 100-stock index. The orders to buy the 15million shares apparently gave Susquehanna a nearly risk-freeprofit on the 935 call options.   The CBOE said that the trader wasn't aware of the programtrade, but should have been.   Program trades involve the nearly simultaneous purchase orsale of stock and stock-index options or futures to profitfrom momentary price differences between these markets.   The CBOE fined Susquehanna $75,000 for the Sept. 16, 1988,trade, which it said violated exchange rules, and finedSusquehanna an additional $20,000 for the &quot;potential gain&quot;stemming from the trade. The firm was fined another $5,000for a trade made by a Susquehanna trader that same day, whichit said also violated exchange rules.   Susquehanna apparently profited on the 935 stock-indexoptions contracts when the firm's program trade involving thepurchase of more than 15 million shares of stock boostedstock and stock index option prices in the final minutes oftrading that Friday.   For trades that involved only a single market, Susquehannawas fined $70,000 for stock-index options trades madeDecember 13, 1988. The CBOE said that two Susquehanna tradersseparately bought and sold the same number of the samestock-index options for firm accounts &quot;in a matter whichreduced or eliminated the risk otherwise inherent&quot; in makingwhat are known as &quot;spread&quot; trades between different series ofoptions contracts.   The traders also failed to report the transaction timesfor some of these trades, the CBOE said.</TEXT></DOC>
