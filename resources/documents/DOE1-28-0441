They enable information to be gainedfor situations that would be hard to achieve experimentally and alsoensure that a wide range of problems can be studied without the needfor extensive experimental facilities. Useful results can be obtainedusing simple models, but the understanding of tool behavior in a complexsituation requires a more accurate description of the geometry and hencethe more general approach of Monte Carlo modeling. One of the primarytools employed in formation evaluation is the gamma-gamma density tool.A wide variety of probe designs are available from a number of companiesbut all include the use of a highly collimated source (typically {sup137}Cs) and a pair of detectors. The operation of a density sonde dependscritically on the location of shielding and the design of collimators;hence, a computer-based study requires detailed knowledge of the toolconstruction. This paper presents the results of a Monte Carlo modelingstudy aimed at obtaining a better understanding of the factors that influencedensity sondes.</TEXT></DOC>
