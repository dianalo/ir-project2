The following issues were addressed: (1) why does a mixedammonium/hydronium composition form when sodium beta alumina undergoesion exchange in ammonium nitrate and what determines the relative proportionsof ammonium and hydronium ions in the structure; (2) what is the thermalstability of the compound; and (3) what is the conductivity of ammonium/hydroniumbeta alumina and how is it influenced by composition. Data demonstratethat composition, thermal stability, and ionic conductivity in ammonium/hydroniumbeta alumina are closely related. Proportions of ammonium and hydroniumare variable and depend on the duration of the ion-exchange process.Eventually, however, a steady-state composition is achieved. This compositioncorresponds to a particular and rather elegant ordered arrangement ofammonium ions, hydronium ions, and vacancies in the structure. In additionand in contrast to previous work, we found that water and ammonia evolvefrom ammonium/hydronium beta alumina in discrete steps below 350{degree}C.Water is lost from the structure between 150 to 250{degree}C with anenthalpy of 10 kcal/mole. The loss of ammonia occurs at 250 to 300{degree}Cwith an enthalpy of 19 kcal/mole. Below 300{degree}C, the thermal decompositionof ammonium/hydronium beta alumina is reversible. The conductivity ofsingle crystals of ammonium/hydronium beta alumina (steady-state composition)obeys an Arrhenius relationship below 200{degree}C with an activationenergy of 0.26 eV ({sigma} = 10{sup {minus}3}({Omega}-cm){sup {minus}1}at 25{degree}C). Thermal annealing at 280{degree}C causes the conductivityto fall into the range observed for samples of hydronium beta alumina.14 refs., 10 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
