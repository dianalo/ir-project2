Ross, director of agency liaison officer pgorams at the GeneralServices Administration's Information Resources Management Service, agreed.andM;&quot;Contracting officers who traditionally have been buying screwdrivers andtrucks arent't equipped to buy complex major systems,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;You can'tbe buying screw-drivers one day and computers the next day -- it just doesn'twork.&quot;andM;Ross said the government is taking a step in the right direction by puttingtogether procurements teams for large contracts.andP;  Recent large buys using thenew approach have included GSA's FTS 2000 and the AFCAC 251 multiusercomputer procurement.andM;A team approach gives everyone involved -- technical, managerial andcontracting personnel -- an education into the complexities of each other'swork.andP;  That way, &quot;contracting officers will get a technical education, evenif it is by osmosis,&quot; Ross said.andM;The lack of specific guidelines for selecting contractors largely ontechnical value just compounds the problem, Kiviat said.andM;Kiviat suggested that GSA should prepare guidelines for measuring technicalvalue and distribute the guidelines to agencies for use in preparingsolicitations.andM;Ross agreed with the idea that more technical criteria need to be developed,but he said it would be difficult to issue standard criteria that would workfor all the different kinds of systems and services agencies buy.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
