Rehnquist, aconservative Supreme Court majority solidified last spring to veerthe court dramatically to the right. The question now is whetherRehnquist can keep the momentum rolling into the 1990s.   The 1989-90 term, beginning Monday, will offer the beginning ofan answer by July. Although the court's decision docket is not yetas packed with ideologically divisive issues as it was last term,that could change as the justices begin taking on new cases.   ``The opportunities, through the cases, will always presentthemselves,'' University of Michigan law professor Yale Kamisarsays with a dread shared by many liberals. ``The chief justiceshould have no problem keeping the court busy taking the life outof (liberal) precedents.''   The Rehnquist court came of age last term by cutting backabortion rights, curtailing affirmative action for women andminorities, limiting civil rights protections, condoning mandatorydrug testing and permitting capital punishment for juveniles andretarded people convicted of murder.   Conservatives who two years ago were highly critical ofRehnquist's leadership now have high praise.   Rehnquist did not change, but the court's cast did. JusticeAnthony M. Kennedy has provided a conservative vote far moredependably than did his predecessor, Lewis F. Powell.   Justices Antonin Scalia, Byron R. White and Sandra Day O'Connorjoined with Rehnquist and Kennedy in numerous key cases last termto relegate Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, HarryA. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens to the role of dissenters.   That 5-4 majority, however, is not rock solid.   For example, the judicial philosophy of Rehnquist and O'Connor _driven largely by an inclination to defer to Congress and statelegislatures _ at times has been at odds with Scalia'stake-no-prisoners, libertarian brand of conservatism.   ``Rehnquist is doing a pretty good job, but he might not have adependable, operative conservative majority in place for a few moreterms,'' says Patrick McGuigan of the conservative Free CongressFoundation.   Conservatives are buoyed by the comparative youthfulness of thecourt's new majority. Rehnquist turned 65 on Sunday, White is 72,and Scalia, O'Connor and Kennedy are in their 50s.   Brennan, the court's leading liberal, is also its oldestjustice. He's 83. Marshall and Blackmun are 81, and Stevens is 69.   ``We have to face the fact that sooner or later Justice Brennanis not going to be there, fighting the brilliant rear-guard actionhe has fought for so long,'' says Kamisar. ``If anything, theconservative movement could accelerate.''   In the new term, the early best bets for conservative victoriesappear to be states gaining even more power to limit access toabortions and a curtailment of the federal judiciary's power incivil rights enforcement.   The justices have under study attempts by three states _ Ohio,Minnesota and Illinois _ to regulate abortions more stringentlythan allowed explicitly in the court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decisionthat legalized abortion and subsequent rulings.   The court also is to decide whether federal judges exceededtheir authority when ordering a Kansas City school district toincrease property taxes to help pay for racial desegregation andwhen fining four Yonkers, N.Y., city council members for failing tocarry out a previously agreed-to housing desegregation plan.   ``In a very distinct sense, these are solemn and indeed sombertimes for those interested in pressing and advancing basic civilrights,'' Blackmun told a Chicago lawyers' group last month.   The justice said the Rehnquist court's five-member majority``apparently will vote as a group in cases of this kind, and maywell have control of the court in the long years ahead.''</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Richard Carelli has been the AP's Supreme Courtcorrespondent since 1976.</TEXT></DOC>
