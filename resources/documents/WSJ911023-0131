Richard W. Miller, chairman and chief executive officer,said, &quot;The general economy and the state of our industrycontinue to be difficult.&quot; However, he said, &quot;We are seeingevidence that our revenues are beginning to stabilize.&quot;   Wang said its bookings of new business during the quarterexceeded its revenue, the first time that has happened in twoyears. &quot;The company has an attractive backlog of orders as weenter our second quarter,&quot; Mr. Miller added. The companydeclined to disclose the amounts.   Wang's cash balance on Sept. 30 was $131 million, comparedto $233 million on June 30.

In less than three years, Wang has slashed more than 54%of its work force. Currently, it has 14,400 employees, downfrom 16,800 at the beginning of the quarter and a high of31,500 in 1989. The company, which specializes in midrangecomputers used for office automation, has been cutting costsand taking write-downs in each of the past two years whilerevenue has declined.   In June, Wang announced it would sell computers made byInternational Business Machines Corp. Mr. Miller said thefirst quarter didn't include any revenue from IBM products.</TEXT></DOC>
