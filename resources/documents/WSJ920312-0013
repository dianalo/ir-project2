Two other Daiwa officials, along with senior officials ofa client company involved in the trades, also will resign.</LP><TEXT>   The departure of Masahiro Dozen, a popular executive whohad served as president for less than three years, appearedcalculated to clear the firm of further damage from thescandal. Whether Daiwa is now in the clear remains uncertain,but other companies in the Japanese financial world arealmost certain to fall into the widening tobashi scandal.   In tobashi, a customer agrees to buy securities at aninflated price, with the understanding that the securitieswill be repurchased within a fixed period of time at aslightly higher rate, to cover interest costs. The underlyinghope is that market prices will somehow reach the inflatedpayment price. The securities often move from one company toanother as an accounting ploy, driving the face value everhigher. Unless market prices rise to the inflated purchasevalue, one party or another is eventually forced to accountfor the loss. The practice isn't illegal, but facets of itraise questions.   The latest news sent Daiwa shares 7.7% lower on the TokyoStock Exchange yesterday. The stock closed at 775 yen, down65 yen. Since Daiwa's involvement with tobashi was announcedtwo weeks ago, the stock has fallen 19%.   The tobashi scandal is expected to affect the profits ofseveral companies, and could affect the overall health of theJapanese economy, some analysts say. Both Daiwa and TokyuDepartment Store Co., which was involved in a tobashi casewith Daiwa, have issued negative earnings projections for thefiscal year ending March 31 as a result of the scandal.   &quot;It's going to take until the mid-1990s&quot; for Japan toclear up the effects of tobashi, and other excesses of itseasy-money &quot;bubble economy&quot; of the late 1980s, said KennethCourtis, first vice president of DB Capital Markets (Asia)Ltd. &quot;You've got three more years of tough sledding for thefinancial sector.&quot;   Daiwa officials said at a news conference that the companywas involved in a total of seven tobashi cases. Daiwa VicePresident Hiromitsu Sokame said five of those cases have beensettled through arbitration at a cost to the securities firmof 72 billion yen. A previously reported case involving TokyuLand Corp. was settled in late February with Daiwa agreeingto pay Tokyu Land 3.56 billion yen. The other two cases areexpected to be settled soon, he added, at a cost to Daiwa ofabout 13 billion yen.   Daiwa's largest tobashi customer was Tokyu DepartmentStore. Officials of Tokyu Department Store said at a separatenews conference that they agreed last August to invest 92.2billion yen for stocks that were actually worth about 30billion yen. Tokyu Department Store President Mamormu Miurasaid his company's August purchase was the last in anarrangement that began in the spring of 1990, and ended whenDaiwa couldn't arrange to take the securities off TokyuDepartment Store's hands at the agreed date.   An agreement was reached between the two companies throughcivil arbitration, in which Daiwa agreed to pay 80% of thelosses Tokyu Department Store sustained. Daiwa officials saidthat all the cases of tobashi arose from actions of one rogueemployee, who managed a Daiwa's branch office. The employeestill works for Daiwa, the company said.   Tokyu Department Store's Mr. Miura expressed unhappinesswith the result of the arbitration, but said he settled toavoid further costs and bad publicity.   In addition to Mr. Dozen, Daiwa Vice President YuzuruIshida and board member Hiroshi Iyomoto have agreed toresign. Mr. Dozen's resignation was effective immediately,while the other two will leave their jobs on March 31, theend of the fiscal year. Mr. Dozen will continue to serve onDaiwa's board. Mr. Dozen will be succeeded by Motoo Esaka,who had served as deputy president for administration.   Mr. Miura will remain as president of Tokyu DepartmentStore, but Vice President Mikio Akamatsu and board memberAkira Ikumi will step down in connection with the scandal,Tokyu said.   Daiwa revised its earnings forecast for the current fiscalyear to show a 43 billion yen net loss to the parent company,partly due to the unexpected tobashi payments. LastSeptember, the company forecast parent-company net profit of50 billion yen.   Tokyu Department Store revised its earnings forecast to anet loss of 1.6 billion yen, due to 26.79 billion yen inlosses on tobashi and other securities dealings. The companysaid it used 11.09 billion yen in reserves to make up somelosses, and set the rest against expected profit.   In addition to costs from the tobashi payments, Daiwa andother securities houses have been hit by the fall in stocktrading on the Tokyo market and the plunge in theunderwriting of new issues; in 1991, public-equity offeringsin Japan were their lowest in 24 years.   &quot;Daiwa lost {nearly} 8% of its market capitalization&quot; onWednesday, noted Robert Zielinski, senior analyst at JardineFleming Securities Ltd. &quot;If much more of this comes out, it'sthe death of the brokerages.&quot;   Other securities houses are expected to mark down theirearnings forecasts in the next two weeks. At least one,Maruman Securities Co., is also in arbitration for tobashi.Others also may be involved, according to Finance Ministryofficials familiar with the issue.</TEXT></DOC>
