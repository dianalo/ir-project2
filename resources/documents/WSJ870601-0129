Figgie Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, said.    Last year, Figgie had second-quarter profit of $9.8 million, or $1.45 a share, on sales of $234.4 million.    The nonrecurring charge results from the failure of a Florida insurance concern that had served as a reinsurer to Figgie's Waite Hill Holdings Inc. unit. The company had taken another one-time charge of 50 to 55 cents a share in the first quarter to strengthen reserves for some of the unit's casualty insurance and worker's compensation lines. Mr. Figgie said he believes that troubles in the insurance business &quot;are behind us&quot; and that he is looking for acquisitions in that area.    Several analysts previously had forecast second-quarter profit of about $1.55 a share.    Figgie is a holding company whose businesses include fire protection and security equipment, construction equipment, packaging and distribution systems, consumer products, defense contracting, insurance, financing and real estate development. </TEXT></DOC>
