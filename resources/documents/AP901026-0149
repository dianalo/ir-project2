(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A woman who said she locked her5-year-old daughter in her car because she didn't trust babysitters pleaded guilty Friday to a reduced charge.   In an emotional plea for leniency, Chante Fernandez, 24,admitted it was wrong to leave her daughter in the car while sheworked weekends at a shopping mall, but said she felt she had noother choice.   ``I was only trying to get us out of the situation we were in,''Ms. Fernandez told Superior Court Judge Robert Figarotta. ``I hopesomehow you can understand.''   Ms. Fernandez pleaded guilty to a disorderly persons offense,was given a $100 suspended fine and was spared probation. She hadfaced a maximum of 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.   Ms. Fernandez, from Elizabeth, was arrested Saturday afterpolice found her pajama-clad daughter Anjuli in the back of her carat the Woodbridge Center Mall, where she worked part-time onweekends.   Anjuli is being cared for by the state Division of Youth andFamily Services, which scheduled an Oct. 30 hearing to determinewhether to reunite mother and daughter.   Ms. Fernandez was initially charged with criminal restraint andspent two days in jail before posting $5,000 bail. She faced up tofive years in prison and a $7,500 fine, but prosecutor Alan Rockoffsaid he decided to reduce the charge after his office was floodedwith telephone calls in support of Ms. Fernandez.   He said his review of the case led him to believe Anjuli was notneglected.   ``She has lost her child in the last several days, she has beenin the trepidation of feeling she was destitute without a job,''Rockoff said. ``I think that's punishment enough.''   After her arrest, Ms. Fernandez was fired from a full-time jobat an Elizabeth lumber company, but the company has since offeredto rehire her. Her former employer at the shopping mall also hasoffered to make her position full-time.   Ms. Fernandez said she left her daughter in the car while sheworked at the shopping mall because she could not find a babysitter she trusted. She also said she could not get governmentchild care services.   She said she checked on her daughter during work breaks and leftthe rear seat folded down so Anjuli could sleep in the trunk.   Ms. Fernandez was desperate and did what she did ``out of lovefor her child,'' said her lawyer, Kenneth Weimer.   ``My client made a bad judgment call. She was up against thewall,'' Weimer said.   After the hearing, Ms. Fernandez and Weimer said the lenientsentence was a surprise and that they would concentrate onreuniting mother and daughter.</TEXT></DOC>
