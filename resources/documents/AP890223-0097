The case is considered a landmark because Younis was the firstsuspected terrorist arrested under the 1984 Hostage-Taking Act,which gives the United States jurisdiction outside its territorialboundaries when American citizens are taken hostage.   No one was killed in the 39-hour hijacking of 72 passengers andcrewmembers, which ended when the airliner was returned to Beirut,the passengers and crew released and the Boeing 727 blown up.   In a pre-trial hearing Wednesday, defense attorney Francis D.Carter said he would argue that his client led the hijacking onorders from commanders of the Amal militia, a Shiite Moslem factionin Lebanon.   An appeals court has already allowed the admission into evidenceof a confession made by Younis after he was arrested by FBI agentsin international waters in the Mediterranean Sea in September 1987.   The evidence against Younis includes the confession, testimonyfrom passengers and a videotape of the defendant standing near thehijacked plane at Beirut airport. The hijackers were demanding thatPalestinian guerrillas be removed from Lebanon.   Carter won tentative approval Wednesday from U.S. District JudgeAubrey E. Robinson to allow expert testimony concerning Amal oncondition that the defendant testify that he was ordered by hissuperiors to hijack an airplane.   ``If he testifies that he had a direct order, we may allow it,''said Robinson. But he ruled out a defense based on the theory thatall mechanisms of law and order had broken down in Lebanon, and that``any reasonable'' person would have followed a command to hijack anairplane.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ramsey Johnson argued against allowingsuch testimony, saying that the hijacking ``is so patently criminalthat the defense of following orders should not be allowed in thiscase.''   On the use of Younis' confession, Robinson indicated that despitethe decision of the appeals court, the defense could try to persuadethe jury that federal agents induced Younis to confess by takingfour days to transport him to a Navy vessel in the westernMediterranean, and giving him only bags of ice to treat injuriessuffered during his arrest.   ``His wrists were broken and he was sea-sick,'' said Carter.   Younis was lured to the yacht, a two-masted sailboat undercontrol of federal agents, by the promise of what Carter called ``abogus narcotics deal.''   ``It is not something that my client regularly does,'' said thedefense attorney.   Younis has been held at a federal prison facility on the EastCoast that attorneys decline to identify. He waived his right toappear at the pretrial hearing. He will provided with Arab-speakinginterpreters during the trial.   Johnson said that three witnesses in the case are in the federalwitness protection program, and that several prosecution witnesseswere overseas.</TEXT></DOC>
