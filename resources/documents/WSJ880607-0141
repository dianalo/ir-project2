Unemployment was 8.4% of the labor force in May, up from 8.3% a year earlier. The figure was down from 8.9% in April, but after seasonal adjustment the rate was slightly higher than in April, officials said. The jobless total was 2,149,000, up from 2,099,000 a year earlier but down from 2,261,000 in April.    Except for the usual factors caused by the spring season, &quot;there was no improvement on the labor market in May,&quot; the office's president, Heinrich Franke, said.    Nevertheless, government spokesman Friedhelm Ost called the decline from April encouraging and said he expects a further improvement. Mr. Ost said that the government is doing its share by stimulating the economy and cutting taxes but that a quick reduction in joblessness is being blocked by the growing number of women, working-age children of foreign workers, and immigrants from East Germany and Eastern Europe in the labor force.    However, economists said the report showed that German economic growth isn't strong enough to reduce unemployment. Although gross national product grew an inflation-adjusted 4.2% in the first quarter from a year earlier, most economists expect the economy to grow only 2% in the full year.    The average jobless rate is likely to climb to 9.1% this year from 9% in 1987 and will probably reach 9.2% next year, said Karin Mueller-Krumholz of the DIW Economic Research Institute in West Berlin. &quot;It's because growth is too weak and there are still new workers entering the job market,&quot; she said. </TEXT></DOC>
