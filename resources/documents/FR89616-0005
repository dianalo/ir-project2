The Surface Transportation and RelocationAssistance Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100-17 (April 2, 1987), and section 329(a)of Pub. L. 100-202 (December 22, 1987) permitted States to increase themaximum allowable speed limit to 65 MPH on certain portions of the InterstateSystem and other similarly designed highways. Neither statute, however,changes the requirement that States submit information and continue toenforce the 55 MPH speed limit on roads posted at 55 MPH. States are required to certify to the Department that they are enforcingthe 55 MPH speed limit (or 65 MPH, as appropriate) on their public highways(23 U.S.C. 141 and 154). The States must also provide data to support thatcertification, including information on the percentage of motor vehiclesexceeding the 55 MPH speed limit on roads posted at that limit (section154(e)). Section 154(f) provides that the Department shall reduce (up toten percent) a State's Federal-aid apportionments for the Primary, Secondary,and Urban highway programs (23 U.S.C. 104(b) (1), (2), and (6)), for thefiscal year that begins subsequent to the submission of data showing thatmore than 50 percent of the motor vehicles traveling on that State's highwayswhich are posted at 55 MPH exceed that limit. Section 154(g) gives theSecretary discretion to delay the imposition of sanctions in hardship cases,and section 154(h) provides that any funds withheld under this sectionshall be promptly apportioned if the percentage of vehicles exceeding the55 MPH limit falls to 50 percent or below in a succeeding year. The statutedoes not require the Department to hold a hearing before reducing a State'sapportionments. Section 351 of the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies AppropriationAct of 1989, Pub. L. 100-457, enacted September 30, 1988, precludes theSecretary from enforcing section 154(f) with respect to data collectedin fiscal years 1986, 1987 and 1988. The legislative history of this provisionindicates that it was intended to give Congress time to continue its reexaminationof the issues associated with the existing national maximum speed limitlaws, without burdening the States with non-compliance proceedings whoseoutcome might be altered by future legislative amendments. Current Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and National Highway TrafficSafety Administration (NHTSA) implementing regulations, 23 CFR Part 659,provide procedures for State certification of compliance. (FHWA and NHTSAare operating administrations within DOT.) Under those regulations, eachState develops a plan to monitor speeds which is subject to FHWA reviewand approval. By January 1 of each year, each State must certify its compliancefor the preceding fiscal year and submit information to support that certification.Under present regulations, if the State-submitted data indicates apparentnoncompliance, the State is afforded a number of opportunities to explainthe certification and data, before any apportionment reductions are made.The State may first request an informal hearing to show cause why it shouldnot be found in noncompliance or to attempt to resolve the matter informally.If the matter is not resolved informally, the State may request a formalhearing. If no request for a hearing is made, the Administrators will forwarda proposed determination to the Secretary. If a State does request a formal hearing, it is held before an administrativelaw judge (ALJ). The ALJ then issues a recommended decision on compliance.Following review of either the ALJ's recommended decision or the Administrators'proposed determination, the Secretary makes a final determination on compliance.If the Secretary determines that a State is not in compliance, the Administratorsnotify the State of that determination and of the proposed reduction inapportioned funds. The State may request an informal meeting with the Administratorsto discuss the sanction and/or a possible hardship deferral. After thatmeeting, a final decision on sanctions and hardship deferral is issued.<ITAG tagnum="84">The NPRM and Public Comments </ITAG>On March 11, 1988, FHWA and NHTSA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(NPRM) (48 FR 7943) that proposed specific changes to simplify the compliancedetermination and apportionment reduction process and to make technicalmodifications in response to recent statutory amendments. In response tothat NPRM, the Department received comments from several State highwayand transportation departments, two state police departments and one consumergroup. The majority of the commenters_including the Hawaii Department ofTransportation, Maryland Department of Transportation, Georgia Departmentof Transportation, Michigan Office of Highway Safety Planning, Texas StateDepartment of Highway and Public Transportation, and the Oregon Departmentsof State Police and Transportation_supported the proposed simplificationof the procedures. For example, the Texas State Department of Highwaysand Public Transportation stated that the procedural changes will benefitthe State by allowing relevant input earlier in the process, eliminatingunnecesssary steps, and concentrating on the primary factors that relateto speed limit compliance, enforcement, and safety. In contrast, the Massachusetts Department of Public Works, the CaliforniaDepartments of Highway Patrol and Transportation, the North Dakota StateHighway Department, the State of New York Department of Transportation,and the Center For Auto Safety (CFAS) submitted comments opposing the proposedchanges. Comments concerning specific proposals in the NPRM are discussedin the pertinent sections. Several comments addressed matters that would require legislative changes.For example, some commenters questioned the general validity of a Federalrole in speed limit enforcement. Another party argued that the urban boundarylimit in andSection; 659.7 is an unrealistic point at which to require areduction in speed. The Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportationrecommended that the Department develop a system to provide adjustmentsfor states that have raised speed limits on certain highways to 65 MPHversus those states that have not. Since resolution of these concerns wouldrequire statutory changes, the Department is unable to address them inthis rulemaking, regardless of merit. The California Departments of Highway Patrol and Transportation arguedthat the Department should withhold final rulemaking until Congress completedits consideration of pending bills that addressed speed limit compliance.Since those comments were filed, Congress has acted. Although Pub. L. 100-457provides that there will be no enforcement for alleged noncompliance duringfiscal years 1986-1988, it is possible that a State might be in noncompliancein fiscal year 1989 or beyond. In light of that possibility, it is appropriateto have these revised procedures in place to assure that there are no unnecessarydelays at that time. <ITAG tagnum="84">Section-By-Section Analysis of Changes </ITAG>Section 659.15 Certification Content Section 154(e) provides that each State shall submit to the Secretary suchdata as the Secretary determines is necessary to support its certificationunder section 141, including data representing statewide driver noncompliancewith the 55 MPH speed limit. The data is to be submitted ``in accordancewith criteria to be established by the Secretary, including criteria whichtake into account the variability of speedometer readings * * *.'' When a final rule implementing this provision was published (45 FR 64488;September 29, 1980), speedometer variability was acknowledged, but no specificprocedures to account for it were put in regulatory form. Discussion ofspeedometer variability was confined to the rule's supplementary informationsection. That narrative indicated that methodologies available to implementthe concept would be published and distributed at a later date. Until theNPRM, however, no further discussion of this topic appeared in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> Instead, beginning in 1980, the speedometervariability adjustment process has been handled, on an annual basis, viamemorandum from FHWA Headquarters to the FHWA field offices, with the appropriateinformation then passed on to the States. The States then made the appropriateadjustment prior to submission of their annual certification of speed limitenforcement required by 23 U.S.C. 141.FHWA and NHTSA have determined that it would be appropriate to publishthese speedometer variability adjustment procedures in the Code of FederalRegulations, so that they will be readily available to the public. Therefore,we have amended 23 CFR 659.15(d) to set forth the entire process wherebya State produces a statewide value for the percentage of vehicles exceeding55 MPH. That subsection is as proposed in the NPRM, except the letter ``H''has been substituted for ``G'' in paragraph (d)(2) to reduce any possibleconfusion. The California Departments of Highway Patrol and Transportation, citinga study by the National Academy of Sciences, argued that the speedometervariability adjustment process contained in the NPRM is ``seriously flawed''.They also argued that the statute does not specifically authorize the adjustmentsfor statistical and equipment error and that the second adjustment in andSection;659.15(d)(1) should use a confidence level of 99% instead of 95%. We havereviewed this adjustment methodology and continue to believe that it isappropriate. Furthermore, a 95% confidence level is widely used in statisticalanalyses. Section 659.19 Effect of Failure To Certify or To Meet Compliance StandardsMuch of existing andSection; 659.19 implements the earlier statutory scheme,which included a phased-in compliance process. The 1981 amendment to 23U.S.C. 154 (section 1108(a) of Pub. L. 97-35) replaced the phased-in compliancerequirement (which set different compliance standards for different years)with a straightforward compliance standard of 50 percent. Thus, Statesnow must demonstrate that the percentage of motor vehicles exceeding 55MPH on roads posted at that speed is not greater than 50 percent. The regulationhas been revised to reflect the statutory amendments. The California Department of Highway Patrol pointed out that the statutedoes not specifically provide for a 100 percent sanction, i.e., withholdingof project approvals, when a State is not ``adequately enforcing'' the55 MPH limit. However, 23 CFR 659.19(a) currently could be construed asproviding for such a sanction, despite the fact that there is no definitionfor the quoted phrase. Since some might think that this ambiguous provisioncould apply in the event that more than 50 percent of the vehicles operatedabove 55 MPH, and since the statute clearly limits the sanction in thatcircumstance to 10 percent, we have revised the regulation to eliminatethe ``not adequately enforcing'' language, in order to more closely alignthe regulation with the statute. Subsection (d) revises the provision covering the apportionment of fundsthat had been withheld from a State in prior years. The applicable statutoryprovision provides that the Secretary shall promptly apportion to a Stateany funds that have been withheld pursuant to subsection (f) ``* * * ifhe determines that the percentage of motor vehicles in such State exceedingfifty-five miles per hour has dropped to the level specified for the fiscalyear for which the funds were withheld.'' 23 U.S.C. 154(h). The ``level specified for the fiscal year'' language, which was incorporatedin the existing regulation, is based on the Federal-Aid Highway Amendmentsof 1974 (Pub. L. 93-643) and section 205 of the Surface TransportationAssistance Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-599), and refers to the former phased-incompliance process. The Department, therefore, has amended this languageto reflect the fact that under current law the uniform compliance levelis 50 percent. Section 154(h) provides that the Department shall apportion to a Stateany funds that have been withheld because of the State's noncomplianceif it determines that the State has come into compliance in a later year.New andSection; 659.19(d) clarifies that funds apportioned under this provisionare subject to the limitations established by 23 U.S.C. 118(b)(1), whichprovides that sums apportioned to the three Federal-aid systems from whichsums can be withheld under the speed limit law are available for expenditure``for a period of three years after the close of the fiscal year for whichsuch sums are authorized and any amounts so apportioned remaining unexpendedat the end of the such period lapse.'' Thus, funds withheld from a Statewill be apportioned only if the Department determines, based upon an analysisof speed monitoring data for a complete fiscal year, that the State hascome into compliance such that the withheld funds wiil be available forexpenditure. New andSection; 659.19(e) describes the action that will be taken by theDepartment in the event that the procedures of andSection; 659.21 are notcompleted by the date on which apportionments are made for the followingfiscal year (normally October 1). In part because of the complexity ofthe current Part 659, on a number of occasions during the past few yearsthe Department has not been able to render a final determination on theissues of whether and by how much a State's apportionments should be reducedby that date. In order to assure that a proper sanction can be imposedin the event that the State is found to be in non-compliance, the Departmenthas apportioned Federal-aid funds for that State, but reserved from obligationan amount equal to 10 percent of the State's primary, secondary, and urbanapportionments for that fiscal year. This step was taken because a State's apportionments cannot be reduceduntil a final determination is made that it was not in compliance. Yetif the Department did not take the precautionary step of reserving thesefunds, a situation could arise wherein a State would have obligated allof its apportionments prior to a final decision. Then, if the Departmentsubsequently concluded that the State had not complied, it would be unableto fulfill its statutory obligation to withhold funds from that State.CFAS submitted comments challenging the procedural and substantive validityof andSection; 659.19(e). CFAS claimed that this provision was a ``meansfor authorizing administrative delay in order to postpone decisions andavoid imposing mandatory statutory penalties * * * [and] is a blatant attemptat posturing in order to improve the agencies' legal position in court.''CFAS also argued that ``(t)he introduction of the reservation from obligationinto DOT regulations attempts to justify prior unauthorized agency practicethat violates the statutory scheme.'' DOT obviously disagrees. The Departmentbelieves that the funds reservation procedure is a proper response, consistentwith the statute, to circumstances in which a final decision on complianceand sanctions cannot be made prior to the next scheduled apportionmentof funds. The revised regulation merely codifies this process in the regulations.The California Departments of Highway Patrol and Transportation urged theDepartment to not withhold apportionments until after a final sanctiondecision is made. They argued that it would be more equitable to withholdapportionments for the year following a final noncompliance decision. However,in view of the statutory language, we cannot simply ignore the pendencyof an enforcement proceeding. The reservation process allows the Departmentto take appropriate action after a final decision is made.Section 659.21 Procedures Based on our past experiences with the current procedures, we are adoptinga less formal and more streamlined process that will allow a more promptresolution of compliance and funding issues, while still affording eachState an ample opportunity to present its position to the Department. Themajor difference from the old rule involves the elimination of the formalhearing process, as outlined more fully below. The new regulation eliminates steps that have simply proven to be nonproductive,based on the Department's experience. The issue of compliance is generallyself-evident, since it is based upon data compiled by the State (and adjustedin accordance with FHWA procedures). If a State wishes to present additionalinformation to the Department on the issue of compliance, it will stillbe able to do so in an informal, non-hearing context. With respect to theamount and timing of any sanctions for noncompliance, the new rule willprovide the same opportunity for the States to provide information andarguments as under the existing rule. Moreover, under the new procedure,the States will be able to address the issue of sanctions prior to thefinal determination on compliance. Therefore, the following procedures will be used, beginning with certificationsinvolving fiscal year 1989: If the information available to the FHWA and NHTSA Administrators indicatesthat a State does not appear to be in compliance, the Administrators willsend a proposed noncompliance determination to the Governor. This decisionwould usually be based on data submitted by the State, but the Administratorsmay also consider other data if it seems appropriate, such as if thereis a reason to doubt the accuracy of the State's submission. A State will have 30 days from the date of receipt of the Administrators'letter to request an opportunity to show cause why it should not be foundin noncompliance, discuss a possible sanction, and/or discuss a possiblehardship deferral. If a State wishes, an informal meeting will be heldwith the Administrators and/or their representatives. A transcript of thatmeeting will be prepared. The State can offer any relevant information,including materials concerning compliance, enforcement, hardship, and sanctionlevels. In lieu of requesting a meeting, within the 30-day period the Statecan present written information to the Administrators concerning compliance,enforcement, sanctions, and deferrals. (If the State agrees that it isnot in compliance, the meeting or letter would focus on the amount and/ortiming of the sanction.) If a State believes it needs more than 30 daysto prepare its response, it may request an extension of time. Such a requestshould be submitted to the Administrators, jointly, along with the basisfor the State's request. On the basis of the information provided, the Secretary will issue a finaldecision, in writing, regarding the State's compliance and, if applicable,the amount and timing of any reduction of apportionments. The decisionwill set forth the basis for the determination, and a copy will be sentto the State. This procedural change will afford all States an adequate opportunity toattempt to demonstrate to the Department that the data submitted with theannual certification do not tell the entire story, and to submit any otherrelevant information that a State wishes the Department to consider onthe issues of what the sanction should be and whether any sanction shouldbe deferred. The proposal to revise andSection; 659.21 was the focus of most of the commentson the NPRM. Two commenters, who generally supported the procedural changes,urged the Department to specify a time frame for States to prepare theircase. This suggestion has been incorporated. One of these parties alsorecommended that the Department specify (1) that FHWA and NHTSA will jointlymake the written notification of proposed determination within 45 daysof receipt of the affected State's certification, (2) the particular officialor office to which requests for an informal hearing or documents are tobe submitted, (3) which past and current operational programs are to beincluded in the scope of review, (4) the particular Department officialto whom the information is to be submitted, and (5) that the Departmentwill send the State a copy of its final decision. The Department has accommodatedmost of these suggestions in the revised regulation. However, we do notbelieve it would be appropriate to restrict agency decisionmaking to arigid time limit. In view of the variety of issues that might arise, particularlywith respect to the level and timing of sanctions for noncompliance, wehave decided to retain flexibility in this area. The California Departments of Highway Patrol and Transportation urged theDepartment to retain its existing procedures, arguing that the proposedchanges fail to provide a State an adequate opportunity to appeal a decisionto impose sanctions. The new rule, however, provides the States the sameopportunity to offer information and arguments on the sanction issue asthe old rule; neither provides an opportunity for administrative appealof the sanction determination. Moreover, an affected State may still obtainjudicial review of the Department's determination. California also urged the Department to make several significant substantivechanges with respect to the determination of an appropriate sanction. Theyargued that withholding funding for safety projects is inconsistent withhighway safety and that the Department should return withheld or reservedfunds to a State if those funds are to be expended on safety-related projects.They also argued that States should be allowed to make innovative proposalsfor improving safety in lieu of sanctions. We do not believe that the regulationneeds to be changed as California suggests. The Secretary will considerthe issues raised by California in determining the level of sanction toimpose in the event of noncompliance; however, the Department does nothave the discretion under the law to consider foregoing a penalty altogetherin the event of noncompliance. The North Dakota State Highway Department opposed the proposed change inprocedures, arguing that it favors a lengthier process because it delaysthe loss of funds, and that if the hearing is eliminated, there will beinsufficient time for the States to construct a case in their own defense.The Department is aware of North Dakota's policy view that the entire sanctionmechanism is ineffective, counterproductive, and should be repealed. However,the sanctioning mechanism is mandated by statute, which DOT is requiredto administer to the best of its ability. Therefore, we cannot agree thatprocedures should be constructed to create delay in administrative decisionmakingin order to intentionally defer the imposition of sanctions. With respectto North Dakota's second point, the Department has concluded that 30 daysaffords States an adequate amount of time to prepare their case. However,a State may obtain an extension of that period if it can show that oneis warranted.The State of New York Department of Transportation expressed concern thatthe proposed procedural changes will abridge a State's right to a formalhearing, and urged the Department to allow a State to request a formalhearing in addition to an informal hearing. Section 154, however, doesnot confer a statutory right to a formal APA hearing prior to the impositionof sanctions. Under the APA, the Department has the flexibility to fashionother, more appropriate procedures to comply with the statutes governingthe national maximum speed limit. CFAS argued that the NPRM would change the compliance decision processin that it would ``alter the criteria on which the compliance finding ispredicated.'' It was never our intent to alter the substantive criteriafor compliance determinations. However, to remove any confusion, the Departmenthas revised the language of the final rule to clarify that informationproperly relating to the amount and timing of a possible sanction willnot be considered in determining whether a State is in compliance. CFAS also argued that due process considerations demand that the Departmentprovide a formal hearing on the record; that the Department should setdefinite time limits for agency action; and that all final decisions shouldbe in writing and state the reasons for the determination. The Departmenthas revised the language of section 659.21(e) to incorporate the lattersuggestion. However, for the reasons discussed above, we disagree thatit is necessary to set definite time limits for agency action. With respectto due process, the Department is not required by statute or due processconsiderations to provide a formal on-the-record hearing. In fact, to continueto do so would unnecessarily exacerbate the delays in reaching a finaldecision that CFAS has opposed in the past. Moreover, since a State mayobtain judicial review of the Secretary's final determination, its dueprocess rights are fully preserved. <ITAG tagnum="84">Administrative Law Judges </ITAG>In the NPRM, the Department requested comments on whether a separate provisionwas desirable to specifically authorize the Administrators, at their option,to utilize Administrative Law Judges (ALJ's) to determine questions offact. The Department received comments both supporting and opposing suchaction. The Hawaii Department of Transportation and the North Dakota State HighwayDepartment opposed using ALJs to determine questions of fact. Hawaii commentedthat it would add unnecessary cost to the process, and North Dakota statedthat it was unnecessary, since the States supply the certification data.The Massachusetts Department of Public Works and the Oregon Departmentof State Police supported a separate provision authorizing the use of ALJs.Massachusetts argued that because ALJs were the only impartial arbitratorswithin the process, their role should be expanded to include the decidingof both compliance and sanction issues. Oregon also urged the Departmentto use ALJs to determine questions of fact regarding sanctions. The Department agrees with the commenters opposing the use of an ALJ. Wedo not believe that there will be significant factual disputes. Since thesanction determination process is ultimately committed to the Secretary'sdiscretion, we believe that an ALJ would not serve a useful role in thatarea. <ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous </ITAG>Section 174 of Pub. L. 100-17 (April 2, 1987) and section 329(a) of Pub.L. 100-202 (December 22, 1987) authorize the States to increase, withoutloss of Federal-aid funds, the maximum speed limit to 65 MPH on Interstateand certain other highways of similar design located outside of urbanizedareas of 50,000 population or more. These provisions required certain technicalchanges to the regulation, and these have been made where necessary. Finally,other technical changes have been made where appropriate, where operatingexperience has demonstrated a need for further clarification. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation/Flexibility Act </ITAG>The Department has determined that this rule is not a ``major rule'' underExecutive Order 12291. However, because of the public's interest in speedlimit enforcement, it is considered a significant regulation under theDepartment's regulatory policies and procedures. Although CFAS argued thatthe Department must author a detailed regulatory evaluation, such an evaluationis not required, since the changes to the current regulation effected bythis amendment are procedural in nature or are merely technical to reflectstatutory changes. CFAS also argued that the Department should have extended the comment periodan additional 60 days. CFAS accused the Department ``of rushing throughimportant policy changes that are unsupported in statute, prior to thedecisions of the Federal courts on the merits of litigation against theU.S. DOT on its administration of the 55 MPH national speed limit law.''The Department believes that all interested parties have had an adequateopportunity to present their views on these issues. Moreover, this amendmentdoes not constitute a ``policy change.'' It merely streamlines an unwieldy,overly complex procedural scheme that has proven to be unnecessary. Withrespect to CFAS's litigation concerns, these changes are of course prospectiveonly. Moreover, on May 23, 1989, the United States District Court for theDistrict of Columbia issued an order dismissing the CFAS complaint. TheCourt found that section 351 of the Department of Transportation and RelatedAgency Approprations Act for Fiscal Year 1989, which precludes enforcementof the speed limit law against States with respect to Fiscal Years 1986,1987 and 1988, mooted any changes to the timeliness of the Department'senforcement efforts with respect to those years. It then concluded thatthe possibility that CFAS would be subjected to similar delays in the futurewas too speculative to warrant retaining jurisdiction. Because this rule prescribes procedural requirements for implementationof the statute, and because its economic impact, if any, will result fromthe operation of the statute and not this rule, under the criteria of theRegulatory Flexibility Act, it is certified that this action will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.Information collection requirements contained in this regulation have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions ofthe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) and have been assignedOMB control number 2125-0027. FHWA and NHTSA have considered the environmental implications of this rule,in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act and determinedthat it will not significantly affect the human environment. This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteriacontained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that thisfinal rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrantthe preparation of a Federalism Assessment In consideration of the foregoing, the FHWA and NHTSA hereby amend ChapterI of Title 23, Code of Federal Regulations as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20,205, HighwayPlanning and Construction.
