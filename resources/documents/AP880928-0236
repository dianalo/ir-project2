In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a real incentive toborrow heavily. Since inflation was running at a rapid rate, youpaid off loans with cheaper and cheaper dollars as time passed.   And every nickel of interest you paid was deductible on your taxreturn, no matter what you used the money for.   But those days are long gone. Interest rates, though they may benominally lower now than they were several years ago, are actuallyvery high in comparison to today's inflation rate.   And the deduction for consumer interest _ on credit-cardpurchases, auto loans and so forth _ is fast disappearing.   Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, just 40 percent of consumerinterest will be deductible on 1988 tax returns.   The percentage drops to 20 in 1989, to 10 in 1990, and to zerothereafter.   ``If you have not already done so, you should consider repayingexisting personal debts as soon as possible to avoid additionalnon-deductible interest expense,'' the accounting firm of KPMG PeatMarwick says in a booklet on 1988 yearend tax planning.   That goes especially for credit-card debt, analysts say.   In some areas of the country, competition between lenders haspushed interest rates on outstanding credit-card balances down fromtheir former levels. But according to the organization Bank CardHolders of America, the average rate still stands at 18.3 percent.   If you have some money you want to invest for an assured highreturn, suggests the financial advisory Donoghue's Money Letter,what better use for it than to pay off credit card debt?   ``We dare you to find another 18.3 percent sure thing today,''the newsletter says. ``It just doesn't make sense to pay this kindof interest.''   A special problem can arise with a car loan, adds Jerry Karbonof the Credit Union National Association, a trade group in Madison,Wis.   Since many cars are bought today with loans extending over five,six or even seven years, their owners often face an unpleasantsurprise when they prepare to trade them in for new models.   The car's value has depreciated as fast as, or faster than, theloan balance has been reduced, so that the vehicle has no effectivetrade-in value.   ``Paying for the car over a longer period reduces the monthlypayment, but it repays the loan so slowly that it may take threeyears or more before there is any positive equity in the vehicle,''Karbon says.   ``The time-honored way to save money on loans still applies. Aimfor the highest monthly payment you can afford and the shortestrepayment time.   ``In the case of auto loans, it will pay off on your nextpurchase as well'' by increasing the net value of your trade-in, hesays.   The Donoghue organization even goes so far as to suggest payingoff your mortgage faster than the loan agreement calls for, if youcan manage to do so.   On most mortgages and other debts secured by a home, theinterest you pay remains fully deductible. Nevertheless, if you canwork out an accelerated payment schedule with the lender, thenewsletter points out, you can save yourself a lot of interestexpense and increase your equity in your home.   That equity becomes an asset you can tap some time in the future_ for instance, to pay for children's college tuition.   As the Donoghue analysts say, ``the more equity you have in yourhome, the more useful a home equity loan will be.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thurs Sept 29</NOTE></DOC>
