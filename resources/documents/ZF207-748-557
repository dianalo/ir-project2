SAROS FILESHARE AND LEGATO SYSTEMSandM;Saros and Legato Systems exemplify the differences between the OS12 and UNIXmindsets.andP;  Although they have similar goals in mind -- building a systeminformation substrate to manage system-resource objects and possiblyapplication objects -- they have come up with two entirely differentapproaches.andP;  Initially, Saros will be selling a cross-network file managerprimarily to network administrators for use by end-users in office-automationenvironments, whereas Legato will first sell a front-endless product to OEMsand programming teams who can appreciate the intricacies of its products.andO;Both of them will eventually operate in the shadow of -- or supportinterfaces to - -X.500, the forthcoming (don't hold your breath)international standard for directory services, a sort of global database thatwill enable users and applications to keep track of system resources acrosswide-area networks.andM;Saros FileShare is one of the first OS/2 applications to show up -- and anSQL Server application to boot.andP;  But in fact it's systems software that usesthe Sybase engine to accomplish the task of managing DOS and OS/2 filesacross a network.andP;  If you think of the world in the traditional form oflayers you have to wonder how systems software can sit on top of all theother layers, but the modular approach puts such facilities side by side.andM;FileShare was originally designed to be a general object manager by a highlytechnical crew of people mostly from Tandem and Microsoft.andP;  But its foundersdiscovered that their customer set was uneasy enough at the notion ofadopting OS/2 servers, and didn't want to hear about objects and such.andP;  Thecustomers had a real-world problem -- giving users access to files theyshould have access to, and keeping them away from files they shouldn't see.andO;FileShare allows users or applications to manage files by attributes --author, user, date, etc.andP;  -- as well as by as many key words as they care touse (and search).andP;  Because it relies on a database that manages the files (aswell as other objects, such as users, workgroups, etc.), user administratorscan perform set operations -- delete all files last used before 14 July 1988that do not include the key word &quot;IRS.&quot; Or transfer all files used by theWonderWidget workgroup to the archives; the project has been canceled.andO;Individual users can control their own private files, but the system managesgroup access to them in ways specified by the administrator.andM;FileShare thus lets almost any application function transparently as amulti-user application (aside from copyright issues) because FileShare takesover management of concurrent access to files and file-locking.andP;  In the shortterm, some vertical-market software vendors will be using it to manage filesfor their applications.andP;  As more and more application vendors supportFileShare (which isn't a big technical challenge), getting to FileShare filesfrom within an application will be almost as easy as it is now for DOS files,but FileShare does make the network visible in a way that network operatingsystems that let you use files off a server do not.andP;  The user has to find thefile and store it locally before gaining access to it.andM;FileShare's file-management services are extensive, giving users ways tocatalogue and selectively retrieve files, and allowing system administratorsto control access, back-ups, version management, archiving and other taskswith virtually all the power of SQL Server.andP;  At the user's option, a singlefile can be copied by multiple users and manipulated locally (with notice toother users that this is happening).andP;  When any user returns the file, the newcopy is kept as a version of the original, so you have, say, 3A, 3B, and 3C.andO;At any point, those three can be logically merged in FileShare: the user hasto do the work -- redlining and reconciling documents, say -- and thenFileShare creates a single new Version 4 from the result.andM;On beyond filesandM;Because it manages files, FileShare is the way dBASE used to be: An entirefile is off-limits when any part of it is restricted; in other words, youcan't lock records within a file, but just entire files.andP;  Of course, that'sthe province of a database manager, not a file manager anyway.andP;  Yet FileShareis really an object manager under its skin: With proper integration betweenan application and its underlying capabilities, you could just as easilymanage objects for an application and provide smaller-grained control,including locking records if they are so defined.andP;  (It's more likely to beused for database views or applications, notes president Wayne Carpenter;leave the records to the databases.) Other possible tasks include managingsystem resources such as printers, mailboxes or application modulesthemselves anywhere there's an SQL Server to help keep track of things.andM;For such extensions, the product will need to add application logic to dealwith the particular services and operating environments it's working in, butthe fundamental idea of managing system resources will stay the same.andP;  Ofcourse, it's a feature of OS/2 (and other advanced systems such as UNIX) thatapplications are composed of modules.andP;  Only a few of the modules need betask-specific; the rest are more general utilities that accomplish otherparts of the job; and yet other modules are specific to the system platform.andO;Typical of what we expect of many &quot;OS/2&quot; applications, such as Lotus Notes,FileShare is actually an OS/2 back-end linked to DOS front-ends.andP;  Overall, wethink FileShare will be successful if Saros can find a good way to sell andsupport it.andP;  It offers pc users (and their administrators) the same servicestaken for granted in other multi-user environments but not yet fullyaddressed by pc IAN and operating system vendors.andM;The UNIX approach: LegatoandM;FileShare operates on OS/2 servers only.andP;  Although it can operate acrossmultiple servers transparently (so that only the network administrator needsto know where things are physically, and then only at configuration time), itis limited for now to tightly linked OS/2 servers (despite its foundation onthe widely ported SQL Server) and has code specific to OS/2 and DOS filestructures and IAN security.andP;  Legato Systems, a 10-person VC-funded firmrecently started by a group of former Sun employees, addresses similarproblems for the higher-end, more performance-sensitive UNIX world.andM;Their goal is similar to FileShare's -- to provide an underlying facilitythat will enable users and applications to ignore the intricacies of networklayout and accessibility.andP;  Legato, however, is initially going afterprogrammers and developers rather than end-users, since that's where theaction is.andP;  Its first product is Prestoserve, a server performance-enhancerthat only a techie could love-(or install).andM;Like FileShare, Legato's future products will use a database, but one modeledafter the hierarchical system used in X.500.andP;  Legato is interested in beingable to fit easily into the standards-sensitive UNIX world, vhile Saros isrelying on Microsoft and Sybase for standards for now (although it usesmostly SQL Server's transaction and integrity services, and manages a lot ofstorage directly for efficiency).andP;  Long-run, Legato co-founders RustySandberg and Bob Lyon expect they will be providing a kind of system resourcemanager that will work with rather than replace X.500.andP;  It will extend it byproviding tools for system resources to register themselves so thatapplications and users can find the most efficient resources that meetspecific criteria.andP;  In essence, it will provide a medium for publishingpersistent information -- such as the services available from a particularprinter or the applications available on a particular server -- as well as alanguage for real-time inquiries, such as &quot;Are you busy now?&quot; and &quot;Do youhave corporate stationery in one of your bins?&quot;andM;Although the underlying service is general, Legato intends initially to sellspecific versions of it for functions such as printing, communications and &quot;adecent back-up-and-restore service across heterogeneous cpus -- emphasis onrestore rather than backup,&quot; says Lyon.andP;  &quot;We want to turn everyone into anoperator just like they're an operator of the telephone, by making it alleasy and consistent.&quot; It's likely to be a lot easier to sell than objectmanagement.andM;Long-run, both these companies will probably be providing object managementfor self-organizing systems.andP;  In a world of many interacting objects/agents,it may be hard to find the right one to send a message to without theservices of some such global directory.andP;  Legato's language will be one meansof addressing objects that manage peripherals such as printers, fax machinesand new devices of the future.andP;  (Of course, in the far distant future X.500will probably advance to having an object-oriented database underneath.)andM;TOMORROW'S TRANSACTIONS: COOPERATIVE SOLUTIONS and SOFT-SWITCHandM;In the self-organizing object-oriented systems of the future, active agentswill be performing real work (rather than Just searching information servicesfor interesting articles), and developers and users Will want some way ofdefining and ensuring the integrity of the work they perform, i.e.andP;  a way todefine transactions.andP;  Although the system as a whole may easily adjust to thefailure of a transaction or two, the &quot;owner&quot; of the agent is unlikely to beas accommodating.andM;These agents can represent users trying to accomplish a high-level task, orsystem agents that manage resources, deliver mail or perform computations.andO;(See glossary, page 6.) Just as an object is an encapsulated piece of datawith some methods or behavior accessible externally, so is a transaction anencapsulation of a unit of work that transforms a domain from one valid stateto another.andM;The transaction's behavior is visible externally, and it may send messages toother objects and agents anywhere on the systems to accomplish its work, butit maintains integrity of action over time just as an object maintains theintegrity of its data.andP;  The transaction either commits or is rolled back.andO;Thus, transactions are atomic activity, with logic to check and enforceintegrity.andP;  No outside events -- except for those explicitly part of thetransaction -- are allowed to interfere with its behavior (just as objectsrespond only to messages they understand).andM;Time-stretched transactionsandM;But the traditional notion of a transaction sees it as an instantaneousevent: The state of the world outside is assumed to remain constant.andP;  In thissense, it's much like a batch job, notes Soft-Switch president Mike Zisman.andO;(Soft-Switch sells multi-platform E-mail tools and systems.) In fact,transactions can go on for days (also an issue for object-oriented databases;Release 1.0, 88-12); examples include delivery of mail, editing changes to adocument or design, multi-person approval cycles and other tasks that requireinput from several people (i.e.andP;  groupware).andP;  The trick will be to designtransactions that can accomplish their work successfully and with integrityin the face of a changing outside world and possibly conflictingtransactions.andP;  The simple approach would be to lock everything, but realityrequires more granularity so that the world can keep moving while manytransactions are going on concurrently.andM;E-mail is a combination of a front-end and a transaction-oriented back-endthat manages the location and transfer of high-level information.andP;  This kindof back-end capability will be vital for agents communicating asynchronously.andO;E-mail treats the transfer as an atomic transaction with facilities forerror-recovery, integrity, reporting, etc.andP;  In the case of Soft-Switch andsome others, it may also include data translation from one environment'sformat to another's.andP;  In the case of the Coordinator, it may include somecontent-based activity, monitoring the type of message and maintaining arecord of transaction types and open items.andP;  (Who promised a report to Juanbut hasn't delivered it yet? Whom did Alice delegate the customer's complaintto?) And there are nested transactions.andP;  Delegating a piece of work is atransaction, but the parent transaction -- completion of the work -- is stillunfinished.andP;  Another E-mail-style transaction application is the growing areaof EDI (electronic data interchange), with defined transactions for purchaseorders, invoices and the like.andM;In order to build agents, people will in fact be building transactions-atomic applications that accomplish a specific task and manage itsintegrity.andP;  One company addressing this issue is Cooperative Solutions, astartup whose principals left Tandem last summer and started the 11-personfirm this January after a long vacation.andP;  The company's aim is to enableusers to generate transactions for the new environment where &quot;applicationsmay be smeared all over the network and have to adapt to resources --database, agents, mail -- moving around too,&quot; says co-founderKim Worsencroft.andO;&quot;And they still have to be atomic.&quot; Initially these will be mostlydatabasebased transactions, but Cooperative Solutions will attempt to bedatabaseand environment-independent -- unlike most current development tools.andO;&quot;Object-oriented and transaction-oriented people come from different worlds,but we're trying to join the two,&quot; adds co-founder Dennis McEvoy.andM;(The name of Tandem crops up quite frequently; it is one of the firstcompanies to have truly understood the issues of cooperative processing,redundancy, transactions, etc.andP;  Indeed, one of the first independent-agentideas was designed by Tandem's Joel Bartlett into its Guardian OS in 1975-paranoid democracy.andP;  If a processor failed and another processor noticed,the second processor would send a message to the administrator and blackballthe failed processor.andP;  However, it wouldn't tell the other processors; itwould let them notice for themselves -- which they would, eventually.andP;  Thereason? What if part of a failing processor's behavior was to broadcast amessage that another, healthy processor was failing? This scheme ensured thatprocessors couldn't falsely denounce each other to the system.)andM;OPEN WORLD: OSF AND TRANSARCandM;The Open Software Foundation is well aware that selecting UNIX and a userinterface isn't enough; the world needs a &quot;Distributed Computing Environment&quot;to standardize upon.andP;  In fact, you might well argue that the distributedcomputing platform is more important than the local operating system.andP;  It'simportant only that local systems can communicate, rather than that softwarefrom one system be able to execute on another one.andP;  (See Release 1.0, 88-11.)andO;OSF's request for technology is seeking facilities for crosssystemcommunications, allowing applications and agents to interact freely,including remote procedure call services, naming and authentication services(part of X.500), presentation services (data translation betweenenvironments) and a distributed file system.andP;  These components will probablycome from several vendors and will be sewn together by OSF next year justlike the components of its Motif interface.andM;A possible contender for the OSF's blessing is a forthcoming product fromTransarc, a company recently funded by IBM among others and formed tocommercialize the technology underlying the Andrew File System long in use atCarnegie-Mellon.andP;  The AFS implementation is also likely to be adopted by NeXTand of course by IBM, especially if IBM puts its support behind the NextStepinterface/development environment.andP;  Transarc clearly has the technology forits first product, which will be a commercial version of AFS.andP;  Futureproducts will handle such tasks as implementing transactions over networks,with special attention to security and nested transactions, based on CMU'sCamelot, for CArnegie-Mellon Low-Overhead Transaction system.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
