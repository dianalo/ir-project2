These so-called theses will form the agenda of a crucial Communist Party conference next month, the first of its kind in 47 years. Mr. Gorbachev hopes the conference will endorse his reform strategy and cement his political leadership for years to come.    If adopted at the conference and carried out, the changes could significantly alter the way the Soviet Union is governed, by, among other things, amending parts of the constitution.    Approved by the party's Central Committee, the theses appear aimed in part at conservative party officials and state bureaucrats whose foot-dragging has slowed the implementation of Mr. Gorbachev's economic and social reforms, known as &quot;perestroika,&quot; the Russian word for restructuring.    The proposals, which clearly bear Mr. Gorbachev's stamp, concede that the reforms so far have failed to bring about the hoped-for economic revival and improvement in Soviet living standards. At one point, the text of the theses acknowledges the reforms are &quot;to a considerable extent paralyzed.&quot;    To break the logjam, the Soviet leader is effectively seeking to create a political framework in which entrenched bureaucrats and opponents of change, including in the Central Committee, could be swept out of their powerful positions. The proposals also would lead to a much-clearer separation of state and party powers and a thorough reform of the legal system.    Political reform in the Soviet Union has in the past been like playing Russian roulette. The last Soviet leader to attempt major changes in the political structure, Nikita Khrushchev, was unceremoniously dumped by his colleagues in 1964 for &quot;harebrained schemes.&quot; While it's not clear that Mr. Gorbachev will get his way, he carefully has sought the backing of his colleagues in the Central Committee for his plans, presenting them as the views of the collective leadership.    One of the most important provisions would limit elected Communist Party officials at all levels to two five-year terms in office. A third term would be possible only if the official were endorsed by 75% of his colleagues in a secret ballot.    The provision appears to apply to the ruling Politburo and even Mr. Gorbachev,although this isn't explicitly stated. &quot;A Communist shall not hold an elected post in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for more than two terms in a row,&quot; the document states, adding that the same rules apply to officials of state bodies.    &quot;The absence of limitations on elective offices upset the natural rejuvenation of personnel. Some executives started thinking that they had been appointed to their posts for life,&quot; the theses said.    Under the proposals, members of the policy-making Central Committee could for the first time be changed between party congresses, which take place only every five years. The theses say removal of a Central Committee member would need only a simple majority of the Central Committee and would &quot;assure a continuing inflow of fresh forces.&quot; Western analysts expected Mr. Gorbachev to use the party conference to purge remaining conservative opponents from the Central Committee. This proposal goes beyond that, establishing a mechanism to ease changes in the future.    The theses continually stress the need for ordinary Soviet citizens to participate in running the country, through more democratic election procedures with more than one candidate and a greater openness in conducting public affairs. One way Mr. Gorbachev proposes to achieve this is by strengthening and securing the independence of local state councils, whose decisions are now often overridden by party organizations. Mr. Gorbachev often has stressed the need for grass-roots participation in the political process, describing it with the slogan &quot;democratization.&quot;    &quot;Genuine competition, wide-scale discussion of candidates and voting by secret ballot should become a norm,&quot; the theses say.    At one point, the document appears to bring into question even the whole Soviet system of &quot;nomenklatura.&quot; This essentially means that the Communist Party determines who can hold public office. But the theses state that elections should be the main method of selecting officials, adding that &quot;the recommendation of both Communists and non-party people for ranking posts should become the principal method of work of party committees.&quot;    Among other proposed changes, the theses suggest setting up a central auditing and control body to monitor closely the activities of party members. It would become harder to join the Communist Party, and members would face close scrutiny of their views. This would essentially enable the leadership to quickly identify and perhaps purge party ranks of opponents to reforms.    The theses also propose a major overhaul of the Soviet legal system. Mr. Gorbachev, the first lawyer to head the Soviet government since Lenin, has stressed the need for what he calls &quot;a law-based state.&quot; Without giving details, the proposals say that judges, public prosecutors and investigators &quot;should have guarantees against any pressure or interference with their work. They are subordinate to the law, the law alone.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
