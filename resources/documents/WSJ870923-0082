Uzzell's Sept. 8 editorial-page article &quot;Bilingual Education: Immigrants Know Better&quot; was excellent. I would like to add a caveat to his call for letting parents get their children out of the government-school monopoly. In any proposal for vouchers or tuition tax-credits, there is the danger that the reform will be corrupted by the education elite. The elite will no doubt lobby for a requirement that the private schools meet &quot;standards&quot; before parents can use their vouchers there or qualify for tax credits. Such a provision, of course, would defeat the purpose of the reform, which is why we must guard against the provision at all costs.    Education is much on our minds because of the report of the National Endowment for the Humanities and the books by Bloom and Hirsch. Unfortunately, few people -- Mr. Uzzell is an exception -- recognize the fundamental problem of education in the United States, namely, its monopoly status. Contrary to fashionable opinion, what's wrong with the educational system is not that it's too fragmented, but rather that it's too unified as a result of the education elite's political power. If we truly end the monopoly, I dare say most of the problems will quickly vanish.    Sheldon L.
