MacCallum, OUSDA (R and AT/EST), to assess the current stateof the art and to evaluate the adequacy of ongoing effects assessmentefforts to estimate P{sub E}. Approximately fifty people from government,industry, and academia attended the meeting. Specifically, the workshopaddressed the following: current status of operations research modelsfor assessing probability of effect (P{sub E}) for red and blue missionanalyses; the main overall approaches for evaluating P{sub E}'s; sourcesof uncertainty and ways P{sub E}'s could be credibly derived from theexisting data base; and the adequacy of the present framework of a nationalHPM assessment methodology for evaluation of P{sub E}'s credibility forfuture systems. Military operations research (MOR) analyses need to supportcurrent and future high power RF device development and operational employmentevaluations. USDA (R and AT/EST) sponsored this workshop in an effortto assess MOR's current capability and its maturity. Participants includedservice, OSD, national laboratory, contractor, and academic experts andpractitioners in this emerging technology area. Following is a summaryof major findings and recommendations. 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
