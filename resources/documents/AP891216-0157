Thirteen deaths in seven states since Thursday night were blamedon the weather. Blowing snow also disrupted an aerial search for amissing private plane in New York, and ice and snow covered roadsfrom Kentucky to New England. Cold forced postponement of acandlelight commemoration at a Civil War battleground in Maryland.   Police said they were busy with fender-benders, but less so withcrime.   ``When it's this cold, even the weasels stay inside,'' said Sgt.Will Connelly in Omaha, Neb., where the low was 11 degrees belowzero.   The National Weather Service said even though the cold was lessnumbing Saturday than it had been Friday in the Midwest, a freshsupply of arctic air was on its way Sunday.   ``Cold,'' forecaster Mike Wolf in Chicago said, summing up theIllinois forecast in one chilling word. ``Monday through Wednesday.There's no break in sight. Cold.''   In Bloomington, Ill., the temperature was 7 degrees below zerobut the wind-chill index made it feel like 44 below.   Farther south, the wind chill in Kentucky was 10 to 20 below,keeping roads in state's southeast icy. Lows around Tennessee weremostly in the single digits early Saturday and were generally about30 degrees below normal.   Record temperatures for the date were set or tied in more than50 cities in 17 states, including 8 below zero in St. Louis; 16below in Salina and 15 below in Topeka, Kan.; 15 below in SiouxCity, Iowa; and 16 below in Lincoln and 11 below in Omaha, Neb.   The freeze caused a massive ice jam along a 35-mile stretch ofthe Missouri River north of Omaha, dropping waters downstream tocritically low levels, the National Weather Service said.   Other records included 2 degrees in Nashville; minus 6 atLexington and minus 4 at Paducah, Ky., and Louisville; and zero inParkersburg and minus 2 degrees in Beckley, W.Va. A low of 8degrees in Memphis, Tenn., was a plunge of 40 degrees below thehigh reported Friday.   Records in Texas included 9 degrees in Abilene, 11 at Waco, 12at Midland and the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, 17 at Austin and SanAntonio, 19 at Houston, 24 at Corpus Christi and 33 at Brownsville,the state's southernmost town on the Mexican border.   Even Honolulu had a record low: 56 degrees Saturday morning,only three degrees above the all-time record low.   A candlelight ceremony scheduled for Saturday evening atAntietam National Battlefield near Sharpsburg, Md., was postponeduntil Sunday. The wind chill was expected to be 25 to 30 degreesbelow zero. Organizers planned to light 23,110 candles, one foreach soldier killed, wounded or missing after the Civil War'sbloodiest single-day battle.   Morning flights out of Portland, Maine, were delayed by limitedvisibility. ``The runway was there and available, but the vis wasdown to zip for a while,'' said airport manager Barry Valentine.   Snow was falling heavily in parts of New England in the earlyafternoon, with 13 inches already recorded in parts of NewHampshire and more than a foot in northeast Vermont.   High winds and blowing snow forced an end to an aerial searchfor a twin-engine plane carrying six people that disappeared lateFriday south of Albany, N.Y., said Ann MacMillan, spokeswoman forthe Civil Air Patrol.   Some parts of upstate New York had their first heavy snow in twoyears, ranging up to 11 inches in the southern Adirondacks about 60miles north of Albany.   More than 8 inches of snow fell in the Rochester area overnight,and lake-effect snow continued falling Saturday afternoon, NationalWeather Service meteorologist Kim Bolam said.   ``Probably in areas where there are squalls we'll get another 2to 4 inches,'' she said.   Plumbers, wrecker services and ski area businesses said theweather brought cold cash.   ``It's like a Christmas gift a week early,'' said spokeswomanNancy Marshall at Sugarloaf USA in Maine's Carrabassett Valley.``People are still coming in and it's been reasonably busyconsidering how bad the driving has been.''   Deaths blamed on the weather since Thursday night numbered threein Illinois, two in Indiana, four in Missouri, and one each in NewYork, Ohio, Wyoming and Connecticut.   All were in traffic accidents except in St. Louis, where thebody of an 88-year-old woman was found Saturday in a yard less thana block from her home and a 62-year-old man was found dead in ashed behind a store. On Friday, one man had a fatal heart attackshoveling snow and another died after being found covered with snowin an alley.</TEXT></DOC>
