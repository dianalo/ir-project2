Baker III.   ``I think we have a commmitment of the administration here tosupport ... the entire initiative,'' Arens said.   But a U.S. official said that while the Israeli plan had``promising possibilities, much work needs to be done.'' Theofficial, speaking on condition he not be named, said the UnitedStates had been ``looking at what opportunities it affords and whatquestions remain to be answered.''   Baker told Arens the next step would be for Israel to starttalks with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on detailsfor the elections and what conditions would be acceptable to eachside, said the U.S. official. ``They need to talk directly to eachother on that,'' he said.   Arens told reporters he had not discussed details of the planwhich was adopted this week by the Israeli government andparliament either with Baker or with National Security AdviserBrent Scowcroft.   ``I don't think we should get sidetracked at the present time intalking about this or that detail,'' he said.   Israeli sources say the United States is pressing Israel to giveanswers to several points raised by Baker in a letter to IsraeliPrime Minister Yitzhak Shamir last week regarding details of theelection blueprint.   Specifically, the United States wants Israel to say whether itwill agree to international supervision of the elections among the1.7 million Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip andwhether the Palestinians living in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalemwould be allowed to vote.   According to the sources, who spoke only on condition they notbe named, the United States asked Shamir for the answers by the endof June.   Arens denied Baker had pressed him for details. ``It wasn'tpushed at all,'' he said.   Arens said he had urged the Bush administration to grant``wholehearted and unreserved American support for this peaceinitiative.'' Such support, he said, ``has a good chance ofenlisting support among other countries throughout the world, andeliciting a positive reaction from the Arab world, and that is anecessary precondition for this thing to really take off.''   Israel also would like the U.S. endorsement in order to deflectcriticism from hardliners at home who say the plan will ultimatelylead to creation of a Palestinian state _ anathema to most Israelis.   The plan envisions elections of Palestinians who would negotiatewith Israel for limited self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.Following several years of self-rule, Israel would then engage intalks on the future of the lands which it captured from Egypt andJordan in the 1967 Middle East war.   The plan excludes any participation by representatives of thePalestine Liberation Organization, and Egyptian leader HosniMubarak and Jordan's King Hussein have said they would not acceptit unless the PLO approves.   State Department envoy Dennis Ross shuttled among Israel, Jordanand Egypt earlier this week and reported on his talks Thursday toBaker and Arens.   As Arens and Baker discussed the situation in the territories,especially the Palestinian uprising of the past 17 months in whichmore than 480 Palestinians have been killed, some 30 protestersmarched outside the State Department building shouting ``Long LivePLO.''   In a move to end the demonstration before Arens emerged,security officials drove away the cars of the official motorcade asthough to indicate Arens would be spirited away through anotherentrance. But soon after the protesters dispersed, the cars cameback and Arens came out and spoke to reporters.   At a meeting with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney earlier, Arensdescribed a recent escalation of Palestinian attacks againstIsraelis and against Arabs perceived as collaborators with Israeliauthorities, the sources said. Arens told Cheney that bymaintaining its official contacts with the PLO begun last year, theUnited States was encouraging the Palestinians to continue theirattacks.</TEXT></DOC>
