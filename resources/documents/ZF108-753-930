Are accented characters being sorted in the right order?&quot;) Finally,the documentation, help files, and other text--which may have been translatedby separate people--are checked for consistency in terminology.andM;*  Tutorials and templates.andP;  &quot;We try to make sure that examples in tutorialsare applicable to the local market, and that things like sample data filesand titles in templates are suitably generic,&quot; Ormont says.andP;  Hisrecommendation: Have local sales agents or users review the U.S.andP;  versionbefore starting the translation process, to spot potential problems.andM;*  The illustration bottleneck.andP;  Ormont notes that documentation authors nowtend to use more actual screen shots to illustrate their text.andO;&quot;Mechanically, that's a time-consuming process that puts pressure on theschedule,&quot; he says.andP;  Text in a line drawing can be modified easily, butcreating screen shots usually has to wait until final changes have been madein the program itself.andM;*  Timely releases.andP;  &quot;It didn't use to matter if you were six months out ofsync with the U.S.andP;  version,&quot; Ormont says.andP;  &quot;But now the news travels fast.andO;Gray market imports will kill the market if you don't get a native languageversion out on time.&quot; IBM's goal now is to release localized versions within90 days of the ship date of its U.S.andP;  and U.K.andP;  titles.andP;  &quot;That means we haveto start work well before the code is frozen.&quot;andM;Stan Ormont, project manager, IBM Application Solutions Division, 1000 NW51st St., Boca Raton, Fla.andP;  33432; 407/982-3640.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
