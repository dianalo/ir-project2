The maker of hardware, airplanes and military parts didn't specify how large the loss would be. Last fiscal year, it earned $59,000, or three cents a share, including $1.5 million from discontinued operations. For the first nine months of fiscal 1987, EAC earned $339,000, or 17 cents a share, on sales of $88.3 million.    EAC said it has been hurt by deteriorating earnings in its housing business, especially in the Southeast. It said its banks have agreed to waive defaults on its credit facilities and to restructure the pacts, in part by charging EAC higher interest rates and receiving additional collateral.    The company also said it sold its interest in St. Paul Metalcraft Inc. to an undisclosed buyer for $3.3 million, which it used to trim bank debt.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, EAC fell $1.375 to $6.75. </TEXT></DOC>
