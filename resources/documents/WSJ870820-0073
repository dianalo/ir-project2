Danny Wall of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.    &quot;If we end up stabilizing the thrift industry as the traditional thrift industry, we will have failed,&quot; Mr. Wall said in an interview. &quot;We have to stabilize (thrifts) in such a way as to make them competitive and able to be players in this expanding financial services universe.&quot;    Currently, the thrift industry is in turmoil, with nearly one-fifth of the nation's 3,200 savings and loan institutions either insolvent or unprofitable and losing more than $10 million a day.    Historically, thrifts have invested the deposits they hold in residential mortgages. But Mr. Wall, who became the Bank Board's 19th chairman July 1, believes they should offer a broad range of services from selling insurance to selling homes.    &quot;They're positioned as well as anybody, with the possible exception of credit unions, to be in the broadest sense the financial-services provider to the average American,&quot; he said.    Thrifts aren't subject to many of the geographical restrictions placed upon commercial banks. Thrifts, for example, are generally freer to expand their operations across state boundaries. And some states that prohibit banks from having branches don't similarly curb thrifts.    This makes them more convenient to customers than banks are, Mr. Wall said, giving them an edge in providing &quot;the needs of the average family through the course of their life cycle:&quot; holding checking and savings accounts, making loans for education, automobiles and homes and selling insurance and residential real estate.    But changing federal and state laws and regulations to allow thrifts to do all those things would mean overcoming the opposition of the influential trade groups representing real estate and insurance agents. Federally chartered thrifts are barred by law from selling real estate, although 27 states allow state-chartered institutions to act as real estate brokers, Mr. Wall said. Many more states allow state-chartered thrifts to sell insurance and some permit federally chartered institutions to do so through a subsidiary.    Mr. Wall, the former Republican staff director of the Senate Banking Committee, said the only limits on what thrifts can do should be those set by the institutions themselves. &quot;That really is a matter of management,&quot; he said.    On other topics, Mr. Wall said he isn't in any rush to resolve the problems of Financial Corp. of America, the troubled Irvine, Calif.-based parent of American Savings andamp; Loan Assocation, the nation's largest thrift. Edwin Gray, Mr. Wall's predecessor, had sought without success to find a buyer for Financial Corp. before he left office June 30.    Now that the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp.'s $10.8 billion recapitalization is under way, Mr. Wall said the Bank Board has &quot;more time in which to consider what is the appropriate course of action&quot; for Financial Corp.    Mr. Wall also said the primary operations of the FSLIC probably couldn't be transferred to the 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks from the Bank Board in Washington because too many questions of policy are decided by the Bank Board's insurance arm. Moving the FSLIC to the regional banks, which are privately owned by federally insured thrifts, had been proposed as a way of escaping federal pay ceilings and holding onto vital personnel. </TEXT></DOC>
