The phase transition diagram for each valueof {lambda} is studied and the determination of the order of the transitionsis done with great care. The transition lines separating the confinementand the Higgs phase is found to be of first order for both values of{lambda}, while the line separating the Higgs and Coulomb phases is foundto be of second order for {lambda} 0.01 and to have a tricritical pointseparating the first-order line from the second-order one for {lambda}= 0.0001. The confinement-Coulomb line has a first-order segment endingat a tricritical point, supporting the notion that in the pure U(1) casethis transition is of second order.</TEXT></DOC>
