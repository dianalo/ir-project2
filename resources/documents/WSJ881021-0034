The Software Publishers Association, a trade group, expects dollar volume of software sales to jump more than 40% this year, while most analysts are looking for PC sales to rise only about 25%. Last year's rate for both was around 20%.    &quot;For the first time, there is a clear separation between software sales and hardware sales,&quot; says Kenneth Wasch, executive director of the association. In the past, he notes, computer owners have tended to buy software only when they bought new PCs, but now it's &quot;more like the record and stereo industry. Record sales aren't dependent on stereo sales.&quot;    Analysts cite a number of factors for the growth. Users are starting to view their computers as more than single-purpose tools; thus, they are buying more programs. By standardizing program commands, software designers are making it easier for consumers to use different programs, which also is spurring sales. And nationwide the number of stores dedicated solely to software is growing. At the same time, software prices have remained constant or edged higher, instead of plunging, the way computer prices have.    Most important, however, is the growth in sales of updated versions of existing programs. Companies usually offer these updates to owners of the earlier versions at reduced prices -- and as many as one-third of those customers typically take them up on the deal.    Even so, such sales aren't always as profitable as companies might like. Marketing costs to reach the buyers are low, says Pete Peterson, executive vice president of WordPerfect Corp., Orem, Utah, maker of the popular WordPerfect word-processing program. But, he adds, support costs are high. Customers who buy the upgrades average two calls apiece to the company's help lines, the same number as for new customers. His assessment is that WordPerfect's $60 upgrade price is &quot;probably too low.&quot;    New Computer for CDs   Can Go On the Road   THE RECENT introduction of a portable compact-disk system for information could allow lawyers to carry an entire law library into court or doctors to consult a wide variety of medical references at a patient's bedside.    Compact disks can hold the equivalent of 200,000 typed pages of information, and the CD disk drives used to read them can be installed in most PCs.    But one problem is that those computers often are too clumsy to lug around. Enter Scenario Inc., Somerville, Mass., which at a recent trade show unveiled a 16-pound, portable CD computer system called Dynabook. The $4,995 system measures 14 inches by 14 inches by 2.7 inches. Instead of a keyboard, it features a detachable touch-sensitive screen. To call up data, all a user has to do is press a menu item on the screen -- no typing skills are needed.    To sense finger pressure, the screen relies on a new electric system that isn't affected by grease or scratches. That makes the system especially useful for mechanics who want easy access to repair manuals and yet work under less-than-spotless conditions.    Scenario is planning to market Dynabook through companies that already are making CDs for PCs. The system will be available early next year.    The Game of Go   Comes to Computers   DESIGNING programs that can play a good game of chess is challenging, partly because the pieces can be positioned in so many different configurations. The exact number is 10 to the 120th power. Computerizing the Oriental strategy game of Go, however, is considered even more difficult -- its total number of configurations is 10 to the 761st power.    Nonetheless, computerized Go games are emerging. David Erbach, the editor of Computer Go Journal, says about 10 &quot;serious&quot; Go programs are now on the market. And in Taiwan next month, a number of them will compete for the title of world's best.    Still, it will be years before any Go software has a shot at the $1 million prize established by a Taiwanese company for the first computerized game able to beat a Go master. Surprisingly, programs developed in Japan, where the game is a national mania, aren't very good, says Mr. Erbach. &quot;The Japanese think the problem is too hard.&quot;    One of the better Go programs is &quot;Nemesis, the Go Master,&quot; from Toyogo Inc., Lexington, Mass. It costs $79 and has been endorsed by the Japanese Go Association. Toyogo founder Bruce Wilcox has spent the last 16 years mastering Go and developing its computer algorithms. Now, he has come up with a hand-held computer version of the program. The $625 hand-held model, Nemesis Igo Dojo, will be available next year.    Odds and Ends -   TOM SNYDER Productions Inc., Cambridge, Mass., has developed what it calls &quot;lapware&quot; -- computer software for use by young children as they sit in their parents' lap. Together, the child and Mom or Dad figure out the plot twists to various stories. Among the first titles is &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk,&quot; which will cost $34.95. . . . Will monochrome computer monitors go the way of black-and-white TVs? IMS America Ltd., a market-research firm, says that during the first five months of this year, 66% of the monitors sold in U.S. retail stores were color monitors, up from 50% last year. In dollar terms, 85% of the money spent on monitors went for color monitors, up from 75% a year ago. </TEXT></DOC>
