SchlesingerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> F GM LABORAUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) </IN><DATELINE> DETROIT  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Negotiations between the United Auto Workers and the top two domestic auto makers are intensifying, as the companies prepare to announce detailed contract offers and the union decides which company will be its strike target.    Ford Motor Co. will make its first offer today, a month after the talks opened and 2 1/2 weeks before its contract expires. Company officials have declined to discuss the details, but have hinted in public statements that they will attempt to continue avoiding base wage increases and instead will offer lump-sum payments. Ford officials have also said they will address the union's main demand of job security while preserving flexibility to use outside suppliers.    General Motors Corp. will follow with a new contract proposal tomorrow. GM made a general offer two weeks ago, asking for stronger links between pay and the performance of individual plants. The UAW flatly rejected the controversial idea, and GM officials apparently have backed away from it.    The company, however, is expected to stick by some other elements of the general plan, including a rejection of base wage increases, a reduction of cost-of-living payments, and lower compensation for workers in parts plants. GM will also likely ask, as it did in 1984, for lower payments for newly hired workers.    The spotlight will then shift to the UAW. The union's 23-member executive board will meet Monday, and is expected to name either GM or Ford as a target, based on a variety of factors including the comparative proposals. In the past, the union has focused on that company for a settlement and possibly a strike. It then turned to the other auto maker and attempted to secure the same pact. Major differences between the financial conditions of GM and Ford may make that more difficult this year.    Also on Monday, union delegates from around the country will meet in Dearborn, Mich., to review the company offers, and will likely routinely reject them.    Simultaneous with the national talks, almost all GM and Ford plants are holding negotiations with their local unions. The companies have placed a growing emphasis on these sessions as a way of enhancing productivity through work-rule changes. GM already has reached local agreements at 22 of 182 facilities, and Ford has agreements with three of 84 facilities, according to a union spokesman.    The Ford and GM contracts expire Sept. 14. Chrysler Corp.'s U.S. contract doesn't expire until next year.    Ford and UAW negotiators have met mostly in subcommittees since the talks opened on July 28. In weekly news briefings, top officials have carefully avoided any hints of what they may propose. But asked last week whether the company would propose lump-sum payments instead of base wage increases, Ford top negotiator Stanley J. Surma said &quot;we certainly feel that lump sums are something that we will be looking at. It's a proper method of compensation.&quot; Hourly workers haven't gotten a base-wage increase since 1984, but the UAW is asking for raises in the new contracts.    Ford is enjoying record profits, and officials concede privately they don't need major concessions from the talks. Some say they would be happy to end up simply avoiding major new job-security restrictions the union is seeking. If the UAW said it would &quot;be willing to extend the old contract, (they) wouldn't get too much of an argument from us,&quot; one Ford executive said.    In Toronto, where the Canadian Auto Workers union is holding contract talks with the Canadian units of the Big Three auto makers, progress has been slow. Chrysler's unit presented its first proposals last week, and union officials said they don't expect GM or Ford to make their initial proposals until the union selects its strike target. The Canadian union's 11-member executive board is expected to make its decision at a meeting Tuesday.    Stephen P. Yokich, the UAW vice president leading the Ford negotiations in the U.S., declined at a briefing this week to speculate on the content of the pending Ford offer. But he said he was &quot;concerned&quot; about the pace of the talks so far. &quot;We're not moving,&quot; he said.    GM's initial offer of expanding pay-for-performance would have meant a radical break with tradition, where compensation has generally been consistent for workers regardless of circumstances. But the union's sharp rejection seems to have cooled the company's hopes for that concept.    &quot;I think that's something that's going to come,&quot; GM Chairman Roger B. Smith said at a news conference last week. &quot;Now whether it comes in this negotiation or the one three years from now, I honestly can't tell you. . . . It's a very difficult thing to define and get people to accept.&quot;    ---   Gary Lamphier in Toronto contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
