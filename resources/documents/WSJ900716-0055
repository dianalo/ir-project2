Benson said,disclosing that MEI no longer is committed to acquiringLecTec Corp., which makes medical tape, sensors and otherdevices. &quot;We've come to the conclusion that in relation toother transactions pending that we should not give up thosethree million shares&quot; LecTec would cost. Still, he said MEImay take a minority position in LecTec.</LP><TEXT>   MEI hopes to close by mid-August on the acquisition of achain of department-store beauty salons, which wouldrepresent about $400 million in annual revenue. It is lookingalso into the employee leasing business, by which MEI wouldbuy employees from small companies and then lease them back.Mr. Benson indicated that MEI is pursuing an unidentifiedentity that would become the nucleus of that business.   He said such rebuilding efforts are likely to result in aslightly larger loss for the year than in 1989, when MEI lost$5.5 million, or 29 cents a share, on sales of $205.4million. While he wouldn't quantify the anticipated loss --it depends partly on a pending audit following the recentsale of its snack and candy businesses -- Mr. Benson said heexpects the second half to be flat to slightly profitable.   MEI reported a first-quarter loss of $4.5 million, or 24cents a share, on sales of $44.7 million. In the secondquarter MEI sold its candy and snack units to Ezaki Glico Co.of Osaka, Japan, for $58 million. Mr. Benson said those unitswere becoming slim-margin commodity businesses.   It is understood that MEI has hired Salomon Brothers toseek buyers for its nut business, which represented aboutone-third of first-quarter revenue.   MEI expects to retain a healthy balance sheet, withperhaps $75 million in cash and equivalents after the pendingsalon acquisition, Mr. Benson said.   He said that while the acquisition will cost $50 million,about $25 million in Essanelle Salon Co. debt would beimmediately refinanced, reducing MEI's cash outflow to $25million. The acquisition also includes Glemby Co. and Maxims.Terms call for Regis Corp., which owns Essanelle and Maxims,to retain a 20% interest.   Because nearly 2,000 beauty salons, in such departmentstore chains as Sears, Bloomingdales, May Co. and Saks FifthAvenue, would be acquired, MEI is seeking approval for theacquisition under the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust law. Still,the acquisition represents only about 4% of the total salonmarket, Mr. Benson said.   MEI would become essentially a holding company should thepending transactions occur, Mr. Benson said. He added thatMEI has no plans to retire debt or redeem its shares in theforeseeable future.   The LecTec situation has changed because MEI believes itcould achieve better leverage elsewhere, Mr. Benson said.Still, MEI could end up with a position in themedical-products field, because it lent LecTec $45 million toacquire New Dimensions in Medicine, a unit of BaxterHealthcare Corp. That loan was secured with New Dimensionsstock.   Mr. Benson said LecTec is expecting an investment bankerto advise its management soon on its various options. ShouldMEI take a position in LecTec, Mr. Benson said it probablywould be in the range of 700,000 to one million of LecTec's3.2 million shares outstanding.</TEXT></DOC>
