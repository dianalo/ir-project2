In an investigation that began last September with a petitionfrom Bethlehem Steel Corp. on behalf of the U.S. steel industry, thedepartment found dumping of rails by Algoma Steel Corp. Ltd. andother unspecified companies in Canada.   The department is expected to make a final ruling by May 22. Ifthe agency's initial determination stands, the U.S. InternationalTrade Commission would decide within 45 days whether the importsthreaten injury to the U.S. steel industry.   If the ITC finds that imports with an unfair price advantage overcomparable domestic products are harming U.S. industry, anti-dumpingduties are imposed.
