Forthe molybdenum alloy TZM as well as the stainless steel X10CrNiTi 189and the nickel chromium alloy Nimonic 80 A, the metal dissolution dependson both the concentration of the nitric acid and the concentration ofcer(IV). For 21CrMoV 511, the corrosion rates are two to four, and forTZM two to three orders of magnitude higher than for X10CrNiTi 189 andNimonic 80 A. There is no danger of contact corrosion in galvanic couplesbetween these materials. In alkaline permanganate solutions, the metaldissolution of the materials investigated are independent of the sodiumhydroxide concentration. For 21CrMoV 511, X10CrNiTi 189 and Nimonic 80A the metal dissolution is not influenced by permanganate concentrationshigher than 3 g/L. The corrosion behaviours of these materials are thesame, and their corrosion rates are low. For the molybdenum alloy TZM,the metal dissolution increases with increasing permangate concentration;the metal loss is two orders of magnitude higher than for steels andNimonic 80 A. In contact with the other more noble materials, the metalloss of TZM is increased by a factor of three to four by galvanic corrosion.In both types of solutions the dissolution of the metal is regular forthe steels as well as for Nimonic 80 A, while it is uneven in the caseof TZM.</TEXT></DOC>
