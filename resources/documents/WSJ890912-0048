Federal appropriations for law enforcement and drug treatment programs would grow to nearly $10.1 billion under the West Virginia Democrat's proposal, which seeks to add $2.2 billion to what the administration has already requested for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The distribution of funds would give more priority to drug education and treatment programs, and the net impact would be to ask the Pentagon to absorb -- through cuts in its budget -- a greater share of the costs than proposed by the president.    The drug strategy was outlined as Senate appropriators prepared to meet on the fiscal 1990 Pentagon budget today. Major weapons systems cut by the House are expected to be restored, but in a blow to the Navy, the senators are considering eliminating all procurement funds for the D-5 submarine missile program. The nearly $1.8 billion reduction from the administration's budget would still leave $286 million for an increased testing program. The stated goal is to continue with the system but put a brake on new procurement until recent failures are addressed.    Mr. Byrd acted after consultations with his party leadership and senior Democrats on the appropriations panel, but the strategy is foremost in his own effort to recapture the drug issue and confront the budget dilemma facing his committee.    House-passed spending bills for the new fiscal year already provide more than $6 billion of what the administration has requested, and Mr. Byrd's assessment is that the Senate can only modestly increase this total to nearly $6.14 billion within current budget allocations. Further increases would require significant cuts from other programs; Mr. Byrd's strategy calls for a single $3.9 billion drug amendment that would be offset by an across-the-board cut of about 0.5% from domestic and security accounts.    This approach shelters defense more than a potential across-the-board cut under the Gramm-Rudman deficit law, but the net effect would still to be to trim nearly $1.7 billion from the new Pentagon budget authority promised in the administration's April budget agreement with Congress. Moreover, the House has already tapped defense accounts to pay for increased drug-interdiction efforts by the military and Coast Guard, and Senate appropriators are expected to go even further at a meeting today of the defense appropriations subcommittee.    Recommendations developed by Sen. Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii), the subcommittee chairman, would allocate a total of $796 million for anti-drug activities in direct appropriations or transfers as well as $140 million of expenditures, such as for fuel, in support of Coast Guard operations.    By comparison, all of the $3.9 billion amendment outlined by Mr. Byrd would add anti-drug funds to domestic agencies, including $1.6 billion for the Education and the Health and Human Services Departments. The chairman said he will present his plan as an amendment to a pending transportation bill scheduled to come before the Senate today. But he risks being weakened by the confusion and rivalries fostered by the emotional issue. For example, there are contradictions on how to account for $1 billion for federal prisons, and a Senate Appropriations subcommittee today will take up a more modest across-the-board cut to finance just $1.84 billion for law enforcement and corrections.    Separately, a senior official of the Federal Bureau of Investigation said U.S. law enforcement agencies lack the resources to prevent the Colombian drug cartels from carrying out terrorism in the U.S. Oliver &quot;Buck&quot; Revell, the bureau's associate deputy director, told a Senate hearing that the FBI would be able to react effectively, after terrorism occurred, but not to head it off.    Mr. Revell said he believes that, if the cartels decide to strike at the U.S., &quot;the likelihood is&quot; that they'd first attack Americans in Colombia.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
