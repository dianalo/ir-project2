Increasingly, individual women are going to court to arguethat their entire work environment -- rather than the acts ofany individual -- is sexually offensive. But this is believedto be the first time that a class-action suit on behalf ofall women in a workplace has been filed in such a case. Ifsuccessful, employment lawyers say, it could become apowerful tool in future cases.</LP><TEXT>   In the Minnesota trial, three women are arguing on behalfof all past, present, and future women employees of EvelethMines that they were bombarded daily with obscene graffiti,sexually graphic pictures, unwanted physical touching andsexual comments from male co-workers. They claim theseaspects of their work environment violated Title VII of theCivil Rights Act of 1964.   Eveleth Mines, a taconite mining operation in Eveleth, isowned by Oglebay Norton Co. of Cleveland.   The women are arguing, in essence, that it was acompanywide policy to create and maintain a sexually hostilework environment out of a belief that mining was not &quot;women'swork&quot; and in the hopes of discouraging the employment andadvancement of women.   At the trial, the women have asked federal Judge James M.Rosenbaum to order the company to issue and enforce a policyagainst sexual harassment. Judge Rosenbaum must still decidewhether to view the plaintiffs as representing a classconsisting of all women in the mine, or just themselves, adecision he has reserved until after the trial.   Eveleth Mines has argued in the case that it maintains apolicy against sexual harassment as part of a collectivebargaining agreement with the union. The policy states thatsexual harassment is considered discrimination and that thecompany will take appropriate corrective action if it occurs.A lawyer for Eveleth Mines could not be reached for comment.A spokesman for Oglebay Norton said the company does notcomment on pending litigation.   Eveleth Mines employs about 1,000 workers, including about75 women. Lois E. Jenson, one of the plaintiffs, alleged thatshe had experienced sexual harassment since her first day onthe job in 1975. She said she was told repeatedly byco-workers and supervisors that women didn't belong in themines and physically and verbally harassed. When shecomplained about the harassment, she said, she was denied apromotion in retaliation for speaking out. After she filedthe suit, she alleges that male co-workers refused to ride inthe elevators with her and spread false rumors about her.   Jane Lang of Sprenger andamp; Lang, the law firm representingthe plaintiffs, said that the company has never disciplinedany employee for sexual harassment or conducted any trainingfor its managers and employees. She said that the kind ofsexual stereotyping experienced by the women can result inreduced job satisfaction and employment opportunities as wellas emotional trauma.   Judith Vladeck, an employment lawyer in New York, saidthat women who bring sexual harassment suits are oftenaccused of being oversensitive and emotional. She said that aclass action protects individual women from such attacks andsends a signal that the entire work environment is at fault.   In addition, says Richard Glovsky, a Boston employmentlawyer, &quot;a lot of meritorious claims are dropped because thecompany tries to get the woman who is bringing the case toknuckle under. A class action helps balance the scales.&quot;   ---   CASH TRANSACTION reporting law is challenged in suit.   Filed in federal court in Houston, the case is the firstto contest the constitutionality of a new law that permitsthe U.S. Treasury Department to impose stricter reportingrequirements on financial institutions suspected ofdrug-money laundering.   The suit is being closely watched by the banking communitybecause of the potentially burdensome expense and paperworkinvolved in complying with the new requirements.   Financial institutions are already required to report allcash transactions involving more than $10,000. But the law atissue in the suit, an amendment to the Omnibus Drug Act of1988, allows Treasury enforcement officials to engage in&quot;geographical targeting.&quot; Officials can pinpoint suspectinstitutions, either individually or within general locales,and lower the reporting requirement to $100 for 60 days. Thetime limit can be extended.   Both law-enforcement tools are designed to help federalauthorities investigate criminal activity where cash changeshands in bulk quantities, especially drug smuggling.   The suit was filed on behalf of 10 Houston giro houses,currency-exchange businesses that wire-transfer money for afee. The plaintiffs contend that the law is unconstitutionalbecause it delegates too much power to the TreasuryDepartment and discriminates against the giro house owners,who are Hispanic.   In a preliminary ruling this week, federal Judge John D.Rainey refused to issue a temporary injunction barringimplementation of the law, but he ordered Treasury Departmentofficials to get court approval if they want to extend thestricter requirements for longer than 60 days. The challengeto the law's constitutionality is pending.   Federal law-enforcement officials have applied the lawonly once before, but its use has never been challenged incourt, and no large bank or financial institution has everbeen targeted. &quot;There's been very little outcry from thebanking sector, because they haven't been hit with one ofthese yet,&quot; said Washington banking lawyer Amy Rudnick.   That could change. Currency-transaction reports providedetailed information about persons conducting large cashtransactions and the individuals or companies for whom theywork. Large financial institutions have already complainedthat filing them for transactions over $10,000 createsexcessive paperwork.   Treasury Department officials said the new law is intendedto be used only in instances where strong evidence of moneylaundering already exists.   ---   HENRY KRAVIS'S EX-WIFE loses bid to reopen divorcesettlement.   A New York state judge dismissed Helene Kravis's lawsuitaccusing her former husband of fraud in their 1984 divorcesettlement. Mrs. Kravis, known as Hedi, claimed that herhusband understated his net worth (assets minus liabilities)by more than $10 million, causing her to accept less than shedeserved. Mr. Kravis is a founding partner of the leveragedbuy-out group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.   Justice Walter M. Schackman, of state court in Manhattan,dismissed the suit, saying that Mrs. Kravis's claims were &quot;atbest, vague, conclusory and speculative&quot; and that she hadfailed to present any evidence of fraud. The judge also saidthat Mrs. Kravis waited too long to file the suit, which shebrought in 1989.   Mark Abramowitz, an attorney for Mrs. Kravis with the firmParker Chapin Flattau andamp; Klimpl, said no decision has yet beenmade on whether to appeal the ruling. Mr. Kravis wasrepresented by Robert S. Cohen of Morrison Cohen Singer andamp;Weinstein.   Mr. and Mrs. Kravis were married for 13 years beforeseparating. Their divorce settlement guaranteed her a minimumof $3 million and no more than $4 million. In his decision,Justice Schackman said that Mrs. Kravis has received a totalof $7.5 million from Mr. Kravis since the divorce, whichincluded payments under the agreement and additionalvoluntary payments.   ---   NOTED: Joan Story was named as the partner-in-charge ofPettit andamp; Martin's 114-lawyer San Francisco office.
