Eleven Soviets and more than 80 U.S. participants are attendingthe four-day symposium, co-sponsored by the Soviet Academy ofSciences and the Institute for Resource Management, a non-profitgroup Redford founded in 1981.   ``What we're attempting to do ... is to get not just scientiststalking to scientists, or governments talking to governments,'' saidTerry Minger, the institute's president. ``Scientists will lay outthe problem, but we also have businessmen, filmmakers, authors,artists and environmentalists.''   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., praised the U.S.-Soviet cooperation.``All of us see the land's vulnerability to abuse,'' he said, ``andwe recognize that its potential for giving us rebirth may beslipping away.''   Also expected to participate were astronomer Carl Sagan,biologist Paul Ehrlich, former Interior Secretary Stewart Udall,Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus, and Sens. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., and JohnHeinz, R-Pa.   Last summer's drought and heat wave helped thrust global warminginto the public eye.   Scientists disagree on whether the hot spell was a naturalvariation or the start of the greenhouse effect, an atmosphericwarming caused by industrial and auto pollution that trap solar heat.   But most researchers agree that the greenhouse effect has thepotential for melting the polar ice caps, raising sea levels andchanging weather patterns worldwide.   ``We're taking the premise that in fact global climate change istaking place,'' Minger said. ``As two leading nations, what do we doabout it?''   The United States and Soviet Union produce about half the gases,mostly carbon dioxide, believed responsible for global warming, hesaid.   ``This `greenhouse glasnost' is something we've been working onjointly for a year and a half,'' Minger said. ``This is a veryimportant issue to them.''   Minger hopes the conference will urge action on global warming byPresident Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.   Other plans include setting up joint projects to monitor forestgrowth in the two countries, joint educational programs, and a jointfilmmaking venture.</TEXT></DOC>
