But its real aim is to expand its influence on West German politics at Washington's expense.    A vital part of this plan is a Soviet effort to bypass Mr. Kohl and other conservative leaders and reach out to a younger generation of Germans who don't share their elders' fears of the Soviet Union or see the U.S. as a savior.    After several years of cold-shouldering Bonn, Moscow this year turned on the warmth. The Kremlin rolled out its red carpet for President Richard von Weizsacker in July, the first visit to Moscow by a West German head of state in 15 years. It followed by permitting Erich Honecker to make the first official visit by an East German party chief to Bonn; he will go there next month.    Having whetted Bonn's appetite for a new round of detente, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev hopes the West German public's hunger for arms reduction will override the Bonn government's insistence that it hang on to 72 Pershing 1A missiles, weapons that have a range of 300 to 500 miles and nuclear warheads controlled by the U.S. Moscow never paid much attention to the obsolescent missiles, which weren't part of superpower talks.    But it couldn't resist using the pending Honecker visit as leverage to, among other things, sow tension in the alliance and weaken Mr. Kohl, a man who angered the Kremlin by comparing Mr. Gorbachev's public relations blitzkrieg to that of Nazi propagandist Josef Goebbels.    Mr. Gorbachev &quot;is talking over Kohl's head to the West Germans, and they are listening,&quot; says John Hardt, a Library of Congress expert on the Soviet Union. &quot;The Pershing 1As are only part of it.&quot;    Mr. Hardt says the Soviet goal isn't as limited as arms control or as ambitious as wrenching Bonn from the Western alliance. Instead, Moscow wants to breed &quot;de facto neutralism,&quot; making Bonn a voice within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that is more responsive to Moscow's wishes and less attached to Washington on issues ranging from conventional arms talks to allied controls on technology sales to Moscow.    Moscow's risk in making so much of the Pershing 1A issue is that Bonn will hold fast to its position and the Kremlin will back down. West German officials say Moscow wants an agreement on short-range and intermediate-range missiles too badly to lose it over weapons that will be obsolete in five to seven years, anyway. They hope the Soviets will be satisfied with a West German promise that after an arms agreement they are likely to mothball the weapons.    But some U.S. officials believe it is far more likely West Germany will give in. Mr. Kohl doesn't want to appear to be the major impediment to an arms agreement on the eve of Mr. Honecker's visit. He will be pushed toward compromise by public opinion and by his foreign minister, Hans Dietrich Genscher, who is eager to open a second phase of detente.    Moreover, most U.S. officials feel that holding onto the warheads for the German systems is a losing cause after Washington agreed to give up all its similar warheads on this class of weapon. Some West German officials privately hope the U.S. will make the decision, taking the onus off them. But Washington doesn't want to be blamed for pulling the rug out from under Mr. Kohl.    But the problem goes beyond arms control. While President Reagan and his Republican Party might view an arms agreement as a political elixir, the Soviets see it as a tool to help construct a &quot;European House&quot; without U.S. influence. Moscow recognizes that its defense buildup has hurt its political ambitions, so it is trying to reduce Western Europe's defense dependence on Washington by altering the perception that the Soviet Union is a threat.    &quot;They are initiating a situation where they are trying to restructure the security map,&quot; says Ronald Asmus, a research fellow at the Free University of Berlin. &quot;They are preparing the next generation of Germans to think of the Soviets as a basically benign, peace-seeking, European power. Very few people here believe in the Soviet threat anymore.&quot;    Mr. Gorbachev clearly has made serious inroads in West German perceptions. When the Wickert polling institute last month asked West Germans from whom they'd prefer to buy a used car, 42% said Mr. Gorbachev and 36% said Mr. Reagan. There was an even larger gap (38% to 30%) over which leader they would invite to their house and a still larger (62% to 38%) pro-Gorbachev margin when the Germans were asked who wants peace most seriously.    &quot;It is very sad that this is happening,&quot; says Guenter Wickert, the founder of the polling group. &quot;This phenomenon also has great political influence. Arms control questions are so complex that the average citizen must depend on other factors. Their judgments are totally emotional.&quot;    Nothing could have more emotional impact than improved relations between East and West Germany. Moscow hopes these will strengthen communist East Germany's stability by enhancing its legitimacy and make capitalist West Germany a more willing economic and political partner.    Aside from official meetings, Mr. Honecker in September will visit his birthplace in the Saarland and Karl Marx's home in Trier. Rumors also abound that East Germany will make it easier for its citizens to visit West Germany after Mr. Honecker returns home. West German officials already estimate that one million East Germans will visit the West this year, compared to just 60,000 two years ago.    But a West German official says that whatever the Soviets and East Germans give is done unilaterally -- and their concessions also can be revoked unilaterally. But what carrots West Germany gives in return -- credits and perhaps a commitment to scrap the Pershing 1As -- are nearly impossible to get back. &quot;They can reverse what they are doing whenever they find it necessary, and we can't,&quot; he complains. </TEXT></DOC>
