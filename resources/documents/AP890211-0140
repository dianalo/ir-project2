Baker III said Saturday.   Launching a weeklong trip to 14 West European capitals, Bakersaid he had not decided whether an incident a week ago means the PLOhas reneged on Arafat's pledge renouncing terrorism. In theconfrontation, Israeli forces intercepted and killed five guerillaswho were carrying identification papers linking them to two factionsof the PLO.   The pledge and the statement by the Palestinian leader acceptingIsrael's right to exist prompted the Reagan administration lastDecember to open talks with the PLO after a 13-year official ban.   ``We are not prepared at this time to say this constitutes actionby the PLO to cause us to break off the dialogue,'' Baker said on aflight from Ottawa, Canada, where he opened U.S. consultations withNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization members on Friday.   But, Baker said, Robert Pelletreau, the U.S. ambassador toTunisia, had informed PLO officials there that the clash lastweekend was the kind of action ``that presents us with greatdifficulty.''   In fact, Baker said, ``We made the point that actions such asthis _ directed against civilians or military targets, inside oroutside of Israel _ were something that gave us trouble.''   The U.S. decision to talk to the PLO boosted Arafat's standing inthe international community. Since then, he has gained increasedsupport from West European governments.   Israel, meanwhile, sharply disagreed with the U.S. decision.After the clash, Israeli leaders said the five guerillas _ fourPalestinians and a Lebanese _ had tried to infiltrate Israel tocarry out a terrorist raid.   Israeli Ambassador Moshe Arad complained to Baker on Wednesday inWashington and said the incident showed the PLO had not changed itstactics despite Arafat's pledge.   Baker said terrorism was one of the issues he intended to discusswith the 14 foreign ministers he will see on his European tour.   Baker said he hoped to encourage ``a collective'' approach, butthat he would not ``foreclose'' unilateral retaliation.   The United States bombed Tripoli, Libya, in 1986 in what wasdescribed by the Reagan administration as retaliation for Libyaninvolvement in a terrorist attack on a West German nightclubfrequented by Americans.   Baker met for nearly two hours in Iceland with Foreign MinisterJohn Baldvin Hannibalsson.   He then flew to London for meetings Sunday with British PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher and Sir Geoffrey Howe, the Britishforeign secretary.   Baker said the NATO alliance was ``extraordinary important'' tothe Bush administration as it shapes its foreign policy.   ``We want them to be in on the takeoff so they can be in on thelanding with respect to policy formulation as this administrationgets started,'' he said in an airborne news conference.   Baker again rejected any suggestion the administration wasfoot-dragging in dealing with the Soviet Union on arms control andother issues.   He said an ongoing review of U.S.-Soviet relations could promptsome U.S. policy changes, but gave no specific examples.   On a related issue, he confirmed he would meet an early Marchwith Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Vienna asNATO and the Warsaw Pact open negotiations on reducing non-nuclearforces in Europe.   Baker said the Bush administration had not decided when to resumenegotiations with the Soviets to reduce long-range nuclear weapons.The Reagan administration had decided tentatively on next Wednesday,Feb. 15.</TEXT></DOC>
