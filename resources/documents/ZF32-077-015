(confusion surrounding the release of WordPerfectfor Windows)andM;</TITLE><SUMMARY>The information in a recent press release regarding WordPerfectfor Windows (WPW) is at odds with some already known facts aboutthe yet-to-be-released product.andP;  According to the press release,WPW has been in alpha test in-house since May 1991.andP;  Yet theproduct was ostensibly demonstrated at the Which Computer? show inApr 1991 and was featured in the May '91 issue of a majormagazine.andP;  The article in that journal stated the package wasscheduled for release in Jun 1991, hardly likely if it was only inalpha test in May. With the release date now expected to be inSeptember at the earliest, the most likely explanation is thatWordPerfect Corp has been indulging in a bit of creative marketingto keep up interest in a delayed product.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   WordPerfect Corp. (Marketing).andO;Product:   WordPerfect for Windows (Word processing software) (Marketing).andO;Topic:     Product DelayMarketing StrategyAnalysisWord processing software.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Ho ho, have we got a story for you!andP;  In a press release entitled WordPerfectfor Windows Enters Beta Testing, we're informed: &quot;WordPerfect Corproation hasbegun beta testing WordPerfect for Windows, sending out copies to beta sitesthroughout the world, including the UK.&quot;andM;Why is the company telling us it's still working on a product that isn't yetfinished?andP;  Apparently, &quot;several hundred WordPerfect employees have beeninvolved in the alpha testing to create a stable product for beta testers.&quot;andO;Well, that's reassuring.andP;  And at least we're all clear on the availabilitydate: &quot;WordPerfect for Windows will be available in 1991.&quot;andM;Talking of dates, the last sentence in the opening paragraph of the pressrelease was interesting: &quot;The product has been tested in-house since May.&quot;andO;This caused a few frowns in the office.andP;  May?andP;  How so?andM;Didn't we, and most of the rest of the world, see WordPerfect for Windows atThe Which?andP;  Computer show?andP;  And wasn't the Which?andP;  Computer Show held inApril (sounds of diaries being scrabbled through)?andM;April 23, to be precise.andP;  Then we spotted something else.andP;  Didn't a prominentmonthly magazine feature WordPerfect for Windows on the cover of the Mayissue, which came out in mid/late April?andP;  Curiouser and curiouser...andM;The same magazine stated that the product should ship 'end June'.andP;  Now, ifthey received it 'in-house' in May and expected to get it out by 'end June',that ain't a very long beta test cycle, is it?andM;Or maybe the press release is wrong.andP;  Well, that's not so unusual, companieshave got it wrong before.andP;  But then again...andM;Perhaps it's cynical of us, but we see it thus: in a desperate attempt to getsome publicity for a half-started product, WordPerfect allows the prominentmonthly magazine into its building and shows the journalists (that is,doesn't allow them to take it away), what is demonstrably an alpha codeproduct, allows them to write their cover story, and then sits back to waitfor the flood of orders.andM;When the rather 'enthusiastic' schedule falls flat on its face and the launchis put back to September at the very earlieast, WordPerfect has to wait.andM;At least it has the front cover of a magazine sporting a very favourablereview to wave at people when they enquire about their Windows product.andM;The motivation seems clear.andP;  Now it has something to boast about, a pressrelease is forwarded so that we can publish stuff about them and ressurectflagging visibility.andP;  Glad we can oblige.andM;And finally, all of us at the Percy Desk would like to wish a fond farewellto Wonderfulist Deputy Editor In The World and the Sweetest Production EditorIn The World and hope that they have a terrifically super time in hospital.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
