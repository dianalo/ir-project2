<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-87-0872 </DOCNO><TEXT>The increasing use of obstetric US have revealed that many anomalous conditionsmay be diagnosed early enough in pregnancy to allow termination of thepregnancy or institution of appropriate therapy. In the fetal head, hydrocephaly,holoprosencephaly, and other cystic conditions may be diagnosed reliablyafter the 18th week. In the neck, masses described include cystic hygroma,cervical meningomyelocele, goiter, and hemangioma. In the chest, pleuraleffusion, cystic adenomatoid malformation and diaphragmatic hernia havebeen commonly reported. Many structure anomalies of the heart can beidentified prenatally. In some cases, dysrhythmias have been successfullytreated with medical therapy. In the abdomen, omphalocele, astroschisis,and bowel atresia are commonly reported. Most structural renal anomaliesof the newborn are also diagnosable. A great deal of attention is currentlydevoted to interventional techniques for relieving bladder neck obstruction.Examination of the fetal spine is critical, and it should be possibleto recognize dysraphism, even if a protruding mass is not present. Scrutinyof the fetal extremities allows detection of homozygous forms of dwarfismin the first half of pregnancy, but the heterozygous forms (typical achondroplasticdwarf) cannot be identified until the third trimester.</TEXT></DOC>
