 A distributeddatabase lets many users share information; multimedia databases,which incorporate text, numbers, graphics, video and audio, arethe newest type of distributed database.andP;  Informix' InformixOnLine is an early example of the next generation of databasetechnology.andP;  A system developed from the individual perspective isneeded if distributed multimedia computing is to succeed in the1990s.andP;  Such a system will require an object-oriented database,customizable end-user programming, and a 'polymedia' database thatextends beyond presentation to include different types of storagemedia.andP;  Most data can already be considered in terms of structureddata objects; using it creatively will circumvent any need for astandardized syntax.andP;  Early polymedia database tools include AppleComputer Inc's HyperCard and the NeXT Interface Builder.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Multimedia technologyForecastingFuture of ComputingDistributed ProcessingData base management systems.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>As the kinds of storage devices that provide information to your computerproliferate -- from hard disks to CD ROMs to read/write optical disks -- it'stime to prepare for the next evolution in database management that this newera of personal storage makes possible.andM;Distributed databases already have gained popularity in corporate America,multimedia databases are just emerging, and coming around the next bend arewhat I call &quot;polymedia&quot; databases.andM;During the past 10 years, distributed databases, which allow many users toshare information on a variety of databases, have migrated from thelaboratories into the marketplace.andP;  The boon in relational databases, SQL andadvances in computer networking options have set the stage for rapidadvancement of distributed databases.andP;  IBM, Oracle, Sybase and a host ofother vendors have helped this field take off.andM;The multimedia database -- which incorporates such diverse data types astext, numbers, graphics, audio and video -- is the latest innovation indatabase technology to hit the scene.andP;  The most impressive of these newcomersis the Informix OnLine multimedia database that uses data structures definedas BLOBS (binary large objects) capable of containing up to 2G bytes ofdiverse data.andM;Despite this progress, the user still needs an individual way to organizeinformation (remember, it's still called the personal computer!).andO;Distributed databases are geared for organizational computing, with multiuserconcerns in mind.andP;  Because each person's way of viewing and handlinginformation is different, what's needed is something developed from theindividual rather than the organizational perspective.andM;The answer lies in this bevy of buzzwords: a customizable, end-userprogrammable, object-oriented, distributed, multimedia database system; orsimply, a polymedia database.andP;  Such a database extends beyond thepresentation of multiple types of media, as in multimedia, to includedifferent types of storage media.andP;  These include your local hard disk, CD ROMdrive and -- perhaps soon -- a read/write optical drive, in combination withoutside information sources, such as network servers, mainframe (or evensupercomputer) hosts and on-line information services.andM;There's more to polymedia than meets the eye.andP;  The other half of the puzzleis the system that polymedia databases employ to organize data that must bestructured into data objects.andP;  Although you may not think so, most of yourdata is already structured in this manner.andM;Virtually all of your files can already be considered structured dataobjects: text, database, spreadsheet and graphics files all follow awell-defined file structure and syntax.andP;  Creative use of existing dataobjects will spare us from a pointless search for the holy grail of astandard data-object syntax.andM;Let's go into the future and look backward.andP;  Here's how you might organizeand customize your personal computer.andP;  First, you'll have the latestgraphical user interfaces and hardware that can support hundreds of megabytesof data, motion video and sound.andP;  Then you'd need to collect all the relevantinformation about your particular system; this might include manuals,schematic diagrams, information stored on your department's server, abulletin board number for technical support, utility files on CompuServe,some instructional videos and maybe even a technical reference tome on CDROM.andM;Some polymedia database tools are already beginning to emerge.andP;  HyperCard andits imitators, such as ToolBook, Plus and Windowcraft, allow users tointegrate a variety of data types into a personalized information system.andO;However, they all require more technical know-how than the average businessuser can handle.andM;The NeXT Interface Builder offers a better example of erector-setprogramming, using on-screen objects that can snap together to createfunctional interface programs; but this system is basically aimed at softwaredevelopers.andP;  We applaud these industry efforts and would like to see more.andM;For here's the beauty of the polymedia, polymorphic transformation: By merelyusing the power of your personal computers to work with the data objects youalready have, you can combine access to generalized data on mainframes withthe transparent interweaving of personal information stored locally on yourown systems.andP;  Although people across the world can share similar data, eachuser's experience of the data's presentation and their interaction with theinformation will be a matter of personal choice.andM;The ultimate result of using polymedia databases is this: You can combinemany types of data, both locally and at distant sites, to create a personalvirtual database.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
