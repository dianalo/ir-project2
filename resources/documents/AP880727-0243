The Occupational Safety and Health Administration initiallyproposed fines totalling $1.3 million but later downgraded some ofits citations for safety violations and reduced the fines, said IPspokesman Richard White.   IP promised not to contest the citations, to pay the fines byAug. 15 and to correct any remaining violations, but it did notadmit any wrongdoing, company officials said.   OSHA officials did not comment on the settlement. TedFitzgerald, an OSHA spokesman in Boston, said the agency wouldannounce its findings Thursday.   ``In those instances where safety deficiencies were brought toour attention, we moved swiftly to correct them,'' Jim Thompson,the mill's resident manager, said in a prepared statement. ``Infact, an overhwleming majority of the items cited by OSHA havealready been corrected.''   ``We will continue to do everything possible to ensure we are incompliance with all state and federal regulations as the safety ofour employees is our highest priority,'' he added.   Spokesmen for unions representing more than 1,200 IP workers whohave been on strike since June 1987 said they would not commentuntil Thursday. The company has continued to run the mill with whatit says are permanent replacement workers.   The unions went on strike over wages but subsequently havesought to publicize the alleged safety violations.   White said OSHA agreed to downgrade the severity of citationspreviously categorized as ``willful'' to ``serious.''   The settlement covers 197 citations for about 1,000 individualviolations found during OSHA inspections in January and June, Whitesaid. That includes 29 citations previously classified as``willful,'' 122 in the less severe ``serious'' category, 14``repeat'' citations and 32 listed as ``other.''   White said the violations were similar to those cited in apreliminary list released earlier by the striking unions.   That list cited such things as flammable liquids stored inunapproved containers, fire extinguishers that were improperlydischarged, unguarded fan blades and oxygen stored with fuel gas.   The company is appealing a $242,000 fine levied by OSHA lastOctober for a separate series of safety violations.</TEXT></DOC>
