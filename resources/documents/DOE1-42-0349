This draft supplement to the final environmental impactstatement of December 1983, which proposed an 18.6-mile subway from UnionStation to North Hollywood, analyzes the impacts of five constructionalternatives for the Metro Rail project beyond the initial 4.4-mile segment,extending from the yard and shops new Union Station to the Wilshire/AlvaradoStation. Reconsideration of the project design was prompted, in part,by discovery of subsurface methane gas, a situation that would precludeexcavation in some areas along the originally proposed route. The system,including the initial segment, would attract 296,000 to 354,000 dailyboardings which, along with the supporting bus network, would resultin a substantial increase in transit use. Land use policies of localand regional plans would be supported. Daily automobile mileage withinthe area would decline significantly, resulting in substantial energysavings. Traffic conditions on more than half of Southern California'smost intensely developed section, the regional core, would improve, andthe project would allow creation of a significant amount of commercialdevelopment within the core. Additional traffic would affect local arterialand collector streets near metro stations, and parking in nearby residential-areascould become a problem. Displacement of commercial and residential unitswould occur, and some units would be required to relocate outside thearea.</TEXT></DOC>
