Comparison of the arthrographical diagnosis with the intraoperativediagnosis showed good agreement. Diagnosis of the isolated tear of thetibio-fibular syndesmosis revealed a sensitivity of 90% and a specificityof 67%. The technical procedure and the isolated tear of the tibiofibularsyndesmosis in combination with other capsuleligament lesions are presented,using typical X-ray images as examples.</TEXT></DOC>
