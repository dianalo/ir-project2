Shell said that this was the largest contract it has awarded in Norway and that Draugen will be the first field operating in the Haltenbanken region, about 62 miles off Norway's coast.    Norwegian Contractors will begin engineering in October, construction in June 1990 and installation of the 940 1/2-foot-tall base at the field in May 1993. Draugen, in offshore block 6407/9, is expected to cost a total of 10.8 billion kroner to develop.    Storage cells in the base will hold a week's oil production, averaging 90,000 barrels a day. Draugen has recoverable reserves of 428 million barrels, in addition to natural gas.    Shell, with a 21% interest, operates Draugen for its partners, the Norwegian state oil company Statoil AS, with a 65% stake, and BP Petroleum Development of Norway AS, 14%. </TEXT></DOC>
