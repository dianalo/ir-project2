The correlation has long been suggested, but a recentreport from the National Center for Health Statistics,drawing on a national survey of almost 50,000 households and125,000 people, provides the most extensive picture yet. Thestudy also found that the correlation between education andhealth transcends income levels.   Almost one in four people with less than a high schooleducation say they are in poor or only fair health, comparedwith a mere 3% of college graduates, the study found.   Detailed illness figures bear out these self-assessments.Better than one in four non-high-school graduates are limitedin daily activity due to some chronic condition, comparedwith only one in 13 college graduates. Not quite 18% of thosewho hadn't finished high school are hospitalized each year,nearly 2 1/2 times the rate for college graduates, and theyaveraged 3 1/2 times more days spent in hospitals.   Those who didn't finish high school were over 2 1/2 timesmore likely to have arthritis or diabetes than were peoplewith a high school diploma or better. They were also morethan twice as apt to have heart trouble, five times moresubject to emphysema, twice as likely to have high bloodpressure or ulcers, and twice as liable to have visual orhearing impairments.   Many previous studies have also correlated health withincome, but the National Center survey showed that even amongpeople in the same income group, those with less educationwere much less healthy than the bettereducated ones and madeconsiderably greater use of medical services.                                                                                                          Weight Weighs Heavy   On Female Teens                                                                                                          FEMALE adolescents worry a lot more about being overweightthan do their male counterparts, a federal agency finds.   The Centers for Disease Control asked more than 11,600representative high school students whether they consideredthemselves too fat, too thin or about right. More than athird of the girls thought they were overweight, comparedwith fewer than 15% of the boys. Only 7% of the girlsregarded themselves as underweight, while more than doublethat proportion of boys did. Among both sexes, black studentswere far less apt than whites or Hispanics to considerthemselves too heavy.   The survey found that 43.6% of the female students,including more than one-fourth of those who consideredthemselves the right weight, were currently trying to losepounds, more than triple the male rate. Female students were&quot;significantly more likely&quot; than the males to be skippingmeals, taking diet pills or inducing vomiting to lose weight.   CDC officials warn that such weight-loss behavior amongteens can have &quot;serious long-term adverse healthconsequences,&quot; such as a greater likelihood of obesity inadulthood, nutritional deficiencies, a slower rate of growth,and delays in pubertal and psychosocial development.                                                                                                          Kids Give the Lowdown   On Parents' School Role                                                                                                          PARENTS' involvement in their children's schooling fallsfar short of what's needed, the government asserts.   Wide discrepancies exist between what parents say they doand what their children say the parents do, according to theDepartment of Education's Office of Educational Research andImprovement.   A landmark survey of 25,000 eighth-graders and theirparents found that almost four out of five parents said theyregularly discussed schoolwork with their children. Yetnearly two-thirds of the eighth-graders said their parents&quot;rarely&quot; or &quot;never&quot; talked to them about classes and schoolprograms.   Two-thirds of the parents claimed to enforce limits ontelevision viewing, but two-thirds of the students said theparents didn't. In fact, the study notes, the eighth-gradersaveraged 21.4 hours a week watching television, nearly fourtimes the 5.6 hours they spent on homework.   The school itself was unknown territory to most of theparents. Only half had attended a school meeting during theacademic year, fewer than a third had visited theirchildren's classes, and two-thirds said they had never talkedto school officials about their kids' programs and work.   In a separate analysis of the same data, a University ofChicago team of education researchers found that studentswhose parents talked with them about schoolwork usually gotnoticeably higher grades. TV restrictions at home also tendedto boost grades.   &quot;The burden of education should not be teachers' andschools' alone,&quot; the Education Department study says.&quot;Parents have a major role to play.&quot;                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          SUNDAY brunch isn't just for yuppies, the RoperOrganization says. Its surveys indicate that one in sevenAmericans goes out for breakfast or brunch on any particularSunday, with middle-income men and women more inclined to doso than the more affluent, and with the over-60 set morebrunch-prone than younger people. . . . A tad behind thenews: The U.S. Census Bureau and the Soviet State Committeeon Statistics have just jointly published a compilation ofkey economic and demographic indicators for the twocountries. Admitting to having been overtaken by events,Census Bureau officials say similar data is now beingcompiled for the individual republics.</TEXT></DOC>
