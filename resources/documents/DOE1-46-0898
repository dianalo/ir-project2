Design features for generalized targetsinclude characterization of window materials and cooling, target sizeand shape, beam size and profile, and chamber cooling and operating pressure.A cylindrical design is employed that utilizes a C-ring for sealing thetarget window to the target body. Ultrapure materials are required forfabrication of {sup 11}C and {sup 18}F targets. Use of welded jointsare to be limited on all targets and eliminated on {sup 18}F systems.Tomographic techniques will be used to determine the cross-sectionaltemperature profile of target gases during bombardment. Mass speciesare measured with a sector focused mass spectrometer while the targetundergoes particle irradiation for production of clinical agents. Thisdiagnostic information is useful for tailoring the bombardment conditionsto achieve optimal precursor production and the highest specific activitythat may be obtained from the target.</TEXT></DOC>
