HilderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CSVEARNINGS (ERN) </IN><DATELINE> BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>    Columbia Savings andamp; LoanAssociation said it will post a fourth-quarter net loss ofabout $25 million if its common stock portfolio doesn'trebound from its currently depressed value caused by themarket's slide.   The loss projection was contained in Columbia's report of its third-quarter earnings, which fell 19% to $31.2 million, or 68 cents a fully diluted share, from the year-earlier's $38.5 million, or 85 cents a fully diluted share.    Columbia -- best-known for its more than $2.6 billion portfolio of high-yield, low-rated corporate debt securities known as junk bonds -- also holds common stocks that had a market value of $197 million at the end of last year.    &quot;As a result of the severe decline in stock market prices, Columbia has experienced significant unrealized losses subsequent to Sept. 30 in its corporate-equity securities portfolio,&quot; Thomas Spiegel, president, said in a statement.    Columbia wouldn't disclose the current value of its stock holdings and wouldn't specify the size of the unrealized losses. However, based on the projected $25 million loss and recent results of Columbia's other operations, the decline in market value of Columbia's stock holdings probably exceeds $30 million. Columbia wouldn't comment on that estimate.    For the nine months, net income fell about 9% to $154.2 million, or $3.28 a fully diluted share, from $168.7 million, or $3.86 a fully diluted share.    &quot;Even a one-time loss of around $25 million in the fourth quarter would still leave us with net earnings for 1987 in the range of $125 million to $130 million, which would be the second-highest in Columbia's history,&quot; Mr. Spiegel said.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, the thrift's shares closed at $7.50, down 37.5 cents.    Columbia also said the recent decline in interest rates boosted the value of its fixed-income portfolio, which includes $3.7 billion of mortgage-backed securities, plus Treasury securities and junk bonds. Columbia could sell some of those securities in the remaining two months of the fourth quarter to generate gains to offset the losses in its stock portfolio.    Because of Columbia's accounting practices, any drop in the market prices of stocks it holds will be deducted from its earnings, even if the stocks aren't sold at the lower prices. However, any increase in stock prices isn't added to its earnings.    The accounting treatment for fixed-income securities and most preferred stocks is different, however. Gains or losses on those securities aren't booked unless the securities are sold, thereby realizing the gain or loss.    David A. Sachs, a senior vice president in charge of Columbia's investment department, said in an interview that the stock portfolio is based on &quot;a value-investing approach. We're not traders.&quot;    Mr. Sachs denied reports by some stock traders that Columbia's stock portfolio is mainly composed of takeover-related issues. &quot;Our portfolio doesn't include any situations that were risk-arbitrage or takeover investing,&quot; Mr. Sachs said. Columbia doesn't disclose the specific stocks it owns.    During the third quarter, Columbia's total assets increased 24% to $12.86 billion, largely because of a $2 billion increase in its mortgage-backed securities portfolio and a $246 million increase in its investment-securities portfolio, which includes junk bonds, Treasury bonds and stocks. Assets were $10.39 billion at June 30 and $10.22 billion at Dec. 31, 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
