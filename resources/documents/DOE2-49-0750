The systemsstudied are: 1) Co(II) and Cr(VI); 2) Co(II), Ni(II), and Cr(VI); 3)Cr(VI), Cu(II), and Zn(II); 4) Cr(VI), Cu(II), Zn(II), and Ni(II); 5)Cd(II), Pd(II), and Cu(II). Ferric hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide wereused as the coprecipitant, and sodium lauryl sulfate was used as thecollector and frother. The ionic strength of the solution was adjustedwith NaNO{sub 3} or Na{sub 2}SO{sub 4}. It was found that all the heavymetals can be removed effectively by a single step foam flotation treatment.</TEXT></DOC>
