If Ollie North can go run a private war with the applauseof the administration, why are they getting in the way of a fewcattlemen who want to make a sale to our very best customers?''   Ella Krucoff, spokeswoman for Sir Roy Denman, head of EECdelegation in Washington, said the EEC was in ``active contact withthe state of Texas. We are interested in maintaining the trade; wewant that trade to be in hormone-free meat.''   The European Economic Community has banned imports of U.S. beefand beef products because the meat, worth about $100 million insales, contains growth hormones that the EEC contends are a healththreat. The United States disputes those claims and retaliated bysetting about $100 million worth of higher tariffs on various CommonMarket products.   Ms. Krucoff said the EEC would be willing to accept certificationof the meat's purity from Texas authorities if the federalgovernment is not willing to certify the meat as hormone-free.   Hightower said the Texas agency has asked acting AgricultureSecretary Peter Myers to accept a provision with the EEC to certifybeef from Texas and other states for export, but ``we've had nocommunication back.''   The U.S. trade representative's office contends there is no wayTexas can verify the meat as hormone-free, thus effectivelyprohibiting its export.</TEXT></DOC>
