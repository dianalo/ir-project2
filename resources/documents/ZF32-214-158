 Some reasons why things are looking good forpayphone players:andM;1.andP;  Better Phones.andP;  Microprocessor-based smart phones are replacing many ofthe dumb ones.andP;  They provide a lot more customer services and thus are havinga profound effect on revenues.andM;It's estimated that 50% of all payphones will be upgraded from stupid, oldboxes to intelligent, sexy ones by the end of 1993.andP;  Don't laugh.andO;Competition is actually forcing the upgrades.andP;  Guess competition isn't so badafter all, is it, Mr. Phone Company?andM;2.andP;  The Shifting Tides of Unfair Practices.andP;  Don't get us wrong.andP;  Payphonepeople Eve in &quot;a very, very regulated world,&quot; as Walter Goff of TelcoIntercontinental stressed to us.andP;  And where there's considerable regulation,there's bound to be gripes from competitors, especially if one of the playersenjoyed a monopoly not too long ago.andM;Thus, many private COCOT providers are still complaining that they're gettinga raw deal in the regulatory decision making, including being charged extrafees and tariffs that telco-serviced payphones are not held responsible for.andM;Although the situation is a far cry from the times when all 0+ calls wereautomatically defaulted to the telephone company (operator-assisted calls, ofcourse, mean money), privately owned payphone providers must still buy theirdialtone from their competitors.andP;  There will always be problems, especiallywhen you throw in other long distance carriers and independent AOS companiesinto the mix.andM;For example, ATandamp;T is in the process of suing over 20 private COCOTs aroundthe country, holding them accountable for phone bills amounting to thousandsof dollars.andP;  The COCOTs, meanwhile, are saying the calls were placedfraudulently.andP;  They're blaming the local telcos, because they didn't providethem with a proper way of policing their networks.andP;  Whatever.andP;  It's quite asticky financial triangle that entangles these LD carriers, AOS companies,COCOTs and LECs.andM;All in all, however, things seem to be getting better regarding the equalityof the market.andP;  Recent regulatory decisions (and pending ones) suggest thatthe score is growing increasingly even.andM;For instance, acknowledging an unfair market, the California PUC ruled thatlocal telephone companies must reduce the tariffs to COCOT operators by $2,reduce charges for directory assistance and pay competitive operators 10cents per non-sent-paid intraLATA call directed through their network.andM;In addition, local carriers will offer competitive operators a few of theservices they provide for their own payphones, such as answer supervision,call scanning/rating and an end to the fraud-prone secondary dialtones.andO;Granted, this may be an example of one rather progressive state, but it couldmean the beginning of a shakedown in the industry.andM;Furthermore, there's a petition currently pending at the FCC (for quite sometime, actually) to classify payphones as customer premise equipment (CPE),like PBXs, unbundled from transmission service.andP;  If adopted, the proposalwould require LECs to make COCOT payphone access-lines available with thesame features that are currently only available with telco payphones.andP;  What'smore, telcos would have to charge both entities the same rate.andP;  Imagine that.andM;3.andP;  Improved  Customer Service.andP;  In the past, many of these companies havehad little incentive to explore the technological possibilities in thepayphone industry, but because of the large number of companies competingthere have been many advancements.andP;  Things like various methods ofcredit-card calling, public fax, store-and-forward voice messaging, voicesynthesis, speed dialing and even data ports for laptop computers.andM;4.andP;  Better Suited to Combat Vandalism.andP;  Phones are enclosed in galvanizedstainless steel.andP;  Handsets are armored.andP;  Components are covered with layersof durable materials that stand up to manmade weather and fire abuse.andM;&quot;A thief will destroy $500 worth of telephone components to get $25 inchange,&quot; notes Frank Zimmerer, president of the telecom and services divisionof Phillips andamp; Brooks.andP;  They even developed a special anti-vandalism kitcalled juicy name - the Gorilla Telephone Conversion Fit.andM;COCOTs, in fact, are leading the way in this kind of safeguarding because, inmany cases, they have been forced to go where telcos are afraid, setting uppayphones in high risk areas where payphones have repeatedly been defaced andvandalized and which cowardly telcos have long since abandoned.andM;Those crazy COCOTs.andP;  They actually try to go that extra mile (because oftheir competition, they have to).andP;  Now if only their &quot;competitors&quot; wouldfollow suit.andM;PAYPHONE VOICE RECOGNITIONandM;IntelliCall is always the cutting-edge leader of payphone technology as faras we're concerned.andM;Their VoiceRec employs speaker-independent  voice recognition technology thatworks ever so nicely with their high-tech IntelliStar automated operatortechnology.andP;  It lets anyone accept or reject an automated collect call simplyby replying yes or no (who would have thought it possible?).andP;  Not only doesit make it easier for the person called to deal with collect calls andautomated operators, but, for the first time, it lets people with rotaryphones play too.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
