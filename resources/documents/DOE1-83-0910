Describes investigations of tar and benzo(a)pyrene concentrationsin air in a carbon electrode manufacturing plant. Air samples were collectedusing the Staplex HV Model TFIA apparatus. Permissible concentrationfor tar substances is 0.2 mg/m{sup 3} and for benzo(a)pyrene 0.15 {mu}g/m{sup3} according to USA and Soviet standards (50 {mu}g/m{sup 3} for benzo(a)pyrenein protected areas according to Polish standards). Mean concentrationswere found to exceed the highest permissible concentrations by threetimes at the center of the plant and by two times 1,000 m from the boundaryof the plant. Concentrations of the two substances measured at differentworking places in the plant are given in tables and meauring methodsare described. Concludes that fume suction hoods and emission absorbinginstallations are needed to reduce concentrations at work places andto protect the plant environment. 3 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
