StevensStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/23/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP CANDA FREST JAPANPRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX) </IN><TEXT>   The dollar eased in sparse trading yesterday, but it appeared likely that the unit would get a boost today after the major industrial nations reaffirmed their desire to see the U.S. currency stabilize at or above current levels.    In Tokyo Wednesday, after the statement was released, the dollar was holding steady at 126.30 yen with the Bank of Japan reportedly intervening to support the U.S. currency. Earlier Wednesday, the dollar had traded at 126.68 yen.    Before last night's announcement by the Group of Seven nations, many currency traders had speculated that the group would voice only mild support for the dollar.    Some type of discussion or action by finance officials from the nations -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- had been widely expected after the U.S. Congress completed action on a plan to cut the budget deficit. Yesterday, President Reagan signed into law a measure to trim the deficit by more than $33 billion in the current fiscal year, which ends next Sept. 30.    &quot;The reason (traders) have sold the dollar off is the anticipation that it's going to be a very weak statement,&quot; Charles A. Spence, vice president, foreign exchange, at First Interstate Bank of California, Los Angeles, said. Mr. Spence was speaking late in the afternoon, before the statement was released.    In fact, the seven nations' finance ministers and central bank governors in effect established a new officially supported target range for the dollar, with the bottom of the range at or near current levels. The exact range wasn't spelled out.    Recent experience suggests, nevertheless, that the Group of Seven may find it difficult to prop up the dollar in the face of a concerted onslaught by currency traders.    In February, six members of the G-7 reached the Louvre agreement in Paris, calling on them to take measures to maintain stable exchange rates. The dollar was broadly stable for the next eight months, but it then skidded in the wake of the Oct. 19 stock market crash.    John J. McCarthy, vice president, foreign exchange, at Irving Trust Co., New York, said yesterday, before the latest Group of Seven statement became known: &quot;We've already had a go at demolishing the Louvre accord. The markets have attacked the whole concept of the Louvre accord because of its problems in the past.&quot;    He and other traders have said the accord was partly responsible for the increased volatility of world bond and stock markets this year. With exchange rates being broadly managed by major central banks, they said, bond and stock prices had to take up the burden of reflecting the differences among world economies that normally are expressed in exchange-rate movements.    Mr. McCarthy said foreign-exchange dealers are unlikely to accept central bankers' views of what currency rates should be now.    &quot;If someone tells you a Cadillac is worth more than a Mercedes, you might believe them once,&quot; he said. But just as West German cars are prized by many U.S. consumers, he suggested, so is the West German mark currently more coveted by foreign-exchange dealers.    Also speaking before the G-7 statement, Mr. Spence said he had picked up a different signal from Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita. At a news conference in Tokyo yesterday, Mr. Sumita hinted at a pullback from this year's strategy of intervention to support the dollar, saying, &quot;Currency stability cannot be achieved only through market intervention.&quot;    Mr. Spence said it almost sounded as if Mr. Sumita had &quot;given in to the market&quot; on that point.    The dollar has fallen 18% against the Japanese yen since the Louvre accord was announced, despite central bank intervention estimated at $100 billion to support the dollar against the yen and other major currencies.    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 126.37 yen, off slightly from 126.56 late Monday. The dollar also inched down to 1.6275 West German marks from 1.6280.    The seven-nation statement comes during one of the slowest periods of the year for foreign exchange trading. Many participants in the interbank market close their books for the year and stop trading in mid-December. That leaves the markets so thin that exchange-rate moves can be exaggerated by news developments or by transactions that are small by ordinary market standards.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $4.30 an ounce to $483.90 in light trading. Estimated volume was 1.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $484.85 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.    ---                     Late New York Trading                    Tuesday, Dec. 22, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
