WOMAN ACCUSED OF RUNNING HIGH-TECHHOOKER RING  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     But, Cavallaro said, there are striking similarities -- and cleverdifferences -- between the escort services operated by Hararah and Sam Ferris,who is serving a five-year sentence in prison.;    Ferris called his operationNude Escorts. Hararah named hers Bare Escorts.;    To protect himself, Ferrishad his employees sign waivers saying they would not engage in sex with theircustomers. Hararah did the same with most of her female escorts, police said.;   Also, Cavallaro said, to avoid the felony state employment law violationsthat entangled Ferris, Hararah had each woman get a city license as anindependent contractor who got calls through her. &quot;They put down theiroccupations as dancers, entertainers or escorts,&quot; Cavallaro said.;    Theescorts, police said, would strip for $140, perform a &quot;lewd act&quot; for $160 anddo both for $180.;    He and Vice Officer Adam Tovar spent five monthsinvestigating the firm, much of the time doing surveillance of her rentedhome-office on South Clover Avenue.;    The agency sent women to homes orhotel rooms, police said, ostensibly to give massages, perform exotic dancesor escort male clients. But, police said, the real business was to provideprostitutes.;    Police arrested two employees on suspicion of soliciting forprostitution.;    Vice officers plan to contact the male clients named in thecomputer or in Hararah's handwritten ledger.;    &quot;We want to interview themabout what happened at their meetings with the escorts,&quot; Cavallaro said, &quot;andthen we'll let the D.A. decide what to do with them.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BETTY BARNACLE, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910803  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  332  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday August 3, 199100216145,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
