Section 610.13 of the biologics regulations (21 CFR 610.13) provides requirementsfor assuring the purity of biological products, including, in andSection;610.13(a), a test for residual moisture in dried biological products. Certainbiological preparations are lyophilized to maintain the integrity, potency,and other properties of the product, when freezing alone or addition ofa preservative does not provide sufficient stability. Levels of residualmoisture in the freeze-dried product should be low so that the stabilityof the product is not compromised over time by degradation. The current requirement in andSection; 610.13(a)(1) prescribes specific proceduresfor testing residual moisture in dried biological products, and in andSection;610.13(a)(2) requires a moisture limit of no greater than 1 percent formost biological products. Several products, such as Measles Virus VaccineLive and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live, have higher moisture limits specifiedin the current regulations. For other products, product license applicationshave provided stability data in the form of product potency and residualmoisture to establish residual moisture limits higher than 1 percent throughoutthe product's dating period. The codified test procedure for determining moisture levels utilizes avacuum and phosphorus pentoxide at room temperature for 3 or more daysto remove residual moisture. This gravimetric, or loss-on-drying, methodrequires large sample sizes and is not capable of measuring all the waterof hydration and other types of bound water in the biological product whichnew technological methods can detect. Although the gravimetric method willmeasure some loosely bound water or hydration, this method most accuratelymeasures the surface moisture of the freeze-dried product, which is theoriginal definition of residual moisture. Newer methods can now serve as acceptable alternative testing to the gravimetricmethod for some products. For example, the coulometric Karl Fischer methodfor moisture determination detects smaller amounts of moisture than thegravimetric method and requires less sample for analysis. This procedureis particularly useful for analyzing the moisture content in freeze-driedproducts in single-dose vials that contain only a few milligrams of biologicalmaterial. In addition, the Karl Fischer method takes less time to performthan the gravimetric method. There are also other newer technologies fordetermining moisture content, for example, gas chromatographic methodsand thermogravimetric analysis which combines a mircobalance and heat todetermine moisture content. The thermogravimetric method can determinemoisture content in very small samples (i.e., 1 to 3 milligrams per vial).Because andSection; 610.13(a)(1) specifically requires use of the gravimetricmethod, these new technologies cannot be used for determining the residualmoisture of dried biological products without the submission of comparativedata under andSection; 610.9 <T3>Equivalent methods and processes. </T3>In addition, because these newtechnologies may detect increased levels of moisture, the 1.0 percent moisturelimit may not be appropriate for some products when tested by one of thenew methods. Accordingly, in concert with newer technology and more recent scientificknowledge, FDA is proposing to amend the test for residual moisture inandSection; 610.13 by providing more flexibility in the residual moisturetest requirements. The proposed changes would delete the specific testprocedures now in andSection; 610.13(a)(1) and, in andSection; 610.13(a)(2),remove the upper moisture limit of 1.0 percent, and the listed exceptions.Proposed andSection; 610.13(a)(1) would require each lot of dried productto be tested for residual moisture and other volatile substances, and tomeet and not exceed established limits as specifed by an approved methodon file in the product license application. Another proposed change inandSection; 610.13(a)(1) would allow the Director, Center for Biologics Evaluationand Research, to permit exemptions from this testing requirement when deemednot necessary for the continued safety, purity, and potency of the product.Manufacturers of dried products may at any time request an exemption fromthis testing requirement. However, manufacturers of these products mustcontinue to perform the test unless notified otherwise in writing by theDirector, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Proposed andSection;610.13(a)(2) also would require that records concerning the test for residualmoisture be maintained in accordance with applicable provisions of andSection;andSection;211.188 and 211.194 of the current good manufacturing practice regulationsfor finished pharmaceuticals (21 CFR Part 211). Elsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, FDA is announcing the availability of a draftguideline to interested persons that discusses test procedures, testingresults, and standards for determining residual moisture in freeze-driedproducts. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact </ITAG>The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(10) that this proposedaction is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significanteffect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessmentnor an environmental impact statement is required. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>Section 610.13(a)(2) of this proposed rule contains cross-references to21 CFR 211.188 and 21 CFR 211.194 which contain information collectionrequirements that were submitted for review and approval of the Director,Office of Management and Budget (OMB), as required by section 3507 of thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Those requirements were approved and assignedOMB control number 0910-0139. <ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Assessment </ITAG>The agency has examined the economic consequences of this proposed ruleand has determined that it does not require either a regulatory impactanalysis, as specified in Executive Order 12291, or a regulatory flexibilityanalysis, as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354).The proposed rule increases the flexibility of the testing requirementfor biological products in determining residual moisture content. The proposedchange also permits the Director, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research,to exempt manufacturers from this testing requirement. Therefore, the agencyhas determined that the proposed rule is not a major rule as defined inExecutive Order 12291. Further, FDA certifies that the proposed rule willnot have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities,as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments </ITAG>Interested persons may, on or before August 28, 1989, submit to the DocketsManagement Branch (address above) written comments regarding this proposal.Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individualsmay submit one copy.
