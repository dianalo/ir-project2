Minutes of the committee's March 31 meeting state that &quot;. . . a few members were of the view that the dollar sooner or later might need to decline somewhat further to correct the nation's trade imbalance -- and such a decline should be accepted if it occurred. . . .&quot; At the time, the dollar was trading at around 146.25 yen. In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 141.70 yen.    Most members &quot;expressed concern about the implications of continuing dollar depreciation under prevailing circumstances.&quot; Moreover, the committee tilted toward tightening monetary policy, although it unanimously voted to make no change in its credit stance. The minutes show that &quot;excessive weakness in the dollar (was) recognized as the potential development most likely to make&quot; a tightening appropriate.    Whether to tighten would also depend on credit-market conditions, inflation, the economy and the money supply.    In fact, the Fed did tighten credit slightly after the meeting. On April 30, Mr. Volcker disclosed that the Fed had been tightening slightly in recent days, an action he termed &quot;snugging.&quot; At the same time, Japan moved to raise its interest rates. Both actions were taken to stem the dollar's decline.    The minutes were released after the customary delay of six to eight weeks. The committee met again last Tuesday, but minutes of that meeting won't be released until July.    On the dollar, some members &quot;emphasized the desirability of relatively prompt, if limited, action&quot; to stem the dollar's drop. One member suggested the success of such a policy might be enhanced &quot;if the markets were alerted to any firming action.&quot;    Others preferred to move with &quot;relative caution,&quot; stressing the uncertain relationship between U.S. interest rates and the dollar's behavior, together with the risks to a &quot;possibly fragile economic expansion&quot; in the U.S. and around the world.    The members noted that the rebound in energy prices and the depreciation of the dollar were pushing up the inflation rate this year. Still, they expected price increases to be limited by continuing competition from abroad and the absence of capacity restraints in most industries. Also, they found that wage pressures had remained subdued.    The panel said its policy would be consistent with growth in the broader money-supply measures at annual rates of 6% or less from March through June.    The minutes also show that on April 22 and May 6, the panel acted to increase the limit on the Fed's holding of federal securities to accommodate a surge in tax revenue to the Treasury.    The vote on the panel's policy directive was 10-0. Normally, the panel consists of the Fed members and five of the 12 district reserve bank presidents. There are currently two vacancies on the Fed, although the nomination to the board of Edward Kelley, a Houston investment counselor, was approved by the Senate last week. </TEXT></DOC>
