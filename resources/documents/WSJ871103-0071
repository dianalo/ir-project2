For the past few years, corporate treasurers have &quot;captured&quot; income by trading in and out of high-yield stocks to take advantage of a low tax rate on dividends. The goal was to earn a healthy return on idle cash reserves with relatively little risk.    As much as $2 billion was invested this way earlier in 1987, and the strategy was gaining in popularity. Enough yield-seeking investors were using it that obscure utility stocks jumped to the most-active lists on stock exchanges.    But in last month's panicky markets, dividend-capture users discovered there was no safety. Hedging techniques with options and futures simply failed to guard against huge market drops, leading to losses in the values of portfolios. As a result, corporate treasurers who had been earning annually as much as 10% after taxes on dividend captures -- much more than from traditional short-term investments like Treasury bills -- faced big losses.    One of the hardest hit was Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc. Late last week, it announced it had lost $11.3 million in the stock market, almost all in dividend-capture programs. The treasurer of the unit responsible for the loss &quot;retired&quot; last week, according to the company. Paul Oyer, financial vice president and controller, added that the company had withdrawn all its money from the market.    The Honolulu-based utility's losses were unusually deep because the company bought on margin to increase its presence in the market. But a far more common problem for most dividend-capture programs, frequently used by cash-rich utilities, was that the hedges that had been designed to protect against heavy losses didn't work.    The result is that corporations -- which, unlike pension funds, might need their cash immediately -- are reassessing the risks of dividend-capture strategies. &quot;We're clearly re-examining our decisions with respect to these programs now,&quot; said Richard J. Osborne, treasurer of Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Power Co. The utility had $125 million of corporate cash in various dividend-capture strategies.    Mr. Osborne said 1987 returns from the company's overall portfolio will be about 1.5% lower than they would have been without its capture program. &quot;The world may have changed, and we have to look at these investments in that light.&quot;    Many of the 30 to 35 firms that offer dividend-capture programs say some corporate clients have become skittish. &quot;A very big private company was ready to give us everything,&quot; said Bruce H. Lipnick, president of New York-based Wharton Asset Management Corp., which offers several kinds of dividend-capture programs. &quot;We had been working with them for a year and they had finally approved us.&quot;    Unfortunately, Mr. Lipnick said, the company's board met last Monday, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 156.83 points. &quot;They said forget it,&quot; said Mr. Lipnick. &quot;People are so shell-shocked about everything that they just don't want to think about dividend capture.&quot;    At the heart of dividend-capture strategies is the low tax rate that corporations pay on dividend income. If a company owns a stock for at least 46 days and collects a dividend, 80% of the income is tax-free. The rationale is to protect companies that own large stakes in other concerns from double taxation. Otherwise, the holder would be taxed on its share of the other company's profit and then on dividends ultimately paid from that profit.    Turning this broad exemption to their advantage, aggressive money managers can turn over portfolios six or seven times a year. They bet that the stock price won't make any big moves as the dividends pour in, taxed at a very low rate. The goal is to double the after-tax return available from Treasury bills, with no more risk than a two-year Treasury note, says Hugh Lamle, executive vice president at M.D. Sass Investors Services. &quot;In a year like this, you'd be shooting for a 7% return after taxes,&quot; he says.    Although officials at several dividend-capture firms said they had heard many disaster stories involving the strategy, few would acknowledge that their own firms were hurt. One exception was New York based Paramount Capital Group Inc., which runs a popular dividend-capture strategy called buy-writes.    Simply put, in a buy-write, investors buy shares of common stock in a company that will pay a dividend within roughly 46 days and sell call options on that stock at the same time. A holder of the call has the right to buy the stock at a specified price for a given time. Income generated by the sale of such options reduces the investment outlay.    The buy-write strategy has worked very well in recent years as the market has climbed. But on Black Monday, when options trading became chaotic, the strategy fizzled. &quot;We did take a hit,&quot; said Bryan Ganz, chairman of Paramount. Mr. Ganz said that before the October drop, the firm was offering after-tax returns of about 8% annually. Now, he said, after-tax returns at the end of October would be roughly 4.5%.    Another firm that acknowledged difficulties with its dividend-capture programs was Capitoline Investment Services Inc., a unit of Crestar Financial Corp. in Richmond, Va. The firm said its portfolios will have after-tax losses of roughly 6% to 7% for the month of October.    &quot;Obviously, this is unsettling,&quot; said William J. Longan Jr., assistant vice president of Capitoline, &quot;because we're dealing with corporate cash that isn't supposed to be exposed to this kind of volatility.&quot;    The dilemma that Capitoline and other capture firms face is how much to hedge with futures and options, which cut into the portfolios' income. &quot;We don't stay fully hedged by design,&quot; said Frank C. Atkins, assistant vice president of Capitoline. &quot;We're running 80% to 90% hedged to capture the extra returns.    &quot;Will we do things differently in the future?&quot; Mr. Atkins asks. &quot;Sure. But we can't adjust the program to deal with 1929 or Oct. 19. The only way you can deal with those kinds of days is to be in Treasury bills.&quot;    Robert Gordon, president of Twenty-First Securities Corp. in New York, said his firm's dividend-capture programs &quot;skated through the past two weeks without any damage,&quot; because all its stocks are directly hedged. For example, Mr. Gordon wouldn't use utility stocks for his dividend-capture programs until a utility stock index began trading on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange in September.    Indirect hedges, like using interest rate futures to hedge interest-sensitive preferred stocks, have done poorly, Mr. Gordon said. &quot;Some firms owned the preferreds, which went down, and had sold short the interest-rate futures, which went up,&quot; he said. &quot;The hedge worked exactly wrong.&quot;    Mr. Lamle of M.D. Sass said the firm's $200 million in dividend-capture programs also suffered little erosion in the market collapse because the portfolios were well hedged. Some other managers, he said, tried to cut costs by not hedging and now are paying the price.    Timothy C. Ng and John G. Nardi, vice presidents at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., who match corporations with dividend-capture firms, said if the programs were designed and implemented correctly, portfolios should have stayed flat or moved down only slightly.    &quot;We've spoken to most of the people who did this, and even at the worst time, dividend-capture programs were down only 10%,&quot; said Mr. Nardi. But corporate treasurers probably now have a better notion how these strategies can misfire. &quot;If you didn't think you could lose money, boy, were you woken up,&quot; Mr. Ng said.    ---             Tough Test for Dividend Capture   Here's how one dividend capture program would fare if theposition was closed out Oct. 19, after the crash, or Jan. 15,1988 Sept. 30, 1987 Buy 10,000 shares of ATandamp;T at        Hedge the stock with $33.75 each                         calls and index puts Cost: $338,300 (with commissions) Oct. 19, 1987 (If investor closes out position) Sell 10,000 shares of ATandamp;T at $24 each          $240,000 Close out hedges                                $ 87,577 Net pretax loss                                 $ 10,722 Implied annual rate of return pretax            - 70.9% Implied annual rate of return after tax         - 42.5% Jan. 15, 1988 (If ATandamp;T stays at $24 and investor closes out position Jan. 15) Dividend (30 cents a share)                     $  3,000 Sell 10,000 shares of ATandamp;T at $24 each          $240,000 Close out hedges                                $100,077 Net gain                                        $  4,777 Annual rate of return pretax                       5.6% Annual rate of return after tax                    3.37% Source: Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.</TEXT></DOC>
