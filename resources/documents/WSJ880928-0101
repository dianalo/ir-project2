The action came as the Senate continued its election-year debate on parental-leave legislation. Even though the revision would practically exclude small businesses from the proposed requirements, it wasn't clear whether the compromise improved the bill's prospects. Critics continued to assail any government attempt to dictate benefits that companies must offer.    The measure would mandate allowing as much as 10 weeks' unpaid employee leave in any two-year period for childbirth, adoption or care for a seriously ill child. It also would grant employees as much as 10 weeks' medical leave in any one-year period.    Only companies with 50 or more employees would be covered by the modified measure, which originally covered all those with 20 or more employees. The new version also reduces the number of weeks allowed for medical leave from the original 13. The requirements still would cover about 40% of the work force but only about 5% of businesses.    The move, designed to deflate small-business opposition, shifts the projected impact of the measure to big business.    &quot;A smaller employer takes care of its employees,&quot; said Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), the bill's chief sponsor. &quot;The problem arises with the larger employer,&quot; whose employees' problems can get lost in the bureaucratic shuffle, he argued.    Small-business advocates, however, remained opposed to the bill.    &quot;Eventually, the intention is to get paid parental leave for everybody,&quot; said John Motley, director of federal government relations for the National Federation of Independent Business. &quot;It's obvious that what we're dealing with is the camel's nose {in the tent} strategy.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
