U.S. District Judge Jesse W. Curtis on Monday also placed ArthurAbba Goldberg on five years' probation, fined him $100,000 andordered him to repay the United States $300,000.   Goldberg, executive vice president of the New York bondunderwriting firm of Matthews andamp; Wright, pleaded guilty July 14 tothree counts of mail fraud.   He had been accused of funneling $70,000 to former Guam Gov.Ricardo J. Bordallo's unsuccessful 1986 re-election campaign. Inexchange, Bordallo allegedly agreed to generate support for a $300million housing bond issue underwritten by Matthews andamp; Wright.   Bordallo was acquitted in February 1986 of accepting bribes fromGoldberg but was convicted on 10 counts of government corruption.He served as governor from 1975-79 and from 1983-87.   Goldberg had faced a maximum 15 years' imprisonment and a$750,000 fine in addition to restitution payments, according toWilliam O'Connor, the U.S. attorney from Guam.   The three counts referred to money bilked from the Guam ProgramDevelopment Fund and a ``lulling letter'' assuring fund authoritiesthat the transactions were legal.   A December 1987 indictment charged Goldberg with preparing phonyinvoices that were sent to the bank entrusted with the fund money.   The bank paid the money to Goldberg, who spent $25,000 to buycampaign paraphernalia _ including parasols, shirts and hats _ forBordallo's unsuccessful re-election bid, O'Connor has said.   Authorities said Goldberg made his contributions after Bordallowas promised that he would receive campaign contributions if hesupported the bond issue to build homes. The bond was approved bythe Guam Legislature in 1985. Matthews andamp; Wright has denied anywrongdoing.   In exchange for Goldberg's guilty pleas, 46 other countsalleging bribery, conspiracy, and wire and mail fraud weredismissed. The case was moved from Guam, 3,800 miles west ofHawaii, because of extensive pretrial publicity on the island.   Twelve of the original counts against Goldberg were relateddirectly to Guam. The balance referred to fraud involving the useof the Commercial Bank of Americas in transactions that did notinvolve the U.S. territory.   In August 1987, Gov. Joseph Ada sued Matthews andamp; Wright for thereturn of $14 million in fees the firm had received, as well as$250 million in punitive damages. O'Connor said in July the suithad been settled, but he released no details.</TEXT></DOC>
