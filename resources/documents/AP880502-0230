The prospect that Bucaram, leader of the populist RoldosistaParty, could win the presidential runoff election Sunday hasstirred rumors of a military coup and sent tremors throughEcuador's financial circles.   The military sent him fleeing into exile once before.   His foes accuse him of appealing to class hatred in hisspeeches. But Bucaram's response is that he is a champion of thepoor.   Campaigning recently in Guayaquil's steamy heat with his shirttail hanging out, he called himself a ``good-hearted slob'' andadmits he may be a bit ``crazy.''   But his opponent in the election, Rodrigo Borja, is takingBucaram's challenge seriously.   Political analysts say Bucaram has a good chance of defeatingBorja, a Social Democrat and leader of the Democratic Left party,in the runoff.   In the first round Jan. 31, the 36-year-old Bucaram won secondplace in a field of 10 candidates with 15.3 percent of the vote to20.3 percent for the 52-year-old Borja, 52.   The winner Sunday will replace Leon Febres Cordero, a staunchlyconservative, pro-U.S. political leader whose four-year term endsin August.   This nation of 10 million people, wedged between Colombia andPeru, has suffered in recent years from severe economic problemsand political instability sparked in great part by bitter disputesbetween Febres Cordero and left-leaning parties that controlCongress.   Borja, who narrowly lost to Febres Cordero in a runoff in 1984,has pledged to reverse the current government's free-marketeconomic policies and seek close ties with the Non-AlignedMovement, also known as the Third World.   Borja's party is Ecuador's largest, but his chances areweakened, many analysts say, because he is viewed as a lacklusterspeaker without strong leadership ability.   Bucaram, who wears a Hitler-style mustache and says he is anadmirer of the Nazi leader's ``organizational genius,'' charged atone point in the campaign that ``an international Jewishconspiracy'' was against him.   Catholic Church leaders and newspapers have assailed Bucaram forhis use of gutter-language in attacks on Borja. Bucaram has calledBorja a drunkard and drug addict in television interviews. He alsohas used unprintable street language to question his foe's virility.   ``Borja lacks strength, spirit,'' Bucaram said. ``He's alukewarm man. Abdala is different,'' he said of himself. ``Heawakens passions. There is no middle ground with him.''   The attacks have prompted Borja, a calm, urbane lawyer, torespond in kind, calling Bucaram an ``irresponsible clown'' and a``fascist ignoramus.''   ``I have been accused of everything in my political career fromnarcotics trafficker to thief,'' Bucaram said in a midnightinterview outside his small third-floor walkup apartment on agarbage-littered downtown street.   Bucaram has pledged to ``punish the oligarchy'' and crack downon wealthy tax evaders who, he charges, cheat the government of upto $500 million a year.   ``A vote for me is the same as scratching a Mercedes Benz with abottle cap,'' he told a cheering slum crowd, alluding to such anact as defiance of the rich.   He has promised a ``shoe bank'' to provide free shoes for allpoor children and has pledged to nearly double the monthly minimumwage to $60.   His foes call him a demagogue for making such promises butacknowledge privately that Bucaram is following in Ecuador'stradition of populist leaders.   The late Jose Maria Velasco Ibarra won the presidency fivetimes, in good measure because of his inflammatory populistrhetoric. He also was ousted four times in military coups.   Bucaram was mayor of this city of 1.5 million people when hefled into exile in late 1985 to escape prison on a charge ofslandering the armed forces, a criminal offense in Ecuador. He hadsaid all the military was good for was wasting money on parades.   In Panama he was arrested on a charge of possessing five poundsof cocaine. He claimed it was a frame-up arranged by FebresCordero, a political enemy.   Ecuador's Congress granted him amnesty on the military offenseand pressured Panama into dropping the cocaine charge.   He returned in August 1987 to a hero's welcome from hisfollowers in Guayaquil's shantytowns.   Bucaram is heir to a political dynasty of Lebanese immigrantswho settled in Guayaquil, Ecuador's biggest city and its commercialhub. His sister, Elsa, was elected mayor of Guayaquil in thegeneral elections this past January.   Even political foes say Bucaram was successful in administeringGuayaquil, a tough port city that has proved unmanageable for manymayors.   He won over hundreds of thousands of slum dwellers by pavingstreets, piping in drinking water and providing other essentialservices.   He cracked down on street crime and kept the city clean byjailing anyone who let garbage pile up in front of his property.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Friday AMs, May 6</NOTE></DOC>
