The suits against Toys R Us and six other companies charge thatthe toys are unsafe because they contain excessive amounts of leadpaint or have small parts that could choke small children.   The agencies said they were unaware of any injuries or deathsresulting from the toys, some of which were seized from storeshelves by government investigators.   In a statement, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh called thelawsuits ``an important step toward preventing even a singledangerous toy from reaching innocent children.''   However, Michael Goldstein, executive vice president of Toys RUs, said ``the suit is without merit. Our safety record isexcellent.   ``We believe we will prevail in the legal action and we believeit's a waste of the taxpayers' money,'' said Goldstein, who wasnamed as a defendant in the suit against Toys R Us.   The lawsuits seek injunctions barring the companies fromimporting or selling the toys that contain too much lead paint orare considered unsafe for children under age three.   The lawsuits described a variety of rattles and toy airplanes orstuffed animals that violated the safety regulations. Many of thetoys cited were labeled for use by children over age three, but theCPSC contended in court papers that the items were, in fact,intended to be used by small children who could choke on smallparts.   CPSC spokesman Dan Rumelt said the toys were mostly importedfrom Taiwan but also were made in Hong Kong, China and South Korea.   Besides Toys R Us, which is headquartered in Paramus, N.J., thegovernment also sued Child World Inc., of Avon, Mass.; LionelLeisure Inc., of Philadelphia; Value Merchants Inc. of Milwaukee;Illco Toy Company, USA, Inc., of New York; BeachcombersInternational Inc. of Fort Meyers, Fla.; and Division Sales Inc. ofItasca, Ill. Chief executives of the companies were also named asdefendants in the civil suits.   The complaints also named the chief executives of the companiesas defendants in the civil suits. The court papers said each of thecompanies had been previously notified that the toys violatedsafety regulations.   Some of the toys have been recalled by distributors, the CPSCsaid.   A woman who answered the telephone at Lionel Leisure declined tocomment, saying she was unaware of the lawsuit.   ``Until we receive legal service, as far as we're concerned wehaven't been sued by anybody,'' said the woman, who refused toidentify herself.   An official of Division Sales, who also refused to identifyhimself, declined to comment, saying he ``didn't know anythingabout it.''   Mike Mervis, a spokesman for Value Merchants, said the companyhad recalled all nine items CPSC cited as unsafe. Value Merchantspurchased the items thinking they met government standards but``the product bought and the product that was shipped may have beendifferent things,'' he said.   Value Merchants is continuing to negotiate with the governmentto reach a consent decree to settle the case, Mervis said. But thespokesman blamed inadequate inspection of foreign goods by the U.S.Customs Service for the recurring problem.   ``There is no foolproof way to control this without muchstronger federal intervention and some means of controlling theinspection process'' in factories overseas, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
