Still, the centralbank's major manufacturers index -- the percentage of repliesthat conditions are good minus those weighing in as bad --declined to 39 from 42 in the previous survey, the sixth dropin a row.   A bank official said the results show no big change inbusiness sentiment, but he wouldn't say whether thisindicates a slowdown in Japan's economy, which has beenexpanding for 51 months.   An easing of oil price pressures caused businessexpectations on prices to improve markedly. But upward pricepressures, owing to tightness in the labor and goods markets,remain a big concern. Major manufacturers expect corporatesales to grow 9.1% in the current fiscal year but only 3.7%next year.   Capital investment in the coming fiscal year is forecastto decline 1.1% from the current year, when 16.9% growth isexpected. This would be the first annual decline since 1987.                                                                                                          AUSTRALIA AND VIETNAM SIGN PACT                                                                                                          Australia and Vietnam signed an investment protectionagreement in Canberra at the inaugural meeting of theAustralia-Vietnam Joint Trade and Economic Committee. Itstipulates that neither country will take over investmentsexcept in the public interest, provides for compensation wheninvestments are nationalized, and sets up procedures forsettling commercial disputes. Bilateral trade grew to 100million Australian dollars (US$77.7 million) in 1989 from A$6million in 1984.                                                                                                          EC AID CLEARS HURDLE                                                                                                          The European Community will give the Soviet Union 250million European currency units ($333.3 million) in emergencyfood aid, following agreement on how to fund the plan.Details were completed for 100 million ECUs in emergency foodand medical aid for Bulgaria and Romania. The EC also movedto curb farm fraud, which costs the 12-nation bloc billionsof dollars in losses annually.                                                                                                          LAST CRUISE MISSILES LEAVE U.K.                                                                                                          The last 16 nuclear cruise missiles in Britain were flownout to be destroyed in the U.S. under a U.S.-Soviet armsreduction treaty. The missiles, 96 in all, had been deployedat Greenham Common, an air base west of London and the sceneof big anti-nuclear protests after they arrived in 1983. Awomen-only &quot;peace camp&quot; has been maintained around the base.The missiles are to be dismantled in Arizona under a Maydeadline in the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty.                                                                                                          GERMANY'S OUTLAYS TO MUSHROOM                                                                                                          Bonn plans spending of 412 billion marks ($268.8 million)this year, about 12 billion marks more than previouslyannounced, because of the costs of rebuilding easternGermany. Parliament will discuss the additional outlays nextweek. Germany last month presented budget expenditures of399.7 billion marks, up 5.3% from 1990. The added spendingwon't be covered by Bonn's planned increase in certain taxes.                                                                                                          CHINA LEASES SATELLITE SPACE                                                                                                          Asia Satellite Telecommunications Co. said China leased atransponder on the AsiaSat 1 satellite for three years for atotal of $4.5 million. Beijing will start using the equipmentto relay voice and data services throughout China in May.AsiaSat is a joint venture of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., HongKong Telecommunications Ltd. and China International Trust andamp;Investment Corp. The satellite, launched last April, servestelecommunications authorities of Burma, Mongolia andPakistan, and Hutchison's HutchVision unit, which plans tostart pan-Asian television broadcasting this year.                                                                                                          PROFIT PLUNGE FOR RENAULT?                                                                                                          Renault's 1990 profit fell to two billion francs ($383.1million) from 1989's record 9.29 billion francs, news reportsin France said. The results would be well below the threebillion francs to 3.5 billion francs that Renault forecast inOctober. The French state-owned auto maker declined tocomment.                                                                                                          OECD'S TOURISM GROWTH SLOWS                                                                                                          Tourism receipts last year rose 5% in real terms for the24 member countries of the Organization For EconomicCooperation and Development, slowing from a 6.1% real rise in1989. The figures, which adjust for exchange-ratefluctuations and inflation, also showed tourism revenue inEurope rose 3% last year, compared with 8% for non-EuropeanOECD countries.   The outlook for this year is uncertain, because of anylong-term effects of the Persian Gulf war. Data for early1991 show hotels in some countries and major airlines werehurt, but the war's end may signal improvements.   The tourism data show marked increases for Denmark, at18.6%; Italy, 12.6%, and Britain, 7.1%, and significantdeclines for Yugoslavia, at 68%; Spain, 14.4%; and Sweden,4.7%.

Taxes in Japan were evaded on profits totaling 965.7billion yen ($7.1 billion) from sales of land, houses andother personal assets in 1989, a Japanese news agency said.The total was the second largest ever, after the 1.26trillion yen in 1988. . . . Denmark is ready to sign a pactwith Sweden to build a rail and road link across the11-mile-wide Oeresund strait, which separates the twocountries.</TEXT></DOC>
