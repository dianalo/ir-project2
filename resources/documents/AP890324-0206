The spree of corporate takeover maneuvering sounded like afinancial clone of college basketball's March Madness and was aboutthe only thing that captivated Wall Street's attention this pastweek _ besides brokers' bets on the nationally televised NCAAtournament.   One notable element of the latest merger deals was theirstaccato pace. Three were announced the same day, resurrectingmemories of the frenzy of huge deals that had become almost routinein the past few years but _ until now _ seemed to have waned in1989.   Stock speculators and others who follow buyouts said the rash ofannouncements was more than coincidence.   For one thing, more than five months have elapsed since thegranddaddy $24.53 billion RJR Nabisco Inc. takeover brawl, whichchilled many other deals, rumored and real.   That megadeal raised fears that Congress would crack down on oneof investment banking's most lucrative businesses, partly becauseof the enormous amount of debt used to finance many mergers andbecause of questions over how it could be repaid.   The RJR deal now has been digested, with little outwardlydramatic impact. In addition, Washington lawmakers appear unwillingor unable to more tightly regulate or constrict takeovers.   Moreover, rising interest rates appear to be playing a role byconvincing some takeover investors to make their move now beforethe cost of credit gets too expensive.   But perhaps the most significant takeover news of the week wasthe evident success of an antitakeover strategy.   Instant camera giant Polaroid Corp., hounded for months by theShamrock Holdings Inc. investment concern, won a court battleupholding the legitimacy of a stock repurchase that seemed tosquelch Shamrock's $3.2 billion bid. Shamrock declined to admitdefeat but planned to sell its Polaroid stock.   In another successful escape, chemical concern Pennwalt Corp.embraced a friendly $1.05 billion acquisition by France's SocieteNationale Elf Aquitaine, foiling an unwanted takeover by theCentaur Partners investment concern.   Centaur dropped its bid but still walks away with big profits, ademonstration that even in failure in the takeover business there'ssuccess: it paid about $60-a-share for a stake in Pennwalt and cansell out to Elf Aquitaine for $132 a share.   A third corporate rescue concerned Emhart Corp., target of anunwanted takeover threat from the investment partnership TopperL.P. Toolmaker Black andamp; Decker Corp. agreed to buy Emhart for $2.8billion, but Topper sought to stop the deal in court.   Elsewhere, billionaire takeover investor Ronald Perelman decidedto add camping gear to his collection of perfume, licorice extractand savings and loan businesses. Wichita, Kan.-based Coleman Co.accepted a $545 million buyout offer from MacAndrews andamp; ForbesHoldings Inc., which is controlled by Perelman, and spurned a rivalmanagement-led offer.   Another savvy takeover strategist, Donald Kelly, teamed withSalomon Inc. to acquire plastics maker Envirodyne Industries Inc.for $736 million. It marked Kelly's first takeover foray since hehelped investment concern Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. acquireBeatrice Cos. three years ago.   In the rumor realm, word leaked that billionaire investor RobertBass had purchased stock in Time Inc. with the possible aim ofbuying the publishing giant. Stock in Time, which earlier thismonth agreed to merge with Warner Communications partly as anantitakeover move, soared on the Bass story.   Finally, one friendly deal turned sour.   Manhattan developer Donald Trump demanded at least a third offthe $365 million price he had agreed to pay for the EasternAirlines shuttle because the carrier has since been crippled by astrike and has sought refuge in bankruptcy court. In response,Eastern made the shuttle available to all bidders.   In other business and economic news this past week:   _A jury convicted an assistant bond trader at Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc. of perjury and other charges, making her the firstemployee of the securities firm to be found guilty as a result of amassive federal fraud inquiry. Another jury deadlocked indeliberating stock manipulation charges against GAF Corp. and a topcompany officer, resulting in the second mistrial in that case.   _One week after news about inflation frightened the financialmarkets, new evidence emerged that the economy is slowing. Thegovernment said durable goods orders fell in February, the secondstraight monthly drop, consumer prices rose only moderately andmore Americans diverted their income into savings. The Big Threeautomakers, meanwhile, reported soft sales for mid-March.   _The House passed a minimum wage bill, raising the prospect of a$1.10-an-hour rise in compensation for the nation's lowest paidworkers. The passage came during the same week a House panelreleased report that showed a widening gap between rich and poorfrom 1973 through 1987.</TEXT><NOTE>End advance for weekend editions March 25-26.</NOTE></DOC>
