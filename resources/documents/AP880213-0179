Also Saturday, Palestinian refugees set fires and blocked roadsto protest the kidnappings, which the U.N. relief agency blamed onPalestinian individuals acting without a political motive.   In other developments, a Beirut newspaper printed a valentinefrom the heartsick family of an American hostage and receivedhundreds of other cards supporting other foreigners held hostage inLebanon. Also, a Christian militia freed eight men and a15-year-old boy taken seven weeks ago from a Danish ship it claimedcarried arms for a Druse militia.   The handwritten note in Arabic, left at a Western news agencyoffice in Beirut, was the first claim of responsibility since JanStening, 44, and William Jorgensen, 58, were abducted by gunmen onthe outskirts of Lebanon's southern port city of Sidon Feb. 5.   ``The abduction ... was not a stupid or silly action,'' the notesaid. ``It was carried out for security purposes. They will beinterrogated in light of the information in our possession.''   ``If their innocence is established they will be set free withina maximum period of one week,'' it added.   It was not clear what the reference to ``innocence'' meant,since the note did not make any specific accusations against thetwo men.   The note did not identify the kidnappers. But it carried thealleged signatures and thumbprints of the two captives.   An official at the Lebanon headqarters of the U.N. Relief andWorks Agency in Beirut, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidthe signatures appeared to be authentic.   Earlier Saturday, Palestinians in five south Lebanon refugeecompounds burned tires and closed roads to their camps to showanger over the abductions.   A general strike called by Palestinians upset with theabductions closed schools and shops in refugee camps in Sidon andTyre.   The U.N. relief organization removed four other foreign staffersfrom Lebanon after the abductions. The evacuations apparentlysparked fears among the Palestinians that agency might suspendservices that cover 270,000 refugees in Lebanon if the twoScandinavians were not released.   In an interview published Saturday in the daily Al-Ahramnewspaper in Cairo, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat was quoted as sayingthat his forces have surrounded the hideout of the kidnappers, butthat the Swedish and Norwegian governments requested that it not bestormed.   In Beirut, the leftist daily As-Safir on Saturday published apicture of the family of American hostage Thomas Sutherland, alongwith a Valentine's Day message.   The message read: ``To Tom Sutherland. A Christmas picture withValentine love, loyalty, strength, perseverance, and steadfast hopeand faith.''   The photo was signed by Sutherland's wife, Jean, and othermembers of the family in Fort Collins, Colo. Mrs. Sutherland, threeother women, a man and a child appeared in the picture.   Sutherland, acting dean of agriculture at the AmericanUniversity of Beirut, was kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut June 9,1985. The group Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, has claimed hisabduction.   The group, believed made up of radical Shiite Moslems loyal toIran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, also claims it holds Americanjournalist Terry A. Anderson.   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, was kidnapped March 16, 1985, and is the longest-heldforeign hostage in Lebanon.   Sateh Noureddine, an editor at As-Safir, said that hundreds ofletters of support for the hostages had arrived at his office andhe would ``try to publish some of them,'' the Rochester (N.Y.)Democrat andamp; Chronicle reported in its Sunday editions.   Former hostage David Jacobsen, who was released Nov. 2, 1986after 17 months in captivity, had suggested that valentines be sentto the newspaper and the State Department for the hostages.   In all, eight Americans and 16 other foreigners are missing andbelieved kidnapped in Lebanon since 1985.   Captivity ended Saturday for eight seaman and a 15-year-old boy,who boarded a ferry Saturday for Cyprus after seven weeks ofcaptivity in Lebanon. They included three Poles, three Danes, twoSri Lankans and a Trinidadian.   ``They have all been released,'' said Ole Neustrup, Danishcharge d'affaires in Damascus, Syria, who took charge of the Danesafter they were freed by the Lebanese Forces militia.   Neustrup would not release the names of those freed.   The Danish captain, two Danish officers, the crewmen and the boywere taken prisoner Dec. 27 after their vessel, the Ingawebb,arrived from North Yemen with a cargo of food, said Herluf Hansen,a Danish Foreign Ministry spokesman in Copenhagen.   The Christian militia accused the crew of unloading arms forDruse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party militiaat its port south of Beirut before sailing into the city's harbor,news reports said.   The party is the main foe of the Christians in Lebanon's nearly13-year-old civil war.</TEXT></DOC>
