Radiummass determination limit and the lower boundary of the mass determinedconstituted 2.3 x 10/sup -16/ and 7.3 x 10/sup -16/ g respectively forfour measurements of sample and background. Under the conditions whenthe sample mass is 500 g radium content of 4.8 x 10/sup -19/ g/g canbe determined in the determination limit with relative standard deviation0.33. On the lower boundary of radium mass determined the relative errorof measurement equals 0.16 at fiducial proability 0.9. The content ofradium - 226 in tetraethyllead, tripropylaluminium, diethylmercury, commercial- grade mercury and mercury produced from diethylmercury is measured.</TEXT></DOC>
