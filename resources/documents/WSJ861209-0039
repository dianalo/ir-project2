The property-casualty insurer, historically a poor performer, has often been on the block. Its former parent, City Investing, tried to sell it for many months before throwing in the towel. In 1985, Home was spun off as part of City's liquidation plan.    Recently, talk has resurfaced that Home's managers may still want to sell the company. The big question is whether there really is a buyer for Home, and at what price.    In recent weeks, Home shares have been trading in what money managers call a classic pattern of accumulation. Available shares have been snapped up at rising prices and the stock has retreated only on low volumes. Yesterday, Home closed at 21, off 1/4, in sparse trading.    The stock is up from only 17 3/8 about three weeks ago, when there was a bout of selling. The rumored seller was Ivan Boesky's arbitrage fund, which began liquidating its holdings before Mr. Boesky settled insider-trading charges. The arbitrager may have known something about Home, traders say.    Currently, Home sells roughly at reported book value, making it appear cheaper than some property-casualty companies. It might appeal to an acquisition-minded company like American General, analysts say. For any astute investor, Home's insurance premiums would be a good source of investment dollars, adds a large Home holder.    Traders say Canada's Sam Belzberg, chairman of First City Financial, has been a big buyer of Home shares, along with Carl Lindner, the Cincinnati financier. The investors didn't return calls. Sam Weinhoff, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, says Home &quot;wouldn't really add anything&quot; to Mr. Lindner's existing insurance operations. While Mr. Belzberg often ends by selling stock back to a company, Home would need approval to buy back shares, regulators say.    George Scharffenberger, Home's chairman, says Home and First City have some joint ventures, and &quot;I know Sam very well.&quot; No one has approached Home about a takeover, he says, and the subject of selling Home &quot;just hasn't come up.&quot; If Home got an offer, he adds, &quot;it would be up to the board&quot; to decide how to respond.    Mr. Scharffenberger, who owns in excess of 400,000 Home shares, made a great deal of money presiding over City's liquidation. He isn't &quot;the type to put up a big fight&quot; if somebody bids for Home, says one investment banker. That's important, he says, because regulators could obstruct a hostile acquirer.    Fueling interest in Home: Marshall Manley, president and chief executive officer, bought shares in recent months at about $19 or $20 a share.    What's Home really worth? In good times it might command twice book value, some analysts say. As of Sept. 30, roughly 25% of Home's book was intangible, making its real book about $15 a share. But because of its poor record, some money managers think Home would be lucky to get $27 a share. That may be the minimum acceptable to management; members' stock options are worthless below that price.    Some holders think Home's goal is to grow its earnings fast to command a top sales price. Recently, it has been writing a lot of specialized, high-margin insurance -- for instance, covering directors' and lawyers' liabilities.    In September, Home hired a new president for its insurance operations, James Meenaghan of John F. Sullivan andamp; Co. He was president and chief operating officer of Fireman's Fund during a period of rapid growth. He resigned in early 1975 after a surge in claims that required a huge addition to Fireman's reserves.    Mr. Scharffenberger says Mr. Meenaghan &quot;has a good, thorough insurance background.&quot; Mr. Meenaghan says Home will &quot;pursue growth aggressively&quot; in some specialized lines, but the growth will be orderly.    Some analysts see Home as a turnaround candidate. They expect it to earn $3.60 a share in 1987, compared with $1.11 a share in 1986, reports Institutional Brokers Estimate System.    But changes in management and direction can bring higher risks, says Shearson's Mr. Weinhoff. If Home's insurance agents are unsettled by the changes, he says, they may not show Home's products to their best customers.    Home's new lines of insurance carry higher-than-average risks, some analysts say. A surge in claims might require additions to reserves that would hurt earnings. Mr. Scharffenberger says Home's reserves are &quot;totally adequate.&quot; It's &quot;easier to measure the risk&quot; of directors' liability than of hurricanes, he adds.    ---   Home Group   (AMEX; Symbol: HME)   Business: Property-casualty insurance.
