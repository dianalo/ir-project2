Shatalov told reporters Friday.   But Shatalov told reporters that ``nothing teaches us more thanthe difficulties we encounter in life.''   Cosmonauts Abdul Ahad Mohmand of Afghanistan and veteran Sovietspaceman Vladimir Lyakhov were stranded in orbit for 26 tense hourson Sept. 6 because of equipment and crew problems on their SoyuzTM-5 capsule. After two unsuccessful attempts to reenter theatmosphere, the capsule landed safely in Soviet Central Asia asfood and oxygen ran dangerously low.   The two cosmonauts, Shatalov and other space scientists faced aMoscow news conference Friday to assess the problems of the flight.   ``I think that after this flight all the experts in spacetechnology, the Mission Control Center and training center willmake many useful conclusions that will be realized in changes inthe design, logic of management, documentation and equipment of thecenter, in the organizational structure and probably in the methodsof cosmonauts' training,'' said Shatalov.   Before the capsule was stranded in space, it docked with the Mirorbiting space station, where it left off a doctor who is tomonitor the health of two cosmonauts conducting experiments theresince December.   After the capsule undocked from the Mir and was preparing toreturn to Earth, a sensor in the Soyuz's guidance system failed tofire an engine that slows down the capsule so it can safely enterthe atmosphere. On a second attempt, the braking engine fired underautomatic control, but shut itself down.   Lyakhov admitted to reporters last week that he had mademistakes, such as improperly restarting the engine after the secondfailed attempt. But he did not refer to the mistake at Friday'sbriefing.   Alexander Dunayev, chief of the space agency Glavkosmos, saidmission control also erred when it did not make a necessaryadjustment to control the speed of the descent. The problem wasdiagnosed and resolved, he said, but ``you can see we made acertain mistake in control and those mistakes should beliquidated.''   Shatalov said Friday that the stranded capsule could have madean emergency landing at various sites in the Soviet Union and inthe United States, Canada and France. But he said the return toEarth was postponed to give mission control and the cosmonauts timeto set up the landing at the planned Soviet site, where groundcrews were waiting to assist the cosmonauts after touchdown.   Dunayev said the Soviets hope to launch an unmanned spaceshuttle this year but want to be completely certain of a successfulmission before a launch is scheduled.</TEXT></DOC>
