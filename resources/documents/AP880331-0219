In a letter to Secretary of State George P. Shultz, the senatorsasked the administration to reconsider its planned notification toCongress of a $450 million support package for AWACS radarsurveillance planes. The money is for training and maintenance ofthe sophisticated intelligence planes which the United States hassold the Saudis.   In light of recent revelations that Saudi Arabia is deployingChinese-made intermediate-range ballistic missiles with a range ofabout 1,850 miles, ``we strongly believe that our current policytoward arms sales to Saudi Arabia must be re-examined,'' the lettersaid.   ``In light of the tremendous threat to regional security, theUnited States should reconsider any new arms sales to the kingdomuntil this matter is fully resolved and the Chinese missiles arewithdrawn,'' the senators wrote.   They also urged the administration to ``make unequivocable itsabsolute opposition to the presence of the Chinese missiles, whichrepresent a new and grave threat to the peace of the region.''   Shultz will be meeting with Saudi officials in Riyadh next weekduring a shuttle mission to the Mideast which begins Sunday. Hewill be lobbying for Israeli-Arab peace talks, but is also expectedto bring up the Chinese missiles.   Shultz already expressed U.S. concern about the sale of theCSS-2 rockets to the Saudis when he spoke in Washington earlierthis month with China's Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian.   The State Department has said it views the missiles as part of adisturbing trend of missile proliferation in the gulf region and inthe Mideast.   Saudi Arbia, an ally of Iraq's, says it needed the missiles toprotect itself in case of a further escalation in the Iran-Iraqwar, especially in view of Iranian threats.   But U.S. officials say the Saudis bought the missiles infrustration over repeated attempts by Congress to block Americanarms sales.   Saudi Arabia began negotiating the deal with the Chinese in1985, after Congress blocked the sale of 48 F-15 jet fighters toSaudi Arabia. Congress late last year agreed to sell the Saudis 24F-15s in order to maintain Saudi air strength at its current levels.   The CSS-2 rockets, which U.S. officials say are not yetoperational, also have a nuclear capability. But both China andSaudi Arabia have assured the United States they do not intend toarm the rockets with nuclear warheads.   ``We are also deeply concerned that the Saudis hid the fact thatthey possess these weapons,'' the letter said. Saudi Arabiareportedly concealed from the United States the deal with China fortwo years, before U.S. aerial intelligence photos exposed the deal.   ``I am most concerned that our intelligence services were unableto detect the acquisition of these missiles,'' said Sen. JesseHelms, R-N.C., in a letter to the chairman of the Foreign RelationsCommittee. Helms called on Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., to holdhearings about the missiles when Congress returns from Easterrecess next month.   Helms said the committee must discuss, among other things,``what this (intelligence) failure suggests about our government'sability to detect'' intermediate-range nuclear missiles in theSoviet Union. Helms is strongly opposed to the U.S.-Soviet treatywhich eliminates such missiles from both countries' arsenals.</TEXT></DOC>
