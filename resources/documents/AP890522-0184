Thai officials said 400 to 800 Burmese troops trying to attackthe rebels from the rear intruded into northern Tak provinceSaturday and burned a village marketplace. Thai border police foundthe bodies of six Burmese soldiers after pushing the intruders backwith artillery fire, officials said Monday.   Government spokesman Suvit Yodmanee said Director General ThepDevakul of the Foreign Ministry's political department summonedBurmese Ambassador Nyunt Swe and lodged a protest.   He said Thailand demanded compensation.   ``So long as they stay inside their borders we consider that aBurmese affair. Once they come into Thailand, it is our policy todrive anybody back, Karens or Burmese,'' Suvit said.   The military government in Rangoon last year killed hundreds ofBurmese in crushing a popular uprising for democracy and vowed todestroy the Karens, an ethnic rebel group that has fought for 40years for greater autonomy.   Thailand said Burmese soldiers over the weekend intruded intoBan Wangkaew village of Mae Sot district, about 235 miles north ofBangkok, and attacked the rebel camp of Kaw Moo Ra, which isseparated from Thailand by the Moei River.   Thai officers said the soldiers were driven back before dawnSunday. They said six bodies were found.   Karen sources claimed 60 to 65 Burmese soldiers were killed infighting Saturday and many wounded. Five rebels were killed and 11wounded, they claimed. One Burmese student fighting alongside therebels was killed and another wounded, they said.   Government forces began their attack on Ko Moo Ra on Thursday,after overrunning the major rebel stronghold of Wangkha two daysearlier.   Rebel officials say the loss of five key border crossings sincethe Burmese intensified their offensive last October has severelydisrupted the black market trade that has sustained theirinsurgency.</TEXT></DOC>
