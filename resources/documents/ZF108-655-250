(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>WITH THE INTRODUCTION of NewWave Office, Hewlett-Packard (HP) will begin toreap the benefits of long-term strategic decisions made over the past fiveyears.andP;  Early commitments to cooperative computing, RISC-based hardware,industry-standard networking, DOS-based personal computers as desktopworkstations, and object orientation are now paying off for HP in its abilityto deliver client/server office products ahead of the competition.andP;  Inaddition, while HP is certainly not the only major computer vendor to committo Unix as a primary office server platform, it is the first to actuallyintroduce a real product.andP;  HP is also forging some interesting third-partypartnerships, and hopes to make its object management model an industrystandard through the Object Management Group (OMG).andM;Until last September, HP occupied a relatively low-profile position in theoffice systems market.andP;  The company was better known for its peripherals,such as the ubiquitous LaserJet printer, than for its proprietary HPDeskManager office system.andP;  Since then, however, the company has fairlyexploded with office announcements.andP;  The standalone NewWave environment forDOS began shipping in September (having been first announced almost two yearsearlier), NewWave Office was introduced in November, and the NewWaveComputing architecture followed in March.andM;Is this why HP is getting so much press these days? It's certainly onereason, but there is more to it than just the products.andP;  Even those who don'thappen to like the way HP implemented NewWave are intrigued with the conceptsand overall strategy behind it.andP;  Is it possible that IBM and DigitalEquipment should be more worried about HP than they are about each other? Inthis issue, we cover HP's office strategy and how the company is positioningNewWave and NewWave Office, as well as an overview of NewWave Office.andM;Building the FoundationandM;As everyone jumps on the bandwagon, anxious to implement cooperativecomputing, RISC-based hardware, industry standards, and strong Unix offeringsbefore the rest of the crowd, HP starts to look like the industry's prescientsage.andP;  HP? made these important decisions years ago.andP;  Not only were they theright decisions, but the company is now positioned to build and marketproducts that take advantage of the underlying architecture and solve realcustomer problems.andM;DISTRIBUTED NETWORK COMPUTING.andP;  HP recognized early the need to migrate to acooperative computing environment.andP;  In 1985, in fact, HP made the decision tobegin the move from a host-based to a client/server model.andM;HP has had cooperative computing products on the market for over four years.andO;Having successfully survived the growing pains associated with such atransition, HP is now moving all of its products in this direction.andP;  InMarch, the company formally unveiled its cooperative computing architectureand strategy-NewWave Computing.andP;  NewWave Computing is a distributed networkcomputing architecture that allows users to select the appropriate operatingsystem for both the client and server with access to object-oriented servicesacross the network.andP;  The ultimate goal is transparent interoperability acrossnetworks of heterogeneous systems.andM;The acquisition of Apollo last year was a strategic move for HP.andP;  In additionto strengthening HP's position in the highly competitive workstation market,Apollo also gives HP Network Computing System (NCS) leadership and access toother distributed network computing technology.andM;NewWave Office, HP's new office offering, is a comerstone of NewWaveComputing and the foundation for HP's office-systems strategy for the 1990s.andM;THE MOVE TO RISC.andP;  In 1984, HP created quite a stir when it publiclyacknowledged its Spectrum RISC program and its intent to move to a RISCarchitecture for price/performance reasons.andP;  The first HP3000 and HP9000systems based on HP's RISC architecture, called Precision Architecture RISC(PA-RISC), were introduced in 1986.andP;  In 1989, HP was the leader in worldwiderevenues for RISC-based systems, according to the RISC Management Newsletter.andM;In the workstation arena, HP has clarified its strategy with regard to Apolloand will combine the HP RISC architecture with that of Apollo within the nextyear.andM;INTEROPERABILITY.andP;  HP has been much clearer than either of its largercompetitors-IBM and Digital-in positioning its proprietary MPE/XL operatingenvironment vis A vis its HP-UX Unix offering.andP;  HP-UX is positioned as thestandards-based, open-systems alternative for commercial applications, withMPE/XL offering optimized transaction processing capabilities.andM;HP is committed to interoperability and coexistence between MPE/XL and HP-UX.andO;One advantage here is that both run on the same underlying PA-RISCarchitecture.andP;  (MPE/XL runs on the HP3000 series; HP-UX runs on the HP9000series.)andM;HP is also ahead of the competition at the applications level.andP;  For example,the entire family of Allbase/SQL relational database products runs on bothMPE and HP-UX.andP;  The interfaces and tools are the same on each platform.andP;  Thenext release of Allbase/Net will allow connectivity between WE and UnixAllbase databases.andP;  The NewWave Office servers for MPE/XL and Unix willinteroperate at the service level for both mail and database access.andO;Interoperability is particularly important to those customers who want tomigrate from a proprietary system to an open system.andM;ROLE OF UNIX.andP;  There is no doubt that Unix plays a strategic role for HP.andO;HP-UX is based on and fully complies with ATandamp;T's System V, and HP intends tomerge HP-UX with OSF/1 and OSF/2 in the future.andP;  HP-UX has a strongunderlying hardware platform in HP's extensive family of HP9000 servers andworkstations, including symmetric multiprocessing capabilities.andM;While it has a strong presence in the technical Unix market, HP is focusingheavily on commercial Unix in its marketing efforts.andP;  IBM, on the other hand,is leading with the technical market, and Digital is having a difficult timebringing its RISC/Ultrix platform into parity, in both functionality andmarketing focus, with its proprietary, more robust VAX/VMS platform.andM;Office.andP;  Thus, it is no surprise that Unix plays a significant role in HP'soffice strategy.andP;  HP is acutely aware of the opportunities here, and of thefact that its traditional office competitors, IBM and Digital, are sorelybehind in the Unix arena.andP;  Nowhere to be seen, in fact.andP;  They are only takingin general terms about what they intend to do in the future; the onlyproducts they can market today are third-party offerings from Uniplex,Applix, and Quadratron.andP;  (While DECwrite and DECwindows are both available onDigital's Ultrix platform, there is no Ultrix equivalent to All-In-1functionality.) We fully expect IBM and Digital to get their respective actstogether and begin to move forward in the Unix office arena, but HP couldhave a sizeable headstart by then.andP;  We may not see OfficeVision on AIX for acouple of years.andP;  Digital is still busy cleaving All-In-1 into aclient/server mode on VMS, and it does not yet have a database on Unix.andM;Office software competitors such as Uniplex, Applix, and Quadratron have theadvantage of running on diverse Unix platforms.andP;  HP's approach here is tocreate alliances with these vendors and interoperate with their products.andM;In the Unix environment in particular, HP sees the potential for NewWave andNewWave Office to exist on a broad range of vendor platforms.andP;  OpenMail, theNewWave Office transport in Unix, is architected for portability, and HP isworking with third parties willing to port it to other operating platforms.andM;The Desktop as the Design CenterandM;Prior to announcing NewWave in late 1987, HP had followed the same generalpath in developing office systems as everyone else in the minicomputerindustry.andP;  Original products were time shared and terminal based with thehost performing all of the work.andP;  As the PC began to dominate the desktop inthe mid 1980s, at least some portion of the office processing moved to theDOS platform, most notably the user interface, local mail functions, and wordprocessing.andP;  HP was an early convert to the power of the PC, and it hasalways had a strong cooperative PC front end to its HP DeskManager officesystem on the HP3000 platform.andM;With NewWave, however, HP began a different approach to office.andP;  The designcenter moved to the desktop as HP focused first on dealing with the enduser's frustration in having to adapt how he or she wanted to work to thevagaries and inconsistencies of existing hardware and software design.andP;  Here,HP based its product development on a business model rather than a technologymodel.andP;  The business model evolved into a set of design criteria that led HPto its ultimate objective-to provide an enabling environment that allowspeople to work the way they want to work.andP;  You will notice that objectorientation is not a specific design criterion of NewWave or NewWave Office.andO;Rather, HP chose an object management model as the technology that could bestmeet its business design goals.andM;The first product to embody HP's vision of its design criteria was thestandalone NewWave environment for DOS.andM;THE UNDERLYING MODEL.andP;  When customers say they are looking for ways todevelop a competitive edge using office/information systems, HP translatesthis into the need for systems that enable the user to effectively transformraw data into a decision to act.andP;  Basic requirements are easy access to datastored in online transaction processing (OLTP) production systems, and theability to analyze and manipulate the data with integrated tools.andP;  HP'sinformation flow model reflects these needs and is a key foundation fordesigning both the NewWave environment and NewWave Office.andP;  It is also usedwithin HP as a basis for other types of information systems (e.g., processcontrol and just-in-time manufacturing).andM;This model has driven HP's office product development, pushing the company toidentify gaps in the tools it provides and gaps in how these tools and theirassociated data flow together.andP;  Where there are holes, HP will recruitappropriate third-party partners; in many cases, HP is more likely to do thisthan to develop the software internally.andP;  HP clearly states that it is nolonger in the application development business.andP;  Rather, its primary missionis to provide an open and consistent  enabling environment&quot; into which theuser and third-party vendor can easily integrate the tools-both old andnew-required to get the job done.andP;  HP does provide some applicationcapabilities within its environment-compound document processing, graphics,mail, and database access.andP;  Thus, the user can do something useful in theenvironment even without buying any third-party applications.andP;  However, HPlooks to third parties for more sophisticated applications.)andM;DESIGN CRITERIA.andP;  HP has identified four design criteria for building systemsthat reduce the user's  Lime to action.&quot;andM;Commitment to Industry Standards.andP;  Commitment to standards is increasinglyimportant to customers, especially large, multinational, Fortune 500companies that want interoperability across heterogeneous systems.andP;  Byinteroperability, we mean transparent access to data and services regardlessof the platform on which they reside and the ability to actually do somethingwith the data once it is captured.andP;  In addition to industry-standardnetworking, which HP has offered for years, the company is committed tocompliance with ANSI SQL, X.400, X.500, LAN Manager, ODA/ODIF, desktopwindowing managers (MS Windows, Presentation Manager, OSF/Motif), OSF/1, etal.andM;User-Oriented Desktop Metaphor.andP;  HP has been quite successful in architectingNewWave to appeal to the end user.andP;  A primary objective is to follow asclosely as possible the traditional, manual office model-the way people dothings in the office when they don't have an automated system.andP;  HP has usedthis office model as another baseline in making its design decisions forNewWave, deviating only when necessary to improve the user's effectiveness orto incorporate a concept outside the model (such as the &quot;check out&quot; option innetwork object storage).andP;  In NewWave, the focus is on the task that the userwants to perform rather than on the specific application(s) required toperform it.andM;Let's look at mailing a document.andP;  The manual model is to create thedocument(s) to be sent, type or write the envelope, insert the document(s),and put the envelope in the outbox for delivery to the mail room.andP;  To do thisin an automated office system, you usually must first invoke an electronicmail system.andP;  Typically, this involves choosing E-mail from a menu and thenentering addressees, a cover message, and the names of the documents to sendwith the message (often called attachments).andM;To mail an object in NewWave Office, you merely pick up the object and dropit on the Out-Tray icon (which brings up the addressee dialog box).andP;  You canalso create outgoing envelopes as objects on your desktop, move one or moreother objects into an envelope, and then drop the envelope on the Out-Tray.andO;This is a much more intuitive approach for the user, and it can reduce thenumber of steps required.andM;Another objective of NewWave is masking complexity for the user-complexity ofthe operating system, the file system, application integration, andapplications development.andM;Choice of Platforms.andP;  Like almost every other company in the business, HPclearly recognizes the need to give the customer a choice of both server andclient platforms.andP;  With NewWave Office, Unix and OS/2 have been added toMPE/XL as servers and to DOS on the client side.andM;Modular Integration of Applications.andP;  A major feature of HP's strategy is theability to easily integrate applications on the desktop.andP;  An important issueis the integration of existing desktop applications, enabling the user toleverage current investments in software and training.andP;  The NewWave ObjectManagement Facility (OMF) is key here.andP;  NewWave provides several levels ofintegration, including encapsulation for limited integration of existingapplications without modification, and the OMF APIs for creating fullyfunctional NewWave applications.andM;WORKGROUP EXTENSIONS.andP;  NewWave Office, which was announced in November, 1989,extends the NewWave environment to workgroups, providing mail, databaseaccess, and object storage across the network.andM;In summary, HP's approach has been to design for the desktop and then expandthe model to the network, implementing the client/server model from thebeginning and leveraging current server products to the extent possible.andP;  Thecompany has not attempted to move its current office products lock, stock,and barrel to the new environment.andP;  The competition has generally come fromthe opposite direction, focusing more on cleaving current host-based officeproducts to conform to a client/server architecture, and then designing thedesktop environment to support this architecture.andM;One of the trade-offs Hewlett-Packard has made in focusing on the intelligentdesktop is the exclusion of terminals from participation in the graphicalNewWave environment.andM;ROLE OF THIRD PARTIES.andP;  Attracting a critical mass of software developers tothe NewWave platform is vital to HP's long-term success.andP;  HP is working withboth independent software vendors (ISVs) and value-added resellers (VARs) toincorporate NewWave Office into their application products.andP;  To date, about100 ISVs have committed to NewWave.andP;  The well-publicized American Airlinesmove to NewWave has had a positive impact in this area.andP;  We expect a similarbolstering of third-party confidence to stem from the interest other vendorshave shown in licensing NewWave.andM;The focus for ISVs is to make their software products NewWave compliant.andP;  Oneof the obstacles for ISVs in DOS is the requirement to write to MS Windows.andO;Some of the largest and most coveted ISVs (e.g., Lotus, WordPerfect, andAshton-Tate) have been reluctant to embrace the MS Windows environment.andO;Lotus recently announced that it will take over responsibility for theexisting NewWave browser for Lotus 1-2-3.andP;  This was developed by HP (andcomes with NewWave) to allow Lotus spreadsheets to play an integrated role inNewWave without requiring Lotus to write to NewWave.andP;  While this is riot afull commitment to NewWave, Lotus will enhance the browser to support Release2.2 (e.g., memory enhancements and support for color).andP;  WordPerfect hasfinally committed to Windows 3.0 and plans to introduce a Windows productlater this year.andM;VARs are encouraged to incorporate pieces of NewWave Office, such asInformation Access, into their vertical applications written for themini/server.andP;  VARs can also convert their applications to the cooperativeprocessing model, separating the client and server components.andM;ObjectsandM;HP is a clear leader in the move to object-based information managementsystems.andP;  HP accurately recognized the importance of this over two years ago,and set out to make leadership in object management one of its primary stakesin the ground.andP;  The company's obvious success has positioned the NewWave OMFas the current standard against which all subsequent object-oriented officeofferings will be judged.andP;  HP was also a primary catalyst in the formation ofthe Object Management Group (OMG), which is very quickly becoming a powerfulforce in the industry.andM;OBJECT MANAGEMENT FACILITY.andP;  The NewWave OMF is the object managementcomponent  of NewWave.andP;  It provides a database-like function, keeping trackof the status and relationships of all objects on the NewWave desktop.andP;  TheOMF gives the user ease-of-use and consistency across platforms.andP;  It hidesboth the operating system and the underlying filing system from the user,making the NewWave interface and filing system the same regardless ofoperating platform.andM;The OMF provides the following:andM;* Binding of data and applications in to objects.andP;  When youandM;create a Lotus spreadsheet, for example, the OMF links theandM;spreadsheet to the Lotus application.andP;  When you double-clickandM;on the icon for the spreadsheet object, the OMF knows toandM;activate Lotus and automatically brings in the correct data.andM;* Management of information links between objects.andP;  InformationandM;links are views of data from one object contained inandM;another object.andP;  An example here is a compound documentandM;containing a range of cells from a spreadsheet.andP;  If youandM;double-click on the spreadsheet from within the compoundandM;document, the OMF knows to activate Lotus and open theandM;spreadsheet.andP;  When you exit from Lotus, you are back in theandM;compound  document once again.andM;Currently, the OMF only has to keep track of linksandM;among one user's objects on the desktop.andP;  No links areandM;maintained across the network.andP;  Distributed NewWave,andM;incorporating a distributed ONE, is an important futureandM;development for  HP.andM;* Horizontal integration.andP;  Every application written to theandM;NewWave APIs gets &quot;instant integration&quot; with all otherandM;NewWave-compliant applications.andP;  Once an applicationandM;incorporates the necessary OMF calls, it does not need to knowandM;anything about any other application on the desktop to achieveandM;integration.andP;  Each application only has to know its ownandM;processing and how to express itself when asked by the OMF.andM;The OMF takes care of all the links and communication betweenandM;objects.andP;  Thus the developer can use NewWave applications asandM;interchangeable parts in building more complex or specializedandM;applications.andP;  This facilitates the rapid assembly of newandM;applications with the opportunity for a significantandM;productivity improvement.andP;  This is one of NewWave's mostandM;significant competitive advantages, one that is not alwaysandM;immediately obvious.andP;  Horizontal integration also allowsandM;NewWave to be a full multimedia environment.andM;* Persistence.andP;  Persistence is one of the major differencesandM;between Microsoft's Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) and HP'sandM;OMF.andP;  The OMF provides persistence by bringing your desktopandM;back the way you left it, supporting and maintaining theandM;creation of five links between objects, and permitting theandM;sharing of objects.andP;  NewWave, however, does not limit theandM;functionality of DDE.andP;  An application using DDE can continueandM;to do so within the NewWave environment.andM;Encapsulation.andP;  Encapsulation is an important part of HP's approach toapplication integration, allowing the user to leverage existing softwareinvestments.andP;  Encapsulation builds a software shell around a non-NewWave DOSapplication to allow it to work unmodified in an object environment.andP;  Theshell essentially provides communication among the application, the OMF, andthe agent facility.andP;  Thus, the user does not have to wait for the applicationdeveloper to migrate to the full NewWave environment before incorporating afavorite application program.andP;  This modular approach comes the closest of anywe've seen yet to offering the user the option to choose best in class&quot; andget at least some minimal level of integration.andM;The benefit of the encapsulation feature cannot be underestimated, and HPwill include this in both the Unix and OS/2 NewWave clients.andM;Encapsulation provides the following:andM;*Binding the data to the application and displaying theandM;resulting object as an icon on the desktop, permitting it to beandM;manipulated as a NewWave object.andP;  You may choose an icon from aandM;library provided by HP or create an icon of your own if youandM;have the Developer's Kit.andM;*A cut-and-paste option (text or graphics data only) betweenandM;the DOS object and other objects on the desktop.andP;  This is doneandM;via the NewWave clipboard.andM;*Context-switching between the DOS application and theandM;NewWave desktop.andM;*The ability to include the application in Agent tasks.andM;OBJECT MANAGEMENT GROUP.andP;  Hewlett-Packard would like to see its NewWave OMFadopted as a standard by the Object Management Group (OMG).andP;  HP is a foundingmember of the OMG; the only major vendors that are not yet members are IBMand Microsoft.andM;Adoption of a standard object management model is one of the primary goals ofthe OMG.andP;  The intent is to provide the foundation for heterogeneous objectsharing and to avoid the development of multiple object models in theindustry.andP;  The object model will include standards for object definition,class libraries, and facilities for managing, accessing, and working withobjects.andP;  Although the NewWave OMF does not have any real competitors at thispoint for what it offers, it does not yet provide a full object model.andP;  Forexample, the OMF lacks inheritance and distributed object facilities,features that are of major interest to the OMG.andP;  Therefore, we ultimatelyexpect a compromise of some kind, with OMG members in addition to HPcontributing to the final standard.andM;The AgentandM;Procedural automation using a cross-application macro facility is anotherarea where HP correctly anticipated customer needs.andP;  HP essentiallyintroduced the concept of the personal Agent to the industry with NewWave;the user can program Agent tasks to do the user's bidding when activated.andP;  Anumber of vendors, including NewWave licensee ATandamp;T, are planning to focus onprocedural automation as a way to differentiate their office systems from thecompetition.andM;An Agent task can automate anything the user can do within the NewWaveenvironment, spanning multiple applications on the desktop.andP;  Agent tasks canbe recorded, edited using the task language, and scheduled to execute atspecific times.andP;  HP will investigate adding artificial intelligencecapability to the NewWave Agent facility to create the intelligent Agent.andM;The long-awaited Agent facility is not yet available in NewWave but will beintroduced in the next release (which is expected late this summer).andM;An Independent StanceandM;Partnerships have become increasingly important in the industry over the pasttwo years, and HP is taking this trend in new directions.andP;  One of the mostintriguing aspects of HP's strategy is the formation of partnerships andalliances, not only with third-party ISVs and VARs, but also withcompetitors.andP;  By doing this, HP is positioning itself as an independentsupplier as well as a primary competitor marketing its own office systems.andO;So far, the company has been successful playing both roles, and both sideshave gained significant benefits from the competitor alliances.andM;LICENSING NEWWAVE.andP;  HP is actively pursuing OEMs for NewWave, offeringNewWave, the OMF, and network object storage for licensing by other computervendors.andP;  This is another facet, along with the OMG efforts, of HP's approachto making NewWave a de facto industry standard, the graphical front-endenvironment of choice.andP;  Data General has already licensed NewWave as thefront end for its CEO Object Office product.andP;  Most recently, NCR and ATandamp;Thave announced that they  will  incorporate NewWave into their forthcomingclient/server-based Unix office systems.andP;  We expect to hear about other majorlicensing announcements from HP over the next few months.andM;By allowing other vendors to license NewWave, isn't HP giving up asignificant competitive advantage? While the company maintains that it willstill work to maintain a competitive advantage in its overall office suite(and in its hardware architecture, price/performance, network services,service and support, etc.), adherence to a common object model will help HPdevelop interoperability with other vendors' systems.andP;  HP sees this as abasic customer requirement.andP;  And the real bottom line to HP's competitiveadvantage is the NewWave source code, which HP is not currently offering toits licensees.andM;HP also has a joint development agreement with Canon to develop a Japaneseversion of NewWave on all three client platforms-DOS, Unix, and OS/2.andM;The major impact here is that vendors in addition to HP will be lobbying forNewWave to become the standard, as weB as recruiting third parties.andM;UNIPLEX ALLIANCE.andP;  HP also wants to see its Unix mail transport, OpenMail,become the de facto Unix mail system, and is offering to license OpenMail toother Unix vendors.andP;  Uniplex, with its strong integrated office offering forUnix, was a natural target and the first to grab the OpenMail opportunity.andO;In January, HP and Uniplex announced an agreement from which both will reapimportant benefits.andM;Uniplex will integrate OpenMail as the mail transport into its Uniplex Officeproduct by early 1991, replacing its own mail system.andP;  OpenMail will providekey enhancements for Uniplex-improved directory management and systemmanagement, native X.400 capability, and interoperability with other standardUnix mail systems.andM;HP gets three significant benefits from this relationship.andP;  First, HP willsell the full Uniplex Office product fine (except the Uniplex DOS software)on the HP-UX platform.andP;  Since NewWave Office doesn't address serverapplications for Unix terminal users, Uniplex Office will fill the gap forHP.andP;  OpenMail on both platforms will ensure mail interoperability for allusers.andP;  Customers who want office services for PC and terminal users caninstall both NewWave Office and Uniplex on the Unix server, but will only buyOpenMail once.andM;Second, Uniplex represents the first and largest &quot;domino&quot; in the Unix arenain HP's quest to establish OpenMail as a de facto standard on open systems.andO;Since Uniplex Office runs on over 200 Unix platforms, this alone will give HPa strong presence on a wide variety of systems.andM;Third, Uniplex is assisting HP in porting OpenMail as a standalone product tothe top 20 or so Unix platforms-Sun, Prime, Sequent, IBM's AIX, Digital'sUltrix, etc.andP;  This gives HP a foot in the door and a great opportunity tocompete for the enterprise communication backbone in Unix.andP;  Having a singlemail system accepted across multiple platforms overcomes the problemsinherent in trying to integrate directory, administration, and file exchangeservices across disparate mail systems.andP;  A significant note here is the factthat HP's OpenMail will arrive on IBM and Digital's doorstep (this summer)before they introduce their own Unix mail products.andP;  (Digital does have mailwithin DECwindows, but this is not its new X.400 offering yet)andM;NewWave OfficeandM;Note: For a complete evaluation of the NewWave environment and NewWaveOffice, see Unix in the Office, Vol.andP;  5 No.andP;  4.andP;  The first implementation ofHP's NewWave Office framework consists of the following:andM;* NewWave environment (a single-user license is included)andM;* Network object storageandM;* Information access (access to databases across the network)andM;* Information distribution (mail system)andM;* Shared resourcesandM;* Networked PC managementandM;NewWave Office extends the scope of the standalone NewWave environment beyondthe individual desktop to the workgroup, providing access to network servers,services, and data.andP;  (See  News and Analysis,&quot; Vol.andP;  13, No.andP;  1, for adiagram of the NewWave Office Functional Definition).andM;SERVERS.andP;  NewWave Office will run on three server platforms.andM;* NewWave Office for MPE on an HP3000 running MPE/XLandM;* NewWave Office for Unix on an HP9000 (series 600 and 800) running HP-UXVersion 7.0 or laterandM;* NewWave Office for OS/2 on a 286/386 PC running OS/2andM;The servers for MPE/XL and Unix are both available now, and interoperate atthe service level for both mail and database access.andP;  They are alsoequivalent in functionality, with the same services and applicationutilities.andP;  The only exception is PC hard disk backup, available only on MPE.andO;HP has not announced a date for availability of the OS/2 version of NewWaveOffice, and it has not yet committed to putting the networked PC managementfunctions on OS/2.andM;CLIENTS.andP;  The NewWave client software is only available on DOS currently.andO;Here, NewWave uses Microsoft Windows to provide capabilities that theoperating system lacks (e.g., a messaging system and context-switching).andP;  TheNewWave developer on the DOS platform must write to both Windows and theNewWave APIs to get a fully compliant NewWave application.andP;  On the Unix andOS/2 platforms, however, these capabilities are part of the operating system,and the developer will not be required to write to a particular windowingmanager.andM;DOS.andP;  The NewWave DOS client software runs under Microsoft Windows, the defacto standard for window management on DOS.andP;  NewWave currently runs onWindows/286 Version 2.11.andP;  The next release of NewWave (3.0), coming latethis summer, will run on Windows 3.0.andP;  NewWave 3.0 will take full advantageof Windows 3.0 enhancements, such as three-dimensional icons, color, andbetter memory management.andP;  This last improvement will allow NewWave to runwith 2MB of extended memory rather than the currently recommended 3MB.andM;Unix.andP;  The NewWave client for HP's Unix platform will use Motif as thewindowing manager.andP;  HP VUE, HP's implementation of Motif, will ship thissummer, the company is building NewWave for Unix on top of this.andP;  HP maydecide to bundle HP VUE with the NewWave software.andP;  (With the advent ofWindows 3.0, Windows, Motif, and Presentation Manager look almost identicalto the user.)andM;The Unix client is not available yet, and HP has disclosed no dates for this.andO;However, the NewWave Developer's Kit for Unix will ship by the end of thisyear.andP;  The end-user client software will probably appear six to nine monthslater.andM;Until the Unix client software is released, Unix workstations will be limitedto terminal emulation access to NewWave Office services such as mail andshared resources.andM;OS/2.andP;  The OS/2 client is also not available yet, but HP states that theNewWave Developers Kit for OS/2 Presentation Manager will ship at about thesame time as the one for Unix.andM;HP is still deciding which client to release first-Unix or OS/2-and iscurrently working hard on the development of both.andP;  This has become an evenmore difficult issue with the advent of Unix/386.andP;  The company is monitoringclosely the demand for OS/2 vs.andP;  Unix/386 vs.andP;  HP's RISC/Unix platform.andP;  Thecompany views OS/2 as the successful follow-on to DOS, and a particularlygood platform for HP since the company has focused so heavily on integratingthe DOS platform into its office strategy.andP;  While Unix is probably moreimportant to HP (commercially, that is) in the short term, the company viewsOS/2 as very important in the long term.andM;Macintosh.andP;  Since the Macintosh already has a graphical user interface,customers with Macs are not exactly beating down the door to get NewWave onthis platform.andP;  They are much more interested in access to network services,which is where HP is focusing its efforts.andP;  The priorities are to provideterminal emulation over a LAN, access to print-sharing and file-sharing,client mail access, and client database access.andM;Today, AdvanceLink on the Macintosh provides terminal emulation and filetransfer, accessing a host HP3000 server.andP;  AdvanceLink will support access toHP Unix servers in July.andP;  For file-and print-sharing, HP will OEM LAN Managerfor the Mac from 3Com (enabling the Mac to get file-and print-sharing from anOS/2 LAN Manager server), and will provide LM/X support through a third partyby the end of 1990.andP;  When HP implements LAN Manager on MPE next year, it willalso offer file-and print-sharing for the Mac.andM;The next step is to have a mail client for the Mac, accessing either HPDeskor OpenMail, in 1991.andP;  HP is investigating a third-party linkup for this aswell as for client database access.andM;THE NEWWAVE ENVIRONMENT.andP;  The NewWave environment currently provides thegraphical NewWave desktop, NewWave Write (a compound document processor), aLotus browser (for viewing Lotus spreadsheets within NewWave objects), a Helpfunction, computer-based training, and the encapsulation software.andP;  As wehave mentioned, the Agent will be implemented in the next release of NewWave.andM;Compound Objects.andP;  In keeping to its commitment to standards, HP is notburdening us with yet another compound document/object architecture (thankyou, HP).andP;  Rather, the company is adopting and supporting existing industrystandards.andP;  HP's strategy here is to provide ODA/ODIF conversions withinNewWave Office.andP;  NewWave currently supports IBM's Document ContentArchitecture (DCA), with conversions between both text and NewWave Writeformats and DCA.andP;  Coming will be ODA/ODIF conversions from Keyword OfficeTechnologies.andM;NewWave Write.andP;  NewWave Write provides an easy-to-use compound documenteditor.andP;  HP is not marketing the product as a sophisticated word processorsince it has only basic editing and formatting capabilities.andP;  HP is lookingto third parties to provide high-end WP requirements within the NewWaveenvironment (e.g., Samna's Ami Professional).andM;NewWave Write supports live (hot) links between objects in a compounddocument.andP;  All NewWave Write knows about an embedded object is its name, itssize, and where it is in the document.andP;  When the object is activated, NewWaveWrite calls the OMF and the OMF calls the application, instructing it todisplay itself in a window.andM;The compound document facility only works for full NewWave applications andencapsulated applications that have browsers.andP;  A browser knows how to displaythe data format for a non-NewWave application.andP;  HP has written browsers forLotus and its own Gallery Collection.andP;  If a vendor doesn't want to modify orwrite an application to embed OMF calls, it can instead write a browser (HPprovides specs for this).andP;  However, HP is not pushing this solution becauseit takes as much (or more) effort for the developer to write a browser as itdoes to make an application fully NewWave compliant.andM;When a compound object is mailed, NewWave makes a copy of all linked objectsfor the recipient; no links are maintained across the network in the currentimplementation.andP;  The recipient must have the application locally to edit thelinked objects.andP;  The recipient can use the browser to at least view and printthe object if the application isn't available.andM;Developer Tools.andP;  Effective development tools are a critical factor ingetting ISVs committed to the NewWave platform.andP;  Although HP will developsome tools for its specific customer operating requirements (e.g., Cobol ortransaction processing), it will rely primarily on third parties for tools.andM;NETWORK OBJECT STORAGE.andP;  The first major step toward full distributed objectmanagement is sharing objects across the network.andP;  In NewWave Office, objectscan be stored on any server on which a share (virtual drive) can be defined.andO;A network folder is defined on the desktop to hold objects stored on theserver; the folder points to a specific share on the server.andM;If the user copies or moves a compound object to a network server, all of theembedded linked objects are also copied to the server as part of the compoundobject.andP;  Thus, the live links are not maintained across the network to theoriginal objects but are maintained within the copied compound object.andO;Network-wide live links will come with the distributed version of NewWave.andM;All objects in a network folder are available to anyone with access to theshare.andP;  In addition to copying or moving objects contained in a networkfolder, there is also a check-out/check-in facility.andP;  Once an object ischecked out, another user can copy the object from the network folder, but heor she cannot open the original object in the folder.andM;Creating a share creates an index on the server indicating what objects arestored there, which ones are checked out, and by whom.andP;  There is only oneindex per share, although it is possible to have multiple network folderspointing to the same share.andM;INFORMATION ACCESS.andP;  HP considers its Information Access product a keydifferentiator arid an important part of NewWave Office.andP;  It is a trueclient/server application, providing access to both remote and localdatabases.andP;  Currently, the client is a character-based DOS application,encapsulated within NewWave.andP;  It will be NewWave compliant later this year.andO;The server software, available on both MPE and Unix, accesses HP'sAllbase/SQL and Oracle (Unix and MPE), and TurboImage and KSAM  MPE only).andO;Access to IBM's DB2 is available on a custom basis, with full integrationcoming in future releases.andP;  Local PC databases can include Lotus, dbase, andR:Base.andM;MAIL.andP;  The mail transports for NewWave Office are the Desk-Manager mailserver for MPE and liP OpenMail for Unix.andP;  HP OpenMail, HP's standards-basedmail server for HP-UX, provides native X.400 P1/P2 compliance, conforms toX/Open portability specs, and uses Sendmail, an established Unix transportsystem, for the transmission of messages.andP;  HP is porting OpenMail to the OS/2server as well.andM;The mail transports are interoperable.andP;  Thus, in a mixed environment, an MPEserver can use OpenMail for X.400 connectivity, and OpenMail has access tomail gateways which are supported by DeskManager (e.g., IBM's PROFS, DISOSS,and HP Telex).andP;  A fax gateway for both DeskManager and OpenMail will shipthis July.andM;HP has well-developed online directory services of its own, and the companyis committed to supporting X.500 on both Unix and MPE in the future.andM;NewWave Mail.andP;  NewWave Mail, the NewWave Office client software for mail,runs only on DOS today.andP;  AdvanceMail III is the non-NewWave PC DOS client forboth OpenMail and DeskManager.andP;  Unix workstations and terminals accessOpen-Mail via terminal emulation (which looks like AdvanceMail).andP;  In thefuture, HP will have a Motif-based OpenMail client for Unix.andM;PC LAN Mail.andP;  HP is approaching PC LANs from two directions.andP;  First, it isporting OpenMail to run on PC-based LAN servers.andP;  It will be available on SCOUnix/386 in September and on OS/2 by early next year.andP;  Second, HP is workingwith 3Com to jointly provide a gateway between OpenMail and 3Com's 3+ OpenMail.andP;  We expect this by year end.andP;  HP also supports Novell LAN PCs via theHP NS LAN gateway on MPE.andM;DOCUMENT SERVICES.andP;  HP's first NewWave document service will be its AdvancedImage Management System (AIMS), announced in April for delivery to targeteddevelopers this month and general availability in August.andP;  HP AIMS is atoolkit for creating image-capable applications that includes a 4GL and auser-interface builder.andP;  It adheres to the client/server model, with thefront end running on DOS and the server on the HP9000 and SCO Unix/386platforms.andM;The underpinning for HP AIMS is the Plexus XDP system, which uses theSQL-based Informix database to manage image storage.andP;  HP has added supportfor HP peripherals and networking, plus the NewWave client environment.andP;  Theclient HP AIMS software is encapsulated and will eventually be a full NewWaveapplication.andP;  HP AIMS supports optical storage devices, including jukeboxes,and CCITT Group 4 image compression.andM;SHARED RESOURCES.andP;  Resource-sharing for NewWave clients (e.g., access tofiles and printers) is provided by MS-NET WE), LAN Manager/X (Unix), arid LANManager (OS/2).andP;  In the initial release of NewWave Office, HP will notinclude LAN Manager/X support on the DOS client.andP;  This will be providedthrough a compatible MS-NET-based OfficeShare client that permits fullshared-resource capability with HP LAN Manager/X.andP;  The LAN Manager/X clientwill come with the second release of NewWave Office for Unix (late 1990) andwill be supported as a separate product this summer.andP;  HP also plans tosupport LAN Manager on MPE in the future.andM;NETWORKED PC MANAGEMENT.andP;  One of HP's primary objectives was to make aNewWave Office LAN easy to install and administer.andP;  Networked PC managementservices automatically configure the server, assign node names and addresses,identify shared peripherals, establish default public and private shares,configure client software for each networked PC, and provide PC backup.andP;  PCbackup applies to MPE only, although both MPE and Unix servers canautomatically back up any DOS files stored on the server as shared objects.andM;Future enhancements to NewWave Office system services include unattendedautomation of software distribution for third-party DOS applications; theaddition of utilities to manage PC software usage (e.g., version and licensecontrol); server installation of LAN Manager clients; a graphical userinterface for the administrator; and central control of networks withmultiple LAN servers.andM;FuturesandM;In addition to the many enhancements we have already mentioned in ourdiscussion of NewWave Office, developments are underway in several othermajor areas.andM;DISTRIBUTED NEWWAVE.andP;  Having the OMF capability at the server level iscritically important to the next generation of NewWave Office.andP;  As you putmultiple NewWave servers on the network, the OMF must begin to communicatewith remote servers.andP;  This requires a server-based OMF-to-OMF communicationfacility, which doesn't exist in the product today.andP;  HP is still in theprocess of development here.andP;  It is merging its OMF with Apollo's NCStechnology to achieve distributed NewWave.andP;  Moreover, HP is investigating thepossible implementation of warm links.andM;The distributed NewWave concept will not be dependent upon NewWave Office.andO;It win be designed as a general facility with applicability to other areassuch as manufacturing and engineering.andP;  HP intends to license distributedNewWave when it becomes available.andM;CUSTOMIZABLE INTERFACE.andP;  To make NewWave attractive to users outside theoffice arena, HP intends to implement multiple conceptual models andmetaphors in the Unix and OS/2 versions.andP;  The user will be able to choose themost appropriate environment in which to work: the desktop, a productionline, a CAD workbench, etc.andM;PRESENTATION INDEPENDENCE.andP;  The requirement that developers write to both theNewWave and the window manager APIs can be a problem for developers writingto multiple operating platforms.andP;  HP is working with third parties to developa layer of software that fits between the NewWave environment and thewindowing manager to provide presentation independence.andP;  This would allow thedeveloper to write only to the NewWave APIs.andP;  The additional layer ofsoftware would take care of adapting to the appropriate underlying windowingmanager.andP;  This would go a long way to attracting third parties to the NewWaveenvironment, a critical factor in HP's strategy.andM;PRESENTATION/SEMANTIC SPLIT.andP;  HP's ultimate goal is to separate thepresentation or interface from the semantic objects in the environment.andP;  (Asemantic object is one that manipulates data, such as a database manager).andO;In an object-oriented environment, objects communicate through messages.andP;  Oneobject sends a message to another object: &quot;express yourself.&quot; The objectexpresses itself and sends back a message to the requesting object.andP;  Theobjects never touch each other, an &quot;ask, don't touch&quot; approach.andP;  Therefore,objects do not need to know intimate details about each other and what theyare or do.andP;  Each object only needs to have an understanding of how itinterprets and executes standard messages.andM;As an object in the system, the interface would keep track of the screenlayout and movements on the screen.andP;  These movements would be formulated intomessages and then sent to the appropriate semantic object(s), which could belocated on the same workstation or on a remote workstation/server.andO;Separating the interface from other objects, such as a mail server,facilitates the existence of multiple presentation objects, each representinga different look-and-feel and/or behavior.andM;HP has in fact demonstrated this, allowing a presentation object under OS/2and one under Unix to display a single semantic object residing on a Unixserver.andM;WORKGROUP APPLICATIONS.andP;  HP has had much demand for calendar/schedulingcapabilities within NewWave Office.andP;  It is developing a NewWave interface tothe DeskManager time management function for MPE, and extending OpenMail toinclude a scheduling capability.andM;Another top priority enhancement is mail-enabled applications, such as serialrouting and electronic authorization.andP;  HP feels these will have a strongimpact on customer demand in conjunction with X.400 and EDI capabilities.andO;With OpenMail ported to a broad range of platforms, the customer will be ableto put into place an enterprise-wide communication system with significantadded value.andM;ConclusionsandM;We have identified two strategic enabling technologies for computing in the'90s-distributed network computing and object orientation.andP;  HP has managed tostake out a strong leadership position in both areas.andP;  And HP is very seriousabout its push for de facto acceptance of NewWave and OpenMail as industrystandards.andP;  The company also places a strong emphasis on its Unix serverplatform.andP;  HP's significant new server products-OpenMail and AIMS-are bothUnix based, and NewWave Office for Unix is getting equal billing with MPE.andM;One of the strategic directions for HP is its emphasis on providing standardand open interfaces to products rather than mandating standardimplementations of products.andP;  This approach to standards allows vendors tomodify and enhance the underlying products without blowing away all of theapplication developer's work.andP;  And the developer doesn't have to care whatthe underlying platform/product is.andM;We will see HP implement this philosophy in phases over the next few years.andO;For example, the DeskManager mail server and OpenMail will initially havedifferent APIs.andP;  A developer writing to both mail systems will have to writeto both sets of APIs.andP;  The first step for HP might be to develop a layer ofsoftware that masks the differences for the developer, even though theunderlying APIs don't change.andP;  Over time, however, we would expect HP toconverge the APIs and eliminate the need for the intervening layer ofsoftware.andP;  And HP is not reluctant to extrapolate this approach across aheterogeneous computing environment.andP;  Why not provide a layer of softwarethat masks the differences wrong HP, Digital, and IBM mail transports, forexample, for the developer? The ultimate analogy here is that of the standardand familiar wall outlet.andP;  As long as what you have can plug in to theoutlet, it doesn't matter what electrical device it is, or what utilitycompany provides the power.andP;  HP wants to define a comparable &quot;wall outlet&quot;for applications software.andM;As it turns out, HP, just like IBM and Digital, is going after theinfrastructure.andP;  At the moment, HP has a clear advantage over IBM in severalareas.andP;  IBM is still muddling along with multiple SAA platforms, and has notclearly articulated its strategy for AIX, let alone introduced products.andP;  IBMwill, however, have a solid integrated office offering by the latter half ofthe decade.andM;Digital's primary strengths are its Compound Document Architecture (CDA) andits coherent strategy of comparable Network Applications Support (NAS)services across VMS and Ultrix.andP;  However, Digital hasn't yet validated thestrategy with an integrated set of products.andP;  And the fledgling clientsoftware for All-In-1 has a way to go before it can compete with NewWave'sfunctionality and ease of use.andM;When you talk to HP about Fortune 500 accounts, the problem seems to begetting in the door (past the inevitable Digital VAXs and a cacophony of IBMsystems), not staying in once the presence is established.andP;  We see HP usingNewWave and NewWave Office as a way to get in that door, a first step that HPhopes will quietly lead to its becoming a pervasive business environment andcommunications platform.andP;  Using the desktop/ user as a design center mayprove to be a key factor in HP's success.andP;  Easy access to enterprise-wideinformation and analysis/decision-making tools for the user combined withhelp in control and security issues for MIS makes for a happy customer.andM;We fully expect to see multiple object management models in the industry, atleast for the next five years or so.andP;  Existing models will probably notconverge on a true standard until the mid-to late '90s.andP;  In the office space,primary contenders will be HP/OMG, IBM, and Microsoft.andP;  HP and the OMG may,in fact, represent two different models, depending on what the OMG developsand whether HP concurs.) The message here is clear: Don't wait around for astandard before moving ahead.andP;  Make your bet, select a platform, and getstarted.andP;  Conduct pilots.andP;  Begin to build your class libraries, knowing thatmechanisms will exist to make any necessary underlying accommodations as astandard evolves.andM;HP has contributed a valuable perspective to the industry at this criticalpoint in its development-the need to focus on the end user and to solvecomplex business problems with ease and elegance.andP;  The decision to use objecttechnology was not an end in itself, but rather a means to the end.andP;  HP'ssolution is based on a commitment to a distributed, cooperative computingenvironment; an appealing desktop metaphor (ultimately customizable);interoperability between HP's proprietary, Unix, and other strategicoperating systems; a powerful RISC/Unix platform for commercial applications;and a strong set of tools for integrating both new and existing applications.andO;As other vendors catch up with HP in defining and implementing a similarcomputing strategy, HP must stay on the leading edge in product introductionsand develop a solid marketing effort to effectively communicate anddifferentiate its offerings.andM;HP is poised to give IBM and Digital a run for their money.andP;  As for winningthe competition to provide the enterprise communications backbone, successfor HP depends on the implementation of distributed NewWave, support forworkgroup computing, and the availability of a broad range of third-partytools and applications for the NewWave environment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
