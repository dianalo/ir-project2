The bomb apparently exploded in Erin Bower's hand after she tookthe pump-type container from a shelf at a K mart store Mondaynight, investigators said today.   The explosion blew off four fingers and half her left palm andinjured an eye and her abdomen, officials said. Methodist Hospitalspokesman David Richards said her doctor is ``cautiously optimisticof partial vision in that eye.''   None of the 50 other people in the store was seriously hurt.   Charles A. Petersen of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobaccoand Firearms, said the bomb apparently was electrically fired. ``Itwas a little more sophisticated than the average pipe bomb. It tooksome knowledge to construct it,'' he said.   Police said they have no suspects and no motive in the bombingbut were searching for two men seen leaving the store when theexplosion occurred.   Detective Sgt. Mike Kouns said the men did not appear to beconcerned about the bombing, unlike other customers. Investigatorsreleased composite sketches of two men based on descriptions fromstore employees, Kouns said.   Kouns said that police would question K mart employees who havebeen fired recently but that there was no immediate reason tobelieve a former worker was involved.   The store received no warning before the explosion, whichoccurred about an hour before closing, said Sheriff Joseph G.McAtee.   ``The store looks like everybody dropped whatever they werelooking at,'' said Scott Minier, a Sheriff's Department spokesman.``There's blood on the tile. The trash bag area is a mess. There isa blood and merchandise scattered all over.''   Minier said the bomb had a pressure-sensitive release.   ``It sounded like a pop,'' said a clerk, Judy Kiefer. ``Thefirst thing I heard was a child screaming. A lot of people weresaying, `Get out of here.'''   The girl's mother, Maurine Bower, 31, suffered a minor shrapnelinjury to one of her legs and fainted. She was treated at thehospital.   Louis M. Profeta, a medical student at Indiana University, wasshopping when the bomb exploded.   ``I saw the little girl, her clothes were on fire and the motherwas screaming. Both father and mother were covered in blood,''Profeta said. ``We rendered first aid and got the father and motheraway, then got her stabilized.''   The father, Kevin Bower, 31, was holding his youngest daughter,Megan, 1, at the time of the explosion.   The severed portion of Erin's hand was packed in ice and takento the hospital, but officials said it could not be reattached.   ``She still has her thumb and about half of the palm of herhand,'' said Barbara McGraw, a hospital spokeswoman.   Authorities brought in dogs to sniff out more explosives. Nonewas found.   Other K mart stores in the Indianapolis area planned to takeprecautions as a result of the bombing, Minier said.
