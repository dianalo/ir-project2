The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed the penalties after a six-month investigation, which was spurred by complaints by the United Paperworkers Union. OSHA said it found 535 violations, including 241 violations of health and safety standards, with nearly all of those violations involving conditions that pose a threat of serious physical harm or death to workers.    The mill, the largest paper mill in Maine, produces bleached pulp and coated and uncoated paper. Boise Cascade is based in Boise, Idaho.    Alan McMillan, acting assistant secretary of labor for OSHA, said the company showed &quot;a substantial disregard . . . for the safety and health of its employees&quot; at the mill. Boise Cascade has been cited by the agency in the past for similar violations at the Maine mill as well as at other facilities. Many of the hazardous conditions at the mill had been identified by the company's own safety audits, but hadn't been corrected when OSHA inspected it, Mr. McMillan said.    Several of the conditions resulted in worker injuries, John Miles, OSHA regional administrator, said. The charges included allegations of 322 willful violations, including failure to record injuries and illnesses; unsafe operation of industrial trucks; and failure to properly guard electrical equipment or to adequately guard power-transmission apparatus such as chains, belts, pulleys and gears, or to properly guard platforms, runways or floors above or near dangerous equipment.    The willful violations also included failure to provide respiratory protection for workers responding to or evacuating from emergencies involving hazardous air contaminants, the agency said.    Boise Cascade has 15 working days to contest the citations and proposed penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.    In Boise, a spokesman for Boise Cascade said the company is reviewing the OSHA allegations on a one-by-one basis and will decide later whether to contest any of the allegations. </TEXT></DOC>
