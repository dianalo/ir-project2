Subpart A of Section III (``Drilling Fluid Toxicity Test'') discusses theproposed analytical method for determining the toxicity of drilling fluids.The discussion summarizes major industry comments on reliability and variabilityof the proposed toxicity test method and presents the Agency's plans forfurther evaluation of the test method. In Subpart B of Section II (``Discharge of Oil in Water-Based Fluids''),the Agency presents new information relating to its proposal to prohibitthe discharge of detectable amounts of diesel oil in drilling fluids anddrill cuttings. Industry commenters have argued that the discharge of dieseloil should not be prohibited because diesel oil is the most effective agentfor use in freeing stuck drill pipe. The discussion summarizes three studiesof the relative effectiveness of diesel oil and mineral oil for freeingstuck pipe (the 1983-1984 API Survey, the 1986 Offshore Operators CommitteeSurvey and the 1986-1987 EPA/API Diesel Pill Monitoring Program). It alsopresents and explains the Agency's renewed determination, in light of thisnew data, that the proposed prohibition on the discharge of diesel oilin detectable amounts continues to be appropriate for the BAT and NSPSlevels of control. Subpart C of Section II (``Analytical Method for OilDetection'') and Appendix A of this notice present a proposed modificationto the originally proposed analytical method for the detection of dieseloil in drilling fluids and drill cuttings. In Subpart D of Section II (``Metals Limitations''), the Agency is presentingtwo sets of mercury and cadmium effluent limitations that may be applicableto discharged drilling fluids. The Agency formulated a second set of effluentlimitations for mercury and cadmium based upon information submitted bycommenters in response to the set of effluent limitations presented anddiscussed in the proposed regulations. Economic and costing issues are presented in Sections III and IV of Part1. The Agency has recosted compliance with the proposed BAT and NSPS regulationsgoverning the discharge of drilling fluids and drill cuttings based uponnew technical and cost information. Section III summarizes the changesto the costing information and assumptions. Section IV presents a summaryof the economic impact analysis revised according to the new informationand assumptions. Under the subpart of Section III titled ``Toxicity Failure Rate for DrillingFluids,'' the Agency presents new data and preliminary conclusions concerningindustry's expected rate of failure of the proposed toxicity limitation(30,000 ppm suspended particulate phase basis) by drilling fluids thatcontain no added oil. This discussion also includes the Agency's revisedestimate of the annual industry cost of compliance with the toxicity limitationfor drilling fluids.The remaining subparts of Section III present updated or refined informationthat affects various factors used in estimating annual compliance costs.The affected factors are the estimate of the number of wells to be drilledoffshore per year, model well characteristics, transportation and disposalon shore of drilling wastes that do not comply with the proposed limitationsand standards, the frequency of use of oil based muds as opposed to waterbased muds, the cost differential between diesel oil and mineral oil, pollutantreduction estimates, expected failure rates for the static sheen test andmonitoring costs. Utilizing the new information and assumptions presented in Section III,Section IV summarizes the revised industry profile, economic impacts andother economic information concerning the proposed BAT and NSPS controlson drilling fluids and drill cuttings. Section IV also explains the Agency'spreliminary conclusion that despite overall higher costs since proposal,the revised estimates of cost are economically achievable. Finally, Section V summarizes a literature search concerning mercury andcadmium in barite, a constituent of drilling fluids, and the environmentalconsequences of the discharge of drilling fluids containing barite. SectionV concludes with the Agency's evaluation of several computer models thathave potential application in the prediction of dispersion of dischargeddrilling wastes and produced water. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Part 2</ITAG>Part 2 of today's notice presents new information on the performance, costsand applicability of certain thermal technologies and solvent extractiontechnologies for treating drilling fluids and drill cuttings to reducetheir oil content. Based on this information, the agency has begun to consideran oil content limitation of up to 1% by weight, whole sample basis, governingthe discharge of drill cuttings wastes at the BAT and NSPS levels of control.Sections I through III of Part 2 summarize the Agency's preliminary determinationsregarding the applicability of an oil content limitation to drilling wastestreams, discuss the regulatory background giving rise to EPA's investigationof this regulatory option, and present an overview of the thermal distillation,thermal oxidation and solvent extraction treatment technologies that areunder review by the Agency.Section IV of Part 2 describes these technologies in greater detail. SectionV discusses in greater detail the potential applicability of these technologiesto drill cuttings and drilling fluids, concluding that the technologiesappear suitable as the basis for regulation of drill cuttings but not drillingfluids. Section VI presents preliminary estimates of pollutant reductionsand the costs associated with treatment of drill cuttings and drillingfluids using these technologies. Section VII presents performance datafor one variety of the thermal distillation technology. Section VIII estimatesthe quantities of drill cuttings and water-based drilling fluids that wouldnot meet an oil content limitation of 1% or less. Section IX presents EPA'spreliminary conclusion that the revised analytical method presented inAppendix A is appropriate for quantification of oil content of drill cuttingsand drilling fluids. Section X requests comment on issues pertaining todevelopment of BAT and NSPS oil content controls for drill cuttings. The Agency is inviting comment only on the information presented todayand regulatory approaches relevant to BAT and NSPS effluent limitationsfor the drilling fluids and drill cuttings waste streams, and not on otheraspects of the August 26, 1985 proposed rule. The Agency intends, in the next several months to issue an additional <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice related to this rulemaking for the drillingfluids and drill cuttings waste streams. The topics of the future noticeare expected to include: Reproposal of BCT effluent limitations guidelines,results and conclusions from the drilling fluids toxicity test variabilitystudy (mentioned in Section II of Part I of today's notice), and otherdata or options that have not been addressed in <T4>Federal Register </T4>notices prior to that time. <ITAG tagnum="84">Part 1 </ITAG>I. Summary of Proposed Regulations On August 26, 1985, EPA proposed regulations to control the discharge ofwastewater pollutants from the offshore oil and gas extraction industry,a subcategory of the oil and gas extraction category (50 FR 34592) (the``1985 proposal''). the proposed regulations included NSPS and effluentlimitations guidelines based upon BAT and BCT. The proposed regulationsalso included an amendment to the BPT definition of ``no discharge of freeoil.'' The waste streams covered by the proposed regulations were producedwater, drilling fluids, drill cuttings, deck drainage, well treatment fluids,produced sand and sanitary and domestic wastes. The notice of proposed rulemaking and the supporting rulemaking recordfully explain the proposal for all of the waste streams. For the purposesof this part of today's notice, a summary of the proposed regulations regardingonly drilling fluids and drill cuttings is contained below. <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Drilling Fluids </ITAG><T3>1. BAT. </T3>The proposed BAT regulations for drilling fluids wouldprohibit the discharge of free oil as measured by the static sheen test.The static sheen test would provide for a determination of the presenceof free oil <T3>prior </T3>to discharge. The static sheen test method was includedin the proposed regulations as an appendix (50 FR 34627). The pollutantparameter free oil was proposed to be regulated as a BAT ``indicator''pollutant for control of the discharge of priority pollutants based uponinformation gathered on the concentration of priority pollutants in bothdrilling fluids and the specific additives used in the drilling fluid formulations.The parameter free oil is proposed to be used as an indicator pollutantfor priority pollutants because it would be technologically infeasibleto develop effluent limitations for all of the individual priority pollutants.The priority pollutants that would be controlled include benzene, toluene,ethylbenzene and naphthalene. The Agency has determined that the prohibitionon the discharge of free oil as measured by the proposed static sheen testmethod would result in BAT-level control for the toxics of concern in drillingwastes. The proposed ``no discharge of free oil'' limitation differs from the current40 CFR Part 435 requirement (BPT) that is based upon the application ofbest practicable control technology currently available (BPT). The currentBPT requirement prohibits the discharge of free oil that would ``causea film or sheen upon or a discoloration on the surface of the water oradjoining shorelines or cause a sludge or emulsion to be deposited beneaththe surface of the water or upon adjoining shorelines''. 40 CFR 435.11(d).The compliance monitoring procedure is a visual inspection of the receivingwater <T3>after </T3>discharge. The BPT limitation of ``no discharge of free oil'' was originally intendedto prohibit the discharge of drilling wastes that, when discharged, wouldcause a sheen on the receiving water. This limitation and the current definitionwere established to be consistent with the oil discharge provisions ofsection 311 of the Clean Water Act. The Agency did not intend that dischargeddrilling fluids be considered ``sludge''. For this reason, the Agency proposedin the August 26, 1985, notice to amend the current definition for thepurposes of BPT, BAT, BCT and NSPS by excluding language that prohibitsthe deposition of sludge beneath the surface of the receiving water. Thiswould allow the discharge of drilling fluids, provided that other effluentlimitations are met. The proposed regulations would also prohibit the discharge of diesel oilin detectable amounts. The analytical method for detection of diesel oilwas included in the proposed regulations as an appendix (50 FR 34628).The pollutant parameter diesel oil was also proposed to be regulated asa BAT ``indicator'' pollutant for control of the discharge of prioritypollutants contained in diesel oil. In the preamble to the 1985 proposed regulations, the Agency recognizedthat diesel oil should be regulated at the BAT level because it containstoxic organic pollutants. Diesel oil was proposed to be designated an indicatorpollutant for the BAT and NSPS levels to control the amounts of the individualtoxic organic pollutants that it contains. The listed priority pollutantsfound in various diesel oils can include, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene,naphthalene, phenanthrene, fluorene, and phenol. Diesel oil may containfrom 20 to 60 percent by volume aromatic hydrocarbons. The aromatic hydrocarbons,such as benzenes, naphthalenes, and phenanthrenes, constitute the moretoxic components of petroleum products such as diesel oil. Diesel oil alsocontains a number of nonconventional pollutants, including polynucleararomatic hydrocarbons such as methylnaphthalene, dimethylnaphthalene, methylphenanthrene,and other alkylated forms of each of the listed toxic pollutants. Because ``diesel oil'' is neither a listed toxic pollutant nor a listedconventional pollutant it is non-conventional pollutant. The parameterdiesel oil is used as an indicator for the toxic organic pollutants thatit is composed of because it would be technologically infeasible to developeffluent limitations for all of the individual toxic organic pollutants.The Agency has determined that control of these toxic organic pollutantsby the regulation of ``diesel oil'' as proposed represents BAT-level ofcontrol of the toxics of concern. The proposed regulations would also limit the toxicity of discharged drillingfluids with a 96-hour LC50 toxicity limitation. The LC50 limitation proposedis 3.0 percent by volume of the diluted suspended particulate phase, asa minimum (no single analysis to exceed). The analytical method for determiningthe 96-hour LC50 toxicity is a bioassay method that was also included inthe proposed regulations as an appendix (50 FR 34631). The purpose of theLC50 limitation is to reduce the levels of toxic constituents in drillingfluid discharges, including additives such as oil or lubricity agents andsome of the numerous specialty additives that may contribute significantlyto the toxicity of the drilling fluids. The proposed regulations would also prohibit the discharge of oil-baseddrilling fluids. This limitation continues the effective prohibition onthe discharge of oil-based drilling fluids that results from the BPT requirementof ``no discharge of free oil''. The oil present in such fluids would serveas an ``indicator'' pollutant to control the discharge of priority pollutantscontained in the oils added to or present in oil-based drilling fluidsat the BAT level of control. The priority pollutants that would be controlledinclude benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and naphthalene. The Agency hasdetermined that the prohibition on the discharge of oil-based drillingfluids would result in BAT-level control for the toxics of concern in thesedrilling wastes. The proposed regulations would also limit the amounts of mercury and cadmiumthat are in discharged drilling fluids. The proposed effluent limitationsfor mercury and cadmium are 1 mg/kg each, dry weight basis in the wholedrilling fluid, as a maximum limitation (<T3>i.e., </T3>no single analysis to exceed). These limitations would applyto the discharged drilling fluid. Compliance with these limitations wouldlikely be accomplished by control of these priority pollutants in the baritecomponent of the drilling fluid. <T3>2. BCT. </T3>As stated previously, today's notice presents informationfor the purpose of promulating BAT and NSPS regulations from drilling fluidsand drill cuttings. The August 26, 1985, proposal did include a BCT limitationwhich would prohibit the discharge of free oil in these wastes as measuredby the static sheen test. The static sheen test method was included inthe proposed regulations as an appendix (50 FR 34627). The pollutant parameterfree oil was proposed to be regulated at the BCT level of control. However,with the exception of free oil, BCT requirements for drilling fluids werereserved for future rulemaking until after the promulgation of the generalBCT methodology. The general BCT methodology was subsequently promulgatedby EPA on July 9, 1986 (51 FR 24974). The Agency intends to issue a separate<T4>Federal Register </T4>notice to propose BCT for drilling fluids (anddrill cuttings). Subsequently, the Agency will issue final BAT, BCT andNSPS regulations for drilling fluids and drill cuttings. <T3>3. NSPS. </T3>The proposed regulations would establish NSPS limitationsfor free oil, oil-based drilling fluids, diesel oil, toxicity, mercuryand cadmium as described above for the BAT level of control.The proposed regulations included definitions for certain terms used toclassify a ``new source'' for the offshore subcategory. These definitionswould facilitate the application of the term ``new source'' to activitiescovered in this subcategory, including mobile and fixed exploratory anddevelopment drilling operations as well as production operations. Referto the 1985 proposal notice for a detailed discussion of the Agency's intentin applying the new source designation. Comments were received regardingthe proposed new source definition, but the Agency is not presenting anychanges to the proposed definition at this time.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Drill Cuttings</ITAG><T3>1. BAT</T3>. The proposed BAT regulations for drill cuttings wouldprohibit the discharge of free oil as measured by the static sheen test.The pollutant parameter free oil was proposed to be regulated as an ``indicator''pollutant at the BAT level for control of the discharge of priority pollutantsin the oil contained in drill cutttings. Free oil is proposed to be usedas an indicator pollutant for the priority pollutants contained in theoil because it would be technologically infeasible to develop effluentlimitations for each of the individual priority pollutants contained infree oil. The priority pollutants that would be controlled include benzene,toluene, ethylbenzene and naphthalene. The Agency has determined that theprohibition on the discharge of free oil would result in BAT-level controlfor the toxics of concern in drilling wastes.In addition, the proposed regulations would prohibit the discharge of dieseloil in detectable amounts. The pollutant parameter diesel oil was alsoproposed to be regulated as an ``indicator'' pollutant at the BAT levelfor control of the discharge of priority pollutants in diesel oil containedin drill cuttings. Diesel oil is proposed to be used as an indicator pollutantfor the priority pollutants contained in diesel oil because it would betechnologically infeasible to develop effluent limitations for all of theindividual priority pollutants. The priority and non-conventional pollutantsto be controlled by the use of diesel oil as an indicator pollutant arethe same as that discussed above for the BAT-level of control for drillingfluids.The proposed regulations would also prohibit the discharge of drill cuttingscontaining oil-based drilling fluids. As noted previously, such fluidswould serve as ``indicator'' pollutants to control, at the BAT level, thedischarge of priority pollutants contained in the oils added to or presentin oil-based drilling fluids and transferred to drill cuttings. <T3>2. BCT</T3>. The August 26, 1985 proposed BCT regulations for drillcuttings would prohibit the discharge of free oil as measured by the staticsheen test. The pollutant parameter free oil was proposed to be regulatedat the BCT level for control of the discharge of oil contained in drillcuttings.With the exception of free oil, BCT requirements for drill cuttings werereserved for future rulemaking until after the promulgation of the generalBCT methodology. The general BCT methodology was subsequently promulgatedby EPA on July 9, 1986 (51 FR 24974). The Agency intends to propose BCTin a separate <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice for drill cuttings (and drilling fluids).<T3>3. NSPS.</T3> The proposed regulations would establish NSPS limitationsfor the discharge of drill cuttings containing free oil, drill cuttingsassociated with oil-based drilling fluids, and drill cuttings that containdiesel oil as described above.II. New Technical Information Related To the Proposed BAT/NSPS regulations<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Drilling Fluid Toxicity Test</ITAG>The proposed BAT and NSPS regulations would regulate drilling fluids byspecifying a limit on the toxicity of the discharged fluid as determinedthrough laboratory testing of samples of the fluids. The testing wouldconsist of exposing test organisms to solutions containing different concentrationsof the fluids. The test results would be used to determine concentrationvalues lethal to 50% of the test organisms, <T3>i.e.,</T3> LC50 values. These LC50 values would be used to determinecompliance with the toxicity limitation. The proposed BAT and NSPS regulationscontain a limitation on the LC50 of discharged drilling fluids of 3.0 percentby volume of the diluted suspended particulate phase (``SPP basis'') ofthe drilling fluids wastestream.EPA accounted for variation in drilling fluid toxicity testing during theprocess of establishing the proposed toxicity limitation. The Agency proposeda limitation equal to the measured toxicity of the most toxic of the eightgeneric water-based drilling fluids. (The eight generic drilling fluidsare identified in Appendix B of the August 26, 1985 proposal; 40 FR 34632.)Test method variability and analytical variability were accounted for inthe proposed limitation because they were inherent components of the proceduresused by the Agency in performing the toxicity testing and subsequent calculations.No explicit additional allowances for variation in the test method (intra-or inter-laboratory variability) or variation in ``batches'' of dischargedwaste material were used in establishing the proposed toxicity limitation.Moreover, the Agency has not historically provided for such additionalallowances in the development of effluent limitations. EPA has received numerous comments on the proposed toxicity limitation.In particular, industry commented that the toxicity limits may be failedas a result of intra- and inter-laboratory variability in test results.One existing source of data for use in evaluating inter-laboratory variabilityis the study that was performed to aid the Agency in the selection of laboratoriesto conduct toxicity tests for EPA under contract. This data collectioneffort was part of an Agency ``invitation for bid'' (IFB) contracting processto provide acute toxicity test method performance information by laboratoriesattempting to qualify for contract analytical services to the Agency.A detailed description of the statistical analysis on the IFB data is describedin a paper titled ``Toxicity Testing of Drilling Fluids: Assessing LaboratoryPerformance and Variability'' (R.C. Bailey, B.P. Eynon), which is availablein the record for this rulemaking. The Bailey-Eynon assessment also evaluatesintra-laboratory variability using additional data from the EPA Gulf BreezeLaboratory. The American Petroleum Institute (API) has criticized the Bailey-Eynonassessment in a paper titled ``Variability in Drilling Fluid Toxicity Tests''(J.E. O'Reilly, L.R. LaMotte). This paper also is included in the rulemakingrecord.In order to draw final conclusions concerning variability of toxicity testresults, the Agency is currently conducting a further evaluation of thedrilling fluid toxicity test. This study will estimate intra- and inter-laboratoryvariability in the test results. It will also assess differences in intra-and inter-laboratory variation of estimated toxicity between a drillingmud and that same batch of drilling mud with oil added. The study willrequire each laboratory to conduct individual range-finding tests and tocalculate LC50's. An intra-laboratory variability analysis will be basedupon data from laboratories with levels of experience ranging from someexperience to highly experienced. The study will not include estimatesof variability resulting from repeated measurements on different ``batches''of the same mud since this information is not needed to evaluate the drillingfluid toxicity test.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Discharge of Oil in Water-Based Drilling Fluids</ITAG>Water-based drilling fluids used in offshore drilling operations sometimeshave oil, either diesel oil or mineral oil, added to them. Drilling fluidsmay also contain entained formation hydrocarbons. (The discharge of oil-baseddrilling fluids would be prohibited under the proposed regulation).Oil can be used to improve the lubricating properties of a water-basedmud system and as an aid in freeing drill pipe that has become stuck downholeduring the drilling operation. Although diesel oil is often the most readilyavailable oil at a drilling site, mineral oils have had a great deal ofuse recently for these purposes. When oil is used an an aid in freeingstuck drill pipe, a standard technique is to pump a slug or ``pill'' ofoil or oil-based fluid down the drill string and ``spot'' it in the annulusarea where the pipe is stuck. After use, the pill may be removed from thebulk mud system and disposed of separately. Even if the pill is recovered,residual oil from the pill can mix with the remainder of the mud system.In recent years, research sponsored by both industry and government hasshown that the presence of petroleum hydrocarbons in drilling fluid contributessignificantly to its toxicidy. Diesel oil is a complex mixture of petroleumhydrocarbons. It is known to be highly toxic to marine organisms and tocontain toxic and nonconventional pollutants. There is evidence that dieseloil contributes significantly to the toxicity of drilling fluids that containit. Toxicity data collected to date have shown that water-based muds containingdiesel oil are substantially more toxic than muds without diesel. Mineraloil, which is available to serve the same operational requirements as dieseloil, has been shown to be a less toxic alternative to diesel oil. As aresult, EPA has proposed a prohibition on the discharge of water-baseddrilling muds containing diesel oil and has encouraged the substitutionof mineral oil for diesel oilThe use of mineral oil instead of diesel oil as an additive in water-baseddrilling fluids will reduce the quantity of toxic and nonconventional organicpollutants that are present in a drilling fluid, as compared to the quantityof these pollutants present when using diesel oil as an additive. Mineraloils, with their lower aromatic hydrocarbon content and lower toxicity,contain lower concentrations of toxic pollutants than do diesel oils.The proposed regulations would prohibit the discharge of diesel oil indetectable amounts in drilling fluid waste streams. The Agency selectedthe pollutant ``diesel oil'' as an ``indicator'' of the listed toxic pollutantspresent in diesel oil that are controlled through compliance with the effluentlimitation, <T3>i.e.</T3>, no discharge. The technology basis for this limitation isproduct substitution of less toxic mineral oil for diesel oil.As discussed in the preamble to the proposed regulations, the reason forprohibiting diesel discharges is to reduce the discharge of priority toxicand nonconventional organic pollutants known to be present in diesel oils.The types and levels of these pollutants present in diesel oils have recentlybeen documented in a study sponsored by the Offshore Operators CommitteeOOC). The laboratory study was conducted to examine the chemical characteristicsof selected diesel and mineral oils. The findings are presented in twocomprehensive reports prepared by Battelle New England Marine ResearchLaboratory. These studies were made available to the Agency by the industryand are available in the rulemaking record.Some typical methods for compliance with the diesel oil limitation are:(1) Use of product substitutes such as low toxicity mineral oils for spottingand lubricity purposes; and (2) use of diesel oil for spotting and/or lubricitypurposes and transporting the used mud system to shore for proper treatment,disposal or reuse.The industry commenters on the proposed regulations argued that dieseloil is the most effective agent for use in spotting fluids and that theuse and discharge of diesel oil for this purpose should be allowed by theregulations. The industry attempted to demonstrate this preference fordiesel oil in spotting fluids by providing EPA with the results of theindustry-sponsored surveys discussed below. The industry also proposedto EPA that a program of limited duration be undertaken to determine theefficiency of recovering a diesel pill so that the discharge of dieseloil would be minimized, if not eliminated, when the used mud system isdischarged to the ocean.<T3>1. American Petroleum Institute Drilling Fluids Survey.</T3> In 1984the American Petroleum Institute (API) conducted a survey among sixteenoffshore oil operators in the Guld of Mexico to obtain information on theuse of diesel and mineral oils in water-based drilling fluids for the year1983. Because the number of mineral oil applications in 1983 was small,API conducted a limited additional survey to obtain more data on experiencewith mineral oil pills in 1984.These survey data presented by API indicate that mineral oil is more commonlyused as a lubricant, while diesel oil is more commonly used for spottingpurposes. Hydrocarbons (diesel or mineral oil) were added for lubricityto 12% of the 548 wells included in the survey. For 8% of the wells (44wells), mineral oil was added, while for 4% of the wells (21 wells), dieseloil was added. For those drilling muds to which lubricity hydorcarbon wasadded, typically 3 percent (by volume) of the mud formulation was composedof hydrocarbon additive.2. <T3>Offshore Operators Committee Spotting Fluid Survey.</T3> Most industryrepresentatives consider mineral oil to be adequate for use as a lubricityagent but believe diesel oil to be a superior materials for freeing stuckpipe. In support of this position, industry has provided the Agency withthe results of a retrospective survey comparing the success rates of dieseloil and mineral oil in freeing stuck pipe. This project was conducted in1986 by the Offshore Operator's Committee (OOC) and covered the years 1983to 1986.The study examined information from 2,287 wells drilled in the Gulf ofMexico during that time period. Survey forms were distributed to operatorswho were asked to specify the number of wells drilled with water-basedmud for each year covered by the survey and to supply certain informationon each stuck pipe event where an oil-based spotting fluid was used. TheAPI survey form asked for the data the event took place, the time intervalbetween sticking and spotting activities, the depth at which the stuckpipe incident occurred, the based oil used in the spotting fluid, whetherthe hole was straight or directional, and whether the pill was successfulin freeing the pipe.Participants included twelve major oil companies and accounted for morethan half of the offshore wells drilled during this period. Since someof these companies have more than one operating division, a total of sixteensurvey response were received.Of 2,287 wells surveyed that were drilled with water-based mud, 506 stuckpipe incidents were identified in which the operator chose to use an oiladditive to attempt to free stuck pipe. Diesel oil pills were reportedlysuccessful 52.7% of the time and mineral oil pills were successful 32.7%of the time in freeing stuck pipe, as shown in the following table:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s10,8,8,8</C><T4>OOC Spotting Fluid Survey Results</T4><H1>Spotting fluid</H1><H1>Number incidents fluid used</H1><H1>Number incidents pipe freed</H1><H1>Success rate (percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Diesel <D>298</D><D>157</D><D>52.7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mineral <D>208</D><D>68</D><D>32.7</D></ITAG></ITAG>Numerous other factors could impact the success of a pill in addition tothe base oil. For example, Love (1983) determined that the chance of freeingstuck pipe in 113 documented cases and the potential success of such operationswere related to specific conditions at each well. Success decreased withincreasing well angle, mud weight, amount of open hole, API fluid lossof the mud, and bottom-hole-assembly length. The chances of success droppedoff substantially when a numeric index calculated from the above factorsexceeded a certain level.In addition to the above factors, Love found that pill additive packages(<T3>e.g.,</T3> surfactants, emulsifiers, etc.), rheological propertiesof the mud, time until spotting, site-specific geological characteristics,and operator experience were likely to affect the success of a spottingoperation.The OOC examined four of these factors in their study: base oil, time untilspotting, depth of spot, and type of well (straight or deviated). Resultsindicated that reducing the length of time until the spot was applied improvedthe chance of success dramatically for diesel pills. A similar but apparentlyless dramatic trend was observed for mineral oil pills. The diesel oilsuccess rate was 61% if the pill was spotted in less than 5 hours. Therate dropped of 41% if the spotting time until spot exceeded 10 hours.The mineral oil success rate was 35% if the pill was spotting in less than5 hours; the rate dropped to 31% if the time until the spot exceeded 10hours.Other factors examined by OOC appeared to have less impact on success forfreeing stuck drill pipe. Both diesel and mineral oil showed higher successrates in straight rather than in directional or deviated wells, with dieseloil maintaining its reported edge over mineral oil by about the same percentagein each type of well. No trend was observed between depth of spot and successrates for diesel or mineral oil pills.The OOC survey data showed that success rate with mineral oil pills variedconsiderably among operators. The data seemed to indicate that greaterexperience with mineral oil usage leads to considerably higher successrates than the reported average. The five operators that reported usingmineral oil pills for more than 90% of their stuck pipe incidents experiencedan average 42% success rate with such pills.Some of the operators with greater mineral pill usage rates achieved extremelyhigh success rates, which were comparable to the highest diesel pill successrates. The three highest success rates among operators using mineral pillswere 58%, 60%, 75%. The three highest success rates among operators usingdiesel pills were 60%, 60%, and 64%. Despite the industry's claim that diesel pills are more effective thanmineral pills, the study did show that mineral oil was used by operatorsin 41% of the stuck pipe incidents. Of the 506 incidents in the OOC study,298 (or 59%) were treated with a diesel pill, while 208 (41%) were treatedwith a mineral pill. For some operators, mineral oil was the material ofchoice. Three operators (out of 16) used mineral pills exclusively. TheAgency concludes that during the period of this study: (1) Mineral oilwas in common use by operators in the Gulf of Mexico; (2) mineral oil isan available alternative to the use of diesel oil; and (3) success ratescomparable to those with diesel oil can be achieved with mineral oil. <T3>3. EPA/API Diesel Pill Monitoring Program (DPMP). </T3>In responseto the proposed prohibition on the discharge of diesel oil, the industryrequested that the discharge of diesel oil be allowed when diesel oil isthe residual oil left in the bulk mud system following the use of a dieselpill and subsequent pill recovery techniques. Since neither the industrynor the Agency had sufficient information on the effectiveness of pillrecovery, the Agency decided to participate with the industry in a testprogram to determine whether diesel oil can be effectively removed froma mud system after use of diesel-based pills. In an effort to evaluate the effectiveness of diesel pill recovery techniquesand to gather information on the extent to which any residual diesel oilcontaminates the bulk mud system, EPA's Industrial Technology Division,EPA Regions IV and VI, and EPA's Environmental Research Laboratory in GulfBreeze, FL conducted the Diesel Pill Monitoring Program (DPMP) in cooperationwith the API. The program involved the collection and analysis of samplesfrom active mud systems prior to use and after recovery of a diesel oilbased pill. a. DPMP Objectives. The objectives of the DPMP were to evaluate the efficiencyof diesel pill recovery and to determine the effectiveness of the recoverypractice by measuring the toxicity and diesel content of the mud systembefore and after pill recovery. The major parameters used to establish the efficiency of diesel oil recoveryincluded the toxicity and diesel content of muds both before and aftera pill is spotted, the volume of material added and removed from the mudsystem (recovered pill and buffer material), the location and type of wellbeing drilled, and the type and rheological properties of the mud and pillbeing used. This information was to be analyzed and used to determine theefficiency of diesel recovery and the acceptability of the remainder ofthe mud system for discharge. b. Program Description. The DPMP required an operator who used a dieselpill and intended to discharge the drilling muds to recover the dieselpill plus at least 50 barrels of mud that surfaced from downhole both beforeand after the pill, or as much as necessary until no visible oil was detected.The recovered pill and buffer material could not be discharged and hadto be transported to shore for either disposal or reuse. The federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico were chosen for this study becauseof the large number and diversity of drilling operations. The DPMP wasimplemented as part of the Agency's general NPDES permit for oil and gasoperations in the Gulf of Mexico (Permit No. GMG 280000). The permit, whichwas published by EPA Regions IV and VI in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on July 9, 1986 (51 FR 24897), prohibited thedischarge of water-based drilling muds containing diesel oil unless: (1)The diesel oil was added only for the purpose of attempting to free stuckpipe, (2) the diesel pill and contaminated mud (buffer) were recoveredand not discharged, and (3) the permittee participated in and compliedwith the written instructions of the DPMP. The program officially startedin July 1986 with the issuance of the general permit, but some operatorsbegan participating in November 1985. The program ended as part of thepermit requirement on September 30, 1987. Some permittees elected not to participate in the DPMP on a well-by-wellbasis. If a permittee used a diesel pill and did not participate in theprogram, then all waste mud and cuttings generated after introduction ofthe pill were to be transported to shore for disposal, as required by thegeneral permit. If permittees used a mineral oil or non-hydrocarbon basedpill instead of diesel oil to free stuck pipe, then they were allowed todischarge waste mud and cuttings without participating in the DPMP, providedthat all other permit conditions (<T3>e.g., </T3>toxicity limitation, no discharge of free oil) were met.For those operators that did participate in the program, the DPMP establishedconditions for pill recovery, toxicity and chemical testing, and monitoringto generate data on the effectiveness of current recovery techniques. DPMPparticipants were required to meet all permit limitations with the exceptionof the prohibition on the discharge of diesel oil. Discharge of mud containingdiesel oil was allowed if used only for freeing stuck pipe and if provisionsof the DPMP were followed. Also, for permit purposes, compliance with thetoxicity limitation was demonstrated by sampling the mud just prior tothe introduction of the pill. The end-of-well toxicity test was also conducted,but was used by EPA for information only, and not to determine compliancewith the permit. The procedures for conducting the sampling and analysis program are documentedin a program manual that contains detailed instructions for all participants.The program manual is included in the record for this rulemaking.The DPMP was managed by an Oversight Committee with members representingEPA's Industrial Technology Division and Regional Offices, EPA's EnvironmentalResearch Laboratory, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and API's Committeeon Environmental Conservation. The Oversight Committee carried out theplanning and development of the DPMP, met periodically to review laboratoryactivities and the information being gathered and analyses being performed,monitor the progress of the investigations, amend certain pill recoverytechniques and sampling/analytical procedures, and issue a final reporton the findings and conclusion of the DPMP.EPA's Environmental Reserach Laboratory, Office of Research and Development,in Gulf Breeze, FL acted as the quality review laboratory for the toxicitytesting part of this program. The Gulf Breeze Lab has been conducting researchactivities since 1976 to evaluate the potential impact of drilling fluidson the marine environment. The lab is experienced in handling and testingdrilling fluid samples, and was involved in developing the protocol forthe proposed Drilling Fluids Toxicity Test method (50 FR 34631). Thus,the Gulf Breeze Lab reviewed toxicity analyses generated during the DPMP,advised on data quality, and conducted analyses on duplicate samples.The participating drilling operators were required to conduct samplingactivities with prepackaged sampling kits whenever a diesel pill was usedto free stuck pipe. Samples were taken of the pill, the diesel oil usedto formulate the pill, and the active mud system before spotting and afterthe pill was recovered. Samples were shipped to a designated Central ControlLaboratory (CCL) which was responsible for managing the flow of samples,analyses, and information. The CCL monitored the performance of contractlaboratories and transmitted results to permittees and to EPA's SampleControl Center (SCC).The SCC is an Agency contractor that assists the Industrial TechnologyDivision with the tracking of samples, assignment and performance evaluationof analytical laboratories, and the compilation of analytical results forDivision projects. Thus, the SCC was assigned the task of monitoring thestatus of the DPMP for the Agency. The SCC was also responsible for maintaininga computerized data management system for all analytical information gatheredduring this program for Agency access and recordkeeping purposes, and forpreparing quarterly data compilations to the Oversight Committee.c. Diesel Pill Monitoring Program Findngs. The Agency has performed analysesof the diesel pill program information received to date. This encompassesinformation on 119 stuck pipe incidents that occurred from November 1985through September 1987. The Agency focused on analyses that would indicatethe amount of diesel oil recovered (<T3>i.e.</T3>, removed from the bulk drilling fluid system) based uponknown amounts introduced with the diesel pill formulation.The Agency first examined the amount of diesel oil remaining in the bulkmud system after pill recovery and its relationship to the size of thebuffer that was removed with the pill. According to the design of the pillrecovery technique, it was expected that an increase in buffer size wouldresult in higher diesel recover (<T3>i.e.</T3>, lower amounts of diesel oil remaining in the bulk mud system).Diesel oil recovery was determined as the difference between the amountof diesel oil reportedly added to the mud system and the amount measuredin the active system after two complete revolutions of the mud system followingpill recovery. The results of the analyses indicate that, for the timeperiod after the general NPDES permit for the Gulf of Mexico became effectivein July 1986, the median diesel oil recovery level was about 80 percent.The amount of diesel oil remaining in the bulk mud systems ranged fromless than one percent to more than 95 percent of the volume added, witha median level of almost 20 percent.The amount of diesel oil remaining in the system did not appear to correlatewith buffer size. Increasing the amount of buffer material collected hadlittle effect on the median recovery level.Next, the Agency evaluated DPMP data to determine if there were correlationsbetween measured diesel oil content and the acute toxicity (LC50) of drillingfluids. The Agency found that a distinct and rather dramatic relationshipdoes exist. At low diesel concentrations, acute toxicity was found to increaserapidly with increasing diesel content. The data clearly support previousfindings that diesel oil is a major contributor to mud toxicity. The findingthat the acute toxicity of drilling fluids is heavily influenced by theamount of diesel oil present supports the Agency's original proposal toprohibit the discharge of diesel oil in drilling wastes.The success rates for freeing stuck pipe for the DPMP and the OOC SpottingFluid Survey (see previous discussion) were compared. The diesel pill successrate from the DPMP was found to be 36 percent. This value was derived byconsidering all stuck pipe incidents that occurred during the DPMP, whichincluded multiple pills for some sticking incidents and multiple stickingincidents for some wells. The industry analysis of the OOC survey dataincluded consideration of multiple stuck pipe incidents per well but successrates were calculated by considering only the first pill per sticking incident.The Agency recalcuated the diesel pill success rate from the DPMP on thesame basis used by OOC in its survey. The resultant value is only a 40percent diesel oil success rate, compared to the reported 52.7 percentdiesel oil success rate from the OOC survey. It is not clear why the reporteddiesel pill success rates differ between these two studies. The DPMP datacast doubt upon the industry position regarding superiority of diesel oilover mineral oil in freeing stuck pipe.It should be noted that during the course of the DPMP the use of mineraloil pills for freeing stuck pipe in the Gulf of Mexico reportedly declined.Industry has stated that the DPMP became a distincentive for the use andfurther development of mineral oil pills. However, industry representativeshave noted that onsite recovery techniques would be essentially the samefor pills formulated with either diesel or mineral oil.Total costs for operators participating in the DPMP and transporting anddisposing of the pill and buffer material onshore were reported to averageabout $11,000 per spotting episode. Of that total, the costs of transportingthe recovered pill and buffer from the rig to the disposal site, cleaningtanks, and landfilling the waste material averaged approximately $8,000per episode.d. Conclusions on the Diesel Pill Monitoring Program. Based on analysesto date of information generated during the DPMP, the Agency believes thatuse of the pill recovery techniques implemented during the program doesnot result in recovery of sufficient amounts of the diesel pill and reductionof mud toxicity to acceptable levels for discharge of bulk mud systems.Mud systems for approximately one-half of all wells in the DPMP containedresidual diesel levels between one and five percent by weight after introductionof a diesel pill and subsequent pill recovery efforts. In addition, mudsystems for approximately 80 percent of the DPMP wells failed the proposed30,000 ppm LC50 limitation after pill recovery. Almost half that number(40 percent of the total) of the DPMP wells had water-based mud systemsthat contained residual diesel following pill recovery and showed LC50values of less than (more toxic than) 5,000 ppm.<T3>4. Conclusion on the Discharge of Diesel Oil</T3>. For the reasonsdiscussed above, the Agency believes that its proposed prohibition on thedischarge of diesel oil in detectable amounts is appropriate for the BATand NSPS levels of control. The technology basis for the prohibition onthe discharge of detectable amounts of diesel oil in drilling fluids anddrill cuttings is substitution of mineral oil for diesel oil and lubricityand spotting purposes. Alternatively, where offshore operators choose touse diesel oil in a mud system, many opeators have the option to transportused mud systems and associated cuttings to shore for proper treatmentor disposal.In comments submitted to the Agency on the August 26, 1985 proposed regulations,the American Petroleum Institute stated its agreement with EPA that satisfactorymineral oil substitutes are available for general mud lubricity applications,and that use of diesel oil for this purpose should be discontinued. APIalso maintained that, for use as a spotting fluid to free stuck drill pipe,mineral oil substitutes are not as effective as diesel in all cases. However,results of the surveys presented in this notice indicate that mineral oiladditives are available, are being used by offshore operators, and arecapable of being as effective as diesel in spotting fluid applications.The Agency solicits comments on all aspects of this discussion and thestudies used by the Agency to reconsider the proposed diesel dischargeprohibition. The Agency also solicits any additional relevant data on thisissue. The Agency will consider these data in the formulation of the finaleffluent limitations and standards for drilling fluids and drill cuttings.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Analytical Method for Diesel Oil Detection </ITAG>The August 26, 1985 <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice proposed a method for detecting the presenceof diesel oil in drilling fluids and drill cuttings waste streams. Themethod, based on retort distillation and gas chromatography, has subsequentlybeen modified based on experience gained during the conduct of the DieselPill Monitoring Program. The current version of Proposed Method 1651, ``OilContent and Diesel Oil in Drilling Muds and Drill Cuttings by Retort Gravimetryand GCFID'' is presented in Appendix A of this notice for review and comment.This method for determining the identity and concentration of diesel oilin drilling wastes has an estimated detection limit of 100 mg/kg. Dataon the precision and accuracy of the method have been generated and areincluded in the record for this rulemaking. Today's modified version of the diesel analytical method also includesa proposed method for determining the oil content of drilling wastes. Discussionon the Agency's intended use of oil content determinations is presentedin Part 2 of today's notice. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Metals Limitations </ITAG>The proposed BAT and NSPS regulations would limit the levels of mercuryand cadmium that could be present in discharged drilling fluids. The primarysource of these toxic metals is the barite component of drilling fluids.The August 26, 1985 proposal included proposed effluent limitations of1 mg/kg each of mercury and cadmium in the whole drilling fluid on a dryweight basis. The proposed effluent limitations would be maximum values(no single analysis to exceed). Upon review and consideration of the comments and additional informationreceived on this aspect of the proposed regulations, the Agency is consideringdifferent BAT and NSPS effluent limitations for control of mercury andcadmium levels in drilling fluids. The limitations being considered are1.5 mg/kg of mercury and 2.5 mg/kg of cadmium in the whole drilling fluidon a dry weight basis. These effluent limitations also would be maximum(no single sample to exceed) values. At proposal, the Agency estimated that mercury and cadmium limitationsof 1 mg/kg each would result in a price increase of about 15% for barite.Industry commenters argued that the proposed mercury and cadmium limitationswould result in a 65% increase in the price of barite that contains mercuryand cadmium at sufficiently low levels to allow for compliance with theeffluent limitations. The price increase would be due to increased demandfor such ``clean'' barite and additional costs in segregating and transportingsupplies of clean barite for offshore use. It was suggested that therealso may be a question about adequate sources and stocks of such ``clean''barite for use in offshore drilling. Industry commenters indicated thatsufficient supplies of barite containing no more than 3 mg/kg mercury and5 mg/kg cadmium are available for offshore use. The Agency's analysis ofindustry-supplied data indicates that there should be no price increasefor barite if barite containing mercury and cadmium at levels no higherthan 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively, could be used to formulate drillingfluids. The 1.5 mg/kg mercury and 2.5 mg/kg cadmium effluent limitations beingconsidered by the Agency are end of pipe limitations based upon the usein drilling fluids of: (1) Barite containing no more than 3 mg/kg mercuryand 5 mg/kg cadmium and (2) a typical barite content in drilling fluidof 50% barite by weight. If the barite content in the whole drilling fluidis 50%, the concentration of each metal in the whole drilling fluid wouldbe about one-half of its concentration in the stock barite. The Agency may establish the final BAT and NSPS effluent limitations equalto 1 mg/kg each of mercury and cadmium in the whole drilling fluid or equalto 1.5 mg/kg of mercury and 2.5 mg/kg of cadmium in the whole drillingfluid. The Agency may also establish the limitations at levels in the wholedrilling fluid that the Agency determines more accurately reflect the useof barite containing no more than 3 mg/kg of mercury and 5 mg/kg of cadmium.The Agency believes that either set of effluent limitations under considerationfor mercury and cadmium in whole drilling fluid is potentially appropriatefor the BAT and NSPS levels of control and that either set of limitationsis economically achievable. The Agency solicits comment on all aspects of the mercury and cadmium limitationsdiscussed here. In particular, the Agency solicits: (1) Data relating tothe availability of adequate supplies of barite which will provide forcompliance with particular metals limitations in discharged drilling fluids;(2) information about the appropriateness of its tentative conclusion thatthe use in drilling fluids of barite containing no more than 3 mg/kg mercuryof 5 mg/kg cadmium correlates properly with end of pipe limitations of1.5 mg/kg for mercury and 2.5 mg/kg for cadmium at the BAT and NSPS levelsof control (this includes data on the amounts and proportions of the baritecomponent used in actual drilling fluid formulations, the proportion ofdrilling fluid systems and volumes of actual drilling fluids that containbarite in greater or lesser proportions than the estimate of 50% by weightthat was used for the Agency's analysis, and data that would aid in theassessment of the changing proportion of the barite component of drillingfluid systems as the drilling fluid composition is modified during thedrilling of a well); and (3) data that would aid in discerning differencesin environmental effects between the effluent limitations under consideration.III. Changes to Costing Data and Assumptions for Estimates of EconomicImpacts The Agency has re-costed compliance with the proposed regulatory optionfor drilling fluids and drill cuttings based upon additional technicaland cost information provided in comments on the proposed regulation andadditional information collected by the Agency since proposal. The Agencyselected the year 1986 as the basis for presentation of the regulatorycosts and economic analysis discussed in this notice because 1986 is thelatest year for which sufficient actual costs and economic data are available.The following discussion summarizes the major and most of the minor changesto costing items and assumptions used in developing aggregate industrycompliance costs. The revised compliance costs were then used to performa revised economic impact analysis of the amended regulatory approach presentedin this section. The revised economic impact analysis is included in therulemaking record. A summary of the economic impact analysis is presentedin Section IV of this part of today's notice. The Agency solicits commenton these changes to the costing data and assumptions and on the revisedeconomic impact analysis. <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Toxicity Failure Rate for Water-Based Drilling Fluids </ITAG>The Agency has undertaken an analysis of data on water-based drilling fluidscollected by both EPA and the industry over the past two years to estimatefailure rates of the proposed toxicity limitation (30,000 ppm, suspendedparticulate phase basis) in order to better estimate the aggregate industrycompliance costs of the proposed regulatory option. These data includemeasured oil content and acute toxicity of field (used) muds. The Agency has categorized the information by ``data set''. The data setsare identified as follows: The first data set is field mud data collectedby API and presented to EPA in comments on the August 26, 1985 proposedregulations (``API 1''). The second data set is an extension of data collectionby API subsequent to API 1 and submitted to the Agency in October 1986(``API 2''). The third data set includes mud properties data, well identificationinformation, and analytical results for field muds collected during theDiesel Pill Monitoring Program (``DPMP'') from November 1985 through September1987. The fourth data set is field mud information generated by the industryand submitted to EPA Region VI for the alternative toxicity request (``ATR'')program under the NPDES permit for oil and gas operations in federal watersof the Gulf of Mexico (Permit No. GMG 280000). The fifth set of data isdischarge monitoring report (``DMR'') data that are being provided to EPARegion VI by the industry under the terms of the NPDES general permit foroil and gas operations in federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico.Mud data were grouped to represent three segments of the total populationof wells employing water-based mud systems. The segments included mud systemswith no added oil, oil added for lubricity, and oil added for spottingpurposes. Expected failure rates at the proposed LC50 limitation of 30,000ppm were estimated for each of the three segments and thus for the totalwell population. Compliance costs were then estimated based on productsubstitution and transport of muds to shore for disposal.Depending upon the individual data sets or combinations of data sets usedto estimate toxicity failure rates based upon measured oil content, thetoxicity failure rate for water-based drilling fluids which contain noadded oil (original formulation, no reported lubricity or spotting fluids)range from approximately 2% to 15%. That is, between 2% and 15% of thosewater-based drilling fluid systems that do not contain added oil may beexpected to fail the proposed toxicity limitation of 30,000 ppm SPP. Ifthe toxicity failure rate were closer to 15% than to 2%, the industry wouldincur considerably higher costs for compliance with the toxicity limitationthan the Agency had originally estimated. This factor, in conjunction withcertain other costing elements discussed below, can add significantly tothe aggregate industry compliance cost for the proposed effluent limitations.The majority of water-based drilling fluid systems used in the Gulf ofMexico do not contain added oil. Results of the API Drilling Fluid Surveyand the OOC Spotting Fluid Survey discussed previously support this conclusion.Reportedly, 88% of wells using water-based muds do not use oil for lubricity(API, 1983 data). Similarly, 78% of such wells do not use oil for spottingpurposes (API, 1983-86 data). Therefore, assuming that the number of newwells that will not use oil for lubricity or spotting purposes will beuniformly distributed, a minimum of 69% (88% andmultiply; 78%) of all water-baseddrilling fluid systems will contain no added oil. Assuming 978 new offshorewells are drilled each year (see ``Annual Rate of Development'', below),between 13 wells (2% andmultiply; 69% andmultiply; 978) and 101 wells (15%andmultiply; 69% andmultiply; 978) drilled each year using water-based mudswith no added oil may fail the proposed 30,000 ppm SPP toxicity limitation.Thus, as shown on Table 2 in Section IV of this part, the estimated annualindustry cost of complying with only the proposed toxicity limitation of30,000 ppm SPP varies from $22 million to $48 million (1986 dollars) dependingon the estimated toxicity failure rate of water-based muds to which nooil has been added.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Annual Rate of Development</ITAG>The costing and economic analyses for the proposed regulation were basedupon an annual average of 1166 offshore wells drilled per year throughthe year 2000. The revised costing and economics are based upon an annualaverage of 978 wells drilled per year through the year 2000. The revisedestimate is based upon updated projections of offshore oil and gas activitydeveloped by the Department of Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS).MMS has published 30-year forecasts of Outer Continental Shelf oil andgas production for major regions: the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Pacific,and Alaska. These projections improve upon the Department of Energy/EnergyAdministration forecasts used by EPA at proposal for reasons outlined inSection IV of this part of today's notice.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Model Well Characteristics</ITAG>Model well characteristics were established for the purpose of estimatingcompliance costs for the regulatory approaches under consideration. Theassumed characteristics of a model 10,000 foot well in the Gulf of Mexicoare discussed in Part 2 of this notice and are summarized below.Drilling a typical 10,000 foot well is assumed to take 35 calendar dayswith 20 days of actual drilling time. The volumes of drilling fluid anddrill cuttings discharges from a 10,000 foot model well are estimated tobe 6,749 and 1,430 barrels, respectively. Water-based drilling fluids withoil added for lubricity plus spotting purposes are assumed to contain 5%oil by volume. Untreated drill cuttings associated with oil-based drillingfluids are assumed to contain 20% oil by weight. Drill cuttings associatedwith water-based drilling fluids to which oil has been added are assumedto contain 1% oil by weight.There are two major refinements to the model well characteristics usedfor evaluating the proposed regulation and those used for the revised estimatespresented in today's notice. They are: (1) An additional bulk mud dischargeof 1,400 barrels to account for the active mud system at the end of a drillingcampaign; and (2) an assumption of 1% instead of 10% oil content (weightbasis) in cuttings associated with the use of water-based muds to whichoil has been added.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Transportation and Disposal</ITAG>For drilling wastes that do not comply with the proposed effluent limitations,the method of disposal at proposal and now is assumed to be transport ofthe wastes to shore by vessel for reconditioning and reuse (oil muds) orland disposal (cuttings and water-based muds). Model cost scenarios fortransport and disposal were based on information provided by industry sources,as presented in Part 2 of this notice. These costs include rental of supplyboats at $3,000 per day, and revised costs for material containers, laborfor loading, and unloading, transport, and landfill disposal at $6.50 perbarrel of mud and $6.00 per barrel of cuttings.The number or proportion of all water-based drilling fluid systems andassociated cuttings that would have to be disposed of in this manner wasreestimated. The estimate used for the proposed regulation was that 10%of all muds and cuttings would have to be transported to shore for disposaldue to failure of one or more of the proposed effluent limitations. Revisedestimates range up to 23% of all water-based muds and about 3% of all associatedcuttings being transported to shore for disposal. (For oil-based muds andassociated cuttings, there is no change from the 1985 proposed requirementthat all such wastes would have to be transported to shore for disposal.)<ITAG tagnum="81">E. Use of Oil-Based and Water-Based Drilling Fluids</ITAG>The original and revised costing approaches assume the use of a water-basedmud system in all wells down to the 10,000 foot model well depth. Oil-basedmuds may be used for the more difficult drilling situations (<T3>e.g., </T3>deviated holes at greater depths) to improve lubricity,thereby reducing torque and increasing the rate of penetration, to improvetemperature stability of the mud system, and to reduce the chances of stuckdrill pipe. Oil-based muds are also used in specific geologies like shaleto preclude distortion of the formation strata that could occur throughthe absorption of water from water-based muds. API data for 1984 indicatethat the average depth of all wells drilled deeper than the model wellwas 14,000 feet. It was assumed for recosting purposes that oil-based mudswould be used below 10,000 feet. Of all the wells accounted for in the1984 API data base, 30.8% were deeper than 10,000 feet and were assumedto have used oil-based muds at the depth interval 10,000 to 14,000 feet.<ITAG tagnum="81">F. Cost Differential Between Diesel and Mineral Oils</ITAG>The cost of substituting mineral oil for diesel oil was established atthe time of the proposed regulation at $2.10 per gallon. This differentialcost included the increase in delivered purchase price of the mineral oilover diesel oil and the costs to provide and maintain separate onsite storagefacilities for the mineral oil. Revised estimates presented in today'snotice include a differential cost of $2.00 per gallon for calculationsinvolving mineral oil substitution.<ITAG tagnum="81">G. Pollutant Reduction Estimates</ITAG>The issue of pollutant reduction does not directly affect the aggregatecosting of the amended regulatory approach. However, pollutant reductionestimates are used in determining benefits and are used in evaluating thecost-effectiveness of the various regulatory options. The revised analysispresented in this part incorporates estimates of the reductions of specificpollutants (identified below) that would be achieved for each of the candidateregulatory approaches presented in this part of today's notice.Determinations of the priority pollutant organics and nonconventional organicscontent of diesel oil and mineral oil mud additives were made in laboratoryresearch sponsored by the industry. These data were used by the Agencyto estimate potential reductions in the direct discharge of benzene, naphthalene,fluorene, phenanthrene, phenol and their alkylated homologues. Dischargereduction estimates were also made for mercury, cadmium, and several othermetallic priority pollutants found in drilling fluids and associated drillcuttings.<ITAG tagnum="81">H. Failure Rate for ``No Discharge of Free Oil'' Limitation (StaticSheen Test)</ITAG>The approach followed by the Agency to re-cost compliance with the proposedregulation included consideration of expected failure rates for the staticsheen test. As previously noted, the total population of wells employingwater-based mud systems were grouped into three classes: muds with no addedoil, muds with oil added for lubricity, and muds with oil added for spottingpurposes. The percentage of wells with discharges that would be likelyto comply with the ``no discharge of free oil'' limitation based on thestatic sheen test were estimated for each of the three classes considered.Compliance costs were then determined based on transporting the wastesto shore for land disposal.<ITAG tagnum="81">I. Monitoring Costs </ITAG>The cost of monitoring for compliance with effluent limitations is consideredto be an element of the total costs of compliance with the regulation.The preamble to the proposed regulations contained a ``suggested'' or ``typical''monitoring frequency and analytical cost for each pollutant and waste streamsubject to the regulation for a facility where both development and productionoperations are being performed. As such, the total monitoring costs presentedwere considered to be conservatively high.Changes were made to the monitoring frequencies and analytical costs presentedin the August 26, 1985 proposal for the muds and cuttings waste streams.These changes involved the monitoring frequency of the static sheen testand the addition of the diesel detection analysis.

Industry Profile </ITAG>Since the proposal of August 26, 1985 (50 FR 34592), the Agency has updatedthe forecast of offshore oil and gas activity. This updated forecast replacesthe projections developed for the proposal and presented in EPA's reporttitled ``Economic Impact Analysis of Proposed Effluent Limitations andStandards for the Offshore Oil and Gas Industry'', EPA 440/2-85-003, July1985. Those projections were based upon a 1984 Department of Energy/EnergyInformation Administration (DOE/EIA) production forecast. The Agency's revised projections are presented in the Economic Impact Analysisfor this notice which is available in the record for this rulemaking. Therevised projections are in response to recent changes in world oil pricesand to the comments on the proposed regulations made by the Offshore OperatorsCommittee (OOC) in February of 1986. The new Outer Continental Shelf (OCS)forecast has been developed using Department of Interior/Minerals ManagementService (DOI/MMS) sophisticated production projections. Three alternativeoil price scenarios have been analyzed: one at $32, one at $21, and oneat $15 per barrel of oil. EPA's updated projections of OCS offshore oil and gas activity rely onthe 30-year forecasts of oil and gas production developed by the MineralsManagement Service. MMS developed its forecast based upon the data usedin MMS' Environmental Impact Statement for the Proposed 5-year Outer ContinentalShelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program (1987-1992), MMS 86-0127. In that report,MMS estimated ``conditional resources'' for 21 OCS regions, assuming amarket value of $32 per barrel of oil (1986 dollars). These conditionalresources represent the mean amount of oil and gas reserves that are economicallyrecoverable from the leased areas, given that exploration confirms thepresence of hydrocarbon reserves. The probability of finding reserves variesfrom region to region. An estimate of the expected resources to be developedin each leased area can be obtained by multiplying the probability of findingreserves (estimated by MMS) by the conditional resource estimates. Usingthis resource estimate, and rules-of-thumb regarding the amount of timeit takes to develop the resources in each area, MMS has developed a scheduleof resource production for the 1987-1992 lease sales. To develop the full 30-year projections, MMS used its estimates of thepercentage of undeveloped resources to be leased during each of its subsequentleasing periods. For example, if 25 percent of Alaska's resources are expectedto be leased in 1987-1992, and 25 percent of Alaska's resources are expectedto be leased in 1992-1996, then the resource projections for the 1992-1996lease would replicate the resource projections for the 1987-1992 lease,with a 5-year lag. If 50 percent of Alaska's resources were to be leasedin 1992-1996, then the projections would be double those for the 1987-1992lease, with a 5-year lag. Based on this methodology, MMS has published 30-year projections of OCSoil and gas production for four major regions: the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico,Pacific, and Alaska. These projections improve upon the DOE/EIA forecastused by EPA at proposal for the following reasons. First, the MMS forecastis based on a disaggregated analysis of resource potential and lease activityin each of the four regions. Second, the DOE/EIA forecast did not extendbeyond 1995 while the MMS forecast extends to 2015; thus the MMS forecastincreases the accuracy of the Agency's projections to 2000. Finally, theMMS forecast is easily amenable to different price scenarios. In its ``SecretarialIssue Document'' (1987), MMS developed alternative leasable resource estimatesfor various prices. Based on these resource estimates, the ratio of resourcesat $21 per barrel to $32 per barrel, and $15 to $32 per barrel are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s25,10,7.3</C> <H1>Region</H1><H1>Ratio of $21/bbl to $32/bbl</H1><H1>Ratio of $15/bbl to $32/bbl</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Gulf <D>0.965 </D><D>0.858</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pacific <D>0.790</D><D>0.541</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Atlantic <D>0.514 </D><D>0.327</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Alaska <D>0.098 </D><D>0.0</D></ITAG></ITAG> These ratios mean, for example, that using the MMS resource estimates forthe Pacific OCS at $32 per barrel as the basis (<T3>i.e.,</T3> MMS projections at $32 per barrel equal 100 percent), theAgency estimates that 79 percent of these Pacific resources would be developedif the price of oil fell to $21 per barrel. Similarly, if the price fellfrom $32 to $15 per barrel, the Agency projects that it would make economicsense for the oil and gas industry to develop 54.1 percent of those Pacificresources. These ratios were used to develop the two alternative forecastsfrom the $32 per barrel forecast. The Agency has aslo developed new projections for the number of wells drilledin state offshore waters and the number and configuration of offshore platforms.The revised estimates reflect the declining role of state waters in oiland gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. (Between 1967 and 1985 the state-to-federalratio dropped about 30 percent every seven years.) Drilling in the statewaters of the Gulf of Mexico is projected to be 11 percent of federal productionfor the period 1986-1992 and 8 percent for the period 1993-2000. No statewater activity is projected in the Atlantic. Based upon drilling activityin state waters between 1980 and 1985, drilling in state waters is projectedto be 50 percent of the activity in federal waters in the Pacific and 300percent of federal activity in Alaska. In the following discussion of the economic impacts of the regulation,only the results of the Agency's analysis based on an average oil pricefor the years 1986-2000 of $21 per barrel are presented. At this price,an average of 978 wells are projected to be drilled each year. (If theaverage price of oil is $15 per barrel between now and the year 2000, 807wells are projected to be drilled each year; if the oil price is $32 perbarrel, 1,178 wells would be drilled.) <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Economic Impacts </ITAG>At proposal, the Agency estimated the total annual cost of the selecteddrilling fluids and cuttings option at $36.7 million (in 1986 dollars).Table 1 presents the Agency's revised estimate of the cost of the proposedregulations for drilling fluids and cuttings which now totals $76.6 millionannually. The annual estimated cost of controlling drilling fluids hasincreased from $27.7 million at proposal to $71.1 million. The annual costof controlling drill cuttings has decreased from $9.1 million to $5.5 million.The revised estimates for the proposed regulations have increased despitesome declines in components of the estimate (<T3>e.g.,</T3> the number of wells drilled per year and the monitoringcosts per well). The increase in the revised cost estimates for the proposedregulations is due primarily to increases in: (1) The percentage of thedrilling fluids that would have to be transported to shore for disposal(``barged'') and (2) the per-well cost of barging drilling fluids. Bargingcosts are incurred when these drilling fluids fail the limitation on toxicityor the prohibition on the discharge of free oil. As indicated in Table1, the estimated percentage of drilling fluids that would fail effluentlimitations and thus be barged has increased from 10 percent to 23 percentbased upon revised estimates of effluent limitation failure rates discussedearlier in today's notice. The per-well cost of barging drilling fluidshas increased primarily because the volume of the model well drilling fluidsystem was increased from about 5300 to about 6700 barrels as discussedearlier in Section III. The Agency has identified four alternative approaches for controlling offshoredrilling fluids and drill cuttings discharges. The term ``approach'' isused to refer to any one of four particular scenarios for costing purposeswhich are differentiated by: (1) The differing toxicity failure rates for water-based drilling fluidsto which no oil has been added, as presented in Section III.A. of thispart of today's notice, and (2) The differing sets of effluent limitations for mercury and cadmiumis drilling fluids as presented in Section II.D. of this part of today'snotice. The first approach, identified here as ``Approach A'' is the onethat is most similar to the regulatory option proposed in 1985, but asexplained above, that option has been recosted to incorporate commentsthe Agency has received and updated information the Agency has gatheredsince proposal in 1985. Approaches B, C, and D are variations on ApproachA, reflecting the differences as explained in Section III above. The four approaches are summarized below: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,8,8</C> <H1>Assumptions</H1><H1>Failure</H1><H2>Toxicity</H2><ITAG tagnum="1"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/>  <H1>Approach</H1><H1>Rate for water-based fluids (percent)</H1><H1>Limitations\2\ for Hg andamp; Cd</H1><H1>Total annual cost ($00, 1986 dollars)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">A.\1\ <D>15 </D><D>1, 1  </D><D>$76,617</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">B. <D>2 </D><D>1, 1  </D><D>50,662</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">C. <D>15 </D><D>1.5, 2.5 </D><D>66,113</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">D. <D>2 </D><D>1.5, 2.5 </D><D>40,158 </D><F>\1\ Of the four approaches, Approach A is most similar to the 1985 proposedregulatory option. </F><F>\2\ 1, 1 means 1 mg/kg each mercury and cadmium in discharged drillingfluids; 1.5, 2.5 means 1.5 mg/kg mercury and 2.5 mg/kg cadmium in dischargeddrilling fluids.</F></ITAG></ITAG> As shown in the last column of the above table, the total annual costsfor the four approaches range between $40.2 million and $76.6 million.Costs are given in 1986 dollars here and on Tables 1, 2, and 3 below because1986 is the most recent year for which a consistent and complete set ofdata is available for use in the economic impact analysis model. (For reference,these total costs are estimated to range between $42.0 million and $80.1million in 1988 dollars, if they are adjusted for inflation using the <T3>Engineering News Record's</T3> construction index for the first sixmonths of 1988.) The technology basis and the limitations of Approach A are similar to thoseof the proposed regulation. As shown on Table 2, the costs of controllingfluids are more for A than for B is based on the assumption that more drillingfluids pass the toxicity test, and thus, under Approach B, fewer wellsincur the cost of barging. Table 2 also shows that the costs of Approach C are less than the costsof Approach A (and the costs of D are less than the costs of B). ApproachesA and B cost more because they include limitations on the mercury and cadmiumcontent of discharged drilling fluids at a maximum (no single sample toexceed) concentration of 1 mg/kg each on a dry weight basis in whole drillingfluid. This limitation is estimated to increase the cost of barite by 15percent, due to increased costs for transporting and segregating ``clean''barite for use in offshore drilling. The annual cost of this barite limitationis $10.5 million (in 1986 dollars). Approaches C and D cost less becausethey contain less stringent limitations for mercury and cadmium. The 1.5mg/kg mercury and 2.5 mg/kg cadmium limitations are estimated to be achievableat no additional cost, because they are based on the use of barite containingno more than 3 mg/kg of mercury and 5 mg/kg of cadmium. Thus, current suppliesof barite for offshore drilling can meet these alternative limitations.The estimated costs for approaches A, B, C, and D are all higher than theestimated cost of the proposal option. However, all four approaches presentedin this notice are economically achievable. The Agency's economic impactnotice are economically achievable. The Agency's economic impact analysiscompares the cost of oil and gas drilling in the absence of any BAT/NSPSregulations (<T3>i.e.,</T3> the base case) to the cost of drilling with each of theregulatory approaches_A, B, C, and D. The results of this analysis aresummarized in Table 3 for a 12-well, oil-only model platform in the Gulfof Mexico. Comparing compliance costs to the base case, drilling costsfor a typical well would increase between 1.03 percent (for Approach D)to 1.95 percent (for Approach A). With the regulation, the net presentvalue of a typical drilling project in the Gulf of Mexico would declinebetween 1.5 and 3.0 percent, and the cost of producing a barrel of oilwould increase between four and eight cents. For a major oil company (whichis the typical participant in offshore oil drilling projects), the debtincurred due to any of the four regulatory approaches represents only 0.01percent of the company's net worth. As shown on Table 3, the cost of theregulation also has no appreciable impact on any of the financial ratiosexamined for these oil companies, including: the current ratio, the longterm debt-to-equity ratio and the debt-to-capital ratio. The Agency's analysisshows that the economic impacts of the regulation are not substantial,and thus any of the approaches presented in this notice are economicallyachievable. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Cost-Effectiveness </ITAG>In addition to the foregoing analyses, the Agency has performed a cost-effectivenessanalysis of the two levels of cadmium and mercury limitations presentedin today's notice. Table 4A presents the cost-effectiveness of these twolevels (Approaches A and C) based on the assumption of a toxicity failurerate of 15 percent for those water-based drilling fluids to which no oilhas been added. Table 4B presents the cost-effectiveness of the same levelsof limitations for cadmium and mercury but with a toxicity failure rateof 2 percent for those water-based drilling fluids to which no oil hasbeen added (Approaches B and D). According to the Agency's standard procedures for calculating cost-effectiveness,on each of the tables the approaches have been ranked in order of increasingpound-equivalents (PE) removed. The pound equivalents removed for eachapproach were calculated as the number of pounds of pollutants removedby implementing each approach weighted by the relative toxicity of thosepollutants. The results of these calculations are shown in the second columnsof Tables 4A and 4B. (The ``Cost-Effectiveness Report,'' which is availablein the record of this rulemaking, supports this presentation, describesthe cost-effectiveness procedures in detail, and presents the toxic weightsused for each approach.) Cost-effectiveness is calculated as the ratioof the incremental annual cost to the incremental pound equivalents removedby the levels of control shown in the tables. So that comparisons of thecost-effectiveness among industries may be made, the annual costs are convertedto 1981 dollars.The cost-effectiveness of the regulatory approaches is shown in the lastcolumn of Tables 4A and 4B below. All approaches are cost-effective:Assuming a failure rate of 15 percent as shown on Table 4A, Approach Cis $69 and Approach A is $19 per pound equivalent removed.Assuming a failure rate of 2 percent as shown on Table 4B, Approach D is$54 and Approach B is $16 per pound equivalent removed.These costs are well within the range of the cost-effectiveness of newsource performance standards for other industries.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Costs and Other Significant Parameters of Proposal Option and of ComparableApproach A, Drilling Fluids and Cuttings</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[1986 dollars]</ITAG><H1>Parameter</H1><H1>At proposal 1985 for selected option</H1><H1>Revised estimate for comparable approach A</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Number of wells drilled annually<D>1,166</D><D>978</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Average price of oil per barrel 1985/6 to 2000<D>$32</D><D>$21 </D></ITAG>Percent barged:<ITAG tagnum="3">Drilling fluids</ITAG><D>10%</D><D>23%</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Drilling cuttings</ITAG><D>10%</D><D>\1\ 7% </D>Average cost of barging per well where barging is required:<ITAG tagnum="3">Fluids</ITAG><D>$113,000</D><D>$251,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Cuttings</ITAG><D>$69,000</D><D>$73,000</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Total barite costs<D>$11,200,000</D><D>$10,504,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Monitoring costs per well<D>$3,734</D><D>$3,100 </D></ITAG>Total annual costs:<ITAG tagnum="3">Fluids</ITAG><D>$27,664,000</D><D>$71,140,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Cuttings</ITAG><D>$9,072,000</D><D>$5,477,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Total</ITAG><D>$36,736,000</D><D>$76,617,000</D><F>\1\ Includes both cuttings associated with water-based fluids (about3%) and cuttings associated with mineral-oil based fluids. </F></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>2._<T4>Regulatory Cost of Alternative Pollution Control Approaches </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[$000, 1986 dollars] </ITAG><H1>Parameter</H1><H1>Alternative pollution control approaches </H1><H2>Approach A </H2><H2>Approach B </H2><H2>Approach C </H2><H2>Approach D</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Drilling fluid costs<D>$71,140</D><D>$45,185</D><D>$60,636</D><D>$34,681</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Clean barite <D>10,504 </D><D>10,504 </D><D>0 </D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mineral oil substitution for diesel oil <D>1,706 </D><D>1,706 </D><D>1,706 </D><D>1,706</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Static sheen test failure <D>8,288 </D><D>8,288 </D><D>8,288 </D><D>8,288</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toxicity test failure <D>48,099 </D><D>22,144 </D><D>48,099 </D><D>22,144</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Monitoring costs <D>2,543 </D><D>2,543 </D><D>2,543 </D><D>2,543</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Drill cuttings costs <D>5,477 </D><D>5,477 </D><D>5,477 </D><D>5,477</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Static sheen test failure <D>1,735 </D><D>1,735 </D><D>1,735 </D><D>1,735</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">No discharge with use of oil-based muds <D>3,253 </D><D>3,253 </D><D>3,253 </D><D>3,253</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Monitoring costs <D>489 </D><D>489 </D><D>489 </D><D>489</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Total annual costs \1\ <D>76,617 </D><D>50,662 </D><D>66,113 </D><D>40,158</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Average costs per well drilled <D>78 </D><D>52 </D><D>68 </D><D>41</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent of drilling fluids barged <D>23.3% </D><D>12.5% </D><D>23.2% </D><D>12.5%</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent of drill cuttings barged \2\ <D>6.7% </D><D>6.7% </D><D>6.7% </D><D>6.7%</D><F>\1\ For 978 wells per year, based upon average oil price of $21/bbl.</F><F>\2\ Includes both cuttings associated with water-based fluids and cuttingsassociated with mineral oil-based fluids.</F><F/></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 3._<T4>Economic Impacts of the Offshore Oil and Gas Regulation on Muds andCuttings, </T4>1986-200 0a <ITAG tagnum="96">[Selected Paramenters]</ITAG><H1>Approach </H1>b<H1> Total annual cost of regulation </H1><H2>Dollar millions </H2><H1>Change in drilling costs per well</H1><H2>Dollar thousand </H2><H2>Percent</H2><H1>Project Impacts;

Mercury and Cadmium in Barite and Environmental Consequences onAquatic Life</ITAG>Mercury and cadmium are two potentially toxic constituents of barite-containingdrilling fluids. The potential environmental impacts of the dischargesof these metals in drilling fluids have been investigated by the Agency(1).Sediment mercury and cadmium concentrations resulting from barite-containingdrilling fluid discharges were estimated and evaluated to determine environmentallysignificant sediment alterations. Specifically, the Agency's study:andbullet; Assesses the degree to which sediment levels of mercury and cadmiummay be altered at the local level (<T3>e.g.,</T3> within a 500 m radius of the drilling facility);andbullet; Assesses the degree to which sediment levels of mercury and cadmiummay be altered at the regional level for three cumulative discharge scenarios;andbullet; Evaluates environmental consequences of sediment enrichment bymercury and cadmium with regard to what is known concerning the biologicalavailability of these metals.All modeled levels of mercury (1 and 3 ppm) and cadmium (1 and 5 ppm) inbarite showed some increase in sediments within 500 meters of the model58-well Gulf of Mexico platform (the model size facility selected for theenvironmental assessment). At low background sediment levels (0.01 ppmfor mercury and 0.04 ppm for cadmium) and higher assumed levels of 3 ppmfor mercury and 5 ppm for cadmium in barite, the average increase werein excess of 2000% (an increase of 20 times) for mercury over 800% (anincrease of 8 times for cadmium. The average increases at the lower assumedlevels of 1 ppm for mercury and cadmium in barite were over 600% and over160%, respectively at low background sediment levels. At high backgroundsediment levels (0.04 ppm for mercury and 0.2 ppm for cadmium), the averageincreases in sediment were approximately 500% for mercury and 160% forcadmium at higher specified levels, and approximately 160% for mercuryand 25% for cadmium at lower assumed levels (1 ppm each).Because a large fraction of the drilling muds is expected to be transferredbeyond the immediate vicinity of the platform, the cumulative impacts ofmultiple drilling were analyzed for three regional scenarios: the SantaBarbara Channel, a Louisiana continental shelf area, and the entire LouisianaGulf of Mexico lease area.The estimated increase in added barite concentrations at the sediment surfaceafter 24 years would be 1524 ppm for the Santa Barbara Channel, 933 ppmfor the Louisiana shelf area, and 272 ppm for the entire Louisiana leasearea. Ther analysis assumes typical sediment mixing conditions, and thatall solids stay within the regional areas modeled. At low background mercuryand cadmium sediment levels (0.01 ppm for mercury and 0.04 ppm for cadmium)and barite containing 3 ppm of mercury and 5 ppm of cadmium, the increasesof mercury and cadmium in the Santa Barbara Channel sediments were estimatedat 46% and 19% respectively. At high background sediment levels (0.04 ppmmercury and 0.2 ppm cadimum), the increases would be 11% and 4%, respectively.If barite controls 1 ppm of mercury and cadimum the projected regionalincreases are 15% and 4% respectively for low background sediment levels,and 3% for mercury and andless;1% for cadimum for high background sedimentlevels.For the Louisiana shelf and the entire Louisiana offshore lease area theresulting projected regional increases for the same mercury and cadimumbarite and background sediment levels were approximately \2/3\ and \1/5\of the levels estimated for the Santa Barbara Channel due to lower estimatedwell density.This analysis shows that barite could be a measurable source of mercuryand cadmium near drilling platforms in sediments if present at the dischargelevels used in this analysis, even if the sediment transport processeseventually remove some fraction of the barite from the shelf sedimentsand redeposit it in deeper offshore areas where the environmental impactsare expected to be less signifiant.The comments received from the industry on the proposed regulation statedthat the cadimum and mercury associated with drilling fluids are presentas insoluble sulfides in barite and have a very low bioavailability tomarine organisms.The Agency recognizes that an incremental increase in sediment metals doesnot necessarily translate into a comparable increase of impacts on marinelife. However, these data show that mercury and cadmium discharged withthe barite containing drilling fluids have a potential to cause environmentalproblems in the marine environment and a potential for transport to humansthrough consumption of contaminated seafood, especially shellfish.The environmental consequences of elevated local and regional concentrationsof mercury and cadmium due to barite-containing drilling fluids are difficultto judge, because many aspects related to the environmental fate of thesemetals in marine environment are not well understood. An extensive literaturereview was carried out as part of this study on fate and effects of thesemetals on marine environments, especially with respect to bioavailability,bioaccumulation, and biomagnification in the food chain.Based on the U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) Report(2), the ability of a metal to affect marine organisms depends primarilyon its form (e.g., dissolved or particulate, bound to other substancesor free), and this is greatly affected by site-specific conditions. Intheir particulate form, most metals tend to adsorb onto other particlesthat eventually settle from the water and are deposited as sediment. Oncedeposited in oxygen-poor sediments, the chemical form of these metals isgenerally stable. However, if the sediments are subsequently oxygenated,some metals, including cadmium, may dissolve and be slowly released intothe water column, and may be taken up by non-benthic organisms. Sedimentscan be oxygenated (and also resuspended) by bioturbation, storms, and otherdisturbances. Metals also can be released as a result of other changessuch as salinity fluctuation in estuaries. Microorganisms in sedimentscan modify the slightly toxic inorganic mercury and convert it to highlytoxic and volatile methyl mercury.OTA's report (2) identified a significant potential for transport of bothmercury and cadmium to humans through consumption of contaminated seafood.Marine organisms can ingest metals that are dissolved in the water or theycan ingest particulate matter onto which metals are adsorbed. Once ingested,some metals can pass through the gut and be excreted, while others crossthe gut membrane and accumulate in organismal tissue. Both cadmium andmercury tend to bioaccumulate in marine organisms. Mercury in its methylatedform is the only metal known to biomagnify in successive levels of theaquatic food chain. Even when bioaccumulation is not a factor, significantquantities of metals can concentrate in the gut and gills of marine organismswithout actual absorption into the tissues. This is especially true forshellfish that filter large quantities of seawater and ingest solid matterduring feeding (<T3>e.g., </T3>oysters, clams, mussels).Because people generally eat these organisms in their entirety, toxic substancescan be passed to humans even in the absence of bioaccumulation. This mechanismprobably accounts for most instances of shellfish contamination involvingmetals that do not bioaccumulate.Results of investigation of sources, fates, and effects of metals nearmunicipal wastewater outfalls in southern California coastal waters indicatethat: (1) The largest portion of metals entering the system is in particulateform, but a large portion may be released into the dissolved phase uponmixing with seawater and may be carried out of the region by prevailingcurrents; (2) despite these losses of the solubilized fraction, the particulateand sediment concentrations of metals in the vicinity of municipal wastewateroutfalls are highly elevated; (3) filter feeders (<T3>e.g., </T3>scallops, mussels) have exhibited higher metal levels nearsources of contamination as compared to ``control'' areas; (4) there isevidence of bioaccumulation of metals in filter-feeding bivalves in thevicinity of marine outfalls; (5) concentrations of cadmium in muscle tissueof dimersal fish tend to be less than in sediments, but the concentrationsin the liver or hepatopancreas of animals could exceed that of the sediments.Analysis conducted by Trefrey et al. (3), investigating trace metals inbarite indicates that mercury is tightly bound in barite and not easilyreleased. Cadmium, however, is more easily leached from the barite thanmany other metals.None of the above data, however, provide conclusive evidence relative tothe stability or bioavailability of mercury and cadmium in barite-containingdrilling fluids. Work is currently underway within EPA and NOAA to definethe equilibrium partitioning of metals in sediments, pore water, and organisms.Results of these efforts are expected to aid in the evaluation of potentialimpacts of mercury and cadmium and other metals in barite-containing drillingfluids on aquatic organisms. However, the partitioning of these metalsfrom barite may be quite different from the partitioning from other discharges(<T3>e.g., </T3>sewage particles) or from ambient sediments.As discussed in previous sections of this notice, the Agency has foundthat as the levels of mercury and cadmium in barite are decreased, theother toxic metals in barite are also found to generally decrease. Arsenic,lead, zinc and other toxic metals may also be released into the marineenvironment as a result of barite discharges. In addition, the levels ofcadmium and mercury that can be expected to occur in sediments as a resultof potential offshore drilling activities will be dependent on the levelof drilling activity that will occur, the energenics of the region, andthe background levels of these metals in the sediment. All of these factorswill vary from one region of the country to another.The Agency is continuing to evaluate the environmental fate of mercury,cadmium and other toxic metals associated with barite to determine theimpacts of these discharges in the marine environment. The Agency is, therefore,soliciting new information related to the occurrence, bioavailability,release, bioaccumulation, and other related data on mercury, cadmium andother toxic metals in barite and in drilling fluids.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Analysis of Shallow Water Dispersion Models</ITAG>As part of the ongoing evaluation of potential impacts from offshore oiland gas discharges, discharge dispersion models were being examined asa component in an assessment of the fate and transport of drilling mudsand produced water in the marine environment. For the most part, modelshave been applied to discharge situations in relatively deep waters (greaterthan 40 meters in depth); their appropriateness and reliability in moreshallow waters (40 meters to mean high tide) is much less well known.In addition to discharges occurring in the deeper waters of the Outer ContinentalShelf (OCS), produced waters, drilling fluids, and other oil and gas dischargesare released in a geographic zone that extends from the high tide lineout to the OCS. In the Gulf of Mexico, where over 90% of all offshore productiontakes place, this geographic zone includes the offshore area extending9 miles off the coast of Texas and 3 miles off the coast of Louisiana.Of all offshore wells drilled in State waters off the coasts of Texas andLouisiana, approximately 11% are in water depths of greater than 20 meters,some 43% are in water depths of 10 to 20 meters, and about 46% are in waterdepths of less than 10 meters.Appropriate dispersion models for discharges occurring in these shallowwaters need to be identified. In response to this need, the Agency hasanalyzed existing dispersion models to identify the limitations of theirshallow water utility (4). Several potentially relevant dispersion modelswere identified and reviewed by the Agency to determine their applicabilityto shallow water, offshore oil and gas discharges (Table A). Of the modelsreviewed, some were rejected as not being appropriate for the type and/ormethods of discharge or receiving waters. Although under other circumstancesthese models have utility, they were judged to have limited, general applicationwith regard to shallow water marine discharges, oil and gas discharges,or the type of data presently available either for these areas or typesof discharges.The remaining models were divided into three categories and analyzed inmore detail. The first category includes models concentrating primarilyon the fate of discharged solids. These models may also predict the fateof the liquid phase. However, in these models the liquid phase was consideredas a secondary objective. The second category includes models that dealprimarily with the liquid phase of discharges; often, these models addressthermal effects. The third category includes models designed primarilyto address discharges of toxics.<ITAG tagnum="85">Table A.

Recommended Modeling Approach</ITAG>The OOC model, which was developed principally for drilling muds, appearsto be potentially applicable for shallow water dispersion of drilling fluidsat depths greater than 5 meters, and possibly to 2 meters. At any depthbelow the fixed depth to which the OOC model is found to be inappropriate,the EPA Time-Dependent, Two-Dimensional Model for Predicting Distributionof Drilling Muds Discharged to Shallow Water (EPA2-D) should be used. Whilethis model is appropriate at a depth of 2 meters, it may require additionalfield verification for shallower water.The EPA liquid phase models, particularly UMERGE and UDKHDEN, are potentiallyapplicable for modeling nonsurface or vertically downward discharge ofproduced water. For surface discharge, the PDS model may be appropriate;it is the only model that considers surface plumes. When the plume reachesto within one-half to one plume width from the surface or bottom, (thepoint at which UMERGE and UDKHDEN are no longer appropriate), a two-dimensionalmodel such as the Motts-Benedict (MOBEN) model or the EPA2-D model shouldbe used.As a part of this notice, the Agency is requesting comments on the listof models reviewed, the models selected as being appropriate for shallowwater discharges of drilling fluids and produced water, and the model scenariosused to assess both models behavior and effluent behavior. The discharge,operational, and ambient conditions that were used as input to the selectedmodels and the results of model runs are presented in the draft reporttitled ``Analysis of Effluent Dispersion Models Potentially Applicableto Shallow Water Discharges from Oil and Gas Activities'' (4), which isavailable in the record of this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="74">References for Section V</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) U.S. EPA, 1987, Estimates of Degree of Sediment Alteration Associatedwith Various Levels of Mercury and Cadmium in Barite.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, Wastes in MarineEnvironments, OTA-0-334 (Washington, DC.: U.S. Government Printing Office,April 1987).</ITAG>(3) Trefrey, J.H., et al., 1986, ``Draft and Final Report to the OffshoreOperators Committee: Forms, Reactivity, and Availability of Trace Metalsin Barite.''<ITAG tagnum="21">(4) U.S. EPA, 1988, ``Analysis of Effluent Dispersion Models PotentiallyApplicable to Shallow Water Discharges from Oil and Gas Activities.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Part 2</ITAG>I. SummaryEPA is currently reconsidering the prohibition on the discharge of drillcuttings that contain oil-based drilling fluid, as proposed in the August26, 1985 proposal and is considering as an alternative the developmentof an oil content limitation for drilling waste streams. ``Oil content''would be used as a non-conventional indicator pollutant for the BAT andNSPS levels to control the discharge of priority and non-conventional organicpollutants present in the hydrocarbons that are added to drilling fluids,both as a lubricity agent and for spotting purposes, and in the hydrocarbonsfrom formation fluids that are entrained in the drilling fluid. These samepriority and non-conventional pollutants are present in the associateddrill cuttings waste stream and may be similarly controlled by an oil contentlimitation. An oil content limitation would apply to the discharged drillingwaste and would not differentiate between diesel oil or mineral oil. Theoil content measurement would be performed according to the ``retort-gravimetric''procedure discussed in section IX of this part and is presented in AppendixA of this notice.Specifically, the Agency is now considering the establishment of an oilcontent limitation of up to 1.0% by weight (whole sample basis) for drillcuttings based upon application of thermal distillation, thermal oxidation,or solvent extraction technologies. An oil content limitation would applyto drill cuttings associated with both water-based and oil-based drillingfluids and would apply as a maximum value (no single sample to exceed).The Agency believes that the technologies discussed below are technologicallyfeasible to implement for the treatment of drill cuttings to reduce oilcontent.The Agency also has considered the establishment of an oil content limitationfor oil-based drilling fluids. The Agency has tentatively rejected thisapproach because existing regulations (BPT) effectively prohibit the dischargeof oil-based drilling fluids.Finally, the Agency has considered the establishment of an oil contentlimitation for waste-based drilling fluids that contain added or entrainedoil. The Agency believes that processing rate and storage limitations maymake it impracticable to implement an oil content limitation for water-baseddrilling fluids based on using any of these technologies to treat water-baseddrilling fluids at offshore drilling sites. These factors are discussedin Section V of this part of today's notice.The technologies discussed in this part of the notice would achieve a residualoil content in the processed cuttings which would be lower than those achievedusing cutting washer (<T3>i.e., </T3>BPT) technology. The current regulation prohibits the dischargeof ``free oil'' as evidenced by the presence of a visible sheen upon thereceiving water after discharge of the drilling waste.The BAT and NSPS regulations for drill cuttings proposed on August 26,1985 would prohibit the discharge of drill cuttings associated with theuse of an oil-based drilling fluid. Several commenters on the proposedregulations argued that the discharge of cuttings associated with oil-basedfluids should be allowed if the oil content were controlled to acceptablelevels, <T3>i.e.,</T3> the discharged cutting did not violate the sheen test usedto detect free oil. The Agency proposed to prohibit unconditionally thedischarge of such cuttings because of substantial historical experiencewith the seepage of oil from such cuttings after they were discharged.Though such cuttings may comply with the BPT ``free oil'' limitation upondischarge, they could release substantial amounts of oil from their locationon the ocean floor long after the original discharge occurred.Allowing the discharge of treated drill cuttings associated with oil-baseddrilling fluids, as opposed to a prohibition on their discharge, couldlead to the continued development of control/treatment technologies, reducedregulatory compliance costs for the offshore segment of the industry, andalleviation of potential problems with land disposal of drilling wastesin coastal areas.The remainder of this part of today's notice presents more detailed informationand discussion on oil content limitations for drilling wastes. After considerationof the comments and any additional data received during the comment periodon this notice in addition to information in the existing rulemaking record,the Agency may decide to propose effluent limitations guidelines and standardsfor the control of oil content in drilling wastes.II. BackgroundAs stated elsewhere in this notice, on July 2, 1986 EPA Regions IV andVI issued a general National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit(the General Permit) regulating oil and gas exploration, development, andproduction activities in federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico. One of therequirements of the general permit is a prohibition on the discharge ofdrill cuttings associated with the use of oil-based or inverse emulsionfluids.During the comment period on the draft general permit, SEDSCO, Inc. (nowThermal Dynamics, Inc.) commented that it had developed a treatment technologywhich would be more effective in removing residual oil from drill cuttingsthan the previously available treatment methods. However, at that time,EPA decided that sufficient data were not available on the new technologyto justify an alternative effluent limitation. The general permit implementedthe ``no discharge of free oil'' requirement by prohibiting the dischargeof any drill cuttings associated with oil-based muds. The final generalpermit for the federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico was issued on July9, 1986.On August 15, 1986, Thermal Dynamics, Inc. (TDI) sought to stay the generalpermit limitation for the drill cuttings waste stream. TDI argued that,in view of its newly developed technology, prohibiting the discharge ofdrill cuttings associated with an oil-based drilling fluid was unnecessarilystringent as an implementation of the ``no discharge of free oil'' limitation.TDI stated that sufficient data were available to EPA to demonstrate thatsubstantial reductions in the oil content of cuttings could be achievedby termal distillation. TDI stated that this new technology could reducethe oil content of drill cuttings to a level equivalent to the ``no dischargeof free oil'' limitation.At the time Thermal Dynamics sought to stay the general permit limitation,only limited information was available on the efficiency of those technologiesin actual use. EPA Region VI issued a ``demonstration'' permit to an oilcompany to allow for field data to be generated on the operation of a thermaldistillation treatment system. A vendor-supplied thermal distillation unitwas used to treat drill cuttings produced during actual drilling operationswith oil-based drilling fluid. The cutting waste stream, processed cuttings,and associated by-product waste streams were characterized for oil content,solids content, priority pollutant organics and metals, RCRA (ResourceConseration and Recovery Act) ICR characteristics (ingnitability, corrosivity,reactivity) and acute toxicity (LC50).In view of the additional information obtained on this and other technologiesfor treating drilling wastes, EPA is reconsidering the proposed prohibitionon the discharge of drill cuttings that contain oil-based drilling fluid.EPA is now considering alternatives to the proposed discharge prohibition.One alternative being considered would allow the discharge of treated drillcuttings that meet a specified oil content limitation. Drill cuttings dischargeswould still have to achieve the BPT limitation of `no discharge of freeoil'. III. Description of Technologies for Controlling Oil Content of DrillingWastes The preamble to the 1985 proposed regulations include a discussion of cuttingswasher technology and its effectiveness for reducing the oil centent ofdrill cuttings. The Agency found that cuttings washer systems that werestudied were reported to reduce the oil content of drill cuttings to approximately10% by weight. However, the Agency rejected the use of cuttings washertechnology as a basis for an oil content limitation because it believedthat the cuttings washer technology did not achieve a reduction in oilcontent of the drill cuttings sufficient to meet the BPT requirement of`no discharge of oil'. Since 1985 the development and use of cuttings washertechnology appears to have diminished, possibly due to the relatively highresidual oil content of the processed cuttings and problems with properdisposal of by-product water/oil/detergent wastes. After the proposed regulations were published, the Agency investigatedother technologies for reducing the oil content of drilling wastes. Thesetechnologies fall into two general classes. In one class are thermal processes(thermal distillation or thermal oxidation). In the other class are solventextration processes. All of the technical and cost information providedby the vendors of these technologies and additional information collectedby the Agency is available in the public record for this rulemaking. The Agency has evaluated vendor technical information and collected performancedata on the treatment of drilling wastes, specifically drill cuttings associatedwith the use of oil-based drilling fluids, by thermal distillation. Thistechnology appears to be technologically feasible to implement for thereduction of oil contained in drilling wastes. Based on data obtained onthese technologies, the costs on a per well basis of onsite treatment usingthermal distillation or solvent extration appear to be in line with thecost estimates for transport to shore and land disposal of drilling wastes.The basic thermal distillation process has been adapted in variations byseveral vendors. The process removes hydrocarbons and water from drillingfluids and drill cuttings. There are three types of thermal systems knownto the Agency that are available for the treatment of drill cuttings. <ITAG tagnum="81">T-1 Process </ITAG>One type of system to treat drilling wastes consists of electrically heatedchambers in which the drilling wastes are exposed to controlled heat sufficientto volatilize the residual oil and water in the wastes. (This will be referredto as the ``T-1'' process). The electrical energy required by the processis provided by generators at the treatment site. The processed wastes in the form of a granular material are cooled andslurried by mixing with seawater and are then discharged to the ocean.The water and hydrocarbon vapors of driven from the wastes are condensedand then separated in an oil/water separator. The hydrocarbons recoveredcan potentially be recycled and reused in active mud system, subject tomeeting the specifications for oil additives to the mud. Alternatives torecycling the recovered hydrocarbons would be to dispose of them separatelyor to market them for other purposes (<T3>e.g.</T3>, heating fuel). If the revovered water meets effluent limitationsfor produced water, if could be suitable for discharge. It the recoveredwater does not meet these effluent limitations if may be appropriate tointroduce it to the produced water treatment system. If there are no productionfacilities at the site the recovered water may need to be transported toanother facility for adequate treatment or handling. Exhaust gases fromthe heating chambers in the thermal distillation unit and from the condenserwould be treated to achieve appropriate air emissions standards. These units are mobile and can be installed and operated on a rig to processwastes onsite. Full-size units have been field tested to treat drill cuttings.The T-1 process has been used to treat drill cuttings at an offshore facilityin the Gulf of Mexco, in the North Sea, onshore in Alaska, and at onshoredrilling sites in the Netherlands. At these locations, full-size unitswere used to treat drill cuttings for oil content reduction. The resultsof sampling performed by the vendor and by EPA indicate that the processcan achieve significant reduction in the oil content of drill cuttings.Observations to date indicate that this technology is capable of reducingoil content levels to 1% or less by weight in processed cuttings (associatedwith oil-based muds) and that geographic location is not a factor or restrictionin locating and operating this technology. (Source: Vendor and EPA samplingdata). A thermal distillation unit of this type was tested under the demonstrationpermit issued by EPA. Performance data on this unit is presented and discussedin Section VII of this part of the notice. <ITAG tagnum="81">T-2 Process </ITAG>Another variation of the thermal distillation process has been developedfor the reduction of hydrocarbons in drilling fluids and drill cuttings.(This will be referred to as the ``T-2'' process). The drilling wastesare routed to the drying section of the process where hydrocarbons andwater are driven from the wastes. The water and hydrocarbons driven offthe cuttings are passed through condensers and the resultant liquid isprocessed to separate the oil from the water. The oil is placed in storagefor further purification and the water is processed to effect additionalseparation of oil from the water. If the recovered water meets effluentlimitations for produced water, it could be suitable for discharge. Theunit has been used for offshore operations on mobile drill units, platformsor barges. A prototype ``demonstrator'' unit has been used to process drill cuttings.An oil content of less than 0.5% by weight was reportedly achieved in testwith this unit. (Source: Vendor-supplied information). A full-scale unithas not yet been tested under actual filed conditions. <ITAG tagnum="81">T-3 Process </ITAG>A third variation on the thermal distillation technology has been developed.This process uses indirect heating to vaporize water and hydrocarbons adheringto drilling wastes. (This will be referred to as the ``T-3'' process).In this process, drilling wates are fed to a blender which maintains ahomogeneous slurry feed to the process unit. A closed heat transfer systemaround the processing unit provides the heat required to vaporize the waterand hydrocarbons from the drilling waste. The proposed source of heat isexhaust gases from the rig electricity generator. The processed wastesare dry and granular in nature. The vaporized water and hydrocarbons arecondensed for their recovery. The condensed hydrocarbons and water canbe separated with potential for the hydrocarbons to be reused in the activemud system subject to meeting the specifications for oil additives to themud. If the recovered water from the separator meets effluent limitationsfor produced water, if could be suitable for discharge. The process is implemented using a skid-mounted mobile unit which is reportedlysuitable for use either offshore or onshore. This version of distillationtechnology has been tested on a pilot scale basis but not on a full-scalebasis. Pilot-scale tests on drilling wastes are reported to have producedcuttings consistently with an oil content of 6% or less by weight. (Source:Vendor-supplied information). <ITAG tagnum="81">T-4 Process </ITAG>A thermal oxidation process has also been developed which can be used totreat drilling wastes. (This will be referred to as the ``T-4'' process).The process consists of a direct fired, countercurrent rotary kiln wherethe wastes are thermally oxidized at temperatures typically in the rangeof 1600 F to 2500 F. The kilns can be over 200 feet in length. The driedsolids produced in this process are reportedly suitable for use as aggregatesor fill materials. The hydrocarbons driven from the wastes are partiallyoxidized in the kiln, while virtually complete combustion is achieved inan oxidation chamber and afterburner. At least two of these facilitiesare known to be currently operating on the Gulf of Mexico coast. However,due to the scale of the equipment as currently demonstrated, this processcan not be implemented offshore or moved from site-to-site. However, drillingwastes could be transported to such land-based facilities for processing.<ITAG tagnum="81">SE Process </ITAG>In addition to the thermal technologies described above, a process basedon solvent extraction technology has been developed to treat drilling wastesfor the reduction of oil content. (This will be referred to as the ``SE''process). In this process, the drilling wastes are directed to an extractioncolumn and contacted with solvent to extract the oil. The oil-laden solventflows from the extractor column to an evaporator, a separation column anda separator where the oil and solvent are separated. The oil phase flowsto the fluidizing oil holding tank and the solvent is recycled to the process.Oil levels as low as 0.3% by weight in the processed wastes are reportedlyachieved using this process. (Source: vendor-supplied information). Whenused to process used drilling fluids, one vendor reports that the resultantmud solids can be recovered for reuse. The types of solvents have been used in the solvent extraction processesinvestigated by the Agency_chlorofluorocarbons and carbon dioxide. Eithertype of solvent reportedly will serve the operational needs of the process.Although the solvents are used and recovered in a closed-type system, thereis potential for some solvent loss to the atmosphere. The Agency does nothave quantitative information on the amount of such solvent losses fromthese processes. The Agency is particularly concerned about the potentialfor losses of chlorofluorocarbon-type solvents from these processes tothe atmosphere because they contribute to depletion of the stratosphericozone layer, and the Agency has recently limited their production. (53FR 30566) The Agency is therefore soliciting comment and additional informationto assess this potential, to quantify the rate and amounts of such losses,and to determine whether there are acceptable alternatives to use of chlorofluorocarbon-typesolvents in these processes. IV. Applicability of Thermal and Solvent Extraction Technologies for TreatingDrilling Wastes <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Drill Cutting </ITAG>Hydrocarbons can be present in the drill cuttings as a result of the introductionof oil additives to the drilling fluid system for lubricity and spottingpurposes and the entrainment of formation hydrocarbons in the drillingfluid system. When the drill cuttings are separated from the drilling fluidsystem, they contain some of the drilling fluids and drilling fluid systemadditives (<T3>e.g., </T3>oil). The drilling fluids and oil additives that are carriedinto the drill cuttings wastes after their removal from the bulk mud systemby rig shale shakers and other separation equipment are considered to bepart of the drill cuttings waste stream. Based upon performance and cost information provided by several vendorsof thermal and solvent extraction technologies, it appears to be technologicallyfeasible to implement one or more of these technologies at offshore drillingsites for the reduction of oil content in drill cuttings. The costs (ona per well basis) of onsite treatment using thermal distillation or solventextraction appear to be in line with the cost estimates for transport toshore and land disposal of the same wastes. This applies to drill cuttingsassociated with the use of either water- or oil-based drilling fluids.These technologies appear to be well-suited and efficient for the reductionof oil content of such wastes over a broad range of hydrocarbon content.There appear to be no insurmountable technical difficulties associatedwith the placement of such equipment at offshore drilling sites, operationof the equipment, intermediate handling of raw cuttings wastes to be processed,and handling of processed cuttings wastes and by-product streams. Thesetechnologies are effective in achieving substantial reduction in the amountof hydrocarbons adhering to the drill cuttings. Specific levels of oilcontent in drill cuttings wastes processed by these technologies are presentedin later sections of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Drilling Fluids </ITAG><T3>Oil-Based Drilling Fluids. </T3>Thermal distillation/oxidation andsolvent extraction technologies appear to be suitable for processing materialswith variable hydrocarbon content. Oil-based drilling fluids (<T3>i.e., </T3>invert emulsion) can typically contain 30% or more oil byvolume (approx. 15% oil by weight). The high oil content (and low watercontent) of oil-based fluids should result in highly efficient removaland recovery of the oil by these technologies. However, the existing BPT requirement of ``no discharge of free oil'' effectivelyprohibits the discharge of oil-based drilling fluids to surface watersof the U.S. An oil content limitation for oil-based drilling fluids thatis based upon these technologies would be less stringent than the effectiveprohibition on the discharge of any of these wastes based upon the BPTrequirement of no discharge of free oil. Because the Agency's interpretationof the Clean Water Act precludes the establishment of BAT, BCT, or NSPSlimitations that are less stringent than BPT, it is not appropriate toconsider such a limitation or standard that would allow a discharge ofoil-based drilling fluids to surface waters. <T3>Water-Based Drilling Fluids. </T3>Water-based drilling fluids to whichoil has been added for lubricity or spotting purposes or such drillingfluids that contain entrained formation hydrocarbons are subject to theexisting BPT requirement of ``no discharge of free oil''. However, theamount or concentration of oil contained in water-based drilling fluidsfor any of these reasons is at considerably lower levels that that in oil-baseddrilling fluids. Oil levels in such water-based drilling fluids typicallyrange from nil to about 5% by volume (2.5% by weight). In many cases, water-baseddrilling fluids containing oil at levels in this range would not exhibita visible sheen (BPT ``no discharge of free oil'') upon their discharge.This following discussion applies to the use of thermal and solvent extractiontechnologies for treating such drilling fluids for the reduction of oilcontent. Three major factors make the use of the technologies under considerationless practicable for treating water-based drilling fluids at an offshoredrilling facility than for treating drill cuttings. First, for a given well, the volume of drilling fluids to be handled ismuch greater than the volume of drill cuttings. Depending upon the capacityand processing rate capability of the treatment unit, the time to processwaste drilling fluid generated during the drilling of a well could makeit impractical to conduct the treatment operation at the offshore facilitydue to space restrictions for storing the material and extended time requirementsfor treatment if temporary storage of the raw wastes was available.Second, even assuming that the waste drilling fluid generated during thedrilling of the well can be processed effectively, there remains a substanialvolume of drilling fluid to be disposed at the end of drilling. At theend of the drilling period, when the bulk drilling fluid system is readyto be disposed of, there is suddenly a large volume of drilling fluid thatneeds to be temporarily stored for subsequent processing (1400 bbl in themodel case). Space for storing drilling fluids on an offshore oil facilityis limited. Again, the length of time required to process the large volumeof drilling fluids at the end of drilling may make it infeasible to storethe drilling fluids on an offshore drilling facility prior to processing.Third, in the case of the thermal technologies, the much higher relativewater content of water-based drilling fluids requires a considerably higherinput of thermal energy to the process in order to vaporize the water present.(The water must be vaporized in order to remove the oil). This directlyincreases the costs for treating the drilling fluid. In cases where thethermal process is operating at or near its maximum capacity, the highenergy requirement (per unit of waste treated) may mean that the rate atwhich the drilling fluids can be processed will be substantially reduced.This in turn would require increased storage capacity for temporary onsitestorage of the raw waste prior to treatment. (This factor would be of negligibleconsideration for the land-based thermal oxidation technology.) One alternative might be to transport the bulk drilling fluid system toshore for subsequent treatment by one of the technologies under discussion.However, the cost for transportation to shore for processing would addconsiderably to the total cost of treatment. It may also require eitherthe expense of duplicate equipment on shore to process the bulk mud systemor else the cost and disruption associated with relocation of the processingequipment from the offshore facility to shore. This additional expensecould make the use of these technologies for treating the drilling fluidless attractive to industry than, for example, land disposal. V. Pollutant Reduction and Cost Estimates The Agency has evaluated the technological feasibility and costs of applyingthermal technologies and solvent extraction technologies to: (1) Drillcuttings associated with oil-based drilling fluids; (2) drill cuttingsassociated with water-based drilling fluids which contain oil that hasbeen added for lubricity purposes, spotting purposes, or which containentrained formation hydrocarbons; and (3) water-based drilling fluids towhich oil has been added for lubricity purposes, spotting purposes, orwhich contain formation hydrocarbons. This third scenario was evaluted to obtain estimates of increased energyrequirements and processing time for treating water-based drilling fluidswith a high water content. As discussed earlier, the Agency concluded fromthis analysis that the thermal distillation and solvent extraction technologiesunder consideration may not be appropriate as a basis for an oil contentlimitation for water-based drilling fluids at an offshore drilling site.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Pollutant Reduction Estimates </ITAG>This subsection presents a summary of the model drilling scenario whichis then used to establish estimates of oil content reduction in drill cuttingsand water-based drilling fluids wastes by the technologies described earlierin this part of today's notice. Then the resultant oil content reductionestimates are presented for drill cuttings and water based-drilling fluids.Although the Agency has tentatively concluded that the reduction of oilcontent in water-based drilling fluids may be impractical to implementat offshore drilling sites by these technologies, oil content reductionestimates are presented below to provide the reader with an indicationof the potential of the technologies for treating such wastes. The Agency's analyses of applying thermal processes and solvent extractionprocesses are based on a model 10,000 foot well in the Gulf of Mexico,as presented in Section II of Part 1 of today's notice. Drilling a ``typical'' 10,000 foot well is estimated to take 35 calendardays with 20 days of actual drilling time. The volume of drilling fluidto be handled from a 10,000 foot model well is 5349 barrels plus an additional1400 barrel active mud system. The volume of drill cuttings to be handledfrom the 10,000 foot model well is 1430 barrels. These model well characteristicsused in these analyses are based on the Agency's evaluation of recent industrysurveys. (Sources: 10,000 ft. model well_``1984 Joint Association Surveyon Drilling Costs'', Dec 1985, API; Drilling waste volumes and drillingtimes_``Alternate Disposal Methods for Mud and Cuttings, Gulf of Mexicoand Georges Bank:, Dec. 1981, Offshore Operators Committee). The untreated drill cuttings associated with oil-based drilling fluidsare estimated to contain 20% oil by weight (approx. 55% oil by volume).Untreated drill cuttings associated with water-based drilling fluid towhich oil has been added, as a spot, as a lubricity agent or from entrainedformation hydrocarbon, are estimated to contain 1% oil by weight (approx.2.8% oil by volume). Water-based drilling fluids with oil added for lubricityand spotting purposes are estimated to typically contain 5% oil by volume(approx. 2.5% oil by weight) and 58% water by volume (approx. 30% waterby weight). This 5% oil content by volume (approx. 2.5% oil by weight)is for a model situation where oil is added to the mud system for lubricityand spotting purposes, or is present due to entrained formation hydrocarbons.(Sources: EPA estimates; industry estimates) After treatment, the oil content of the drill cuttings from oil-based mudswas estimated to be reduced to 1% by weight (approx. 2.8% by volume) whenusing thermal distillation and to 0.3% by weight (approx. 0.8% by volume)when using solvent extraction. (Sources: EPA and T-1, T-2 and SE vendorsampling data.) Since the oil content of untreated drill cuttings from water-based mudsin the model case is 1% (weight), there would be little or no expectedreduction of oil content in such wastes when subject to thermal distillation.The oil content of drill cuttings from water-based muds is estimated tobe reduced to 0.3% by weight (approx. 0.8% by volume) when using solventextraction technology. (Sources: EPA and T-1, T-2, and SE vendor samplingdata). After treatment, the oil content of the water-based drilling fluids wasestimated to be reduced to 1% by weight (approx. 2% by volume) when usingthermal distillation and to 0.3% by weight (approx. 0.5% by volume) whenusing solvent extraction (Sources: EPA estimates). The volumes and weights of oil present in the drilling wastes before andafter treatment are shown on Table 5.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table 5._Oil Content Reduction of Drilling Wastes by Various TreatmentProcesses</T4><H1>Waste type</H1><H1>Total quantity of drilling waste \1\</H1><H2>bbls.</H2><H2>lbs.</H2><H1>Oil present before treatment \2\</H1><H2>bbls.</H2><H2>lbs.</H2><H1>Oil removed</H1><H2>bbls.</H2><H2>lbs.</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">OIL-BASED Drill Cuttings (20% oil by weight) TD-1 andamp; 2 Process Removalto 1% by wgt<D>1,430</D><D>1,330,000</D><D>792</D><D>266,000</D><D>752</D><D>252,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">OIL-BASED Drill Cuttings (20% oil by weight) SE Process Removal to.3% by wgt<D>1,430</D><D>1,330,000</D><D>792</D><D>266,00</D><D>780</D><D>261,500</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">WATER-BASED Drill Cuttings (1% oil by weight) TD-1 andamp; 2 ProcessRemoval to 1% by wgt<D>1,430</D><D>1,330,000</D><D>40</D><D>13,300</D><D>0</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">WATER-BASED Drill Cuttings (1% oil by weight) SE Process Removal to.3% by wgt<D>1,430</D><D>1,330,000</D><D>40</D><D>13,300</D><D>28</D><D>700</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">WATER-BASED Drilling Fluid (5% oil by volume) TD-1 andamp; 2 ProcessRemoval to 1% wgt<D>5,349</D><D>3,584,000</D><D>267</D><D>113,400</D><D>161</D><D>54,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">WATER-BASED Drilling Fluid (5% oil by volume) SE Process Removal to.3% wgt<D>5,349</D><D>3,584,000</D><D>276</D><D>113,400</D><D>235</D><D>79,100</D><F>Sources:</F><F>\1\ ``Alternate Disposal Methods for Mud and Cuttings Gulf of Mexicoand Georges Bank'', Dec. 1981, Offshore Operators Committee.</F><F>\2\ EPA Estimates.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">b. Operating Costs</ITAG>The Agency prepared treatment cost estimates based of information providedby vendors and by using standing engineering estimating procedures. Theseestimates have been prepared for two types of distillation processes (T-1Process and T-2 Process) and for one solvent extraction (SE-Process) processapplied to drill cuttings and water-based drilling fluids.The costs for leasing and operating these treatment processes differ fromvendor to vendor. Two vendors had one lease rate for actual drilling daysand a lower rate for standby days. The other vendor had a fixed lease ratefor both drilling and standby days.A monetary value was assigned to the oil recovered by the treatment process.The model scenario assumes that all of the oil removed from the drillingwastes by a given treatment process will be recovered. However, in practicethe amount of recovered oil will be less than 100% of that removed fromthe wastes, due to losses by fugitive emissions, vapor condensation lossesand oil/water separation efficiency for distillation processes and dueto solvent recovery efficiencies for the extraction process. This lossis assumed to be small and not to significantly affect the cost of usinga particular technology. The value of the recovered hydrocarbon is estimatedto be $26.50 per barrel (source: vendor-supplied information). This fullvalue of the recovered oil would be realized only if the oil is suitablefor reuse in drilling fluid. While it is reported that the recovered oilcan be reused in mud systems, the Agency is not aware that this practicehas been tested yet on a full-scale basis.The cost estimates include equipment rental costs, personnel costs, energycosts, and transportation costs. The equipment rental and energy costsare based upon whether the unit is in operating mode or standby mode. Asan example, a breakdown of the cost estimate for treatment of drill cuttingsby one of the thermal distillation processes (T-1) operating for 20 daysand on standby for 15 days is shown in Table 6. In this example, the estimatedenergy cost is the cost of fuel for the generator used to provide electricalenergy to operate the treatment equipment and to provide thermal energyfor processing the waste. (source: cost information from vendors, EPA estimates).The cost presented in Table 6 were developed with the conservative assumptionthat four wells are drilled consecutively. Mobilization and demobilizationcosts for drilling multiple wells at a given site are allocated among thenumber of wells (in this case four) assumed to be drilled during a givencampaign. Thus, each well is allocated only a part of the total mobilizationand demobilization costs for the treatment unit.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>6._<T4>Component Treatment Unit Lease and Operating Costs, Thermal Distillation</T4>(T-1 <T4>Process</T4>)<ITAG tagnum="96">[Drill cuttings from oil-based or water-based drilling fluids]</ITAG><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Rental for 20 day actual operating period ($4,000 per day)<D>=$80,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Rental for 15 day standby period ($1,500 per day)<D>=22,500</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Energy costs for unit during operation ($180 per day, 20 days)<D>=3,600</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Personnel living on rig (2 menandmultiply;35 daysandmultiply; $35 per day)<D>=2,450</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Transportation to rig (one boat for one day)*<D>=750</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Set-up on rig (including use of crane)*<D>=2,500</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tear down (including crane use)*<D>=1,250</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Transportation to shore (one boat for one day)*<D>=750</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Shore support<D>=3,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Transporting personnel to and from rig weekly (5andmultiply;$600)<D>=3,000</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total<D>=119,800</D><F/><T2>Note._</T2>(1) Costs treating for drill cuttings assume the unit willbe operating for 20 days and on standby for 15 days.<F>(2) Costs marked * are based on mobilization and demobilization costsbeing apportioned between 4 wells drilled consecutively at the same facility.</F><F>(3) Cost of deck space usage is not included.</F><F/></ITAG></ITAG>The operating costs in Table 7 were estimated in a similar manner for theother two processes being considered.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Drill Cuttings from Oil- and Water-Based Drilling Fluids</ITAG>Cost estimates were developed for the treatment of drill cuttings. Thecosts for leasing and operating two types of thermal distillation units(T-1 and T-2) and the solvent extraction unit (SE) over a 35 day drillingperiod, including auxiliary costs, were estimated. In this scenario wherethe systems are used to treat only drill cuttings, it is assumed that theunit will be operating only during the 20 days of actual drilling. Theequipment lease and energy costs are calculated accordingly. The costsfor operating these processes are essentially the same whether they areused to treat drill cuttings associated with oil-based drilling fluidsor water-based drilling fluids. These costs are summarized in Table 7.As described previously, a value of $26.50 per barrel is assigned to theoil recovered by the treatment process assuming recovered oil is suitablefor reuse in the drilling fluid system. These costing examples includethe assumption that all of the oil removed from the drilling wastes isrecovered for reuse.<ITAG tagnum="81">Oil-Based Cuttings.</ITAG>The drill cuttings from an oil-based mud are estimated to have a 20% oilcontent by weight (approx. 55% by volume); the volume of oil on the cuttingswould therefore be 792 barrels. The volume of oil remaining on the cuttingsafter treatment by thermal distillation to reduce the oil content to 1%by weight (approx. 2.8% by volume) would be 40 barrels. The value of therecovered oil would therefore be $19,900 (752 bblx$26.50). The volume ofoil remaining on the cuttings after treatment by solvent extraction whenreducing the oil content to 0.3% by weight (approx. 0.8% by volume) wouldbe 12 barrels. The value of the recovered oil would therefore be $20,700(780 bblx$26.50). Water-based Cuttings.The cuttings from a water-based mud are extimated to have a 1% oil contentby weight (approx. 2.8% by volume) and the volume of oil on the cuttingswould therefore be 40 barrels. There would be little, if any, expectedreduction in oil content where these wastes are subjected to treatmentby thermal distillation. The volume of oil remaining on the cuttings aftertreatment by solvent extraction when reducing the oil content to 0.3% byweight (approx. 0.8% by volume) would be 12 barrels. The value of the recoveredoil would therefore be $740 (28 bblx$26.50).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>7._<T4>Costs of Treatment for Drill Cuttings \1\</T4><H1>Procedure</H1><H1>Thermal distrillation TD-1 process</H1><H2>Cost/unit</H2><H2>Unit No.</H2><H2>Total cost</H2><H1>Thermal distrillation TD-2 Process</H1><H2>Cost/unit</H2><H2>Unit No.</H2><H2>Total cost</H2><H1>Solvent extraction SE process</H1><H2>Cost/unit</H2><H2>Unit No.</H2><H2>Total cost</H2><ITAG tagnum="21">Cuttings From Oil-Based Drilling Fluids</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Rental-drilling<D>4,000</D><D>Day 20</D><D>=$80,000</D><D>1,550</D><D>Day 20</D><D>=$31,000</D><D>4,200</D><D>Day 20</D><D>=$84,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Rental-no drill<D>1,500</D><D>Day 15</D><D>=22,500</D><D>1,500</D><D>Day 15</D><D>=23,250</D><D>2,000</D><D>Day 15</D><D>=30,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Energy cost<D>180</D><D>Day 20</D><D>=3,600</D><D>180</D><D>Day 20</D><D>=3,600</D><D>Included</D><D>Day 20</D><D>=0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Living cost<D>70</D><D>Day 35</D><D>=2,450</D><D>70</D><D>Day 35</D><D>=2,450</D><D>70</D><D>Day 35</D><D>=2,450</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Trans. to rig<D>750</D><D>Each 1</D><D>=750</D><D>750</D><D>Each 1</D><D>=750</D><D>750</D><D>Each 1</D><D>=750</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Rig set-up<D>2,500</D><D>Each 1</D><D>=2,500</D><D>2,500</D><D>Each 1</D><D>=2,500</D><D>2,500</D><D>Each 1</D><D>=2,500</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Rig tear-down<D>1,250</D><D>Each 1</D><D>=1,250</D><D>1,250</D><D>Each 1</D><D>=1,250</D><D>1,250</D><D>Each 1</D><D>=1,250</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Shore support<D>3,000</D><D>Each 1</D><D>=3,000</D><D>3,000</D><D>Each 1</D><D>=3,000</D><D>3,000</D><D>Each 1</D><D>=3,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Trans. to shore<D>750</D><D>Each 1</D><D>=750</D><D>750</D><D>Each 1</D><D>=750</D><D>750</D><D>Each 1</D><D>=750</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Weekly Trans<D>600</D><D>Each 5</D><D>=3,000</D><D>600</D><D>Each 5</D><D>=3,000</D><D>600</D><D>Each 5</D><D>=3,000</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total<D/><D/><D>119,800</D><D/><D/><D>71,550</D><D/><D/><D>127,700</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>For Oil Based Drilling Fluid</T4></ITAG>1,430 bbls drill cuttings treated:<ITAG tagnum="3">Cost of treatment</ITAG><D/><D/><D>=119,800</D><D/><D/><D>71,550</D><D/><D/><D>127,700</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Cost of treatment per barrel</ITAG><D/><D/><D>=84</D><D/><D/><D>50</D><D/><D/><D>89</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Value of recovered oil</ITAG><D/><D/><D>=19,900</D><D/><D/><D>19,900</D><D/><D/><D>20,600</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Net cost of treatment</ITAG><D/><D/><D>=99,900</D><D/><D/><D>51,650</D><D/><D/><D>107,100</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Net cost of treatment per barrel</ITAG><D/><D/><D>=70</D><D/><D/><D>36</D><D/><D/><D>75</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Cost of onshore disposal</ITAG><D/><D/><D>=66,400</D><D/><D/><D>66,400</D><D/><D/><D>66,400</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Onshore disposal cost \2\ per barrel</ITAG><D/><D/><D>=46</D><D/><D/><D>46</D><D/><D/><D>46</D><F>\1\ All three treatment units are assumed to take 20 days to process1,430 barrels of drill cuttings.</F><F>\2\ Onshore disposal costs assume rigs are retrofitted for cuttingsstorage.</F></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">D. Water-Based Drilling Fluids </ITAG>Cost estimates were prepared for the treatment of water-based drillingfluids in order to assess increased energy costs and processing times forthe treatment of drilling fluids as compared to drill cuttings. (The factorswhich may make the use of this technology to treat water-based fluids atan offshore oil facility less practicable than for treating drill cuttingsare described in Section V of this part of today's notice.) The costs of renting and operating the thermal distillation unit and thesolvent extraction unit over a 35 day drilling period, including auxiliarycosts, were estimated. It was assumed that in order to treat the largervolume of drilling fluids the unit will be required to process drillingfluids every day during the entire 35 day drilling period. The equipmentrental and energy costs were calculated accordingly. The average oil content of water-based drilling fluid is estimated to be5% oil by volume (approx. 2.5% by weight), when oil is added to the mudeither as a spotting fluid, a lubricity agent, and/or contains entrainedformation oil. The volume of oil in the 5349 barrels of drilling fluid(not including the active mud system) to be treated would therefore be267 barrels. The volume of oil remaining on the drilling fluids, aftertreatment by thermal distillation when reducing the oil content to 1% byweight (approx. 2% by volume), is 107 barrels. The value of the recoveredoil would therefore be $4300 (160 bblandmultiply;$26.50). The volume of oilremaining on the drilling fluids after treatment by solvent extractionwhen reducing the oil content to 0.3% by weight (approx. 0.6% by volume)is 32 barrels. The value of the recovered oil would therefore be $6,200(235 bblandmultiply;$26.50). <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Comparison of Onsite Treatment Costs with Onshore Disposal Costsfor Drilling Wastes </ITAG>The detailed costs are presented in the EPA report titled ``Costs, EnergyRequirements and Processing Rates for Treating Drilling Fluids and DrillCuttings using Thermal Distillation and Solvent and Solvent ExtractionProcesses'' which is available in the record of this rulemaking. Thesecosts are summarized on a ``per barrel of raw waste'' basis in Table 8below and are compared with transport to shore and land disposal costsof the wastes. The thermal distillation and solvent extraction technologycosts in Table 8 include a credit for recovered oil at an estimated economicvalue of $26.50 per barrel of oil. The transport/land disposal option costs are presented for three scenarios.These three scenarios are presented on the basis of the ability to storethe wastes during high seas or offload these wastes for transport to shoreas follows:1. For rigs with no storage space for drilling wastes, but designed forloading boats in seas with wave heights of up to 6 feet. If wave heightsexceeded 6 feet, drilling would have to cease for the period that the waveheights were in excess of 6 feet and supply boats were unable to tie upat the facility. 2. For rigs with no storage space for drilling wastes, but designed forloading boats in seas with wave heights of up to 10 feet. If wave heightsexceeded 10 feet, drilling would have to cease for the period that thewave heights were in excess of 10 feet and supply boats were unable totie up at the facility. 3. For rigs retrofitted for drilling wastes storage. These rigs could continueto drill even when supply boats were unable to tie-up at the facility.The costs for land disposal in Table 8 include onshore disposal costs,handling costs, container rental costs, transportation costs, and downtimecosts for rigs with no storage space or retrofit costs for rigs fittedwith storage space. Capital costs associated with retrofitting an offshorerig with sufficient storage capacity and deck space to accommodate storageof drilling wastes were estimated. These retrofit costs were apportionedamong the estimated number of wells drilled from a rig during a 5-yearestimated life of the rig equipment. These scenarios are based upon priorindustry-sponsored work submitted during the proposed comment period. TheAgency has reviewed the industry study documentation and found the informationto be reasonable for the purpose of establishing these scenarios. (Source:``Water-Based Drilling Fluids and Cuttings Disposal Options Survey'', Feb.1986, Walk Haydel and Associates). The transportation costs were based upon daily rental costs for supplyboats. These costs were not sensitive to the distance between the offshorefacility and the onshore transfer facility and disposal site. The rigswith no storage capacity were assumed to require two dedicated supply boatsthroughout the entire 35 day drilling period. The rigs retrofitted withstorage capacity were assumed to require two dedicated supply boats forthe first 18 days of the drilling period and one dedicated supply boatfor the remaining 17 days of the drilling period. (source: ``Water-BasedDrilling Fluids and Cuttings Disposal Option Survey'', Feb. 1986, WalkHaydel and Associates). The majority of operators would, in all probability, decide to retrofitrigs for drilling fluid storage since this would result in an overall lowercost for the disposal of drilling fluids. (source: ``Water-Based DrillingFluids and Cuttings Disposal Option Survey'', Feb. 1986, Walk Haydel andAssociates). The costs are lowered because supply boats would not be dedicatedsolely to drilling waste disposal. It was therefore estimated that 80%of the rigs would be retrofitted, 10% would operate using a maximum permissiblewave height of 10 feet and 10% would operate using a maximum permissiblewave height of 6 feet.

Performance Data<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Field Sampling</ITAG>During the period September 14 to 17, 1987, the Agency performed samplingof feed, waste and by-product streams associated with a thermal distillationunit (T-1 process) that was operating in the South Pass Block of the Gulfof Mexico. The thermal distillation unit was used to process cuttings generatedfrom a well drilled at an offshore facility in the Gulf of Mexico. Oil-basedmuds were utilized at the well from a depth of 4,900 feet to the bottomof the well at 13,944 feet. The diameter of the hole was 12.25 inches andthe well was being drilled at a rate of 140 feet per hour. Only a portionof the drill cuttings generated at this well were processed by the thermaldistillation unit. Due to the existing configuration of the rig cuttingscollection system, the raw cuttings feed was composed only of the cuttingsfrom the primary shale shaker.The following waste and by-product streams were generated by the particularthermal distillation unit that was tested: processed cuttings, condensedhydrocarbon, condensed water, air emissions. The processed cuttings weremixed with seawater and sluiced to discharge from the facility. The condensedvapors (oil/water) were directed to an oil/water separator which had twodischarge streams_a condensed hydrocarbon stream and a condensed waterstream. The treatment system also had a stack for air emissions.Samples were collected by EPS from the test unit over a four day samplingperiod. Samples were taken of the raw cuttings, the processed cuttingsand the combined processed cuttings/seawater stream. The oil content ofboth the raw cuttings feed and the processed cuttings was analyzed usingretort-gravimetric and soxhlet exrtaction methods. The oil content of thecombined seawater/cuttings stream was analyzed prior to discharge, usingthe gravimetric extraction method. The raw cuttings feed and the processedcuttings were analyzed for metals, priority organics, percentage solidsand for ICR/RCRA components (ICR tests are for ingnitability, corrosivityand reactivity; RCRA is the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act). Thecombined treated cuttings/seawater stream to be discharged was analyzedfor total suspended solids. Bioassay tests were performed on samples ofthe raw cuttings and the processed cuttings. Samples were also taken ofthe condensed hydrocarbon and water streams. These samples were analyzedfor oil content using the gravimetric extraction method, and for priorityorganics. Samples of the condensed water discharge stream were also analyzedfor total suspended solids.Temperature measurements and pH readings were taken of the selected rawwaste, treated waste and by-product streams. Tests for settleable solidsin the raw cuttings, the condensed water stream, the combined treated cuttings/seawaterstream and in background seawater were conducted at the facility. Air samplingof the thermal unit emissions was not possible due to the unavailabilityof air sampling personnel during the sampling effort.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Observations and Sampling Results</ITAG>During the sampling program, the vendor demonstrated the ability to setup and run a thermal distillation unit on an offshore development facilityto treat drill cuttings associated with oil-based muds.The average oil content of the raw cuttings was found to be 7.11% by weightusing soxhlet extraction analysis and 5.82% by weight using the retort-gravimetricmethod. The raw cuttings were considerably lower in oil content than expectedfor the type of mud being used. This was probably because the only sourceof cuttings used as feed to the test unit was the primary shale shaker.The cuttings from the primary shale shaker are physically the largest cuttingsin the entire cuttings recovery system. The smaller, finer cuttings fromthe secondary shaker, the desilter and the contrifuge sections of the cuttingsrecovery system would have the higher oil content due to their higher surfacearea. A composite sample of all of the cuttings generated at the well wouldbe expected to have an oil content of 15% to 20% by weight (source: EPAestimate; Conoco, Inc. estimate).The thermal distillation unit was shown, when operating properly, to beable to consistently reduce the oil content of drill cuttings, separatedfrom an oil-based mud at the primary shale shaker, to less than 1% by weight(less than 2.8% by volume). The processed cuttings were dry and granularin appearance. The results from the sampling episode therefore indicatethat the thermal distillation unit tested could achieve a significant reductionin the oil content of drill cuttings. The results of oil analyses of samples of raw and treated wastes and by-productstreams are presented in Table 9.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table 9._Thermal Distillation of Drill Cuttings (Oil-Based Mud), AverageOil Content, Percent by Weight</T4><H1> </H1><H1>Soxhlet method \1\</H1><H1>Retort-gravimetric method \2\</H1><H1>Gravimetric method \3\</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Raw cuttings<D>7.11</D><D>5.82</D><D>Not appr.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Proc. cuttings<D>0.06</D><D>0.53</D><D>Not appr.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Combined seawater/cuttings<D>Not appr.</D><D>Not appr.</D><D>0.06.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Condensed hydrocarbons<D>Not appr.</D><D>Not appr.</D><D>97.4.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Condensed water<D>Not appr.</D><D>Not appr.</D><D>0.06.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sea water<D>Not appr.</D><D>Not appr.</D><D>0.003.</D><F/><T2>Notes: </T2><F>``Not Appr.'' indicates that a particular analytical method was notan appropriate analytical method for type of waste stream sampled.</F><F>\1\ Method 503D, Oil andamp; Grease, Extraction Method for Sludge Samples.Standard Method for the Examination of Water and Wastewaters; APHA, AWWA,WPCF; 16th Edition, 1985.</F><F>\2\ Proposed Method 1651, Total Oil and Diesel Oil in Drilling Fluidsand Drill Cuttings by Retort Gravimetry and GCFID.

The SPP was prepared by mixing the drill cuttings withseawater (1:9 by volume), allowing the mixture to settle for 1 hour, anddecanting the SPP. Three subsamples of one sample of raw cuttings weretested. The 96-hour LC50s were 3.2%, 8.5% and 1.5% SPP. Two samples ofprocessed cuttings were tested; the 96-hour LC50s were 28.7% and 27.9%SPP.Samples of the raw cuttings, processed cuttings, condensed hydrocarbonsand condensed water were analyzed for organics. A total of ten (10) samples_oneraw cuttings, four processed cuttings, one condensed hydrocarbon and fourcondensed water_were each analyzed for two hundred and thirty-four (234)organics.Twenty-eight organic compounds were detected at concentrations above theirdetection limits in some or all of the samples. The remaining two hundredsix organics compounds were either not detected or were quantified at alevel below the method detection limit.Detailed discussion and results of this sampling program are presentedin the EPA document titled ``Report on the Results of Field Sampling orThermal Dynamics Inc. Treatment of Drill Cuttings on Conoco South Pass75 Platform September 14-17th, 1987''. This report is part of the recordof this rulemaking and is available for inspection as described in the``addresses'' section of this notice.VII. Oil Content or Untreated Drilling WastesThis section presents a summary of the Agency's estimates of the quantitiesof untreated drill cuttings and water-based drilling fluids that wouldnot meet an oil content effluent limitation of 1% or less (weight basis).These estimated quantities of drilling wastes would either require treatmentto comply with an oil content limitation or, alternatively, the wastescould be disposed of in another manner such as by transport to shore forland disposal at an acceptable waste disposal site.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Drill Cuttings</ITAG>Oil-Based Cuttings. All drill cuttings associated with oil-based drillingfluids would require treatment or land disposal to comply with an oil contentlimitation of 1% or less (weight basis). Water-based Cuttings.Based upon the waste characteristics described above for the model situation,little if any of drill cuttings associated with water-based drilling fluidswhich contain oil added either as a lubricity agent or as a spotting fluidwould likely require treatment to comply with an oil content limitation.Some portion of drill cuttings associated with water-based drilling fluidsto which no oil has been added (lubricity, spotting) may require treatmentor land disposal to comply with an oil content limitation. This would bedue to entrained formation oils in the drilling fluid system which in turncould adhere to the drill cuttings wastes. The Agency has no estimate ofdrilling waste volumes that would fall into this scenario (drilling wastesor drill cuttings). For the purposes of this analysis, the Agency assumeda zero quantity of drilling wastes in this scenario. The Agency solicitsspecific information which would allow for a reasonable estimate to bemade of these drilling waste volumes.The results of an industry survey indicate that approximately 12% of allwells drilled with water-based muds have oil added to the mud system forlubricity purposes. (source: Shell Oil, Burgbacher, 1985). As discussedpreviously, the drill cuttings generated under these circumstances areestimated to contain 1% oil by weight. (EPA estimate). For this analysisthen, most if not all drill cuttings from wells drilled with water-basedmuds are estimated to have a oil content of 1% by weight and thus wouldnot require treatment or land disposal to meet an oil content limitationof 1% by weight.In summary, drill cuttings from water-based muds to which (mineral) oilhas been added for lubricity and/or spotting purposes would likely notrequire treatment or land disposal to comply with an oil content limitationof 1% by weight.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Water-Based Drilling Fluids</ITAG>Water-based drilling fluids which contain oil added either as a lubricityagent or as a spotting fluid, or containing formation hydrocarbons in appreciableamounts would likely require treatment to comply with an oil content limitationin the range of 1% or less (weight basis).Historical information supplied by the industry indicates that approximately12% of all wells drilled with water-based muds can be expected to use oilas a lubricity agent (source: API). The amount of lubricity oil used variesfrom about 1% to 12% (volume basis), with an estimated average of 3%. This,all drillings fluids generated from such wells would require either treatmentto reduce the oil content prior to discharge or transport to shore forland disposal to comply with an oil content limitation. (Source: 1986 APIDrilling Fluids Survey.)The results of a recent survey conducted by the Offshore Operators Committeeindicate that approximately 22% of wells drilled with water-based mudscan be expected to use oil as a spotting fluid (1986 Offshore OperatorsCommittee Spotting Fluid Survey). Water-based drilling fluid to which oilis added as a spotting fluid at depths below 8,000 feet would likely containoil in excess of 1% by weight, and thus would either have to be processedfor removal of oil and then discharged or transported to shore for disposal.(The EPA model case use of oil added as a spotting fluid below a depthof 8,000 feet was estimated for model well characteristics.)The total volume of drilling fluid to be handled from a 10,000 foot wellis estimated to be 6749 barrels (including the active mud system), of whichapproximately 2076 barrels (including the active mud system) are generatedbetween 8,000 feet and 10,000 feet (source: ``Alternate Disposal Methodsfor Mud and Cutting for the Gulf of Mexico and Georges Bank'', Dec. 1981,Offshore Operators Committee). Thus, the percentage of all water-baseddrilling fluids used which would contain oil as a spotting fluid is estimatedto be 6.8% (22% x 2076 bbl/6749 bbl).Assuming, conservatively for aggregate costing purposes, that there isno overlap in the population of wells using oil as a lubricity agent andthose using oil as a spotting fluid, an estimated total of 18.8% by volumeof all water-based drilling fluids would require onsite treatment of onshoredisposal to comply with an oil content limitation as discussed above.VIII. Analytical Method for Total Oil ContentA method for retort distillation and gravimetry for determining the totaloil content of drilling fluid and drill cuttings waste streams is publishedas part of today's notice for review and comment. The Agency has determinedthat existing approved analytical methods for measuring oil are not appropriatefor drilling wastes and that the oil content method appearing in AppendixA of this notice is the appropriate test procedure.This same method (Proposed Method 1651, ``Total Oil and Diesel Oil in DrillingMuds and Drill Cuttings by Retort Gravimetry and GCFID'') includes additionalsteps for determining the identity and concentration of diesel oil, andis presented in its entirety in Appendix A of this notice.The retort distillation method has been widely used by the industry fortesting drilling muds and is simple to perform on offshore facilities inremote conditions. The version of the method presented in Appendix A hasan estimated detection limit of 200 mg/kg (0.02% by weight). Documentationon precision and accuracy measurements of the test method is included inthe record for this rulemaking.IX. Request for CommentsAs previously stated, the Agency is considering a BAT and NSPS oil contentlimitation of up to 1.0% by weight for drill cuttings associated with eitheroil-based or water-based drilling fluids. Such a limitation may be basedupon attainable performance of the control and treatment technologies discussedin this notice and prior notices pertaining to this rulemaking. The Agencysolicits comment on all aspects of such a BAT and NSPs oil content limitationfor control of priority and toxic non-conventional pollutants in the hydrocarbonspresent in drill cuttings. This limitation would apply to all drill cuttingsdischarges to surface waters, whether or not oil is added to the associateddrilling fluid system. Moreover, for cuttings asssociated with oil-basedmuds, this oil content limitation would replace the prohibition on thedischarge of such cuttings. The Agency particularly solicits comment on:(1) Whether such an oil content limitation is appropriate for drill cuttings;(2) the appropriate technology basis for an oil content limitation; and(3) whether an oil content limitation should apply in addition to or insteadof one or more of the other limitations and standards for drill cuttingspresented in Part 1 of this notice.The Agency also invites comment on all aspects of establishing BAT andNSPS oil content limitations for water-based drilling fluids. The Agencyparticularly solicits comment on the practicality and technical achievabilityof processing water-based drilling fluids by these technologies at offshoredrilling sites and on the issue of space constraints with regard to installingthese systems at offshore facilities.The Agency solicits comment on the model drilling scenarios selected foranalysis, the costs to implement the treatment technologies and treatmentmethods discussed in this part, and on any actual and foreseeable problemsregarding adequate onshore disposal sites for drilling wastes. The Agencyalso invites comment on the extent to which the oil content and the toxicityof drill cuttings and drilling fluids is due to downhole contamination.The Agency also invites comment on the applicability of these technologiesto drilling wastes from Alaskan coastal and offshore facilities.Some of the technologies discussed in this part of today's notice haveair emissions associated with the operation of the processes. The Agencyhas obtained some air emissions characterization data on these technologies,but does not have sufficient information to properly consider the non-waterquality aspects of these technologies. The Agency solicits additional emissionscharacterization data from the operation of these technologies.As indicated by the analytical method for oil content determinations presentedin Appendix A of today's notice, the Agency's preferred method for oilcontent determinations for wastes containing high solids content (<T3>i.e.,</T3> drill cuttings, drilling fluids) is the ``retort-gravimetric''method. The Agency requests that any commenters that intend to supply theAgency with performance data on drilling fluid or drill cuttings treatmenttechnologies provide oil content determinations based upon the retort-gravimetricmethod presented in Appendix A below.<ITAG tagnum="56">Appendix A_Proposed Method 1651_Oil Content and Diesel Oil in DrillingMuds and Drill Cuttings by Retort Gravimetry and GCFID</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">1 Scope and Application</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">1.1 This method is used to determine the oil content and the identityand concentration of diesel oil in drilling fluid (mud) samples.

The extract is evaporated to dryness,and the total amount of oil is redissolved in methylene chloride, an internalstandard is added, and an aliquot is injected into a gas chromatograph(GC). The components of the oil are separated by the GC and detected usinga flame ionization detector (FID).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">2.2 Identification of diesel oil (qualitative analysis) is performedby comparing the pattern of GC peaks (retention times and intensities)from the sample extract with the pattern of GC peaks from a reference dieseloil sample. Identification of diesel oil is established when the referencediesel and sample patterns agree per the criteria in this method.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">2.3 Quantitative analysis of diesel oil is performed using an internalstandard technique.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">3 Contamination and Interferences</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">3.1 Solvents, reagents, glassware and other sample processing hardwaremay yield artifacts and/or elevated baselines causing misinterpretationof chromatograms. All material shall be demonstrated to be free from interferencesunder the conditions of the analysis by running method blanks initiallyand with set of samples. Specific selection of reagents and purificationof solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required. Glasswareand, where possible, reagents are cleaned by solvent rinse or baking at450 degree C for one hour minimum.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">3.2 There is no standard diesel oil. Oil components, as seen by GC-FID,will differ depending upon the oil source, the production date, productionprocess, and the producer. In addition, there are three basic types ofdiesel oils: ASTM Designations No. 1-D, No. 2-D, and No. 4-D. The No. 2-Dis most common ``diesel oil''; however, No. 2-D is sometimes blended withNo. 1-D which has a lower boiling range. For rigorous identification andquantification of diesel oil in a drilling fluid sample by GC-FID, thechromatographic pattern from the diesel oil should be matched with thechromatographic pattern from a reference standard of the same diesel oilsuspected to be in the sample.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">3.3 To aid in the identification of interferences, the chromatographicpattern from a reference sample of drilling fluid prior to use is comparedto the chromatographic pattern of the drilling fluid after use. An interferenceis present when the pattern of the background oil does not match, but contributessubstantially to, the pattern of the diesel oil in the sample.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">3.4 Mineral oils are often added to drilling fluids for lubricity.These oils when examined by GC-FID , contain some components common todiesel oil but have chromatographic patterns that are distinctly differentfrom diesel oil. The analyst must first determine if the sample chromatogramshows the presence of diesel, mineral, or a combination of both beforereliable quantification can be performed. This method permits selectionof GC peaks unique to diesel oil for determination of diesel oil in thepresence of mineral oil.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">4 Safety</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">4.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this methodhas not been defined.
