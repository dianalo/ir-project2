Headings were driven in reconsolidated caving rubble beneathgoafs of longwalls worked with caving, and in the coal body itself. Thetest site was in seam 382 in the Bogdanka mine at a depth of 920 m. Geologicand technical conditions are described. Measurements were made at V29arched supports. Four diagrams are given comparing horizontal and verticalconvergences in headings with open or closed supports, driven by blastingor by heading machines. The lowest vertical convergence was in the goaf.Vertical convergence in a heading equipped with closed supports and drivenin a coal body was 55 cm (12%) compared to 15 cm (3.5%) in the goaf.In the case of open supports, vertical convergence was 175 cm (53%) inthe coal body after 200 days, while it was 65 cm (20%) in the goaf. Underconditions prevailing in the Lublin coal basin, vertical convergenceis on the average twice as high as horizontal convergence. If the resultsobtained are confirmed in practice, it will be possible to use them inplanning exploitation, thereby facilitating the maintenance of headings.</TEXT></DOC>
