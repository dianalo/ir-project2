Riot police fitted with helmets, shields and sticks closed100-acre Tianamen Square, the students' destination at the centerof Beijing. Truckloads of police were parked along the square,about nine miles southeast of the campus area where the march began.   ``Police get out of the way, people's police belong to thepeople,'' the students shouted as they pressed through a barricadeof about 300 police at a major intersection in northwest Beijing.   Student leaders urged youths from dozens of Beijing universitiesto march to Tiananmen Square, the symbolic center of China, toprotest harsh government statements condemning their 11-day-oldcampaign for democracy.   Government officials, in mass meetings Wednesday, declared thedemonstrations illegal. Beijing Communist Party Secretary Li Ximingtold a special meeting of 10,000 city party officials, ``We mustfirmly stop such riots.''   However, by noon, the marchers had pushed through three policeblockades set up along the route. Authorities gave way, and therewere no injuries.   ``It was like watching an iron bar bend'' one bystander said,describing the police retreats. When three truckloads of armedpolice pulled up at an intersection, it was surrounded by a crowdshouting, ``People love the people's police, the people's policelove people.''   Students with arms linked sang the national anthem and shouted``long live democracy'' as they headed down the main road fromtheir campuses to the square. Others shouted ``down withbureaucracy, down with corruption.''   Students reported that thousands of troops had massed near theBeijing Normal University along the student route toward the centerof the city.   ``I already know that I might die today. I am prepared,'' saidone student.   Thousands of bystanders along the street shouted ``Get out ofthe way!'' and ``Don't beat them!'' when police temporarily blockedthe students at one intersection.   Along the route, thousands of people leaned out windows andapplauded the students. Doctors and patients in bathrobes from alocal hospital grabbed for pamphlets the students were handing out.   A Chinese journalist speaking on condition of anonymity said thegovernment moves against the protest were made by order of seniorleader Deng Xiaoping to stop the students' campaign againstofficial corruption and for sweeping democratic reforms such as afree press.   ``The peasants support us, the workers support us, the armysupports us, so why should we be bothered by students?'' thejournalist quoted Deng as saying Tuesday. The journalist, from theofficial People's Daily, spoke on condition of anonmyity.   Spurred by the April 15 death of ousted Communist Party chief HuYaobang, a reformer, tens of thousands of students marchedrepeatedly to Tiananmen Square last week. They held unprecedentedsit-ins outside government and party headquarters in the largeststudent protest in four decades of Communist rule.   More than 70,000 students from 41 Beijing schools began a classboycott Monday. They have demanded that 84-year-old Deng step down,and they want Premier Li Peng to open a dialogue with them.   Loudspeakers at Beijing University appealed to the studentsThursday, ``We urge you to think what kind of problems will ariseif you leave the university. Think what kind of effect this willhave on your family and parents.''   But the students have won widespread support from Beijingresidents, who have donated more than $8,000 to their campaign.   Huge crowds have flocked to read the students' posters, and manypeople have expressed agreement in unprecedented street-sidepolitical debates.   In front of the People's University, one middle-aged man toldseveral dozen listeners Wednesday he had canceled his newspapersubscriptions.   ``There's no point reading them, all the papers are the same,''he said. Shanghai officials announced they had dismissed the editorof Shanghai's weekly World Economic Herald, China's most outspokennewspaper, and would reorganize it.</TEXT></DOC>
