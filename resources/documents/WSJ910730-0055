In the 1980s, when the East and West coasts werepropelling the economy, the Midwest looked just a bit likeEastern Europe. It was the &quot;Rust Belt,&quot; a vast disaster ofoutmoded factories and shrinking rural communities. Itsfuture seemed so dim that as recently as 1988, RichardCeleste, then the governor of Ohio, warned other Midwesterngovernors: &quot;We're confronted by a profound bi-coastal bias.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   But look at what's happening now.   The coasts are in a slump. Their financial-services,computer and defense industries are struggling, theirreal-estate markets in a downspin. No one quite knows whenthey will bounce back.   The Midwest, meanwhile, is bulldozing ahead. Itsdiversified manufacturing base is basking in an export surgethat is one of the few bright spots in the economy. Itsservice sector, banks and high-tech companies are reasonablyhealthy. Even most farmers expect a decent year.   Prices of single-family homes sank on both coasts lastyear, but they rose 4% in the Midwest. In California and NewEngland, retail sales fell in the 1991 first quarter, but inthe 13-state region stretching from Ohio to Nebraska, theyrose nearly 1%. Unemployment is higher on the coasts, andfive of the nine states with unemployment rates below 5% arein the middle of the country: Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, NorthDakota and South Dakota.   Indeed, pick a current problem on the coasts, and in theMidwest it's an asset. California is thirsty for water; theMidwest has the world's largest freshwater supply. TheNortheast lacks economic diversity; the Midwest has it inspades.   So if Midwesterners are gloating a bit these days, it'sprobably only fair after the years of abuse. &quot;We have a shineon the Rust Belt,&quot; boasts Edmund A. Schroer, chairman ofNipsco Industries Inc., a utility serving northern Indiana.Adds Indianapolis Mayor William Hudnut: &quot;Steady like thetortoise, we moved ahead. Maybe we're better off than some ofthose who cast their lot with the jackrabbit.&quot;   The nation's midsection still has sore spots, of course.Detroit suffers from an auto slump only beginning to showsigns of ending. St. Louis has lost aerospace jobs and soonwill lose even the corporate headquarters of one of itslargest companies, General Dynamics Corp. A recent governmentreport showed that the growth in nonfarm personal income inthe first quarter slowed in the Midwest along with otherregions. And although farmers' net income reached a record$47 billion last year, it's expected to decline slightly thisyear.   But compared with the coasts, the Midwest has fared muchbetter throughout the recession. &quot;We don't have theexcesses,&quot; says Iowa Gov. Terry Bransted, speaking by phonewhile on a trade mission in Austria. &quot;If you're looking notto just make a quick buck but for long-term, sustainedgrowth, the Midwest is a good place.&quot;   The Midwest's comeback may be as much a frame of mind asit is positive economic indicators. Certainly the mood shiftin the nation, from the conspicuous consumption of the 1980sto the more homespun values of the 1990s, has gone theMidwest's way. Whether in Iowa cornfields or Chicago officebuildings, its people, who make up one-fifth of the nation'spopulation, are often to work by 7 a.m.   Conservative values play just fine in places such asPeoria, where the median house price in the first quarter was$48,400, about $7,000 less than a 1991 Cadillac Allante.&quot;What the Midwest has to offer is catching on,&quot; says BishopJohn J. Myers of Peoria's Roman Catholic diocese.   The Midwest's recovery, like its people, appears steadyand sure-footed. Dun andamp; Bradstreet says that through May,business bankruptcies were down in only six states, half ofthem in the Midwest -- Ohio, Iowa and North Dakota. And,while Standard andamp; Poor's has put Illinois bonds on creditwatch, the ratings agency has already downgraded the debt offive Northeastern states.   &quot;You're feeling good if you're in the Midwest these days,&quot;says Diane Swonk, a First Chicago Corp. economist. Sheexpects the region to continue to outpace the overall economymodestly as the nation emerges from the recession. FirstChicago itself is shrinking its work force by 1,000 employeesand cutting back on its large corporate loans around thecountry. But the bank is beefing up its business in theChicago area.   Investors have taken note as well. Since the beginning ofthe year, an index of 80 Midwestern stocks tracked by DainBosworth Inc., a Minneapolis brokerage firm, has surged 30%-- twice the increases in the Dow Jones Industrial Averageand the Sandamp;P 500-stock index.   The U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration says three ofthe top five states in the growth of foreign tourism are inthe Midwest. McCann-Erickson, an advertising agency that'spart of Interpublic Group, wants to reopen the Chicago officeit closed in 1982. In the Midwest &quot;there's an awful lot ofbusiness, and we're not even in the game,&quot; worries JohnDooner, president of the agency's North American operation.   Midwest Living, a magazine published in Des Moines, Iowa,is light on news but big on things to eat and places tovisit, and the formula works. In the midst of the worstmagazine slump in years, its ad revenue jumped 30% last year,helping the monthly earn a spot on Adweek magazine's list ofthe 10 hottest magazines with circulation under one million.   It's enough to lure back some former Midwesterners. InOmaha, Neb., where the 2.9% unemployment rate is one of thelowest among U.S. cities, a hot topic at Central HighSchool's 1959 class reunion was who had returned and whowanted to return. The chamber of commerce is getting more andmore calls and letters from former Nebraskans in search ofjobs back home. &quot;I'm willing to accept almost any kind ofwork,&quot; writes one from Lakeland, Fla.   Duncan and Anne McMahon happily returned to Whitefish Bay,Wis., after a twoyear stint in the Boston area. There, theyfound high living costs and people in perpetual motion. Mr.McMahon recalls driving 75 miles an hour on the expressway toBoston, and, as a car passed him on the left shoulder, itsdriver accosting him with an obscene gesture. &quot;Everything wasa pain in the tush,&quot; Mr. McMahon says.   When Leslie Lenkowsky was offered the presidency of theHudson Institute, an Indianapolis think tank, the decision tomove from Washington, D.C., &quot;was the easiest part of thecalculation.&quot; He got what he expected. The eighth-grade classof his older son &quot;adopted&quot; a GI during the Persian Gulf War.&quot;It's those values we wanted our kids to know about,&quot; Mr.Lenkowsky says.   And many people who have moved to the center of thecountry aren't eager to return to the frenzied pace of thecoasts. It took Barry Griswell, an insurance executive, solong to commute between his job in New York City and his homein New Jersey that he coached his son's baseball team in hisbusiness suit. Since his 1988 move to Des Moines, the commuteto his job at the Principal Financial Group takes only 15minutes, and he and his wife have more time to spend withtheir two sons, aged 11 and 14. &quot;I think this is home forus,&quot; Mr. Griswell says. &quot;It's better than we thought.&quot;   Some Midwesterners concede that other areas have things tooffer -- sort of. Patrick Moran, the mayor of Kenosha, Wis.,took his family on vacation to Washington, D.C., and New Yorkto teach his children that &quot;what makes this country great isits people.&quot; But he can't help adding, &quot;The best people arefrom the Midwest.&quot;   Some are downright cocky. A current Old Style beer adcampaign has a detective sniffing out New Yorkers andCalifornians and kicking them out of a bar. &quot;It's our greatbeer, and they can't have it,&quot; the detective snarls.   Even vacation-home sales, hit hard nationally, look betterin the midsection. In Missouri's Lake of the Ozarks area,Peter Brown says sales of his condominiums, boosted by a cutin prices and frills, were up fourfold in the second quarterfrom a year earlier. No ocean? No problem. The area billsitself as the &quot;Midwest Coast.&quot; Mr. Brown says evenCalifornians have begun to snap up condos and lots on hiscompany's properties. &quot;It's calm and nice, and you don't haveall the kooks running around,&quot; he says. Looking ahead, he iscounting on aging baby boomers to buy there, too.   But there's more to the Midwest's comeback than shiftingcultural whims. Farmers who survived the 1980s have paid offdebt and made their farms more efficient. Indianapolisfashioned itself as an amateur sports capital. Minneapolisbuilt a reputation as a center of the medical-equipmentindustry. Omaha became the place for handling toll-free phonecalls.   Many cities also discovered that despite the 1980sobituaries, manufacturing wasn't dead after all. Two yearsago, unemployment in Kenosha surged to 10% after ChryslerCorp. closed a factory with 5,000 workers. The southeasternWisconsin city of 80,000 set out to diversify. Today, itsindustrial park has 22 tenants, up from four just three yearsago. Unemployment in June was at 6.8%, just under thenational rate of 7%.   Rockford, Ill., the nation's &quot;fastener capital,&quot; literallystuck to nuts and bolts. It also found ways to sell more ofthem abroad. In 1984, in an effort to increase the area'sexports, its business leaders provided an office and asecretary for an International Trade Administration officialto set up shop in the area. The official, Tom de Seve,teaches a course on exporting at a local community collegeand gives seminars to officials of small and medium-sizedcompanies.   Mr. de Seve says he has helped 84 companies ship productsabroad for the first time and 295 others enter new foreignmarkets. Together, the businesses generated some $152 millionin new export orders. In June, the area's unemployment ratewas 7.9%, compared with 20% in November 1982.   Officials in some places complain that their comeback isbeing ignored. &quot;We still get people calling from the coastalcities wanting to know if we have indoor plumbing or when thekazoo concert begins,&quot; gripes Lee Lewellen of theIndianapolis chamber. Omaha's chamber surveyed chiefexecutives nationwide and found they have neither negativenor positive feelings about the city. &quot;They just don't thinkof it,&quot; says Vicki Krecek, a chamber official. &quot;That's a realproblem for us.&quot;   Another problem is separating people from quaint notions.When the ABC-TV show Good Morning America stopped in Omaha ona Midwestern tour in May, a film crew wanted a shot of a cownext to a modern building. They settled for a shot of two inthe stockyards.   When Brent Backhaus accepted a job last year at Deere andamp;Co.'s factory in Ottumwa, Iowa, a fellow graduate from theMassachusetts Institute of Technology wondered aloud why hewanted to work on lawn mowers. In fact, he's working on thelatest designs for farm equipment.   Today, Deere suffers from a sales slowdown. But withdefense and computer companies constantly laying off workers,Mr. Backhaus is glad he passed up offers from the coasts. &quot;Ikind of pat myself on the back once in a while,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
