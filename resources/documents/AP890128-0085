ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ron Brown says he will not pick a fight withJesse Jackson to demonstrate his independence as the new Democraticparty chairman, but that there are bound to be conflicts with thepresidential candidate he worked for in 1988.   ``I'm not looking for it, trying to orchestrate it,'' Brown saidin an interview last week in advance of succeeding Paul G. Kirk Jr.in the party post. ``I'm sure at one time or another I'll have theopportunity to demonstrate independence from any of the potentialcandidates in `92.''   Brown's election to the party chairmanship was assured last weekwhen three of his four rivals for the post dropped out and endorsedhim. Only former Rep. Jim Jones of Oklahoma continued his challenge,but there was near unanimous agreement within the party that Brownwill be a sure winner when the Democratic National Committee votesFeb. 10.   John Henry Anderson, the Georgia Democratic Party chairman whohad supported one of Brown's rivals, said there was ``no doubt'' inhis mind that Brown would win.   To overcome the perception that the incoming chairman is tooliberal, Anderson said Brown must ``establish his independence fromany groups and find us a candidate in four years who will appeal tothe broad base of the electorate.''   Opponents of the Washington lawyer-lobbyist, who will be thefirst black politician to hold the top party post, cited his ties toJackson, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and Gov. Mario Cuomo as evidence hewould give ammunition to those trying to paint the Democrats as tooliberal.   ``What does it take to help us win?'' Brown asked rhetorically.``It doesn't have anything to do with the ideology of the chairman.(That is) a totally irrelevant consideration.   ``We have fallen into a trap of allowing our enemies, ouropponents or adversaries to define us. I think it's time for us todefine ourselves and let the American people know what it means tobe a Democrat.''   He said the party must do a better job defining its positions onnational security, crime and drugs.   ``We've got to get out of the box of having some people in thiscountry believe that we are the party that blames America foreverything that's wrong in the world,'' said Brown.   He said Congress would be the principal shaper of the partymessage and that he hoped to participate in leadership discussionson Capitol Hill.   Brown described himself as ``one of the several messengers thathave the ability and skills to be a strong advocate.''   He rejected the advice of many party activists that he must takesome symbolic action to demonstrate his independence.   ``I don't believe that,'' he said. ``I've passed the test. I'vebeen judged to be a fair and reasonable and common sense person.That's why it looks like we're going to have a celebration here inFebruary instead of a fight.''   At the same time, he said, ``I am very sensitive to concerns thatpeople have raised about perception.''   Brown said he would travel to the South soon ``and go to somestatehouses and meet with governors and Democratic Party leaders todemonstrate that I want to reach out.''   In the closing weeks of the campaign for the Democraticpresidential nomination, Brown agreed to become convention managerfor Jackson and some party activists are concerned about theperception that he is a Jackson partisan, a perception he says isincorrect.   When asked whether he felt he must do something to demonstrateindependence from Jackson, Brown replied: ``We've got to stoptreating Jesse like some kind of irrational being. He's areasonable, rational political figure, political leader.''   Brown continued: ``I think he understands full well there mightbe times the next four years where we disagree on something; whereby the nature of my position and my role and the nature of hisposition and his role, it just makes sense that we'd be on differentsides and I don't know that's going to be such a traumatic thing.''</TEXT></DOC>
