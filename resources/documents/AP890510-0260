Pressure is growing, especially inthe Congress, for new trade strategies to achieve quickerresults,'' said James D. Robinson III, who is also chairman of theAdvisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations.   ``Old remedies to alter the trade imbalance haven't worked,''Robinson told reporters at the Japan National Press Club.   American firms, disappointed with a lack of progress inpenetrating Japan's market, also have increased pressure for fasterresults in trade negotiations, said Robinson, American Express'schairman and chief executive.   ``The mood in the business community is changing. ... Companiesare not finding the opportunities they expected. ... So, they arebecoming increasingly active and vocal in criticizing barriers tosales in Japan,'' Robinson said.   While U.S. efforts to reduce trade imbalances with Europeannations through exchange rate manipulations and other methods havebegun to work, the trade deficit with Japan remains stubbornlyhigh, Robinson said.   In 1988, the United States posted a $52 billion trade deficitwith Japan, down slightly from the $59.8 billion deficit in 1987,according to U.S. figures.   Japan tops the list of 34 countries that U.S. TradeRepresentative Carla Hills, in a recent report, said have erectedsignificant trade barriers against U.S. products. If negotiationsfail to eliminate trade barriers the United States deems unfair,those nations could become targets for trade sanctions.   Adding to pressure for trade action is a popular belief thatJapanese investors are ``buying up America,'' Robinson said. ``ManyAmerians see Japan as a threat to the United States.''   He added: ``The erroneous public perception and relatedemotional backlash clearly must be addressed.''   To help ease public concern, Japanese corporations should avoidconcentrating their investment in specific areas and should do moreto demonstrate a sense of corporate responsibility and commitmentto American communities, Robinson said.   Robinson suggested using business-to-business dialogue to tackledifficult ``informal trade barriers such as the wholesale andretail distribution system and traditional sourcing patterns.''   ``It's time for our two business communities to work together toidentify practical ways of addressing unsustainable imbalances,''he said.   ``I believe, very strongly, that business leadership ... canmake a positive contribution to resolving issues before they becomeissues that require action and retaliation,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
