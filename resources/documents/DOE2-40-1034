Thesubjects addressed include: role and status of earth science field work;phase relations of prealuminous granitic rocks and their petrogeneticimplications; chondritic meteorites and the solar nebula; volcanic winters;mass wasting on continental margins; earthquake ground motions; ore depositsas guides to geologic history of the earth; geology of high-level nuclearwaste disposal; and tectonic evolution of the Caribbean. Also discussedare: the earth's rotation; the geophysics of a restless caldera (LongValley, California); observations of cometary nuclei; geology of Venus;seismic stratigraphy; in situ-produced cosmogenic isotopes in terrestrialrocks; time variations of the earth's magnetic field; deep slabs, geochemicalheterogeneity, and the large-scale structure of mantle convection; earlyproterozoic assembly and growth of Laurentia; concepts and methods ofhigh-resolution event stratigraphy.</TEXT></DOC>
