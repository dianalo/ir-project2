No. 88-1393 (Dec. 22, 1988), 54 FR 155 (Jan. 4, 1989).The final rule grandfathers such investments, however, in a manner consistentwith the savings clause of the current equity-risk investment regulation,<T3>see</T3> 12 CFR 563.9-8(f) (1988). Such grandfathering covers boththe threshold and diversification requirements of the equity-risk investmentrule. <T3>See</T3> 12 CFR 563.9-8(c)(2), (e)(1) (1988). The rule also adds suchinvestments to the list of permissible equity-risk investments.Legislation currently pending before Congress may, if enacted, affect theability of certain insured institutions to invest in equity-risk investments.Nevertheless, these anticipated changes do not affect the need for thesubstantive amendments made by this rule.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>September 18, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Richard M.

Institutions wishing to invest moreheavily in such assets are required to obtain prior supervisory approval.<T3>See</T3> 12 CFR 563.9-8(g)(1). The definitional section of the regulation,12 CFR 563.9-8(b), sets forth which types of assets are included in, orexcluded from, such investments and thus counted toward the thresholds.On December 23, 1988, the Board proposed to remove the exclusion from thedefinition of ``equity security'' in 12 CFR 563.9-8(b)(2) for stock issuedby Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased by insured institutions on or afterDecember 14, 1988. 54 FR at 156. All stock purchased prior to that datewould have continued to be excluded in full, i.e., not counted in any waytoward an insured institution's equity-risk investment threshold, as setforth at 12 CFR 563.9-8(c)(2). 54 FR at 157.Moreover, under the proposal, stock issued by those instrumentalities,as well as by other, similar, United States government-sponsored corporationswould be expressly authorized as investments for purposes of the equity-riskinvestment rule, pursuant to 12 CFR 563.9-8(d)(1). <T3>Id.</T3> at 156-57. Such express authorization would allow an insuredinstitution to invest in those securities without having to acquire theapproval of its Principal Supervisory Agent (``PSA''), assuming independentauthorization to make such an unapproved purchase.On April 12, 1989, the Board issued a reproposal treating investments inFannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock in a manner consistent with the savingsclause of the current equity-risk investment regulation, 12 CFR 563.9-8(f).<T3>See</T3> 54 FR at 15427 (April 18, 1989). Under this treatment, allinvestments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock_regardless of when purchased_wouldbe considered equity-risk investments, but the Board would ``grandfather''_ratherthan exclude_those investments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock madeon or before December 14, 1988 for purposes of applying the regulation.As such, an institution whose holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stockpushed the institution over its equity-risk investment threshold, as setat 12 CFR 563.9-8(c)(2), would not have to divest itself of such holdingssolely for that reason; nevertheless, the institution could not make anyadditional equity-risk investment without PSA approval or divestment. TheBoard believed that this grandfathering treatment was necessary becauseit continued to consider the risks inherent in investment in such stockequally concrete for stock purchased on or before December 14, 1988, asfor stock purchased afterward.For the reasons set forth in the preambles to the original proposal andthe reproposal, and those discussed in the following section, the Boardcontinues to believe that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock deserve inclusionas ``equity securities,'' and therefore, as equity-risk investments. <T3>See</T3> 54 FR at 15427-28; 54 FR at 156-57. The Board today is adoptingthe final regulation substantially in the form of the reproposal, witha modification in the treatment of previously held Fannie Mae and FreddieMac stock for purposes of the diversification requirement of the equity-riskinvestment regulation. The following section discusses the comments receivedon the reproposal and the Board's response.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Board Response</ITAG>The Board received three comment letters in response to the April reproposal.\1\<NOTE/> One of the comments was from an insured institution and twowere from trade associations.\2\<NOTE/> One of the comment letters supported the reproposal as drafted.This commenter reiterated its comment to the original proposal, statingthat there was no basic distinction between the risk inherent in publiclytraded Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock and ``the stock of other reputablecompanies traded on public exchanges.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\Two of those commenters had also commented on the Board'soriginal proposal.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\The Board received six comment letters in response to itsoriginal proposal. <T3>See</T3> 54 FR at 15427. Those comments were discussed in the preambleto the Board's reproposal. <T3>Id.</T3> Two commenters disputed the premise of both the original proposal and thereproposal by stating that the risk inherent in investments in Fannie Maeand Freddie Mac stock does not rise to the level of other equity-risk investments.One of these commenters maintained that the reproposal is ``unfair'' becauseit does not take into account the change in risk to an institution withthe passage of time, based on the ``changing relationship between carryingvalue and price.'' The commenter also contended that the recent upswingin values of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock indicate ``a high degreeof profitability and moderate market risk.'' The commenter argued thatsuch holdings were important to a balanced thrift portfolio and characterizedthem as having a ``counter-risk investment effect'' to fluctuations ininterest rates. That commenter also questioned whether the Board couldregulate retroactively to cover investments made on or after December 14,1988. It also argued that if the Board decides to go forward with its reproposal,the Board should also grandfather the covered investments in Fannie Maeand Freddie Mac stock with respect to the equity-risk investment diversificationrequirement, 12 CFR 563.9-8(e), in addition to the proposed grandfatheringof the rule's threshold requirements. The other opposing commenter reiteratedthe point it had raised in its comment on the original proposal that classificationof Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock as both equity-risk investments andcomponents of the Board's ``Qualified Thrift Lender'' (``QTL'') test wouldbe ``operational[ly] inconsistent.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Inclusion of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Stock as Equity-Risk Investments/GrandfatheringEquity-Risk Thresholds</ITAG>The Board is unpersuaded by the arguments that Fannie Mae and Freddie Macstock are inherently less risky than all other equity securities currentlyincluded as equity-risk investments. First, while the recent market performanceof Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock has been impressive and both entitieshave been managed effectively, this <T3>recent</T3> performance is by no means a guarantee of future marketperformance.\3\<NOTE/> Instead, it represents a period where the Standards andamp;Poors 500 index has itself shown a rapid rise.\4\<NOTE/> One commenter asserts, without supporting empirical data,that other equity-risk investments are ``much riskier'' than the stockat issue in today's rule. The commenter's case for excluding Fannie Maeand Freddie Mac stock from the ``equity security'' definition could bemade for many other equity securities using the same limited time frame.<T3>See</T3> nn. 3, 4, <T3>supra.</T3> A very different case could be made if a different, butsimilarly limited, time frame, including October, 1987, were selected.<T3>See also</T3> 54 FR 15427-28. In sum, there are no guarantees thatall equity securities, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock, willnot fluctuate considerably over time along with changes in the markets.The Board is, therefore, not dissuaded from its belief that Fannie Maeand Freddie Mac stock have characteristics that represent risks similarto those presented by other high-quality equity securities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\The Board similarly finds unpersuasive the argument raisedby one commenter that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock are critical toa well balanced portfolio because they demonstrated ``a counter-risk investmenteffect'' to changes in interest rates. The Board believes that while thelimited time frame chosen by the commenter for its analysis may lead tothis conclusion, a different scenario is certainly possible where an increasein interest rates may not coincide with an increase in the equity securitiesmarkets, as has occurred in the past.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\The period chosen by the commenter to demonstrate the stellarperformance in stock issued by Fannie Mae and the Student Loan MarketingAssociation (``Sallie Mae'') was from December 1987 until June 1989. OnDecember 1, 1987, the Sandamp;P 500 was at 232.00; on June 1, 1989, the indexstood at 321.97. Similarly, the Sandamp;P 500 has shown a marked rise sinceJanuary 1, 1989, the day Freddie Mac preferred stock became publicly traded.<ITAG tagnum="28">Conspicuously absent from the commenter's analysis is any discussionof the performance of Fannie Mae, or for that matter Sallie Mae, stockduring a downturn in the market in general. We believe that it is significantthat the commenter chose to begin its analysis in December 1987, the periodwhere the equity securities markets were just beginning to recover fromthe crash of October 19, 1987, popularly known as ``Black Monday''. A reviewof the week leading up to the October 19 downturn will demonstrate thatthe stocks at issue in today's final rule are, in fact, directly affectedby market conditions. Specifically, in that week, Fannie Mae common stockfell from a high of 41\1/2\ to a fifty-two week low of 29\1/2\. Later thatmonth the stock was trading as low as 27. Sallie Mae common stock lostover ten percent of its value on Black Monday alone.</ITAG>One commenter faults the Board for failure to take into account the changein the riskiness of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock based upon the changingrelationship between carrying value and price over time. While market-valueaccounting has merit, it is not appropriate to use that method in the contextof the equity-risk investment regulation for certain assets, such as thestock at issue today, but not for others. For the purposes of today's rule,the Board believes that the best course of action is to treat the equitysecurities at issue consistently with other equity-risk investments.\5\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\The commenter argues that the Board's position would ``prevent''an institution from swapping a greater than threshold amount of FreddieMac stock for an equal amount of Fannie Mae stock, thus ``freezing [the]institution into a larger (and more risky) than desired position in FreddieMac.'' Notwithstanding the commenter's inconsistent assertions that FreddieMac stock should not be classified as an equity-risk investment becauseit is not risky and that his insured institution should get out of itsadmittedly large position in such stock because it was ``unduly risky,''the Board is not persuaded by the commenter's point regarding a need forthe free ability to swap excess ``grandfathered'' Freddie Mac stock forFannie Mae stock. The stock of each organization has its own characteristicsand risks. Nevertheless, the commenter's institution is not prevented frommaking the swap; instead, it is free to do so with PSA approval, in compliancewith the equity-risk investment regulation. This commenter also contends that the Board should change the reproposalto grandfather all investments made as of the effective date of the regulatorychange, rather than as of December 14, 1988. Without this change, the commenterargues, the Board would be regulating retroactively. The Board remainsof the view expressed in its original proposal that it is imperative toeliminate any incentive for institutions to increase their equity-riskinvestments in anticipation of any final rule. The Board believes thisconcern still to be valid, and consequently has determined to retain theproposed grandfathering date of December 14, 1988. It notes that this isconsistent with the treatment of former additions to the list of equity-riskinvestments. <T3>See</T3> 12 CFR 563.9-8(f). Another commenter reiterated an assertion made in response to the Board'soriginal proposal that the Board's proposal to make Fannie Mae and FreddieMac stock equity-risk investments was inconsistent with the Board's previousruling that such investments satisfied an insured institution's QualifiedThrift Lender (``QTL'') requirements.\6\<NOTE/> The Board responded to this comment in the preamble to thereproposal and, upon review, adheres to its earlier analysis. <T3>See</T3> 54 FR at 15428. As discussed in that preamble, the Board believesthat the QTL and equity-risk investment tests were designed for differentpurposes and are not mutually exclusive, finding no support for the commenter'sassertion that ``Congress implied that the housing-related benefits ofowning these agency stocks outweighed any potential risks of such ownership.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\The key component of the QTL test, enacted in the CompetitiveEquality Banking Act of 1987 (``CEBA''), Pub. L. No. 100-86, 101 Stat.at 571-73, andSection;104(c)(1) (1987), was that insured institutions wererequired to hold at least 60 percent of their tangible assets in certain``qualified thrift investments'' in order to qualify for favorable QTLtreatment. <T3>See</T3> 53 FR 312 (Jan. 6, 1988). Stock issued by Fannie Mae and FreddieMac were among the investments approved by the Board as housing-relatedinvestments. <T3>Id.</T3> at 313, 322 (codified at 12 CFR 563.27(c)(6) (1988)). <ITAG tagnum="84">Grandfathering Equity-Risk Investment Rule Diversification Requirement</ITAG>In addition to any other limitation placed on an insured institution'sequity-risk investments by the threshold provision at 12 CFR 563.9-8(c)(2),the equity-risk investment regulation also contains a diversification limitationon the purchase of equity securities. <T3>See</T3> 12 CFR 563.9-8(e)(1). Specifically, that provision statesthat except as otherwise provided, ``no insured institution shall at anytime own, control, or hold with power to vote for its own account morethan 25 percent of any one class of the outstanding equity securities ofany one issuer nor an amount of all classes of the outstanding equity anddebt securities of such issuer which, when aggregated with loans to suchissuer, are greater than the institution's `regulatory capital' * * * .''<T3>Id.</T3> One commenter contends that failure to grandfather the foregoing provisionas part of today's rule could effectively nullify the Board's action ofgrandfathering Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock for purposes of the equity-riskinvestment threshold. The commenter further states that failure to grandfatherFannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock holdings for purposes of diversificationwould be especially troubling because the diversification provision containsa limitation on an insured institution's holdings of the ``equity <T3>and debt</T3> securities'' of the issuing instrumentality. Upon review,the Board believes that these contentions have merit. Thus, the final regulationincludes an express grandfathering of such investments from the requirementsof subsection (e)(1). The Board did not intend to create a back-door limitationon stock holdings otherwise properly grandfathered. Many insured institutionshave substantial holdings in relatively risk-free Fannie Mae and FreddieMac debt securities. Upon reconsideration, the Board believes no usefulpurpose would be served by, in effect, penalizing such institutions forholding debt instruments not otherwise within the realm of concern of theequity-risk investment regulation. While today's final rule covers onlythose two U.S. government-sponsored instrumentalities, the Board may revisitthe issue with respect to all privately issued debt securities at a laterdate. <ITAG tagnum="85">Equity Securities of U.S. Government-Sponsored Corporations as Pre-AuthorizedEquity-Risk Investments </ITAG>Commenters on the reproposal did not address the addition of Fannie Maeand Freddie Mac stock to the list of permissible equity security investmentsfor equity-risk purposes, pursuant to 12 CFR 563.9-8(d)(1).\7\<NOTE/> This section does not, in and of itself, provide the authorityfor an insured institution to invest in the listed equity securities. Itmerely provides that when such investments are otherwise within the institution'sauthority, supervisory preapproval of such investments for purposes ofthe equity-risk investment regulation is not required. Fannie Mae and FreddieMac stock are expressly authorized investments for Federal associationspursuant to section 5(c)(1)(F) of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933, 12U.S.C. 1464(c)(1)(F) (1982). As discussed above, investment in such securitiesappears no more or less risky than the other investments currently authorizedas equity-risk investments in 12 CFR 563.9-8(d). Moreover, the Board hasseen no data that indicates that the stock of any United States governmentsponsored corporation should not be such a preapproved investment.\8\<NOTE/> Therefore, investments in equity securities issued by allUnited States government-sponsored corporations, including Class A commonstock recently issued by the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation(``Farmer Mac'') have been added to the list of permissible investments.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ This provision of the regulation provides that an insuredinstitution could invest in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock up to otherwiseauthorized thresholds, without having to acquire the approval of the institution'sPSA. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Stock issued by the Student Loan Marketing Associationis already included on that list. <ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Date of the Final Rule </ITAG>Although today's final regulation will not be administered until the ``effectivedate'' listed above, the regulation should be considered ``in effect''as of the date of publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> for the purpose of transferring the regulatorychanges made in this rule to any successor agency, following enactmentof the banking legislation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>Pursuant to section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 604,the Board is providing the following regulatory flexibility analysis. 1. <T3>Reasons, objections and legal basis underlying the final rule. </T3>Theseelements are incorporated above in the <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION </T2> regarding the reproposal. 2. <T3>Small entities to which the final rule would apply. </T3>The finalrule would apply to all insured institutions. 3. <T3>Impact of the final rule on small entities. </T3>The Small BusinessAdministration defines a small financial institution as ``a commercialbank or savings and loan association, the assets of which, for the precedingfiscal year, do not exceed $100 million.'' 13 CFR 121.13(a).
