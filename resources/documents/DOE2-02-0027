Considering the relationof the multiplicity distribution to the density matrix for Boson systems,we re-introduce the partially coherent laser distribution, which allowsfor coherent as well as incoherent hadronic emission from the k fundamentalcells, and provides equally good phenomenological fits to existing data.The broadening of non-single diffractive hadron-hadron distributionscan be equally well due to the decrease of coherent with increasing energyas to the large (and rapidly decreasing) values of k deduced from negativebinomial fits. Similarly the narrowness of e/sup +/-e/sup -/ multiplicitydistribution is due to nearly coherent (therefore nearly Poissonian)emission from a small number of jets, in contrast to the negative binomialwith enormous values of k. 31 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
