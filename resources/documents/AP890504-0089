(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge today refused to prohibitthe Lac du Flambeau band of Chippewa Indians from spearing all ofits allowable fish catch on some northern Wisconsin lakes.   U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb said she would hear furtherarguments from the state on the issue. And she said she would heararguments Friday on Gov. Tommy G. Thompson's request that she stopall Chippewa Indian spearfishing by Saturday.   An agreement to cut the fish take was reached at a meeting morethan two weeks ago between Thompson and leaders of the six Chippewabands. But after increasing harassment of spearfishing Indians bysport fishermen, the tribal chief said Tuesday that the band mightbegin taking 100 percent of the fish that biologists consider safeto take from a lake.   The Thursday hearing was a telephone conference hookup among thestate attorney general, the judge and a lawyer representing theIndians.   Assistant State Attorney General Stephen Nicks told the judgethe prohibition order on Lac du Flambeau spearing was necessary toprotect the fish. He said if the band carried out its threat toincrease the take of walleye, it would complicate state efforts toset limits for the hook-and-line season for the general publicopening Saturday.   Crabb said the Chippewa appeared to be ``giving up something towhich they were already entitled'' in the agreement with Thompson.She said she wondered why the Lac du Flambeau would want to ``stepaside'' from a right they have had for more than 100 years under19th century treaties.   Tribal chairman Michael G. Allen Sr. warned the state Tuesdaythat the band could retaliate against future violentanti-spearfishing protests by taking 100 percent of the safe catchfrom any lakes where incidents take place.   Nine arrests were reported Wednesday night, including two at BigArbor Vitae Lake where about 300 people gathered on land and about30 boats congregated on the lake to protest the off-reservationspearing.   More than 100 arrests have been made since the spearing seasonbegan April 23. This is the fifth year Wisconsin's six Chippewatribes have speared fish off reservation since a federal courtruled the tribe retained the right to hunt, fish, trap and gatherwild grain under 19th century treaties that ceded land to theUnited States.   Unlike in previous springs, this year has no specific date forthe end of the season. The fish are most easily speared duringspring, when they spawn is shallow waters.</TEXT></DOC>
