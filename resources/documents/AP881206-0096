The Federal Tribunal, the nation's supreme court, lifted strictbanking secrecy rules in rejecting Yakov Nimrodi's appeal of adecision by Swiss police to grant legal assistance in theinvestigation.   Nimrodi, an Israeli businessman, told the court his account atthe Geneva branch of Credit Suisse Bank was used to channel $1million in Israeli funds to an account controlled by former WhiteHouse aide Oliver North. The Swiss account was code-named``Trans-Eagle.''   One of the judges, who cannot be identified under court practice,said the money apparently came from arms shipments. He did notelaborate.   Nimrodi said he was acting on a secret mission for the Israeligovernment. The court rejected his arguments that as middleman hewas an uninvolved third party and should be granted immunity.   In August of last year, the Federal Tribunal ordered secrecylifted on accounts at Credit Suisse linked to other figures involvedin U.S. arms sales to Iran and diversion of the funds to Contrarebels in Nicaragua.   Those figures were Richard Secord, a retired U.S. Air Forcegeneral; his associate, Iranian-born businessman Albert Hakim; andIranian arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar.
