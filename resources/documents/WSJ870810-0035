The settlement, reached last Wednesday and set to take effect Oct. 1, includes a formula intended to eliminate subsidies on half the European pasta exported to the U.S. and reduce subsidies on the remaining half, initially by 27.5%. The U.S. says it intends to press for further cuts in subsidies.    The agreement, reached after marathon U.S.-EC talks, put to rest at least temporarily a seven-month dispute on subsidies for pasta exports to the U.S. and may have averted a trade war. </TEXT></DOC>
