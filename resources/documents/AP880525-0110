Jesse Helms, R-N.C., as he sat down at a meeting with Senateleaders to work out a procedural tangle that has stalled action onthe treaty for more than a week.   The move raised hopes among treaty supporters that the pactcould be approved for ratification as soon as Friday, and forwardedto Reagan by the time the summit begins on Sunday to give him astronger position in the talks with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., and his Republicancounterpart, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, had filed petitions Tuesdayto limit debate and force it to a vote in time for the summit.   ``I'm fairly confident we will be able to finish the treatyFriday or Saturday,'' Byrd said. But he noted that potentialproblems still exist, including competing items on the Senate'slegislative agenda, such as attempting to override PresidentReagan's veto of a trade bill.   Reagan left Washington today for the summit, with a three-daystopover in Helsinki, Finland, en route.   The president was looking ahead to the next arms-control treaty,one he hopes will call for massive reductions in U.S. and Sovietarsenals of intercontinental nuclear missiles. He said he hopedsuch a pact could be reached before his term expires in January.   ``It is the requirements of a good treaty, and not somearbitrary deadline, that will determine the timetable,'' Reagansaid in remarks broadcast on the government's ``Worldnet''satellite service.   The treaty, which requires elimination within three years of allU.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3,400miles, requires 67 votes for Senate approval. Estimates of Senatesupport for the measure range from 87 to 95 votes, so its ultimateoutcome is not in question.   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, as it is known,would result in the elimination of 867 U.S. missiles in Europe, andelimination of 1,752 Soviet missiles.   But Helms and a few other conservatives have sought to delay themeasure, raising questions about the validity of intelligence dataon the numbers of some Soviet missiles and the crafting of thetreaty language. They have offered a series of amendments since thetreaty was brought up last week, all of which have been defeated byoverwhelming margins.   ``Both sides fouled up on this treaty,'' Helms said duringTuesday's debate. ``My conscience will not allow me not to pursuethe obvious defects.''   But Byrd and Dole filed motions Tuesday to limit the debate, anda vote on that matter was scheduled for sometime Thursday. It wasconsidered virtually certain to win the 60 votes needed to cut offdebate, and that would set up a vote on final approval of thetreaty for sometime Friday.   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., a treaty supporter, said he believedopponents were not attacking the intermediate-range missile treatybut were instead trying to sow doubt about a future treaty cuttinglong-range missile arsenals.   ``It seems to me like nuclear idolatry,'' Bumpers said. ``Theideologues will never, never go gently into that night.''   Byrd said he was confident Democrats would still be able tobring up and debate the one amendment adopted during committeeconsideration of the treaty, one that would force the president toget Senate approval for any later change in interpretation of thetreaty.   The amendment is an attempt to assert the Senate'sconstitutional right of advise and consent on the president'streaty-making power, and stems from a dispute over Reaganadministration reinterpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missiletreaty with the Soviets.   Byrd said today he had prepared a possible compromise on theamendment, which was put forward by Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., butdeclined to discuss it.</TEXT></DOC>
