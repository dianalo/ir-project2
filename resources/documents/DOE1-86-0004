The fast wave can driveRF current with the drive efficiency of eta/sub CD/ = n-bar/sub e/(10/sup19/ m/sup -3/)I/sub RC/(A)R(m)/P/sub RF/(W) {similar_to} 3.0 when thewave frequency is selected to be f/f/sub ci/ andgt; 7. A sharp wave spectrumand a andless;{upsilon}/sub ph{vert_bar}{vert_bar}/andgt;/{upsilon}/sub Te/ {similar_to}3.0 are required to obtain a good efficiency. A center peaked RF currentprofile can be formed with an appropriate wave spectrum even in the hightemperature plasma.</TEXT></DOC>
