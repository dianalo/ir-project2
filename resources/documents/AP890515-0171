The study was conducted by DRI McGraw Hill Energy Group ofLexington and Atmospheric and Environmental Research Inc. ofCambridge.   Using computer models, researchers concluded that global warmingwould raise average annual temperatures nationwide two degrees by2010, and the drain on power would require the building of 86 newmidsize power plants nationwide.   That would result in about a 4 percent increase in electricitycosts, the study found.   Global warming, also known as the greenhouse effect, is causedby solar heat trapped under gases in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxideand other pollutants associated with burning fossil fuels areconsidered chief causes.   The study looked only at carbon dioxide as a factor, butscientists have pointed to many others, including chemicals used inair conditioners.   Some scientists say global warming could raise temperatures fourto nine degrees by 2050 and melt polar ice caps and cause sealevels to rise, causing severe droughts and storms and disruptingthe Earth's biological systems.   The study, which will be presented Thursday at the EdisonElectric Institute in Seattle, bolsters arguments that ignoringglobal warming could be expensive.   ``We didn't know whether or not the kind of changes that theseatmospheric scientists were talking about really would make much ofa difference,'' said Larry Makovich, a study author. ``It does, Ithink, put some hard numbers to it.''   Researchers found that higher temperatures bring lower heatingneeds in the winter, but power plants are built to handle peakdemand, and exceptionally hot summers would drive the peaksignificantly beyond current levels, Makovich said.   The predicted need for new plants poses a dilemma for utilities,said George Loehr, acting executive director of the Northeast PowerCoordinating Council.   Building conventional plants means stoking the ``greenhouse''gases, while nuclear power plants are becoming increasinglyunpopular, he said.   That leaves conservation as the most attractive option, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
