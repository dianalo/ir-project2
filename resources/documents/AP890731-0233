First Bank of Chicago was the first to take the step shortlybefore the opening of the stock market, with Chemical Bank,Continenal Bank, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., Manufacturers HanoverTrust Co., Bankers Trust Co. and No. 1 Citibank joining in.   The reduction, effective immediately, follows similar cuts bySan Francisco-based Bank of America on Friday and Chase ManhattanBank more than three weeks ago. A few other smaller banks havereduced their prime rates since Chase's move.   The prime rate reflects a bank's costs of borrowing money,including interest it pays on savings accounts or certificates ofdeposit, and trails more subtle increases in other interest rates.   The rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a basisfor calculating loans to businesses and for determining many typesof fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans. Mortgage rates are notincluded in that category.   Today's decrease was widely expected by most economists due tocontinuing signs that the Federal Reserve is seeking looser creditpolicies in response to a slowdown in economic growth.   Economists have speculated that major banks did not immediatelyfollow Chase, which cut its prime rate on July 10, partly becausethey wanted to determine whether the Fed would keep pursuing lowerinterest rates.   ``The sentiment in the marketplace was that Chase was too earlyand everyone else was waiting until the federal funds rate stayedbelow 9 percent,'' said Elizabeth G. Reiners, an economist withDean Wittter Reynolds Inc.   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans betweenbanks, traded at 8~ percent by late morning today, down from 815-16 percent Friday. The Fed controls the rate by adding orsubtracting banking reserves.   Other interest rates in the credit markets have been fallingsteadily. The yield on the widely watched 30-year Treasury bondfinished below 8 percent Friday for the first time since Spring1987, closing at 7.985. It traded lower at 7.95 percent by latemorning today as bond prices rose.   Stock prices, however, were down slightly in late-morningtrading.   The prime stood at 10.5 percent at the start of 1989. It wasraised twice in February to 11.5 percent, then lowered a halfpercentage point on June 5. Those movements reflected changingconcerns about economic growth and inflation.</TEXT></DOC>
