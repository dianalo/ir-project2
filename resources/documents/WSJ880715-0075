But when they tried out the code on employees in focus groups, the managers got a rude shock. Point by point, the employees disputed the code's precepts. Security Pacific believes in open communication, the code said. Wrong, said employees: Management is reluctant to be honest. The company provides equal opportunity for everyone, was another point. Wrong again: Opportunities are manipulated and blocked by higher-ups, employees said. The company assesses the moral fitness of clients before we do business with them, management maintained. No, said employees: We take business where we can get it.    The managers considered abandoning the idea of a code, says Mr. Margol. Instead, they started a program to close &quot;the myth and reality gap&quot; by convincing employees that the code was serious and encouraging workers to abide by it.    Formal ethics codes are hot these days. Companies without them are scrambling to commit corporate values to paper. Companies that already have codes are rushing to update, disseminate and interpret them. Consultants are flocking to help with the task; conferences and seminars abound.    &quot;The interest today is greater than it's ever been,&quot; says Alexander Horniman, a senior fellow at the Olsson Center for Applied Ethics at the Darden School of the University of Virginia.    But difficulties -- and skeptics -- abound. Some employees resist codes. They feel pressured to go along, and resent having their own values questioned. And ethics specialists say some codes are mere window dressing: They look good but aren't expected to interfere with the realities of the business world.    Ethics codes generally address such topics as conflict of interest, confidentiality of corporate information, misappropriation of corporate assets, bribes and kickbacks, and political contributions. Many begin with a statement of corporate mission. Some also contain sections on a corporation's responsibilities to its different constituencies, including customers, employees and shareholders.    Well-publicized cases of corporate malfeasance fuel interest in ethics codes. Many corporate codes date from the 1970s, when big foreign-bribery scandals were uncovered. Nowadays, corporate officers are looking at insider-trading convictions and government contracting scandals.    Some backers say ethics codes are particularly important these days to spell out corporate positions on difficult issues such as employee testing and privacy, insider trading and industrial espionage. At the same time, companies face growing scrutiny as the public and legislators become more concerned about business conduct.    &quot;This generation of managers will be judged in large measure according to its ability to make sound ethical choices,&quot; and not just for its bottom-line results, Ronald Berenbein, senior Conference Board research associate, told a recent conference on ethics sponsored by the group.    Proponents of ethics codes also say they can help companies go through mergers, acquisitions and restructuring. &quot;No unit we owned in 1977 is part of the company today,&quot; says Robert J. Bell, who helped Primerica Corp. develop a new ethics code before he recently retired as vice president and general auditor. The company's transformation from a packaging company to one engaged in financial services, specialty retailing and other fields stirred fears that employees in newly acquired units would unwittingly violate its policies on employee conduct.    So, from 1980 to 1985, Primerica put together an ethics code, expanding on existing elements, and began giving workshops to immerse new employees in the code and the corporate culture. For example, the company discussed with managers a hypothetical case study of a specialty retailing unit. Although paying retailers to buy goods is common in that field, Primerica made it clear that such practices would violate its ethics code's prohibition of payments and other inducements to make a sale, and wouldn't be tolerated.    When a company opts for a code, often the first difficulty is deciding how detailed to make it. Susan Spagnola, vice president and senior counsel of Chemical Banking Corp., says the company prefers a lengthy code because banking raises many legal and regulatory issues -- which the bank feels are also ethical questions -- that apply to all employees.    As in other companies with simpler plans, the bank also has separate policies on employee behavior in specific departments. But items in the ethics code &quot;might be something all (employees) would encounter,&quot; Ms. Spagnola says. She cites a provision on gifts that is derived from the Federal Bank Bribery Act, which makes it illegal for bank employees to give or receive gifts with the intent of influencing or being influenced.    Other companies take a minimalist approach. Levi Strauss andamp; Co. moved from a 13-page booklet &quot;filled with details and procedures&quot; to a half-page statement of principles, says a spokeswoman. Among other items, the new code affirms the company's &quot;respect for customers and employees,&quot; and it exhorts employees to avoid &quot;real or perceived conflicts of interest.&quot;    Levi Strauss made the change to reflect its confidence in its employees' own sense of right and wrong, the spokeswoman says. And when employees can't figure out what to do, she adds, the company would prefer to have them turn to their manager or supervisor for guidance or support, rather than to a detailed document.    For similar reasons, some companies decide to do without a code altogether. After taking a close look at other companies' ethics codes, Mead Corp. decided that ethical conduct &quot;can't be reduced to a code,&quot; says Thomas H. Schumann, human resources vice president at the company's fine-paper division. &quot;You can't cover everything, and people think if it's not covered, it's OK.&quot;    Some companies, fearing legal repercussions, go out of their way to make sure the parties mentioned in ethics codes don't mistake them for legally binding documents. The Security Pacific code, for example, promises employees timely performance reviews -- but also makes it clear that such a vow is a goal, not formal policy. Otherwise, &quot;you could be open to legal suits,&quot; says Mr. Margol. A fired employee, for instance, could sue on the ground that he or she hadn't had a performance review in a long time.    Still, whether detailed or general, ethics codes often come under attack for the same reason: Much of what is contained in the codes, ethics specialists say, doesn't really address ethics in general, but rather is intended to protect the corporation. A Washington State University study of ethics codes at 202 Fortune 500 companies found that while 75% fail to address the company's role in civic and community affairs, consumer relations, environmental safety and product safety, more than 75% deal with conflicts of interest -- which can affect the bottom line.    Kirk O. Hanson, a lecturer at Stanford University's business school and a consultant in business ethics, says most ethics codes &quot;are compliance documents reflecting legal standards the company wishes employees to observe&quot; on &quot;negative and punitive&quot; topics, including conflict of interest and insider trading.    Another criticism is that codes often put too much of the burden to be ethical on employees, while not addressing ways in which companies can create an atmosphere that facilitates ethical behavior by employees. For instance, a code could instruct managers not to put undue pressure on subordinates to accomplish goals. Without such provisions, &quot;the message is, 'You people should behave ethically regardless of what else is going on in the company,'&quot; says Barbara Ley Toffler, a partner in Resources for Responsible Management, a Boston-based consulting group that deals with corporate ethics. &quot;It's focusing on people and not on the environment.&quot;    Indeed, codes sometimes run directly counter to actions that employees are all but forced to take. This can create strain -- and resentment -- in the workers.    For example, U.S. companies are banned by law from paying bribes overseas. But doing business abroad without such payments is often difficult, so many companies make such payments -- on the books and thus legally -- under different names, such as &quot;facilitating payments.&quot; Employees often feel the payments, though legal, violate the spirit of corporate ethics codes.    At one big telecommunications company, Ms. Toffler found the issue of such payments caused &quot;tremendous pain&quot; among the affected managers. &quot;This was a company with a reputation for responsible and ethical behavior. They felt the company was doing a number on them, and they were doing the company's dirty work.&quot;    A study of Champion International Corp.'s ethics code by the Business Roundtable, a group of senior business leaders, found that the lower the level of employees, the greater was their cynicism and hostility toward ethics codes. The phrase &quot;the Champion way&quot; is meant to indicate high business standards and fair treatment of employees. But researchers found that at a mill in Maine, &quot;'That's the Champion way' was often applied derisively to management actions with which employees disagree.&quot;    A Champion spokeswoman acknowledges that such skepticism exists there. But she notes that employees at the mill have been influenced by their turbulent recent past, which included a hostile takeover battle with another company before the mill was acquired by Champion in a friendly merger.    ---          Setting the Standards -- and Enforcing Them   In a survey of companies with ethics codes, these percentages said the following people participated in drafting the document: Top management ..................................... 80% Legal department ................................... 44% Directors .......................................... 24% Founder or member of founder's family .............. 7.1% Consultants ........................................ 2.2%   These percentages of surveyed companies said their ethics codes include the following penalties for violations: Termination ........................................ 52% Suspension ......................................... 30% Probation .......................................... 21% Demotion ........................................... 19% Appraisal comments ................................. 14% - Other .............................................. 11%   Note: Both charts include multiple responses   Source: The Conference Board</TEXT></DOC>
