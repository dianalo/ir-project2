They weremeasured for UCu{sub 5} and U{sub 2}Zn/sub 17/ via the quasielastic linesby inelastic neutron scattering. Both compounds behave very similarly.We observe a common broad Lorentzian quasielastic line with width oforder {Gamma}sub QE/{approx_equal}0 meV, virtually unaffected by themagnetic phase transition, but also a narrow Gaussian quasielastic line,which we attribute to critical spin fluctuations. We discuss the occurrenceof magnetic order in spite of the fast valence-fluctuation rate as incontrast to similar magnetically ordering 4f systems.</TEXT></DOC>
