HIDLAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two common antibiotics used against traveler'sdiarrhea helped a group of AIDS patients live longer by preventingthe pneumonia that is a leading cause of death from the disease, astudy found.   The drug therapy gives doctors an important new weapon in thefight against AIDS, a fatal, incurable immune disorder, one of thestudy's authors said Thursday.   ``If we intercede early with medications that may preventlife-threatening infections, that will prolong life and improve thequality of life,'' said Dr. Margaret Fischl, lead researcher on thestudy published in Friday's Journal of the American MedicalAssociation.   The two antibiotics, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole,prevented 30 patients with early stages of AIDS from developingpneumocystis carinii pneumonia while they remained on the drugs   The patients also lived much longer than 30 similar patients whodid not receive the drugs, said Ms. Fischl, an associate medicalprofessor and director of AIDS research at the University of MiamiSchool of Medicine.   The patients each had been newly diagnosed as having Kaposi'ssarcoma, a skin cancer that afflicts AIDS patients. But they hadn'tdeveloped pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or any of the otheropportunistic infections that eventually kill AIDS victims, thestudy said.   ``More than 50 percent of patients with AIDS developpneumocystis carinii infection and, despite therapy, more than 20percent die with overwhelming infection,'' the study noted.   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys thebody's defenses against disease, leaving its victims prey toinfections and certain cancers.   The patients were studied between January 1984 and June 1985,and were re-examined in June 1987.   Sixteen of the 30 patients who didn't receive the antibioticsdeveloped the pneumonia, the study results showed.   None of the 30 patients taking the antibiotics developed thepneumonia while they received the drugs, the study said.   But half of those receiving the drugs had side effects such asnausea and skin rashes, the study said. Five had such severereactions they had to stop taking the antibiotics, it said. Four ofthe five developed the pneumonia within four or five months afterthe treatment was halted.   During the study, 28 of the 30 patients _ 93 percent _ notreceiving the antibiotics died, compared with 18 patients, or 60percent, in the group that took the drugs.   Ms. Fischl estimated that 40 percent of the patients who tookthe drugs remain alive today. Only one patient who wasn't given thedrugs is still living, she said by telephone from her Miami office.   A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1982found that the same two prescription antibiotics were effective inquickly relieving the misery of travelers' diarrhea, a disordercommon to visitors of Latin America, the Middle East, the Far Eastand the Mediterranean.   Ms. Fischl recommended Thursday that all patients with AIDS andAIDS-related illness, a condition called ARC, be considered fortherapy with the two antibotics.   Similar tests are being conducted on other antibiotics to see ifthey also may be effective in preventing AIDS-related infections,she said.   Ms. Fischl speculated that the medical technique known aschemoprophylaxis _ trying to prevent infections with low doses ofantibotics _ may become a major weapon against AIDS and be used inconjunction with other drugs, such as AZT.   AZT, or azidothymidine, has been shown to prolong the lives ofAIDS patients by reducing the frequency and severity ofopportunistic infections, like the rare pneumonia.   ``Perhaps the combination of chemoprophylaxis with AZT willimprove the outcome better than either alone,'' said Ms. Fischl,who also has directed studies of AZT.   The virus that causes AIDS is believed to be passed mainlythrough sexual intercourse, shared hypodermic needles and frominfected mothers to their infants before or during birth.</TEXT></DOC>
