Much of thework involves the manipulation of this gene family in primary cell culturesin which the full physiological process can be reversibly reproduced.It also describes how heat shock and cellular stress produced in settingup cell cultures can modify the action of estrogen. Finally, some recentresults obtained in their laboratory on specific switching on in vitroof the silent vitellogenin genes in nuclei isolated from male Xenopushepatocytes by soluble extracts are also described. In addition, it isintended to point out those areas of possible fruitful investigationin the future that are likely to further our understanding of the differentelements that determine hormonal regulation of gene expression.</TEXT></DOC>
