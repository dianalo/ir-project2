This notice discusses the proposed revisions and EPA's rationalefor proposing to approve them. The notice is divided into four separatesections for clarify. Section I discusses the revisions to Maine's newsource review (NSR) regulations including the State's regulations for theprevention of significant deterioration (PSD). Section II discusses therevisions to Maine's stack height regulations. Section III discusses Maine'svisibility protection requirements for class I areas. Section IV discussesrevisions to Maine's regulations which incorporate certain requirementsfor PM<T2>10</T2>. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. New Source Review Revisions </ITAG>A. Background In 1979, the Maine DEP adopted NSR regulations (including those for PSD)to satisfy the requirements for SIPs codified at 40 CFR Part 51. EPA approvedthese regulations and incorporated them into the SIP on January 30, 1980and February 19, 1980. On August 7, 1980 EPA promulgated major revisionsto 40 CFR Part 51's NSR/PSD requirements for SIPs pursuant to a court decision.(<T3>Alabama Power Company et al., </T3>v. <T3>Costle, </T3>D.C. Cir. No. 78-1006 December 14, 1979.) In addition,on October 14, 1981, EPA promulgated a change in the definition of theterm ``stationary source'' in the Part 51 regulations for nonattainmentareas. The Maine DEP has adopted revisions to its SIP's NSR/PSD regulationsto be consistent with the current NSR/PSD requirements codified at 40 CFR51.160 through 51.166. B. Summary of Maine's Submittal On August 22, 1988, the Maine DEP submitted these amended regulations toEPA as revisions to its SIP. The revisions include changes to Chapter 100,``Definitions,'' Chapter 110, ``Ambient Air Quality Standards,'' Chapter113, ``Growth Offset Regulations,'' Chapter 114, ``Classification of AirQuality Control Regions,'' Chapter 115 (formerly Chapter 108), ``EmissionLicense Regulations,'' and portions of Chapter 1, ``Regulations for theProcessing of Applications.'' These revisions also include a letter from the Maine DEP that certifiesthat the Maine DEP is implementing the ``Top Down'' approach in determiningBest Available Control Technology (BACT) in accordance with EPA's December1987 memorandum from Craig Potter entitled, ``Improving New Source ReviewImplementation'' and in accordance with the BACT document issued by theNortheast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM) dated October,1988. In addition, the Maine DEP committed to using the ``Top Down'' approachin all future BACT determinations. EPA has evaluated these proposed revisions and found that they are equivalentto, or in some instances, more stringent than, the requirements in 40 CFR51.160 through 51.166. Maine's regulations for NSR/PSD, and EPA's evaluation are detailed in amemorandum dated March 10, 1988 entitled, ``Technical Support Document_MaineNew Source Review Revisions.'' Copies of that document are available, uponrequest, from the EPA Regional Office listed in the ADDRESSES section ofthis notice. C. Amendments to Maine's NSR/PSD Regulations Necessary for Final ApprovalChapter 100 of Maine's regulations define ``major source'' as any sourcewhich emits or has the potential to emit any regulated pollutant greaterthan the significance levels found at 40 CFR 51.166(b)(23)(i). In generalthis means that Maine's definition is more stringent than the definitionof ``major stationary source'' in 40 CFR 51.165 and 51.166. However, Maine'sdefinition is not as stringent for new stationary sources in all cases.Maine's definition of ``major source'' does not include the portion ofthe federal definition which states that a major stationary source is alsoany physical change at a stationary source, not otherwise qualifying underthe definition of major stationary source, if the change would constitutea major stationary source by itself. Therefore, prior to final rulemaking,Maine must include the provisions of 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(iv)(A)(2) and40 CFR 51.166(b)(1)(i)(c) in its definition of ``major source.''Chapter 100 of Maine's regulations does not include a definition of theterm, ``Begin Actual Construction.'' Prior to final rulemaking, Maine mustinclude the definition of this term found at 40 CFR 51.166(b)(11). Maine submitted portions of Chapter 1 of its regulations for incorporationinto the SIP. However, the version of Chapter 1 submitted by the MaineDEP for approval and incorporation into the SIP is numbered and formatteddifferently from the version of Chapter 1 adopted and effective on theState level. The numbering and format of the version of Chapter 1 submittedto EPA should match the numbering of current State version of the regulation.Prior to final rulemaking, the Maine DEP must resubmit Chapter 1 in itsState-adopted form with the appropriate numbers and references. D. Today's Action <ITAG tagnum="81">Proposed Action </ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve Maine's request to revise the following SIPregulations: Chapter 100, ``Definitions,'' Chapter 110, ``Ambient Air QualityStandards,'' Chapter 113, ``Growth Offset Regulations,'' Chapter 114, ``Classificationof Air Quality Control Regions,'' Chapter 115 (formerly Chapter 108), ``EmissionLicense Regulations,'' and Chapter 1, ``Regulations for the Processingof Applications.'' These revisions incorporte the current federal new sourcereview and prevention of significant deterioration requirements of 40 CFR51.160 through 51.166. EPA is proposing approval with the understandingthat the Maine DEP will revise the regulations as outlined in this noticeprior to final EPA approval of these revisions. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Stack Height Revisions </ITAG>A. Background On February 8, 1982 (47 FR 5864), EPA promulgated final regulations limitingstack height credits and other dispersion techniques as required by section123 of the Act. These regulations were challenged in the U.S. Court ofAppeals for the D.C. Circuit by the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, Inc.,the Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvaniain <T3>Sierra Club </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>710 F.2d 436 (D.C. Cir. 1983). On October 11, 1983, the courtissued its decision ordering EPA to reconsider portions of the stack heightregulations, reversing certain portions and upholding other portions. On February 28, 1984, the electric power industry filed a petition fora writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. On July 2, 1984, theSupreme Court denied the petition, 104 S.Ct. 3571 (1984), and on July 18,1984, the Court of Appeals' mandate was formally issued, implementing thecourt's decision and requiring EPA to promulgate revisions to the stackheight regulations within six months. The promulgation deadline was ultimatelyextended to June 27, 1985. Revisions to the stack height regulations wereproposed on November 9, 1984 (49 FR 44878) and finalized on July 8, 1985(50 FR 27892). The revisions redefine a number of specific terms including ``excessiveconcentrations,'' ``dispersion techniques,'' ``nearby,'' and other importantconcepts, and modified some of the bases for determining good engineeringpractice (GEP) stack height. Pursuant to section 406(d)(2)(B) of the Act, all states were required to(1) review and revise, as necessary, their SIPs to include provisions thatlimit stack height credits and dispersion techniques in accordance withthe revised regulations; and (2) review all existing emission limitationsto determine whether any of these limitations have been effected by stackheight credits above GEP or any other dispersion techniques. For any limitationsso effected, states were to prepare revised limitations consistent withtheir revised SIPs. All SIP revisions and revised emission limits wereto be submitted to EPA, as required by section 406. Subsequently, EPA issueddetailed guidance on the performance of the required reviews. On January 22, 1988, the U.S. Court of Appeals issued a decision in <T3>NRDC </T3>v. <T3>Thomas, </T3>838 F.2d 1224 (D.C. Cir. 1988), regarding EPA's revisedJuly 8, 1985 stack height regulations. Subsequent petitions for reheaingwere denied. The Court remanded three provisions to EPA that may potentiallybear on state actions now being taken pursuant to EPA's July 8, 1985 regulations.However, since EPA is currently in the process of reconsidering the remandedprovisions and the outcome is as yet unknown, our review of Maine's August22, 1988 submittal addresses its consistency with the July 8, 1985 regulationsonly. If EPA further revises its regulations in response to the remandat some future date, Maine will, at that time, be required to revise itsregulations accordingly. Sources may have to have their permits amendedand/or be required to submit new demonstrations that applicable ambientstandards are met if affected by such revisions. B. Summary of Maine's Submittal Maine's August 22, 1988 SIP submittal includes revised regulations at Chapter116 which limit stack height credits and dispersion techniques in accordancewith the current requirements of 40 CFR 51.100 and 51.118. Additionally,Maine's revisions to Chapter 116 define the term ``ambient air.'' A separateSIP revision submittal, received by EPA on September 30, 1988, containsthe Maine DEP's review of all existing emission limitations. EPA has approvedthat SIP revision in a separate rulemaking notice published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on February 27, 1989 (54 FR 8190).Chapter 116 of Maine's Air Regulations, ``Prohibited Dispersion Techniques,''specifies the stack height and dispersion techniques requirements for thepermitting of air emission sources within the State of Maine. Additionally,Chapter 116 sets forth the locations where applicants must demonstratethat ambient air quality standards will be met (i.e., locations which constitute``ambient air'').With one significant exception, Maine's stack height and dispersion techniquesregulations at Chapter 116(II)(A) through (E) adequately parallel and areas stringent as those of 40 CFR 51.100 as amended on July 8, 1985. Mainehas adopted the language from 40 CFR Part 51's stack height regulationsvirtually verbatim except in one case.The one significant exception appears at Chapter 116(II)(E)(2) in the definitionof ``excessive concentration.'' For sources seeking credit for increasesin existing stack height up to formula height after October 11, 1983, Mainecorrectly sets forth the requirement that a maximum ground-level concentrationbe individually ``*** at least 40% in excess of the maximum concentrationexperienced in the absence of such downwash, wakes, or eddy effects ***.''However, Maine's regulation omits the essential provisions from 40 CFR51.100(kk)(2) that refer to pertinent language at (kk)(1), ``*** <T3>and </T3>which contributes to a total concentration due to emissionsfrom all sources that is greater than an ambient air standard *** [or]a prevention of significant deterioration increment.'' (Emphasis added.)By this omission, Maine has failed to adopt a provision as stringent as40 CFR 51.100(kk)(2). However, the Maine DEP has agreed to revise its requirementfor consistency with 40 CFR 51.100(kk)(2), and to submit the revised versionof Chapter 116(II)(E)(2) before EPA takes final rulemaking action on theserevisions.Maine's requirement at Chapter 116(I) is at least as stringent as the definitionof ``ambient air'' at 40 CFR 50.1(e). Maine's regulation further and morespecifically limits inaccessible plant property to only the ``productionarea,'' where ``the source regularly conducts activities necessary to theproduction of goods or services *** which is of a size not larger thanreasonably necessary to conduct such activities ***''EPA's evaluation of Maine's stack height and dispersion techniques requirementsis detailed in a memorandum entitled, ``Technical Support Document_Chapter116 of Maine DEP's Regulations,'' dated December 19, 1988. Copies of thisdocument are available, upon request, from the EPA Regional Office listedin the ADDRESSES section of this notice.C. Amendments to Maine's Stack Height Regulations Necessary for Final ApprovalAs previously stated, Maine's requirements for stack heights and dispersiontechniques at Chapter 116(II) adequately meet the applicable requirementsof 40 CFR 51.100 except for 51.100(kk)(2). The Maine DEP has agreed toadequately revise and submit Chapter 116(II)(E)(2) to include the requirementsof 40 CFR 51.100(kk)(2) before EPA takes final rulemaking action on theserevisions.D. Today's Action<ITAG tagnum="81">Proposed Action</ITAG>EPA proposes to approve and incorporate by reference revisions to SIP regulationChapter 116, ``Prohibited Dispersion Techniques,'' for the permitting ofair emission sources. These revisions incorporate the current provisionsof 40 CFR 50.1(e), 51.100, and 51.118, which specify ambient air, stackheight and dispersion techniques requirements for SIPs. EPA proposes approvalwith the understanding that the Maine DEP will revise and submit Chapter116(II)(E)(2) concerning credit for raising the height of existing stacksas outlined in this notice prior to final EPA approval of these revisions.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Visibility Revisions</ITAG>A. BackgroundCongress set a national goal of preventing any future, and remedying anyexisting, impairment of visibility resulting from manmade air pollutionin mandatory class I federal areas in Section 169A of the Act. On December2, 1980, EPA promulgated Phase I visibility regulations, 40 CFR 51.300through 51.307, to address ``plume blight'' impairment_that impairmentwhich can be traced to a single existing stationary facility or small groupof existing stationary facilities by simple monitoring techniques.Part 51 regulations require that SIPs address the following:<ITAG tagnum="15">1. Coordination with the class I area Federal Land Manager,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">2. Review of proposed new sources for their impact on visibility inclass I areas and integral vistas,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">3. A monitoring strategy for evaluating visibility in class I areas,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">4. Best available retrofit technology (BART) analyses for existingfacilities identified as reasonably anticipated to cause or contributeto visibility impariment in class I areas, and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">5. A long-term strategy (10-15 years) for making reasonable progresstoward the national visibility goal.</ITAG>On July 12, 1985, EPA promulgated a visibility Federal Implementation Plan(FIP) covering the monitoring and new source review provisions for Maineand a number of other states. The FIP was promulgated pursuant to Part1 of a settlement agreement reached in response to a citizen's suit filedin the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California by theEnvironmental Defense Fund (EDF) and other environmental groups, <T3>EDF </T3>v. <T3>Gorsuch, </T3>Number C82-6850 RPA (Dec., 1982).On November 24, 1987 pursuant to Part 2 of the settlement agreement, EPApromulgated a visibility FIP covering the long-term strategy provisionsand revising the new source review FIP to include integral vista provisions.However, the FIP promulgated on November 24, 1987, defers action on BARTcontrol strategies at existing sources.B. Summary of Maine's SubmittalMaine's August 22, 1988 SIP revision submittal includes many of the requirementscovered under EPA's visibility protection regulations at 40 CFR 51.300through 51.307, and therefore, those included in EPA's Part 1 visibilityFIP. A summary of the visibility-related revisions in Maine's August 22,1988 submittal is provided below.<T3>Purpose and Applicability (40 CFR 51.300). </T3>Maine's Chapter 114,``Classification of Air Quality Control Regions,'' correctly lists themandatory class I areas in section (I)(C), both within Maine and withinNew Hampshire where there is any Maine source ``*** the emissions fromwhich may reasonably be anticipated to cause or contribute to any impairmentof visibility in such area'' (40 CFR 51.300(b)(ii)). These class I areasare the following: Acadia National Park, Moosehorn National Wildlife Refuge,and Roosevelt Campobello International Park in Maine, and the PresidentialRange Dry River Wilderness and Great Gulf Wilderness of the White MountainNational Forest in New Hampshire. Maine's Chapter 115(VII)(D)(5)(b) specifiesthe required inclusion in the class I area of any ``conservation easementsunder the jurisdiction of an appropriate Federal Land Manager as of August7, 1977,'' which agrees with EPA's understanding of the Federal Land Manager'soriginal intent for the class I area designation of Acadia National Park.<T3>Definitions. (40 CFR 51.301). </T3>The definitions contained in Maine'sAir Regulations at Chapter 100 are adequate to satisfy the definitionsat 40 CFR 51.301. In two instances the Maine DEP's definitions are morebroadly applicable than the definitions in 40 CFR Part 51:(a) With regard to visibility protection for integral vistas, the MaineDEP definition of ``adverse impace on visibility'' at Chapter 100(2) specificallyincludes effects on integral vistas whereas the definition at 40 CFR 51.301(a)specifically does not; and(b) In choosing not to define ``existing stationary facility'' the MaineDEP rules more widely require BART applicability, because the definitionat 40 CFR 51.301(e) grandfathers sources in existence before August 7,1962 from BART requirements and limits applicability to 26 source categorieshaving the potential to emit greater than 250 tons per year of any visibilityimpairing pollutant.<T3>Implementation control strategies (40 CFR 51.302). </T3>The Maine DEP'ssubmittal adequately meets certain requirements of 40 CFR 51.302, but doesnot include others.The Maine DEP invited each affected Federal Land Manager to attend thepublic workshops and hearings held during the State's adoption of its visibilityregulations as required by 40 CFR 51.302(a). At Chapter 114(I)(C), theMaine DEP lists all federally and state declared integral vistas as requiredby 40 CFR 51.302(b)(1)(i). At Chapter 115(VI)(A)(3), the Maine DEP setsforth BART requirements for existing sources within 5 years of a determinationby the Maine Board of Environmental Protection that emissions from sucha source are reasonably attributable to visibility impairment certifiedby the Federal Land Manager of any class I area or integral vista. In combinationwith the definitions in Chapter 100 of Maine's regulations, this requirementfulfills 40 CFR 51.302(c)(4)(iv).For those requirements of 40 CFR 51.302 that were not included in Maine'sAugust 22, 1988 submittal, the FIP covering those provisions shall remainin effect. (Further discussion of these provisions is provided in III.D.of this notice.) <T3>Integral vistas (40 CFR 51.304). </T3>The Maine DEP adequately identifiesfederally declared integral vistas from Roosevelt Campobello InternationalPark (with one minor exception noted below) at Chapter 114(I)(C) as requiredby 40 CFR 51.304.Additionally, Maine's Chapter 114(I)(C) specifies state declared integralvistas, as viewed from Cadillac Summit and Sunset Point at Acadia NationalPark, which are subject to the same requirements as federally declaredones. In declaring additional integral vistas, the Maine DEP consultedwith the Federal Land Manager.The Maine DEP, in identifying ``key features'' observed from Con Robinson'sPoint at Roosevelt Campobello International Park, inadvertently and erroneouslyindicated ``portions viewed from Liberty Point'' for Herring Cove. TheMaine DEP has agreed to correct this error in its list at Chapter 114(I)(C),and to resubmit the revised list to EPA before final rulemaking actionis taken on these revisions.<T3>Visibility monitoring (40 CFR 51.305). </T3>The Maine DEP regulationsadequately meet EPA's current monitoring requirements for visibility. EPAcurrently participates in the operation of a national visibility monitoringnetwork, ``IMPROVE'', and has not as yet developed a reference method forvisibility monitoring. IMPROVE instruments are currently operating at AcadiaNational Park and Moosehorn Wildlife Refuge. At Chapter 115, the MaineDEP includes requirements allowing it to require visibility monitoringfor the following:1. Existing sources located in or near a class I area where available airquality is limited, or other extenuating circumstances exist (Chapter 115(VIII)(B)(3));2. Minor new sources or modifications as determined on a case-by-case basisconsidering their location including proximity to class I areas, integralvistas (Chapter 115(VII)(C)(3)); and3. Major new sources and modifications, where pre-construction (Chapter115(VII)(D)(5)(e)) and post-construction (Chapter 115(VII)(D)(6)) visibilitymonitoring may be required as the Maine DEP determines is necessary. (Thissatisfies the requirements of 40 CFR 51.307(d).)<T3>New source review (40 CFR 51.307). </T3>The Maine DEP's Air Regulationsat Chapter 115(VII) adequately meet the new source review requirementsat 40 CFR 51.307, with one exception which is discussed below.The Maine DEP's submittal requires that Federal Land Managers receive writtennotification of any proposed new major stationary source or modification,including an analysis of the anticipated visibility impacts on any federalclass I area or integral vista prior to the Maine DEP's acceptance of theapplication and at least 60 days prior to any public hearing. The Maineplan also specifies the circumstances under which such a proposed sourcemust conduct a visibility analysis and lists the appropriate Federal LandManager contacts, thereby fulfilling the requirements of 40 CFR 51.307(a)(1).At chapter 115(VII)(D)(5)(d), the Maine plan requires the Maine DEP toconsider the analysis and comment of any affected Federal Land Managerreceived during the public comment period; specifies the procedures theMaine DEP will follow when it does not concur with a Federal Land Manager'sdetermination that adverse impacts will result (which include the appropriatepublic notice and a mandatory public hearing); and provides that an emissionlicense shall be denied where the Maine DEP concurs with a Federal LandManager finding of adverse impairment. Therefore, Maine's regulations satisfythe requirments of 40 CFR 51.307(a)(3). All of the requirements of Maine's visibility plan for new source reviewapply to federally and state declared integral vistas as well as to mandatoryclass I areas. The Maine visibility regulations also apply to new majorstationary sources and major modifications locating in nonattainment areaswhen those sources may impact a class I area. Therefore, Maine's plan satisfies40 CFR 51.307 (b) and (c). For the provision of 40 CFR 51.307(a)(2) regarding advanced notificationto any affected Federal Land Manager that was not included in Maine's submittal,the FIP covering that provision shall remain in effect. (See III.D. ofthis notice). EPA's detailed evaluation of the Maine DEP's revisions pertaining to visibilityprotection is contained in a memorandum, ``Technical Support Document_Maine'sClass I Visibility Protection Regulations,'' dated December 19, 1988. Copiesof that document are available, upon request, from the EPA Regional Officelisted in the <T2>ADDRESSES </T2>section of this notice. C. Amendments to Maine's Visibility Regulations Necessary for Final ApprovalAs described above, Maine's identification of integral vistas at Chapter114(I)(C) contains an error in identifying a ``key feature'' observed fromRoosevelt Campobello International Park. Prior to final rulemaking on itsAugust 22, 1988 submittal, Maine must correct this error and submit therevised list in Chapter 114(I)(C). D. Today's Actions <ITAG tagnum="81">Proposed Action </ITAG>EPA proposes to approve the visibility-related definitions in the MaineDEP's Air Regulations at Chapter 100; the listing of federally mandatedclass I areas and federally and state declared integral vistas at Chapter114(I)(C) with the understanding that Maine will revise that Chapter asexplained in this notice at III.C., above; the general BART requirementsfor existing sources at Chapter 115(VI)(A)(3); and the visibility-relatedexisting and new source review provisions contained in Chapter 115(VII).While Maine's August 22, 1988 submittal addresses many of the requirementsfor FIPs covered by 40 CFR Part 51's visibility regulations, it shouldbe clearly noted that other provisions of those regulations still requireaction on Maine's part to supersede all of the FIP. Therefore, relevantportions of the FIP will remain in effect in Maine until such time as Mainesubmits additional SIP revisions to address: (1) A long-term strategy for remedying existing impairment as requiredat 40 CFR 51.306; (2) The identification and application of BART and other measures to applicableexisting sources as required at 40 CFR 51.302 (b) and (c)(2), (3) and (4);and (3) Explicit provisions of advanced notification to any affected FederalLand Manager as required at 40 CFR 51.307(a)(2). EPA shall take separate rulemaking actions on those additional SIP revisionsat such time as they are submitted by the Maine DEP for approval. <ITAG tagnum="81">Proposed Action</ITAG>As Maine has essentially met the requirements concerning visibility protectionmonitoring and new source review of 40 CFR 51.305 and 51.307, which areaddressed in the FIP requirements at 40 CFR 52.26 and 52.27, EPA proposesto revise those FIP provisions incorporated into Maine's SIP at 40 CFR52.1032 by deleting the current subsections and inserting the followingtext: ``The requirements of section 169A of the Act are not met becausethe plan does not include approvable procedures for meeting all of therequirements of 40 CFR 51.302, 51.306, or the requirements of 51.307(a)(2)for protection of visibility in mandatory class I Federal areas.'' <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. PMHG Revisions </ITAG>A. Background On July 1, 1987, EPA promulgated a revised national ambient air qualitystandard (NAAQS) for particulate matter (52 FR 2463). EPA revised the olddefinition of the NAAQS from Total Suspended Particulate (TSP) to a newdefinition. The new definition applies to particulate matter with aerodynamicdiameters of 10 micrometers or less. B. Summary of Maine's SubmittalOn August 22, 1988, the Maine DEP submitted amended regulations to EPAas revisions to its SIP. These revisions incorporate NSR-related PM<T2>10</T2> requirements which include changes to the following regulations:Chapter 100, ``Definitions,'' Chapter 110, ``Ambient Air Quality Standards,''and Chapter 115, ``Emissions License Requirements.'' These amendments includethe relevant definitions, the PM<T2>10</T2> standard, the PSD provisions. These amendments do not includethe definitions of the terms ``particulate matter emissions'' and ``PM<T2>10</T2> emissions,'' nor do they include provisions related to significantharm levels and emergency episode plans for PM<T2>10</T2>. Future action by the State of Maine is required to addressthese definitions and provisions.Maine's NSR-related PM<T2>10</T2> regulations and EPA's evaluation are detailed in a memorandumdated January 5, 1989, entitled, ``Technical Support Document-Maine's ParticulateMatter Regulations.'' Copies of that memorandum are available, upon request,from the EPA Regional Office listed in the ADDRESSES section of this notice.C. Amendments to Maine's NSR-Related PM<T2>10 </T2><T3>Requirements Necessary for Final Approval</T3>Forty CFR 51.165(b) requires that States develop a preconstruction permittingprogram for sources which locate in attainment areas and ``cause or contributeto a violation of a NAAQS.'' Chapter 100 of Maine's regulations correctlyincludes the PM<T2>10</T2> significant impact concentrations which define the term ``causeor contribute to a violation of a NAAQS.'' However, Chapter 115 of Maine'sregulations does not state how these significant impact concentrationsare to be applied in regulating new and modified sources of PM<T2>10</T2>. As submitted, Maine's regulations require that sources whichemit a nonattainment pollutant and which locate in or significantly impacta nonattainment area must comply with all of the nonattainment area newsource review provisions (i.e. lowest achievable emission rate, offsets,etc.). However, EPA determined that section 110 of the Act and not PartD, governs the implementation of the PM<T2>10</T2> standards. Therefore, there are no PM<T2>10</T2> nonattainment areas within the meaning of section 107 of theAct. Therefore, Maine's regulations for sources which emit a ``nonattainmentpollutant'' would not apply to new and modified sources of PM<T2>10</T2>. No other provision contained in Maine's August 22, 1988 submittalspecifies how new or modified sources that would cause or contribute toa violation of the PM<T2>10</T2> NAAQS are to be regulated. Therefore, Maine has agreed to adoptthe necessary language to insure that the requirements of 40 CFR 51.165(b)are met for PM<T2>10</T2> prior to final rulemaking approving these revisions.D. Today's Action<ITAG tagnum="81">Proposed Action</ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve Maine's PM<T2>10</T2> related revisions to the following SIP regulations: Chapter100, Definitions,'' Chapter 110, ``Ambient Air Quality Standards,'' Chapter114, ``Classification of Air Quality Control Regions,'' and Chapter 115,``Emission Licensing Regulations.'' These revisions incorporate federalPM<T2>10</T2> requirements for new source review. EPA is proposing approvalwith the understanding that the Maine DEP will revise the regulation asoutlined in this notice prior to final rulemaking approving these revisions.In adopting the Act, Congress designated EPA as the agency primarily responsiblefor interpreting the statutory provisions and overseeing their implementationby the states. EPA must approve state programs that meet the requirementsof 40 CFR Part 51. Conversely, EPA cannot approve programs that do notmeet those requirements. However, the requirements of the Act and 40 CFRPart 51 for NSR including those for PSD, stack heights/dispersion techniques,and visibility are by nature very complex and dynamic. It would be administrativelyimpracticable to include all statutory interpretations in the EPA regulationsand the SIPs of the various states, or to amend the regulations and SIPSevery time EPA interprets the statute or regulations or issues guidanceregarding the proper implementation of the NSR program. Moreover, the Actdoes not require EPA to do so. Rather, action by EPA to approve these NSR-relatedregulations and narrative as part of the Maine SIP still have the effectof requiring the state to follow EPA's current and future interpretationsof the Act's provisions and regulations, as well as EPA's operating policiesand guidance (but only to the extent that such policies are intended toguide the implementation of approved state NSR programs). Similarly, EPAapproval also will have the effect of superceding and interpretations orpolicies that the state might otherwise follow to the extent they are atvariance with EPA's interpretations and applicable policies. Of course,any fundamental changes in the administration of NSR would have to be accomplishedthrough amendments to the regulations in 40 CFR Part 51 and subsequentSIP revisions.Upon approval of these revisions to the NSR requirements of the Maine SIP,EPA will continue to oversee implementation of this important program byreviewing and commenting upon proposed permits as appropriate. Specifically,EPA will comment upon proposed permits that do not implement the letterof the law, as well as EPA's statutory and regulatory interpretations andapplicable guidance. If a final permit is issued which still does not reflectconsideration of the relevant factors, EPA may deem the permit inadequatefor purposes of implementing the requirements of the Act and Maine's SIP,and may consider enforcement action under section 113 and 167 of the Actto address the permit deficiency.EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the Maine SIP, which were submittedon August 22,1988, and is soliciting public comments on issues discussedin this notice or on other relevant matters. These comments will be consideredbefore taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the FederalRulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to the Region I officelisted in the ADDRESSES section of this notice.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (see46 FR 8709.)The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove the plan revisionwill be based on whether it meets the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(A)-(K)and 110(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, and EPA regulations in 40 CFR Part51.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Ozone, Sulfur oxides, Nitrogen dioxide, Lead, Particulatematter, Carbon monoxide, Hydrocarbons, Intergovernmental relations, Ozone,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Paul G.
