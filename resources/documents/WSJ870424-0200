MD-11 jetliners.    The airline, which is 76.5% controlled by Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale, four months ago signed a letter of intent that included the purchase of six of the St. Louis concern's tri-engined, long-range aircraft and options on another four. But the accord was thrown into question when European aircraft builder Airbus Industrie, which is trying to launch a rival long-distance jetliner, made aggressive counteroffers to many of McDonnell Douglas's initial MD-11 customers.    McDonnell Douglas said yesterday that IRI's announcement reconfirms Alitalia's intentions to buy the MD-11s, part of a larger purchase of at least 16 jetliners in a $1.5 billion package. Alitalia's deliveries of MD-11s are set to begin in 1990. </TEXT></DOC>
