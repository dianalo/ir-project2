Bahi el-Din Hussein, deputy chief of the Geneva-based Arab HumanRights Organization's Egyptian chapter, alleged that the prisonerswere beaten with cattle prods.   Attorney General Abdel-Meguid Mahmoud said his department wasinvestigating claims by detainees that they were tortured, but herefused to elaborate.   Authorities arrested 55 journalists, lawyers and activists lastweek for allegedly taking part in a Communist conspiracy.   More than 300 of the roughly 400 journalists working for thestate-run newspaper Al-Ahram have signed petitions seeking therelease of their colleague, Mohammed el-Said Saeed, and twojournalists from the leftist opposition weekly Al-Ahali.   The arrest of Saeed was the first time a reporter from one ofCairo's three government-owned newspapers has been arrested sincePresident Hosni Mubarak took office in 1981.   The protest by his colleagues at the state-run newspaper ishighly unusual. The newspapers are not censored outright, but unlikethe opposition press, they almost never criticize security policiesor activities in their news or editorial columns.   The three journalists were arrested Aug. 24 along with 52 otherpeople in crackdowns on what security officials described as ``anunderground Communist Party.''   The detainees include three lawyers and several workers, whoauthorities said were arrested with documents ``inciting change inthe country's social and political system.''   Hussein told The Associated Press the alleged torture occurredMonday in prison. He said two rows of security policemen flanked thedetainees, beat them with electric cattle prods and draggedjournalist Saeed across the floor.   He said Saeed was tortured so badly that the prison warden wasreluctant to let him meet the visiting head of the Press Syndicate,magazine editor Makram Mohammed Ahmed. The syndicate is theprofessional organization of Egyptian journalists.   Amina Shafik, the syndicate's secretary-general and Saeed'scolleague at Al-Ahram, concurred that the detainees had been beaten.   ``Some of them have been hurt,'' she said. She said, however,that when she visited on Tuesday, Saeed looked well.   Mrs. Shafik said the protest petitions do not refer to beatingsor torture but urge ``improved treatment and release'' of the threejournalists. She said 1988 Nobel Prize-winning writer NaguibMahfouz, a regular columnist at Al-Ahram, also signed the petitionfor presentation to ``various government points.''   Ahmed said he had seen no signs of torture but neverthelessdemanded from prison officials ``better treatment and regular visitsby a doctor. I'm sure treatment has improved now.''   He said Saeed had been on a hunger strike and was in hystericswhen he visited him Monday. Ahmed said he persuaded Saeed to end thestrike.</TEXT></DOC>
