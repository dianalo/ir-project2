The Advanced Photovoltaic ConcentratorProgram is an effort to take advantage of recent advancements in refractiveoptical elements. By using a domed Fresnel lens concentrator and a prismaticcell cover, to eliminate metallization losses, dramatic reductions inthe required area and mass over current space photovoltaic systems arepossible. The advanced concentrator concept also has significant advantageswhen compared to solar dynamic Organic Rankine Cycle power systems inLow Earth Orbit applications where energy storage is required. The programis currently involved in the selection of a material for the opticalelement that will survive the space environment and a demonstration ofthe system performance of the panel design. 7 references.</TEXT></DOC>
