Nukem said Karl-Gerhard Hackstein and Peter Jelinek-Fink were &quot;vacationed,&quot; or suspended, by its supervisory board after an extraordinary meeting yesterday. A third senior Nukem executive resigned earlier this month. The managers will be replaced by executives of Degussa AG, a major shareholder, which is to help reorganize the company.    Nukem has denied allegations brought last week by a senior member of the Social Democratic Party and a German news magazine that Nukem was involved in shipping weapons-grade nuclear material overseas, allegedly to Libya and Pakistan, violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.    Volcker Hauff, deputy chairman of the Social Democrats' parliamentary faction in Bonn, softened his earlier charges of Nukem's involvement. His charges stemmed from an informant whose identity he refuses to divulge, but whose information has been cast into doubt after state prosecutors found no supporting evidence in Nukem files. Mr. Hauff said yesterday he was &quot;rewording&quot; his allegation to show that suspicion remains despite the initial findings of authorities.    West German and Belgian officials, and the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, say they have turned up no evidence that either Belgian interests, Nukem or its Transnuklear G.m.b.H. shipping subsidiary conspired to smuggle fissionable nuclear material overseas. Klaus Toepfer, West Germany's environmental minister, has dismissed Mr. Hauff's allegations as insupportable unless the Social Democrat is able to furnish proof.    The suspension of the Nukem managers was speeded by the prime minister of the state of Hesse, former West German Environmental Minister Walter Wallmann, who last week demanded that Nukem's top management leave the company as part of a general restructuring.    The management shake-up is the latest twist in the matter's escalation into an emotionally charged national issue. The Nukem case is still very short on facts as investigators continue to search for evidence. The highly publicized investigation has nonetheless dented the credibility of the nation's nuclear-power industry, as well as Chancellor Helmut Kohl's pro-nuclear energy policies, both severely tested since the 1986 Soviet nuclear accident at Chernobyl.    In December, the Bonn government suspended the company's license to process nuclear fuels after more than 2,000 illegally stored barrels of radioactive waste were discovered in West Germany. They were suspected to have been illicitly transported from a processing center in Mol, Belgium. Authorities suspect some of the barrels may contain fissionable material.    Nukem, meanwhile, in a statement explaining the management changes, said its supervisory board &quot;has no doubts as to the correctness of Nukem management in its presentation last Friday regarding the allegations being raised in the public&quot; about overseas shipments. But the company said the changes were meant to help it and its 900 employees &quot;resume normal functions as quickly as possible.&quot;    Degussa, a chemical and precious-metals group, owns a 35% stake in Nukem, a principal supplier of nuclear fuel to West German nuclear power plants. Another major shareholder, Rheinisch Westfaelisches Electrizitaetswerke AG, or RWE, an Essen-based power company, owns a 45% Nukem stake.    At Degussa, a spokesman said that, as a Hessian company that also is based in Frankfurt, near Hanau, Degussa was in a better position than RWE to furnish personnel and other support to resurrect Nukem's scandal-plagued operations.    Degussa's Bernhard Liebmann, management board executive for metals technology, will assume the top management job of Nukem. Mr. Liebmann will run Nukem with the aid of other Degussa managers brought over from its Frankfurt headquarters. In addition, Degussa's management board chairman, Gert Becker, was named as the new chairman of Nukem's supervisory board. The current Nukem supervisory board chairman, RWE management board member Franz Josef Spalthoff, will become deputy chairman of the Nukem board. </TEXT></DOC>
