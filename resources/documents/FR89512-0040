Exercising our rulemakingpower under the Act, we issued regulations at 9 CFR Part 11, referred tobelow as the regulations, that prohibit soring devices and soring methods.In 1979, in response to congressional mandate, we established proceduresunder which, in addition to our personnel, other designated individualsare trained to conduct pre-show inspections. These individuals, referredto as Designated Qualified Persons (DQP's), are trained and licensed underindustry-sponsored DQP programs that we certify and supervise. The requirements for DQP licensing are set forth in andSection; 11.7 of theregulations. As part of the licensing process, prospective DQP's are trainedin the guidelines we have established for examining a horse prior to exhibition.These inspection procedures include both palpation of the horse's pasternsand visual examination of the horse. However, representatives of both thehorse industry and animal welfare organizations have suggested that thecurrent guidelines for pre-show examination of a horse are not detailedenough to ensure a uniform and adequate inspection of all horses examinedby DQP's. We agree that a clarification of inspection procedures wouldprobably result in more thorough examination of horses inspected underthe Act. Therefore, at this time we are soliciting comments on how bestto clarify and make more specific pre-show inspection guidelines, so asto most effectively detect sore horses.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>15 U.S.C. 1823, 1824, 1825, and 1828; 44 U.S.C. 3506.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Done in Washington, DC, this 8th day of May 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
