LIM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thousands of students demanding thearrest of former President Chun Doo-hwan clashed with riot policeThursday in one of the worst street protests in recent months.   President Roh Tae-woo, on an overseas trip, said he was nottroubled and hoped political turmoil in his country would end ``inthe not-too-distant future.''   ``I am not much worried about the student protests. Theircomplaints will eventually disappear in a huge melting furnace ofdemocratic political reforms,'' Roh told reporters aboard a planewhich took him to Malaysia, Australia, Indonesia and Brunei.   Police said more than 20,000 students from 80 colleges took partin anti-Chun campus rallies or street protests in Seoul and a dozenprovincial cities on Thursday, national students' day. They accusedthe former president of corruption and violating human rights.   About 50 students were arrested, mostly in Seoul, said police.They gave no injury figures, but said some youths and policemensuffered cuts and burns.   In Seoul, about 5,000 students threw firebombs at 9,000 riotpolice who blocked their march to Chun's house in a fashionableresidential district.   Police in armored vans retaliated by firing barrages of tear gas.   Many pedestrians and residents cried with pain and choked in adense fog of the acrid gas.   Traffic came to a halt and most shops in the area closed as thefierce fighting continued for several hours.   All but a handful of protesters were kept well away from thehouse. Four youths came within 50 yards of Chun's home and explodedtwo crude homemade plastic explosives. The four were arrested bypolice before they escaped.   The students' anger appeared centered on the former president,but they also berated his successor.   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan. Punish (President) Roh Tae-woo,'' theyshouted.   It was the worst political clash in Seoul since majoranti-American protests in the early summer.   In about a dozen other provincial cities, including Pusan,Chunchon, Suwon and Ansung, protesters threw firebombs at a policesub-station, a prosecutor's office and a government party building.No injuries or major damage were reported.   Anti-government demonstrations have escalated in recent weekswith radical students organizing ``Save-the-Nation Suicide Squads''and threatening to raid Chun's house to press for his punishment.   With public sentiment against Chun, his opponents have beenpressing for his arrest. The general antipathy has spilled over toRoh, who critics say has been slow to investigate the corruptioncharges.   Roh and Chun, both former army generals, have been close friendssince they were classmates at Korea Military Academy in the 1950s.Roh succeeded Chun, who stepped down at the end of a seven-year termin February.   Chun also is being investigated for his alleged role in puttingdown a 1980 civil uprising in southern Kwangju city. About 200people died in the military crackdown.</TEXT></DOC>
