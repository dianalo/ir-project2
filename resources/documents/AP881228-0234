Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, vowing to tighten politicaldiscipline, formed a new Cabinet on Tuesday with 15 new members outof 20. But the balance of political factions was unchanged, and theleadership of his Liberal Democratic Party stayed the same eventhough two of the top three party positions are held by men taintedby scandal.   Media commentators were virtually unanimous in saying the Cabinetreshuffle did not cure the ``Recruit Scandal.''   ``It is regrettable that we cannot feel any hope for a change,''the Asahi Shimbun editorial said Wednesday. The newspaper, whichtook a leading role in uncovering the scandal, noted that manyprominent politicians who profited by receiving shares in a RecruitCo. subsidiary stayed in power.   ``We are concerned that they will cover for each other in anyprobe of the scandal,'' the paper said.   The affair has tarnished Japan's international image, and the newjustice minister, Takashi Hasegawa, 76, told a news conferenceTuesday that the public was losing confidence in politics, businessand public officials.   ``For Japan to be trusted in the international arena, we have tostart with establishing a trustworthy political system,'' Hasegawasaid.   But within 24 hours Hasegawa was revealed to have receivedregular donations from Recruit Co., including a donation in Octoberwhen the scandal was front-page news every day. Over 12 years hispolitical organization got $46,000 from Recruit, Hasegawa confirmedin a post-midnight news conference.   The donations to Hasegawa were legal and quite different from thestock transactions in a Recruit subsidiary that put many politiciansin hot water, but the belated revelation showed how wide the Recruitscandal goes.   The scandal began unfolding last summer with disclosures that thefounder of the Recruit conglomerate, Hiromasa Ezoe, soldbargain-priced shares in a real-estate subsidiary calledRecruit-Cosmos to politicians or their aides, business leaders andmedia figures before the shares were listed.   The purchases often were financed by loans from another Recruitsubsidiary. When the shares were listed in October 1986 and theprice doubled, shareholders made tax-free profits of up to $150,000.   The transactions were not illegal, but it is widely assumed thatEzoe was seeking business advantage and prestige. The astoundingscope of the scandal brought suspicion of something approachingwidespread bribery.   Former Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa heads the roster of 17politicians and business leaders who resigned in the scandal. Aformer Recruit official pleaded guilty to trying to bribe anopposition parliament member to tone down his investigation.   Takeshita's poll ratings are sharply down, but his conservativeparty is the most firmly entrenched governing party among thecapitalist democracies. It has been in power since World War II withthe exception of 10 months of a socialist Cabinet in 1947-48.   Japan has become an economic superpower under the LiberalDemocrats, who fostered growth, helped troubled industries modernizeand promoted exports. The business world has demonstrated itsgratitude with generous donations.   The resulting ``money politics'' caused a huge scandal in the1970s in the time of Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, who was convictedof taking a $1.7 million bribe from the U.S. aircraft maker Lockheed.   The Liberal Democrats won 304 of 524 seats in the powerful lowerhouse in the 1986 election, but they still run scared at electiontime, and the political appetite for money keeps growing.   Because the electoral system has multiple-seat constituencies,several Liberal Democrats may run for the same seat and eachcandidate needs lots of money.   Politicians also say they are victimized by the Japanese customof generous gift-giving. They say they need money far beyond theirsalary and expense allowance to give lavishly at constituents'weddings and funerals.   Takeshita, who was touched by the scandal when an aide profitedfrom Recruit-Cosmos shares, told a news conference Wednesday he issetting goals on improving political ethics.   He said that before next summer's election of half of the upperhouse of the Diet, Japan's parliament, some progress will be made,and he hoped for more progress in 1990.   The prime minister said reform committees will deal withpolitical donations and fund-raising parties, and they also willtake a long-term look at the election system.   ``I support the idea that political reform is at the base of allproblems,'' he said. ``Each politician including myself must alwaystake into account an ethical platform. If each one takesprecautions, I believe this will be reflected in daily governmentaffairs. But it is first necessary to create the environment to makethis possible.''   Analyst Garrett N. Scalera, president of the Tokyo Institute ofPolicy Studies, said the Diet probably will outlaw dubious donationslike Recruit-style sales of prelisted shares, but he thought reformwould end there.   ``If you're talking about political reform in the sense of Dietmembers not taking money from business or farming organizations,it's really impossible, it's too radical a reform,'' Scalera said inan interview.   After the chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co., Japan'shuge telephone utility, resigned on Dec. 14 because of links to thescandal, the country's four biggest business organizations said theRecruit affair was causing ``distrust of the corporate world'' andcould ``damage the free enterprise system.''   The business organizations urged their members to ``take thisproblem seriously as a matter of corporate morality.''   But on the political level, the Liberal Democrats control all thelevers of change. The opposition parties are doubly hobbled becausethey lack power in the Diet and have figures who profited fromRecruit-Cosmos shares.</TEXT></DOC>
