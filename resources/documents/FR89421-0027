Background on the West Virginia Program</ITAG>On March 3, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior received a proposed permanentregulatory program from the State of West Virginia. On October 22, 1980,following a review of the proposed program in accordance with 30 CFR Part732, the Secretary approved in part and disapproved in part the proposedprogram (45 FR 69249-69271).West Virginia resubmitted its proposed program on December 19, 1980, whichwas conditionally approved on January 21, 1981. Information concerningthe general background of the permanent program submission, as well asthe Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments and explanation ofthe initial conditions of approval of the West Virginia program can befound in the January 21, 1981, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(46 FR 5915-5956). Subsequent actions concerningproposed amendments and the conditions of approval are codified at 30 CFR948.11, 948.12, 948.13, 948.15, and 948.16.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of Proposed Amendments</ITAG>As discussed above, West Virginia's permanent regulatory program was conditionallyapproved by the Secretary of the Interior on January 21, 1981.On July 11, 1985, the Director of OSMRE approved the West Virginia EnergyAct (WVEA) as an amendment to the West Virginia program, with the exceptionof nine provisions which were required to be amended by March 15, 1986.On July 11, 1985, the Director also approved in part the State's revisedregulations that were submitted on June 14, 1985. The Director's approvalresulted in the removal of ten conditions. The State was given until January11, 1986, to satisfy six remaining conditions (50 FR 28316-28345).Because of legislative scheduling problems, on February 10, 1986, the Statenotified OSMRE that it would not be able to meet the January 11, 1986,deadline for addressing the six regulatory conditions and the March 15,1986, deadline for satisfying the nine required statutory amendments (AdministrativeRecord No. WV 707). On June 30, 1986, the State requested that the submissiondeadlines for both the conditions and the required amendments be extendedto April 15, 1987 (Administrative Record No. WV 709). On November 10, 1986, the Secretary approved the State's request and extendedthe deadline for the submission of materials satisfying the remaining conditionsof program approval and the required statutory amendments until April 15,1987 (51 FR 40795-40796). On April 6, 1987, the State informed OSMRE that it was unable to initiateaction on its legislative proposals to satisfy its program conditions bythe April 15, 1987, deadline. The State requested that the deadline beextended for one year (Administrative Record No. WV 733). On June 19,1987, OSMRE requested that the State enact emergency regulationsto satisfy the six remaining regulatory conditions. OSMRE acknowledgedthe State's request for a one year extension to satisfy its nine requiredstatutory amendments (Administrative Record No. WV 754). On July 1, 1987, DOE advised OSMRE that it was unable to develop a workableset of emergency regulations to satisfy its regulatory conditions. TheState indicated that the conditions would be addressed in the regulatoryreform package which it was developing in response to OSMRE's regulatoryreform letter of August 19, 1986. The State planned to submit the entirepackage to the Legislative Rulemaking Review Committee in late August (AdministrativeRecord No. WV 735). On October 19, 1987, DOE and OSMRE officials met to discuss the remainingconditions on West Virginia's permanent regulatory program. At the meeting,the State agreed to submit emergency regulations to satisfy all but oneof its conditions. State officials later advised OSMRE that given the complexityof the task and to avoid confusing the Legislature, they only planned tosubmit emergency regulations to satisfy one condition relating to complianceinformation requirements for permit applications (Administrative RecordWV 738). On October 27, 1987, the State submitted a proposed program amendmentto OSMRE. The amendment contained an emergency rule that was filed withthe Secretary of State on October 21, 1987, to satisfy the condition at30 CFR 948.11(a)(19) relating to compliance information (AdministrativeRecord No. WV 743). In October 1987, and again in January 1988, DOE submitted revised regulationsto the Legislative Rulemaking Review Committee. The West Virginia Legislatureadjourned in March 1988, without adopting DOE's proposed regulations. Dueto unforeseen problems, DOE's proposed legislation to satisfy its ninerequired statutory amendments was never submitted to the Legislature forconsideration. On July 7, 1988, DOE submitted a proposed amendment to OSMRE which containedsurface mining reclamation regulations and coal refuse disposal regulationswhich the State filed with the Secretary of State on an emergency basison July 15, 1988 (Administrative Record No. WV 756). The revised regulationsare intended to satisfy five of the remaining conditions imposed on theWest Virginia program on July 11, 1985, and set forth at 30 CFR 948.11(a).The existing conditions concern stability analyses for coal mine wastepiles, inspection requirements for coal mine waste piles, inspection requirementsfor coal mine waste disposal areas, compliance information requirementsfor permit applications, critical habitats of threatened and endangeredspecies with respect to coal exploration permit applications, revegetationsuccess standards and evaluation techniques and the issuance of show causeorders for patterns of violations. A portion of the condition relatingto satistical sampling techniques and productivity measurements for revegetationis to be addressed later in the State's Technical Handbook. In addition,the State revised certain permit application, bonding, water monitoring,backfilling, and incidental mining requirements. On August 10, 1988, DOE revised its emergency regulations that were submittedto OSMRE on July 7, 1988. The revisions were filed with the Secretary ofState on August 5, 1988, as emergency amendments to the emergency regulationsfiled on July 15, 1988. The revisions were necessary to correct a numberof typographical and editorial errors. DOE also made significant revisionsto the applicability section of the regulations and deleted the acreagelimit for incidental boundary revisions for underground mining operations(Administrative Record WV 766).On September 9, 1988, DOE held a public hearing on the revised emergencyregulations, and on September 19, 1988, DOE submitted its revised emergencyregulations to the Legislative Rulemaking Review Committee for consideration.On November 29, 1988, the State provided OSMRE a list of minor changesthat had been made to its revised emergency regulations that had been filedwith the Secretary of State on August 5, 1988. The most significant revisionconcerned the inspection of coal refuse piles (Administrative Record No.WV 767).<ITAG tagnum="84">III.
