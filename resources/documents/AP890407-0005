They call it Kushtargah,``the place of slaughter.''   Bodies of guerrillas, soldiers, civilians and livestock arescattered along the road to the Pakistan border 45 miles away.   Explosions of artillery shells and aerial bombs shake the groundday and night, creating plumes of smoke, dirt and debris.   Western reporters accompanied 25 guerrillas under a commandercalled Shomali on an assault. Insurgents farther back providedcover with rockets and mortar shells that whistled overhead andexploded inside the airport.   Government forces responded with mortar fire and jets came inlow to attack. Two transport helicopters quickly lifted off andflew away.   Advancing guerrillas hit a helicopter gunship with aBritish-made Blowpipe missile and it crashed inside Jalalabad.   They covered 50 yards in stop-and-go fashion, arrived atKushtargah and spotted a tank at the airport's edge 100 yards away.   Shomali and his brother, who was second in command, set up aMilan anti-tank missile with the help of a mujahedeen who lookedabout 15 years old.   The tank fired one shell, a direct hit. Shomali was criticallywounded in the head. His brother and the boy were killed.   Comrades in the rear continued covering fire. One rocket fellshort and hit the survivors, killing one and wounding three. Theothers fled in panic, having spent only a few minutes at ``theplace of slaughter.''   Insurgents known as mujahedeen, the Islamic ``holy warriors''who began fighting after a communist coup 11 years ago, besiegedJalalabad a month ago in their first major offensive since theSoviet army withdrew Feb. 15.   They surprised critics by swiftly capturing the heavilyfortified Samarkhel garrison on the city's outskirts, but theiradvance has bogged down. The guerrillas advance, shoot, thenretreat under withering artillery and aerial bombardment fromdefenders who outgun them with Soviet weapons.   Mujahedeen use multibarreled rocket launchers, 82mm and 120mmmortars, and tanks and artillery taken from captured Afghan armyposts, but have difficulty mastering them after a decade ofhit-and-run tactics.   Soldiers defending the city and its strategic airport appearwell-supplied with such weapons as napalm and airburst artillery.The artillery and cluster bombs dropped by jets screaming in at lowaltitude are particularly deadly.   Both shells and bombs explode a few hundred feet above theground, spraying shrapnel into the trenches.   Scud-B missiles are feared most. They are fired from governmentpositions near Kabul and tear craters in the earth 120 feet across.   No one seems to know how many combatants and civilians have beenkilled, and the claims of each about the other's losses areexaggerated, but it is clear from the scene that the toll has beenhigh.   Afghan officials have offered cease-fires and declared themunilaterally since well before the Red Army ended its nine-yearinvolvement, and did so again Wednesday, but nothing has come ofthe effort.   The battle continued around Jalalabad, 75 miles east of thecapital, and witnesses and the government said the mujahedeen firedrockets Thursday at Kabul, Kandahar and Sarobi.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said governmentsoldiers withheld their fire. The government timed the unilateraltruce to coincide with the eve of Ramadan, the Moslem holy month ofdawn-to-dusk fastingg.   Associated Press photographer Morten Hvaal saw a missile hit afuel truck near a oil depot on Kabul's northern edge and severaltrucks parked nearby also exploded. There was no immediate word oncasualties.   An Afghan truck driver who said he was part of a convoy haulingfuel down the Salang Highway from Hayratan on the Soviet bordersaid mujahedeen tried to hijack some of the trucks about six milesnorth of Kabul.   He said the hijackers got about a mile down the road before twogovernment helicopters attacked. Hvaal saw black smoke rising fromthe area.</TEXT></DOC>
