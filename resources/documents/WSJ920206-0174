C. Olivetti andamp; Co., the Italian officeautomation equipment manufacturer, incurred a loss of around380 billion lire ($317.7 million) in 1991, Chairman Carlo DeBenedetti indicated yesterday.   The loss is much bigger than generally expected byfinancial analysts. &quot;It is way over expectations. I haven'tseen anyone mention this figure,&quot; said David Roberts, Italyanalyst for Nomura Research Institute in London.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. De Benedetti told a news conference in Davos,Switzerland, that Olivetti's 1991 loss as a percentage ofsales would be &quot;something similar&quot; to the 4.4% deficit postedby International Business Machines Corp. IBM reported aconsolidated loss of $2.8 billion on sales of $64 billion.   Olivetti disclosed last month that consolidated revenuereached 8.6 trillion lire in 1991, down 4.8% from 9.036trillion lire in 1990. A 4.4% deficit ratio would putOlivetti's 1991 loss at 378 billion lire.   Mr. De Benedetti wouldn't discuss a specific estimate oflast year's loss and said the bottom line would depend onwhether some restructuring costs would be accounted for onlast year's or this year's profit-and-loss account. Final1991 results will be released in May.   Massimo Verduci, an analyst with Milan brokerage Pastorinoandamp; Partners, viewed Olivetti's estimated loss as &quot;very bad&quot;and &quot;certainly much worse than expected.&quot;   The announcement didn't immediately affect Olivetti'sshare price. Olivetti common stock closed at 2,847 lire onthe Milan Stock Exchange, up 33 lire. Traders attributed thestock's advance to speculation that, despite repeated denialsby Mr. De Benedetti, Olivetti is likely to forge a broadalliance, including a share swap, with another computercompany.   The Italian financier did say, however, that, provided theeconomy remains flat in 1992, Olivetti would break even oreven post a small profit this year.</TEXT></DOC>
