About 5,000 troopers stopped 1,000 students a few blocks fromMyongdong Cathedral in the city center. Police charged into thecolumn of protesters several times, dragging away strugglingstudents in a confrontation that lasted four hours.   Although most protesters were peaceful, some tried to ramthrough police lines to reach the cathedral, where at least 60students are staging a hunger strike.   Some riot police kicked and beat screaming demonstrators as theywere hauled away. Police said there were injuries among thetroopers and students but said they had no figures.   Earlier, 4,000 students took part in rallies at 13 Seoulcolleges calling for the resignation of President Roh Tae-woo.   They also want the government to admit responsibility in thedeath of radical student Lee Chol-kyu, who they say was torturedand killed by police. A government report said Lee died when heslipped into a reservoir while fleeing troopers and there was noevidence of police torture.   The students shouted ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Bring backLee Chol-kyu!''   The campus protests were peaceful, except at Sogang University,where 300 students battled police with firebombs and rocks. Atleast six officers and students were hurt, police said.   Hundreds of students hurling rocks also clashed with police insouthern Kwangju, near where Lee's body was found in a reservoir onMay 10.   About 300 students began the hunger strike May 25 to demand thegovernment admit that police killed Lee, but their number haddwindled to about 60 on Tuesday. Student leaders said Wednesdaymore students joined the strike and 500 were participating, butthere was no way to check that figure.   Doctors said eight fasters were hospitalized after collapsingand scores began eating because of weakness.   On Wednesday night, riot police blocked the hunger strikers andabout 300 protesters when they tried to march out of the cathedralfor a candlelight parade. Lines of police stopped the march, butthere was no violence.   Some radical students have called for peaceful protests aftersix riot troopers were killed May 3 in a campus demonstration. Thedeaths outraged public opinion in South Korea. The radicals lackpublic support because of their violent tactics and extreme views.   Students said the cathedral protest is based on the same tacticsas those used by Chinese students in the pro-democracy protest inBeijing.   South Korea's largest dissident group, the United NationalDemocratic Movement, Wednesday announced plans to become afull-fledged political party.   The movement _ about 200 minor dissident groups with anestimated total membership of 400,000 _ has led many violentdemonstrations against the government, which it labels asdictatorial.   It has weakened considerably in recent months after most of itsleaders, including co-chairman Lee Bu-young, were either arrestedor driven underground by police.</TEXT></DOC>
