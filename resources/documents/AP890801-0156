LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The army seized 100 rockets andarrested about 50 people in raids aimed at ending devastatingrocket attacks on Kabul by Moslem guerrillas, the government saidTuesday.   No rockets fell on the city Tuesday, but 14 fired Monday killed24 people and wounded 58.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said the militarywas given urgent instructions Monday to take whatever actionnecessary to stop the attacks, which have occurred almost dailysince late June.   U.N. sources say 281 people have been killed and 745 woundedsince June 25 in rocket attacks and a car bombing. Virtually allthe victims were civilians.   A major search operation started late Monday and continued intoTuesday in the city and environs, Amani said, and government forcesconfiscated many documents and weapons and made about 50 arrests.   No group claimed responsibility for the rocket attacks. TheSoviet-sponsored government blames the U.S.-backed guerrillas, whobegan fighting after a communist coup in April 1978.   Amani also reported new fighting between rival fundamentalistguerrilla groups, Hezb-e-Islami and the Jamiat-e-Islami, in Heratprovince near the Iranian border.   He said 12 members of Jamiat-e-Islami were killed and sixwounded, and six supporters of Hezb-e-Islami were wounded. He gaveno date for the fighting.   Guerrillas sources have said Hezb-e-Islami supporters attacked aJamiat group July 9 in northern Afghanistan, killing 30 people,including several field commanders.   Fighting among guerrilla groups has been mentioned as one reasonthey have failed to oust the government since the Red Army withdrewin February after nine years of involvement in the civil war.   In Stockholm, Sweden, on Tuesday, the United States and SovietUnion held their first meeting on Afghanistan since the Sovietwithdawal.   After his meeting with Soviet Ambassador Nikolai Kozyrev, JohnKelly, assistant U.S. secretary of state, said there was a ``frankexchange of views'' and ``significant differences'' remained.   The Soviets complain of U.S. aid to the insurgents andWashington says the Kremlin has increased arms shipments to theKabul government.   Western diplomats in neighboring Pakistan reported an attempt inKabul to overthrow President Najib and said a house-to-house searchfor suspected conspirators had increased tensions within the rulingCommunist Party.   One said the hint of a coup attempt emerged about two weeks ago.   ``There is no indication of how close to being launched thereported plot was when it was discovered,'' the diplomat said,speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Multiple sources havereported a sudden upsurge in tension within'' the ruling party.   A leftist Pakistan newspaper, The Frontier Post, said DefenseMinister Shah Nawaz Tanai was under house arrest for allegedinvolvement in the attempt against Najib, who uses only one name.   It quoted the pro-guerrilla Afghan Media Resource Center. Thediplomats said the claim could not be substantiated.</TEXT></DOC>
