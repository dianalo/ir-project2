The service is still trying to decide how to repair the fivemissiles, which account for 10 percent of the nation's MX force, TheWashington Post reported today.   Despite taking the warheads off five missiles, the service stillclaimed last month that the MX had reached ``full operationalcapability'' on Dec. 30.   The decision to remove the warheads followed an incident lastJune in Wyoming. According to the newspaper, one of the missilesbecame ``unglued'' from its underground launch canister.   The missile fell six inches to a foot and had to undergoextensive repairs, the Post said, quoting unnamed Air Forceofficials.   An Air Force investigating panel concluded that the missile wasone of a batch of five which had production problems, the Post said.   Air Force officials responded to the report by ordering removalof the 10-warhead package atop each of the five suspect missiles,according to the newspaper.   The Air Force has been authorized to build 50 of the missiles anddeploy them in underground silos in Wyoming and Nebraska. The weaponwill join the Minuteman as the core of the nation's land-basednuclear missile deterrent force.   The Air Force has not publicly released details of the twoincidents and Pentagon officials contacted Tuesday night said theyhad no information on them.   In the incident last June, a key electrical wire was cut. Thewire is normally severed during launch and may have briefly causedconcern that the weapon was being launched, the Post said. ButPentagon officials told the newspaper there was no danger of anaccidental launch.</TEXT></DOC>
