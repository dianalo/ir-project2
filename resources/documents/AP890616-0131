South American drug dealers have been making increasing use ofCuban air space and territorial waters for U.S.-bound narcoticsdeliveries, an activity that U.S. officials last week said stronglysuggested the collaboration of Cuban authorities.   Cuba is directly in the flight path between Colombia and southFlorida, and the number of suspicious northbound flights throughCuban airspace has increased in the past several months, accordingto administration officials.   The Coast Guard also has detected an increase in air drops ofdrugs into Cuban territorial waters. The cargo is then picked up byspeedboats for delivery to U.S. ports, the officials said.   ``To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the Cubangovernment has admitted involvement of Cuban officials in drugsmuggling operations,'' Margaret Tutwiler, the State Departmentspokesman, said of the arrest of Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa.   The Cuban party newspaper Granma said Ochoa had been taken intocustoday because he engaged in ``grave acts of corruption anddishonest use of economic resources.''   Ochoa is a veteran of fighting in Angola and Ethiopia and alsoserved as commander of Cuban forces in Nicaragua in the mid-1980s.According to Rafael Fermoselle, a Cuban exile and an expert on theCuban military, Ochoa was awarded the title ``Hero of theRevolution'' in 1984.   Ms. Tutwiler noted that the June 15 edition of Cuba's CommmunistParty newspaper had accused Ochoa and and other officials ``ofmaking contacts with international drug traffickers and reachingagreements with them.''   She also pointed out that Cuba Radio reported that two armedforce officers and four ministry of interior officers had beenarrested, and quoted the report as saying that ``it is possible thatOchoa and his accomplices cooperated in drug trafficking operationsnear Cuban territory.''   The spokeswoman said the administration hopes ``the chargesagainst Ochoa and the other officers will be investigated and, iffound true, will be prosecuted to the fullest extent possible.''   Meanwhile, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., Foreign RelationsCommittee chairman, said, ``This arrest could open the way formutually beneficial cooperation between the United States and Cubato combat the narcotics trafficking that is taking place in the seaand air space that we share.''   Pell earlier proposed that the U.S. Coast Guard and the Cubanborder patrol cooperate on narcotics interdiction.</TEXT></DOC>
