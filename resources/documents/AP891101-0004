The still-ardent revolutionary, Mohammad Ibrahim Azgharzadeh,also insists that even today there can be no accommodation withAmerica.   ``In the light of the very nature of the United States, the roleWashington plays in guiding anti-revolutionary elements and itsanti-Islamic stand, there's no possibility of considering theresumption of diplomatic relations,'' Azgharzadeh said.   The Tehran embassy was overrun on Nov. 4, 1979. Many embassypersonnel were soon freed, but 52 diplomats and other staff memberswere held hostage for 444 days, accused of operating a ``den ofspies.'' They were finally released Jan. 20, 1981, the day JimmyCarter left the U.S. presidency and Ronald Reagan was sworn in.   The crisis was resolved when the United States pledged not tointerfere in Iran's internal affairs and the two countriesestablished a framework for settling billions of dollars in claimsagainst each other. Washington severed formal relations with Iranduring the crisis, and they have not been resumed.   The bearded Azgharzadeh, bespectacled and intense, is asanti-American now as he was in the chaotic early days of therevolution.   ``If the so-called embassy had not been seized and theAmericans' spying activities stopped, the revolution would havebeen in danger,'' he told The Associated Press in an interview.   Azgharzadeh, 34, one of 270 members of the Majlis, Iran'sparliament, said the embassy takeover was carefully planned,``taking into account all the possible consequences.''   One of these ``consequences'' was to bring down Iran's firstrevolutionary government, headed by a liberal prime minister, MehdiBazargan, because of what Azgharzadeh said was its alleged secretdealings with Washington.   ``We knew that the capture of the embassy would result in thefall of the interim government and we had information about thesecret dealings between the two,'' he added.   A week before the embassy seizure, Bazargan had met withCarter's national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, inAlgeria. Two days after the hostage seizure in Tehran, Bazarganresigned.   Azgharzadeh said the Bazargan government had refused to take anyaction against the United States ``and this was against the viewsof the leader of the revolution,'' Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, whobranded the United States the ``Great Satan'' for supporting ShahMohammad Reza Pahlavi's regime, brought down in February 1979.   ``Three of us planned the seizure of the embassy because we wereconvinced that the mission was doing things other than conductingnormal diplomatic activities,'' Azgharzadeh said.   He did not name the other organizers. But several leaders of theembassy militants have, like Azgharzadeh, risen to positions ofpower and influence in the past decade.   Among them are Hussein Sheikholeslam, now a deputy foreignminister and a key radical. Another is a middle-ranking cleric,Hojatoleslam Mohammad Musavi Khoeiniha, who was prosecutor-generaluntil he was dropped by President Hashemi Rafsanjani after hiselection last July.   The former embassy compound, covering a city block and sealedoff to most Iranians and all foreigners, is now a school for Iran'sRevolutionary Guards Corps.   Young guards with close-cropped black beards, symbol ofrevolutionary manhood, and armed with automatic weapons stare downstonily from elevated sentry boxes atop the embassy's perimeterwall along Talaghani Avenue in central Tehran.   The walls are daubed with slogans in foot-high letters. Onereads, ``We will make America face a severe defeat.'' Another, ``IfGod wills, this century will be the period of victory of theoppressed of the world over the oppressors.''   Officials decline to say what goes on behind the high walls ofthe sprawling compound, which housed the embassy, living quartersfor diplomats and a pine-studded park.   But a cloth banner strung above the iron gates of the mainentrance advertise classes in martial arts _ karate and taekwondo _``open to all who register.''   Ten years ago, the embassy was besieged every day by thousandsof Iranians chanting support for Khomeini and fired up byanti-American speeches.   These days it is much more tranquil. But that could be shatteredSaturday, 10th anniversary of the takeover. Radicals have calledfor anti-American protests, although the government has notofficially scheduled demonstrations.   Officials have also said that some of the scores of Iraniansarrested earlier this year as alleged U.S. spies will publiclyconfess in Tehran on Sunday, probably inflaming anti-U.S. passionsat a time when Rafsanjani, leader of Tehran's ``pragmatists,'' isbelieved to be seeking to end Iran's political isolation.</TEXT></DOC>
