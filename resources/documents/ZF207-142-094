(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Use of PC LANs Spreads, Especially at DEC SitesandM;Local area networks (LANs) are on the rise--largely in the DEC marketplace.andM;LAN use is growing rapidly in many business applications, and the majority ofcurrent LAN sites are in DEC environments, according to Computer Intelligence(CI), a market research company based in LA Jolla, Calif.andM;&quot;There has been a trend ...andP;  to move toward LANs in the DEC market,&quot; saidMary Modahl, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.andM;&quot;General-purpose LANs are growing more slowly--I'd say under 10 percent ayear--[but PC] LANs are growing very, very fast, over 30 percent a year.andO;They're driven by growth in personal computers and workstations, and moves toclient-server computing,&quot; she said.andM;In contrast, IBM environments are less connectivity-oriented.andP;  Although they,too, are taking on more LANs, they are trailing in LAN use, according to CI.andM;&quot;DEC and the rest of the world have done a much better job of interconnectingtheir LANs,&quot; said John McConnell, president of Network Technology Group, aBoulder, Colo., market research firm.andP;  &quot;They have gateways that areintelligent and can move routes [to channel information] past systemfailures.&quot;andM;Figures show that 57 percent of VAX sites use general-purpose LANs, and 13percent are planning to install them.andP;  Only 14 percent of IBM sites currentlyuse general-purpose LANs, and eight percent plan to use them in the future.andM;PC LANs tell a different story.andP;  Sixteen percent of VAX sites have PC LANsinstalled and three percent are planning PC LAN installations, while 29percent of IBM sites use PC LANs and 11 percent are planning installations.andM;The reason for IBM's lag in general-purpose LAN use dates back to the twocompanies' long-term philosophies, according to industry analysts.andM;The IBM environments has historically turned to the more inflexible channelconnections instead of LANs.andP;  With the increase in connectivity to othervendors, however, the IBM LAN market is now heating up as well, analysts say.andM;&quot;IBM really hasn't made LANs a regular part of their architecture.andP;  Rightnow, you can't really bring mainframes into a LAN.andP;  But they're trying tobeef up the front end&quot; in an effort to attract more LAN use, McConnell said.andM;On the other hand, for DEC, &quot;LANs were always a basic part of their plan,&quot;McConnell said.andP;  More recently, DEC has been &quot;pushing to improve their rangeof connectivity products [by using] proprietary protocols across a DECnetbackbone.andP;  They're still positioning themselves to be in the heterogeneousmultivendor environment,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;Historically, it makes sense,&quot; McConnell added.andP;  &quot;Back in the '60s, everyonewas trying to find a niche that IBM didn't want.andP;  DEC picked connectivity.&quot;andM;Now IBM is trying to catch up, he said.andM;As part of the effort, IBM has started a three-year project with UCLA to useSystems Network Architecture (SNA) as a backbone for TCP/IP products, headded.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
