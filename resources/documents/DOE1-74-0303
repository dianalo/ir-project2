<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-74-0303 </DOCNO><TEXT>The technique of radiation inactivation has been used on highly purifiedhuman placental insulin receptor in order to determine the functionalmolecular size responsible for the insulin binding and to evaluate theaffinity regulator hypothesis, which has been proposed to explain theincrease in specific insulin binding to rat liver membranes observedat low radiation does. Three different types of inactivation curves wereobserved: (1) biphasic with an enhanced binding activity after exposureto low radiation doses, (2) nonlinear with no change in binding activityafter exposure to low radiation doses, and (3) linear with a loss inthe binding activity with increasing radiation exposures. A monomer-dimermodel was the simplest model that best described the three types of radiationinactivation curves observed. The model predicts that an increase ininsulin binding activity would result after exposure to low radiationdoses when the initial dimer/monomer ratio is equal to or greater than1 and a monomer is more active than a dimer. The monomer size of thebinding activity was estimated to be 227,000 daltons by this model. Tosubstantiate this model, the purified receptor was fractionated by SepharoseCL-6B chromatography. The insulin binding profile of this column indicatedtwo peaks. These studies suggest that the affinity regulator does notexist as a separate structural protein but is due to the dimeric formof the receptor. The dimeric form ({alpha}{sub 2}{beta}{sub 2}) possessesa much lower specific activity for insulin binding than does the monomeric{alpha}{beta} form (under the standard conditions), but the dimeric structureis necessary to observe the negative cooperative binding isotherm.</TEXT></DOC>
