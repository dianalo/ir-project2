For residual bitumens, the importance of the saturated/aromaticand asphaltene/resin ratios, that was foreseen in a previous paper, isconfirmed. A diagram of such ratios shows the presence of five zones:the bitumens falling in each zone give a very similar type of mixture.Such ratios are not sufficient for the oxidized bitumens, for which otherparameters are necessary, for example, the molecular weight or the asphaltenesor the ratio of asphaltene/resin molecular weights.</TEXT></DOC>
