Beregovoy said a second gunboat, or corvette, will be sent tothe region, but he did not say when it would be dispatched.   France had planned to replace one ship with the other, Beregovoysaid in a radio interview. He is finance minister but acting headof government while Prime Minister Michel Rocard is on vacation.   The government decided to leave the first gunboat in place ``andthe one that was supposed to replace it will join it'' in the gulf,Beregovoy told Radio-Television Luxembourg in an interviewbroadcast in France. He did not say when the second ship wouldarrive.   Iraqi troops and tanks swarmed across the border into oil-richKuwait early Thursday, shelling parts of Kuwait city and sendingthe country's leaders fleeing to Saudi Arabia. The U.N. SecurityCouncil denounced the invasion.   ``We must now examine under what conditions the decisions of theUnited Nations can be respected, that is, the immediate withdrawalof Iraqi forces from Kuwait,'' Beregovoy said.   He noted that France acted along with other Western nations infreezing assets of Iraq and Kuwait, the latter mainly to protectthem from seizure by Iraq, and by halting arms sales to Iraq.</TEXT></DOC>
