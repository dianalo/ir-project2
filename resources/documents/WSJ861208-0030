But the exchange or futures brokers couldn't solicit orders from U.S. customers to trade the contract pending the CFTC waiver. The contract is based on 225 of the largest stocks trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.    Exchange and industry officials promote the contract as a hedging vehicle for investors, mainly large institutions, with increasingly big holdings of Japanese stocks.    The Chicago Mercantile Exchange applied earlier this year to trade the Nikkei index future, and expects to receive approval within 12 months, exchange officials said. </TEXT></DOC>
