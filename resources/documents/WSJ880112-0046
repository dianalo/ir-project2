The commission, established to study military strategies for the next century, called on the Defense Department to broaden its focus from its current emphasis on all-out war between the superpowers.    The smaller, but more likely, conflicts that erupt in the developing world &quot;are obviously less threatening than any Soviet-American war would be, yet they have had and will have an adverse cumulative effect on U.S. access to critical regions, on American credibility among allies and friends and on American self-confidence,&quot; the report said.    The commission cited several trends that suggest a waning U.S. influence in much of the developing world: the number of U.S. military officers in friendly Third World countries has declined; the U.S. military trains a third as many personnel in the Third World as it did in 1970 and thus is &quot;losing valuable links to a new generation of military officers&quot; in many countries; and U.S. basing arrangements in the developing world have become &quot;increasingly difficult and politically costly to maintain.&quot;    The commission is headed by Fred Ikle, defense undersecretary, and Albert Wohlstetter, an authority on military strategy. Members include former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brezinski, and retired Army General John Vessey, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.    The critique comes at a time the Pentagon is stumbling in its efforts to establish an organization and a strategy for dealing with guerrilla, or &quot;low-intensity,&quot; conflicts that often erupt in the Third World. A year after Congress enacted legislation to set up a new defense organization to oversee &quot;special operations&quot; units designed to deal with such issues, the Pentagon still lacks an assistant secretary to coordinate the program.    Kenneth Berquist, a Justice Department official nominated for the post, faces opposition in the Congress, where lawmakers doubt his capacity to establish the new organization within a Pentagon bureaucracy that has historically given low-intensity forces short shrift. With Mr. Berquist's prospects for winning Senate confirmation slim, the administration may nominate someone else or may leave the job vacant a while longer.    The commission said that the U.S. should pursue other strategies besides military ones in the Third World. It called on the U.S. to give developing nations more advice on agricultural, medical and economic matters in addition to heftier security assistance.    In time of Third World conflict, the U.S. could make greater use of its technologically advanced systems, the report said. It suggested, for instance, that space surveillance systems could monitor military activities over large areas, and computers could help store data on insurgents and terrorists.    The report said most Third World strategies should take the form of assistance to local military organizations rather than direct military intervention. The commission praised the advisory role taken by the U.S. in El Salvador, where the government is resisting a guerrilla insurgency.    Outside of Third-World conflicts, the commission said it envisioned a military strategy less dependent on massively destructive nuclear weapons and more reliant on sophisticated conventional systems designed to destroy specific targets from long ranges. &quot;By the standards of a decade ago, the accuracies (of current weapons) are extraordinary,&quot; enabling the U.S. to attack enemy bridges or command posts without risking troops or aircraft in the process, the report said.    However, the commission warned that the U.S. no longer enjoys a monopoly on advanced military technology. The Soviet Union, which historically has relied on sheer quantities of weapons, has recently fielded sophisticated systems for penetrating tank armor, as well as submarines that are far quieter than its older ones. Moreover, improved arsenals among lesser powers &quot;will make it riskier and more difficult for the superpowers to intervene in regional wars,&quot; the report concluded. </TEXT></DOC>
