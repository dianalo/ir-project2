In Washington, D.C., the worst thunderstorm in the local powercompany's 93-history tore through the area, felling hundreds oftrees and blacking out scores of thousands of homes. One person wasreported killed in a traffic accident.   An estimated 120,000 to 150,000 customers in Washington andsuburban Maryland were left without power, said Kevin Case,spokesman for Potomac Electric Power Co. Complete restoration wouldtake several days, he said.   A severe thunderstorm west of Decatur, Ala., spawned a tornado,high wind blew a roof off a house south of Hillsboro, trees andpower lines were downed south of Berlin and in Limestone County, androofs were blown away elsewhere.   Another twister touched down in the evening in a rural area aboutfive miles west of Tiffin, Ohio, knocking down a barn, state policesaid.   The storms produced locally heavy rainfall, including more than3.5 inches in 4 hours at Baton Rouge, La.   Showers and thunderstorms had subsided across much of Texas aftera night of heavy rain that pushed creeks out of their banks andflooded roads. Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 7 a.m.CDT, 2.32 inches fell at Longview and 2.18 inches fell at SanAntonio.   Several days of rain and floods have been blamed for three deathsin Texas.   Wednesday brought from one-half to nearly 2 inches of rain to thesouthern tip of Texas, the best general rain since Hurricane Gilbertlast September, said Doyle Warren, a regional extension worker atWeslaco. April and May each normally bring 4 to 5 inches ofrainfall, but this year April brought less than 2 inches, and therewas ``nothing in May,'' he said.   The combination of cold air aloft and a low pressure system oversouthern Wisconsin produced showers across sections of that state,and produced unusual ``cold air funnel clouds,'' the weather servicesaid. The short-lived cousins of tornadoes formed near the center ofthe low pressure system and touched down briefly in the Madison,damaging automobiles at Madison and a barn in a nearby town.   Showers and thunderstorms, some producing heavy rain, also werescattered over the southern and central Appalachians and the OhioValley. During the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, Youngstown, Ohio, got1.94 inches of rain.   Elsewhere, showers were scattered ahead of a cold front over thePacific Northwest.   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 45degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 108 at Needles, Calif. Wednesday'slow in the 48 contiguous states was 30 at South Lake Tahoe, Calif.   For Thursday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecastfrom the northern and middle Atlantic Coast across the Great Lakes,the Ohio and Tennessee valleys to the central and western GulfCoast. Scattered showers and a few thunderstorms were forecastacross the Pacific Northwest.   Highs in the 60s were predicted from much of the upper and middleMississippi Valley across the Great Lakes and the northern half ofthe lower Ohio Valley into New England, and along the northern andcentral Pacific Coast; in the 90s from the southern Atlantic Coaststates into Florida, and from southwestern Texas into inlandCalifornia; above 100 over the desert Southwest, inland valleys ofsouthern California, and near the Big Bend of the Rio Grande inTexas; and in the 70s and 80s over the remainder of the nation.</TEXT></DOC>
