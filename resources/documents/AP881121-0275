In an interview on state-run television, Nazer said the Saudi oilindustry wants to compete in United States, European and Japanesemarkets through joint ventures with foreign oil concerns.   Analysts have said other OPEC countries also are looking forsimilar ``downstream'' ventures to help offset thecounter-cyclicality of production and refining. Falling crude priceshave been a boon to many U.S. refiners, while hurting productionoperations.   The Saudi Arabian National Oil Company, which runs the kingdom'soil industry, recently launched a joint venture with Texaco Inc. torefine and market petroleum in the United States.   ``The American market is big and there is still more to it, whilethere is the very big market in Japan and Europe and Far East, andwe as processors of oil must storm these markets and... guaranteemarketing outlets for Saudi crude oil,'' Nazer said in theinterview, broadcast Sunday.   Nazer also mentioned plans for similar deals in European andJapanese markets, noting that prices of refined products remainsteady despite fluctuating crude prices.   ``In case the price of crude oil drops, the income would becompensated somewhat through preserving the price levels of refinedproducts,'' he said.   Declining oil prices since 1982 have meant six straight years ofbudget deficits in Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer among the 13Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Saudi Arabia has theworld's largest oil reserves.   The current world oil glut has forced prices down to about $13 abarrel, well below the OPEC benchmark price of $18.   Nazer said the kingdom's oil development strategy ``would belacking if it did not comprise all stages of the industry startingfrom the wellhead and ending with the gasoline station.''   The Texaco deal gave the kingdom a 50 percent stake in threeTexaco refineries and nearly 12,000 service stations in the UnitedStates. It was the first major Saudi attempt to guarantee outletsfor its crude oil.   Nazer said in the television interview that the deal guaranteedsales of 600,000 barrels per day. Saudi Arabia's current OPECproduction quota is 4.34 million barrels per day.   Revamping the Saudi oil industry also includes measures toimprove profits at the state-run refining and marketing companyPetrofin, Nazer said. Petrofin controls all but one of the kingdom'ssix oil refineries, operates three lubricants plants and distributesand exports refined products.   Petrofin also controls exploration and development of non-oilmineral resources such as bauxite, the raw material for aluminum,and gold.   ``The aim is to convert all of Petrofin's tasks to profit centersthat bring additional revenue to the state and then to reduce theexpenditure costs in Petromin,'' Nazer said. He said savings of 500million riyals ($133 million) already have been made.</TEXT></DOC>
