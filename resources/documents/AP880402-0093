Riot police fired multiple tear gas launchers at about 500students from a dozen Seoul universities when they tried to marchout of Yonsei University after a pro-labor rally. Studentsimmediately streamed out of the campus and battled riot police forseveral hours.   No serious injuries or arrests were reported.   During the rally, student leaders denounced the government ofPresident Roh Tae-woo as just another authoritarian regime. Theyhad gathered to show support for workers who want higher wages andmore independent unions.   Labor disputes have increased sharply since Roh took office Feb.25, as have protests by anti-government students.   Since his election in December, Roh has promised to better thelot of workers. But his government has also vowed to deal harshlywith violent protests to ensure the country's stability and steadyeconomic development.   Violent labor protests battered many South Korean companies lastsummer following widespread protests that led former President ChunDoo-hwan to agree to democratic reforms.   Those reforms included the direct elections in which Roh waschosen without having won a majority when two rival oppositioncandidates split the anti-government vote.</TEXT></DOC>
