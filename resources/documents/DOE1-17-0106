Although echocardiographyand radionuclide ventriculography provide similar information, magneticresonance is in its infancy and many future improvements can be expected.For instance, machines will become cheaper and more widely availableand scanning will become more rapid. A real time three-dimensional displayof the heart is a realistic prospect. Its unique role, however, willbe in the study of biochemistry and blood flow. The combination of thesestudies with non-invasive coronary arteriography will provide magneticresonance with an important place in the future management of cardiovasculardisease.</TEXT></DOC>
