America First Financial Corp., San Francisco, acquired insolvent Stanford Savings andamp; Loan Association of Palo Alto, Calif., with $7.6 million of cash assistance. The thrift had assets of $76.5 million. The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. also indemnified America First against losses on Stanford Savings' troubled assets, and received a $2.5 million issue of zero-coupon preferred stock in Eureka Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, which is a unit of America First.    America First, which manages a $120 million limited partnership fund that was set up to acquire failed thrifts and banks, took over Eureka, with about $2 billion in assets, last month. The two top officers of America First, Stephen T. McLin and Mariann Byerwalter, are both graduates of Stanford University.    Stanford Savings isn't affiliated with Stanford University, but the thrift's single office is located near the university campus. &quot;It's a great name,&quot; said Mr. McLin, a former BankAmerica Corp. executive.    Separately, Golden West Financial Corp., an Oakland, Calif.-based thrift holding company with $13.7 billion in assets, expanded into the state of Washington by acquiring Lynnwood Savings andamp; Loan Association of Lynnwood, Wash., a Seattle suburb, with $6.1 million of FSLIC assistance.    Lynnwood Savings, which will become part of World Savings andamp; Loan Association, Golden West's main operating unit, had assets of $24.6 million.    The two assisted acquisitions bring to 43 the number of failed thrifts that the FSLIC has resolved this year. Twenty-nine of those thrifts have been acquired or merged with FSLIC assistance. </TEXT></DOC>
