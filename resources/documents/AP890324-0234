The nervousness reflects a growing fear that internationaltensions will destroy the market's 26-year-old price-support systemand allow free-market forces to prevail, with lower prices thelikely result.   Concerns about that prospect took center stage at New York'sCoffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange during the past week and are likelyto intensify as representatives from the world's largestcoffee-producing and coffee-consuming nations prepare for a 2-weekconference in London.   The April 4-19 meeting is the last regularly scheduled gatheringof the International Coffee Organization council before Sept. 30,when the organization's 6-year price-support agreement expires.   Delegates of the 74-nation group last met in February and madenegligible progress on addressing consumer-nation demands aimed atincreasing the availability of mild coffees, the type preferred bygrowing numbers of coffee drinkers.   Mild coffees are grown mainly in Central and South America whilethe less-flavorful robusta coffees are produced primarily in Africa.   The failure of the February session prompted heavy selling ofcoffee futures in New York, dropping the price for May deliverybelow $1.23 a pound on Feb. 21, just 7 weeks after the contract hadtraded at a 2-year of nearly $1.60 a pound.   A weak recovery pushed the May contract back up above $1.35 byMarch 17 but prices tumbled again in the past week as pre-meetingjitters gripped the market. Coffee for May delivery plunged below$1.27 by Wednesday and finished the week Thursday at $1.2859 apound. The market was closed on Friday.   ``I think perhaps the market was overcome by pessimismsurrounding the ICO conference in London,'' said Arthur Stevenson,an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. ``Itdoes not look like the two sides have really come a long way interms of bridging their differences.''   The United Nations helped create the International CoffeeOrganization in 1963 after coffee-producing nations had tried andfailed for many years to control coffee prices through self-imposedexport quotas and stockpiling.   The International Coffee Organization's price-control system alsohinges on export quotas designed to keep prices within a range,currently $1.20 to $1.40 a pound. The organization's consumermembers agree to observe the price floor and to limit theirpurchases of coffee from non-ICO producers.   The main issue facing delegates to next month's meeting is ademand by consumer nations, of which the United States is thelargest, that the quota system be revamped to increase theproportion of mild coffees to less-flavorful robusta coffees in theoverall export mix.   The producer nations, of which Brazil is the largest, object tothat demand on the grounds that growers of robusta coffees needprotection in the face of steadily declining coffee consumption.   According to the International Coffee Organization, per capitacoffee consumption in the United States fell to 1.67 cups a day in1988 from 3.12 cups a day in 1962. The percentage of coffee drinkersin the U.S. population dropped to 50 percent from nearly 75 percentduring the same period.   So fiercely have the two sides clung to their positions that boththe United States and Brazil have threatened in previous meetings todrop out of the International Coffee Organization at the end of thecurrent agreement. Analysts say the organization could not survivewithout the participation of both countries.   ``With an agreement (on quotas) we hold these price levels,''said Bert Ruiz, a coffee broker with Balfour Maclaine Corp.``Without an agreement, we're going downtown.''
