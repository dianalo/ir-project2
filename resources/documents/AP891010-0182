The court let stand a successful lawsuit against the protestersby the operators of an abortion clinic in that city.   Similar lawsuits, each invoking the Racketeering Influenced andCorrupt Organizations Act (RICO), have been filed against``pro-life'' activists in cities such as Pittsburgh, Chicago andBrookline, Mass.   Using the federal law lets those who win suits collect threetimes whatever financial damages they prove, a feature notavailable in many suits filed under state law. In the Philadelphiacase, the clinic operators were awarded about $2,600 in tripledRICO damages.   In a series of past rulings, the Supreme Court has permittedbroad use of the law _ allowing lawsuits by anyone whose propertyor business is harmed by a ``pattern'' of illegal activities.   The litigation strategy has proved troubling to some abortionrights advocates, who fear that political protesters will belabeled ``racketeers'' and held financially liable for nothing morethan expressing their views.   For example, American Civil Liberties Union lawyer AntonioCalifa recently wrote: ``The ACLU believes that civil RICO'spotential for chilling First Amendment rights of expression isenormous.''   But in upholding a $108,000 award against the 26 Philadelphiaprotesters last March, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals saidtheir actions ``went beyond ... constitutional rights of speech andprotest.''   The tripled damages under RICO formed only a small part of thetotal damages. Of the $108,000, $65,000 went to attorney's fees andmore than $40,000 went to the clinic as non-RICO damages.   The protesters on four occasions from 1984 to 1986 unlawfullyentered the Northeast Women's Center in Philadelphia. According totrial testimony, protesters threw medical supplies on the floor,damaged equipment, assaulted the clinic's employees and harassedpatients.   Tuesday's action does not preclude the nation's highest courtfrom granting review in some future case in which more peaceableanti-abortion demonstrators are sued under the racketeering law.   ``This is one battle in a long war,'' said Michael McMonagle,one of the 26 Philadelphia protesters and executive director of thePro-Life Coalition of Southeast Pennsylvania.   ``We intend to continue our efforts to non-violently savechildren and mothers from abortion at the abortion facilities. Thiscase will not deter that one bit,'' McMonagle said.   Edmond A. Tiryak, the abortion clinic's lawyer, said the SupremeCourt action ``shows that our society will not tolerate the use offear and intimidation by religious fanatics to impose their will onwomen seeking abortion services.''   In their appeal, the 26 protesters decried ``an unprecedentedand dangerous expansion of'' the federal law primarily aimed atfighting organized crime. They said the law was being used tostifle political expression.   ``Under the 3rd Circuit's interpretations of RICO ... MartinLuther King was a racketeer when he trespassed on private propertyand conspired with others in an attempt to change the businesspolicies of owners of segregated lunch counters,'' the appealcontended.   ``So, too, is anyone participating in a sit-in against apartheidwith the goal of changing the investment policies of auniversity,'' the appeal said, arguing that no RICO violationshould be found if no economic profit motive exists.   Only Justice Byron R. White, who cited a split among federalappeals courts over the for-profit requirement in RICO cases, votedto study the Philadelphia protesters' appeal. The votes of fourjustices are needed to grant such review.   In other action, the court:   _Agreed to use a Missouri case to clarify when sentencing judgesmay hand down extra prison time for habitual criminals.   _Said it will decide in a Texas case what retroactive effect togive its ruling last June that allowed states to execute mentallyretarded killers if jurors are allowed to take into account thedefendant's mental state.   _Agreed to resolve a dispute in the federal prosecution of ninePuerto Rico men accused of robbing $7.2 million from a Wells Fargodepot in Connecticut six years ago.   _Set aside a $1,000 fine against an Easton, Pa., newspaper forpublishing a bookmaker's telephone conversations that were tappedby police.   _Agreed to referee a battle over patent rights for medicaldevices, granting an appeal by Eli Lilly and Co. that seeksreinstatement of a $26.7 million award won, and then lost, againsta competitor.</TEXT></DOC>
