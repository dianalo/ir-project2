The Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population andDevelopment report, based on data compiled by the United Nations,said the population of Asia hit the 3 billion mark at 0047Greenwhich Mean Time Wednesday.   Asia, the world's most populous region, accounts for 60 percentof the global total, which passed the 5 billion mark in July 1987.Seven babies are born in Asia every second _ or 150,000 each day _the report said.   The forum, headed by Takashi Sato, Japan's Agriculture Minister,issued the report at an international conference in Tokyo lastmonth heralding the Day of the Three Billion. The forum groups 19Asian nations from Australia to Syria.   ``The designation of a day marking the birth of the 3 billionthbaby in Asia is very symbolic,'' said Shigemi Kono, directorgeneral of the National Institute of Population Problems. ``But Ipersonally think it is nonsense, because there is no way ofactually knowing when the 3 billionth baby was born.''   Skepticism about calculations aside, however, Kono agrees thereare serious population problems in the region.   ``Though we have come close to solving the fertility rateproblem in Japan and China, serious questions remain in India,Bangladesh and Pakistan,'' he said.   India, with a population of 818 million, has an annual growthrate of 2.08 percent. Pakistan, with a population of 115 million,has a 3.45-percent growth rate and Bangladesh, with 110 millionpeople, has 2.67 percent, according to United Nations estimates.   By the year 2025, Asia will have 4.5 billion inhabitants, saidan official with the non-profit, Tokyo-based Asian Population andDevelopment Association. The estimated growth in Asia is roughlyequal to the increase in the total world population from 1950 to1980, she added, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Experts have predicted that rice production will have toincrease 50 percent by 2025 to feed the continent.</TEXT></DOC>
