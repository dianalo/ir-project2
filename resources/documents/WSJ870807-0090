The banks acted after the Bank of England unexpectedly raised its money market dealing rates one point to 9 7/8%. The abrupt change in base rates, which are the benchmark for commercial lending in Britain, rattled investors, sending prices plunging on London's stock exchange.    The 100-share index was down as much as 70 points at one point and ended down a record 56 points at 2261.4. The Financial Times 30-share index plummeted 42.5 points to 1754.1.    The decline was so widespread that only six issues in the 100-share index didn't fall.    Volume expanded to 832.3 million shares from 605.8 million Wednesday.    The largest previous one-day fall for the 100-share index was on March 30, when it dropped 46.1 to 2002.5.    The plunge yesterday was mostly the result of market-makers setting their prices lower rather than heavy selling, brokers said. But one broker said many institutions would have liked to sell, but market-makers weren't answering their phones for the hour and a half when prices approached their low point, because they wanted to get prices down before buying new stock.    Barclays and Midland Bank raised their base rates first, around midday. Others followed during a turbulent afternoon in the London's financial markets. The interest rate increases, which take effect today, reverse four consecutive reductions earlier this year, which trimmed base rates to 9% from 11% between March and May.    The increase in rates was so unexpected that just two days ago, Halifax Building Society, Britain's biggest, lowered its mortgage interest rate to 10.8% from 11.25%. Building societies are the United Kingdom equivalent of U.S. savings and loan associations.    Central bank officials attributed the rate increase to concern over rapid money supply growth. However, some economists questioned whether that fear was the real motive.    &quot;The facts just don't square with the official statements. The Bank of England must know something the market doesn't,&quot; said Keith Skeoch, chief economist at the stockbrokerage James Capel andamp; Co.    Many analysts viewed the central bank's action as an attempt to head off anticipated negative market reaction to some key economic indicators scheduled to be released next week. The timing of the base rate rise &quot;suggests that next Tuesday's figures on foreign trade and Friday's data on retail prices will be a lot worse than expected,&quot; said Malcolm Roberts, a Salomon Brothers economist based here.    Mr. Roberts said investors &quot;have been anxiously awaiting the upcoming foreign trade figure for June&quot; because Britain's current-account balance of payments abruptly swung to a #561 million ($886.4 million) deficit in May. The deficit slashed the #762 million surplus accumulated over the previous four months.    May's trade figure had a great impact &quot;because the large, broadly based rise in imports suggested the period of self-sustaining, low-inflation growth in the U.K. was coming to an end,&quot; Mr. Roberts said.    Financial markets received another jolt last week when May's seasonally adjusted bank lending to the private sector surged to #3.9 billion, well above the previous monthly average of #2.7 billion. The indicator is viewed as an important gauge of inflationary pressures.    Prices of U.K. government bonds, or gilts, plunged as much as three points yesterday on news of the rate increases.    Yields for gilts have risen sharply in recent months, another measure of renewed inflationary concern. Gilt yields increased to about 9.98% late yesterday, up from 9.1% on July 22, when May's foreign trade figure was announced, and 8.6% on June 12, the day after Britain's general election.    A number of economists argue that surging consumer demand has outstripped U.K. industrial production capacity and now only can be accommodated by higher imports. However, rising imports threaten to worsen Britain's trade balance, eat into domestic growth and ultimately increase pressure on the value of the pound.    The decline in stock prices was across the board, but shares of builders were hit particularly hard because higher rates usually lead to lower demand for new houses. Tarmac was down 17 pence at 294 pence ($4.65), and BPB Industries tumbled 13 pence to 382 pence.    In the banking sector, Barclays was down six pence at 589 pence, Midland fell 10 pence to 625 pence, Lloyds declined 14 pence to 357 pence and National Westminster Bank was off five pence at 705 pence.    Tokyo, Frankfurt Stocks   Stock prices in Tokyo surged as domestic-demand issues rallied after a recovery in the Japanese government bond market.    The Nikkei stock average jumped 361.08 points to 24658.23. Turnover increased to 600 million shares from 500 million shares Wednesday. Gainers outnumbered losers, 645 to 242.    Traders said Japanese stocks rebounded for the second consecutive day as investors were encouraged by a price recovery on the domestic bond market and the advance in stock prices in New York Wednesday.    There was a strong rally in domestic-incentive issues, particularly construction, housing and real estate shares.    In Frankfurt, prices were generally higher in response to gains in the dollar, dealers said.    There was a resurgence in domestic institutional activity amid continued strong foreign buying, especially by the Japanese, brokers said. Some profit-taking late in the session took shares off of their highest levels of the session.    The dollar appears to have left its lowest levels against the mark behind it, which could lift profitability of West German exporters, an analyst at Dresdner Bank said.
