A spokesman for Daimler-Benz, Friedrich Loesch, denied thatexport rules were broken, saying the trucks were ``multi-usevehicles'' not specifically designed for military purposes. However,he said they could be used by the Pakistan military.   Der Spiegel magazine said that Daimler-Benz had sold Pakistan 237trucks and 30 tractor-trailers from November 1986 through November1987.   The magazine said that customs officials in Cologne determinedthat the vehicles were shipped to the Pakistan army without arequired export license.   Der Spiegel said the shipments were not inspected by customsofficials because they were registered as civilian vehicles. Customsofficials later determined that the shipments were to be used formilitary purposes, the magazine said.   Loesch said the company had complied with all export licenserequirements.   ``These vehicles came out of mass production lines and can beused for all kinds of transport, including military,'' Loesch saidin a radio interview.   He said the company cannot tell the buyers how to use thevehicles.   In the radio interview, Loesch said he did not know whether thecompany had negotiated the sales directly with military officials inPakistan.   But he confirmed as correct the number of vehicles mentioned inthe Spiegel report.   Export permits are required for the shipment of militaryequipment or hazardous materials to areas of tension.   Stuttgart-based Daimler-Benz is also a major exporter of luxurycars.</TEXT></DOC>
