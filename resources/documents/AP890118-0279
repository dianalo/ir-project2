The Commerce Department said the gap between what the UnitedStates imports and what it sells overseas was 21.9 percent higherthan the October deficit of $10.3 billion.   The sharply higher deficit was blamed on a big jump in imports,which shot up to $39.7 billion, $1.6 billion above the Octoberlevel. Exports, which have been booming this year, declined by $639million to $27.2 billion.   The November deficit was the largest since a $13.2 billionimbalance in June.   In the past, a sharp worsening of the nation's trade performancehas sent shock waves through financial markets. However, today'sreport had less of an impact.   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks edged down by morethan 6 points in early trading but gainers slightly outnumberedlosers in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listedissues.   ``The markets took this trade number in stride and went on,''said Jay Goldinger, chief economist of Capital Insight, a BeverlyHills, Calif., investment firm.   However, economists said the big jump in the November deficitshowed that the country has a long way to go before its tradedifficulties are over.   ``We have a serious competitiveness problem in this country,''said Lawrence Chimerine, head of the Wefa Group, an economicconsulting firm. ``There's a limit to how much you can improve bycutting costs and driving the dollar lower.''   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``It is truethere is a slight jump this month, and that is always of concern,but it does fly in the face of a trend that is going down and in theright direction, and we trust that this is an aberration and doesnot change the overall trend.''   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity termed the report``disappointing. While our exports remain strong, the robustdomestic economy continues to draw in imports at near-record levelsand the trade deficit remains too high.''   Verity said that while the trade deficit was running 20 percentbelow the all-time high set in 1987, the improvement has leveled offin recent months.   ``All of this means that we have a long way to go,'' he said in astatement. ``We must continue to improve our efficiency and qualityat home and pursue our efforts to reduce trade barriers abroad.''   In other economic reports today, the Federal Reserve said thatthe operating rate at U.C. factories, mines and utilities rose inDecember to 84.2 percent, the highest rate in nine years.   Even with the November deterioration, the trade deficit for thefirst 11 months of 1988 was running at an annual rate of $137.3billion, almost 20 percent below the all-time imbalance of $170.3billion set in 1987.   This big improvement in trade has been largely responsible forthe overall prosperity the country enjoyed last year. But analystshave begun to worry that the trade improvement, which was powered bya surge in export sales, is in danger of stalling out this year.   If that occurs, it raises the threat that the new Bushadministration will have to deal with a possible recession, or atthe very least that the new president will be faced with growingcries to erect new trade barriers to protect American manufacturers.   ``This is curtains for any hope that we are going to get thetrade deficit under control any time soon,'' said Michael Evans,head of a Washington economic forecasting firm.   Many economists believe that the U.S. dollar will have to fallfurther to spur further sales of American exports. But the Bushadministration is worried that sharp declines in the dollar couldworsen U.S. inflation by increasing the cost of imports.   For November, the 4.2 percent rise in imports reflected bigincreases in imports of business capital equipment, which rose by$1.1 billion, and consumer goods other than autos, which climbed by$697 million.   The rise in capital goods reflected increases in U.S. purchasesof iron and steel products, airplanes and heavy equipment such asmetal working machinery.   American industry has been rushing to expand and modernizeproduction facilities to meet increased demand. However, much of theexpansion has come through the purchase of foreign capital equipment.   The auto category actually dropped by $229 million duringNovember. The nation's foreign oil bill fell a slight 0.4 percent to$3.13 billion, reflecting a drop in both the amount of oil importedand the price, which fell to an average price of $13.38 per barrel.   The 2.3 percent drop in exports in November reflected declines insales of U.S. farm products and capital goods.   By country, the deficit with Japan was the largest, a $5.3billion imbalance, followed by a $2 billion deficit with WesternEurope.   The overall trade figures are adjusted to reflect normal seasonalvariations. The deficits with individual countries are not.   Evans said he expected the deficit would be frozen at the currenthigh levels for all of 1989 as the demand for foreign goods on thepart of American consumers shows little sign of slacking despite thehigher prices.   ``This is curtains for any hope that we are going to get thetrade deficit under control anytime soon,'' he said.   Data Resources Inc., another consulting firm, is also predictinglittle progress on the trade front this year based on a belief thathigher prices for imported goods will largely offset further gainsin export sales.   The Reagan administration launched an effort in September 1985 todrive the value of the dollar lower to make American goods morecompetitive on overseas markets.   The effort took far longer to show results than many had expectedand has yet to dampen the steady increase in imports even though theproducts now cost more.</TEXT></DOC>
