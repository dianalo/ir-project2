Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   George Bush may have won a glorious victory Tuesday. But The Wall Street Journal's regular panel of political experts predicts mostly gloom and doom for him in the weeks and months ahead.    Even before Mr. Bush takes office, says John Sears, the Republican analyst, &quot;His appointments may cause big problems. The fact is, a lot of Republicans don't trust their man.&quot; At some point, says Mr. Sears, conservative Republicans in the Congress &quot;are going to go after him.&quot;    &quot;George Bush's lack of a mandate is an enormous problem,&quot; says Kevin Phillips, the GOP theoretician. Worse, he figures Mr. Bush will be in the White House &quot;when the chickens finally come home to roost&quot; and the economy falters.    The Democrats chime in with gloomy views of their own.    &quot;Bush's negatives never dropped during the campaign,&quot; poll taker Peter Hart says. &quot;The fundamental problem -- a sense that he lacks qualities of leadership -- is going to revisit him.&quot;    &quot;No matter how good George Bush is,&quot; says political analyst Alan Baron, who doesn't expect him to be all that good, &quot;Ronald Reagan will always look better.&quot;    The panelists all point out that while Mr. Bush was winning a decisive presidential election victory, the Democrats were building on their already imposing strength in Congress and in state governments. The result, they say, is that it will be difficult if not impossible for Mr. Bush to make an early mark in domestic affairs.    And so, says Mr. Sears, almost surely Mr. Bush &quot;will call a meeting with the Russians and try to get something positive going before he's hit with all these other troubles. He'll make deals with the Russians, and that will be popular&quot; with most Americans but will probably give right-wing Republicans more reason to distrust him.    The four panelists met with Journal reporters and editors yesterday to analyze the election and to take a look at what a Bush administration may turn out to be. Their other observations included these:   --Democrat Michael Dukakis blew the election (with a demurrer from Mr. Baron, who doubted it was in the cards for the Massachusetts governor to win under any circumstances).    --The Republican coalition that gave Ronald Reagan two landslide victories is beginning to fragment and is based too heavily on the Deep South.    --The first signs of a new -- and maybe winning -- Democratic strategy are beginning to emerge, but the Democrats so far don't seem to be smart enough to recognize it.    &quot;This was an election Michael Dukakis lost,&quot; says Mr. Sears. &quot;His campaign never forced George Bush to stand up and be loyal to Ronald Reagan.&quot; Mr. Sears envisions an ad he says the Democrats could and should have used, taking the administration to task for accepting a nation in which homeless men and women sleep on grates.    &quot;Dukakis ran a terrible campaign,&quot; says Mr. Sears.    When the campaign began, says Mr. Phillips, &quot;the Democrats were in pretty good shape.&quot; He puts three-quarters of the blame for their defeat directly on Mr. Dukakis, mostly because he didn't respond to attacks by Mr. Bush and because he didn't try to spell out to the American people what kind of man he really is.    &quot;You learn about people in part through symbols,&quot; says Mr. Hart. &quot;The only thing people ever learned about Dukakis was his old snow blower,&quot; which was meant to demonstrate his frugality.    Mr. Baron disagrees. To win, he says, the Democrats needed &quot;a better candidate, a better campaign and a better environment.&quot; Democrats probably won't win, he suggests, until the economy turns sour for the Republicans.    But, the other panelists say, the Democrats can't just sit around waiting for the Republicans to stumble. They need a strategy, and these analysts think they see one beginning to emerge.    Nobody seems to be noticing, Mr. Hart says, but the Democrats are gaining strength in unlikely places such as Vermont, Wisconsin, the Dakotas, Iowa, Montana, Washington, Oregon and California. &quot;That,&quot; he says, &quot;is the silver lining.&quot;    Mr. Phillips, the theoretician and an expert in coalitions, agrees. &quot;You can see the outline,&quot; he says. &quot;It starts in the Northeast and includes key states like Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, Arkansas, Tennessee and Missouri.&quot;    One caution, according to Mr. Sears: The strategy won't work if the Democrats keep nominating liberals as presidential candidates.    Mr. Hart agrees, noting that the Democrats picked up only one-third of the white Protestant vote Tuesday -- although that was an improvement from four years ago. &quot;White Protestants make up 48% of the votes,&quot; says Mr. Hart.    The panelists generally discounted speculation that the Democrats, in the wake of their defeat, will plunge into a bloodbath, with the Rev. Jesse Jackson fomenting the discontent. &quot;That's been overestimated,&quot; says Mr. Baron. &quot;Blacks are fully pragmatic.&quot; He says they rallied around Mr. Jackson this year because none of the other candidates appealed to them. &quot;I don't see any underlying divisions,&quot; he says.    Mr. Phillips argues that Mr. Jackson helps the Democrats by constantly reminding them they are the grass-roots party of Andrew Jackson and Franklin Roosevelt.    One thing the Democrats should do, the panelists generally agree, is to set out more forcefully in Congress to be a true opposition party, forcing the Republicans to make the tough choices.    The panelists say a window of opportunity may be opening for the Democrats as the Republican coalition begins to erode. &quot;The South has become the major fulcrum of the Republican coalition,&quot; says Mr. Phillips. And as that becomes more apparent, he says, &quot;other parts of the country are moving toward the exit signs.&quot;    Mr. Bush's strategists understand this phenomenon, they say, but aren't sure what Mr. Bush can do about it. So far, they also say, the Democrats have failed to grasp it.    Another Republican problem is the future of conservative leadership in the Republican Party, which now seems to have been deeded to Dan Quayle, the vice president-elect. None of the sages thinks much of the conservative young senator's future.    &quot;It's just unbelievable,&quot; says Mr. Phillips. &quot;People are trying to figure out what countries he can safely be sent to for funerals.&quot;    It was pointed out that Richard Nixon rehabilitated himself as vice president. But Mr. Sears, who worked for former President Nixon years ago, doesn't see any parallel, saying of his former boss: &quot;He sure doesn't remind me of Dan Quayle.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
