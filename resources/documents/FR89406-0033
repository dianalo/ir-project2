The petitionersand respondents requested in accordance with andSection; 353.53a(a) of theCommerce Regulations that we conduct these administrative reviews. We havenow completed these administrative reviews in accordance with section 751of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``the Tariff Act''). NEC Corporation (``NEC'') failed to respond to our sales questionnairefor the ninth review period. Therefore, we used NEC's most recent rateas the best information available for appraisement and cash deposit purposes.We verified in Japan and in the United States the questionnaire responsesfor certain periods submitted by Matsushita Electric industrial Company,Ltd. (``Matsushita'') and Victor Company of Japan (``Victor''). In accordancewith section 776(b) of the Tariff Act we verified the information usedin making our preliminary determination. We used standard verificationprocedures including examination of relevant accounting records and originalsource documents. <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of the Review </ITAG>Imports convered by the review are shipments of television receiving sets,monochrome and color, and include but are not limited to projection televisions,receiver monitors, and kits (containing all the parts necessary to receivea broadcast television signal and produce a video image). Not includedare certain monitors not capable of receiving a broadcast signal, certaincombination units, and certain subassemblies not containing the componentsessential for receiving a broadcast television signal and producing a videoimage. The review covers five manufacturers and/or exporters of Japanese televisionreceivers, monochrome and color, and various periods from April 1, 1981through February 29, 1988. All reviewed periods are identified in the FinalResults of Review. <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments Received </ITAG>We invited interested parties to comment on the preliminary results. Atthe request of three repsondents, we held an administrative hearing onJanuary 27, 1989. We received comments from a party to the proceeding,Zenith, and three respondents, Matsushita, Toshiba Corporation (``Toshiba''),and Victor. The Department notes that it had difficulties running the computerprograms for Matsushita's third and fourth period reviews due to the qualityand volume of data involved. In this final determination we have correctedthe following inadvertent programming errors in our calculations: failureto make certain currency conversions, computer-generated missing values,incorrect programming statements which omitted differences-in-merchandiseclaims (third review), and waranty and indirect selling expense claims(fourth review). In addition, certain comments by Zenith and the respondentsconcerned mathematical or clerical errors. In this final determinationwe have corrected the following such errors: incorrect consumer sales divisionexpense amounts (Matsushita's third and fourth reviews), incorrect standarddiscount claimed amounts for one model (Matsushita's fourth review), deductingtwice certain home market indirect CTV warranty expenses (Matsushita'sfourth review), deducting twice certain home market selling expenses (portionsof advertising, sales promotion, warranty, and technical services) (Matsushita'sthird and fourth reviews), omission of adjustments for U.S. credit expensesfor one Matsushita U.S. subsidiary (Matsushita's partial fifth review),omission of adjustments for advertising expenses in the CV calculations(Matsushita's eighth review), and omission of adjustments for home marketwarranty parts expenses (Victor's fifth and eighth reviews). <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Zenith's Comments </ITAG><T3>Comment 1: </T3>Zenith argues that in its preliminary results the Departmentimproperly adjusted for commodity taxes because of the Department's failureto limit the addition to U.S. price (USP) to the amount of tax includedin the home market model. Zenith contends that regardless of whether theDepartment assumes that such taxes are fully passed through to the customer,the law requires the Department to add no more commodity tax to the U.S.price than is included in the home market price. Zenith further contends that the Department's circumstance-of-sale adjustmentfor differences in commodity taxes is unlawful because in its <T3>Zenith Electronics Corp. </T3>v. <T3>The United States </T3>decision the Court of International Trade (CIT)prohibited the Department from making such an adjustment. Zenith contendsthat the statute does not require tax neutrality in all cases, and thatthe Department has no authority to ``nullify the tax adjustment.'' Finally,Zenith contends that Congress acquiesced to the CIT's decision by not amendingthe statute to authorize the direct removal of commodity taxes from thehome market price without consideration of tax pass-through. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. Section 772(d)(1)(C) of thestatute provides for an adjustment to USP to ``the extent that such taxesare added to or included in'' the home market price. The statute does notrequire the Department to ``cap'' the adjustment by the absolute amountof tax added to or included in the home market price. Moreover, as we have noted previously, the CIT's earlier pronouncementconcerning the Department's treatment of differences between USP and foreignmarket value (FMV) was <T3>dicta. </T3>The commodity tax circumstance-of-sale issue was not beforethe CIT in Zenith. Even assuming <T3>arguendo </T3>that the CIT decided the issue in Zenith, the Departmentwould still not be bound to follow it in this review, since the Departmentis not bound by decisions of the court with which it does not agree andwhich it plans to appeal. We also take issue with Zenith's assertion thatCongress has acquiesced to the Zenith decision. There is no evidence onthe record that Congress foresaw the ``multiplier effect'' by which marginscan be created exclusively due to the fact that more commodity tax is attributableto a foreign model than to a U.S. model. The commodity tax circumstance-of-saleadjustment is necessary to avoid artificially inflating or deflating margins.Moreover, the adjustment is mandated by GATT, and consistent with pastdepartmental practice.<T3>Comment 2: </T3>Zenith argues that the Department failed to accountfor interest income earned on home market sales activity (e.g., discounts,rebates, sales promotion). Zenith contends that the Department should reduceeach of these claims by the savings that respondents earn by paying theclaimed amount at some time after the obligations were incurred.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. The Department has addressedthis issue in past reviews of this case. (See Television Receivers, Monochromeand Color from Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Duty AdministrativeReview (53 FR 4050, February 11, 1988).) In these circumstances, the Departmentavoids imputing expenses/costs where a company quantifies the actual expenses/costs,provides adequate documentation of these expenses, and the company's quantificationaccurately reflects the expense to the seller.<T3>Comment 3: </T3>Zenith contends that respondents should not have includedcertain non-selling general and administrative expenses in their calculationof the exporter's sales price (ESP) offset. Zenith argues that the Departmentshould require affirmative demonstrations that each indirect expense claimedas part of an offset to FMV is an indirect selling expense. Zenith assertsthat since respondents have multiple profit centers in the home marketthey have the ability to transfer costs and expenses to whichever profitcenter serves their purpose.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. The pool of indirect sellingexpenses in the home market should include those expenses which are similarto the expenses incurred by the subsidiary in the U.S., whose functionit is to sell merchandise (see our position on Comment 2 in the Final Resultsof Antidumping Duty Administrative Review; Color Television Receivers fromKorea, 53 FR 24975, July 1, 1988). As we have stated elsewhere, we do notinterpret andSection; 353.15 of our regulations concerning indirect sellingexpenses in the home market as limited only to selling expenses in salesoffices, and as excluding so-called non-selling expenses incurred by thoseoffices. The respondents provided adequate documentation supporting theiroffset claims. Certain of the expenses are general expenses associatedwith selling; respondents, therefore, correctly included these expensesin their calculation of indirect selling expenses.<T3>Comment 4: </T3>Zenith argues that the Department should have deductedantidumping legal expenses from ESP.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. It is our practice, as statedin our Study of Antidumping Adjustments Methodology and Recommendationsfor Statutory Change (November 1985), not to consider legal fees paid inconnection with litigation resulting from an earlier antidumping investigationto be an expense related to sales made in the period being reviewed. (Seealso the final results of sales at less than fair value on Certain SteelPipes and Tubes from Japan, 48 FR 1206, April 29, 1983.) We view legalfees incurred at the administrative stage of an antidumping proceedingas meriting similar treatment since they are incurred in defending againstan allegation of dumping. As such, they are not expenses incurred in sellingmerchandise in the United States. See our position on Comment 3 in TelevisionReceivers, Monochrome and Color, from Japan; Final Results of AntidumpingDuty Administrative Review (52 FR 8940, March 20, 1987).<T3>Comment 5: </T3>Zenith argues that the Department should deduct fromUSP the actual amount of estimated antidumping duties paid by the respondents.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. Unlike ordinary duties, antidumpingduty deposits are only estimates. Since we cannot know the actual amountsper sale until we complete an administrative review of a period, usingestimated amounts would result in inaccurate margins. In addition, we donot consider estimated antidumping duty deposits to be expenses relatedto the sales under consideration, therefore, adjusting USP for estimatedantidumping duties would result in artificially inflated margins. For thesereasons the Department's practice is to make no adjustment for these dutydeposits. See our position on Comment 7 in the last final results of reviewof this case (53 FR 4050, February 11, 1988).<T3>Comment 6: </T3>Zenith argues that the Department has incorrectly offsetU.S. commissions with indirect selling expenses in the home market. Zenithcontends that commissions paid on U.S. sales compensate the recipientsfor both direct and indirect selling expenses. Unless the commission isbroken up into its direct and indirect expense components, and the FMVoffset is capped at the level of the U.S. indirect expense element only,Zenith asserts that the commission offset will overcompensate for the indirectexpense portion of the commission and does not allow for the removal fromUSP of the direct selling expense portion of the commission.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. As we have noted elsewhere,andSection; 353.15(c) of our regulations requires us to make an adjustmentfor situations in which a commission is paid in one market and not in theother market. That adjustment is limited to ``actual other selling expenses,''not to exceed the total amount of the commission granted in the other market(19 CFR 353.15(c)). We do not interpret our regulations as requiring usto limit the offset to any portion of the expenses of the commissionaire.Therefore, we have offset the full amount of the commission in the U.S.with indirect selling expenses in the home market. See our position onComment 11 in the last final results of review of the Korean televisioncase (53 FR 24975, July 1, 1988).<T3>Comment 7: </T3>Zenith argues that the Department's policy of instructingCustoms to collect cash deposits for future entries on the basis of a weighted-averagepercentage of entered value understates the amount that should be collectedbecause that percentage is, in fact, based on USP which will always behigher than entered values. Since that percentage will subsequently beapplied to the lower entered value, Zenith argues that it will understatethe true estimated duty.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. At the time of entry of anyshipment USP has yet to be determined. Since cash deposits of estimatedantidumping duties are required at that time, we instruct Customs to requirecash deposits expressed as a percentage of the entered value, which isthe only information available. If the amount of the antidumping dutiesdeposited should be less than the amount assessed, the Department willassess interest on the difference. See our response to Comment 7 of thefinal results of review of this case (52 FR 8940, March 20, 1987) and ourresponse to Comment 15 of the last final results of review of the Koreantelevision case (53 FR 24975, July 1, 1988).<T3>Comment 8: </T3>Zenith contends that the statute does not authorizecircumstance-of-sale adjustments to constructed value. Zenith argues thatif the Department continues to make such circumstance-of-sale adjustmentsin its final calculations, the result of such adjustments may be no lowerthan the cost of manufacture plus the statutory minimum for profit andgeneral expenses.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. Section 773(a)(4)(B) of thestatute instructs us to adjust FMV, of which constructed value is one type,for differences in circumstances of sale. There is nothing in either thestatute or our regulations which directs us to limit the result of suchadjustments to the cost of manufacture plus the statutory minimum for generalexpenses and profit. We note further that our practice of making adjustmentsto constructed value for circumstance-of-sale differences has been upheldby the CIT (<T3>see Timken Co. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>673 F. Supp. 495).<T3>Comment 9: </T3>Zenith argues that the Department should not have allowedMatsushita's period three and five claims for dealers association memberdiscounts because Matsushita has not demonstrated that it did not use thefunds set aside for this program. Zenith further argues that, with respectto the third period, it is not clear how the portion of Matsushita's claimedrebate for improvement of business operation (an expense for a relatedcompany) in the home market was removed from our calculations.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We are satisfied that Matsushita does notmake use of the funds set aside for this deferred discount program. Thereis no evidence on the record that Matsushita used any of the dealers associationmember discount funds. We have no reason to doubt the reasonableness ofthe reported handling of these funds and Zenith gave no evidence to supportits conjecture.Moreover, this position is similar to Comment 2 in which Zenith arguesthat the Department should reduce respondent's claims by any savings thatrespondents may earn by paying the discount/rebate amounts later. In thatcase, we note that even if there were any evidence on the record that Matsushitahad made use of these funds, it would be irrelevant. For further discussionon this issue, <T3>see </T3>Comment 2.Regarding the rebate for improvement of business operations, this consistedof grants to distributors and to a related credit company. We disallowedthe amounts granted to the credit company since we regard them as intracompanytransfers of funds.<T3>Comment 10: </T3>Zenith contends that portions of Matsushita's periodthree claim for sales promotion relating to expenses for leaflets and catalogswere deducted twice.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. The allegation of double countingof this portion of the claims is unfounded. More than one division of Matsushitahad expenses relating to leaflets and catalogs and both sets of expenseswere accounted for.<T3>Comment 11: </T3>Zenith contends that the Department should treat asindirect selling expenses the portions of Matsushita's period three, four,partial five, and eight home market warranty expenses that were performedby related service companies. Zenith contends that the Department has consistentlytreated such warranty expenses as indirect selling expenses in past administrativereviews, and should do so in this review.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. The Department's current practiceis to allow warranty expenses performed by related service companies asdirectly-related selling expenses when we can determine the arms-lengthnature of the warranty expense. Matsushita provided adequate documentationin its submissions and at verification to support its claim that the warrantyservices performed by related service companies were performed at armslength; that is, the expenses were the same whether performed by relatedor unrelated service companies.<T3>Comment 12: </T3>Zenith contends that it is unclear from the materialsreleased to it how the Department computed the average number of days usedin its calculation of Matsushita's home market credit expense for periodthree.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Matsushita's third period response didnot contain any evidence regarding the number of days of outstanding accountsreceivable in either market. In our preliminary determination, as bestinformation available for the home market, we <ITAG tagnum="54">used 15 days as an estimate of the minimum reasonable amount of timeone could expected for outstanding receivables. We have since noted aninconsistency between the methodologies used to determine the appropriateoutstanding accounts receivable periods in the U.S. and the home market.</ITAG>As best information available, we based the U.S. credit period on the termsof payment noted in the response. In the home market Matsushita bills itsdistributors on the 20th of each month for sales occurring between the21st of the previous month and the 20th of the current month. Payment isdue by the end of the current month; within 10 days. Taking an advantageof 15 days outstanding from delivery, plus the 10 days automatically granteduntil payment, we reach a minimum average outstanding receivables basisof 25 days. Therefore, for these final results we have determined thata more reasonable and consistent basis for best information available forthis home market adjustment is 25 days.<T3>Comment 13:</T3> Zenith notes that for the partial fifth and eighthreview periods the Department used Matsushita's sales to dealers, and arguesthat the Department should have used sales to dealers as the basis forFMV for periods three and four as well, rather than those to related distributors.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Matsushita provided price information onsales to home market distributors in response to the Department's questionnairein the third and fourth annual reviews. At that time, however, the Departmentwas considering whether to change its methodology with respect to certainrespondents in the proceeding, including Matsushita, and use sales by distributorsto dealers. This methodological change would have required that Matsushitacompletely revise its voluminous response. As part of verification theDepartment collected data on sales by several Matsushita distributors tohome market TV dealers. While the information collected was not complete,we have determined that there would be no margins even with complete distributor-to-dealerinformation, given the magnitude of negative margins on almost all salesresulting from our use of prices to distributors to calculate FMV. Eventhough the Department has the authority to apply the methodology employedin the fifth and eighth reviews to the third and fourth reviews, we havedecided that it would be an unreasonable burden on all parties to requestand analyze this information in light of the time constraints in this caseand the likely failure of the new information to affect the final determinationsin these reviews. Failure to obtain this information is, in our view, harmless.<T3>Comment 14:</T3> Zenith argues that there is no support for Matsushita'speriod three inventory financing calculation, neither for the inventoryvalue nor the interest rate used. Additionally, Zenith argues that theDepartment should use the U.S. interest rate since the U.S. subsididariestook title to the goods on an FOB Japan basis.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The Department disagrees with Zenith'sassertion that for the third and fourth periods there was no support onthe record for the Department's inventory financing calculations.Additionally, the Department disagrees with Zenith's argument that we shoulduse U.S. interest rates based solely on when Matsushita's subsidiariestook title to the goods. However, we are persuaded by Zenith's argumentsthat certain portions of our calculations should be changed.The date that a company takes title to goods is generally not relevantin determining the inventory interest rate. The rate depends on the sourceof the loans used to finance inventory and maintain a company's operations.In this case, there are two components to inventory cost, purchase priceof the goods and movement costs. Three of the U.S. subsidiaries boughtthe goods ``at sight'', that is, they paid for the goods at the time ofshipment. Thus, these subsidiaries accrued inventory carrying charges basedon U.S. interest rates. The fourth U.S. subsidiary received 150 day termsfrom Matsushita. This subsidiary normally sold from stock within this period,so it incurred no inventory carrying expense. However, by extending thecredit to cover the inventory period, Matsushita incurred the inventorycarrying cost at Japanese interest rates.The correct basis to impute inventory carrying charges in this case isthe total cost to the purchasing group of buying the merchandise and gettingthe product to its warehouse. All four of Matsushita's U.S. subsidiariespurchased the goods on an FOB Japan basis. As such, the four subsidiariespaid for all movement costs, accruing inventory carrying charges for thisportion of the inventory cost at U.S. interest rates.For all four subsidiaries, the Department used 90 days as the inventoryperiod, as best information available, since this is the maximum inventoryperiod claimed by Matsushita.<T3>Comment 15:</T3> Zenith argues that the Department should use salesvalue to reallocate Matsushita's U.S. selling expenses, half of which Matsushitaallocated by quantity and half by sales value.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We agree. In accordance with our establishedpractice we have allocated these U.S. expenses solely by sales value.<T3>Comment 16:</T3> Zenith notes that in its response for the third periodMatsushita miscalculated the sales promotion expense for Quasar's blackand white (``B/W'') TV sales.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Matsushita admits that this was a clericalerror on its part. We have revised the calculations accordingly.<T3>Comment 17:</T3> Zenith claims that Matsushita's calculation of indirectselling expenses for period five omitted the expenses incurred by MatsushitaElectric Trading Company (MET) and other export-related expenses incurredin Japan.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We note that MET did incur export-relatedselling expenses during period five and we have included them in our calculationof indirect selling expenses for these final results.<T3>Comment 18: </T3>Zenith contends that for Matsushita the Departmentmade no adjustment for the credit expense on U.S. accounts receivable forperiods three and four.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree and have accounted for this expensein our calculations for these final results. To establish the credit periodin the U.S., we used as best information available the payment terms Matsushitaoffered its customers.<T3>Comment 19: </T3>Zenith contends that the Department's calculationfor Matsushita of taxable value for period three is incorrect because theDepartment failed to remove packing, and because the taxable value wasbased upon the resale price instead of the FOB price.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree in part. The Japanese commoditytax methodology stipulates that the taxable base should represent an ex-factory,unpacked price. Zenith is correct that packing costs should have been removedfrom the calculation. We have made this correction. Regarding the pricewe used, see our position on Comment 33.<T3>Comment 20: </T3>Zenith argues that, to the extent that Matsushita'sfourth period submission and the Department's fourth period analysis reflectthe same deficiencies that Zenith observed in Matsushita's period threesubmission and the Department's third period analysis, the Department shouldapply Zenith's comments on Matsushita's period three submission and theDepartment's third period analysis to Matsushita's period four submissionand the Department's fourth period analysis. Zenith makes the same argumentfor the partial fifth and eighth period reviews. Further, Zenith arguesthat to the extent Victor's submissions contain the same errors as Matsushita'ssubmissions, Zenith's Matsushita comments apply equally to Victor.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree in part. For periods three andfour the Department's computer programs were extremely similar, as wereMatsushita's submissions. Since clerical errors noted by Zenith in thethird-period program are readily identifiable in the fourth-period program,we have considered clerical error comments covering the third period asapplicable to the fourth period. The analyses of these two periods werealso essentially the same. Therefore, insofar as we were able to identifythe same elements in each review, we considered the comments for the thirdperiod as applicable to the fourth period.However, for periods five and eight the Department's computer programswere not extremely similar, nor were Matsushita's submissions, clericalerrors noted by Zenith in the fifth-period program are not necessarilyreadily identifiable in the eighth-period program, and the analyses ofthese two periods were not essentially the same. Therefore, absent evidenceon the record, we cannot assume that the real or perceived deficienciesnoted by Zenith concerning Matsushita's partial fifth period submissionrelates to period eight as well. Similarly, absent evidence on the record,we cannot assume that errors which apply to Matsushita's submissions applyequally to Victor. If Zenith perceives that our preliminary results analysiswas in error for Victor, it is Zenith's responsibility to identify specificallythe perceived errors that concern Victor.<T3>Comment 21: </T3>Zenith contends that one Matsushita home market modeldid not qualify for the any of the discounts comprising the ``discountto meet competition'' program for period four, and that the Departmentshould revise its calculations to account for this.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree in part. The model in questionqualified for several of these discounts, but not for all. In our finalcalculations we deducted the discounts for which the model qualified.<T3>Comment 22: </T3>Zenith contends that the Department twice deductedindirect advertising expenses of Matsushita's Consumer Sales Division,once as indirect expenses, and again as direct expenses, in the periodfour advertising claim.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree. We have corrected the final computerprogram for the fourth period to only allow Matsushita's Consumer SalesDivision's advertising expenses as indirect expenses.<T3>Comment 23: </T3>Zenith argues that, since the Department lacked actualproprietary data for Matsushita's indirect U.S. selling expenses for periodsthree and four, the Department should have used the largest actual fifthperiod amount instead of using the largest non-proprietary amount for theseperiods. In addition, Zenith contends that it did not receive the narrativeportion of Matsushita's period four response.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Matsushita correctly notes that the questionnaireresponses for both the third and fourth period contained actual indirectselling expense amounts which had been overlooked by the Department; therefore,we used that data for these final results. This renders Zenith's positionmoot. The Department made available to all parties to this proceeding allmaterials which it used in making its preliminary determination, eitherpublicly available versions or proprietary versions released under administrativeprotective orders. This includes release to Zenith of the third and thefourth period narrative responses to the questionnaire on which the Departmentrelied in its final analysis. <T3>Comment 24: </T3>Zenith asserts that Matsushita improperly made itsown model match selections in the partial fifth period review. Zenith assertsthat it is the Department's responsibility to make model match selectionsand that abdication of this responsibility by the Department is unlawful.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We have not abdicated our model match responsibilitiesin this review. For several models we instructed Matsushita to prepareits model match selections according to past model match selections thatwe had made for Matsushita. Matsushita followed these instructions in preparingits period five response. <T3>Comment 25: </T3>Zenith argues that the Department improperly acceptedclaims by Matsushita that reflect inconsistent levels of detail. Zenithcontends that such inconsistencies permit a respondent to manipulate individualclaims in whatever manner most benefits them. Specifically, Zenith objects to Matsushita's freight and packing claims.For example, for Matsushita's distributors' sales to dealers and for theinland freight expense incurred by Matsushita in transferring the merchandisefrom the B/W factory to Matsushita's distributors, although Matsushita'spartial fifth period response includes distributor-specific inland freightamounts. Matsushita then claimed freight only on a model-specific basis.Additionally, Zenith objects to Matsushita basing its claim for home marketcolor TV (CTV) expenses on a quarterly basis, while basing its home marketB/W claim on an annual basis. Zenith objects further to Matsushita basingits home market packing claims on a monthly basis while submitting itsdiscount and rebate claims on a semiannual basis. Finally, Zenith objectsto Matsushita's submission of separate home market claims for CTV and B/Wsales while not making such a distinction for its U.S. inland freight claim.Zenith contends that these inconsistencies create the possibility thatMatsushita assigned more expenses to CTVs in Japan and less expenses toCTVs in the United States.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. The ``inconsistencies'' whichZenith mentions are due to the fact that Matsushita's U.S. and home marketinland freight, home market discounts and rebates, and home market packingexpenses were incurred by a number of different accounting entities. Theseentities have varying fiscal periods, do not maintain their records inan identical manner, and engage in a variety of different businesses. Forexample, Matsushita manufactures B/W TVs at a different factory than theones at which it manufactures CTVs. Home market inland freight expensesfor B/W TVs and CTVs are incurred by different accounting entities. Inthe United States, however, each Matsushita subsidiary ships both CTVsand B/W televisions. This difference in business conditions accounts forthe different bases Matsushita used for reporting home market and U.S.inland freight expenses. The Department's usual practice is to accept the respondent's method ofallocation if the company uses the method in its ordinary course of businessand if it is reasonable. We verified each of the claims mentioned aboveand found that they were as detailed as the accounting records of the relevantMatsushita accounting entity permitted, and were consistent with the waythe entity conducted its business. We found no evidence to support Zenith'sassertion that Matsushita had manipulated its accounting records in anattempt to distort particular claims to its benefit. <T3>Comment 26: </T3>In the partial fifth period review Zenith objectsto Matsushita's allocation of portions of its U.S. and home market inlandfreight claims based on sales value.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree that allocations of freight costsby volume, weight, distance, or a combination of these, are preferableto allocations based on sales value. However, Matsushita's records werenot maintained on these bases, and we found allocations based on salesvalue both to be reasonable and not to produce distorted results. <T3>Comment 27: </T3>Zenith contends that Matsushita in its fifth periodcomputer submission incorrectly attributed the April and May 1983 discountand rebate schedules to its June 1983 sales.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree and have revised our calculationsaccordingly. <T3>Comment 28: </T3>Zenith argues that since Matsushita's fifth periodhome-market sales promotion claim is not presented on a model-specificbasis, the Department should treat the entire claim as an indirect sellingexpense.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. We verified that Matsushita'shome market sales promotion expenses were not maintained on a model-specificbasis. Matsushita properly allocated these expenses to televisions by productline. Generally, the Department's current practice is to allow product-lineallocations of advertising and sales promotion expenses as directly-relatedselling expenses. The Department has found that model-specific allocations often lead toinaccurate and erratic results since most companies do not keep such recordson a model-specific basis. Additionally, preparation of model-specificallocations is often unnecessarily burdensome for both respondents andthe Department. Accordingly, with respect to televisions, Commerce hasreturned to its original position that allocating advertising and salespromotion expenses on a more detailed level than product-line is ``unreasonableand unrealistic.''

We do not take the position that model-specific allocations of advertisingand sales promotion expenses could never be reasonable in any other case_onlythat they were unreasonable given the specific circumstances of this proceeding.(See Defendant's Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for JudgmentUpon the Agency Record, Zenith Electronics Corp. v. The United States,Consol. Court No. 88-02-00122.) <T3>Comment 29: </T3>Zenith contends that the Department's treatment ofQuasar (QC) models WP2132WW, WP2132TW, and WP2132UW as identical models,and the Department's treatment of models UP2133TW and UP2133WW for thepartial fifth review period as identical is appropriate only if the Departmenthas ascertained that these models were subject to the same adjustment claimsand the Department recalls having done this when preparing past masterlists for Customs.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>At verification QC provided adequate documentationto show that these are identical models. The last two letters of QC's modelnumber are for internal identification purposes. They denote characteristicsof the model that do not represent physical differences in merchandise,for example, cabinet color. The Department is not bound by past list formulations. While we attemptto be consistent from one review to the next, we review each period independentlyand may determine that a change in analysis is appropriate.<T3>Comment 30:</T3> Zenith contends that the Department did not explainwhy in its computer program it altered QC's claimed amount of certain indirectselling expenses for the partial fifth period review.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The claimed indirect selling expenses inquestion consisted of commissions paid by QC to unrelated parties. We considerthese expenses to be direct selling expenses. Accordingly, to avoid doublecounting them, we excluded commissions to unrelated parties from QC's poolof indirect selling expenses.<T3>Comment 31:</T3> In the fifth period review Zenith contends that theDepartment failed to include the indirect selling expenses incurred byMatsushita prior to transfer of the merchandise to Matsushita ElectricTrading Company (``MET''). Zenith further contends that in its calculationof U.S. indirect selling expenses the Department failed to capture theexpenses incurred by Matsushita Electric Corporation of America (``MECA'').<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. Matsushita incurred no indirectselling expenses prior to transferring televisions to MET. Further, Matsushitareported the expenses incurred by MECA in its U.S. indirect selling expenses,and the Department included these in its calculation of U.S. indirect sellingexpenses.<T3>Comment 32:</T3> Zenith argues that the Department's calculation ofthe amount of Matsushita's forgiven commodity tax is incorrect for thepartial fifth review period because (1) the labor component of packingis not removed from the calculation and (2) the Department used the FOBJapan price in its calculations instead of the price from Matsushita toMET.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. The labor component of packingis inseparable from the labor expense included within Matsushita's finalassembly operation. In order to achieve an ``apples-to-apples'' comparisonwe left this expense in our calculation of the U.S. taxable base sinceit is also included in the home market taxable base. We used the FOB pricefrom MET to the U.S. subsidiary less the material component of packingand movement expenses because it constitutes a reasonable approximationof the ex-factory price. Finally, we note that any difference between theDepartment's and any respondent's calculation of the forgiven commoditytax is effectively nullified by the commodity tax circumstance-of-saleadjustment.<T3>Comment 33:</T3> Zenith argues that for purposes of calculating QC'spartial fifth period credit calculation the Department should add threedays to QC's average age of accounts receivable. Zenith contends that thisadjustment is necessary to account for the time between QC's shipment dateand QC's date of invoice.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. In most cases QC's date ofshipment was the invoice date. Further we note that we already accountedfor the period of time preceding the invoice date in our calculation ofQC's inventory carrying costs.<T3>Comment 34:</T3> Zenith argues that the Department should not allowhome market transit insurance as a direct expense for the partial fifthperiod review unless it can ascertain that U.S. transit insurance has alsobeen deducted as a direct expense.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We verified that Matsushita fully reportedthe insurance costs that it incurred in both markets and we deducted theseexpenses from both USP and FMV.<T3>Comment 35:</T3> Zenith contends that the credit rates used by Matsushitain its partial fifth period response reflect interest rates which werenot negotiated at arms length. Zenith asserts that, to the extent thisis true, Matsushita's U.S. credit costs are understated.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. Matsushita based its calculationof U.S. credit expenses on the interest rate that MECA paid on loans fromunrelated parties. This was confirmed at verification.<T3>Comment 36:</T3> Zenith contends that the Department should not acceptQC's assertion that commissions to unrelated parties in the partial fifthperiod are de minimis. Rather, Zenith argues that the Department shoulduse the best information available for this expense.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We verified that QC's commission amountswere correctly reported, considered them as direct selling expenses, anddeducted them from USP.<T3>Comment 37:</T3> Zenith objects to Matsushita's failure to report inits partial fifth period response its U.S. warranty, advertising, and salespromotion expenses on a model-specific basis.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>See our position on Comment 28 for product-lineallocations of advertising and sales promotion expenses. Matsushita reportedits U.S. warranty expenses at the same level of detail as exists in itsaccounting records.<T3>Comment 38:</T3> For the partial fifth review period, Zenith claimsthat the data supporting Matsushita's calculation of product lead time,finished goods inventory time, and Japanese warehouse time are not containedin Matsushita's June 15, 1988 submission and are missing from the record.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Zenith is mistaken. In response to ourrequest for supplemental information, Matsushita provided this data inits August 5, 1988 submission.<T3>Comment 39:</T3> Zenith contends that Matsushita's calculation of oceanfreight for the partial fifth period review for model WP2132UW is understated.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree. Matsushita reported the wrongocean freight figure. We have corrected our calculations accordingly.<T3>Comment 40:</T3> For periods five and eight, Zenith objects to theDepartment offsetting Matsushita's U.S. subsidiaries' general and administrativeexpenses with imputed interest and credit expenses. Zenith asserts thatneither the credit adjustment nor the imputed interest calculation capturethe same expenses as are reflected in QC's Pandamp;L.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. Money is fungible. The interestexpense shown in the Pandamp;Ls of Matsushita's U.S. subsidiaries reflectthese entities' entire financing costs. Since Matsushita's imputed interestcalculation included the time the merchandise was on the water, the timeit was in inventory, and the time between its sale and payment. Deductingall of the general and administrative expenses shown in the subsidiaries'financial statements, in addition to deducting imputed interest and credit,would involve double-counting a portion of Matsushita's interest expenses.The CIT has enjoined us from double-counting interest expenses (see SilverReed America, Inc. v. United States, 683 F. Supp. 1393, 1395) (CIT 1988).We note that we have also reduced Matsushita's home market general andadministrative expenses to avoid any double-counting. (See our positionon Comments 14 and 91.)<T3>Comment 41:</T3> Zenith contends that for the partial fifth periodthe calculation of inventory carrying costs is incorrect for one entryof model UP1762UJ. Zenith further contends that the landed cost that QCused to calculate the inventory carrying costs for model WP2132TW is understated.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree. Matsushita reported the wrongfigures and we have adjusted our calculations accordingly.<T3>Comment 42:</T3> Zenith asserts that Panasonic Corporation's (PC) calculationof U.S. duty is understated for one entry in the partial fifth period review.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree and have adjusted our calculationsaccordingly.<T3>Comment 43:</T3> In the partial fifth period review Zenith assertsthat PC incorrectly calculated the ``on-the-water'' financing expense applicableto one entry. Zenith asserts that PC should have used 14 rather than 13days.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree; however, using 14 days stillresults in the same adjustment (rounded to two decimal places) as PC hadoriginally calculated.<T3>Comment 44:</T3> Zenith contends that PC should have used landed, ratherthan FOB, cost in its calculation of inventory carrying costs for the partialfifth review period.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>PC did, in fact, base its calculation ofinventory carrying costs upon landed costs.<T3>Comment 45:</T3> In the partial fifth review Zenith contends that PCfailed to adequately explain how the Home Appliance Division (``HAD'')and Home Appliance Division Western Group (``HAD WG Adj'') calculationsshown on PC's profit and loss statement were removed from PC's calculationof direct and indirect selling expenses. Zenith contends that it is unclearfrom PC's submission that the sales of HAD WG Adj have been removed fromPC's allocations since PC stated that it could not separately identifythat division's accounts receivable expenses.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>PC appropriately removed the HAD and HADWG Adj expenses from its allocation of U.S. direct and indirect sellingexpenses, since neither entity was involved in TV sales. We note that weverified PC's claim for direct and indirect selling expenses and, withthe exception of PC having based half its claimed U.S. expenses on quantityand half on sales value (see our position on Comment 15), found no discrepancies.<T3>Comment 46:</T3> In the partial fifth period review, Zenith contendsthat the Department should have treated certain PC sales commissions asdirect selling expenses, since PC's narrative response only mentioned commissionsto unrelated parties. Zenith further contends that certain negative expensesshould not have been removed from PC's pool of U.S. indirect selling expenses.For example, a negative expense shown in PC's Pandamp;L statement as an offsetto PC's total net payroll expense indicates that, although PC may considerit as income reducing its own expense, it is still a positive expense forMatsushita. It is immaterial which corporate affiliate records it as anexpense; it is still a positive indirect U.S. selling expense attributableto an entity within the corporate family. Therefore, the Department shouldtreat all these ``negative expenses'' as indirect U.S. selling expensesand reduce USP accordingly.Matsushita counters that it made no payments to PC, and that what occurredcorporate-wide is not relevant; the applicable expense is the actual expenseof PC for TVs.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree with Zenith in part. ThesePC sales commissions were paid, in fact, to related parties, and thus wereproperly claimed by PC as indirect selling expenses. As for the line itemson PC's Pandamp;L which were recorded as negative expenses, we agree withZenith. If one member of the corporate family, such as PC, records theseitems as negative expenses, the Pandamp;L of the other corporate family member(in this case, MEI) should reflect a corresponding amount as positive expenses.Even if we had any such evidence, however, it would be immaterial; thepoint is that positive expenses were incurred. Therefore, we have not consideredthese negative expenses as offsets to U.S. indirect selling expenses. Finally,as we noted in our response to Comment 31, Matsushita fully accounted forthe U.S. indirect selling expenses incurred by MET and MECA.<T3>Comment 47:</T3> Zenith notes that in its partial fifth review responsePC claimed a much smaller aggregate expense for national advertising thanis shown in PC's Pandamp;L statement.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>PC prepared its TV-related advertisingclaim in accordance with the Department's instructions. The amount of advertisingshown in PC's Pandamp;L statement reflects PC's entire advertising budget.PC associated the expenses incurred by the Consumer Electronic Group withall sales of that group, the entity that incurred PC's national advertisingexpense for televisions.<T3>Comment 48:</T3> In the partial fifth period review Zenith argues thatwe should treat PC's ``anticipation'' expense (PC's expenses for an earlypayment program) as a direct selling expense and exclude it from PC's generaland administrative expenses. Zenith further objects to the Department'sacceptance of the Consumer Electronics Products Division's ``over and short''expense as a negative expense, when PC as a whole experienced a positiveexpense.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree in part. We have treated PC's``anticipation'' expense as a direct selling expense in our final calculations.The ``over and short'' expense item in the general and administrative expenseswas an expense associated with inventory overages and shortages in consumerelectronic products. Since an adjustment for this expense would have aninsignificant effect on FMV, we have not changed our calculations, pursuantto Section 777A(a)(2) of the Tariff Act, which authorizes disregardinginsignificant adjustments. Thus, how to treat this expense in this instanceis moot. For a discussion of our treatment of such negative expenses generally,see our position on Comment 46.<T3>Comment 49:</T3> Zenith argues that Panasonic Hawaii (PHI) incorrectlyquantified its warranty, national advertising, co-op advertising, salespromotion, freight, and indirect selling expense claims for the partialfifth review period. Specifically, Zenith points to the discrepancy betweenthe amount of these claims shown on PHI's Pandamp;L statement and the amountsclaimed in PHI's response. Zenith further objects to PHI's indirect expensesvarying by model. Zenith suggests that we disregard PHI's calculation ofU.S. indirect selling expenses and use the amount shown in PHI's Pandamp;Lstatement.Finally, since PHI did not adequately quantify its claims for U.S. indirectselling expenses, Zenith argues that as best information available we shouldreclassify as direct selling expenses that portion of PHI's indirect expenseswhich is equal to the portion reclassified for PC or QC, whichever is greater.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. PHI's Pandamp;L statement coversthe period January 1, 1983 to December 31, 1983. In preparing its responsePHI reported the actual expenses incurred from April 1, 1983 through August31, 1983. This accounts for the difference between the data shown in PHI'spartial fifth period response and the information shown in PHI's Pandamp;Lstatement. Finally, we note that the differences in PHI's per-model indirectselling expenses are due to varying times in inventory.<T3>Comment 50: </T3>Zenith argues that PHI's ``cash discount'' and ``anticipationexpenses'' should be removed from Panasonic Industrial Company's (PIC)pool of other selling expenses and treated as direct selling expenses.Zenith further contends that there is a discrepancy between the expensesshown in PIC's Pandamp;L statement and the adjustments shown in PIC's partialfifth period response.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree in part. We have revised our finalcalculations, and deducted PIC's ``cash discount'' and treated its ``anticipation''expenses as direct selling expenses (for the latter, <T3>see </T3>our position on Comment 48). As for the seeming discrepancybetween PIC's Pandamp;L statement and its partial fifth period discrepancybetween PIC's Pandamp;L statement and its partial fifth period responses,PIC based its submission upon the Pandamp;L statement of the Audio VideoSales Division (AVSD). We obtained a copy of the AVSD Pandamp;L at verificationand noted no discrepancies between the information shown in that statementand the information shown in PIC's response.<T3>Comment 51: </T3>In the partial fifth period review Zenith argues thatPanasonic Sales Corporation (PSC) misallocated its claims for U.S. indirectselling, general and administrative, warrant, servicing, advertising, andsales promotion expenses since it allocated a disproportionate amount ofthis expense to B/W TVs. Additionally, Zenith objects to PSC includingrebate expenses in its claim for U.S. general and administrative expenses.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree in part. As noted in our responseto Comment 15, we reallocated based on sales value those expenses whichMatsushita allocated half on quantity and half on sales value. We have not changed our treatment of PSC's advertising and sales promotionexpenses, however, since PSC properly based these claims upon its actualexperience. Finally, in our final calculations we treated PSC's rebatesas such, and not as indirect selling expenses.<T3>Comment 52: </T3>Zenith contends that PSC improperly charged a portionof its partial fifth period freight-out expenses to Virgin Islands sales,even though all of the freight-out expenses were incurred on Puerto Ricansales. Zenith argues that we should attribute these expenses exclusivelyto those sales for which PSC incurred freight-out expenses.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Zenith's concern is unfounded because PSCclaimed all of these freight-out expenses for its Puerto Rican sales anddid not claim any of them for its Virgin Islands sales.<T3>Comment 53: </T3>In the fifth period review Zenith contends that PSCfailed to report its commission expense incurred on its military sales.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. PSC reported this expensein its claimed amount for U.S. commissions.<T3>Comment 54: </T3>Zenith contends that PSC failed to identify its repackingexpense incurred on Virgin Islands sales in the partial fifth period.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>PSC included this expense in its claimfor general and administrative expenses. We agree that this expense shouldproperly have been included in PSC's U.S. packing expense. However, anadjustment for this expense would have an insignificant effect upon ourmargin calculations. Therefore, pursuant to section 777A(a)(2) of the TariffAct, we have not changed our calculations.<T3>Comment 55: </T3>Zenith objects to Matsushita's including various negativeamounts in its calculation of period eight home market indirect sellingexpenses. Zenith contends that Matsushita thereby understates its homemarket indirect selling expenses.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree. See our position on Comment 46.<T3>Comment 56: </T3>Zenith argues that the Department should ensure thatthe exchange rate in effect on the U.S. sale date is used for Matsushita'sU.S. sales after September 1987.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We based all currency conversions on theexchange rate in effect on the U.S. date of sale.<T3>Comment 57: </T3>For Toshiba, Zenith argues that the Department shouldnot base FMV on sales to related distributors because the administrativereview should be based on sales between the respondent and the first unrelatedparty in the distribution chain.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>In conformity with 19 CFR 353.22, the Departmentdoes not base FMV on prices to related parties unless it is satisfied thatthe sales in question are based on arms-length prices. In Toshiba's case,since the sales to related distributors were made at prices comparableto those charged to unrelated distributors, we are satisfied that priceswere arms-length; therefore, we used them to calculate FMV. However, weare concerned about the possible effects of applying this standard to caseswhere the percentage of sales to unrelated customers is small in comparisonwith sales to related customers and we plan to reexamine this issue inreviews of subsequent periods. For example, we did not use sales from Matsushita to its distributors forpurposes of determining FMV for the partial fifth and eighth review periodsbecause the preponderance of Matsushita's sales to related distributorsvis-a-vis sales to unrelated distributors made Matsushita's sales to unrelateddistributors captive.<T3>Comment 58: </T3>Zenith contends that the Department should not treatToshiba's freight from the factory to the warehouse as a movement expensebecause it is apparently pre-sale freight and is, therefore, an indirectselling expense. If the Department continues to treat it as a movementor directly-related selling expense, it should not be allocated over salesvalue.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Since Toshiba did not indicate whetherthis was a pre-sale or post-sale expense, we agree with Zenith that thisis an indirect selling expense; therefore, in accordance with our standardpractice, we have allocated this indirect selling expense over sales value.<T3>Comment 59: </T3>Zenith claims that, since trade magazine advertisingis not directed at the customer's customers, it should be treated as anindirect selling expense, not as a direct selling expense as reported inToshiba's response.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree and have made the appropriatechange.<T3>Comment 60: </T3>Zenith also argues that the Department should nottreat Toshiba's payments to Toshiba Credit Co., improperly claimed as aportion of sales promotion expenses, as directly-related selling expenses,but, it anything, as indirect selling expenses.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree. In its preliminary results theDepartment increased the claimed amount of sales promotion expenses bythe amount which Toshiba paid to Toshiba Credit Co. to boost credit sales.This amount was originally claimed by Toshiba as a credit expense, butat verification it was shown to be of a promotional nature. The verificationreport does not reveal the nature or quality of the promotional effort,however. But since the payment was verified as intended merely to boostcredit sales generally and not specific TV sales during the review period,for these final results we have treated it as an indirect selling expense.We intend to reexamine this issue in reviews of subsequent periods, ifapplicable.<T3>Comment 61: </T3>Zenith argues that for Toshiba the Department shoulduse the highest reported U.S. inventory time instead of an average time,because there appears to be no information reported that would permit aweighted-average calculation.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. We have no reason to doubtthe reasonableness of the reported average time and Zenith gave no evidenceto support its allegation.<T3>Comment 62: </T3>Zenith notes Victor's assertion that the Departmentfailed to make a circumstance-of-sale adjustment to CV for home marketwarranty parts expenses. Zenith further notes Victor's claim that the Departmentincorrectly used U.S. selling expenses to adjust the CV of model C-1483UM.With respect to such claims, Zenith contends that there is no authoritydirecting the Department to adjust CV for differences in circumstancesof sale.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. <T3>See </T3>our position on Comment 8.<T3>Comment 63: </T3>Zenith asserts that since Victor claimed it couldnot separately identify packing labor in its response, the Department actedproperly in not making a packing labor adjustment to USP.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>See our position on Comment 84.<T3>Comment 64: </T3>Zenith notes various statements in the Department'sverification report for Victor which led Zenith to believe that certainof Victor's claims would be denied in whole or in part. However, the Department'spreliminary analysis memo does not indicate if these claims were alteredin any way.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>All the items noted in Zenith's argumentwere allowed except for the following: Victor Shop Discount, Cash Discount,Discount to Support Dealer Margin for Tohto and Osaka, and all of the advertisingclaim except for the portion incurred by the Corporate Advertising andPublic Relations Department (CAPRD).<T3>Comment 65: </T3>Zenith disputes Victor's contention that, as a resultof the verification exercise, several of its claimed adjustments were wrongfullydisallowed by the Department. Zenith asserts that the Department shouldnot grant an adjustment to FMV that did not verify. Zenith objects to theDepartment's refusal to release the verification documents and verification-likedocuments (containing new information) which Victor appended to its brief,as this precludes Zenith's full participation in the briefing process.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The Department has disallowed several portionsof Victor's claimed home market adjustments which were not satisfactorilyverified. To the extent that Victor submitted unsolicited verification-likedocuments as appendices to its pre-hearing brief, they were untimely and,therefore, not considered for these final results. Because we did not usethese documents for the final determination, the issue of their releaseto Zenith is moot.Analysis of Respondents' Comments<T3>Comment 66: </T3>For the fifth and eighth review periods Matsushitacontends that the Department should base FMB on MEI's prices to distributors,and not upon the distributors' resale prices to dealers. Matsushita contendsthat basing FMV upon the distributors' prices to dealers unfairly skewsthe review results to Matsushita's detriment and is a violation of ``traditionalmethodology.'' Matsushita further contends that since it incurred muchlarger selling expenses on its home market sales to dealers, the Department'sapplication of the ESP cap further distorts the review results.Finally, Matsushita argues that assuming, <T3>arguendo, </T3>that the Department properly based FMV on MEI's distributors'resale prices, the department cannot do so retroactively. Matsushita arguesthat it has priced televisions in reliance on the ``traditional methodology''.If the Department intends to base FMV upon MEI's distributors' resale prices,Matsushita argues that the Department is obliged to give Matshshita adequatenotice of that intention.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We addressed this issue in previous reviewsof this case. (See our position on Comment 27 in our previous review (52FR 8943, March 20, 1987).) We reiterate our position that in the 1980 settlementagreements the Department's commitment was to: (1) Forego the use of thecommodity tax method for calculating FMV previously applied by the Departmentof the Treasury and the Customs Service; and (2) rely upon informationand data submitted by the Japanese respondents, provided that such datawere adequate and verified. This commitment did not constitute an agreementto ``freeze'' the antidumping law in time as of 1980.We note further that our reviews are not subject to the AdministrativeProcedures Act. Consequently, as we have stated elsewhere, we need notapply changes in methodology only on a prospective basis. (See our positionon Comment 1 in the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value;Color Television Receivers from Korea, 49 FR 7620, March 1, 1984.)<T3>Comment 67: </T3>Matsushita argues that the Department understatedthe amount of commodity tax that would have been imposed upon Matsushita-producedU.S. models had they been subject to the Japanese commodity tax. Specifically,Matsushita argues that we should use in our final calculations the transferprice to Matsushita's U.S. subsidiary, less packing costs and the 5 percentfor related-party profit permitted by Japanese tax law.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. Japanese law provides severaldifferent methods for the assessment of commodity taxes; the amount offorgiven tax could be computed in a number of different ways. The Department,however, lacks the resources to determine how each respondent would calculatethe amount of forgiven commodity tax in every instance. The method we choseto calculate the forgiven amount of Japanese commodity tax is a reasonableone and is consistent with the Japanese law. Moreover, as Matsushita itselfrecognizes, we offset any difference in our calculation of the amount ofMatsushita's forgiven U.S. commodity tax and the calculation Matsushitamakes since we made a circumstance-of-sale adjustment for differences incommodity taxes.<T3>Comment 68: </T3>Matsushita argues that the Department's calculationof U.S. imputed interest expenses is improper since Matsushita's submissionsreflect the actual expenses incurred by Matsushita on its U.S. sales. Matsushitafurther contends that, if the Department continues to make an imputed interestadjustment it should offset Matsushita's U.S. subsidiaries' general andadministrative expenses by the amount of these imputed expenses.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree in part. Matsushita's financingof inventory constitutes a real expense to the company which we adjustedfor in our preliminary calculations (See our position on Comment 7 in theFinal Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Certain All-TerrainVehicles from Japan, 54 FR 4864, January 31, 1989). As noted in our positionon Comment 40 of this notice, we deducted interest expenses from Matsushita'sU.S. general and administrative expenses to avoid double-counting theseexpenses.<T3>Comment 69: </T3>Matsushita argues that, if the Department continuesto adjust ESP for imputed interest, it should similarly adjust its partialfifth review period FMV calculations for imputed interest expenses.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree and have adjusted our calculationsaccordingly.<T3>Comment 70: </T3>Matsushita argues that the Department improperly usedMatsushita's U.S. television resale prices to calculate imputed inventorycarrying costs for the third and fourth reviews. Matsushita argues that,if such an adjustment is made, it should be based upon the FOB price insteadof the resale price.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The Department did err in using the fullsales price to dealers to compute the imputed interest expense. We havecorrected for this in these final results. <T3>See </T3>our position on Comment 14.<T3>Comment 71: </T3>Matsushita observes that for the third and fourthreviews the Department should calculate weighted-average margins ratherthan simple average margins.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree. However, since we found no marginsfor the third and fourth periods, this point is moot.<T3>Comment 72: </T3>Matsushita argues that in its partial fifth periodcalculations of merchandise differences, the Department improperly imputedproduction costs for two U.S. models.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree and have adjusted our calculationsaccordingly. We note that we also corrected our calculations in this respectfor two other U.S. models.<T3>Comment 73: </T3>Matsushita argues that the Department should deletePSC's returns from its calculations for the partial fifth period sales.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree and have adjusted our calculationsaccordingly.<T3>Comment 74: </T3>Matsushita argues that the Department should baseits calculation of eighth period production costs for U.S. models on thedate of entry instead of the U.S. resale date. Matsushita argues that thiswould yield a much more accurate differences-in-merchandise calculation.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. Our current practice is tobase our differences-in-merchandise calculations upon the respective homemarket and U.S. dates of sale, since presumably any such differences areknown as of the date of sale and are accounted for in the respective homemarket and U.S. selling prices.<T3>Comment 75: </T3>Matsushita and Victor argue that the Department shouldabandon the eighth review and base its revocation decision on the third,fourth, and partial fifth reviews. Both firms contend that the Departmenthas intentionally delayed rendering a revocation decision and that theDepartment should not take advantage of such conduct, to their detriment,by conducting the eighth period review.Matsushita and Victor argue that even if currency fluctuations result inmargins for the eight review period, the Department should proceed withrevocation based on the record as to ``likelihood of resumption'' of less-than-fair-market-valuesales and the ``gap period'' reviews (third, fourth, and partial fifthperiods). They argue that the regulatory scheme does not intend that the``likelihood of resumption'' decision, which should have been made in 1983and 1984, should be influenced by events years later.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. The CIT has confirmed thatin determining whether or not to revoke a case the Department may considerevents after the date of the tentative decision to revoke. (<T3>See UST, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>Appeal No. 87-1134 (October 15, 1987).) Furthermore,the Court of Appeals refused to enjoin the Department from conducting theMatsushita and Victor eighth period reviews, <T3>Matsushita Electrical </T3>v. <T3>U.S. </T3>(Slip Op. 88-1463) (Federal Circuit 1988). Moreover, we takeissue with the assertion that we intentionally delayed the completion ofMatsushita's and Victor's revocation. Matsushita's tardiness in respondingto our January 3, 1984 request for distributors' resale price information,and Matsushita and Victor's obtaining a temporary injunction enjoiningus from conducting a review of their post-tentative revocation sales, significantlydelayed our processing their revocation request. We note that the marginsassociated with Matsushita's and Victor's period eight sales indicate the``likelihood of resumption'' of U.S. sales at less than foreign marketvalue. Finally, we note that in determining whether to revoke we have noauthority to account for fluctuations in exchange rates beyond what isspecific in section 353.56(b) of our regulations, which refers solely tofair value investigations, and only to ``temporary'' exchange-rate fluctuations.Even if Matsushita's and Victor's premise is true that the margins forperiod eight are due to exchange rate changes, the results of our periodeight review indicate that Matsushita and Victor have not adequately adjustedtheir U.S. and/or home market prices to account for the long-term appreciationof the yen against the dollar.<T3>Comment 76: </T3>Victor contends that, had it reported discount expenseson an allocated basis in accordance with traditional methodology, verificationof the Victor Shop discount and the cash discount programs would have beensuccessful. Victor blames the unsuccessful verification of these expenseson the Department for instructing Victor to report discounts on a sale-by-salebasis.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>At no time during the course of the fifthand eighth administrative reviews did the Department instruct Victor toreport its discounts on a sale-by-sale basis. Victor chose to report itsdiscounts on a monthly customer-specific basis, which it refers to as ``sale-by-sale.''Respondents must be able to support their claims at the level of detailreported in their questionnaire responses. In this case Victor was unableto do so.<T3>Comment 77: </T3>Victor contends that the verification report is wrongin stating that Victor failed to provide an adequate explanation of thedocumentation it presented to support its Victor Shop Discount claim forthe fifth and eighth review periods. Victor claims that this error arosebecause the Commerce verifier did not recollect the detailed explanationsprovided by Victor at verification. Victor also asserts that it had additionaldocuments available at verification that would have substantiated the sale-specificVictor Shop claim, but these documents were not requested or reviewed byCommerce at that time.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Victor did not provide adequate explanationsfor the documents presented at verification to support the claimed VictorShop discount adjustment. Further, Victor did not supply Commerce verifierswith additional information when requested at verification; only subsequentto verification and the preliminary results notice did Victor submit newexplanations and documents concerning this program. The new explanationsdo not correspond to the information provided in the original or supplementaryquestionnaire responses. Because the information was new, we consideredit untimely submitted. Therefore, we did not use it in these final results.<T3>Comment 78: </T3>Victor contends that the verification report is wrongin stating that Victor failed to provide adequate support documentationfor the claimed cash discount adjustment.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>At verification Victor provided informationto support a total cash discount as shown on its Pandamp;L. However, thecompany did not provide any supporting evidence for the customer-specificcash discount it reported in its computer submission. <T3>See </T3>our response to Comment 76.In its prehearing brief Victor submitted customer-specific cash discountbackup data for the first time. The Department did not request this information.Moreover, to the extent that new information was submitted subsequent toverification and the preliminary results, it is untimely and we have notconsidered it in these final results.<T3>Comment 79: </T3>Victor disputes the Department's decision to disallowcertain portions of Victor's claimed home market advertising expenses.The company claims that the Department's failure to verify certain portionsof this expense was based on the Department's incorrect assertion thatno supporting documentation was provided by Victor.Victor asserts that it presented extensive, convincing, and well-prepareddocumentation which fully proved the portions of advertising expenses onwhich the verifiers chose to focus. The Department's failure to test otherportions of Victor's expenses should not serve as a basis for denying Victor'sclaim.Victor further alleges that the Department did not request informationat verification that the Department subsequently claimed to have requestedand not received. At the same time, Victor purports to have had documentationprepared to support other claims which the verifiers neglected to request.In its prehearing brief Victor detailed the trace performed at verificationand submitted new information to supplement its previous explanations.Victor concludes that all pertinent expenses were more than adequatelyverified and that, at that time, the Department clearly conveyed the impressionthat advertising claims were completely verified. In its prehearing briefVictor also included an affidavit from the company official who presentedVictor's advertising expense adjustment at verification.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Portions of Victor's advertising expenseadjustment were justifiably disallowed. The verification report notes thatsatisfactory support for the majority of the claimed advertising expenseswas lacking, despite repeated requests from the verifiers.The Department's practice during a verification is to spot-check portionsof submitted information and to consider the results of its check as dispositiveof the entire claim. Among the various portions of the advertising adjustmentwhich we sought to spot-check, Victor furnished adequate supporting evidenceonly for the amount incurred by the Corporate Advertising and Public RelationsDepartment and transferred (on the books) to the TV Division. At no timedid we indicate that we considered the entire advertising claim as verifiedbecause the Corporate Advertising and Public Relations Department's expenseswere verified. We did not focus only on these expenses; rather, our attemptsto spot-check other expenses in a reasonable amount of time were impededby the company's slow progress in producing supporting evidence. In theend, too many discrepancies remained for more than a minor portion of theclaimed expenses to be considered verified.Throughout the verification, the verifiers requested that Victor produceany documents the company had prepared for verification purposes. In someinstances the verification of certain claims was postponed because Victorhad not yet finished the preparations called for in the Department's verificationoutline. If Victor had additional information prepared specifically forverification, it had an affirmative responsibility to present it. As forthe new information submitted in the affidavit attached to Victor's prehearingbrief, it is untimely, and we have not considered it for this final determination.<T3>Comment 80: </T3>Victor argues that the Department should not havedisallowed Victor's sales promotion claim. Victor points out that the Departmentstated that the verification results for advertising expenses would bedispositive of its sales promotion claim. Since advertising expenses werefully verified, it follows that sales promotion claim should have beenallowed.On the other hand, Victor argues, if the Department does not agree thatadvertising expenses were fully verified, those expenses should not beconsidered dispositive of its sales promotion claim. Victor contends thatit provided materials that independently prove the accuracy of Victor'shome market sales promotion expenses.Victor contests the verification report's reference to the materials submittedin support of Victor's sales promotion claims as unexplained, untranslated,or unusable. Victor maintains that both the materials and the methodologyto trace them were explained in detail. Victor contends that, in any event,the Department has no basis on which to disallow the sales promotion expensesof the sales companies because the allegedly unverified portions of Victor'sadvertising expenses were all incurred by Victor, not by the sales companies.The sales promotion expenses incurred by the sales companies can be tracedto their consolidated Pandamp;L which was used to verify other expenses.Therefore, the sales companies' sales promotion expenses cannot reasonablybe disallowed.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>At verification the Department informedVictor that the verification of its sales promotion claim would be dependenton the success or failure of the verification of the claimed advertisingexpenses. In addition, Victor was informed that the sales promotion materialswould have to be fully translated for the Department's verifiers to considerthem upon their return to Washington.Because Victor failed to substantiate most of its advertising claim toour satisfaction, the Department denied Victor's entire claimed sales promotionadjustment. When the verification of one adjustment is meant to be dispositiveof another, we do not consider the latter adjustment verified if the formeris not fully and satisfactorily verified.Additionally, we note that even if we had wished to review the sales promotionclaim independently of the advertising claim, we would still have disallowedit because the materials submitted to support sales promotion were nottranslated and were unusable as supporting evidence.<T3>Comment 81: </T3>Victor argues that the Department incorrectly includeda hypothetical ``internal interest'' expense in the cost of productionCOP and CV of certain home market models. According to Victor, this expense,as evidenced by the books and records of the VCJ TV Division (TVD), isa theoretical expense which does not reflect any real economic cost incurredby the TVD in the production of televisions. While this expense does appearin the TVD's manufacturing expense accounts, it was deducted by VCJ indetermining the TVD's overall profits and losses.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The Department included ``internal interest''expense (interest on inventory and interest on fixed assets accounts) inits calculation of COP and CV because this expense is recorded in the TVDmanufacturing overhead expenses and is, therefore, part of the cost ofmanufacturing COM.Although at verification Victor claimed that these expenses are theoreticaland should therefore be deducted from product cost, Victor did not supportits argument. Nor did Victor explain or demonstrate that these expensesare deducted before determining the TVD's profit. Only in its prehearingbrief for the first time did Victor explain that these expenses are deductedin line 10 (``budget adjustment'') of the Pandamp;L. However, line 10 didnot equal the exact amount of the ``internal interest,'' indicating thatother adjustments are also reflected in that line. Victor provided no furtherdetail. Victor's explanation of the method used to deduct internal interestin its own books is untimely and incomplete. Because ``internal interest''is captured in COM, we have included it in our calculations for the finaldetermination.<T3>Comment 82: </T3>Victor argues that the local enterprise tax is anincome-based tax which is unrelated to COP and, therefore, should not beincluded in the general expenses used to calculate the COP and CV of homemarket models.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree. We have excluded the local enterprisetax from general expenses for purposes of calculating COP and CV for thefinal determination.<T3>Comment 83: </T3>Victor asserts that the Department erred in its calculationof CV for models C-1483UM, C-1326, and C-1446, by adding both U.S. andhome market packing material costs, rather than by replacing home marketpacking material costs with U.S. packing material costs.Victor also claims that the Department further erred by failing to makean addition to USP for the labor cost of packing. Victor contends thatthis error resulted from the Department's failure to understand that bothpacking material and packing labor costs are already included in the COMof these products.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We have reviewed our CV calculations andwe agree that packing material costs were inadvertently included twice.We have corrected our calculations for the final determination accordingly.With respect to the addition of packing labor costs to USP, Victor is mistaken.We did not add these costs to USP because they are already included inUSP. In accordance with section 772(d)(1)(A) of the statute we make anaddition to USP for packing costs only when they are not already includedin USP. For the final determination we have adjusted CV by replacing homemarket packing material and labor costs with U.S. packing material andlabor costs.<T3>Comment 84: </T3>Victor asserts that to be consistent with past agencypractice, the Department should have added all nonoperating expenses anddeducted all nonoperating income as an offset in calculating GSandamp;A forpurposes of CV. Victor argues that the Department should not have disallowedentire categories of the company's nonoperating income and offset certainother categories of nonoperating income only up to the level of nonoperatingexpenses associated with those categories.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. Our established practice hasbeen to disallow claims for credits from nonoperational revenue that cannotbe directly related to sales of the product under review or current operations.Thus we did not include Victor's non-sales-related income in its productioncosts.The Department noted at verification that the nonoperating income reportedby Victor included interest income on deposits, dividends, and securities,all of which were long-term. In addition, Victor reported royalty incomeunrelated to TVs and rents received from related parties for the leaseof equipment and buildings. As none of these categories is related to salesof the product under review or current operations, this income was excludedfrom production costs. <T3>(See Results of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value,Certain Fresh Cut Flowers from Colombia, The Asociacion Colombiana de Exportadoresde Flores </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>Consolidated Court No. 87-04-00622, Slip Op. 89-3.)<T3>Comment 85: </T3>Victor contends that in calculating CV the Departmentshould have made a circumstance-of-sale adjustment for home market transportationcosts (inland freight) because the Department included them in the SGandamp;Aportion of the CV.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>In our preliminary calculations, home markettransportation costs incurred by both Victor and its sales subsidiarieswere incorrectly included in general expenses for purposes of CV. We havecorrected our calculations for the final determination.<T3>Comment 86: </T3>Victor argues that in calculating FMV for models C-1483UM,C-1326, and C-1446, the Department should have made a circumstance-of-saleadjustment for advertising and sales promotion because these expenses wereincluded in the general expenses used to calculate CV. Victor contendsthat the success or failure of these claims at verification for price-to-priceadjustments should not affect their validity as adjustments to CV.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.15,differences in circumstances of sale for which allowances will be madeare limited, in general, to those circumstances which bear a direct relationshipto the sales under consideration. Victor incurred advertising and salespromotion expenses in the normal course of business, but at verificationit could demonstrate that only a portion of its claimed advertising expenseswere direct selling expenses. For this final determination we have includedadvertising and sales promotion expenses in general expenses in our calculationof COP and CV. We have allowed only the verified portion of advertisingexpenses as a circumstance-of-sale adjustment to FMV.<T3>Comment 87: </T3>Victor contends that the Department improperly usedU.S. expense experience in adjusting FMV for model C-1483UM. Since theDepartment used home market selling expenses in calculating CV of thismodel, Commerce should also have used home market expense data to calculatecircumstance-of-sale adjustments to FMV. Such adjustments could be readilycalculated as a percentage of CV and applied to FMV on this basis.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree in part. The Department inadvertentlydeducted U.S. direct selling expenses from the CV of model C-1483 in itscalculation of FMV. However, because there were no home market sales ofthis model, and therefore no direct selling expenses associated with theCV, we should not have made any circumstance-of-sale adjustments in calculatingFMV. We have corrected our calculations for these final results and haveonly allowed an adjustment for home market indirect selling expenses upto the amount of the U.S. indirect selling expenses.<T3>Comment 88: </T3>Victor contends that the Department improperly disallowedits commodity tax claim and instead substituted its own formula for calculatinghome market commodity tax. In so doing, the Department inadvertently usedan incorrect transfer price for home market model CX-60.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>At verification Victor declined to explainwhich of the five possible tax methodologies were used to derive the weighted-averagetax base for the home market models under review or for TVs in general.In lieu of this explanation Victor offered to submit a certificate fromthe Japanese tax authorities to confirm the model-specific tax amount paidduring the period of review. Victor later provided tax returns and statementslisting aggregate amounts (not model-specific amounts) of taxes paid toseveral area tax authorities; these were mere duplicates of documents alreadyprovided at verification.Since Victor failed to provide adequate information to support its model-specificcommodity tax claim, we relied on best information available. For periodsfive and eight the Department calculated a home market commodity tax amountfor the models under review by applying the 15% tax rate to a home marketmodel tax base. The tax base we used was each model's transfer price adjustedfor packing, inland freight, and brokerage/handling expenses.We agree that in our calculations for period eight we inadvertently usedthe wrong transfer price for model CX-60. However, after correcting forthis error and recalculating the commodity tax, we decided to use the amountclaimed by Victor because it is adverse to Victor as best information available.In our preliminary analysis for both reviews, we inadvertently omittedthe programming language that determines the per-model tax amount mostadverse to Victor. We have corrected our final calculations accordingly.<T3>Comment 89: </T3>Victor contends that the Department twice deductedfrom USP an imputed financing expense for time on the water, once as imputedinterest and once as part of the inventory carrying cost. Victor claimsthis error arose because the Department failed to account for the factthat merchandise enters JVC's inventory (Victor's related U.S. subsidiary)before it leaves Japan for the US. In other words, Victor considers merchandisein transit already to be part of JVC's U.S. inventory.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Victor's questionnaire response containedno information relating to imputed interest or inventory carrying cost.At verification, pursuant to the Department's verification outline, Victorprovided the Department with shipping schedules and a worksheet showingmonthly opening and closing inventory balances with which to calculatethese expenses. At that time Victor did not inform the Department thatthe inventory period included ocean transit, nor was this apparent fromthe worksheet. This information was supplied for the first time in Victor'sprehearing brief.We consider as untimely any new information submitted by a respondent subsequentto verification and the preliminary results. Therefore, we have not recalculatedimputed interest for the final determination. We will not allow respondentsto selectively submit new explanations to their advantage after verificationunless the explanations can be supported without additional information.<T3>Comment 90: </T3>Victor contends that the Department erred by treatingthe U.S. warranty labor expenses incurred by a related service companyas direct adjustments to USP, while at the same time treating related-partyhome market warranty labor expenses as indirect expenses in calculatingFMV. Victor argues that the Department must treat these costs as indirectexpenses in both markets.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Victor did not identify or quantify whichportions of its claimed U.S. warranty labor expenses were attributableto related or unrelated service contractors. Therefore, as best informationavailable we considered the full U.S. warranty labor expenses to be directselling expenses and adjusted USP accordingly.Because all home market warranty repairs are performed by service contractorsrelated to Victor, and in the absence of information that would demonstratethe arms-length nature of these expenses, we considered the labor portionof this warranty claim to be a fixed cost, not directly related to thesales under consideration. Therefore, we treated home market warranty laborcosts as indirect selling expenses and included them in the ESP offset.<T3>Comment 91: </T3>Victor contends that the Department erred in its calculationof theoretical home market credit expenses and inventory carrying costsfor models CX-60, C-1446, and C-1326, by double-counting them. Victor requeststhat the Department eliminate the theoretical adjustments it added to FMVand USP.The company argues that by capturing actual interest expenses in GSandamp;A,the Department accounts for ``actual interest expenses paid to unrelatedparties (i.e., to banks in connection with loans).'' In its prehearingbrief Victor claims that these loans finance its inventory and accountsreceivable; production costs associated with inventory are financed throughthese loans and Victor uses the cash flow provided by the loans to maintainits operations while awaiting payment for credit sales.Victor claims that in adjusting FMV and USP for these actual interest expenses,while also adjusting for theoretical home market credit and inventory carryingcosts, the Department double-counted Victor's interest expenses relatedto television sales.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree. To prevent any double-countingof expenses, we have deducted interest expenses from Victor's general expenses.<T3>See </T3>our position on Comment 14 for further discussion of thisissue.Final Results of the ReviewAs a result of our review of the comments received and the correction ofcertain clerical errors, we have determined that the following marginsexist:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,tp0,i1,s15,5,r50,5</C> <H1>Manufacturer </H1><H1>Review No. </H1><H1>Period of Review </H1><H1>Margin (percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Funai Electric <D>9 </D><D>04/01/87 to 02/29/88 </D><D>*21.93</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Matsushita <D>3 </D><D>04/01/81 to 03/31/82 </D><D>0.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>4 </D><D>04/01/82 to 03/31/83 </D><D>0.00</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>5 </D><D>04/01/83 to 08/18/83 </D><D>0.85</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>8 </D><D>03/01/86 to 02/28/87 </D><D>26.94</D><ITAG tagnum="1">NEC <D>9 </D><D>03/01/87 to 02/29/88 </D><D>16.32</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toshiba <D>4 </D><D>04/01/82 to 03/31/83 </D><D>0.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Victor <D>3 </D><D>04/01/81 to 03/31/82 </D><D>0.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>4 </D><D>04/01/82 to 03/31/83 </D><D>0.00</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>5 </D><D>04/01/83 to 08/18/83 </D><D>0.43</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>8 </D><D>03/01/86 to 02/28/87 </D><D>19.24</D><F>* No shipments during the period; rate from last review in which therewere shipments.</F></ITAG>The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess antidumpingduties on all appropriate entries.
