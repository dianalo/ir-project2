The administration ``is unable to guarantee that the Aegissystem would be protected from compromise through espionage once ithas left the direct control of the U.S. Navy,'' Rep. Charles E.Bennett, D-Fla., told the House Foreign Affairs arms control andAsia-Pacific subcommittees.   Congress was formally notified June 6 the administration hadapproved the sale of one Aegis system costing $526 million duringthe current fiscal year, with promise of a second system next yearand more purchases in the 1990s.   Aegis is the U.S. Navy's latest integrated shipboard air defensesystem, designed to track, select and fire on multiple incomingtargets.   Senior Defense and State department officials staunchly defendedthe proposed sale at the hearing, arguing that blocking it woulddamage U.S. credibility and cooperation with Japan on vital defensestrategy in the Western Pacific.   ``I can think of no single action on our part which would domore to call into question the basic aims or our security policy inthe Pacific region than to say that we have decided not to proceedweith the Aegis sale to Japan,'' said Assistant Secretary of StateGaston Sigur.   Sigur termed the sale ``critical in enabling Japan to fullyassume'' the role of defending its home region in the jointU.S.-Japanese plan for security in the Western Pacific. ``To denythis sale would undercut our policy of encouraging enhancedJapanese military spending,'' he said.   Bennett said Aegis-equipped U.S. warships remaining underAmerican command should perform the missions planned by theJapanese.   Assistant Defense Secretary Richard Armitage said Japan hasrepeatedly rejected, as recently as last week, demands of somemembers of Congress that its future Aegis-equipped destroyers beAmerican-made.   Had the administration insisted on this, he said, ``we wouldhave succeeded only in killing Aegis as a Japanese option ... itwould not be politically feasible in Japan for approval ofprocurement of an Aegis ship if the hull were built in the UnitedStates.''   But Rep. Helen Bentley, R-Md., said she has inside informationthat ``Japan wants the Aegis system so badly that she will take itany way she can get it _ even to the point of buying the wholepackage from the U.S.''   Ms. Bentley, a former chairwoman of the U.S. MaritimeCommission, charged that the Japanese and other foreignshipbuilders want to destroy the American shipbuilding industry,now suffering from dwindling orders.   Accusing the State Department of ignoring ``the rough-and-tumbleworld of profit and loss,'' Ms. Bentley said proposals such as theAegis sale could lead to a situation where ``within 10 years wewill have to buy our warships from them (Japan) because we will nothave the capability of building them ourselves any more ....''   She and Bennett also suggested that through a process of``reverse engineering,'' Japanese purchasers could learn the Aegistechnology once the system was transferred.   Sigur and Armitage said the Japanese government, as opposed toprivate companies, had an impeccable record of safeguardingsensitive U.S. technology.</TEXT></DOC>
