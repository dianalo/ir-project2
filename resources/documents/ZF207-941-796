(Mountain View, CA), a relatively new firm -- but one with a newspin on some technology proven in custom government text-retrieval.andM;Verity was founded in 1988 as a spin-off of Advanced Decision Systems (ADS),a company that specializes in custom program and system development for thegovernment.andP;  During the 1980s ADS got involved in some text-retrievalassignments -- and became convinced there was a better way to do it.andP;  Veritywas founded in order to commercialize their solution.andM;Fast out of the blocksandM;With help from ADS, then, Verity came out of the blocks very fast.andO;Incorporated in April 1988, it obtained $3 million in venture money in June1988, and was shipping versions of its software, called TOPIC, by July 1988.andO;Its second version of the software was introduced in June of this year.andP;  Bythen the company had raised $9.4 million in venture capital, brought on asenior management team, including as chairman and president, Dr. Michael S.andO;Pliner, one of the founders and chief executives of Sytek, a local areanetwork company.andM;With TOPIC Verity tries to simplify the search process by putting more energyinto the query formation with the help of a different query methodology andby using a distributed client-server approach to overall systemsarchitecture.andM;To begin with, the documents themselves are maintained on their nativedatabases -- on micros, minis, or mainframes -- and in their native formats.andO;Special software takes information from each database -- title, dates,descriptive pointers -- and puts it into a database that gets on a networkserver.andP;  Also on the server is a retrieval engine which takes a userinformation request -- called a topic -- and generates a list of requesteddocuments.andM;Uses concepts, not wordsandM;Topics, which are outlines of concepts rather than Boolean connectedkey-words, are built on the client side of the network with the help of atopic editor and profiler.andP;  Users don't really need to know how the documentsare searched -- only what it is, in a general way, what they're looking for,and the relative value of topic attributes.andP;  Topics -- the basic constructsof the queries -- can be stored and refined over time.andM;Boiled down, users build outlines, not queries, and the network andclient-server software does the rest.andP;  According to Verity, the architectureallows the system to search more documents and to score a better hit ratethan the traditional mainframe-based systems.andM;In one study conducted by Verity, a standard Boolean search found 38% of thedocuments retrieved were actually relevant, while 90% were under TOPIC whenthe concepts were weighted.andP;  Perhaps even more important, the TOPIC system isbetter at not missing relevant documents.andM;Finally, the distributed architecture of the system means that users canstart viewing documents before the search is complete.andP;  The TOPICarchitecture allows for not only faster and more efficient searches, but alsosearches that might never be attempted otherwise.andM;Designed to use latest technologyandM;TOPIC is built from the ground up with networked computers and relationaldatabases in mind.andP;  And Verity has the gusto -- meaning almost $10 million inventure backing and an experienced management team -- with which it'sattacking the market.andM;There's no way to tell for certain whether the market will grow as big and asfast as IDC says.andP;  Text retrieval may still be hobbled by its pastassociations -- with the complexity of standard Boolean search techniques,and with technologies such as micrographics and mainframe-based wordprocessing.andP;  Even if the new systems like those offered by Verity are fast,cheap, and easy to use, it's going to take some missionary work to convincepeople that full-text retrieval is the way to go.andP;  If the Boolean specialistsfeel threatened by these radical techniques, then the market may be slowedeven more.andM;But if we are to live and operate in a world of compound documents, and ifthe number of documents keeps growing at the current compound rate (punintended), then we'll need a new way to haul them out of their databases andfigure out what's in them.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
