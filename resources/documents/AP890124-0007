More than 5 million people, about one-third of the population,have left Afghanistan since the Moslem insurgency began after aCommunist coup in April 1978.   By official count, just 188,000 have come back in the year sincethe Soviet-backed government proclaimed ``national reconciliation''and offered enticements to refugees who return, including asix-month exemption from military service.   With the deadline for Soviet withdrawal approaching and no peacein sight, even that trickle is slowing.   Red Army soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and anestimated 115,000 were in the country when the withdrawal began May15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement. Half had left by Aug. 15 and allare to be gone by Feb. 15.   Afghan officials accuse Pakistani bureaucrats and insurgentleaders of siphoning off international aid intended for the refugeecamps.   ``That Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, he's got 300 cars. ... It's from themoney for the camps,'' Mirkhall Jalla, deputy minister forrepatriation, said of one leaders of the seven-party guerrillaalliance based in Pakistan.   ``Pakistan, Iran, the opposition parties; they prevemt them(refugees) from coming by force, with guns, and they plant landmines on the border,'' he said. ``Without the refugees they havenothing.''   Jalla denied reports of government bribes to returning refugees,particularly young men wanted for the army.   He insisted in an interview that the regime of President Najibasks no questions of returning refugees and would take no reprisalsagainst guerrillas or sympathizers who come home under the program.   Even if the guerrillas believe that, they still are fighting theSoviets and the Najib government, with aid that comes primarily fromthe United States and Pakistan.   Because the insurgents control most of the countryside, familieswho fled villages devastated by Soviet and Afghan bombing raidswould return under guerrilla auspices.   For such peasant families, fear of mines and of continuing warafter the Soviet withdrawal are major deterrents to repatriation.Millions of mines have been planted in a decade of war.   The map in Jalla's office has a look of unreality. Some of thecolored buttons marking 28 government reception centers for refugeesare well within guerrilla territory.   Nearly all refugees who reach the capital are from Iran,Afghanistan's western neighbor. Kabul's guest house has room for 700people, but often is empty.   The refugees' tales are similar: flight from war, hearing aboutthe repatriation plan and paying other Afghan exiles to take them tothe border. Young men, speaking through an official interpreter,told a reporter they would be willing to join the army after thesix-month exemption.   Hashem, 18, said he was barely 10 when he and an uncle fled toPakistan, then Iran, from their village in the central province ofOruzgan. He is illiterate, has had no contact with his parents andsaid longing for them caused his return.   ``I heard there was a new policy,'' he said. ``I wanted to comehome. I want to see my parents. I'll go into the army when theysay.''   No one at the Kabul center knew whether Hashem's parents werealive.   The U.N. refugee agency, known as the High Commissioner forRefugees, established a Kabul office in June but Dutch directorReinout Wanrooy said: ``There really isn't much we can do.   ``Our expectation was that people might come back in largenumbers this spring, or before. Now we think they might wait anotheryear. But if things get worse after the Soviets leave, the refugeeproblem in Pakistan may get worse.''   Both Pakistan and the insurgents seem opposed to the return ofrefugees, partly because the Afghan mountain fighters are moreeffective without families who need protection and are in danger ofair or artillery attack.   Little aid is available for Afghans returning home. Most Westernnations refuse to deal with Najib and expect his government to fallafter Soviet forces are gone. His government says its program couldhandle a million people, but that seems doubtful in a desperatelypoor nation devastated by war.   The Soviet Union made the major contribution, $600 million, to a$1.1 billion rehabilitation fund set up by the United Nations. Butmost of that is in blankets and tents, not money.   Afghan officials say the equivalent of about $5 million alreadyhas been spent to bring back refugees, including compensation forseized or destroyed property.</TEXT></DOC>
