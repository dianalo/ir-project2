The legislation, which was passed by Parliament Friday, also provides for appointment of an arbitrator in the contract dispute, which involves more than 47,000 unionized workers at Canada's two major railroads, government-owned Canadian National Railways and CP Rail, a unit of Montreal-based Canadian Pacific Ltd.    The strike, which lasted six days, was called by a group of nine rail unions after contract negotiations became deadlocked over job security and other issues. While freight operations resumed Saturday, passenger services weren't expected to be back to normal until today.    The Conservative government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said that if the strike were allowed to continue it would seriously hurt the Canadian economy. About a third of Canada's freight moves by rail.    It was the first rail strike in Canada since 1973. The rail workers have been without a contract since Dec. 31. </TEXT></DOC>
