The FDIC lost $4billion in 1990, depleting its fund to $9 billion, and itexpects to lose another $5 billion in 1991.   No one, perhaps least of all the banking industry, wantsto ask the taxpayers to shore up the FDIC unless the problemsbecome insurmountable. This has led to a plethora ofproposals to require the banks to recapitalize the FDIC.</LP><TEXT>   The leading proposal is to impose a special assessmentagainst the banks equal to 1% of insured deposits, perhapspayable in up to five annual installments of 0.2% each. Thiswould be in addition to the &quot;normal&quot; deposit insurancepremium, which itself has increased nearly fivefold since1985.   A special assessment of anything approaching thismagnitude would be the wrong medicine at the wrong time forboth the banking system and the economy. Bank loans fuel theeconomy, and bank capital is required to support the loans.The 1% special assessment would transfer to the governmentroughly $25 billion in private bank capital -- capital thatotherwise would be available to support well over $300billion in bank lending.   The folly of the special assessment is compounded by thefact that there's no clear evidence that the FDIC needs theextra $25 billion. The FDIC's revenue over the next two yearswill be approximately $12 billion. When this revenue is addedto the FDIC's current fund balance, the FDIC will have some$21 billion available to handle bank failures.   It's actually a misnomer to refer to the &quot;fund.&quot; Inreality there is no fund. Banks have been paying premiums tothe FDIC since 1934. The FDIC turns these funds over to theTreasury, where they are commingled with other tax revenuesand spent on missiles, welfare payments and the like. If theFDIC requires funds to handle a bank failure, it notifiesTreasury, which then borrows money in the financial marketsto meet the FDIC's needs. A running balance is kept todetermine whether the banks have paid more to the FDIC thanthe FDIC has spent. For most of the FDIC's existence apositive balance has been accumulating, to be used indifficult times such as these.   Most economists believe the Federal Reserve Board turnedan ordinary recession into the Great Depression byrestricting the money supply. Draining capital from analready strained banking system to support the FDIC would bean almost equivalent policy blunder.   My preference is to not increase FDIC premiums at all inthe current environment. I would wait until the economy andthe banking system recover from their current woes and thenincrease premiums to whatever level is necessary to rebuildthe fund to an appropriate level.   Assuming this approach is not politically acceptable, thenext best alternative is to put the FDIC fund on apay-as-you-go basis. The FDIC should estimate its projectedlosses each year and set bank premiums at a level that willcause the FDIC to break even. Once the problems are behind usthe FDIC can undertake to rebuild the fund.   Some might argue that the public wants to be able to see alarge insurance fund, capable of handling every reasonablecontingency. This contention has two flaws. First, even a $25or $30 billion fund is not likely to be reassuring whenvarious &quot;experts&quot; are claiming the fund faces losses of $60billion or more. Second, it's not the size of the fund thatcomforts the public, but the commitment of the government toput the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury behind thefund.   While the FDIC's solvency can be handled through slightlyincreased premiums, the fund has a liquidity problem that ismore troublesome. Much of the FDIC's cash is tied up in loansand other assets taken over from failed banks -- assets thatwill require years to liquidate. The FDIC needs to be able toborrow money from some source to meet its liquidityrequirements. A substantial increase in the FDIC's $5 billionline from the Treasury appears warranted. No taxpayer subsidywould be involved, because the borrowings would bearinterest.   Another alternative that should be explored is to makeavailable to the FDIC loans from the Federal Reserve Systemin an amount equal to the noninterest-bearing reserves thatbanks must maintain at the Federal Reserve (roughly $20billion). I would argue, though perhaps unsuccessfully, thatthe Federal Reserve funds should be advanced to the FDICwithout interest because they are obtained from the bankingindustry without interest.   The FDIC fund's condition is distracting policymakers fromthe considerably more important and urgent subject of how toamend the outmoded laws that have so weakened the bankingsystem. It's time to move the debate along.   ---   Mr. Isaac, chairman of the FDIC from 1981 through 1985, ismanaging director of the Secura Group, a financial consultingfirm in Washington, D.C.</TEXT></DOC>
