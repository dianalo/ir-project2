This approach allows a minimum TEof 5 msec. The sequence will be applicable to imaging of nuclei withcharacteristic short T2, including F-19, Na-23, and P-31. There is arestriction on the minimum section thickness obtainable and on the digitalresolution. However, these limitations are not severe for imaging ofnuclei of low concentrations. The imaging sequence the authors developedincludes a nonselective 180{sup 0} pulse following the volume-selective90{sup 0} pulse. Some degradation of image quality will arise due toinhomogeneity of the B/sub 1/ field over the image volume. They compensatedfor this by using a solenoid imaging coil that possesses excellent B/sub1/ homogeneity and allows maximum sensitivity.</TEXT></DOC>
