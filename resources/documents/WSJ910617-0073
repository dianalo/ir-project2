We have no doubt that Mr. Bush wants to cut red tape,but in practice his administration is creating it. To put itbaldly, the Bush presidency is reversing many of thederegulatory gains Mr. Bush helped promote as vice presidentin the 1980s.   At the Food and Drug Administration, David Kessler is on acrusade against orange juice labels while THA, the only drugever to show evidence of relieving Alzheimer's disease,languishes in his bureaucracy. OSHA and the FTC -- twonotorious federal nannies -- are also back harassingbusiness. &quot;Wetlands&quot; that aren't even wet have been declaredoff limits to development, creating a nationwide backlash.And so on.   According to the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations,agencies are churning out 17% more rules than in the 1980s.And that's before including the wave of new regulations nowbeing produced to implement the Clean Air Act, thedisabilities act and other bills Mr. Bush likes to takepolitical credit for.   How is one to explain this result set against Mr. Bush'slongstanding criticism of regulatory red tape?   A large part of the problem is the quiet crippling of theWhite House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs(OIRA). This is the office, created under Jimmy Carter, thatreviews regulations to avoid such classics as the OSHA rulerequiring that hard hats worn at industrial sites be&quot;disinfected.&quot; Hard hats have never been known to transmitdisease, but OSHA still wanted to impose the $60 millioncost. OIRA stopped it.   The point isn't that all regulations are absurd, but thatsomeone needs to provide a sanity check. Yet the top OIRA jobhas been vacant for 18 months under Mr. Bush. (Liberals seemto believe that &quot;independent&quot; agencies are inherentlyincapable of doing economic harm and therefore need not beaccountable.)   Republican Senator Bob Kasten of Wisconsin is proposing toreinvigorate OIRA through the &quot;Paperwork Reduction Act of1991.&quot; He's got support from a bipartisan group of Senators,including such Democrats as Georgia's Sam Nunn, Dale Bumpersof Arkansas, Alan Dixon of Illinois and Max Baucus ofMontana. The bill might pass with presidential support, butthe White House is strangely mute.   In particular, Mr. Bush's support is needed to overcomethe political extortion practiced by OIRA's main opponents --Ohio Senator John Glenn and his deputy, Leonard Weiss. Thepair have put a hold on a planned Bush appointee in the hopeof extorting a &quot;compromise&quot; from the White House that wouldgut OIRA. Budget Director Richard Darman is said to be readyto accept this defeat because the would-be nominee, FrankHodsoll, is his man.   This political hostage-taking, we should add, is a growingcongressional outrage. Last year Mr. Glenn held VanderbiltProf. James Blumstein hostage for so long that he finallygave up trying to come to Washington to run OIRA. BankingChairman Donald Riegle is currently delaying the confirmationof Lawrence Lindsey and David Mullins to Federal Reserveposts. Since Democrats may never again hold the presidency,they don't seem to care how much havoc they wreak in theexecutive branch.   Giving into Mr. Glenn on OIRA will just encourage moreextortion. More important, it would damage Mr. Bush'spresidential power by turning OIRA into the shell Mr. Glennwould like it to be. In particular, the Glenn &quot;compromise&quot;doesn't overturn a recent Supreme Court decision, Dole v.Steelworkers, that has let federal agencies write about athird of their rules in such a way as to dodge OIRAaltogether.   Senator Glenn wants to drive a wedge between the WhiteHouse and federal regulators to enhance Congress's ability tointervene. The Constitution's founders wrote about a&quot;unitary&quot; executive precisely because they wanted bureaucratsto be accountable to an elected President. Congress issupposed to write the laws, not administer them. But then Mr.Glenn is an expert in congressional interference withregulators, having lobbied them to go easy on Sandamp;L kingpinCharles Keating.   President Bush can fulfill his pledge to reduce red tapeonly with the help of a strong OIRA. Kasten-Nunn gives him achance to avoid the label of &quot;reregulation President.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
