The localauthorities are important in this as it was they who first received theCentral Electricity Generating Board's request to build Sizewell-B andwho triggered the need for a Public Inquiry. The local authorities didnot object in principle to the use of the Sizewell site for additionalnuclear power generation provided the Government was satisfied that therewas a national need for the extra capacity. In future inquiries theremight not be acceptance in principle which would change the nature ofthe Inquiry. The local authority involvement in the public inquiry isdiscussed under the headings: need and economics, safety and local environmentissues. The relevant parts of the Sizewell-B report are considered. TheSecretary of State's decision, which follows the Inspector's report,justifies the confidence put in the inquiry process by the local authorities.Concern is expressed, however, that extra financial help is needed topay for the local authorities expenditure on the Inquiry and also forthe consequences of the Sizewell-B project itself.
