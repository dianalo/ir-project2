Diocotron instabilityarises when hollow beam (or plasma bunch) propagates along strong (forelectrons the cyclotron frequency much higher than for plasma)externalmagnetic field. Under the effect of crossed fields - proper electricand external magnetic particle transverse drift occurs. Due to inhomogeneityof electric field the velocity shear arises which is the source of nonequilibriumstate. 2 refs.; 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
