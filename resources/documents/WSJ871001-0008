However, they said the inquiry was hampered by the ambiguity of Japanese law in defining insider trading.    The investigation focused on sales of more than two million Tateho shares in August by Nikko Securities Co. before the Sept. 2 disclosure of Tateho's nearly 28 billion yen ($191.3 million) loss in government bond futures trading.    The officials said the inquiry didn't find any transactions by securities company executives or major stockholders that would have violated Japan's Securities and Exchange Act in the days before the Tateho announcement.    The inquiry found that the Tateho selling was not concentrated in any particular region and that no spouses or relatives of Tateho executives sold shares, the officials said.    But they said the failure of the law to give a comprehensive definition of illegal insider trading left the exchange unable to draw any broader conclusions.    The exchange is to report its findings to the Ministry of Finance next week. Securities analysts say the ministry might draft an amendment to the Securities and Exchange Act to clarify the definition of insider trading. </TEXT></DOC>
