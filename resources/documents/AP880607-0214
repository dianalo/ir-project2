They urgedstudents to ``keep a sober mind.''   In front-page editorials, major official dailies accused somestudent leaders of being agitators trying to negate China's reformsand appealed to students to avoid the ``methods of anarchy.''   The planned Wednesday afternoon march to Tiananmen Square, thesymbolic political center of China, would be the first majorpolitical protest by students since the winter of 1986-1987.Nationwide student unrest then led to a conservative backlashagainst Western liberal ideas.   Hu Yaobang was removed as Communist Party chief for failing tostem the pro-democracy movement. The party purged several outspokenpolitical thinkers.   More than 1,000 students rallied from Tuesday night into earlyWednesday at Beijing University, China's leading university, tovoice demands for greater democracy, more press freedom, betterliving conditions for intellectuals and better campus security.   The turmoil was prompted by the June 2 slaying of a universitystudent in an off-campus brawl. Six non-students were arrested inthe death.   The killing brought to the surface student unhappiness over poorliving conditions on campus and bleak economic prospects aftergraduation for the nation's low-paid intellectuals.   Hundreds have gathered on the campus in the evenings forimpromptu debates on what broader lessons are to be learned from theincident.   Dozens of posters have gone up demanding democracy, a free press,an end to government corruption and petty bureaucracy and greaterrespect and higher salaries for intellectuals.   In an announcement Wednesday, the Beijing municipal governmentdenounced a ``handful of people with ulterior motives who have takenthe opportunity of this criminal case (the murder) to concoct rumorsand slander the reform and open policy in violation of the law, andsabotaging political stability and unity.''   It reminded students that all demonstrations without previousapproval from police are illegal. That regulation was imposed afterthe 1986-87 disturbances.</TEXT></DOC>
