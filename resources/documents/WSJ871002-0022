Garcia</HL><DD> 10/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices rallied yesterday as investor attention shifted away from the sagging U.S. dollar and weaker bond market and focused on the prospects for higher corporate profits.    Long-term Treasury bond prices rebounded from their lowest levels of the session, but still ended lower on the day, and the dollar lost ground against the major currencies. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 2639.20, posting a gain of 42.92 points.    &quot;Bonds weren't much of a contributor&quot; to yesterday's action, said Eugene Peroni, director of technical analysis with Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. &quot;That indicates that the market is very much centered on earnings&quot; right now because third-quarter reports are due in a few weeks and because the next-year prospects for many industries are good, he added. Several industry groups, including semiconductor, computer technology, paper, forest products and chemical issues, advanced on expectations of higher earnings.    Traders said some buying interest from foreign investors helped set the tone for the rally early on. The advance was fairly steady in the morning, but leveled off around midday and then picked up steam again in the last two hours of the session.    The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.50 to 327.33 and the New York Stock Exchange composite index advanced 2.73 to 182.97. Gainers had nearly a 2-to-1 lead over decliners on the Big Board as volume rose to 193.2 million shares from 183.1 million.    Fred Lange, president of Lange Financial Services, believes some portfolio managers were encouraged by the mere fact that the stock market has reversed its slide in the past week despite rising interest rates. He also noted that although the dollar fell slightly yesterday, it has rebounded from its recent low of 137 yen, providing some confidence that the U.S. unit is stabilizing.    He and other market professionals attributed some of yesterday's advance to the demand usually seen at the beginning of a new quarter, when managers get new funds to invest in the stock market. Also, there were rumors throughout the day that a major investor was switching a substantial position from bonds to stocks, which added spice to the rally, traders said.    The industrial average rose 1.6% yesterday, while the average stock on the Big Board (all issues being equally weighted) rose just 0.72%. Although the blue-chip stocks turned in the best performance, &quot;money was going into a broad array of stocks,&quot; said Steven Kroll, chief investment officer of Hutton Asset Management in New York. He noted that among the gainers were American Express, an interest-rate-sensitive issue; Philip Morris, a consumer-related stock, and International Paper, a cyclical issue.    National Semiconductor jumped 1 7/8 to 20 1/4 on more than 3.4 million shares, making it the most active issue on the Big Board. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission Wednesday completed their review of National's planned purchase of Schlumberger's Fairchild Semiconductor unit, allowing the two firms to complete the plan. Wall Street is bullish on the proposed acquisition, believing that National is buying Fairchild at a cheap price.    Traders said some of the interest in the semiconductor stocks was generated by rumors of a shortage of semiconductor chips. Smith Barney analyst James Barlage said there are no industrywide shortages that would be driving the stocks higher.    Mr. Barlage is bullish on the semiconductor industry as a whole because the normally slow summer months were stronger than expected, order activity looked good for September and the momentum is expected to continue into this quarter.    Texas Instruments rose 3 1/4 to 78; Motorola added 3 3/8 to 73 1/4 and Advanced Micro Devices gained 2 to 24. Computer technology and software stocks advanced. Paper, forest products and chemical issues were also among the gainers.    Traders said some insurance stocks fell back as the market was trying to assess the extent of the damage caused by the earthquake that hit Los Angeles yesterday morning. But many of the stocks recovered all or most of their early losses before the closing bell. American International Group was unchanged at 79 7/8 after trading as low as 78; Aetna eased 1/4 to 60 3/8; Travelers fell 1/4 to 45 1/8; Continental rose 1/4 to 45 1/2 and American General moved up 1/2 to 38 1/2.    CBS slid 5 to 220 3/4 after a delayed opening. After meeting yesterday, the broadcaster's directors will again consider the fate of the CBS record unit at their regular meeting Oct. 14. CBS stock had run up 9 3/4 Wednesday on speculation that the company was about to announce the sale of the record division to Sony Corp. of Japan.    Loews Corp., which is the largest holder of CBS stock, dropped 1 5/8 to 93 5/8.    IBP Inc.'s new shares were actively traded on the Big Board, with more than 2.4 million changing hands, but the price didn't budge from the initial offering price of $19. The shares were priced at the low end of the $19 to $22 price the company had hoped to get.    IBP is the meat processing unit of Occidental Petroleum. Occidental, whose stock eased 5/8 to 33 7/8, will still own about 53% of IBP after this offering of 21.5 million shares.    Newmont Mining lost 1 7/8 to 97 after a U.S. appeals court in San Francisco issued an injunction blocking T. Boone Pickens Jr.'s Ivanhoe Partners from continuing its $72-a-share tender offer for the company. Ivanhoe now has a 9.95% stake in Newmont and had offered $72 a share for 28 million additional shares.    Yesterday, a Delaware state court postponed until next week a decision on whether Consolidated Gold Fields PLC has to shed the recent stock purchases that increased its Newmont Mining stake to 49.7%. Attorneys for Ivanhoe Partners argued that there should have been competitive bidding for the shares that Gold Fields accumulated.    Kraft moved up 2 1/2 to 57 1/4. The consumer food concern may buy back as many as 10 million shares from time to time. American Brands rose 1 7/8 to 57 5/8. The food, beverage and tobacco concern said it plans to shed its Sunshine Biscuits and Pinkerton's subsidiaries. Other food and tobacco stocks were mostly higher.    Tribune Co. gained 3 1/2 to 48 1/8 after falling 3 1/4 Wednesday. Merrill Lynch reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock, saying it was among the most attractive companies in the media group.    Southern Co. added 7/8 to 23 1/8 in active trading. Southern plans to ask the Georgia Public Service Commission to reconsider its decision to grant its Georgia Power unit a $464 million rate increase, rather than the $735 million boost requested by the utility. The rate increase is to help pay for Georgia Power's Vogtle nuclear plant.    Universal Security Instruments was up 7/16 to 3 1/8 on the OTC market. The company plans to buy back as many as 400,000 of its common shares. </TEXT></DOC>
