The bill, approved by the Energy and Commerce telecommunicationsand finance subcommittee on a voice vote, would require theoperator-services companies to clearly identify themselves, providerates to callers, not charge for incompleted calls and ensure thatcredit-card callers are billed at their long-distance companies'rates if they so choose.   The bill was amended to force such companies to file a list oftheir prices with the Federal Communications Commission. If the FCCfinds a company's rates to be unreasonable, the company then mustjustify their charges.   The bill also would require the FCC to determine whether theoperator-services industry as a whole is charging just andreasonable rates. If not, the FCC would decide how to establishrate regulation for the industry.   The bill now goes to the full Energy and Commerce Committee,where it is expected to pass and be sent to the full House.   Operator-services companies typically lease long-distance linesfrom the major long-distance carriers and then contract with suchoperations as airports, motels, hospitals and schools to provideservice. In most cases, the companies pay airports and othercustomer a commission on each call handled from their phones.   The FCC has received 2,000 complaints about operator-servicescompanies, mostly regarding prices, which sometimes can be two orthree times the rates charged by the long-distance carriersthemselves.   But the FCC in February said there was not enough evidence thatcompanies were charging excessively and instead told the companiesto post their names and telephone numbers on pay phones, stopblocking callers from using the long-distance carrier of theirchoice and stop billing customers from cities other than where thecalls are made.   The House bill includes similar provisions. But Rep. MatthewRinaldo, R-N.J., said the bill also orders the pricinginvestigation because of the FCC's ``wholly inadequate'' responseto the raft of complaints.   The subcommittee chairman, Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said thebill was a response to ``a litany'' of complaints from consumers``who innocently picked up pay phones and made calls which resultedin charges 250 percent higher than their regular long-distancerates.''   ``For the first time in its 100-year history the public payphone has become an instrument of confusion and frustration,''Markey added. ``A constituent recently told me she was afraid touse her local phone booth because she did not know what to expectin her next month's phone bill. This morning's action should endthe fear and the guesswork.''</TEXT></DOC>
