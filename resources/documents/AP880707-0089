The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. LesAspin, D-Wis., had said after briefings by Pentagon officials thatthe presence of a second plane would explain why the officersaboard the USS Vincennes mistook the Iranian A300 Airbus for anF-14 fighter.   Aspin's comment raised speculation that an Iranian fighter mighthave been flying behind the Airbus, hoping to sneak up on theVincennes.   Pentagon spokesman Daniel Howard told reporters that ``the realmof possibility is fairly small on a phantom aircraft, on a secondaircraft.''   An Iranian P-3 Orion patrol plane was far to the north of theVincennes, along the northern shore of Qeshm Island, and twoIranian F-4 fighters took off from Bandar Abbas after the Airbuswas shot down, he said, but they played no role in the incident.   Previously, Pentagon officials had mentioned the P-3 and one ofthe F-4's, but they had not mentioned the second F-4.   The Aegis radar and tracking system aboard the Vincennes issophisticated enough to have detected any aircraft flying in tandemwith the Iranian jetliner, Howard said.   The equipment sends out a radar signal that would have beenthree miles high and wide and one mile deep at the point when theAirbus was nine miles away, the point at which the Vicennes firedSM-2 Standard missiles at it and knocked it down.   It would have been almost impossible for any other aircraft tohave been within that area, he said.   The plane was mistaken for an F-14, Howard said, because theAirbus was transmitting an identification signal on a frequencynormally reserved for military aircraft.   Howard also said that Iran should share some responsibility forthe downing of the plane because it took off from the jointmilitary and civilian airfield at Bandar Abbas during an exchangeof fire between the Vincennes and Iranian gunboats and was headedstraight at the Vincennes when it was shot down.   ``The Iranians are the ones who bear the resonsibility forensuring that if they are the ones who provoke the hostilities,they are the ones who began the shooting in this incident, thatthey ensure the safety of their civilian aircraft by not sendingthem into harm's way,'' Howard said.</TEXT></DOC>
