Saying Milken was not a threat to flee the country before anexpected trial, U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood denied thegovernment's request that Milken post $250 million in bail money.   In addition, Milken's brother Lowell, who also faces fraud andracketeering charges, agreed to set aside $50 million in assets inthe face of the racketeering statutes and was ordered to post a $1million bond secured by other assets.   The Milkens left the courthouse to applause from about 100supporters who attended the hearing, but did not comment.   The ruling means the Milkens will be free pending a trialprosecutors say is expected to last more than six months and shouldmark a high point in the government's nearly three-year crackdownon Wall Street fraud.   The Milkens and former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg werecharged in a 98-count racketeering and fraud indictment handed upMarch 29 that seeks some $1.8 billion in forfeitures.   Under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizationsact, the government could have sought to freeze all of thedefendants' assets before a trial as a guarantee they wouldn't sellor otherwise dilute them to avoid massive penalties if convicted.   The agreement announced at a Manhattan federal court hearingrequires Michael Milken to place $300 million cash in an account tobe monitored by the government and to sign a note securing $300million more in less liquid assets.   Milken also will have to surrender the gains from his holdingsin Drexel _ which total 6 percent of the investment firm and areestimated at about $100 million _ as soon as the firm's settlementof separate civil charges with the Securities and ExchangeCommission officially takes effect.   That deal announced Thursday resolves a range of separate civilcharges against Drexel and requires the Wall Street giant todismiss Milken, sever all business dealings with him and force himto give up his Drexel holdings.   ``In substance, your honor, we expect the security forforfeiture in this case will amount to $700 million,'' AssistantU.S. Attorney John K. Carroll said.   Flanked by a group of defense lawyers, Milken and his brotherattended the hearing but did not address the judge.   ``The defendants not only contest the indictment but theyseriously, expressly contest the government's theories onforfeiture,'' said Arthur L. Liman, Michael Milken's attorney.   Defense lawyers and prosecutors have grappled over the terms ofthe bond package since the long-awaited Milken indictment washanded up. The government reportedly initially sought $1 billion inpretrial asset holdings.   Milken, who reportedly made more than $1 billion between 1983and 1987, under the deal also is barred from transferring anyassets out of the country and must gradually sell assets to convertthe $300 million note to cash. Milken also surrendered his passport.   Carroll sought $250 million in bail, claiming the potentialracketeering forfeitures ``gives (the Milkens) powerful incentiveto absent themselves should they choose to do so.''   ``Should they flee to someplace where they could not beextradited, they could live comfortably the rest of their lives,''he said.   Liman asked Judge Wood to free Milken without having to makebail, saying he was a ``homebody'' who posed no threat to leave thecountry. If the Milkens had sought to flee, they would have done solong ago, their attorneys said.   Wood ruled that the brothers, who both have lived near LosAngeles most of their lives, were ``excellent candidates for bail''but she set $1 million bail for each of them because of the scopeof the indictment and the asset retention package.   The bond, which will be secured by other assets, must be postedby Monday.   Newberg, who also faces a racketeering indictment in a relatedcase, agreed to set aside $1.6 million in assets. He has yet notbeen arraigned because of a skiing injury and no bail terms wereset.   Michael Milken, 42, has been the main target of the government'scrackdown on white-collar crime. He is widely credited withreshaping corporate America in the 1980s through the sale ofhigh-yield junk bonds from Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., office.   The probe of Drexel and Milken is based in large part oninformation by jailed inside trader Ivan Boesky, whose revelationsstunned Wall Street in 1986. Boesky has completed one year of athree-year jail term.</TEXT></DOC>
