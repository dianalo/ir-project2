Ferguson, in vainly attempting to persuadeCalifornians to vote against their rail-bond issues (&quot;TheGolden State Assays the Golden Spike,&quot; Business World, June5), supports &quot;buses, jitneys and high-speed lanes for groupvehicles&quot; as alternatives to rail systems.   Jitneys and group vehicles, however, cannot handle a bigpart of urban-transportation demand without bogging down intheir own gridlock. The Asian cities known for jitneys nowhave rail systems, too.</LP><TEXT>   And many potential rail commuters won't ride a bus. Thefare box covers only 30% of the operating costs of themuch-touted Shirley Highway buses vs. Washington Metro's 75%,Philadelphia-Lindenwold's 85% and San Diego Trolley's 95%.   Mr. Ferguson's column included a Department ofTransportation table comparing projected and actual ridershipon new rail systems. The table misses the point. Rail systemsare built for the long term. Who cares now how many rodeBoston's first subway when it was two years old?   Moreover, ridership on most of the cited systems has risensince the Department of Transportation went to press.Sacramento is up 53%, Washington 27% (from 411,600 to524,000]), Pittsburgh 15%, Miami 13%. Pittsburgh systemmanagers say they lack the capacity to handle the 90,500riders the Department of Transportation claims were projectedfor their light rail system.   The suggestion that &quot;development sprawl and theflexibility of the personal car allow individuals andemployers to find their way around (traffic) jams&quot; is hardlya basis on which to build public policy. It ignores the needsof people without cars, the environmental costs of autodependence and the oil-import crisis toward which we are&quot;driving.&quot;   Ross Capon   Executive Director   National Association of Railroad Passengers   Washington   ---   Mr. Ferguson offered fear of and loathing for California'srecent vote for higher gasoline taxes for rail transit. Hecites &quot;horrendous cost overruns&quot; of new systems as evidencethat the case for rail transit is overstated.   His thesis is off the track. The &quot;evidence&quot; of projectedvs. actual ridership and costs in the accompanying table isdeceptive, and he misses entirely the salient point of railtransit's importance to our economy and an urban area'squality of life.   The numbers, circulated by the Department ofTransportation in its tiresome campaign to discredit railtransit, are mostly outdated projections made during the veryearly planning stages of these projects. Also, only a selectfew projects were cited in the table, ones that convenientlyfit the anti-rail argument. Where are the numbers for SanFrancisco's popular BART, the successful Boston and Chicagoextensions or the respected San Diego Trolley that recovers90% of its operating costs from paying passengers?   If rail transit has been the bust Mr. Ferguson seems tothink it is, then why are so many communities eager to paymore taxes to strengthen their rail systems with extensions?I think it is because they recognize rail transit's multiple,attractive qualities and overall investment worthiness.Cities decide to build rail systems for many reasons, notjust cost and ridership. Some, like Buffalo and Miami, userail to spur private development; others want its clean-airbenefits; some seek to speed travel time for commuterswithout adding to roadway congestion. All understand that theoperating costs of rail transit -- per passenger mile -- aresignificantly lower than those of buses.   David Alan Aschauer, while with the Federal Reserve Bankof Chicago, first drew attention to the strong link betweenAmerica's sinking level of public works and transportationinvestment and our laggard productivity, especially incontrast to our transit-wise trading partners.   Certainly it is in the federal interest to see that thetraveling public and the private sector get the moderntransportation infrastructure essential to prosperity at homeand the improvement of our position internationally.   Instead of bashing rail transit with phony numbers, Mr.Ferguson and the Journal should acknowledge that theCalifornia ballot victories are solid evidence of a growingpublic recognition of mass transit's key role in our futuremobility and our economic and environmental progress.
