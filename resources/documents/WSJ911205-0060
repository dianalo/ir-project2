The 189-page report, prepared for the commission byWashington, D.C., law firm Arnold andamp; Porter, was immediatelyattacked by the U.S. manufacturers. A McDonnell Douglas Corp.spokesman called the findings &quot;totally absurd andpreposterous.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Both McDonnell Douglas and Boeing Co. said the studyfailed to understand the role of government in the U.S.aerospace industry, where the government acts as a customerand not an underwriter of programs. Furthermore, the U.S.companies said, European aerospace companies also receivegovernment contracts.   The EC report said that if 1991 dollar amounts were used,the U.S. aircraft industry may have received as much as $41.5billion in government support from 1976 to 1990. The reportsaid the money came in the form of benefits derived from U.S.Department of Defense research programs, National Aeronauticsand Space Administration research programs, and tax deferralsand exemptions.   &quot;Never in our wildest imagination would we have expectedto find such levels&quot; of U.S. government support, said PeterCarl, an EC trade negotiator.   The McDonnell Douglas spokesman countered: &quot;The Airbuspartners are defense contractors in their own right. They arethe national champions in their home countries and don't facethe kind of competition Boeing and McDonnell Douglas face.&quot;   Boeing estimated that Airbus's partners received revenueof about $85 billion from defense contracts in the 1980s,separate from the direct government aid currently at issuebetween the U.S. and the EC.   Airbus is a consortium of British Aerospace PLC,Daimler-Benz AG's Deutsche Airbus unit, Aerospatiale S.A. ofFrance and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.   U.S. trade officials declined to comment on the specificsof the report until they've had a chance to examine it. Theynoted, however, that the allegations of indirect support forthe civil aircraft industry were not new. A 1988 reportcommissioned by Airbus claimed U.S. aircraft manufacturershad received as much as $23 billion from indirect governmentsupport.   The Aerospace Industries Association, which representsboth Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, said the EC study'sfindings are &quot;totally lacking in factual evidence andcredibility.&quot; Don Fuqua, the association's president, saidthe U.S. subsidies alleged by the EC don't exist.</TEXT></DOC>
