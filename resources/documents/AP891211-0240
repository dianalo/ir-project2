(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   I count three tools as indispensable inmy garden: the spading fork, the trowel and the pen.   True, my pen has got an advanced degree now and dresses up as acomputer, wooing me with fancy tricks. But basically, it does thesame work.   Sure, you can garden without records, but many of us come torely on and enjoy the day-by-day jottings that chart our successesand failures over years.   On a spring day in Virginia in 1766, 22-year-old ThomasJefferson scribbled, ``March 30. Purple hyacinth begins to bloom.''Thus began a notebook he found time for even during his presidency.A farmer as well as a gardener, Jefferson was a painstakingnotekeeper. For eight years, he tabulated the earliest and latestappearance of 37 vegetables on the Washington market.   Most importantly, a notebook profiles the individual garden,establishing the right times and places to plant things andreminding you when to dust or fertilize. Your plot differs fromyour neighbor's in soil, moisture, slant of sun, hours of shade.You may get a killing frost while a garden 50 yards down the roadescapes. You can't steer only by directions on seed packets or inmanuals; they're too generalized.   By keeping careful notes, I learned the best time to plantBrussels sprouts. Conventionally, in my area 50 miles north ofManhattan, you're advised to plant in late July. But my plantsdidn't make enough growth then. The middle of June turned out best,giving me nice sprouts in time to benefit from the hard Octoberfrosts that vastly improve their taste.   Then, some plant varieties do well in your garden and othersdon't. You may be better off staying with your tried-and-trueplants rather than going for the newest hybrids. With dozens ofvarieties to track, your notebook keeps a much better record oftrials and errors than you could hope to in your memory.   Notes, or sketches, also will remind you where you put whatwhen. Some plants, like the cabbage family, need to be moved aroundfrom year to year to prevent disease.   Many things go into a gardening diary. Little mystery storiesmay unfold. Looking at my 1983 notes, I see my asparagus tipssuddenly developed a chewed look. Slug bait did nothing at all. Norwas it a strange disease. The culprit _ I caught him at it _ turnedout to be a woodchuck that got over the fence.   On Oct. 4, 1987, we had the earliest snowfall in my memory,interesting for my diary because my beans and other tender cropssurvived.   My word processor has tidied up my record-keeping immensely. The``insert'' and ``delete'' enable me to correct, rewrite and edit asI go along. At the end of the year, I give the diary a touch-up,print it and bind it in a notebook.   If you're a computer buff, you can move up to databaserecord-keeping, letting you look at your garden from numerousperspectives. Creating a database is painstaking work and it takesa while to accumulate a significant amount of data. But eventuallyyou can ask your computer, for example, what flowers you have grownthat bloom in the shade, what kind of soil they like and when toplant them. Or how many European lettuces you've grown over theyears. Push a couple keys and the computer will respond with names,dates, country of origin and anything else you wanted to recordabout the lettuce. And it will do it in various formats, givingyou, say, only French lettuces, or slow-bolting ones.   Big deal, you might say, but you get your answers instantly andit's fun to do. And it's up to you to create the variety andpenetration of searches.   If you have a computer but lack the time or patience to buildyour own database, you can get ready-made gardening programs thatcombine note-keeping with instruction and graphics. You can fileaway sketches of your garden as it looked from year to year, thushelping you to rotate your crops. Your zip code tells the programwhat plants are feasible for your area.   For the non-computer minded, there are special notebooks for thegarden.   Whether you work with pen or computer, keeping notes, likedigging in the dirt, is hard but brings special rewards.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Dec. 14</NOTE></DOC>
