Robert Wallach had stayed withhis original plan, Attorney General Edwin Meese III's files wouldnever have contained a 1985 memo outlining a plan to pay theIsraeli Labor Party to ensure the safety of a proposed $1 billionIraqi oil pipeline.   The memo to Meese is part of a three-document package thatWallach gave to the attorney general on the same day in September1985 in an attempt to revive the project, which was foundering overIraq's demand for an insurance package against Israeli bombing.   The documents, now part of special prosecutor James McKay'scriminal investigation into Meese's activities, were released lastweek by the attorney general's lawyers. In addition, three telexmessages from Wallach to a Swiss oilman who was a partner in thepipeline project surfaced last week and showed that Wallach andother project backers attempted to have Pentagon budget money paidto the Israelis not to bomb the pipeline.   The pipeline memos also have drawn the attention of Iran-Contraindependent counsel Lawrence Walsh because they draw the first linkbetween the pipeline project and the trade of arms for hostages.   The burgeoning paper trail in the Meese-pipeline episodeincludes a Sept. 19, 1985 handwritten letter from then-IsraeliPrime Minister Shimon Peres expressing support for the proposedpipeline.   But McKay, who is investigating Meese's role in the pipelineproject, is focusing on two memos, both dated Sept. 25, 1985, fromWallach to Meese. The Peres letter was attached to the first memo,a four-page explanation of the problems surrounding the project. Init, Wallach urged Meese to help round up support from top U.S.officials.   One problem, Wallach wrote, was that seeking the insurancepackage required disclosing to a number of bankers and others thenature of the ``security package'' guaranteeing that Israelwouldn't destroy the line.   Wallach said this package involved the ``never-to-be-stated butfully understood quid pro quo.''   Meese's lawyers say the quid pro quo was a reference to plans byWallach's client, Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport, to make availableto Israel substantial amounts of oil from the pipeline. Discountson the oil were to amount to $650 million to $700 million over 10years.   However, government sources familiar with the investigation ofMeese say McKay is trying to determine whether the ``quid pro quo''memo is related to the second memo that Wallach handed over toMeese at the same time.   The second memo, marked ``personal andamp; confidential _ for youreyes, only,'' contains a paragraph which says that Rappaportconfirmed with Peres the ``arrangement'' in which Israel was toreceive up to $700 million over 10 years from the pipeline. Thenext sentence says: ``What was also indicated to me, and whichwould be denied everywhere, is that a portion of those funds willgo directly to Labor.''   McKay wants to know whether the money for the Israeli LaborParty headed by Peres is the ``quid pro quo'' mentioned in thefirst memo.   If it is, the two memos suggest that Meese may have known abouta plan to bribe Israeli politicians as a way to assure the safetyof the planned pipeline. If Meese knew about such a proposedpayoff, he might be charged with violating or conspiring to violatethe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. That law bars bribes to foreignofficials and gives the attorney general authority to file civilsuits to stop U.S. companies from bribing potential foreigncustomers.   In the ``quid pro quo'' memo, Wallach was trying to explain toMeese the importance of Rappaport to the pipeline project. Todemonstrate the ``credibility and relationship'' of Rappaport toIsrael, Wallach, a longtime friend of the attorney general, alsosaid that he was ``preparing ... a memorandum for my own files'' onother matters Wallach said he had discussed with the Swiss oilman.   ``I will communicate orally the contents of that memorandum,''Wallach said.   But he changed his mind _ for reasons as yet undisclosed.   Instead of giving Meese a verbal summary of that memo, Wallachgave the document to Meese, thus allowing the special prosecutorand the public to see what Wallach said were Rappaport's thoughtsabout money for the Israeli Labor Party.   Was this a planned bribe?   Peres, who is now Israel's foreign minister, denies receivingany bribe offer; a Peres aide is quoted as saying the then-primeminister was told Israel would get oil discounts but Peres didn'ttake that seriously. Rappaport denies making any payoffs. And Meesesays he doesn't recall reading the portion of the second memomentioning Labor Party payments.</TEXT></DOC>
