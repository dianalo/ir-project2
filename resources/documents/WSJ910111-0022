McDonnell Douglas shares have skidded 28% since DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney canceled the Navy's A-12 attack planeMonday. The jet once held the promise of generating more than$50 billion in business for McDonnell Douglas and partnerGeneral Dynamics.</LP><TEXT>   But a case can be made, some on Wall Street say, for thebuyer with the long view, someone who plans to hold on toMcDonnell shares for, say, two or three years. &quot;This could bea hell of a buying opportunity,&quot; says Cyrus J. Lawrence'sHoward Rubel, who admittedly is &quot;substantially under water&quot;these days, having issued a late October report recommendingthe company as a buy.   Even people who have been far more bearish concede thereis at least a cogent argument to be made for the stock nowthat it is down 11 points since Monday to 27 3/4. &quot;Thechances are that the company is going to pull itself out ofthis,&quot; says Jack Modzelewski of PaineWebber. &quot;When arefortunes made? You buy when there is blood on the Street.&quot;   The prospect of a turnaround at McDonnell Douglas liesmostly in the success of its MD-11 commercial aircraft lineand its continuing effort to cut expenses, largely throughlayoffs. The company says some 15,000 positions have beeneliminated since May and it is on track to pare as much as $1billion annually from its cost structureeven better than the$700 million it was aiming for. Many on the Street expect abig improvement in cash flow in the next couple of years.   The biggest hurdle is still military projects. There ispotential for heavy write-offs on the A-12, C-17 cargo planeand T-45 trainer jet, all plagued by technical problems andcost overruns. The C-17 in particular could prove a cashsieve, with one Air Force audit suggesting the company couldeventually find itself as much as $580 million over thecontract's $6.6 billion cost ceiling.   But one theory holds that McDonnell Douglas won't recordany charges in the near term, but rather will stick to morepropitious accounting methods. Already, the company ispursuing $125 million in claims on the C-17, $293 million onthe T-45 and its share of $1.6 billion on the A-12, leavingthings tied up in legal proceedings with the Pentagon and itsquarterly earnings reports relatively clean. By 1992, Mr.Rubel says, profit could reach $9 a share. &quot;I don't see anymotivation at all for the company to settle&quot; these disputesanytime soon, says Prudential-Bache's Paul Nisbet. By thetime it is ready to do so, he believes, the MD-11 could begenerating nearly $1 billion of cash annually. Meanwhile, thecompany's MD-80 aircraft line already seems to have turnedthe corner.   Significantly, worker morale is improving at the LongBeach, Calif., site McDonnell hopes will be its long-termprofit center. &quot;There are still problems,&quot; says Richard Rios,president of the United Auto Workers local with which thecompany will soon hold contract talks. &quot;But the end of theyear was a big improvement.&quot;   Many, of course, remain unconvinced that McDonnell Douglasis headed anywhere but into the ground. &quot;There is a case thatcan be made, but I'm not a believer,&quot; says Morgan Stanley'sPhil Friedman. He notes that many of the company's principaldefense programs, including the F-15 fighter, Apachehelicopter and AV-8B jet, could be axed from the federalbudget in coming years. It doesn't help that a second plannedU.S. arms deal with Saudi Arabia now seems tabled bycongressional resistance.   Some further contend that the commercial operations are introuble. Orders are softening for narrow-body planes like theMD-80 and its follow-on, the MD-90. And the MD-11, withdisappointing fuel efficiency, faces stiff competition fromAirbus Industrie and Boeing, which just introduced a directchallenger, the 777. Despite nagging rumors, though, thecompany says no firm orders have been canceled.   Although the company has a new, $750 million revolvingcredit pact, short-sellers of McDonnell Douglas -- and thereare plenty of these investors, who bet that a stock will godown -- believe banks will simply stop lending the companymoney. &quot;They just don't have the access to capital,&quot; saysBruce Berger, a Connecticut financial analyst who haspersonally shorted the stock.   PaineWebber's Mr. Modzelewski figures there is about a 70%chance the company will ultimately manage a safe landing. Buthe still rates the stock unattractive. &quot;It can still godownward, so that's the call,&quot; he says. Investors' dilemmacomes down to this: If McDonnell Douglas recovers, evenslowly, some think it could be a $100 stock. If thingsunravel, &quot;it could be a zero,&quot; says Fred Wadler, an analystfor a hedge fund at Gilford Securities in Chicago.   ---   McDonnell Douglas   (NYSE; Symbol: MD)                                                                                                          Business: Aerospace                                                                                                          Nine months ended Sept. 30, 1990:   Revenue: $12.12 billion   Net income: $307 million, $8 a share                                                                                                          Third quarter, Sept. 30, 1990:   Per-share earnings: $6.46 vs. 98 cents*                                                                                                          Average daily trading volume: 267,955 shares                                                                                                          Common shares outstanding: 38.3 million                                                                                                          *Year-ago figure restated to reflect discontinuedoperations.</TEXT></DOC>
