The increase came despite lower prices for beef, as the droughtprompted farmers to slaughter more animals because of burned-outpastures and higher feed prices.   Just three days after the Federal Reserve Board initiated anincrease in interest rates to fight inflation, the Labor Departmentsaid wholesale prices rose 0.5 percent in July, the same monthlyincreases as in May and March.   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We wouldrather not see any increase in producer prices, but we stillbelieve inflation remains low and under control.''   In June, the department's Producer Price Index for finishedgoods rose 0.4 percent, or at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, morethan double the 2.2 percent rate of wholesale price inflation forall of 1987.   Wholesale prices for consumer foods increased at a slower pacein July _ 0.4 percent _ than for goods overall, indicating to someanalysts that the worst immediate effects of the drought plaguingthe farm belt were over. Food prices had been rising faster thanprices for other products on the wholesale level since April.   Overall energy prices, meanwhile, remained unchanged after a 1.6percent drop in June, with a 3 percent seasonally adjusted increasein gasoline prices offsetting a 6.1 percent decline in whatdistributors pay for home heating oil.   Excluding food and energy, wholesale prices rose at 0.6 percentin July. Because food and energy prices are highly volatile frommonth to month, most analysts look to price changes for otherproducts as a better indication of underlying inflation.   Analysts said the softer food prices partly offset what theycalled an over-reaction in June to the drought.   ``As expected, higher feed prices and burned-out pastures havesharply increased market slaughters and begun to influence meatprices,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecastingat Georgia State University. In addition, Ratajczak said, fruittrees under stress from the unusually hot weather are throwing offtheir fruit early ``resulting in a temporary early supply offruit.''   Wholesale prices in July fell 2.5 percent for beef, 10.5 percentfor pork and 0.2 percent for soft drinks. They rose 2.3 percent forfruit, compared with a 6.7 percent increase in June, 7.5 percentfor vegetables, 13.3 percent for bakery products, 2 percent forchickens and 20.3 percent for processed turkeys.   Rataczak predicted that meat prices will rise sharply in 1989 asa result of the early slaughters and fruit prices will spiralupwards this fall because of less than the usual supply then.   Price increases were widespread across a wide variety ofnon-food items. Men's clothing rose 0.9 percent, drugs were up 1.1percent, cosmetics increased 1.7 percent and auto prices edged up0.5 percent after a 1 percent decrease in June.   The only non-food, non-energy consumer items for which wholesaleprices fell last month were glassware, down 2.3 percent, andhousehold flatware, down 0.4 percent.   The July increase in finished goods overall put the LaborDepartment's index at 108.5. That means a variety of goods costing$100 at the wholesale level in 1982 cost $108.50 last month,compared with $107.90 in June and $106.00 a year ago.   Wholesale prices for intermediate goods used in production rose0.7 percent in July, indicating more inflation lies ahead despitethe Federal Reserve Board's decision Tuesday to boost the rate itcharges banks for credit from 6 percent to 6.5 percent.   Prices for intermediate goods, or those used in processing, hadrisen 0.9 percent in June. Analysts said the smaller July increasewas due almost entirely to a decline in oil prices before beforeOPEC members Iran and Iraq agreed late in the monthy to acease-fire.   Excluding food and energy, prices for intermediate goods such asindustrial chemicals, finished steel products, paper and syntheticfibers rose 0.7 percent overall.   However, raw material prices fell 1.1 percent, with crude oilprices plummeting 9.3 percent. Corn prices soared 20 percent on thedrought, but the increase was smaller than in June. Raw iron andsteel prices jumpted 12 percent after holding fairly steady forthree months.   Price changes on the retail level usually lag one to threemonths behind those at wholesale. Consumer price inflation has beenaveraging 4.4 percent for the past 18 months. July figures onconsumer prices are to be published Aug. 23.</TEXT></DOC>
