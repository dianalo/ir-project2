(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA said Wednesday night it isdelaying the launch of Discovery from late February to mid-March toreplace three suspect turbopumps whose failure could be fatal to ashuttle and its crew.   The announcement came following a high-level meeting of shuttlemanagers who have debated for several days whether to pull thehigh-speed turbopumps, which transform liquid oxygen into gas in thespaceship's main engines.   Officials said Discovery will be transported to the launch padearly Friday and switching of the pumps will be done there inparallel with other operations. The first pump could be pulled as asearly as Sunday.   Because of the uncertainty of the availability of new pumps andthe length of time to make the replacements, NASA said it would notset a firm launch date until a flight readiness review in lateFebruary.   It said the earliest the launch could take place would be inmid-March. The agency had been aiming for a Feb. 23 liftoff, but aseries of technical delays not related to the pumps already haddelayed that date several days.   If the date slips past mid-March, the planned April 28 launch ofAtlantis with the Magellan-Venus probe would also have to bedelayed, officials said.   The three turbopumps became questionable when engineersdiscovered two tiny cracks in a bearing unit in one of Atlantis'pumps after it completed the second post-Challenger mission inDecember.   The engineers believe the cracks were caused by stress corrosionresulting from moisture trapped inside the bearing housing duringthe manufacturing process. But they are not certain how the moisturepenetrated the metal.   Officials became concerned when it was learned that two ofDiscovery's pump bearings had gone through the same manufacturingprocess as the cracked one.   They decided at Wednesday's meeting to remove all three pumps andreplace them with new, carefully-inspected units.   The turbopumps operate in flight at extremely high speeds,pressures and temperatures, and a failure of one of them could setoff a fatal engine explosion. The cracks on Atlantis were too smallto cause trouble, but if such cracks widened and split the bearingunit, it could be dangerous, NASA said.   The agency has said the Atlantis mission in April has priorityover the launch of Discovery with its communications satellite andthat it would scrub the Discovery flight until later in the year ifit can't get off the pad by about March 15.   That's because the Atlantis astronauts have only a 25-day launchwindow that is favorable for dispatching Magellan to Venus. Earthand Venus will not be in proper alignment again until 1991.   NASA said it could delay the Atlantis flight a few days, butthat's something it would not like to do. It would like to preservethe entire launch window in case of problems.   Only one shuttle launch pad is currently available. A second isbeing refurbished.</TEXT></DOC>
