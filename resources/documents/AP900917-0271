Keating, former head of Lincoln and its parent company, AmericanContinental Corp. of Phoenix, was to be arraigned Tuesday morningin Superior Court on charges of criminal fraud, KCBS-TV reported,citing unidentified sources.   The businessman was indicted in connection with Lincoln's saleof more than $200 million in now virtually worthless junk bonds to22,000 investors, many of whom were elderly, according to thereport.   The indictment would represent the first criminal charges in theLincoln case. Numerous civil lawsuits have been filed.   District Attorney Ira Reiner declined to confirm the report, butissued a statement saying his office had completed its presentationto a special grand jury investigating the matter.   ``Since grand jury proceedings are confidential, the districtattorney's office will not comment until such time the court liftsthe seal of confidentiality,'' the statement from Reiner's officesaid.   The grand jury began investigating in February whether Lincolnofficials misled bond buyers into believing the high-risk bondswere federally insured. The district attorney had been presentingevidence since April.   The government seized control of Lincoln in April 1989.Regulators estimate the bailout could cost taxpayers as much as $2billion. Federal and state prosecutors also were not in theiroffices.   Last month, a federal judge in Washington upheld the governmenttakeover of Lincoln, saying the operation of the thrift by Keatingand others ``amounted to looting.''   On Monday night, Shirley Lampel, one of the disaffectedbondholders, responded to the report of the indictment, saying: ``Idon't know how many bondholders are out there . . . but they'redancing in the street tonight.   ``We'd like to get our money back,'' she added.   U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin dismissed Keating's suit torecover the collapsed thrift and said it was ``abundantly clear''Keating and other officials abused their positions.   Keating could not immediately be reached for comment. The LosAngeles-and Chicago-based attorneys representing Keating were notin their offices after business hours.   Under a recent agreement announced by the Justice Department,Keating must tell the Office of Thrift Supervision 48 hours inadvance of any transactions exceeding $5,000. Keating already hasprovided financial statements, which have not been disclosed.   Those terms had previously been imposed on Keating by apreliminary injunction issued by the U.S. District Court in LosAngeles. The announcement indicated he had agreed to them.</TEXT></DOC>
