The firstset of amendments terminates restrictions on the importation and exportationof publications and other tangible informational materials to bring theRegulations into conformity with section 2502(a) of the Omnibus Trade andCompetitiveness Act, Pub. L. No. 100-418, 102 Stat. 1107 (the ``Trade Act'').The second set of amendments sets forth the Treasury Department's long-standinginterpretation that the existing general licenses unblocking certain trustand estate assets held by U.S. nationals apply only to trusts created bygift, donation, or bequest, and not to trusts such as ``sinking funds''established by issuers of securities. The third set of amendments providesfor the issuance of specific licenses unblocking estate assets of deceaseddesignated nationals under certain circumstances to heirs who are not designatednationals. A set of conforming amendments incidental to the trusts andestates licensing amendments provides, in andSection;andSection; 500.505 and515.505, that persons who have never been designated nationals of an embargoedcountry and who are resident in, or organized under the laws of, the UnitedStates or the authorized trade territory are licensed as ``unblocked nationals.''A further set of conforming provisions amends the definition of ``authorizedtrade territory'' in andSection;andSection; 500.322 and 515.322 to expresslyinclude Australia and New Zealand, in accordance with long-standing Treasurypolicy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>February 2, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>William B.

App. 5(b) (``TWEA''),to remove the authority of the President to regulate or prohibit, directlyor indirectly, the importation from any country, or the exportation toany country, whether commercial or otherwise, of informational materialswhich are not otherwise controlled for exports for national security reasonsunder section 5 of the Export Administration Act of 1979, 50 U.S.C. 2401-2419,or with respect to which no acts are prohibited by Chapter 37 of Title18 of the United States Code, dealing with espionage and censorship.Financial and other transactions directly related to the physical importationand exportation of tangible informational materials are authorized. Transactionsrelating to the dissemination of informational materials are also authorized,such as copying, dubbing, and translating. Transactions relating to thesubstantive enhancement or alteration of informational materials, however,remain prohibited.Under section 2502(a)(2) of the Trade Act, the new limitation on the President'sauthority under TWEA applies to existing and future sanctions programs.This rule makes revisions to the Regulations necessary to conform themto this new limitation on Presidential authority under TWEA.The rule also revises sections 500.524 and 515.524 of the Regulations,which are identical provisions authorizing, among other things, paymentof distributive shares of principal and interest due under certain blockedtrusts and estates of infants and incompetents to unblocked beneficiaries.This revision is for purposes of clarification only, deemed necessary inthe wake of a court decision, <T3>Cuellar v. Secretary of the Treasury, et al.</T3>, Civ. Action No.87-1611 (S.D. Fla., March 16, 1988), misconstruing andSection; 515.524 toapply to a sinking fund established by the Republic of Cuba. The revisionsets forth the Treasury Department's long-standing interpretation thatandSection;andSection; 500.524 and 515.524 apply only to trusts created bygift, donation, or bequest, and not to business or commercial trusts, suchas sinking funds established by an issuer of securities. The latter securityarrangements are established in order to ensure the availability of fundsto pay off installments of interest or principal as the securities mature.Treasury distinguishes such sinking funds, intended to obtain financingfor business and public or private commercial activities, from trusts establishedin order to make a gift of funds or other assets to a specific person orclass of persons. Thus, under the Treasury Department's long-standing interpretationof these provisions, sinking funds and other similar arrangements are noteligible for individual unblockings under these general licenses.Third, this rule modifies current licensing policy regarding blocked estateassets of deceased designated nationals. Formerly, a deceased designatednational (<T3>i.e.</T3> a national of an embargoed country at the time of his death)was treated as retaining an interest in his estate. The estate assets remainedblocked, therefore, even if the heirs were not designated or speciallydesignated nationals and no other nexus to the designated foreign countryexisted.Under the new licensing policy announced in this rule, specific licenseswill be issued to allow the unblocking of estate assets of deceased designatednationals under circumstances where the following conditions are met: (1)The assets have passed by intestate succession or by testamentary disposition;(2) the heir is a permanent resident of the United States or the authorizedtrade territory and is not a specially designated national; and (3) theheir can establish by documentary evidence the death of the decedent andhis own heirship and residence in the United States or the authorized tradeterritory. License applications to unblock particular estate assets inheritedby designated nationals, or in which an unblocked heir and a designatednational share in undivided interest, will be denied. Provisions alreadyin effect authorizing certain transactions with regard to blocked estateswill continue in effect as to those assets remaining blocked under thisrule.Since the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, the provisionsof the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice ofproposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay ineffective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemakingis required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601<T3>et seq.</T3>, does not apply. Because the Regulations are issued withrespect to a foreign affairs function of the United States, they are notsubject to Executive Order 12291 of February 17, 1981, dealing with Federalregulations.This rule is being issued without prior notice and public procedure pursuantto the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553). For this reason, thecollections of information contained in this rule have been reviewed and,pending receipt and evaluation of public comments, approved by the Officeof Management and Budget (``OMB'') under control number 1505-0075.The collections of information in this regulation are in andSection;andSection;500.557, 500.568, 515.552, and 515.568 of Title 31 of the Code of FederalRegulations. Submission of the information required under these sectionsis necessary in order for the Office of Foreign Assets Control to evaluatethe merits of a license application seeking to unblock frozen estate assetsof decreased designated nationals, a transaction that would otherwise beprohibited under the Regulations. The likely respondents are individuals.The estimated total annual reporting burden is 500 hours. The estimatedaverage annual burden hours per respondent is five hours. The estimatednumber of respondents is 100. Comments concerning the collection of informationand the accuracy of this burden estimate, and suggestions for reducingthis burden should be directed to the Office of Information and RegulatoryAffairs, attention: Desk Officer for the Office of Foreign Assets Control,U.S. Department of the Treasury, or the Paperwork Reduction Project (1505-0075),of the Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, with copiesto the Office of Information Resources Management, Department of the Treasury,15th andamp; Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20220.
