Christiansfear the future.''   An estimated 12 million to 14 million Christians live in theregion, gathered in minority pockets among 120 million Moslems and4 million Jews.   ``As Christians, the biggest challenge we face is the risingmilitant fundamentalism of Islam and the militant fundamentalism ofJudaism of Israel,'' said Dr. George Sabra, assistant professor oftheology at the Near East School of Theology in west Beirut.   Moslem persecution of the followers of Jesus dates from theCrusades, when they were viewed as fifth columnists for theinvading Europeans who came to recover the Holy Land.   That suspicion lingers.   ``Fundamentalists ought to understand that pluralism in the Arabworld is a necessity of life,'' said Bishop Eliya Khoury, head ofthe Anglican Church in Jordan. ``If not, believe me, extremismbreeds only opposite extremism.''   In Lebanon, Maronite Catholics see their fight in a 14-year-oldcivil war as another chapter in a centuries-old struggle forsurvival against Islam.   The Maronites, the only Christians to have held political powerin the modern Arab world, claim that Lebanon's Shiite Moslems wantto create an Islamic state modeled on Iran.   Their fight to hold onto their traditional privileges is thetaproot of Lebanon's civil war.   ``They're the only Christian community with a distinct politicalhistory,'' said Professor Kamal Salibi, who teaches history at theAmerican University of Beirut.   ``They fear being overwhelmed. ... If the system is democratizedthey would be outvoted and they can't carry the day.''   Maronite extremism is the starkest Christian reaction to thegrowth of both Islamic and Jewish fundamentalism in the Middle East.   Christians increasingly believe that if they do not assert theirown beliefs they might be subsumed by fundamentalist zeal.   ``In addition to sharing with everyone else the wars, theeconomic problems, the Great Power challenges, ... Christians arecaught between Israel on the one hand and Islam on the other,'' theCouncil of Churches' Habib said.   But their leaders fear that an aggressive response could triggertheir own destruction. The tension pushes thousands to emigrate.   The Maronites, once slightly more than 50 percent of Lebanon'spopulation, have dwindled to about 30 percent.   Christians who remain in the region worry about the loss oftheir special identity.   Mary Saliba, a Christian mother living in predominately Moslemwest Beirut, says she sends her four children as often as she canto the Christian sector.   ``I don't want them to end up marrying Moslems,'' she said.   Moslems see the Maronites as warring to keep their lockhold onthe Lebanon's presidency and other centers of power reserved forthem since independence from France in 1943.   Under Israel's laws, all citizens are guaranteed equal civilrights. But its creation as a state for Jews effectivelymarginalized Christians, Christian leaders say.   The political factor is heightened because most Christians inthe Holy Land are Palestinians, who fundamentalist Jewish groupsseek to expel from the Jordan River's West Bank, taken by Israelsince the 1967 war.   In the Islamic belief, Christians and Jews are consideredharbingers of the true faith and are protected as fellow believersin the Old Testament.   But there is a deep fear ``of fundamentalists overthrowingexisting regimes and establishing societies based on Sharia(Islamic law),'' said Habib.   These laws include banning pork, veiling women, cutting off thehands of convicted thieves and stoning adulteresses.   Only about 180,000 Christians, mostly Armenians, remain in Iran.Tens of thousands left after the 1979 Islamic revolution institutedSharia.   ``You can't study Armenian or the Bible there,'' said Joseph, a15-year-old whose family moved to Cyprus so he could enroll in theArmenian school.   ``There are lots of extra lessons _ Arabic, the Koran, Persian _which I won't need in the future,'' he said.   Sudan is locked in a civil war because Christians in its southloath the Islamic rules voted in by the northern Moslems.   Moslem clerics call such fears baseless.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
