A spokesman for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. said thatit, as well as Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. and Fuji HeavyIndustries Ltd., were approached in December by visitingBritish Aerospace executives. But he stressed that whileMitsubishi &quot;is certainly interested,&quot; the proposal was still&quot;vague&quot; and that no negotiations were scheduled.</LP><TEXT>   The meetings, reported yesterday in London by theFinancial Times, represent another attempt by the Europeanaerospace industry to loosen the Japanese industry's nearlyexclusive relationship with Boeing Co. of the U.S. The AirbusIndustrie consortium, of which British Aerospace is a member,recently proposed that the three Japanese companies join theEuropeans in making a super jumbo jet.   Boeing doesn't make a small, 100-seat plane, so any suchtie-up wouldn't directly affect the U.S. company'srelationship with Japanese industry. Still, the Mitsubishispokesman said the companies would consult with Boeing beforetaking action.</TEXT></DOC>
