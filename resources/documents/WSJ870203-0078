Terms weren't disclosed.    Owens-Corning said the facility will become part of Jim Walter's Building Materials Group unit, which had revenue of $740 million in the company's fiscal year ended Aug. 31. Jim Walter is a Tampa, Fla.-based maker of building materials.    The sale of the Meridian plant will conclude Owens-Corning's sale of the manufacturing assets of its interior-products division. The elimination of the unit is part of Owens-Corning's restructuring and recapitalization plan that last year helped stave off an unsuccessful $2.1 billion, $74-a-share, hostile tender offer by Wickes Cos., Santa Monica, Calif.    Owens-Corning Fiberglas makes glass-fiber insulation and construction products. </TEXT></DOC>
