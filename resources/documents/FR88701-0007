As the Supreme Court has now held tothe contrary, the Parole Commission will no longer direct persons requestingcopies of their presentence investigation reports to the sentencing court.The Commission is deleting that portion of its disclosure regulation requiringthis procedure. Because this deletion will remove a present restriction,this rule will become effective upon publication. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 28 CFR Part 2</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Probation and parole, Prisoners.28 CFR Part 2 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 2_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
