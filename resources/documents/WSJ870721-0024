The decline in profit was in line with analysts' expectations. Bert C. Roberts Jr., MCI's president and chief operating officer, said he is &quot;extremely pleased with the results for a quarter which we expected would be the most difficult of the year.&quot;    For the latest quarter, Washington-based MCI posted net of $8 million, or three cents a share, compared with $16 million, or six cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $952 million from $943 million.    Earnings in the latest period, however, include an after-tax gain of $1 million for tax-loss carry-forwards and a pre-tax gain of $6 million on the company's previously reported settlement of antitrust litigation.    Excluding both gains, the company earned about $1 million, or less than one cent a share, according to William E. Conway Jr., MCI's chief financial officer.    Separately, in national over-the-counter trading, MCI closed yesterday at $7.75, down 25 cents.    As expected, MCI felt the full impact of the 9% price cut it initiated on March 1. Revenue for the second quarter was slightly lower than the $955 million the company posted for the first quarter. But Mr. Conway said the second-quarter figure still exceeded his expectations. Excluding the effect of price cuts in both periods, MCI said revenue rose about 6% from the first quarter.    However, Jack Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said the underlying rate of growth in minutes of use of the company's long-distance services is probably lower than 6%. &quot;One reason their revenue looks okay is because their uncollectables -- resulting primarily from callers making fraudulent use of other customers' access codes -- are down, compared with the first quarter,&quot; he said. The company didn't specify the amount of uncollectables.    &quot;The biggest worry for MCI continues to be revenue growth and traffic growth,&quot; Mr. Grubman added. &quot;They're doing what they can to control the expense side, but Sprint isn't going away and ATandamp;T is becoming more ferocious in guarding its bread-and-butter business.&quot;    US Sprint Communications Co., a joint venture between GTE Corp. and United Telecommunications Inc., is the nation's third-largest long-distance concern. MCI is the second largest, after American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.    MCI said future revenue growth will be buoyed by sales of the toll-free 800 service it introduced in March and its growing international business.    Mr. Conway also predicted that the company won't be hurt by the 5% price cut it plans to make Aug. 1 to reflect a reduction in the access charges it pays for connections with the networks of local telephone companies. &quot;For the first time, it will be roughly a wash,&quot; Mr. Conway said of the upcoming price cut. &quot;That is very good news.&quot;    Mr. Conway also said he expects MCI to exercise its option to borrow $300 million by year-end from its largest shareholder, International Business Machines Corp.    Borrowing the money could enable MCI to repay higher interest rate debt and reduce its costs, Mr. Conway said. But, under terms of its agreement with IBM, MCI would have to issue in exchange for the cash securities that would be convertible into MCI common stock. &quot;I would obviously like to have the (MCI) stock price higher when we sell them the convertible . . . so it would be convertible into fewer shares of MCI,&quot; Mr. Conway said. </TEXT></DOC>
