 The problems of handling color oncomputers were solved by Scitex, Crosfield, Hell and Dainippon Screen in thelate 1970s and '80s.andP;  Now the focus has shifted to handling color withoff-the-shelf computers, software and output devices.andP;  But the process can bedifficult, expensive and slow, and there are quality issues still to beresolved.andM;Phases of color-separation use.andP;  Mike Templeman of Aldus summed up the fourstages through which he went--and through which all new users of colorseparation are apt to go:andM;* Unbounded (and unwarranted) enthusiasmandM;* Deep confusionandM;* Deeper depressionandM;* Guarded optimismandM;Having reached the fourth stage, Templeman was in a position to describe boththe potential and the pitfalls of color separation on desktop platforms.andP;  Hispresentation alerted would-be desktop separators in the audience to some keyareas of potential difficulty.andM;* Scanner performance.andP;  High-quality desktop scanners such as the Nikon,Array and new Howtek models can take 10 minutes to make a scan.andP;  There can bea bottleneck at the scanner, especially if rescans are necessary.andM;* Network performance.andP;  Templeman moved files on Aldus internal localnetworks to test performance.andP;  The test file was 4 MB in size--notparticularly large as color images go.andP;  On LocalTalk, the file took 3 minutesto move from one machine to another in the middle of the night, 6 minutesduring the day when other network activity was happening.andP;  Switching toEthernet reduced the times, but only fractionally.andP;  The nighttime transfertook 1-2/3 minutes on Ethernet, and the daytime one took 4-1/2 minutes.andO;Clearly, network bottlenecks are a real possibility.andM;* Halftoning performance.andP;  PostScript imagers can be a bottleneck too.andO;Halftoning a 5-MB file took 20 to 30 minutes on various Linotype andVarityper devices and 85 minutes on a Compugraphic 9600.andM;* Scanner quality.andP;  Desktop scanners are getting better, but they still havetheir limitations.andP;  These include lack of dynamic range (resulting inflat-looking scans), limited color gamut (resulting in some similar colorsbeing recorded as identical), and improper handling of metameric colors(resulting in some colors the eye sees as identical being recorded asdifferent).andP;  There is still no accepted standard for how colors should berepresented on the computer, so different scanners provide different (butequally valid) data for the same image.andM;* Halftoning quality.andP;  Researchers are still experimenting with screenangles, resolutions and spot functions to provide good results and eliminatemoire.andP;  Questions about the applicability of Hell's halftone patents remain.andO;The new generation of machines is less likely to show the banding problemsthat have plagued some imagesetters.andM;* Halftone calibration.andP;  The output device must be calibrated faithfully atleast once a day, and changes must be compensated for.andP;  This process involvesreading test films with a densitometer.andP;  In one case, an L-300 produced 6-15%larger dots before calibration than it should have, based on the requestedscreen destiny in the test file.andP;  Similar problems occur with other devices.andM;Templeman emphasized the need for training and for easy-to-use colorsoftware.andM;But is this really desktop publishing?andP;  No, answers Templeman, this isprofessional publishing using desktop tools.andP;  The cost ($100,000 to $150,000for a color setup), the training and personnel needed, and the attention todetails such as calibration mean that the casual user--key to the success ofblack-and-white desktop publishing--is not going to be involved with colorseparation.andM;Quality issuesandM;John-in-the-box.andP;  John Hammond wryly described how he had returned to Englandfrom the Seybold Seminars a year ago, full of excitement about the potentialof desktop color.andP;  He had set up a desktop color system in rented spaceinside a conventional color house.andP;  He had an arrangement with his landlordfor the exchange of information and expertise.andM;Hammond came to realize that there was one missing element in his system thattechnological advances could not cure.andP;  It was the expertise embodied in&quot;John,&quot; the operator of the conventional color scanner in the neighboringcolor shop.andM;John knew how to evaluate transparencies and see exactly how they had to beadjusted in the scanning process.andP;  He could take several poorly shot candidsof movie stars stepping out of limousines and make them look reasonablybalanced when printed together on a page.andP;  He could make colors in the firstpicture of a soccer match (taken in sunlight by a clear-headed photographer)look like those of the last one (taken late in the day, under lights andafter a few beers).andP;  He knew how to make fleshtones look like fleshtones(even when they didn't in the original photo) and he could make theadjustment without turning the grass blue.andM;All of these areas were problems for Hammond's desktop group.andP;  But theproblems weren't with equipment.andP;  When John tried his hand at the desktopequipment, things came out fine.andP;  The problem was that the desktop grouplacked John's experience and his eye for color.andP;  John had developed thesequalities through long apprenticeship and he was well compensated for hiscraft.andP;  What was needed on the desktop was a &quot;John-in-the-box,&quot; a magicalsource of built-in color craft knowlege.andM;Alas, a John-in-the-box is not offered, even as an option, on any desktopsystems; and it doesn't seem likely that it ever will be.andP;  Hammond decided toabandon the desktop approach and to offer customers the Scitex Visionarysystem instead.andM;Which color space?andP;  Jacob Aizikowitz, of Electronics for Imaging (EFI), gavea closer look at the various device-independent color spaces.andP;  These arebased on the way the human eye perceives color, rather than the way color isscanned by an input scanner or rendered by a particular output device.andM;The basis for device-independent color was created by a series of colorexperiments in the years after Worl War I.andP;  These experiments, conducted bythe international commission on illumination (Commission Internationale del'Echairage, or CIE), led to the notion of a &quot;standard observer&quot;--actuallythe average of a number of test subjects--whose color vision could bedescribed in terms of the spectral sensitivity of the red, green, and bluereceptors in his eyes.andM;Using the CIE standard, colors can be specified using three numbers.andP;  In theinitial CIE scheme, however, it was not possible to tell from these numbershow similar two colors were.andP;  The system lacked &quot;perceptual uniformity.&quot;andO;Later systems, including CIELAB and CIELUV, correct this shortcoming and canbe used to create perceptually based color image files.andM;Scanners could be calibrated to produce image files coded in thisdevice-independent, visually based way.andP;  Any properly calibrated monitor oroutput device could then render the image without knowledge of its source.andO;That would be portable color.andM;To date there is no standard for this type of portable image file.andP;  One isbadly needed.andM;In response to a question, Aizikowitz acknowledged that the RGB color space,used now in a nonstandard way by scanners and monitors, could be carefullydefined and tied to the CIE standards.andP;  An RGB standard is appealing becauseit would be immediately displayable on a CRT.andP;  If the CRT conformed exactlyto the standardized RGB, the display would be accurate.andP;  but an RGB colorspace has the disadvantage (like the original CIE space) of not beingperceptually uniform.andP;  This means that if you wanted to do accurate colorchanges on the monitor, the calculational burden imposed on the user wouldnegate the value of the simplicity sought by using RGB.andM;Performance issuesandM;Performance--how quickly things get done--has not been a priority in thedesktop world.andP;  Getting functionality into the software (and onto the specsheet, though not always in that sequence) has been the focus for mostvendors.andP;  For many features, implementation efficiency is  not too critical,especially for the casual user.andM;With color, however, efficiency looms large.andP;  Text files are measured in tensof kilobytes, and an extra second per kilobyte for a text function (such assearching or justifying text) results in only a few seconds of delay.andP;  Colorimage files, on the other hand, can be tens of megabytes.andP;  When processingsuch a file, an extra second per kilobyte can mean several extra hours ofcompute time.andP;  Even the most casual user would balk at that!andM;Compression.andP;  File compression is the first line of defense against hugefiles.andP;  One company that has been working with compression of color files isEFI, which will provided compression software to work with compression chipsand boards as they become available.andM;The first such chip, from C-Cube Microsystems, has just become available.andO;C-Cube cofounder Adriaan Ligtenberg talked in his presentation about themethod of compression used by the chip.andM;The chip adheres to a new standard (not yet formally adopted, but close)called JPEG.andP;  This approach uses the compression method called &quot;discretecosine transform&quot; to remove much of the redundant data from a color image.andO;The changes are calculated to be difficult for the eye to detect.andP;  (A summaryof the approach appeared in the Seybold Report on Publishing Systems, Vol.andO;19, No.andP;  1.)andP;  It works on blocks of an image, 7 pixels square.andM;The JPEG approach can result in compressions between 10X and 20X withoutsignificant visual change.andP;  But the time required for software to compress afile is excessive for most applications.andP;  That is why the C-Cube chip isimportant: it permits very rapid compression and decompression of an image,typically in a second or two.andM;With chips like this, plus some standards for how compressed files should bestored, it will be possible to store large image files on floppies, to movethem around on networks, and to transmit them over telephone lines withoutthe performance penalties these steps now entail.andM;Compression will not affect times for most image manipulation operations,however, because the files will have to be decompressed before themanipulations can be performed.andP;  Speed improvements in computers and programsfor displaying and manipulating images will still be needed.andM;Ligtenberg (who left C-Cube in December to form an independent company)believes that there are a number of tricks that can be played within the JPEGstandard that will be of particular help for high-resolution publishingapplications.andM;One of these tricks will be to compress different parts of the image bydifferent amounts: lower compression ratios (and hence less quality loss) forareas that contain critical subject elemets, higher compression ratios forimage portions that contain less important elements.andM;Ligtenberg noted that even better compression processes will eventuallyappear.andP;  It will be a while, however, before they are standardized andincorporated into chips.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
