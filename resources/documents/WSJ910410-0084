The company added that it would be mid-May before it couldestimate total costs related to the explosion, and about aslong before the Air Force will have determined the cause ofthe blast. Hercules officials indicated the company iscurtailing work that could be directly affected by the AirForce investigation until the Air Force releases its findingson the explosion and determines what, if any, parts orproduction processes need to be modified.</LP><TEXT>   News of the explosion sent Hercules's stock plunging April2 to $36 a share from $41.25 at the previous day's close. Thestock hasn't recovered from that pummeling, closing yesterdayat $33.75, down 87.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchangecomposite trading.   Thomas Gossage, Hercules chairman and chief executiveofficer since Jan. 1, met with Wall Street analysts yesterdayand tried to put the best face possible on the company'soperations. He said that &quot;except for any possible impact ofthe Titan incident,&quot; first-quarter earnings were in line withWall Street expectations.   Many analysts have estimated the Wilmington, Del., companyearned 65 cents to 70 cents a share in the first quarter,compared with year-earlier operating earnings of 72 cents ashare.   George Krug, an analyst with Oppenheimer andamp; Co. in NewYork, said Mr. Gossage told a small group of analysts afterthe meeting that the company, in light of the explosion,might have to increase somewhat the reserve establishedearlier to cover the cost of the booster program.   Mr. Gossage said he was limited in what he could tell theanalysts, in part because he hadn't cleared the meeting withthe Air Force or Martin Marietta Corp., the prime contractorfor the Titan IV project.   Separately, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said it placedHercules's about $600 million in long-term debt on itsCreditWatch list with negative implications. The explosionlast week will &quot;further postpone the realization of improvedprofitability that has been anticipated&quot; by Hercules, Sandamp;Psaid.   Mr. Gossage had been relatively upbeat about the prospectsfor the engine-booster test in meetings with analysts inFebruary. After hearing Mr. Gossage, some analystsrecommended the stock in February to clients based on thelikelihood of a successful rocket-booster test.   The explosion, which didn't result in any injuries, is thelatest setback for the company's Titan IV business. In 1989,the company wrote off more than $200 million as a result ofcost overruns and delays tied to development of the Titan IVbooster.   Last year, Hercules's aerospace division &quot;experiencedtechnical and operational setbacks,&quot; according to thecompany's annual report.   Hercules's solid-fuel engine is designed to boost by 25%the payload unmanned rockets can carry into Earth orbit toaccommodate the Air Force's need for heavier, moresophisticated spy satellites.   The company also said it laid off an additional 120employees at its Bacchus Works rocket engine plant in Utah.But a spokesman said the cuts were planned previously andweren't related to the booster explosion at Edwards Air ForceBase in Southern California.   The latest cutbacks bring to 520, or about 12% of the4,400 workers at the plant, the employees who have beendismissed because of the slowdown in defense spending, thecompany said.   While focusing on its own rocket operations, Hercules saidit plans to sell its nearly 20% stake in Orbital SciencesCorp., a Fairfax, Va., rocket maker, as part of a publicstock offering planned by Orbital Sciences. Hercules paidslightly more than $20 a share for its about 1.6 millionshares in Orbital Sciences and, depending on the offeringprice set in coming weeks, expects to book a &quot;small gain&quot;from the sale, a spokesman said.   Hercules has said that it intends to sell certaininvestments in other companies and joint ventures to focus onits core chemical and aerospace businesses.</TEXT></DOC>
