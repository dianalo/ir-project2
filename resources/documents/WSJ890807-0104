Dorfman@  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL><DD> 08/07/89 </DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) </IN><TEXT>   You say that stock you bought for $40 a share suddenly slid to $33.50, even though the company reported higher earnings?    Maybe it is because earnings rose only to 70 cents a share when analysts were expecting 90 cents.    If so, you've been slammed by an &quot;earnings surprise.&quot;    Fortunately, surprises can also be positive when better-than-expected earnings give a stock a boost.    Taking advantage of earnings surprises -- buying stocks that offer pleasant surprises and dumping those that surprise on the downside -- can raise an investor's gross return by anywhere from 2.5% to 16% a year, several studies show.    But while professional investors have been making money on surprises for years, many individual investors haven't been so lucky. That is because individuals have lacked the pros' easy access to analysts' earnings estimates.    Starting today, The Wall Street Journal is introducing a new feature designed to help even the odds. The feature is a listing of selected companies that report quarterly earnings substantially different from what stock market analysts have been estimating during the past 30 days and 300 days.    The listing will be published frequently, as warranted by the number of significant surprises. It will accompany the Digest of Earnings, (See accompanying illustration -- WSJ Aug. 7, 1989). (Companies in the surprise listing won't necessarily appear in that edition's Digest of Earnings.)    Earnings surprises are perhaps &quot;the most important type of new information&quot; that can quickly change investor expectations about a stock, says Leonard Zacks, president of Zacks Investment Research Inc. The Chicago-based stock-market research firm, which provides the data for the new feature, follows earnings estimates by some 2,500 analysts at 145 brokerage houses.    Several studies show that earnings surprises tend to push the price of a stock up or down, not only on the day of the announcement, but for days and even weeks afterward. Furthermore, a company with an earnings surprise in one quarter has a better-than-random chance of offering a similar surprise in the next quarter. Richard J. Rendleman Jr., professor of finance at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, was one of the pioneering researchers in the field of earnings surprises. During the 1970s, he says, stocks of companies showing the most extreme surprises outperformed {or underperformed} the market by 3 to 4 percentage points over the 90 days following the earnings announcement.    Interestingly, the same stocks also outperformed {or underperformed} the market by another three to four percentage points during the 20-day period ending with the announcement day. The pre-announcement moves, Mr. Rendleman figures, partly reflect investors' making shrewd guesses about what earnings will be. And in part, he and others say, it probably reflects leakage of information before the earnings announcement.    Even without guessing surprises in advance, however, a person who captures the after-effect could theoretically make an extra 12% to 16% a year, judging by Mr. Rendleman's figures. Add that to the average 9% return for stocks over the decades, and it looks like an easy way to make 21% to 25% a year.    Unfortunately, Mr. Rendleman hastens to say, it isn't that simple. He suspects that the magnitude of the effect has diminished a bit, now that so many investors follow earnings news so closely. And, he cautions, &quot;there are significant transactions costs with a strategy that follows earnings surprises.&quot;    Indeed, using earnings surprises as a stock-picking tool raises portfolio turnover &quot;about 2.5 to 3 times,&quot; says Jon T. Ender, chief investment officer at Chicago Corp. Turnover in portfolios using the technique averages 100%-125% a year, he says.    For Mr. Ender, whose firm manages $1.2 billion, the additional brokerage commissions generated by all that trading are a nuisance but not a big burden -- especially since the trading seems clearly worthwhile. Mr. Ender estimates that buying on positive surprises and selling on negative ones adds about five percentage points a year to the firm's returns.    Frequent trading is more costly for individual investors. Many small investors pay commissions ranging from 1% to 3% of the value of their trades. For them, trading enough to turn the portfolio over once a year could cost 2% to 6% of assets each year.    Nevertheless, even small investors might benefit from paying attention to earnings surprises, professionals say. Besides the short-term performance effect, there is also the chance that one good surprise will lead to another. On Wall Street, it's called the &quot;cockroach effect&quot; -- you rarely see just one.    The odds of a repeat surprise were calculated by Melissa Brown, chief quantitative analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Over a recent four-year period, she found, 36% of the companies whose earnings were most above analysts' expectations in a given quarter repeated the feat in the subsequent quarter.    Companies with earnings that are a lot worse than expected also tend to give encore performances. After a negative surprise, says Chicago Corp.'s Mr. Ender, &quot;both the company and many of those following the company think these problems are temporary. But often they reflect competitive disadvantages or problems that take many years to fix.&quot;    Not everyone is convinced that the surprise effect is long-lasting. That may have once been the case, but it isn't any more, says Pamela Peterson, associate professor of finance at Florida State University. She says that recent research by her and two graduate students, John Alexander and Delbert Goff, found that stocks move significantly only in a short period surrounding an earnings announcement.    Moreover, some successful investors don't care about earnings surprises because they use strategies that aren't earnings-driven. &quot;We're trying to get a dollar's worth of assets for 50 cents,&quot; says S. Edward Moore, a principal with the New York money-management firm Moore, Grossman andamp; DeRose Inc. Accordingly, he pays little attention to earnings surprises -- and sometimes views a negative surprise as a buying opportunity. &quot;We're happy to pick up the stock if the street is going to throw it away,&quot; he says.    Still, most Wall Streeters believe the weight of the evidence says there is money to be made from following surprises. Jack Rivkin, director of research for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., says earnings surprises were one of the best predictors of stock gains in 1988, and in most other recent years.    &quot;When we see surprises on earnings, that is very significant,&quot; Mr. Rivkin says. &quot;That means something is going on with the company that we didn't understand, or the world didn't understand.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
