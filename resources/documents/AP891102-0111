President F.W. de Klerk and top members of his governmentinsisted the South-West Africa People Organization had plans todisrupt elections in Namibia next week that are a step toward theterritory's independence from South Africa.   ``SWAPO's hands are anything but clean,'' de Klerk said in aspeech.   Foreign Minister Pik Botha said Wednesday that South Africa hadplaced its troops on alert and was prepared to delay the Nov. 7-11elections due to an alleged incursion into northern Namibia bySWAPO guerrillas based in Angola. Botha said member of the U.N.monitoring force reported in internal radio traffic theinfiltration of 600 guerrillas from Oct. 26-31.   Fred Eckhard, a U.N. spokesman in Namibia, said however that themessages ``are phony in content and format.''   He said U.N. communications experts and military personnelexamined the information provided by South African officials anddetermined that ``the messages do not emanate from any (U.N.)source.''   Eckhard declined to say whether the United Nations believed theSouth Africans fabricated the radio messages themselves or werevictims of a hoax.   Northern Namibia was calm Thursday, Eckhard said. U.N. soldiersand territorial police were conducting regular patrols along theNamibia-Angola border and had not reported any evidence of anincursion.   Eckhard also said the U.N. force had no evidence of SWAPOguerrillas deploying near the Namibian border in southernmostAngola.   However, South Africa's armed forces chief, Gen. JannieGeldenhuys, and its territorial administrator in Namibia, LouisPienaar, both said there were large numbers of guerrillas insouthern Angola in violation of an accord requiring them to havemoved farther north.   SWAPO's secretary for information, Hidipo Hamutanya, rejectedthe South African claims, saying: ``The whole thing is asmokescreen by South Africa to influence the outcome of theelections.''   Hamutenya said SWAPO had 300 guerrillas still in Angola, butthey were far north of the border and in compliance with allinternational agreements.   SWAPO maintained bases in Angola during its 23-year war againstSouth African rule, but is not supposed to have armed personnelnear the border or in Namibia during the transitional period.   Under the U.N.'s independence plan, South Africa has withdrawnvirtually all of its troops from Namibia, and law enforcementduties are being carried out by the territorial police force.   On April 1, the official start of the transitional period, SouthAfrica said hundreds of SWAPO guerrillas had crossed into Namibiafrom Angola in violation of international agreements. About 280guerrillas and 27 members of the security forces were killed insubsequent fighting, according to South Africa, which received U.N.permission to deploy its troops against SWAPO.   SWAPO is favored to get the most votes in the election for seatsin an assembly that will draft a constitution for Namibia, whichhas been ruled by South Africa since 1915. It would need two-thirdsof the vote to have complete control over the drafting process.   The treaty that paved the way for independence also calls forCuba to remove its 50,000 soldiers from Marxist-ruled Angola. Cubaannounced earlier this week that 25,000 of the troops had left onschedule.</TEXT></DOC>
