It was the third strategy shift in the 1980s for the bigcomputer company, formally known as International Business MachinesCorp. Almost a third of big industrial companies have changed threetimes in the decade, and 50 percent twice.   In IBM's case, it went after high costs with a plan to save $1billion a year by eliminating 10,000 jobs and consolidatingmanufacturing facilities. It sought to support IBM stock with abuyback of up to $4 billion in shares.   Rather than indicating that companies have lost their way, suchmoves illustrate the vast technological, strategic, financial andother forces that are making and remaking marketplaces.   The latest spate of restructurings began in 1986 and is far morecomplex than any that preceded it, according to Prof. EugeneJennings, who has studied corporate changes for 35 years andadvised executives on how to handle them.   In strategic planning today, he says, four elements serve as aplanning matrix. Two of them, market forces and share value, areexternally oriented; two, core technology-expertise and financialresources are internal.   These four strategical planning elements, he states, are mostcommonly found in today's restructurings, since all play vitalroles in refocusing efforts on the new and developing realities ofthe marketplace.   1. Marketing. The big change is that corporations are findingthey must give equal attention to three growing markets: America,Europe and Asia. It creates a need to balance operating assetsaround three markets, not one.   2. Share Value. Corporations are realizing that discounted cashflow _ what's left over at the end of the year after payingexpenses _ is more important than officially reported earnings inattracting investor attention.   In Jennings' opinion, the investing public is aware thatearnings are too easily manipulated to disguise weaknesses in acompany. Cash flow, discounted for the cost of capital, isconsidered a more reliable indicator of health.   Companies are, of course, concerned about the price of theirshares. A higher than average price for shares provides a financialadvantage over the competition.   3. Core Technology and Expertise. These, says Jennings, ``mustbe preserved at all costs.'' Preserving them is not easy, since thehardnosed competitive atmosphere and changing markets mean they areconstantly under attack.   A common situation today, for example:   A company whose core technology and expertise is to supplywidgets doesn't have the luxury of continuing to make only widgetswhen the marketplace demands widgets encased in a larger system. Itmust learn to make the system.   Among manufacturers, subsystems of several components are``in.'' For one thing, they may be easier to assemble, service, andreplace. The widget-maker and supplier must protect his widgetexpertise by encasing it in a system.   4. Financial Resources. This concerns the extent to which acompany has access to debt financing and equity capital and at whatcost. The lower the better, of course.   Among other things, this places a premium on maintaining theshare price of stock. Buybacks of outstanding shares is one way todo it. Even before its latest buyback, IBM had set aside $6.4billion for such purposes since 1986.   Jennings, a Michigan State University professor of business andadviser to top corporate managers, sees these four elements in arestless mix that makes strategic planning good for only two tofour years.   The message is a harsh one for companies accustomed to a slowerpace, but he sees no escape from the rapid rate of change.Companies simply cannot stay put in their thinking; theirenvironment is not static. They must restructure.   An illustration of this can be found in the experience of the 40``excellent'' companies chosen early in the decade by author TomPeters for his book, ``In Search of Excellence.''   All but eight of the 40, according to Jennings' count, have beenthrough two restructurings since they were deemed excellent.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thursday, Dec. 7.</NOTE></DOC>
