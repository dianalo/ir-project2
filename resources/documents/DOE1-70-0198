The coupled-wave equations describing the interactionof four optical fields in an absorbing medium have been solved previouslyfor the case of no pump depletion and no self-action of any of the beams.When studying phase conjugation oscillation, however, the effect of depletionof the pump beams on the phase conjugate reflectivity must be considered.Moreover, in absorbing media the self-action effects are always present.The coupled-wave equations, including the self-action terms for all fourwaves involved, are derived here for the first time to the authors' knowledge.For the case of small absorption, these equations are solved analytically,and the effect of pump depletion on phase conjugate reflectivity R isdetermined. In the absence of the pump depletion, R is proportional totan/sup 2/(Ql), where Ql is a dimensionless gain parameter characterizingthe nonlinear medium and the input pump power. When pump depletion andself-action are included, R does not go to infinity when Ql equals oddmultiples of {pi}/2. Instead R takes on values dependent on the proberatio q/sub 1/, which is the ratio of the input probe irradiance to theinput pump irradiance. The authors find that the maximum value for Ris 1/q/sub 1/. They also find that for Ql close to odd multiples of {pi}/2,the reflectivity is significantly reduced from the value obtained byignoring pump depletion, even for probe ratios as small as one-tenthof 1%. Experimental confirmation of this theory, using an argon-ion laseras the pump and carbon tetrachloride mixed with a dye as the absorbingmedium, is in progress and is reported.</TEXT></DOC>
