The HHS inspector general, in his semiannual report to Congress, suggested garnishment of Social Security checks for beneficiaries who don't pay their share of Medicare hospital costs.    The department also could change its policy and refuse to make payments for those in arrears, according to Inspector General Richard Kusserow.    &quot;This really is the patient's responsibility,&quot; said Larry Simmons, a deputy assistant inspector general.    Attaching Social Security benefits would require congressional approval, and the idea still needs to be approved by HHS before it becomes a formal proposal. But HHS officials believe they could refuse to pay Medicare bad debts administratively, through the regulation process.    The inspector general's proposal could face tough opposition in Congress, however. Edward Roybal (D., Calif.), chairman of the House Select Committee on Aging, said the plan would hit &quot;America's poorest, sickest and least protected elderly and disabled.&quot; A spokeswoman for Sen. John Heinz (R., Pa.), chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, said he opposes the proposal because it would place the federal government in the position of hospital bill collector, and in most cases would deprive recipients of their only source of income.    Medicare patients pay a $492 deductible for their first day of hospital care, a $123 payment after the 60th day of hospitalization, and the entire hospital bill incurred after the 150th day. Medicare pays all hospital charges from the second day through the 150th. Over a five-year period, the federal government pays $1.2 billion in Medicare bad debts.    For 20 years, the department has had a policy of reimbursing hospitals if their efforts to collect from Medicare patients failed. The policy was designed to prevent the cost of caring for Medicare recipients from being shifted to other patients.    Mr. Kusserow's report said, &quot;the original intent of reimbursing hospitals for bad debts no longer seems appropriate.&quot; Now, according to the inspector general, &quot;there is a trend for hospitals to waive&quot; the $492 and $123 payments in order to induce beneficiaries to stay in the hospitals.    Theresa Varner of the American Association of Retired Persons said those affected by the inspector general's proposal would be &quot;people of extremely limited means.&quot; She also said she is concerned about the method that would be used to garnishee Social Security checks. If a person survives only on Social Security benefits, &quot;a one-time hit would have tremendous consequences,&quot; she said.    Ms. Varner said the association hasn't yet studied the proposal in detail. But she said that any program deducting from Social Security payments should have an appeals process to protect patients from automatic deductions when the amount owed may be in dispute.    Clay Mikel of the American Hospital Association said the proposal to stop bad debt reimbursements &quot;would certainly pose a problem&quot; for hospitals. The inspector general, he said, exaggerates hospital profits. Mr. Mikel also criticized HHS for what he called a &quot;real trend&quot; of making government health policy through regulation rather than legislation. </TEXT></DOC>
