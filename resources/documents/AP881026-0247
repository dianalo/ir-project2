Members of Congress, after passing the first legislative responseto the wave of insider trading scandals that erupted two years ago,are hoping to replace the motto with another _ ``Greed isdangerous.''   ``Greed and fear are competing emotions, but until now there hasnot been a proper balance between the two. I think now the fear ofapprehension is going to be at least as great as the lure ofgreed,'' said Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chief sponsor of thebill and chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees thesecurities markets.   The bill passed the House 410-0 last month and by a voice vote inthe Senate early Saturday morning in the waning hours of the 100thCongress. The securities industry's chief lobby group acquiesced tothe legislation and President Reagan is expected to sign it.   Its key provisions would:   _Increase the maximum criminal penalties for insider trading fromfive years in jail to 10 years, and boost fines from $500,000 to$2.5 million for a company and from $100,000 to $1 million for anindividual.   _Hold firms liable to fines for the actions of their employees ifthe firms ``knowingly or recklessly'' fail to detect and preventinsider trading.   _Authorize the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer abounty to tipsters of up to 10 percent of any fine collected.   _Codify the right of investors to sue inside traders if they lostmoney by trading in the same securities and at the same time asinsiders.   _Permit the SEC to issue subpoenas and investigate inside tradingon behalf of foreign countries, with the idea that foreign countrieswould offer reciprocal privileges to the United States.   The SEC and the industry had been pushing for a legislativedefinition of inside trading, which until now has been defined byregulators and the courts.   But, to win the support of House Energy and Commerce ChairmanJohn Dingell, D-Mich., the bill leaves inside trading undefined.   Dingell believes a written definition would in effect become aroad map to evasion, providing defense attorneys with loopholes. Theindustry complains it is unfair to give only vague guidance.   Markey predicted the most immediate effect of the bill will be tochange the attitude toward insider trading, a crime that is bothhard to detect and difficult to prove.   ``Jail is the greatest fear these white collar criminals have,''Markey said. In addition, firms, because of the new liabilityprovisions, ``can't be like the three monkeys and say just becausethey are deaf, dumb and blind they can get off,'' he said.   John C. Baldwin, president of the North American SecuritiesAdministrators Association, an organization of state regulators,said he hopes the most immediate psychological effect will be onsmall investors who have been scared out of the market by theperception that the little guy can't get a fair deal trading in thesame stocks as big-time arbitragers.   ``If John Q. Public feels like he's the only guy not making aprofit and the inside traders are cutting all the good deals, he'sgoing to take his business elsewhere. The first thing this bill doesis give the individual investor the feeling that someone cares abouthim,'' he said.   The impact from provisions granting individuals the right to sueinsiders and offering bounties to informers may take longer toemerge, but ultimately could be more profound.   ``We're in a litigious society. If people or their lawyers canfind a way to go after deep pockets, they'll usually do it,'' saidEdward I. O'Brien, president of the Securities Industry Association.   At the urging of the SIA, Markey made the threshold for suingfirms _ the knowing or reckless clause _ tougher than originallyproposed.   The SIA also has reservations about the bounties, as does SECChairman David S. Ruder, who has said juries may not believe awitness who was paid a bounty.   ``It's somehow a little offensive to me. It's a little bit in theBig Brother tradition,'' O'Brien said.   But Markey argues that bounties have worked well for the IRS incatching tax cheats and, he said, he is working on a plan to offerRuder an incentive to use bounties despite his qualms.   The SEC under Ruder has sought more money to hire additionalenforcement attorneys. Markey said next year he'd like to find a wayto give the agency a cut of any extra fine revenue that is producedby offering bounties.</TEXT></DOC>
