Meantime, six Democrats are battling in their primary, promptedby the decision of the popular incumbent, Lawton Chiles, not toseek re-election. An October runoff will be necessary if, asexpected, no one gets more than half the votes on Tuesday.   Seven of Florida' 19 congressional districts are also holdingprimaries.   Raising funds has been the dominant topic of the Senate races,two years after then-Gov. Bob Graham unseated Republican Sen. PaulaHawkins in a race that cost them a combined $13 million.   Chiles, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, stunned statepoliticians with his decision in December not to seek a fourthterm. Chiles said he was burned out by his Senate workload and thehigh cost of campaigns.   Rep. Connie Mack III, a three-term Republican, had already begunpiling up funds when Chiles dropped out. Mack, whose lategrandfather managed the Philadelphia A's and is in Baseball's Hallof Fame, has spent at least $2.2 million so far.   Democrats were pleased when former Gov. Reubin Askew announcedhis candidacy. But Askew, though running well ahead of Mack in thepolls, abruptly quit May 7, saying he didn't like all the timespent raising funds.   Askew's withdrawal left Rep. Dan Mica the only Democrat tooppose Mack. But quickly, five others entered the race: three-termstate Insurance Commissioner Bill Gunter, Rep. Kenneth ``Buddy''MacKay, state Sen. Patricia Frank, former Republican Gov. ClaudeKirk and former Senate postal clerk Fred Rader.   Mack got a surprise of his own when Robert Merkle, fresh fromgaining the conviction of Colombian cocaine kingpin Carlos LehderRivas, quit as U.S. attorney and entered the Republican race inJune.   President Reagan and former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North madecampaign appearances for Mack, a 47-year-old with one of the mostconservative records in Congress.   The outspoken Merkle, also a conservative, has likened Mack to a``shiny new car'' with ``no engine under the hood.'' When Mackrefused to debate him, Merkle started carrying around a life-sizedreplica of Mack he called ``Cardboard Connie.''   However, he did not make an issue of Mack's admission last yearthat he had used marijuana in his younger days.   Merkle, 43, has spent only about $100,000 but has garnered morenewspaper endorsements that credit him with more specific stands onissues than Mack.   Still, published polls make Mack the heavy favorite to win theGOP nomination, and his well-financed campaign and the dividedcampaign on the Democratic side give him a good chance ofprevailing in November.   ``I don't think it'll be an easy race, but I think it'swinnable,'' said State Democratic Chairman Charles Whitehead.   In the Democratic primary, polls give Gunter the lead with about40 percent of the vote. A candidate needs to top 50 percent toavert a runoff Oct. 4.   Gunter, who lost to Mrs. Hawkins in 1980, raised $1 millionwithin six weeks of entering the race, and opponents noted he tookat least $160,000 from the insurance industry he regulates as stateinsurance commissioner. MacKay campaign manager Greg Farmer calledGunter's department ``a saga of sleaze.''   Polls indicated the race for second was too close to callbetween MacKay, a three-term congressman, and Mica, a five-termcongressman.   In the congressional races, 10th-term Rep. Bill Chappell,touched by the Pentagon procurement scandal, faced a little-knownengineer in the Democratic primary, while three Republicans arevying for the chance to challenge him. Chappell has deniedwrongdoing, although his name has been mentioned repeatedly duringthe probe.   Six Republicans are battling to succeed Mack. Former Rep. L.A.``Skip'' Bafalis, who gave up the seat in an unsuccessful run forgovernor in 1982, was expected to be in a runoff with former LeeCounty Commissioner Porter Goss or retired Army Gen. James Dozier,who was held hostage by terrorists in Italy.</TEXT></DOC>
