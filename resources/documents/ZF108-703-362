National Weather Service.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Forecasts Will Change With the WeatherandM;Unprecedented amounts of weather data soon will begin flowing to NationalWeather Service field offices from NEXRAD Doppler radars, weather satellitesand automated observation devices.andM;If all goes as planned, the Commerce Department will award a contract earlynext year for hardware to pull all this data together under the $500 millionAdvanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS).andM;&quot;AWIPS really integrates all the technologies,&quot; said Louis J. Boezi, NWSdeputy assistant administrator for the modernization program.andP;  &quot;It will helpa forecaster analyze what is happening in the atmosphere and prepareforecasts and warnings.&quot;andM;Because an AWIPS design competition is under way between Computer SciencesCorp. and Planning Research Corp., Boezi would not give specific detailsabout the platform.andM;&quot;My guess is that it will be a supermini, a RISC-type machine from IBM[Corp.] or a Sun [Microsystems Inc.]-type workstation,&quot; he said.andP;  Bothcompanies are expected to submit detailed proposals of their designs thismonth.andM;AWIPS also will have a communications network linking all field offices over56-kilobit/sec lines.andP;  Satellite imagery and data generated by the NationalMeteorological Center's supercomputers will be able to travel to fieldoffices via 2-megabit/sec lines, far higher than the present speed of 2,400bits/sec.andM;Weather Service field offices are equipped with Data General Corp. EclipseS230 minicomputers that Boezi called &quot;pretty archaic.&quot;andP;  Although the miniscame with 64K of core memory, &quot;they now are pretty hefty with 256K,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;We have very little data available in a forecast office today compared withwhat we are talking about for the future.andP;  Forecasters [now] have to spend alarge proportion of their time just preparing the reports to issue.&quot;andM;The Weather Service hopes AWIPS will change that.andP;  The design rule is thatAWIPS must present data quickly enough for a forecaster to make a decisionand issue a forecast within the life cycle of the weather phenomenon.andM;That may not sound difficult for large-scale weather patterns, butshort-lived phenomena like microbursts and wind shears present quite achallenge.andP;  In recent field experiments with new equipment, researchers saythey have observed phenomena they never were able to deal with before.andM;&quot;We have seen thunderstorms go from no indication at all, to a fullydeveloped thunderstorm, back to no indication at all -- within 10 to 15minutes,&quot; Boezi said.andM;&quot;AWIPS has to detect it, judge what is happening, prepare a warning and issueit before the thing is over.andP;  There is nothing worse than an old weatherforecast.&quot;andM;Depending on funding, NWS officials said the winning AWIPS contractor couldbegin a two-year development phase next year, fielding 10 prototypes for ayear-long demonstration in Kansas and nearby states.andM;&quot;We'll outfit those stations, reconfigure the staffs, run the demonstrationand collect statistics on how well it performs,&quot; Boezi said.andP;  The NationalAcademy of Sciences will conduct an assessment as a check.andM;Another major part of the $2 billion National Weather Service modernizationis automation of surface observations.andM;NWS and Federal Aviation Administration personnel now must make hourlyweather observations at more than 1,000 sites around the country.andM;&quot;Once an hour, somebody has to go read the dials and gauges and examine skyconditions,&quot; Boezi said.andM;When fully deployed, the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) will makeobservations once a minute at up to 2,000 sites nationwide.andM;&quot;After many years of trial and error, we can make a satisfactory automatedobservation.andP;  [But] it doesn't replace the human observation, the mind andintellect,&quot; Boezi said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
