The latest victims of the tort crisis are thousands of Americans who once volunteered to help out in the nation's public schools. Our absurd tort laws with their unlimited potential liability have snuffed out a once-bright point of light.    According to surveys by the American Tort Reform Association, nearly 60% of school principals say they have dropped or cut back on school-related programs because of the threat of lawsuits and high insurance premiums. Nearly 20% of school lawyers report lawsuits or settlements in the past two years alone that caused their schools to drop or restrict activities.    Hardest hit, say the school lawyers, was volunteerism, with more than one-tenth of schools either stopping or restricting volunteer work, such as driving or chaperoning, because of liability fears.    Not surprisingly, gym, cheerleading and diving are highly suspect activities in many schools these days. But so too are playground activities, field trips, vocational education, driver education, nurses stations and even recess. One school actually modified its drum and bugle corps program because of fear of litigation.    The Association of Trial Lawyers of America has an answer for all this. The plaintiff lawyers say the culprits are insurance companies &quot;reaping incredible profits&quot; from premiums and trying to &quot;pressure the public into thinking there is a crisis in tort law.&quot; The good news is that this game of contingency-fee lawyers attacking the messenger for bearing bad tort tidings may be just about over.    Lawyers for these schools have had to go to court to defend against all kinds of absurd charges, from teachers giving low grades to a school allowing a thief to fall through its skylight at night. These legal costs are passed on to taxpayers, so you'd think that public officials would do all they could to put an end to this destructive litigation. Instead, the state attorneys general attacked the insurers with a frivolous lawsuit.    The National Association of Attorneys General -- known increasingly as the National Association of Aspiring Governors -- filed a massive antitrust claim accusing insurers of somehow concocting the tort crisis. A federal judge has announced that he plans to dismiss the lawsuit before trial. California Attorney General (and aspiring governor) John Van de Kamp, who plotted the lawsuit, must now take some responsibility for the higher insurance premiums sure to be passed on to consumers because of the monstrous legal bills insurers incurred over the past year defending themselves from the state AGs.    Society has become used to watching goods and services fall victim to the U.S.'s deep-pocket-picking liability system, but burdening the public schools with these liability suits is a special outrage. We need more parent volunteers to help teach and coach. We need more businessmen willing to offer school-related work to underclass youth. The last place we need to spend education money is on lawyers chasing the chimera of a risk-free environment.    Education, like almost every human pursuit, entails some measure of risk. Some kids inevitably will be hurt learning carpentry or playing basketball. But they'll be hurt more if plaintiffs' lawyers keep shutting down aspects of education. Judges and legislators should redouble their efforts to reform tort law before our schools become sterile hallways of risk aversion and boredom. </TEXT></DOC>
