However, the detection of early stagedisease can be seriously compromised by a poorly designed mammographysystem or a poorly executed study. There is a non-zero risk of inducingcancer from the mammographic radiation dose. The challenge, then, inmammography is to minimize the risk of radiation carcinogenesis whileensuring that the image contains sufficient information for accuratediagnosis. This paper covers factors affecting patient dose and imagequality in mammography. Consideration includes characteristics of x-rayunit design, detector systems, and processing. Typical exposure and doselevels associated with popular systems are explained and illustratedwith clinical images. Characteristics of the new xeroradiography system,new double screen-double emulsion film systems, and the effects of magnification,and of moving and stationary grids are discussed, along with clinicalexamples. Recent risk-benefit estimates and their implications for clinicalpractice are reviewed.</TEXT></DOC>
