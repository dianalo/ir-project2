(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hearings into a fatal train wreck raisedserious questions on working conditions and equipment safety in therail industry, a ranking National Transportation Safety Boardofficial said Friday.   James L. Kolstad, the board's vice chairman who's heading apanel investigating the Jan. 14 Conrail accident in Thompsontown,said new testimony and data from previous accidents ``clearlysuggest that irregular and unpredictable shift work isfatigue-producing and detrimental to safe railroad operations.''   The board will issue a report in about seven months on theaccident, in which two trains collided head-on, killing theengineer and brakeman on both.   Scheduling train dispatchers without work breaks also is unsafe,Kolstad said as three days of hearings concluded.   Early in the hearings, witnesses said dispatchers often cannotleave their computers to eat or go to the bathroom because no oneelse is experienced enough to relieve them.   R. B. Hasselman, a Conrail vice president, said the companyindeed promotes safety in its scheduling practices.   And Pat Linskey, a Conrail spokeswoman in Philadelphia, citedexhibits submitted to the board that the engineer and the brakemanon the one train that apparently ran a stop sign before theaccident both had had a break of nearly 38 hours since theirprevious work assignment.   An industrial psychologist said during the hearings that hereviewed the crew's work schedules and concluded they were overlytired and fell asleep while running the train.   Kolstad also called on the industry to improve the workingenvironment and safety of locomotive cabs, adding, ``Industrystudies have been under way for improvements in these areas withoutproducing significant results.''   He said a committee representing the interests of industry,unions and the federal government has failed to initiate anysubstantial safety changes in locomotive cabs.   Donald Lindsey, vice president of the Brotherhood of LocomotiveEngineers, said recommendations for important safety changes ``havefallen on deaf ears.''   Lindsey said train manufacturers should improve the interior cabby decreasing the noise level to prevent hearing loss, changing theheating and cooling systems, and padding the interior to betterprotect employees in case of an accident. He said locomotives alsoneed exterior changes such as stronger and larger crash equipmentand measures to prevent the cab from being crushed if it rolls overduring an accident.   ``The companies don't want to put the money out,'' Lindsey saidafter his testimony. ``It would range anywhere from $6,000 to$16,000 for each cab and the industry doesn't want to spend thatkind of money.   William Bogett, an official with General Motors, which makeslocomotives, said the committee on improving locomotive cabs iswell-intended but often makes recommendations that are unrealistic.   He said the committee has been ``asked to do the impossible'' _make a high-speed locomotive withstand the impact of anotherlocomotive.</TEXT></DOC>
