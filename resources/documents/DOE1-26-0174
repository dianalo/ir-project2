The coal combustion was studiedin unaugmented premixed pulverized coal flames. Vapor species were measuredby molecular beam mass spectrometry. Temperatures were also measured,and time-resolved coal/ash particulate samples were collected and analyzed.A major part of the research on this project was devoted to: (1) thedevelopment and refinement of techniques for the MBMS analysis of tracequantities of unstable and reactive high temperature vapor species fromthe pulverized coal flames; and (2) the time-resolved sampling and collectionof particulates. The equipment is now operating very satisfactorily.Inorganic species, some of which were present at parts-per-million levels,were quantitatively sampled and measured in the pulverized coal flames.Time-resolved particulate samples which were free of vapor depositedcontaminants were collected without the use of an interfering substrate.Profiles of the alkali metal species in Beulah lignite and Decker subbituminouscoal flames were obtained. It was found in both flames that sodium isvolatilized as the atomic species early (milliseconds) in the combustionprocess. The gaseous Na reacts, also in milliseconds, to form an unknownspecies which is probably an oxide fume, but which is not NaOH or Na{sub2}SO{sub 4}. This is probably the mechanism for the formation of thealkali &quot;fumes&quot; observed in other systems. Measurements were also madeof a number of other gaseous species, and time-resolved coal/ash sampleswere obtained and analyzed. 27 refs., 23 figs., 8 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
