The televised congressional hearings, along with the reports of the Senate intelligence committee and of President Reagan's own special review board, have produced some great theater and have revealed how heavily the administration relied on secrecy, deception and lies to carry out its policies on Iran, Nicaragua and terrorism.    But the administration, the Congress, and the press still haven't addressed two central questions that seem certain to outlive both the scandal and the investigations. First, how aggressively should the U.S. move to prevent the spread of communist influence in Central America? Second, how should the West try to curb Iranian-sponsored terrorism?    The hearings, says Sen. Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii), should provide lessons to Mr. Reagan's successor on how not to conduct foreign policy, but they won't help the next president much in coping with the two problems that have overwhelmed Mr. Reagan.    Nevertheless, White House officials think the hearings may be generating new public support for the Nicaraguan Contras. The administration is hoping to capitalize on the sudden popularity of Lt. Col. Oliver North and on the magnetic Marine's impassioned pleas for renewed aid to the Contras. The White House and the State Department are beginning a push for $105 million in Contra aid for fiscal 1988, and some officials want to ask for enough money, perhaps $150 million, to sustain the Contras through the end of Ronald Reagan's presidency in January, 1989.    Administration officials and supporters of Contra aid are taking heart from recent public opinion polls which indicate that Col. North's appearance before the House and Senate investigating committees not only made him an instant hero to many Americans, but also prompted some to change their mind about aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll taken at the end of Col. North's first week of testimony, for example, reported that 40% of those questioned supported aid to the Contras, compared with 32% in a similar poll taken in May. The same poll showed opposition to aiding the Contras slid from 54% in May to 43%.    But the shift in the polls may have more to do with personality than policy and the impact of Col. North's testimony probably will be transitory.    Asked what impact the televised Iran-Contra hearings will have on the way Congress votes on Contra aid, Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.), vice chairman of the Senate Iran-Contra panel and a supporter of aid to the insurgents, replied: &quot;I don't think it will have any.&quot; By the time the issue comes to a vote this fall, Sen. Rudman said, Col. North's compelling performance will be replaced by other images on the nation's television screens. &quot;Opinion on that issue has been like a yo-yo.&quot;    Still, Col. North's testimony represents a victory of sorts for the administration. Opponents of aid to the Contras had been hoping that exposing the administration's secret campaign to aid the Contras in defiance of Congress would doom the effort to topple the Sandinista regime.    Instead, American policy toward Nicaragua remains as it was before the covert aid to the Contras was exposed: &quot;weak and vacillating,&quot; in the words of Col. North. But that isn't because Congress and the media are riddled with quislings, as former national security adviser Adm. John Poindexter and others seem to suspect.    The administration, with help from Managua, has convinced the American people that the Sandinistas are a disease, but it has never convinced them that the illness is contagious or that the Contras are the cure. Now, the administration's secret policies are likely to polarize Congress and public opinion even further.    If the squabbling over Central American policy has been largely between the administration and Congress, the battle over how to fight terrorism has been fought mostly within Mr. Reagan's own National Security Council. But the results have been the same: Unable to end the feud between warriors and diplomats, the administration resorted to secret policies and offshore operations to win the freedom of American hostages and to carry on its war against terrorism.    As a result, the U.S. hasn't any more effective policy for dealing with outlaw nations such as Iran and Libya, or their surrogates, than it had when Ronald Reagan took office and promised America would never again be mugged by terrorists.    Sadly, neither the administration nor the Congress has shown much inclination to extract useful lessons from the debacle. Congress has been content to dwell on the administration's mistakes, while Mr. Reagan and his aides refuse to admit they made any. </TEXT></DOC>
