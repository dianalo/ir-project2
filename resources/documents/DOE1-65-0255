Unknown substances in the wastewater reduced the flotationefficiency of the metal sulfides. An estimated annual loss of 795,000lb Cu, 232,000 lb Mo, 5,625 tr oz Ag, and 617 tr oz Au would result fromrecycling the total flow from the lime treatment plant to the flotationmill in an effort to conserve water and reduce associated expense. Thetests indicated that aeration or treatment with activated carbon significantlyimproved the water quality. The improvements in molybdenum recovery averaged8% for aeration, 11% for activated carbon, and 16% for combined aerationand activated carbon. The combination of the two processes produced waterquality as good as or better than normal feed water.</TEXT></DOC>
