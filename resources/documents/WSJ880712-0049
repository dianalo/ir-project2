Fuji, an Elmsford, N.Y., unit of Fuji Photo Film Co. of Tokyo, will make the formal announcement today.    The Fuji account, which is expected to bill about $20 million annually, is Riney's third new piece of business in two months and brings the agency's annual billings to about $350 million. Just last week, Riney won $25 million in billings from Stroh Brewery Co., and in May General Motors Corp. gave Riney its Saturn account, expected to bill about $90 million to $100 million annually.    Fuji's advertising until now has been handled by two separate agencies. Lord, Geller Federico Einstein, a New York-based WPP Group PLC subsidiary, handles advertising for audio and videotapes; and McCann-Erickson Worldwide, an Interpublic Group of Cos. subsidiary, creates advertising for film and cameras. The two areas will be consolidated under Riney.    Competitors for Fuji's business besides Riney were DDB Needham Worldwide Inc., an Omnicom Group unit; D'Arcy, Masius, Benton andamp; Bowles Inc., and McCann-Erickson. </TEXT></DOC>
