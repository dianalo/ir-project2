So far, ATandamp;T hasn't filled in many of the variables in a complex equation, and is keeping quiet about its plans. &quot;We're not talking until decisions are made and agreements are signed,&quot; an ATandamp;T official says. &quot;Until then, we're going underground.&quot;    The telephone giant's entry is expected to accelerate development of the information-services business, and many in the industry are waiting to see whether ATandamp;T focuses on the business market or the mass market -- or both -- and whether it plans to wade in slowly or make a huge splash.    The way was cleared last week when a federal judge decided to allow the Aug. 24 expiration of a ban on ATandamp;T electronic publishing, which will enable ATandamp;T to offer a wide variety of services such as financial and securities data, videotex -- delivery of information to home television sets -- and news over the telephone lines.    ATandamp;T began testing the waters several months ago, and its representatives have talked with such information-services providers as Compuserve Inc., a unit of Handamp;R Block Inc., and Dow Jones andamp; Co., publisher of this newspaper, fueling speculation that ATandamp;T probably will form joint ventures rather than strike out on its own.    In an intriguing twist, ATandamp;T has acknowledged that it has held talks with Nintendo of America Inc., raising the possibility that computer game equipment would be used for distribution of some information services to residential customers.    The notion that ATandamp;T could make a grand entrance into electronic publishing, and the prospect that its entry will expand the whole industry by drawing in more customers from its vast pool of telephone users, initially propelled the stocks of several information-services companies. Those affected included Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp., Knight-Ridder Inc., Telerate Inc., which is 67%-owned by Dow Jones, McGraw-Hill Inc., Reuters Holding PLC and Mead Corp.    Several analysts and consultants see possible advantages if ATandamp;T data bases were married with those of information providers to give users hybrid data. And Robert Morris, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., notes that ATandamp;T has two big advantages if it decides to pursue the mass market: its expertise in billing and telemarketing.    With a pipeline into 80 million homes and seven million businesses, industry officials hope ATandamp;T will give the industry the boost it needs to take off. Because of the possibilities of joint ventures and solid expansion of the market for information services, companies already in the business haven't opposed ATandamp;T's entry.    &quot;We view this as an opportunity, not as a threat,&quot; says Carl Valenti, president and publisher of the Dow Jones Information Services Group. &quot;We've talked to ATandamp;T, just as we've talked to others,&quot; Mr. Valenti says, adding that Dow Jones is now &quot;looking forward to sitting down and having a serious discussion.&quot;    Compuserve's president and chief executive officer, Charles McCall, echoes the sentiment: &quot;We haven't had any detailed discussions about joint venturing, but we hope there will be something positive for the future.&quot;    Even competitors such as MCI Communications Corp. say they aren't concerned about the prospect of ATandamp;T's entry into electronic publishing. MCI's main entry in the field has been MCI Mail, an electronic-mail offering that also allows users access to Dow Jones News/Retrieval service. In addition, MCI provides the long-distance transmission for Prodigy, the IBM-Sears joint venture to provide information services at a low cost to the mass market.    That mass market for information services has been elusive as companies weigh the best delivery systems and products -- and question the level of demand among residential and small-business users.    But things are popping. Prodigy is rolling out its service around the country, and has signed up 125,000 memberships. At the same time, the regional Bell companies are testing electronic gateways, which they like to compare to shopping malls, offering users access to many information providers. Edward Greenberg, a telecommunications analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., believes well-designed information service products, such as stock quotes and research data, will be essential.    The Bell companies, however, claim they are hamstrung by Judge Harold Greene, the same judge who just allowed ATandamp;T into electronic publishing. Judge Greene, who oversees the consent decree that broke up ATandamp;T 5 1/2 years ago, has maintained the ban on the regional companies providing or manipulating the content of information products.    In fact, Friday's decision touched off a new round of lobbying by the regional Bell companies for legislation that could lift restrictions on their businesses. Among other things, the Bell companies claim that they will have trouble building a critical mass for their gateway services unless they are allowed to offer electronic yellow pages -- essentially a shopping and referral service based on their yellow-pages customers -- and so-called enhanced white pages that allow telephone customers to electronically search for a listing in several ways.    One company, Chicago-based Ameritech, has decided to skip services that require users to use a computer. Instead, it is concentrating on services customers can get over a telephone, such as horoscope information, weather, sports and stock quotes. The company says its research indicates it won't attract enough users to turn a profit without electronic services.    Lobbying against the &quot;free the Bells&quot; legislation is equally intense. Information providers, including newspaper publishers and long-distance companies, worry that the Bell companies would use their monopolies in local services to crush competition.    Against this background, ATandamp;T is preparing to make some big decisions. &quot;There's a lot of interest out there,&quot; the ATandamp;T spokesman says. &quot;But about the only thing I can tell you is that we've been swamped with calls from entrepreneurial types.&quot;    ---@ Leading On-Line Information Companies @ Excluding providers of stock quotes and other trading information @ NUMBER OF SALES @ SUBSCRIBERS AS OF @ AS OF 12/31/88 @ 12/31/88 (In millions) @ LEXIS, NEXIS, MEDIS (MEAD CORP.) 210,000 $307.5 @ Abstracts and full text of @ articles on financial, medical, @ legal, and general-interest topics @ DIALOG INFORMATION SERVICE INC. 310,000 113.0 @ (KNIGHT-RIDDER INC.) @ 340 databases with abstracts and @ full-text articles on technology, @ medicine, business and the sciences @ COMPUSERVE INFORMATION SERVICE CO. 489,000 86.5* @ (Handamp;R BLOCK INC.) @ Text of general and business @ articles, on-line shopping, @ historical stock quotes, dozens of @ user bulletin boards and abstracts @ DOW JONES NEWS/RETRIEVAL SERVICE 310,000 60.0 @ (DOW JONES andamp; CO.) @ Corporate information, business @ articles, historical stock quotes @ *Fiscal year ended 4/30/89 @ Source: Digital Information Group </TEXT></DOC>
