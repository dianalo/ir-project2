Itwas the third attempted infiltration in four days.   Also today, police in Lebanon said Israeli warplanes attackedtargets on the outskirts of the southern city of Sidon in the fifthsuch attack this year. There were no details on casualties.   Soldiers shot and killed a 20-year-old Palestinian in a clash inthe Gaza town of Khan Yunis and wounded eight other Palestinians inclashes in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Arab doctors said.   And Israeli news reports said police had detained six Jewishsettlers suspected of killing a 13-year-old Arab girl during arampage through a West Bank village.   The army said two Palestinians from Gaza died of wounds sufferedin earlier clashes. It was checking the Arab reports of today'scasualties in the occupied territories.   The border incident occurred near the Lebanese village of Hula,about a mile west of the Israeli town of Kiryat Shemona, said amilitary spokesman.   He said troops spotted the three guerrillas, opened fire andkilled them immediately. The spokesman, who cannot be identifiedaccording to army regulations, said the Israelis suffered nocasualties.   Security sources said the area has been the site of increasedtroop activity in recent days, and reporters observed flares there.   On Tuesday, a guerrilla was shot to death in southern Lebanonafter being spotted by Israeli troops and their south Lebanesemilitia allies east of the Lebanese town of Marjayoun.   Troops also killed two guerrillas Sunday after several rocketswere fired into the Israeli border town of Metulla. Two moreguerillas were captured and two escaped, the army said.   Sunday's raid was claimed by George Habash's Popular Front forthe Liberation of Palestine and the late Talaat Yacoub'sDamascus-based Palestine Liberation Front.   Arab doctors did not identify the Palestinian reported shot andkilled today. The other two Palestinians who died of woundssuffered earlier 14 were identified by Arab news reports as AhmedIbrahim Nawas, 18, who was shot Tuesday, and Mohammed Ali AlFarajani, 15, wounded May 14. Both were shot in the head.   The deaths raised to 502 the number of Palestinians killed inthe nearly 18-month uprising against Israeli occupation of the WestBank and Gaza Strip. Twenty-two Israelis have also been killed.      The army, meanwhile, has started using a new bullet againstPalestinian demonstrators in the occupied lands to help reducefatalities caused by plastic bullets, the Israeli daily Maarivreported.   The newspaper said the so-called ``stun'' bullet is designed notto penetrate the body, but it quoted unidentified army commandersas saying the bullet can kill if fired improperly. It said twodeaths have been attributed to the new bullet.   The newspaper did not provide further details. An army spokesmandeclined immediate comment.   According to army figures, 77 Palestinians have been killed byplastic bullets since they were introduced 10 months ago, in somecases because the bullets were fired contrary to regulations.   Also today, Palestinians throughout the occupied lands observeda general strike ordered by Moslem fundamentalists to protest whatthey called Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's ``curse against theprophet Mohammed.''   The strike referred to a newspaper interview in which Shamirwarned Israel must not make territorial concessions to thePalestinians because ``someone might try to cheat us, to lie tous.''   ``Someone might say, `Let's cheat the Israelis just likeMohammed did. (The Palestinians) always bring these examples of howMohammed used all sorts of ruses to overcome his opponents,''Shamir told the Jerusalem Post in an interview published earlierthis month.   Police, meanwhile, detained six Jewish settlers accused ofkilling a Palestinian girl and wounding two others in a rampageMonday in the West Bank village of Kifil Harith.   The suspects were identified as seminarians at Joseph's TombYeshiva in Nablus, 12 miles away.   The Hadashot daily said the six would be brought before a judgeand charged within a few days.</TEXT></DOC>
