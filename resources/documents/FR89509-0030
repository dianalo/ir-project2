That action was prompted by a report of a control columnwhich failed during a preflight check. This condition, if not corrected,could result in failure of the control column and loss of airplane control.Since issuance of that AD, discontinuities have been identified at locationsin the control column area not previously addressed by the existing ADand the applicable service information (DC-9 Alert Service Bulletin A27-228,Revision 1, dated March 5, 1987). One operator reported an inch-long cracklocated one inch above inspection area C (the upper column area of thefirst officer's control column). The control column had accumulated 56,579landings. A second operator reported two control columns with cracks, butlater analysis revealed that the crack indications were due to a shrinkagecavity and micrographic corrosion.The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnel Douglas Alert Service BulletinA27-288, Revision 2, dated January 18, 1989, which describes proceduresfor inspection for fatigue cracks at locations including, and in additionto, those previously addressed in AD 87-13-04. It adds new replacementpart numbers SB 09270288-3 and -4, and also adds Model DC-9-50 series airplanesto the list of affected models, since it has been determined that the controlcolumns as installed in that model may be subject to the same cracking.FAA has also approved McDonnell Douglas DC-9 Service Bulletin 27-288, datedMay 18, 1988, which provides instructions for replacement of both the captain'sand first officer's control columns with new columns having improved fatiguelife.Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthis same type design, an AD is proposed which would supersede AD 87-13-04to require repetitive inspections of additional areas of the control columnsfor cracks, and replacement, as necessary, in accordance with the McDonnellDouglas service bulletins previously described, and to expand the applicabilityto include Model DC-9-50 series airplanes. A new paragraph A.4. is proposedthat would give credit to those airplanes that have been inspected in accordancewith AD 87-13-04. Replacement of both control columns with the new, improvedcolumns would constitute terminating action for the inspection requirementsof the Ad.Additionally, the proposed supersedure removes all references to the useof ``later FAA-approved revisions of the applicable service bulletin,''in order to be consistent with FAA policy in that regard. The FAA has determinedthat this change will not increase the economic burden on any operator,nor will it increase the scope of the AD, since later revisions of theservice bulletin may be approved as an alternate means of compliance withthis AD, as provided by paragraph B.There are approximately 921 Model DC-9 series airplanes in the worldwidefleet. It is estimated that 538 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affectedby this AD, that it would take approximately 2 manhours per airplane toaccomplish the required additional inspections, and that the average laborcost would be $40 per manhour. Based on these figures, the total cost impactof the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $43,040.The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation(1) is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economicimpact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draftevaluation prepared for this action is contained in the regulatory docket.A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend Part 39 of the FederalAviation Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39 [AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
