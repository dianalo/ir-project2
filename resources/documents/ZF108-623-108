 The emergent behavior or form might seem systematic orchaotic.andP;  Some examples are neural nets, cellular automata, fractals,electronic mail networks, market economies, whirlpools, and snowflakes.andO;Years ago, similar systems were often called self-organizing, and they werefound in models of memory, pattern recognition, multilevel stores, andlibraries.andP;  The area languished, however, awaiting the development of theoryand powerful hardware.andP;  Personal workstations played an important role infacilitating experimentation and massmarket personal computers are now up tothe task.andM;The Blind WatchmakerandM;If you are drawn to such topics or would like to learn more, take a look atzoologist Richard Dawkins' book The Blind Watchmaker and its companionsoftware.andP;  The title of the book alludes to a book by William Paley, aneighteenth-century theologian.andP;  Paley sought to prove the existence of God byarguing that complex objects, like wathces or human eyes, must have beenpurposely designed.andP;  Paley felt that the existence of watches impliedwatchmakers and that the existence of people implied a God.andM;Dawkins disagrees, arguing that complex objects will evolve through naturalselection, if three conditions are met.andP;  They are: that we have self-copyingor replicating entities (like crystals, ideas, or dAN molecules), occasionalcopoying errors, and some property of the replicator that influences theprobability of its being replicated.andP;  Given time for millions of replicationgenerations, he feels we will inevitably see gradual, cumulative evolution,leading to complex systems like people and trees.andP;  It took hyracotherium 20million years to evolve from the size of a terrier to that of a modern horse.andM;Perhaps I liked the book because much of it is couched in informationprocessing terms; for example, DNA molecules are compared to high-capacityROM.andP;  His explanation of natural selection also leads down entertaining sideroads such as speculation about the three-dimensional &quot;image&quot; of itsenvironment that a bat constructs from audio input.andP;  How does the bat'ssubjective experience of the three-dimensional world compare to one based onoptical input?andP;  Dawkins also constantly reminds the reader, using memorableexamples, that we do not have the ability to accurately conceive ofgeologically long time spans or extremely improbable events.andP;  Our intuitionabout such matters is poor because they are beyond teh scope of ourrelatively short lives.andP;  No one remembers the Ice Age and few of us have wonthe Irish Sweepstakes.andM;If you would like to learn more about natural selection while taking someinteresting side trips, you will like this book, but there is more.andP;  Dawkinshas also written a program to go with it.andP;  The program illustrates the effectof cumulative small changes over time on artificial 18-gene &quot;biomorphs.&quot;andM;Figure 1 shows a screen with a biomorph in the center, surrounded by 14potential progeny.andP;  The potential progeny, however, are not exactly like theparent.andP;  They are mutants, with a different value for one of their simulatedgenes.andP;  The genes are values in an array, called the chromosome.andP;  Thebiomorphs are drawings produced by a procedure, which uses the current valueof the chromosome array as input.andP;  For example, gene 9 determines the numberof branchings in the figure, while genes 1-3 determine its horizontal extent.andO;Some of the two-valued genes can be permanently set on or off.andM;Evolution takes place because only one of the 14 possible progeny will becomethe parent of the next generation.andP;  But, which of the progeny will beselected?andP;  The user plays the role of Mother Nature, choosing the luckybiomorph.andP;  The selected biomorph moves to the center of the screen; 14 of itspossible offspring are displayed; and you choose again.andM;The user guides biomorph evolution.andP;  If you decided to try to evolve a smallbiomorph, you would glance at each new generation and select the one thatseemed smallest.andP;  After a few generations, you might only have a simple stickwith a few branches.andP;  Similarly, you can go for large biomorphs or roundishbiomorphs.andP;  The most striking feature I noticed was that there would berelatively little change for several generations, followed by a sudden jump,as shown in Figure 2.andP;  Biomorph evolution is definitely non-linear.andP;  A slightchange in a gene can produce marked change in the biomorph that developsunder its control.andM;In addition to breeding biomorphs, the program lets you engineer them, savethem in albums, and record lineage.andP;  The publisher even runs contests forexpert biomorph breeders.andP;  The program runs on the Macintosh.andM;Desktop FractalsandM;How long is the California coastline?andP;  If you measured it from a satellitephoto, you might get an answer like 1,000 miles.andP;  An ant that decides to walkfrom San Diego to San Francisco, however, faithfully negotiating every nookand cranny of the coastline, will cover a longer distance, and a bacteriumwill have a major hike.andP;  From the point of view of the latter, the Californiaborder seems to be an infinitely long line containing a finite area.andP;  It is aparadox.andP;  Furthermore, there is some similarity in the view of the wanderingcoastline from the satellite or ant or bacterium perspective.andP;  Bycapitalizing on this self-similarity at different levels, simple programs cangenerate complex images.andM;For example, the fern in Figure 3a was generated by the short program listedin Figure 3b.andP;  The drawing is produced by a four-line loop, which is drivenby the 48 integers in array a.andP;  The loop generates a different drawing if oneor more of the 48 input coefficients are changed.andM;The fern program was written by Michael B. Barnsley, and his fern image wason the cover of the June, 1989 issue of National Geographic.andP;  The program isbased on Barnsley's theory of iterated function systems (IFS), and the48-integers are an example of an IFS code.andM;You can learn more about IFS codes and the pictures they generate byreferring to Barnsley's Desktop Fractal Design System, a program forPC-compatible computers, published by Academic Press.andP;  The program comes witha library of IFS codes for assorted drawings, and the user can alter these bychanging the codes or experiment with his or her own codes.andM;The current program is limited to two-dimensional drawings, but Barnsley isworking on a Macintosh version that cna concatenate images to make morecomplex drawings.andP;  If he can come up with a good user interface, a 3-Dprogram might even be forthcoming.andP;  If you decide to really get into it, youcan work your way through Barnsley's upper-division math text FractalsEverywhere.andM;Barnsley is also pursuing practical application of IFS for imagecompressioin.andP;  The IFS code for producing an image is a much more conciserepresentation of that image than its full bitmap, but, given an arbitraryimage, can you automatically derive the IFS code from which it can beaccurately reproduced?andP;  Barnsley feels he can and has formed a company calledIterated Systems Inc. to develop commercial products.andP;  They are marketinghardware and software solutions that run on PC-compatible computers and SunWorkstations.andM;From the demonstrations I have seen, it seems as though this technique issuited to this application niche where extremely high compression isnecessary, and a degree of inaccurate reproductioni is tolerable.andP;  It is anasymmetric technique, taking longer to compress an image than to regenerateit.andP;  An attractive feature of Barnsley's approach is that the user can tunethe system, making trade-offs between fidelity, compressed file size, andcompression and expansion times.andM;Golden OldiesandM;Among the first people to get caught up in the idea of complex systems andbehavior emerging from simple repetition were the MIT hackers running MartinGardner's &quot;Life&quot; program on a very expensive personal computer, the TX-2, atMIT in the 1950s.andP;  The rules of &quot;Life&quot; are simple.andP;  The screen is arectangular grid on which &quot;living&quot; points are represented by an asterisk, and&quot;dead&quot; points are blank; so each point has eight adjacent neighbors.andP;  Youinitialize the program with a configuration of living points, and insuccessive generations a point either lives or dies according to these rules:andM;* A cell with two or three living neighbors surives for another generation;otherwise it dies from overcrowding or loneliness.andM;* A birth occurs in an empty cell with three living neighbors.andM;Early &quot;Life&quot; hackers discovered initial configurations that would give riseto &quot;organisms,&quot; which would glide across the screen, spawn &quot;children&quot; whoglided away, &quot;eat&quot; others, and so on.andP;  They were intrigued by these systems,and if you think you might be, get the &quot;Golden Oldies&quot; game disk fromSoftware Toolworks.andP;  In addition to &quot;Life,&quot; it contains an early adventuregame, the original &quot;Pong,&quot; and Clark Weisenbaum's non-directive theraphy game&quot;Eliza.&quot;andP;  You could also write your own &quot;Life&quot; program rather quickly, and A.andO;K. Dewdney's book the Armchair Universe, contains ideas for several similarsimulations you can program yourself.andM;COMDEX NotesandM;Switching gears--I attended the COMDEX show and jotted a few notes on theback of my program.andP;  Here they are.andM;32-bit Micros: Many manufacturers displayed EISA-bus computers andmotherboards, but none were shipping.andP;  The first EISA computers will beexpensive because of limited supply and the cost of support chips.andP;  In thelong run, business considerations, not technical merit, will determine themarket shares of EISA and IBM's Micro Channel for 32-bit bus machines.andM;DAT: Digital audio tape (DAT) drives were shown by several vendors.andP;  Withgigabyte-plus capacity on a pocket-sized cassette and transfer rates around180 Kbytes/second, DATs seem to have a bright future backing up LAN servers.andO;Their adoption will be slowed by competing format standards, DDS (digitaldata storage), and Data/DAT.andP;  DDSk is a sequential format while Data/DATsupports direct access to files and records.andP;  Both have powerful backers.andO;For an overview of DAT technology and formats, see the special section of theNovember 30, 1989 issue of EDN Magazine.andM;O/S Forecasts: At the last four COMDEX shows, Byte Magazine has askedattendees which operating system they expected to become the dominant forcein the personal computer market by the end of the 1992.andP;  Jeffrey Tartar,editor of the SoftLetter, has been tracking these surveys, and his findingsare reporrted in Table 1.andM;Too bad so much time was wasted on OS/2 for the 80286, and too bad there isnot a unified Unix.andM;Teeny Display: Cyberspace Corporation demonstrated a CGA display, which was alightweight eyepiece attached to a headband.andP;  It was only an inch or so high,but clearly legible.andP;  Such a small, light display could be useful with ageneral purpose portable computer or in a situation (perhaps an assemblyline), where the operator must move around.andM;Servers: Compaq demonstrated their Systempro, an expensive, multiprocessingfile server.andP;  Novell used it at their booth, where they ran benchmarks with250 workstations.andP;  I do not know which was more impressive--the visual impactof a room with 250 computers on a wall running benchmarks or the speed of thesystem, which easily outran a network half the size with a PS/2 server.andO;Zenith and IBM have also announced high performance servers, and there willbe others.andP;  Adios minicomputers.andM;Winnebiko: Steven Roberts displayed his high-tech recumbent bicycle in asponsor's booth at COMDEX as shown in Figure 4.andP;  Roberts is an engineer whohas spent the last six years as a free-lance writer while touring the countryon his solar-powered, computer- and communication-equipped bike.andP;  You canshare his adventures vicariously by subscribing to his newsletter, theJournal of High-tech Nomadness, buying a copy of his book, or correspondingwith him via email.andM;Coalitions: IBM and MicroSoft made a joint announcement endorsing DOS withWindows for systems with 1-2 MB memory and OS/2 for larger machines(realistically, at least 4 MB).andP;  In return for IBM's support of Windows,MicroSoft agreed to deliver OS/2 versions of graphically oriented softwarebefore Windows versions.andP;  They also promised 32-bit OS/2 for 1990.andO;WordPerfect and Lotus agreed to cooperate on user interface innovation anddevelopment.andP;  Look for a common user interfaces and dynamic data exchange inPresentation Manager versions of 123 and WordPerfect.andM;Flash Disk: Several companies demonstrated systems using Intel flash EPROMs.andO;Digipro used them in a solid-state disk emulator, which reads at the speed ofRAM and writes at the speed of a hard disk.andP;  Psion will use them forremovable storage in a line of portables they announced.andP;  According to Intel,the EPROMs can be safely written 100,000 times.andP;  Today they cost more thanRAM, but that might change.andP;  It is too soon to guess whether or not they willbe an effective alternative to rotating storage or the bubble memory of the1990s.andM;Remote Keyboard: The Toteboard, shown in Figure 5, is an infrared-linked PCkeyboard, and was shown by nView.andP;  I had a chance to test a Toteboard andliked it.andP;  For use in stand-up presentations, it balances comfortably on onehand and can be pointed in pretty much any direction.andP;  (I used it in aclassromm.)andP;  It would be terrific for desktop use if the keyboard were alittle larger and of higher quality.andP;  We can all hope they will combine theirtransmitter with a desktop keyboard.andM;286 R.I.P.: There were dozens of 386 and 386SX motherboard vendors at COMDEX,which means cheap clones capable of running DOS with Windows 3.0 and OS/2.andO;Since COMDEX, Intel has announced standard and lower-power (for portables)versions of a 20Mhz 386SX, along with a cache controller, math and Ethernetcoprocessors, and a two-chip AT-interface set.andP;  Intel Vice President MichaelAymar predicts a single-chip Pc motherboard (without memory) by 1993, and Iexpect soon there will also be alternative suppliers for 386 chips.andP;  MichaelSlater, editor of the Microprocessor Report, predicts the 486-based computerswill eventually eliminate high-end (33Mhz) 386s.andM;Scanners: There were many handheld scanner being offered to systemintegrators, so I expect they will become very inexpensive also.andP;  A handheldscanner in conjunction with robust optical character recognition (OCR)software would make a nice scholar's or student's companion.andP;  I can imaginemyself with a portable PC and a scanner at the library, recording excerptsfrom books or periodicals.andP;  The tricky part is OCR software that can readdifferent fonts and typeset material, but the speed of modern personalcomputers may make that commonplace before long.andM;Touch Screens: The touchscreen technology at Elographic's booth was a realeye opener.andP;  The resolution and sensitivity of their hardware is terrific.andO;They also have a wide variety of development software, making ir possible toquickly develop applications with screen constructs that are suited to touchscreen.andP;  For example, they implemented a COMDEX booth-location system, whichwas a snap to use, in just a few hours of Pascal programming useing theirtools.andP;  If you, as I did, formed your impression of touch screen hardware andsoftware in the days of low-resolution arrays of LCDs around the edges ofdisplays, give it a second look.andM;Floppy Replacement: In 1976, magnetic floppy disks replaced paper tape as theremovable storage medium of choice for hobbyist personal computers.andP;  That wasan obvious move, but the next step is not so clear--there are manycontenders.andP;  Insite Peripherals is off to as fast a start as any.andP;  Theydemonstrated their &quot;floptical&quot; disk, on which they record magnetically, butposition the readwrite head optically.andP;  The precise positioning made possibleby the optically recorded information allows them to squeeze 20.9.andP;  MB on astandard sized 3.k inch disk.andP;  Their drives can also read standard magneticmedia, and they should be available this year.andP;  One industry committee hasrecommended the floptical disc as a standard, but the case is far fromclosed.andM;Larry Press welcomes comments from readers.andP;  He can be reached through thefollowing address, phone number or email address: 10726 Esther Avenue LosAngeles, CA 90064 (213) 475-6515 1press@venera.isi.eduandM;POINTERSandM;Dawkins, Richard, The Blind Watchmaker.andP;
