The activities consisted ofexperiments on leaching of uranium from Swedish shales and of work onresidues from the leachings. The work comprised bench-scale experimentsand pilot plants. Some residues were sluiced to the Vinterviken bay throughwaste pipes. Measurements of the sediments show a marked increase ofthe uranium content in the sediment layers formed during the nineteenfifties. However, the percentages are too low to be of any health hazard.The measurements also reveal the results of the atmospheric nuclear weaponstests in the nineteen fifties and sixties as an increase of the cesium137 content.
