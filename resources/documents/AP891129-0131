(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Randy Kraft was sentenced to the gaschamber today for strangling 16 young men during a 12-year spree ofsexual torture and mutilation.   ``Burn in hell, Kraft!'' one of the victims' relatives shoutedas Kraft was led from court. ``Turn around and look!'' the relativeshouted.   The 44-year-old Long Beach computer consultant was convicted ofmurder in May after a 10{-month trial. In August the juryrecommended the death penalty, and Superior Court Judge Donald A.McCartin today agreed.   The judge recounted one of Kraft's slayings, which includedcigarette lighter torture, castration and mutilation, and said, `Ifanyone ever deserved the death penalty, he's got it coming.''   Kraft was convicted of murders that occurred between 1972 and1983. Prosecutors said he picked up hitchhikers, gave them drugsand alcohol, sexually tortured or mutilated them and then strangledthem.   The bodies were dumped along roads, frequently from a moving car.   Highway Patrol officers arrested Kraft in 1983 after pulling himover for erratic driving and discovering a strangled Marine in hiscar.   The courtroom was full of victims' relatives, who cried andhugged when it became apparent the death penalty would be imposed.Kraft remained calm throughout the proceeding, playing with a pencap, yawning, laughing and chatting with his attorney.   Kraft after sentencing addressed the judge, saying only, ``Ihave not murdered anyone and I believe a reasonable review of therecord will show that.''</TEXT></DOC>
