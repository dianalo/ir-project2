The report will provide the first clear reading of how theeconomy fared last month. The jobs report often has thegreatest market impact of any of the U.S. government'smonthly economic data.</LP><TEXT>   Stock prices were mixed for most of yesterday, with marketaverages holding gains until late in the session, when a waveof computer-guided sell programs sent prices down.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended with a loss of 5.82at 3012.52. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index slipped 0.94 to388.26, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 0.41to 213.60, and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index dropped 0.98to 363.65.   Big Board advancers trailed decliners nearly all day. Bythe close, 783 stocks had risen in price, while 838 hadfallen. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled166,290,000 shares, compared with 163,520,000 shares Tuesday.   September's employment report comes as the market appearspoised for a sharp move one way or the other, market watcherssay. Stocks have been stalled near current levels for months.Though a few analysts say stocks could go higher, manyinvestors worry that October will bring a sudden sell-offreminiscent of some of the market's previous autumndisasters.   &quot;This is probably the highest-risk period of the year,&quot;said Stefan D. Abrams, chief investment strategist at KidderPeabody. He noted that most money managers haven't made muchmoney in the past six months, with the market in a relativelynarrow trading range. But he suggested that money managersare likely to err on the side of caution and sell stocks tolock in profits if the market doesn't appear ready to rally.   Bonds have risen sharply in recent weeks. But apprehensionover the employment report also sent the bond market sinkingyesterday.   If the report shows signs of economic strength, it couldcause the Federal Reserve to delay lowering interest ratesfurther. That would also be bad news for stocks, analystssay. While evidence of economic recovery would ultimately begood for stocks, any interruption in the steady lowering ofinterest rates could cause stocks to falter.   Mr. Abrams noted that a poor employment report would alsoworry equity investors. While signs of economic weaknessmight lead to lower rates, he said, investors could panic ifit looks as if the rate cuts made so far aren't having thedesired effect on the economy.   Alan Ackerman, executive vice president at Reich andamp; Co.,said most of the buying in the market is being done with cashraised by taking profits in other stocks. He advisedinvestors with cash to hold off putting it all in the market.   &quot;Now is not the time to be fully invested,&quot; he said. &quot;Anydisappointment will cause the market to react downward.&quot;   Alfred E. Goldman, director of technical research at A.G.Edwards andamp; Sons, agreed that aggressive accounts should havean above-average cash reserve right now. But Mr. Goldman saidhe doubts that in a sell-off the market averages would gobelow support levels set earlier this year.   &quot;At 2850 {on the Dow Jones industrials}, I would be abuyer again,&quot; he said.   Chrysler, which gained 1/8 to 10 1/4, was the most activeissue on the Big Board as volume surged to 11.3 millionshares. The auto maker sold 35 million new shares at 10 1/8in an underwriting led by Salomon Brothers on Tuesday.Yesterday's hefty volume represented selling by somespeculative accounts that were flipping the stock for aprofit. Salomon officials said buyers yesterday included manyinstitutional investors that weren't able to completely filltheir orders in Tuesday's underwriting.   Time Warner jumped 2 1/8 to 85. Two Japanese companies, C.Itoh and Toshiba, confirmed that they are in negotiations tobuy an interest in the entertainment giant. But neither ofthe Japanese companies would comment on how large aninvestment they may make. Japan's leading economic newspaper,Nihon Keizai Shimbun, said each of the companies would invest$500 million in the deal that would give them a total ofslightly more than 12% of Time Warner's stock.   Time Warner wouldn't comment on the reports, but thecompany said as recently as last week that it was in talkswith unnamed parties and expects to announce a &quot;strategicalliance partnership&quot; before year's end.   Student Loan Marketing Association, or Sallie Mae, lost5/8 to 59. The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Streetcolumn yesterday said the student loan packager's growthprospects may be limited.   American Express lost 3/4 to 25 3/8, with all of that lossa result of selling on the Pacific Stock Exchange after theBig Board closed. Shortly after 4 p.m. EDT, the companyannounced that it would take a $265 million charge in thethird quarter. The company said its travel unit will probablyreport a third-quarter loss of $50 million to $75 million.   Freeport-McMoRan Oil andamp; Gas Royalty Trust said it will add$1.90 per unit to its October payout because of theresolution of a tax issue. The October distribution, whichwill also include the trust's portion of September netproceeds, will be announced in mid-October and paid inJanuary. The trust's units jumped 1 1/2 to 6 3/8 in heavytrading.   Tyco Labs lost 4 3/8 to 34 3/4. Merrill Lynch cut itsrating on the stock and lowered its 1992 earnings estimatefor the company, citing competition in the fire sprinklermarket.   Chiquita Brands International slid 1 1/2 to 47 on concernsabout falling banana prices. Prudential Securities said thecompany's third-quarter results, seasonally soft even in goodyears, may be particularly weak this year because of pricepressures.   Kellogg jumped 2 5/8 to 111 5/8, the latest food companyto be the subject of vague takeover talk. Speculation thatthe company could be a target circulated among riskarbitrageurs. But Robert Chapman, vice president of arbitrageand strategic hedging at County NatWest, dismissed therumors. Mr. Chapman said recent selling of the stock by theKellogg Foundation, which controls about 35% of Kellogg'sshares, argues against any deal. Chapman estimates that thetop price Kellogg could bring probably wouldn't exceed $125 ashare -- too small a premium over the stock's current priceto warrant speculation.   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.61to 375.56. Volume on that exchange totaled 13,057,000 shares,compared with 13,394,000 Tuesday. There were 283 issues thatrose and 267 that fell.</TEXT></DOC>
