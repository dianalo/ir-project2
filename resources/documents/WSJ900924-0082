The agreement, reached after a marathon bargaining sessionFriday, met the Canadian Auto Workers' major demands. The12,800 Ford Motor Co. of Canada workers were expected toreturn to work this morning, ending the week-long strike.</LP><TEXT>   The agreement includes percentage wage increases in eachyear of the three-year contract, improved cost-of-livingprotection, added time off and a broad income-securityprogram.   Wages will increase by 7.5% in the first year, 6.7% in thesecond year and 4.8% in the third. The increases includeestimated cost-of-living allowances of 4.5%, 4.7% and 2.8%,respectively, designed to provide 90% protection againstinflation.   Ford Canada also has established a 100 million Canadiandollar (US$86.6 million) fund to finance the generous earlyretirement, severance pay and income supplement programsagreed to in the contract.   Union President Robert White called the agreement &quot;thebest worker income-security program&quot; in the industry and saidhe expects it to become a model for labor negotiations inother industries.   The agreement will be the basis for negotiations with theCanadian unit of General Motors Corp. and Chrysler CanadaLtd. The auto workers' contracts with the Canadian units ofthe Big Three auto makers expired Sept. 14. Ford Canada wasthe Canadian Auto Worker's target in the pattern-settingnegotiations.   Mr. White said GM Canada probably will be the next companythe union negotiates with. Nick Hall, a GM Canada spokesman,said the Ford contract looks expensive, but he declined toelaborate.   Chrysler Canada officials declined to comment on the FordCanada contract, but analysts said the cash-strapped companywould have difficulty affording such a settlement.   Chrysler is financially &quot;very weak and there are questionsof whether it could even withstand a strike,&quot; Toronto autoanalyst Dennis DesRosiers said earlier in the Fordnegotiations.   In separate U.S. auto talks, Chrysler already has warnedthat it may not be able to match the settlement the UnitedAuto Workers reached last week with General Motors.   Ford Canada's chief negotiator, Donald McKenzie, declinedto say how much the agreement will cost the company, butcalled it &quot;a handsome settlement&quot; as far as workers areconcerned.   The contract requires that Ford provide one-year's noticein the event of a plant closing and six months' notice of joblosses due to technological change or outsourcing -- thebuying of products from outside sources, rather thanproducing them inhouse.   When jobs are lost for these reasons, the contractprovides for early retirement at full pension for olderworkers with at least 10 years of service. Depending onlength of service, laid-off workers also may receive 95% oftheir income for up to three years, or choose severancepayments of up to C$65,000.   The union said the compensation plan is designed toencourage older workers to leave the work force ahead ofyounger ones.   Also in the new settlement is an annual C$500 vacationbonus for workers, and workers will also get three additionalfour-day weekends a year. Mr. White said the extra time off,a key issue in the talks, is likely to have an influence onthe auto talks in the U.S.   Ford Canada also agreed to create a &quot;social justice fund&quot;to make contributions to such things as internationaldevelopment and relief projects and food banks. The companywill contribute one cent per hour worked to the fund, up toC$250,000. It will also contribute to the Canadian AutoWorkers' child care program.</TEXT></DOC>
