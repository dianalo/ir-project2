It was the second boost in the key lending rate this year andreflected the banks' own costs of borrowing money, which has beenrising steadily over the past few months.   The prime is watched closely because bankers use it as a basisfor calculating loans to businesses and for determining many typesof fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans, including popularhome-equity loans.   Chase Manhattan Bank in New York was the first to announce therate increase and was quickly followed by other big banks,including Citibank, First National Bank of Chicago, Bank of NewYork and Manufacturers Hanover.   The last increase in the prime was on May 11, from 8.5 percentto 9 percent. The increase today put the prime at the highest pointsince March 1986.   Reaction in the financial markets was muted, partly because arise had been widely expected. On Wall Street, the Dow Jonesaverage of 30 industrials was off less than a point to the 2,104level by late morning.   In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of the economy andinterest rate trends, the Treasury's key 30-year bond, was downslightly in price, raising its yield to 9.18 percent from 9.17percent late Wednesday.   The prime rate rise came one day after Federal Reserve ChairmanAlan Greenspan warned he would move to tighten credit if inflationstarted to accelerate.   Testifying in Congress, Greenspan said the Fed ``at thisjuncture might be well advised to err more on the side ofrestrictiveness rather than stimulus.''   There has been growing evidence that inflation could risesignificantly this year. Low unemployment, strains on America'sproductive capacities and rising commodity prices caused by thedrought point to higher consumer prices in the months ahead.   Many economists have predicted that interest rates would riseslightly this year but do not believe the increase will be dramatic.</TEXT></DOC>
