Hoffmann-La Roche andamp; Co. AG has turned over information sought by the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with an investigation into possible insider trading in Roche's bid for Sterling Drug Inc., a Roche official said.    &quot;We are working together with them (the SEC),&quot; said the official, who asked to remain unidentified. &quot;We gave them all the information they wanted because we have nothing to hide.    &quot;None of our employees was involved. It is pretty clear there is nothing to be found,&quot; he said. The official declined to disclose the nature of the information the Swiss drug company gave to the U.S. agency.    &quot;It was a misunderstanding that arose when we bought shares before the announcement&quot; of Roche's $4.2 billion takeover bid for Sterling Jan. 4, the official said. &quot;That isn't illegal. The SEC is looking for leaks, not from our company, but from individuals&quot; prior to the announcement of the Roche bid, the official said. He wasn't more specific.    The SEC investigation came to light before Eastman Kodak Co. acquired Sterling Jan. 15 in a $5.1 billion takeover.    Separately, the Swiss Bankers Association said its collection of information from several banks in connection with the case is continuing. Under an agreement with the U.S., the association acts as a conduit for U.S. requests for information from Swiss banks. </TEXT></DOC>
