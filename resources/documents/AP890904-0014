But cracks showed in the 14-party National Opposition Unioncoalition just minutes after Violeta Barrios de Chamorro andVirgilio Godoy were chosen as its presidential and vice presidentialcandidates late Saturday.   The Chamorro-Godoy ticket was approved with the minimum 10 votesout of a possible 14 after five rounds of voting Saturday. Theballoting followed another five rounds on Thursday.   Three parties pushing businessman Enrique Bolanos for the vicepresidential slot abstained in the final vote, and one party'sballot was annulled.   All 14 parties signed a document committing themselves to supportthe winning ticket.   But the representative of the National Conservative Party, one ofthe three abstaining, was heard to say shortly after the meetingended that his group might split from the coalition.   If one party drifts away from the Opposition Union and othersfollow, the opposition's dream of defeating the Sandinistas likelywill collapse.   Parties within the coalition reportedly have acknowledged thatonly by uniting might they defeat the Sandinista National LiberationFront.   But merging the 14 parties of the traditionally fractiousNicaraguan opposition into a common front is already a substantialachievement. The parties range from communists to conservatives.   Of the 21 parties legally registered for the Feb. 25 balloting,three others have nominated their own candidates. But they are notconsidered a major factor.   The real squaring off will be between the Opposition Union andthe Sandinista Front.   The Sandinistas' biggest advantage is that they are in power, ina country where the line separating the government party and thestate apparatus is blurred at best.   Government vehicles are used to transport people to Sandinistarallies, and public employees are expected to show up at``spontaneous'' protests and ``consciousness-raising meetings'' orrisk losing their jobs.   In addition to using government resources for party purposes, theSandinistas are superbly organized and disciplined at every level ofthe national structure.   Bickering and infighting, on the other hand, have characterizedthe Nicaraguan opposition. Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the onlyprominent Nicaraguan figure whose following crosses party and sociallines, often calls on politicians to ``leave behind personalinterest and look out for the good of the whole nation.''   The coalition still must decide how candidacies for provincialand local posts will be distributed, something that is likely tobring into play the parties' regional power.   They also must agree on how they will run for the 96 seats in theunicameral national legislature.   Mrs. Chamorro was an ideal choice for the Opposition Unionpresidential candidate. She is a unifying symbol for thewide-ranging coalition.   The Jan. 10, 1978 assassination of her husband, Pedro JoaquinChamorro, a newspaper publisher and foe of late President AnastasioSomoza, helped draw the country together in support of theSandinista revolution.   Mrs. Chamorro is seen as a strong supporter of democracy and iswidely recognized at home and abroad.   She publishes the family newspaper, La Prensa, which now is astrong critic of the Sandinistas, who ousted Somoza in July 1979.   Mrs. Chamorro is not known to belong to a party and is weak onpolitical experience and administrative expertise. Her upper-classbackground had to be balanced with a running mate more appealing tothe center and left.   Bolanos would have made the ticket too right-wing to attractwidespread support.   That's where Godoy came in. Godoy is a deft center-leftpolitician with long experience in Nicaraguan politics and publicadministration.   For the past 10 years he has been president of the centristIndependent Liberal Party. He was a professor and dean of theSociology Department at the Nicaraguan National AutonomousUniversity for 14 years.   The criticism against the 55-year-old lawyer stems from histenure as labor minister under the Sandinistas from July 19, 1979,until March 31, 1984, and from what some have called an abrasive andarrogant personality.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Doralisa Pilarte has covered Nicaragua for TheAssociated Press since January.
