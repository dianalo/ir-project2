Baker III failedFriday to heal a rift with West Germany over nuclear missiles,leaving a shadow over the May 29-30 summit President Bush willattend with other Western leaders.   ``If we had bridged the gap I would tell you,'' Baker said afterhe met with West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. Hesaid the security of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization couldbe at risk if the allies let their nuclear defenses down.   Meanwhile, officials of the 15 other NATO nations welcomed inguarded terms Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposal tounilaterally cut 500 short-range nuclear weapons. Baker said it wasmerely a Soviet public relations ploy and Bush's national securityadviser said it was designed to split NATO.   Brent Scowcroft, speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One asBush flew to Texas for a speech, said the Soviet proposal ``isdesigned principally to create problems within the alliance ...divisions within the Western alliance.''   The NATO officials, in a statement after Baker briefed them onhis trip earlier this week to Moscow, said, ``We consider reductionin 500 weapons alone as a welcome, positive, but rather modeststep,'' The statement said NATO looks to Moscow for further``reductions in its unwarranted superiority.''   The Bush administration's dispute with West Germany is overshort-range nuclear missiles targeted against the Soviet-led WarsawPact countries, mostly from sites on West German soil. West Germanywants to delay a proposal to triple the range of the missiles andto increase their speed, asking instead that the United Statesbegin to negotiate short-range missile cutbacks on both sides withthe Soviet Union.   The dispute has opened fissures within the alliance. A majoritysupports West Germany in a position that Baker suggested waspartially motivated by politics.   Disarmament feeling is strong in West Germany, and ChancellorHelmut Kohl's decision to oppose modernizing the Lance missiles andto urge negotiations is viewed as a way of trying to improve hischances for re-election next year.   Gorbachev complicated Baker's task with an announcement Thursdaythat the Soviets would withdraw 500 nuclear missiles, bombs andartillery shells from Eastern Europe this year.   He alo advised Baker in a 3{-hour Kremlin meeting that theWarsaw Pact would propose at East-West talks in Vienna wide-rangingcutbacks in troops, tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear forces.   Baker said the unilateral withdrawal of about 5 percent of theSoviet short-range nuclear arsenal was ``quite apparently designedfor public opinion'' and included no guarantee the missiles wouldbe destroyed.   He said the pullout would have only a modest impact on theEast's edge in nuclear weapons in Europe and that he did not intendto ``play a public relations game'' with Gorbachev.   The allies should approach arms reduction moves ``with prudenceand realism,'' Baker said.   He said that while U.S. differences with West Germany posedpolitical problems, ``what would be a worse disaster is if we letdomestic politics endanger the security of the alliance.''   After their discussion, Genscher said that while the Lancemodernization issue was no closer to agreement, ``it was not theaim of this meeting to make progress.''   Baker said that after a ``full exchange'' on the issue, he hopedGenscher ``better understands our position.'' He said he was stillhopeful for a settlement before the NATO meeting in two weeks.   He also met Friday with Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van denBroek, whose country is one of several NATO members trying tomediate in the modernization debate.   The Dutch official said he had ``good hope'' the issue will beresolved and didn't think Gorbachev's proposal ``will have a directinfluence.''   NATO estimates the Soviet Union has 1,450 short-range nuclearmissile launchers in Europe, against 88 for the Western alliance.That imbalance _ as well as a Warsaw Pact superiority inconventional weapons _ is a main reason the United States andBritain reject talks on battlefield nuclear arms.   West Germany and other allies want to put off modernization ofthe Lance missiles until the early 1990s and to begin reductiontalks on the battlefied weapons quickly. They argue the East-Westclimate has improved enough in recent years to bring such talks toa positive conclusion.   Though officials of the NATO countries don't want the dispute tomar the summit, ostensibly designed to celebrate NATO's 40thbirthday, Baker gave no indication the United States would give injust to clear the air.   ``It is a very, very important issue, involving as it doesquestions of alliance security,'' he said.   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, in Perth, Scotland,for a Conservative Party conference, supported the U.S. position.   He said the 500 warheads represent only ``a small proportion''of the Soviets' stockpile and Gorbachev's action did not underminethe case for modernizing NATO's short-range missile system.   Howe was asked if he thought Gorbachev was trying to split NATOand he replied, ``I think it's characteristic of Mr. Gorbachev's... position that he always tries to remove one of his many veilsof armor before a NATO meeting.''   But he added, ``I think there is serious arms control businessto be done and we welcome his response to our longstandingpositions.''</TEXT></DOC>
