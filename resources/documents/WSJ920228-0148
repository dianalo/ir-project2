Widespread Israeli anger over what some see as Baker'sattempt to damage Shamir may rally support for the hard-lineprime minister. His election opponent, Rabin, already isnervous about being seen as the U.S. favorite. Israelihard-liners urge Shamir to drop the guarantee request. TheU.S., though, wants to keep the issue alive.</LP><TEXT>   Baker privately tells a Palestinian leader that theloan-guarantee negotiations are the only U.S. leverage overIsrael's settlements policies. In addition, withdrawal ofIsrael's request would jeopardize passage of Bush's entireforeign aid bill.   Some officials also worry that the Arabs have littleincentive to negotiate if they believe Baker will extractconcessions from Shamir.                                                                                                          JITTERY DEMOCRATS in Congress hold back from presidentialbandwagons.   With lawmakers set to select 218 of their number nextmonth to be convention delegates, &quot;there is massivenervousness&quot; about Clinton, says uncommitted Rep. Gejdenson.Rep. Murtha, a Vietnam Marine veteran, expresses anger withClinton's explanation of his draft status. Congressionalleaders urge members to remain uncommitted for as long aspossible, to maximize their importance at the convention.   Barring the clear-cut emergence of a nominee, more thanhalf of the congressional delegates are likely to go into theconvention uncommitted. And Rep. Hoyer says even those whohave already endorsed a candidate &quot;are still a prettyflexible group.&quot; With the concerns about Clinton and doubtsabout Tsongas's national appeal, Rep. Penny sees an openingfor Kerrey to attract more support, but is frustrated that hehasn't been able to get the candidate to schedule a speech tomembers.                                                                                                          BUCHANAN FORCES see targets of opportunity to further bashBush.   They figure that a good showing, more than 30%, in GeorgiaTuesday will give them several chances to surprise thepresident on Super Tuesday -- such as Louisiana, where theycount on beating David Duke, and Oklahoma. That could set upa March 17 showdown with Bush in Michigan, which strategiststhink could do for Buchanan what Reagan's upset victory inNorth Carolina did for his flagging campaign in 1976.   Buchanan has raised more than $600,000 since the NewHampshire primary, mostly in small contributions.Croatian-Americans are particularly enthusiastic, pumping inmore than $100,000 so far. Meanwhile, though, Bush has raisedover $13 million, and aides expect him to hit the federalfundraising ceiling by June 1, earlier than Reagan in 1984.   Bush focus groups test ways to exploit the gender gap thatsurfaced in New Hampshire, pointing out inflammatory commentsBuchanan has made about women.                                                                                                          SHORING UP Bush support on the right, the administrationis sending Attorney General Barr to testify against a billthat would write the Roe vs. Wade abortion ruling into law.The Justice Department has previously declined to give theissue such visibility with testimony from Cabinet-levelofficials.                                                                                                          DEMOCRATS SET to approve Ohio Rep. Oakar tomorrow -- asplatform committee cochair may run into objections from keyparty constituencies. Among other things, she has opposedsome federal funding of abortion and is mistrusted by thepro-Israel lobby -- and in addition, has been the subject ofpayroll-padding allegations.                                                                                                          SEEKING TO BLUNT Bush's charges that Congress acts like aprivileged class, House Democrats seek to embarrass him bytargeting White House perks. One likely focus: the fivefull-time florists.                                                                                                          A BRANCH-BANKING BILL could emerge despite bankers'qualms. The Senate Banking Committee may add a provision tothe Sandamp;L cleanup bill, while a House banking panel negotiateswith Treasury. Many bankers, though, fear a bill would againlimit them from insurance and securities activities. &quot;Whatprogress our factionalized industry can make in an electionyear remains to be seen,&quot; says NationsBank Chairman HughMcColl, a branching advocate.                                                                                                          THE DOLLAR RESISTS U.S. and Japanese attempts to hold itdown.   After a long hiatus, the U.S. has intervened in currencymarkets at least three times in the past six weeks to try tonudge the dollar down against the yen. But the market shrugsoff the attempts, partly because traders are convinced theU.S. economy is picking up steam. The recent surge inlong-term interest rates is also a factor.   A sharply stronger dollar would hurt U.S. exports, animportant force in the economy right now, and widen thepolitically explosive trade deficit with Japan. &quot;Everybodywould just as soon have the yen stronger,&quot; a U.S. officialsays. &quot;The question is whether you can do anything about it.&quot;   Treasury, which directs intervention, thinks it can dosome good, but some Fed officials have reservations.
