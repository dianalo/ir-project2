General information aboutthe mechanism of water radiolysis are presented. Features of radiolytictransformations of water and aqueous solutions at high (up to 500 degC) temperatures: temperature dependence of primary yields of radiolyticproducts, kinetics of short-lived particle reactions; high-temperatureradiolysis of water under the reaction of different types of ionizingradiation as well as radiolysis of water vapor are considered in detail.136 refs.; 35 figs.; 36 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
