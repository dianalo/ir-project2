L. 99-570, (the Act) was signed into law by the President.As a first step in implementing the requirements of the Act, a final ruleand request for comments on ``Commercial Driver Licensing Standards; Requirementsand Penalties'' was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 1, 1987, implementing certain provisionsof the Act required to be effective on July 1, 1987.The FHWA received a total of 260 comments in response to the June 1, 1987request for comments (Docket MC-125, Notice Number 87-06), which included:<ITAG tagnum="25">171 from farmers and relatives of farmers;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">21 from agricultural firms and farmer organizations;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">18 from State agencies;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">11 from private industry and trade associations (4 of which representedmotor carriers of either property or passengers);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">6 from individual truck drivers;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">4 from public interest groups;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">4 from motor carriers of property;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">4 from Federal agencies and/or their advisory committees;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">3 from labor unions;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">2 from owner-operator driver associations;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">2 from truck renting and leasing companies;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">2 from safety/regulatory compliance consultants;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">2 from the insurance industry;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">1 from a foreign government;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">1 from a church organization;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">1 from an individual bus driver;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">1 from a member of the U.S. House of Representatives; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">1 from a city transit agency.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">It should be noted that there were five organizations who submittedmultiple responses. Each of these five organizations had more than onerepresentative or official submit their own individual comments; hencethe above listing totals only 255 rather than 260. Also, a major portionof the commenters requested exemptions from the Commercial Driver's License(CDL) requirements instead of addressing the questions which were posed.Although the final rule requested comments on a number of issues, thisnotice would amend 49 CFR Parts 383, Commercial Driver Licensing Standards;Requirements and Penalties, and 391, Qualifications of Drivers, to clarifythe definitions of excessive speeding, reckless driving and other serioustraffic violations found in andSection; 383.5, Definitions. It would amendandSection; 383.31 to clarify certain notification requirements, especiallyhow such requirements would apply to casual, intermittent, or occasionaldrivers. Section 383.51, Disqualification of Drivers, would be modifiedto allow reduction of lifetime disqualification under certain circumstances.Finally, a conforming amendment is proposed for andSection; 391.15, Disqualificationof Drivers. No changes are proposed for those sections of 49 CFR Part 383that define the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) at which a vehicle wouldbe a CMV, that require notification of previous employment, that statethe applicability of Part 383 as it relates to drivers of vehicles whichcarry hazardous materials, or that address drivers who are domiciled inforeign countries.Each of these proposals is discussed in the following sections along withthe nature of the responses to the various questions that were asked inthe docket and the FHWA's proposed rulemaking action for each of the issues.Some of the regulatory changes included in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(NPRM) were addressed in a separate final rulemaking, Blood Alcohol ConcentrationLevel for Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers, published on October 4, 1988(53 FR 39044). The proposed changes of this NPRM follow the changes madein that final rule. Both changes are included in the appropriate placesin the proposed regulatory text, in order to make it easier to follow thechanges proposed in this notice as well as the regulatory changes of theBlood Alcohol Concentration final rule.Discussion of responses to the questions<ITAG tagnum="81">Background</ITAG><T3>Question Area 1. </T3>Drivers Domiciled in Contiguous Foreign Countries:The FHWA is reviewing the licensing standards of foreign jurisdictionsto determine if they are consistent with United States' standards. If theirstandards are not consistent, section 12009(a)(12) of the Act would allowStates to issue commercial drivers' licenses to foreign motor vehicle driverswho are not domiciled in a State. Canadian licensing standards were determinedto be consistent with United States standards so that a Canadian classifiedlicense will be accepted. Effective July 1, 1987, and until the FHWA reviewis completed, a Mexican commercial driver's license is accepted as a singlecommercial vehicle driver's license within the meaning of the Act.To assist in the review of the ways in which foreign jurisdictions testand license CMV drivers and the methods by which the FHWA can include foreignCMV drivers in the CDL program, the FHWA requested comments to the followingquestions:<T3>Question 1(a). </T3>How do Canadian and Mexican licensing standardscompare to United States' standards?The overwhelming majority of the docket respondents did not comment onthis question; those who did were unable to furnish any detailed comparisons.The commenters suggested that the FHWA make a detailed study of Canadianand Mexican CMV driver testing and licensing standards.<T3>Question 1(b). </T3>What process should be used for a State to issuea commercial driver's license to foreign drivers?Again, very few respondents addressed this question; and those that did,were mainly concerned about issues of reciprocity both in the areas oflicense acceptance and reporting of violations committed while in the hostcountry. It was generally stated that if the FHWA determined that foreignlicensing practices were at least equal to those envisioned by the Act,then the FHWA should accept those licenses as adequate for operating CMVsin this country; but, with the proviso that such foreign drivers be issuedsome form of a ``certificate'' by a port-of-entry State's licensing agency.This certificate would provide the means by which to establish a uniqueidentifier for each such driver to be entered into the Commercial DriverLicense Information System (CDLIS), thus providing a means for trackingall traffic violation convictions of these foreign drivers.If the foreign licensing jurisdiction's regulations were not up to thestandards that will eventually be promulgated under the Act, the commentersstated that those drivers should be tested and licensed (if qualified)by a port-of-entry State that is a participant in the CDL system, withthat driver's data entered into the CDLIS.<T3>Question 1(c). </T3>If foreign drivers retain their foreign licenses,how should they be included in the information systems to enforce the singlerecord concept?The few comments received in response to this question, for the most part,suggested two possible methods. Some respondents suggested that the foreigndrivers be tested and issued a CDL by a port-of-entry State and the driver'sdata entered into the CDLIS by that State. Other respondents suggestedthat if the foreign country's standards were found to be equivalent ofthose of the CDL system in the United States, then a unique identifiershould be established for the driver, which would also identify him/heras a ``foreign driver'' and a CDL certificate would then be issued to thedriver. This certificate would enable the issuing State to enter each suchdriver into the Commercial Driver License Information System (CDLIS), thusproviding a means for tracking all of their traffic violation convictions.Another concern was the related issue of full reporting of all foreignconvictions of U.S. drivers to the CDLIS.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rulemaking Action</ITAG>The related Final Commercial Driver Testing and Licensing Standards issuedon July 15, 1988 (53 FR 27628), included a method by which foreign driverscould be licensed according to Federal standards. In the docket relatedto that final rule (Docket No. 87-18), the FHWA received comments whichindicated that issuance of a ``nonresident license'' to drivers from foreignjurisdictions which do not test and license consistent with the Federalstandard would resolve this issue. The FHWA incorporated this suggestionwhich is more fully explained in the Preamble to that final rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">Background </ITAG><T3>Question Area 2. </T3>Vehicles with a GVWR under 26,001 pounds:``Commercial motor vehicle'' is defined in andSection; 383.5 as a vehiclewith a gross vehicle weight rating of 26,001 or more pounds, or one designedto transport more than 15 passengers (including the driver), or any vehiclewhich is transporting hazardous materials in an amount that requires itto be placarded under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act.In the preamble to the final rule published on June 1, 1987 (52 FR 20574),the FHWA estimated that this definition will result in approximately 5.5million drivers being required to be licensed under these requirements.This definition (1) targets regulation of those drivers that pose the greatesthazard to the public, (2) enhances the States' ability to implement andenforce the commercial motor vehicle driver's license program within themandated timeframe, and (3) limits the economic impact and compliance burdenon drivers, motor carriers, and States.The definition of a commercial motor vehicle was specified in the Act asa vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 pounds or more. However, in section 12019(6)(A)of the Act, Congress authorized the Secretary to lower the threshold to10,001 pounds, if safety warrants. The Act further requires that inclusionof any vehicles below the 26,001 pounds threshold be handled by regulation.Therefore, the FHWA requested comments on the following questions pertainingto these issues:<T3>Question 2(a). </T3>Is a GVWR of 26,001 pounds an appropriate thresholdfor applicability of this rule?Approximately one-fifth of the respondents addressed the question directly;the majority of these were against a lowering of the weight threshold.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), 22 percent of the Stateagencies who responded and about half of the comments from truck driversexpressed a desire to lower the threshold to 10,001 pounds, or some intermediatelevel. On the other hand, farmers, farm organizations, some motor carrierindustry associations, and truck renting and leasing companies and theirtrade organizations expressed opposition to lowering the threshold.<T3>Question 2(b). </T3>What are the potential safety benefits and economicimplications of using a 10,001 pound GVWR or an intermediate GVWR threshold?Only a few (about 10 percent) of the respondents commented directly uponthis question, generally stating that there would be few safety benefitsand considerable adverse economic impact if the threshold were loweredto 10,001 pounds GVWR. Offsetting this was the argument made by some respondentsthat not lowering the GVWR threshold for the CDL system to match the thresholdused for other parts of the Federal Motor Carrier Regulations (FMCSRs),generally 10,000 pounds, could result in confusion for enforcement personnelas well as drivers and motor carriers.<T3>Question 2(c). </T3>What current data should the FHWA consider in itsanalysis of the respective risk profiles of vehicles in the 10,001 to 26,001pounds GVWR range as compared to the safety performance of vehicles above26,000 pounds GVWR?Again, very few respondents (about 9 percent) addressed this question.Generally, the comments suggested that: (1) The FHWA undertake some detailedaccident studies, with some States offering to make available their ownaccident record system for analysis; or (2) they quoted data generatedby the National Highway Traffic Administration's Fatal Accident ReportingSystem.<T3>Question 2(d). </T3>How many additional vehicles would be subject tothe rule at 10,001 pounds GVWR?This question was addressed by only a few (about 7 percent) respondents,most of whom quoted the Bureau of Census 1982 Truck Inventory and Use Survey,which estimates that there are 2 million trucks in the 10,000 to 26,000GVWR range.<T3>Question 2(e). </T3>For vehicles below 26,001 pounds GVWR, should thenumber of articulation points be a determinant for inclusion as a commercialmotor vehicle? Should ``hot shot'' vehicles below 26,001 pounds GVWR, bedefined as a commercial motor vehicle?Very few respondents commented on this two-part question and of those whocommented only a small minority were in favor of using articulation pointsas a determinant for including a vehicle in the definition. On the otherhand, several respondents thought that ``Hot Shot'' type vehicles shouldbe included as a commercial motor vehicle. An owner-operator organizationstated:<ITAG tagnum="21">. . . These hot shot vehicles are very similar in their physical dimensionsand handling characteristics to traditional Class 7 and 8 trucks. Therefore,the association believes that the drivers of these vehicles should be subjectto the same requirements as drivers of vehicles in these classes. Whiledetailed data is not available, Association members report that driversof these vehicles are frequently less experienced in handling large vehiclesthan other over-the-road drivers.</ITAG><T3>Question 2(f). </T3>Should the number and kind of axles be a consideration?Although very few respondents addressed this question, those that did wereoverwhelmingly against using the number and/or kind of axles as a determiningfactor and suggested keeping the classification simple.<T3>Question 2(g). </T3>Should a combination of items_GVWR, axles, andarticulation points be considered?With very few comments received, the negative responses were more thantwice the number of comments favoring such a scheme. Generally, these commentersargued that the classification be kept simple.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rulemaking Action</ITAG>The FHWA does not propose to change the present definition of a commercialmotor vehicle, as set forth in andSection;383.5. The data available to theFHWA do not support extending the CDL program to vehicles in the 10,000to 26,000 pound weight range, including ``hot shot'' vehicles. Moreover,the FHWA has practical concerns that, at least during the ``start up''period of the CDL program, lowering the threshold below 26,001 pounds GVWRcould overload the States' driver licensing agencies beyond their capacity.Using the existing definition of a CMV, the FHWA originally estimated that5.5 million drivers would be affected by the CDL requirements. Until allStates have implemented their own programs, however, an accurate countof affected drivers will not be available. Such a count would decline ifStates decide to grant waivers to firefighters and certain farmers, butwould increase if States decide to include drivers not covered under theminimum Federal standards. For example, Michigan has included any vehicletowing another vehicle over 10,000 pounds in its Class A vehicle group.regardless of the gross combination weight rating. This is a more expansivedefinition for a group or class A than that included in the final commercialdriver testing and licensing published on July 21, 1988 (53 FR 27628).Regardless of the State-by-State decisions on waivers and CMV definitions,the number of drivers which States must include by April 1, 1992, in theirnew programs and in the related information system will be a significantchallenge to licensing officials.In addition, the accident statistics available to the FHWA show a muchmore serious safety problem for drivers of vehicles above 26,001 poundsGVWR. These drivers, compared to statistics for drivers of vehicles inthe 10,000 to 26,001 pound GVWR category, cause several times as many fatalitiesper driver and are involved in significantly more fatal accidents per vehiclemile traveled. These statistics imply that we can expect a greater increasein the lifesaving benefits from applying the CDL requirements to the driversof vehicles above 26,001 pounds GVWR. Extending the CDL requirements todrivers of vehicles in the 10,000 to 26,001 pound GVWR category would havesubstantially less lifesaving potential per driver. Indeed it appears fromthese data that drivers of vehicles in the 10,000 to 26,001 pound GVWRrange are even less likely than drivers of passenger vehicles to be involvedin fatal accidents. However, as required by the Act and because of thespecial potential hazards involved, the FHWA has required States to includedrivers of vehicles transporting 16 or more persons or drivers of vehicleswith placarded quantities of hazardous materials (HM) to be included intheir CDL programs regardless of vehicle weight.Meanwhile, the FHWA will continue to monitor the vehicle weight thresholdissue closely, to determine whether safety or programmatic reasons, suchas easier compliance with other Federal motor carrier regulations or consistencywith CDL programs implemented by the States, warrant a change in the weightthreshold. Both independent assessments and consultations with the variousState agencies about the progress of implementation and enforcement ofthe CDL requirements will be used to determine whether the weight thresholdshould be lowered. Also, the FHWA will continue to investigate and enforcenoncompliance with the parts 390 to 399 of the FMCSRs for vehicles whichare subject to those regulations but not to Part 383_i.e., vehicles withGVWRs between 10,000 and 26,000 pounds.<ITAG tagnum="81">Background</ITAG><T3>Question Area 3. </T3>Vehicles Transporting Hazardous Materials:The Act defines a commercial motor vehicle, in part, as any vehicle, regardlessof size, that transports most types of hazardous materials. Congress exemptedvehicles transporting certain hazardous materials of limited quantity,consumer commodity (ORM-D), and certain hazardous substances (ORM-E). Theseexemptions are limited, however, and the Act applies to millions of driverswho operate vehicles that are less than the 26,001 pounds GVWR threshold.If the broad definition of hazardous materials under the Act is used, theFHWA estimated in the June 1, 1987, final rule that the total number ofdrivers subject to the requirements would increase from 5.5 million to11.0 million drivers.Since enactment, the FHWA has received comments about the coverage of driversof vehicles transporting hazardous materials. At its public session onFebruary 4, 1987, the National Motor Carrier Advisory Committee (NMCAC),Subcommittee on Safety, proposed a limitation to include only those vehiclesrequiring placarding. The full NMCAC endorsed this proposal in a formalvote of its members.Similar suggestions were made by the State representatives at the January22, 1987, public workshop. State officials indicated that if all vehiclestransporting any nonexcluded hazardous materials were covered by the requirements,State and local law enforcement agencies would have difficulty in distinguishingbetween vehicles carrying the exempted hazardous material from those whichwere not. Moreover, enforcement agencies would have no way of distinguishingthose non-placarded vehicles below 26,001 pounds GVWR that are carryingnon-exempted hazardous materials from other vehicles below 26,001 poundsGVWR. The State representatives indicated that it would be impracticalto enforce against anything except placarded vehicles.After due consideration of these comments and the facts available to it,the FHWA determined that the regulation should be applied to vehicles belowa GVWR of 26,001 pounds only if the vehicle is transporting hazardous materialsin an amount which would require it to be placarded in accordance withthe hazardous material regulations. Thus, andSection; 383.5 defines a commercialmotor vehicle transporting hazardous materials as any vehicle, regardlessof its size, which is transporting hazardous materials in an amount requiringit to be placarded under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act andrelated regulations (49 CFR Parts 100 through 199). Vehicles larger than26,001 pounds GVWR transporting hazardous materials (regardless of placardingrequirements) are subject to the regulations due to their GVWR. However,because of differences between the Act's definition and the definitionandSection; 383.5, the FHWA requested comment on the following questionsin order to elicit additional information on the best means of administeringand enforcing the Act's provision for hazardous materials laden vehicles:<T3>Question 3(a). </T3>How many additional individuals will be subjectto the provisions of the rule if all vehicles, regardless of size, whichare transporting hazardous materials, exclusive of limited quantities,ORM-D and ORM-E, are included?Only 3 percent of the respondents attempted to quantify the number of driversthat would be affected, with several estimates running as high as 2.3 milliondrivers for just those vehicles involved in agricultural activities. California'sresponse was: ``the State of California is estimating that 300,000 Class3 drivers may have to obtain CDL's since they haul placarded materials.''Some other States estimated very large increases in their own CDL driverpopulation if the threshold were to be lowered. There were no overall estimatesgiven by any respondent.Question 3(b). What is the reasonable break distinguishing point betweenvehicles requiring placarding and vehicles with smaller amounts of hazardousmaterials being transported? Should it conform to some current criteriawhich excludes non-bulk shipments of 100 gallons or less? Should UnitedNations' packaging limits which could exclude hazardous materials quantitiesin packages of 450 liters (118.88 gallons) or 400 kilograms (881.84 pounds)or less be considered? Should there be an intermediate cutoff such as 50pounds or 10 gallons?Only 12 percent of the respondents commented on this question, the majorityof whom believed that trying to deal with anything less than placardedvehicles, under the present regulations (49 CFR Parts 100 through 199),would become a difficult, if not impossible task, especially as far asenforcement is concerned.<T3>Question 3(c). </T3>Are there entire hazardous materials classes orchemicals within classes that, because of accident experience or potentialhazard in transportation, should be included or excluded from the requirementsof the Act?Only 7 percent of the respondents directly addressed this question, andof those, very few had any suggestions pertaining to the inclusion and/orreduction of the amount of a chemical that they felt should require placarding.Also, no supporting evidence was offered for any suggested changes.<T3>Question 3(d). </T3>What accident and incident information is availablethat would make it necessary to include some smaller quantities of certainhazardous materials that will not be covered by this rulemaking (placardedamounts)?Less than 4 percent of the respondents offered information on this, butthey did not offer any statistical evidence. However, a national organizationrepresenting motorists stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">A recent study (U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, <T3>Transportation of Hazardous Material, </T3>OTA-SET-304) found thatas a general matter, the dividing line between non-bulk (small) and bulk(large) containers is 100 gallons or 1,000 pounds. According to the study,non-bulk containers make up about half of the highway traffic, but compriseabout 80 percent of the containers cited by the United States DOT's HazardousMaterials Information System as being involved in highway releases. Thestudy further states: releases from non-bulk packages of hazardous materials,while numerous, generally do not have serious consequences because of thesmall amounts of materials in the packages.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This same respondent also stated that it concurs<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * with the FHWA that the regulations should apply to vehiclesbelow a GVWR of 26,001 pounds <T3>transporting hazardous materials requiring placarding. </T3>We suggest,however, that the FHWA conduct a study to see the extent of driver contributionto accidents involving non-placarded hazardous materials transportation.Until we can be sure that there is a problem and know the extent of thatproblem, [we believe] that including those millions of drivers in the [CDL]system may be unnecessary and therefore burdensome (Emphasis added.)</ITAG><T3>Question 3(e). </T3>What accident data are available which indicatesdeaths, injuries, or property damage accidents during the transportationof certain hazardous materials? Are these data sufficiently comprehensiveand valid to be considered in any future rule?The few responses to this question can best be summarized by the commentsfrom two respondents. The first was from a State, which stated that noreliable data was available. The second, from a large public interest group,stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">In 1984 there were more than 4,000 truck involved fatal accidents.Only four deaths resulted from the release of hazardous materials. We believethat most of the fear concerning qualifications of drivers transportinghazardous materials will be reduced once we are assured that all commercialdrivers have one license, one record, are qualified to drive a truck, andpass a knowledge exam on hazardous materials.</ITAG><T3>Question 3(f). </T3>How can the provisions of the Act be enforced forhazardous material laden vehicles below 26,001 gross vehicle weight rating,other than placarded vehicles? Would enforcement be practicable if allvehicles above a certain weight rating, such as 10,000 pounds, were included?All the respondents who addressed this question (8 percent), said the onlypractical way to enforce the hazardous materials provisions of the Act,for vehicles under 26,000 pounds GVWR, was by limiting it to those vehicleswhose lading required the use of placards. Only 2 of the 255 docket respondentssuggested lowering the quantities of hazardous materials currently requiredto be placarded. One nationwide motor carrier (with a fleet of trucks under26,000 pounds) stated: ``We believe that inclusion of vehicles carryingplacardable quantities is the only practical definitional criteria thatcan be used.'' Several other respondents made similar comments. As mentionedpreviously, for example, a national organization representing motoristsstated that it:<ITAG tagnum="20">concurs with FHWA that the regulations should apply to vehicles below26,001 pounds transporting hazardous materials requiring placarding. Wesuggest, however, that the FHWA conduct a study to see the extent of drivercontribution to accidents involving non-placarded hazardous materials transportation.Until we can be sure that there is a problem and know the extent of thatproblem, [we believe] that including those millions of drivers in the [CDL]system may be unnecessary and therefore burdensome.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Related Issues</ITAG>(1) Administrative ProblemsThe FHWA estimated that as many as eleven million drivers would be affectedby this rule if a broader definition of ``commercial vehicle'' is used.Prior to, during and subsequent to the writing of the June 1, 1987, regulations,there was considerable contact with representatives of State agencies involvedin this activity. Almost without exception, State agencies expressed considerableconcern about administering the CDL program if too many drivers were included.They believe that the processing time for testing and licensing CMV driverswould become excessive. Many State officials believe that they will bebetter able to assess their capacity to serve more CDL applicants aftera phase-in period. The comments to the docket reflect these concerns.The FHWA understands these concerns. The Act requires the establishmentof an electronic information system which is referred to as a clearinghouse.This system will be designed to allow States, the Secretary and potentialemployers access to CMV driver's records from all participating licensingjurisdictions. Not only will each State need to gather and store similarCMV driver record information, but such data will need to be reported ina timely manner. Thus, the administrative burden on the States is large.(2) Enforcement ProblemsWith the inclusion of an estimated 5.5 million drivers in the testing/enforcementprogam, the current level of staffing at both the Federal and State levelwill be under extreme pressure. The CDL regulations impose new and stringentpenalties on errant drivers. For example, a driver who is convicted ofoperating a CMV while under the influence of alcohol or drugs will be suspendedfrom operating a CMV for a year for the first violation and for life fora subsequent conviction. There are also disqualification provisions forlesser violations. If the FHWA, based on experience with the CDL program,were to broaden the definition of a commercial vehicle, it was estimatedin the Final Rule issued on June 1, 1987, that the numbers of drivers thatwould be subject to the requirement could increase from 5.5 million to11 million. Considering the resources currently available to licensingthe enforcement agencies to implement the CDL program, the task could veryquickly overwhelm the States' abilities to implement the CDL program.(3) Accident InformationA prime consideration in the decision to limit the applicability of thecommercial motor vehicle definition for drivers transporting hazardousmaterials was available accident data. Motor vehicle accident and HM incidentreports received by the Department for the years 1983, 1984, and 1985 showthat an average of seven fatalities per year were a <T3>direct</T3> result of HM transportation. It is important to note herethe caveat, ``a direct result of HM transportation.'' Had these accidentsoccurred during the transportation of nonhazardous materials, the fatalitiesmay not have occurred. Considering the fact that there are hundreds ofthousands of HM shipments made daily, which account for over four billiontons of HM material moved annually, this is an enviable safety statistic.Although even seven deaths are tragic, the number is very small when consideredagainst the tens of thousands of fatalities caused by all drivers involvedin accidents while under the influence of alcohol. Another important factor to be considered is that <T3>all</T3> of these reported accidents occurred during the transportationof <T3>bulk</T3> HM. When looking at the overall picture and realizing thateighty-five percent of all HM shipments are ``small'' (non-bulk) shipments,a practical limitation to the definition of commercial vehicles appearsjustified.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rulemaking Action</ITAG>After consideration of all of the comments and data currently available,the FHWA is proposing that the definition of a commercial motor vehicle,as presently set forth in andSection; 383.5, remain unchanged for the immediatefuture. The FHWA believes that broadening the definition of commercialvehicle to include ``all vehicles transporting any amount of hazardousmaterials, exclusive of limited quantities, ORM-D and ORM-E,'' would addseveral million more drivers to the CDL system than would otherwise occur.The addition of these drivers could overload the States' driver licensingagencies far beyond their current, and for the foreseeable future, capacityto deal with CDL applicants. This could result in large numbers of unqualifieddrivers being able to continue to operate their vehicles to the endangermentof all. <ITAG tagnum="81">Background </ITAG><T3>Question Area 4. </T3>Definition of Conviction and Serious TrafficViolations: Section 383.5 defines ``Conviction'' as meaning <ITAG tagnum="20">an unvacated adjudication of guilt, or a determination that a personhas violated or failed to comply with the law in a court of original jurisdictionor by an authorized administrative tribunal, an unvacated forfeiture ofbail or collateral deposited to secure the person's appearance in court,a plea of guilty or nolo contendere accepted by the court, the paymentof a fine or court cost, or violation of a condition of release withoutbail, regardless of whether or not the penalty is rebated, suspended, orprobated. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Section 383.5 also defines a ``Serious traffic violation'' as meaning<ITAG tagnum="20">a conviction, when operating a commercial motor vehicle, of: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Excessive speeding; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Reckless driving, as defined under State or local law; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) A violation of a State or local law relating to motor vehicletraffic control (other than a parking violation) and arising in connectionwith a fatal accident. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(Serious traffic violations exclude vehicle weight and vehicle defectviolations.) The FHWA requested comment on the following questions in order to elicitadditional information on how to best clarify the meaning of these terms,and to facilitate uniform methods for administering and enforcing the CDLdriver penalties as stipulated in the Act: <T3>Question Area 4. </T3>Definition of Conviction and Serious TrafficViolations: <ITAG tagnum="81">Convictions </ITAG>The FHWA asked two questions related to the definition of Conviction andused the comments received as part of the change to the definition thatwas proposed in the notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Blood AlcoholConcentration Level for Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers, published onMay 10, 1988 (53 FR 16656). Further discussion of this definition is includedin that document and the final rule published on October 4, 1988 (53 FR39044). <ITAG tagnum="81">Excessive Speeding </ITAG><T3>Question (a). </T3>Should the FHWA define excessive speed as any speedin excess of a posted speed limit? The majority of the respondents addressing this question (11.7 percent)held that a lack of any tolerance for the posted speed limits, consideringthe severity of the penalties involved, would be far too harsh and/or unreasonable.However, several other respondents commented that ``any speed in excessof the limit'' should be considered as excessive speeding. The NationalTransportation Safety Board (NTSB) summed-up these viewpoints in stating:<ITAG tagnum="20">Given the longer distances required to stop trucks, it is especiallyimportant that truck drivers adhere to the posted speed limit. Thus, noregulation should create any implication that any speed in excess of theposted is acceptable. However, some States do create a second, more severespeeding offense for drivers who exceed the posted limit by a specifiedamount. This second, ``excessive speeding'' violation is treated more harshlywith penalties often akin to reckless driving. The use of such a systemcreates the risk of leaving an impression with drivers that some measureof speeding is acceptable thereby aggravating the existing practice amongmuch of the driving public, of exceeding the posted limit by 5 to 7 milesper hour because they know that there is little enforcement against theseviolations. However, it does enable FHWA to more precisely define the natureof speeding violation charged against a commercial driver. For example,with this offense, it would be possible to identify those who commit themost egregious speeding violations and disqualify them after a single offense.The creation of an excessive speeding offense would be acceptable to theSafety Board if it were done in such a way as to minimize the perceptionthat speeds above the posted limit but not considered ``excessive'' areacceptable. </ITAG><T3>Question (b). </T3>Should FHWA define excessive speed as a certainspeed above the speed limit? 10 m.p.h.? 15 m.p.h.? 20 m.p.h.? Of those commenters who directly addressed this question, there was noconsensus on the level at which to set ``excessive'' speeding. For example,about one-third suggested defining excessive speed as 10 m.p.h. over thelimit; almost half suggested 15 m.p.h.; about 10 percent favored eithersomething under 10 or over 15 m.p.h.; and the remaining respondents heldthat <T3>any </T3>speed above the limit should be deemed to be excessive speeding.<T3>Question (c). </T3>Should the definition be adjusted for differenttypes of highway facilities or adjacent land use development, i.e., InterstateSystem or freeways with a national posted speed limit as opposed to travelin a town or near a school? Only a few of the respondents commented on this, and all of them, exceptfor one State, felt that there should be no adjustment made. The majorityof the comments against the use of an adjustment, cited the fact that thespeed limits had been established by taking into account all of the necessarymitigating factors such as adjacent land use. Additionally, many of themobserved the difficulty this would pose for uniform CDL enforcement and/orapplication of penalties. <T3>Question (d). </T3>What limits should be written into the rule whichaddress speeding under adverse driving conditions? Should anything abovea designated speed, such as 70 m.p.h., be considered excessive speeding?There was great diversity of opinion among the few (about 10 percent) respondentswho addressed this issue. Regarding adverse conditions, the majority ofthe responses indicated that it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible,to write a rule that could properly and adequately address such an infinitevariety of different situations, as may be covered in the term ``adverseconditions''. Most of the commenters who opposed the idea mentioned thatonly the arresting officer at the scene could make a qualified judgmentas to whether or not the offender's speed was ``too fast for conditions''at the time. The NTSB commented: ``* * * any speed, even of below the postedspeed limit, which is unsafe for the conditions at that time, should beconsidered excessive.'' The NTSB went on to suggest that the FHWA incorporatethe language used in the <T3>Uniform Vehicle Code and Model Traffic Ordinance </T3>(UVCMTO), 1987Edition, published by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws andOrdinances, which states in Chapter 11, Rules of the Road, at andSection;11-801 that: ``No person shall drive a vehicle at a speed greater thanis reasonable and prudent under the conditions and having rgard to theactual and potential hazards then existing * * *.'' In response to the issue of designating a specific speed, as constitutingexcessive speed by definition, there were suggestions ranging from a lowof 70 m.p.h. to a high of 86 m.p.h. The majority, however, were in favorof keeping the rule simple by merely stating that, ``any speed of 10 or15) m.p.h. over the posted limit'' should be the sole definition of excessivespeed. <ITAG tagnum="81">Reckless Driving </ITAG><T3>Question (a). </T3>Should reckless driving constitute any driving violationwhich is contrary to State or local law? Again, relatively few comments (12.9 percent) responded to this question,of which a minority advocated a different definition from that in currentState laws. Instead, the majority wanted to retain the State definitionsof this offense. Seven respondents made a direct plea for the FHWA to definereckless driving as set forth in the UVCMTO. The 1987 Edition of the UVCMTO,published by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances,in Chapter 11, Rules of the Road, at andSection; 11-901 Reckless Driving(a) states that: ``Any person who drives any vehicle in willful or wantondisregard for the safety of persons or property is guilty of reckless driving.''Several commenters emphasized the potential problems created by the lackof a definition of what constitutes reckless driving. These were well summarizedby the comments of a truck driver who claimed 31 years of driving experience,who stated: ``Reckless driving should be defined * * * because some placesyou could get a ticket just for changing lanes without a signal light.Some places that is reckless driving.'' Several other respondents statedthat even though they did not favor any definition that differed from Statelaws, they felt that a ``Federal definition'' (of reckless driving) wouldbe necessary to facilitate the exchange of data within the CDLIS becauseof the differences in State laws. <T3>Question (b). </T3>Should reckless driving mean only those violationswhich result in injury or death? Of the few (10.5 percent) of the respondents who directly addressed thisquestion, only one thought that reckless driving should mean only thoseviolations which result in injury or death. The majority expressed commentssimilar to those of a major trucking association, which state that:  <ITAG tagnum="20">Most state laws define reckless driving as violations which are excessiveenough to be a high potential for a serious accident, regardless of whetherinjury or death results. Federal regulation should not require injury ordeath to be part of the criteria. The decision should be left to the states.</ITAG><T3>Question (c). </T3>Should reckless driving include endangerment ofthe public which does not result in injury or death but only property damage?Of the relatively few (10.1 percent) respondents who directly addressedthis question, the majority thought that reckless driving should includeendangerment, not resulting in injury or death but only in property damage,and the rest thought it should not. One State expressed its oppositionby stating: <ITAG tagnum="20">Endangerment is the key concept here, not the damage, injury, or deathpossibly resulting from it. It follows that reckless driving should includecases where, fortuitously, no damage resulted. </ITAG><T3>Question (d). </T3>Should reckless driving be determined by the Stateor local jurisdiction in which the violation occurred? Most respondents favored using the State's definitions of reckless driving,but at the same time expressed apprehension about the differences betweenthose laws. An insurance industry association reflected these concerns,when it stated: <ITAG tagnum="20">* * * the </ITAG><T3>Uniform Vehicle Code </T3>defines reckless driving as driving ``anyvehicle in willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property.''This concept, if not the exact language, is present in virtually all thestate laws. However, the FHWA should be aware that there are states thathave additional language in reckless driving provisions that describesless serious violations than those contemplated by the Act. Furthermore,it is common practice for those charged with alcohol-related driving offensesto plead guilty to reckless driving. Rather than attempting to analyzeall violations to identify those that should be classed as reckless driving,the FHWA should follow state law on the matter and identify those statesthat include less serious behavior within the definition of reckless driving.Drivers who are subject to disqualification due to reckless driving convictionsfrom those states should be allowed an opportunity to demonstrate thatthe behavior resulting in the conviction did not constitute a serious violationas contemplated by the Act. Finally, all drivers convicted of recklessdriving should be required to notify the FHWA of the original charge givingrise to the conviction. Otherwise, drivers will be able to shield alcohol-relatedoffenses from the agency by pleading guilty to reckless driving. <ITAG tagnum="81">Other Violations </ITAG><T3>Question. </T3>What other violations should be considered serious trafficviolations? A total of 18 respondents addressed this question directly. Three of theserepresenting truck and bus drivers or owner-operators, requested that nothingbe added to the present rule. The other 15 (7 of which were State agencies)requested one or more of the following types of violations be added: <ITAG tagnum="25">_Driving while operating privilege is suspended or revoked; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Improper/erratic lane changes; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Unsafe passing; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Illegal transportation of alcohol; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Following too closely; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Willful violation of out-of-service orders; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Failing to stop for a blue light; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Passing on a hill or a curve; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Using a motor vehicle as a deadly weapon; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Speeding in a school zone; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Passing a stopped school bus with flashing red lights; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Racing or drag racing on public highways; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Fleeing and/or attempting to elude a police officer; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Improper passing; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Operating a commercial vehicle while suspended, revoked, canceled,or without a commercial class license; </ITAG>Some of the respondents supported their requests with the argument thatthe violation(s) which have serious accident potential, and which are dangerousenough to make them (the suggested violation) equivalent to excessive speeding,should be included. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rulemaking Action </ITAG>The FHWA believes that Congress intended that the definition for ``excessivespeeding'' be used to identify and penalize the most severe cases of speedingviolations because the offense is included in the Act in the same categoryas ``reckless driving''. Therefore, the proposed definition is based ona specified value which separates the more serious speeding violationswhich would warrant penalties commensurate to those assigned to violationsof reckless driving from other speeding violations. The FHWA proposes thatexcessive speeding violations would occur at any speed of 15 miles perhour or more above the posted speed limit.While developing the proposed definition of excessive speeding, the FHWAconsidered whether to include in the definition repeated speeding at amountsbelow this specified value. Although the FHWA believes that driving toofast, regardless of the number of miles over the speed limit, is a violationthat should not be taken lightly, current State systems penalize habitualspeeders. Thus, a dual-part definition is not proposed as part of the Federalminimum standard. The need to place importance on speeding violations of all kinds and toimpose more stringent penalties on the drivers that are convicted of theseviolations is currently recognized by most jurisdictions. A review of theStates' existing ``safety point systems'' shows that States already distinguishbetween speeding violations that occur at lower speeds and those that occurat levels that far exceed the speed limit. For example, in Maine, a driverconvicted of speeding between 1-10 miles per hour over the speed limitis assessed 2 penalty points. That same driver would be assessed 6 penaltypoints for a conviction of 15 miles per hour over the limit. An FHWA analysisof the point systems used by 20 different States shows that violationsfor speeds of 15 miles per hour or more above the posted limits receivea greater number of points_i.e. are treated as a more serious offense_thanviolations for lower speeds. The proposed definition for excessive speedingwould create a needed uniform national penalty for the more serious speedingviolation. The States would retain, however, responsibility for penaltiesassociated with speeding violations below the 15 miles per hour threshold.The FHWA notes that the CDL telecommunication system (AAMVAnet) is nowoperational. States will be required to use the system to check commercialdriver's licenses and to transmit traffic violation convictions, includingall convictions for speeding, to the driver's home State. These requirementsshould resolve the current problem of drivers not being penalized for trafficinfractions, particularly speeding violations, which occur in other jurisdictions.The FHWA believes that these systems in conjunction with a State's pointsystem for lower level speeding violations, will adequately control theproblems associated with repeated speeding at amounts below the specifiedvalue (15 miles per hour above the posted speed limit). The FHWA believes that the proposed definition meets the intent of theCommercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act. The proposed definition would subjectdrivers to disqualification for ``excessive'' speeding, as the Act requires.While several commenters advocated penalizing all drivers who exceed thespeed limit, the FHWA believes that Congress did not intend the disqualificationprovisions to apply for all speeding convictions, but only for those thatinvolve particularly serious offenses. We invite comments on this issueand on the following specific questions: Is the standard of 15 MPH or more above the speed limit appropriate forthe entire range of speeds of concern? Should a conviction of driving 15MPH over the posted limit in a 20 MPH school zone be treated the same asa conviction of driving 15 MPH over the 65 MPH limit of a rural interstate?What other standard could be adopted that would recognize the varying hazards,yet be simple enough for all parties to readily understand? Would it beappropriate to propose a more stringent value, such as 10 miles over postedlimits per hour instead of 15 miles per hour, that would constitute a disqualifyingviolation? Regarding the definition of ``Reckless Driving'', Section 12019 of theAct states that: ``reckless driving shall be as defined under State orlocal law.'' To promote uniformity and because a majority of the Statesare already using the UVCMTO definition, the FHWA proposes to amend thedefinition of reckless driving to incorporate the language used in theUVCMTO, 1987 Edition, published by the National Committee on Uniform TrafficLaws and Ordinances. Such language states that (in Chapter 11, Rules ofthe Road, at andSection; 11-901_Reckless Driving (a)) ``Any person who drivesany vehicle in willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons orproperty is guilty of reckless driving.'' The FHWA also proposes to amendthe definition of reckless driving to clarify that it would include twoadditional traffic offenses, both of which are frequently associated withexcessive speeding and/or reckless driving. These two additional offenses,also based on definitions in the UVCMTO, are: 1. Improper/erratic lane changes (UVCMTO andSection; 11-304 through andSection;11-306); and2. Following the vehicle ahead too closely (UVCMTO andSection; 11-310). The FHWA is also proposing to amend ``Driver Disqualifications'' as definedin andSection; 383.51 (c)(2) to conform with the changes pertaining to ``excessivespeed'' and ``reckless driving''.The FHWA seeks comments on whether these two infractions should be listedas ``other serious traffic violations'' instead of including them under``reckless driving''. <ITAG tagnum="81">Background</ITAG><T3>Question Area 5. </T3>Notification of Convictions for Driver Violations:Section 383.31, as mandated by the Act, requires a CMV operator to reportall convictions of disqualifiying offenses committed in another State tohis/her employer and to the State which issued the CMV operator's license.The driver must notify the employer and the State within 30 days of thedate of his/her conviction.One purpose of the driver notification requirements to the State is toalert a State of violations which, when considered with other violationconvictions, warrant the suspension or revocation of a driver's license.When State-to-State reporting of traffic violations, required by Section12009(a) of the Act, is fully operational, a comprehensive system to ensurecomplete single license records would exist. However, it should be notedthat several State representatives indicated that a license cannot be suspendedor revoked based upon a driver's notification. States require direct andofficial notification from other States regarding convictions for trafficviolations before the State can suspend a license. In order to accommodatethis concern, it was suggested to the FHWA that the driver notificationrequirements to the State be waived if a State belongs to the Driver LicenseCompact (DLC). Presently, 35 States and the District of Columbia belongto the DLC. However, because 15 States do not belong to the DLC and becausemany States in the DLC do not fully comply with its major provisions, theFHWA specifically requested comments on the following questions concerningits use:<T3>Question 5(a). </T3>Can the DLC adequately serve the purpose of thedriver notification requirements to the State?A majority of the direct respondents to this question did not believe thatthe DLC could adequately serve this purpose. However, of the 13 Statesthat directly commented there was no clear consensus_6 of them said ``yes''and 7 said ``no.'' The concerns of several respondents were reflected inthe comments of the National Transportation Safety Board which wrote: <ITAG tagnum="20">As for the DLC, the Safety Board views it as an important means ofpreventing driver abuse of the license privilege, but it cannot serve asa substitute for the notification provision of the current rule. Not onlyis State participation in the Compact insufficient for such substitution,but so is the amount of information exchanged under the program. Many typesof violations are not transmitted under the DLC, because of lack of uniformityin the way indivudal States categorize those violations. For example, Statessuch as Nevada have had a 55-m.p.h speed limit, but if a driver there isstopped for traveling between 55- and 70-m.p.h, that offense is given adesignation other than speeding. Therefore, when reporting speeding violationsto another State, those occurrences would not be included. </ITAG><T3>Question 5(b). </T3>What level of State participation in the DLC andwhat level of State compliance with the terms of the DLC should be met,before the DLC is considered as an alternative to the notification requirements?There was a nearly equally divided response between various States andother organizations who directly addressed this question. Generally, thecomments were that the DLC could not be considered as a viable alternative,unless all States were forced to join the DLC, and forced to report allmoving violations, without making any modifications to the nature of theviolations being reported.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rulemaking Action</ITAG>It is clear both from the FHWA's own investigation and the comments tothe docket, that the Driver License Compact does not currently serve thepurpose of the driver notifications of the Act. Therefore, the FHWA doesnot propose to consider it as an option at this time.<ITAG tagnum="81">Background</ITAG><T3>Question Area 6.</T3> Notification of Employment History:The Act allows the FHWA to establish the length of the employment historyperiod, which CMV operators must provide to prospective employers, by regulation.The Congress directed that this period shall not be less than a 10-yearperiod ending on the date of application. The Act places the burden onthe job applicant to provide the employment history. It also requires thatemployers request the information from all applicants seeking employmentas a CMV operator. The FHWA realizes that it may be impossible for a potentialemployer to comply with the requirement without assistance from the applicant.Accordingly, andSection; 383.35 of the rule, requires an applicant for ajob as a CMV driver to inform the prospective employer of any previousemployment as an ``operator of a commercial motor vehicle,'' if any, forthe 10-year period before the application date. The applicant must includethe name(s) of his/her previous employer(s), dates of employment, and thereason for leaving the job(s).<T3>Question 6(a). </T3>Should the FHWA require an applicant for employmentas a commercial motor vehicle operator to provide the employer informationon all jobs, not just jobs as a commercial driver, he/she had for the 10-yearperiod prior to the date of application?A minority (40 percent) of the respondents who directly addressed thisquestion were in favor of a complete 10-year history and the rest wereagainst it. One trucking industry association suggested that it be allinclusive; but for a period of 5-years, instead of 10 years. A major busindustry association stated: <ITAG tagnum="20">(it) believes that operator applicants should be required to provideinformation on all jobs, not just jobs as a commercial driver, for theten year period prior to the application date. Such information could quiteoften be relevant to overall qualifications for a driver position.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">An insurance industry association commented that:<ITAG tagnum="21">It is essential that the employer have a complete record of a driver'slicense history that includes violations occurring during personal andcommercial driving as well as a full employment history. Without a completerecord, the employer will not have an adequate basis upon which to makedecisions about a driver's safety performance. Furthermore, it would beinappropriate to require that drivers only report employment history ascommercial drivers because former employers are a valuable source of informationon matters that bear on safety performance and reliability even if theprior employment is unrelated to commercial driving. For example, employersoften identify possible substance abuse problems before they result inconvictions or incidents that appear on official records.</ITAG><T3>Question 6(b). </T3>Should the FHWA require the applicant's employmenthistory for a period longer than 10 years?Most of the respondents who directly responded to this question were opposedto increasing the period beyond 10 years because of current record-keepingpractices and the possible administrative burdens that would result.<T3>Question 6(c). </T3>Should the FHWA require an applicant for employmentas a commercial motor vehicle operator to provide the employer with informationabout his/her driving license status and details on past license suspensions,revocations, etc.?The majority of the responses to this question agreed that the applicantshould provide such information. Two of the respondents were opposed, onea bus driver and the other an organization representing owner-operators.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rulemaking Action</ITAG>Based on the FHWA's own investigation and its review of the comments tothe docket, the FHWA believes that andSection; 383.35 as presently written,will adequately serve the purposes intended by the Act. The FHWA notesthat employers and prospective employers will have access to the informationcontained in the CDL information system and information on the driver'srecord through the State of licensure. This should enhance the employer's/prospectiveemployers' ability to check on an employee's or an applicant's past drivinghistory. From the information in the docket, the FHWA believes that a 10-yearhistory of commercial driving experience is sufficient. Therefore, theFHWA does not consider any further rulemaking action necessary.<ITAG tagnum="81">Background</ITAG><T3>Question Area 7. </T3>Disqualification of Drivers:Section 383.51 prescribes minimum driver disqualification provisions, asincluded in the Act. It specifies that drivers can not operate a CMV ifdisqualified, and that employers shall not knowingly allow or require driversto operate a CMV, if they are disqualified.The Act also provides that the FHWA may issue regulations which establishguidelines (including conditions) under which a lifetime disqualificationmay be reduced to a period of not less than 10 years. In order to assistthe FHWA in determining whether the lifetime disqualification should bereduced, and whether the disqualifying offenses should be changed, theFHWA asked for comments on the following questions:<T3>Question 7(a). </T3>Should the disqualification offense, leaving thescene of an accident, be limited only to accidents which involve an injuryor death?Of the docket comments which directly addressed this question, a majoritywere against limiting ``leaving the scene'' to only those accidents involvinginjury or death. About one-fourth thought that it should be limited tojust those kinds of accidents. The majority of the States who commentedupon this queston thought that leaving the scene of any accident was seriousenough to be considered as a disqualifying offense. However, concerns aboutapplying the same penalty for leaving the scene of a minor property damageaccident, as would be applied for leaving an accident involving eitheran injury or a fatal injury were expressed. Both an owner-operator organizationand a motor carrier association reflected the views of many respondentswhen they stated that the results of the accident (whether property damageonly or injury/death) should <T3>not</T3> be the governing criteria, rather it should be whether ornot the driver had <T3>knowingly </T3>and <T3>willfully </T3>left the scene of an accident.<T3>Question 7(b).</T3> Is there a simple way to differentiate minor fromserious incidents of leaving the scene of an accident? Of the few respondents to this question (10.9 percent), there was an almostequal split between those who stated that there was a way to do so, thosewho said there was not and those who did not know or were unsure of a wayto do so. One State suggested that a way to accomplish this would be tocopy its law, which stipulates that leaving the scene of an accident involvinginjury or death is a felony, whereas leaving the scene of an accident involvingproperty damage only, is classified as a misdemeanor. However, the majorityof State respondents who felt there was a way to differentiate, suggesteddifferent dollar amount thresholds. Several respondents referred back tothe previous question (7a) stating that the driver should be subjectedto the penalty only if he/she knowingly and deliberately had left the scene,regardless of the accident results. Several respondents pointed out thatit was entirely possible for the operator of a large commercial motor vehicleto be involved in a minor property damage accident of which he/she wasgenuinely unaware. Considering the severity of the penalty involved, manyrespondents felt it would be unfair to exact such a penalty upon a driverwho had not intentionally left the scene.<T3>Question 7(c).</T3> Should the FHWA reduce the lifetime disqualificationfor second offenders of any combination of (1) driving under the influence,(2) leaving the scene of an accident, or (3) the use of a commercial motorvehicle in the commission of a felony?Most of the respondents who addressed this question directly were in oppositionto a reduction for each item. The viewpoints expressed, however, did notfollow any pattern within the respondent groups represented. For example,the comments of the State respondents were evenly divided on this issue.Also some motor carrier groups thought the penalties too severe; whilesome driver groups did not. Several respondents thought a ``progressive''type of penalty system should be used. For example, a first offense meritinga 5-year disqualification, the second infraction a 10-year penalty, andthe third offense would be a lifetime disqualification. Furthermore, severalrespondents suggested that drunk driving penalties should be treated somewhatmore leniently than leaving the scene of an accident or the commissionof a felony. Some respondents (including several States) suggested thatthe drunk driving penalty period should be a period of 10 or 15 years forthe second offense, with a lifetime disqualification only applied to thethird offense. Another State opposed this concept when it wrote: ``. .. These are very serious offenses. This is the `teeth' of the law. Givingthe driver a third chance to operate a commercial motor vehicle would behard to defend after two previous DWI convictions.'' A State driver licensingagency raised a very important question regarding sanctions, when it commented:``First of all, we would like to comment that leaving the scene could beconsidered less severe than D.U.I. or commission of a felony. Secondly,some consideration should be given to counting ``incidents'' instead ofjust violations because of certain circumstances. For instance, a D.U.I.operator could leave the scene of an accident. <T3>Would this be considered for two penalty sanctions or would they serveconcurrently?''</T3> (Emphasis added.) The respondent then went on to arecommend that:<ITAG tagnum="20">the lifetime disqualification provision be reduced to a time definiteperiod, i.e., 10 years. Otherwise, there is no incentive for the operatorto comply with any future requirements. By providing a potential reward(future reinstatement) we are encouraging the operator to comply with theimposed sanctions.</ITAG>Many of the comments made in opposition to any reduction can be reflectedby the NTSB comment that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Each of these offenses cited represents an extremely serious violationdeserving of a serious penalty. A second infraction indicates a fundamentaldisregard for the law, and merits a lifetime disqualification. * * * Indeed,the probability of a drunk driver being arrested is so small that an individualmust drive drunk many times in order to be arrested and convicted twice.Thus, any repeat offender drunk driver should be subject to extensive rehabilitationand a lengthy disqualification period prior to any consideration of reinstatement.Certainly, no reinstatement should be considered unless there is clearevidence that the driver's alcohol problem has been completely overcome.</ITAG><T3>Question 7(d).</T3> What types of guidelines or conditions, such assuccessful completion of a rehabilitation program, should be establishedin order to reduce the lifetime disqualification?Very few respondents addressed this question directly. Most of the directresponses were in favor of some form of rehabilitation, with many methodssuggested for reduction of the lifetime disqualification. The other 40percent were against attempting rehabilitation because the current sanctionsalready allow the driver two infractions, prior to the imposition of alifetime disqualification. Three trucking associations wanted some formof rehabilitation to reduce the lifetime penalty, while a bus industryassociation and a driver association were against reducing the penalty.The majority of those favoring rehabilitation generally advocated thatthe driver undergo a 10-year disqualification period, during which timehe/she would have a clean arrest/driving record, and submit some form ofevidence that they had undergone successful treatment for their alcohol/controlledsubstances, if that had caused the disqualification. There was a conspicuousabsence of recommendations for the rehabilitation of drivers convictedof leaving the scene of an accident or the commission of a felony usinga commercial motor vehicle. A national public interest group suggestedthe following:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * 1. For a second violation occurring <T3>within</T3> 5 years of the first violation, driving under the influenceof alcohol or a controlled substance, or leaving the scene of an accidentshould result in disqualification for life. 2. For second violations occurring<T3>after</T3> 5 years from the conviction for the first violation, theSecretary should establish guidelines under which the penalty could be[reduced].</ITAG><T3>Question 7(e).</T3> Should a commercial motor vehicle operator whois convicted of the transportation, possession, or unlawful use of a ScheduleI controlled substance (in contrast to being under the influence or distributingsuch substances) be disqualified from operation of such vehicle? Shouldthe offense also cover Schedule II through V controlled substances? Whatshould be the period of disqualification for such offenses? Should theperiod be more severe for offenses involving hazardous materials ladenvehicles?This question was directly addressed by only a few (10.1 percent) respondents.Of these, most thought that Schedule I controlled substances felony offendersshould be disqualified. The question about whether or not Schedule II-Vcontrolled substances should also be included, most believed that theyshould be included as a disqualifying offense. Only about half of the respondentsdirectly answered the question about the length of the disqualificationperiod. Suggestions ranged from 1-year to lifetime disqualification, withmost advocating a lifetime penalty. The question regarding offenses involvingvehicles transporting hazardous materials was addressed by most of thegroup, with no clear consensus.The exact position of some respondents on these issues was often difficultto assess, as some answered by repeating the question in total, and thensimply responding with a ``yes'' or a ``no'' to cover all four of the questions.Other respondents addressed all, or nearly all, four of the questions,but, stated both that any driver convicted of the transportation, possession,or unlawful use of a Schedule I controlled substance (in contrast to beingunder the influence or distributing such substances) should be disqualifiedfor life, and that a lifetime penalty was too severe and that FHWA shouldreduce the penalty via required rehabilitation. It is unclear whether theserespondents suggested rehabilitation for drug users or were also recommendingit for drug dealers and/or distributors.<T3>Question 7(f).</T3> Should the 1-year or 3-year disqualification requirementsbe reduced for successful completion of a rehabilitation program? If so,what sort of rehabilitation or evidence should be provided?The majority of the respondents who directly addressed this issue opposedany reduction in the lifetime penalty and the others favored some formof reduction based upon rehabilitation. Of the States that commented, 10were in favor and 4 were opposed to a reduction of the penalty. A nationaltrucking organization reflected the comments of many other respondentswhen it stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">It is clearly the intent of Congress to provide these disqualificationsas a deterrent to committing the associated violations and to protect thepublic. [We support] these provisions and feel that disqualified driverswho seek rehabilitation need the disqualification period to prove thatthey can safely return to commercial driving.</ITAG>An organization representing owner-operator drivers felt that there shouldbe provision made for ``probationary release'' from the sanctions afterhaving completed a rehabiliation program.<T3>Question </T3>7(g). Consistent with our questions regarding requirementsfor vehicles carrying hazardous materials, how can the minimum 3-year disqualificationbe applied to vehicles transporting hazardous materials that are not placarded?There was nearly unanimous agreement that trying to enforce the programwould be extremely difficult, if not impossible, unless it involved onlyplacarded vehicles. Most believed that the rule should apply only to placardedvehicles, while some suggested expanded the placarding rules to cover allvehicles carrying any amount of hazardous materials. A few also had othersuggestions such as, ``checking waybills during roadside checks of commercialmotor vehicles,'' ``showing hazardous materials on all traffic summonsissued to commercial vehicles drivers,'' etc.<T3>Question 7(h). </T3>Should there be a mechanism to lift lifetime or10-year suspensions for disqualifications violations listed under andSection;383.37 (cite should have read andSection; 383.51)?About two-thirds of the respondents to this question favored some formof reduction, while one-third were against any reduction of the penalties.Among the 12 State respondents directly addressing this question, 8 favoredsome type of reduction, and 4 opposed it. One State's driver licensingagency stated: <ITAG tagnum="21">No, the basis for the Act was to remove problem drivers from the road.Any modifying of the disqualifications would deter from the goal of theAct. </ITAG>A national organization representing motor carriers of passengers alsovoiced opposition by stating: <ITAG tagnum="21">Does not believe that FHWA should attempt at this time to establishregulations for reducing lifetime disqualifications. The statue alreadyprovides that drivers get a second chance after committing one of thesevery serious violations and we do not see any basis for an administrativedetermination that further chances should be given. </ITAG>Respondents who favored some form of penalty reduction generally suggestedthat the FHWA consider rehabilitation programs to enable lifetime sanctionsto be reduced, but not to reduce the penalty to less than 10 years. Thosesame respondents favoring a reduction of the lifetime penalty also expressedconcerns about how it would be accomplished. For example, a State commented:<ITAG tagnum="21">Yes, but only after a minimum of 10 years has expired on a lifetimerevocation or 2 years on a 10-year revocation and then only after havingbeen processed through a State administration hearing (by Department) forpossible reinstatement on a restricted basis.</ITAG><T3>Question 7(i). </T3>If a State expunges convictions as part of a rehabilitationprogram, for example, after successfully completing an alcohol rehabilitationprogram, should FHWA lift a long term suspension because there is no longera ``conviction?''One-third of the respondents to this question favored lifting a long termsuspension, and two-thirds were opposed. There were 14 States which directlyaddressed this issue, of which 4 favored lifting the sanctions and 10 wereopposed. One State voiced its opposition by stating: <ITAG tagnum="21">It is frequent practice for a court to order the expungement of aconviction for an individual who has completed a rehabilitation program.Regardless of the expungement, the individual was convicted in a courtof law and therefore the FHWA should not lift a long term suspension becauseof the expungement and the record should stand. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The National Transportation Safety Board reflected the position ofother dissenters by stating:<ITAG tagnum="21">No. The disqualification is triggered by the conviction. It is theSafety's Board's understanding that there is nothing in the Act which allowsthe elimination of this requirement.</ITAG>The only respondents who favored the lifting of sanctions were 5 driverorganizations, 1 driver leasing company and 4 States. One State expressedits desire to lift sanctions as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">The rehabilitation program should be a condition of the dismissal.The conviction should not become a part of the driver's record unless hefails to complete an approved rehabilitation program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rulemaking Action</ITAG>The FHWA agrees with the respondents that it is not appropriate to eliminateaccidents which involve only property damage rather than personal injuryor death from the definition of disqualifying offenses. Thus, the FHWAhas not proposed to amend the list of disqualifying offenses to excludeproperty damage only accidents. Also, there is no precise way to differentiateso called ``minor'' from ``serious'' incidents of leaving the scene ofan accident. Any driver who intentionally leaves the scene of any accident,regardless of the outcome of that particular event, should be punishedfor his/her failure to comply the with law. Conversely, the FHWA recognizesthat under certain (usually rare) circumstances, it may be possible forthe driver of a large commercial motor vehicle to be involved in a minoraccident of which he/she may be genuinely unaware, and that under suchcircumstances a driver should not be penalized. Therefore, the FHWA proposesto amend andSection; 383.51(b)(2)(iii) <T3>Disqualifying Offenses, </T3>to include ``knowlingly and willfullyleaving the scene of an accident while operating a commericial motor vehicle.''To remain consistent with this proposed change, andSection; 391.15(c)(2)(iv)would similarly be changed.With respect to the issue of reducing the lifetime disqualifications, theFHWA proposes to amend andSection; 383.51(b)(3), by allowing States the optionof providing an opportunity for sanctioned drivers to apply for a reductionof their <T3>lifetime penalties only </T3>after they serve a minimum disqualificationperiod of ten years, and only after they successfully complete a requisiterehabilitation program, as determined by their State's driver licensingagency. Second, the FHWA suggests that the States form a committee to developappropriate CMV driver rehabilitation programs and standards along withstandardized procedures for monitoring the performance of reinstated drivers.Once these programs are operational, those CDL drivers who enroll in andsuccessfully complete a rehabilitation program that meets standardizedprocedures could qualify for a reduction in their lifetime sanctions afterthey serve a minimum disqualification period of 10 years. Third, to remainconsistent with the intent of the Act, the lifetime disqualification wouldnot be expunged from the driver's record for any reason even after successfulrehabilitation and reinstatement. Accordingly, the FHWA proposes that anycommercial driver's convictions of disqualifying offenses, as set forthin andSection; 383.51, would be permanently retained in the driver's CDLrecord, regardless of whether the State expunges its driver records. Thisproposal would require that a CMV driver who completes a rehabilitationprogram after being disqualified for life continues to be subject to thepenalities included in this Act.Therefore, any such reinstated driver who may be convicted of another disqualifyingoffense, would be permanently disqualified for life.Congress specifically distinguished between the duration of disqualificationfor CMV drivers which use their vehicles in the commission of a controlledsubstance felony and for CMV drivers which are convicted of other typesof offenses in section 12008(b) of the Act. Accordingly, the FHWA has notproposed to allow CMV drivers to use their vehicles in commission of controlledsubstance felonies to get a reduction of a lifetime disqualification.With regard to disqualification for convictions for the transportation,possession, or use of controlled substances, section 12008(a) of the CommercialMotor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 requires a one year disqualification fora person ``who uses a commercial motor vehicle in the commission of a felony(other than a felony described in subsection (b)).'' A second convictionfor an offense of this type requires a lifetime disqualification. Felonydrug convictions for transportation, possession, or use of controlled substanceswould be covered by this provision, which was codified in the June 1, 1987,final rule.Discussion of Other IssuesItem 1. Proposed clarification of how to apply sanctions when more thanone disqualifying offense occurs simultaneously:Several commenters have asked how sanctions should be applied when two(or more) disqualifying offenses occur simultaneously, or as part of asingle incident, such as leaving the scene of an accident during the commissionof a felony with a commercial motor vehicle. Although the FHWA did notraise any specific questions on this issue in the final rule publishedon June 1, 1987, the issue is addressed with respect to disqualificationfor life by the Model CDL Law Subcommittee of the American Associationof Motor Vehicles Administrators (AAMVA) in their most recent (sixth) draftof the ``Model Uniform Commercial Driver License Act'' (section 12). Theapproach taken in the model law is to disqualify for life a person whois convicted of two or more violations of the nature which result in alifetime disqualification only where the convictions arise from two ormore separate incidents. The FHWA believes that this approach is consistentwith the intent of Congress because the Act mandates a series of increasinglystringent periods of disqualification for second and subsequent offenses.The FHWA believes that these increasingly stringent periods of disqualificationswere intended to address subsequent, separate offenses rather than multipleoffenses arising out of a single incident. Thus, the FHWA proposes to clarifythat the driver be disqualified for life if he or she is convicted foroffenses which arise from two or more separate incidents. This clarificationis included in andSection; 383.51(b)(3)(iv). Similar language is includedin andSection; 383.51(c)(2) (i) and (ii) dealing with serious traffic violations.Item 2. Proposal to amend andSection; 383.1 (b)(2) and (b)(5) to clarifyreporting requirements:As currently written, andSection; 383.1(b) specifies the requirement to report``certain violations and suspensions'' and penalties for various ``violations.''It fails to identify the specific types of ``violations'' being addressedand that the requirement is limited to the reporting of<T3> convictions</T3> of certain criminal offenses, serious traffic violations(with the exception of parking violations, vehicle weight and equipmentdefects), and any suspensions, revocations, or cancellations of certaindriving privileges. The FHWA proposes, therefore, to amend andSection; 383.1(b)(2)to clarify that a driver is required to notify both his/her employer andhis/her State of domicile of<T3> all convictions</T3> of certain criminal offenses, serious trafficviolations, and any suspensions, revocations, or cancellations of certaindriving privileges. The FHWA also proposes to amend andSection; 383.1(b)(5)to clarify that the penalties pertain to<T3> convictions</T3> of certain criminal offenses, serious traffic violations,and any suspensions, revocations, or cancellations of certain driving privileges.Additionally, FHWA proposes to amend andSection; 383.31 (a) and (b) to clarifythat such notification must be given within 30 days after the person isconvicted.Item 3. Proposal to clarify the requirements for casual, intermittent oroccasional type driver employees under Part 383:Due to the fact that a casual, intermittent or occasional type of driverhas no ``regular employer'' per se, the present regulations are unclearas to whom such casual, intermittent or occasional drivers should reporttheir convictions of disqualifying offenses, as set forth in andSection;383.51. Therefore, the FHWA proposes to amend andSection; 383.5 definitionof<T3> ``Employee''</T3> to include all casual, intermittent or occasionaltype drivers. It is also proposed to amend andSection;andSection; 383.1(b)and 383.31(b) to clarify that drivers must notify their current employerand State of licensure of any such convictions. If the driver is not currentlyemployed, he/she must still notify the State of licensure.Item 4. Proposal to impose penalties for falsification of required informationunder Part 383:All States currently have laws which deal with falsification of informationon license documents. These laws, however, are not consistent. As partof the minimum standards for licensing and testing CMV operators, the FHWAincluded a requirement that States must impose a penalty on a CDL applicantwho is discovered by the State to have falsified information required forthe CDL. The FHWA believes that a minimum level for such penalties needsto be established to ensure similar treatment of CMV operators across thecountry. Such penalties would also help deter an applicant from attemptingto get a second license or a new CDL during the time he/she is disqualified.Therefore, the FHWA is proposing to amend andSection; 383.53 to provide minimumpenalties of at least a 60-day license suspension, revocation or cancellationfor States to apply to those persons who knowingly falsify or evade submittingrequired information when applying for an initial CDL, a CDL renewal ora CDL from a new State of domicile.Item 5. Proposal to clarify when the period of disqualification shouldbegin:Several questions have been raised to the FHWA about whether the periodof time for which a driver may be disqualified is to begin on the dateof the violation or the date of conviction. Because the Act requires thatdrivers be disqualified when they are ``found to have committed'' certainoffenses, the FHWA believes that the disqualification period should beginat the time when the driver is convicted of the disqualifying offense.Thus, the FHWA proposes to amend both andSection; 383.51 (b)(1) and (c)(1)to clarify, in the general rule statement, that the driver would be disqualifiedat the time he/she is convicted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact</ITAG>This notice is based on comments made on the procedures promulgated June1, 1987, to implement the statutory provisions of the Commercial MotorVehicle Safety Act of 1986. At that time, the FHWA determined that theseactions did not constitute a major rule under Executive Order 12291. Theamendments to the final rule that would result from this notice are notexpected to result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore, or lead to a major increase in costs or prices, or have significantadverse effects on the United States economy. Because of the public interestin the issue of commercial motor vehicle safety and the expected benefitsof improved transportation safety, however, this notice is considered significantunder the regulatory policies and procedures of the DOT. For this reasonand pursuant to Executive Order 12498, this rulemaking action has beenincluded on the Regulatory Program for significant rulemaking actions.The economic impacts of this rulemaking that will occur are primarily mandatedby the statutory provisions themselves. For this reason, a full regulatoryevaluation is not required. However, since an analysis of impacts, includingeconomic factors, is necessarily involved in the preparation of relatedmotor vehicle safety regulations, a regulatory evaluation was preparedfor the rulemaking actions needed to implement the Act. This evaluationaddresses the provisions contained in this notice, has been placed in thepublic docket and is available for inspection in the Headquarters officeof the FHWA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. A significant part of the motor carrier industry and other employers coveredby the Act are made up of small firms, from one-person, one-truck operationsof some owner-operators, to the thousands of small fleet operators throughoutthe country. For this reason, the benefit and cost considerations describedin the regulatory evaluation/regulatory flexibility analysis as applicableto employers and the motor carrier industry in general, are equally applicableto the small entity component of the industry. Small entities have beenrepresented at public meetings held to discuss the Act and small entitieshave had the opportunity to submit comments to the public docket establishedin conjunction with FHWA's August 1, 1986, ANPRM as well as the severalother rulemaking notices required by the Act. The FHWA is fully committedto doing all that it can to ensure that no undue burdens are placed onsmall entities as a result of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Impact</ITAG>The FHWA has reviewed the proposed changes to the Commercial Driver LicensingStandards in light of the purposes of the Act and the President's ExecutiveOrder on Federalism (Executive Order 12612, October 26, 1987). In enactingthe Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986, the Congress found thatit is in the public interest to enhance commercial motor vehicle safety.Congress identified commercial motor vehicle safety as a matter of nationalimportance and included requirements for a single license and driver disqualificationsas part of the mandates in the Act. In his Executive Order on Federalism, the President ordered Executive Departmentsand agencies to be guided by certain fundamental federalism principlesin formulating and implementing policies that have federalism implications.These policies have been taken fully into account in the development ofthe proposal. This proposal would limit the policy making discretion ofthe States only in narrow ways, and does so only to achieve the nationalpurposes of the act. For example, States would continue to have sole discretionas to whether or not to license any CMW operator and what specific procedures,tests, fees or penalty applications are applicable. Thus, it is certifiedthat the policies contained in this document have been assessed in lightof the principles, criteria, and requirements of the Federalism ExecutiveOrder, and accord fully with the letter and spirit of the President's Federalisminitiative. A regulatory information number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory actionlisted in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations. The Regulatory InformationService Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of eachyear. The RIN number contained in the heading of this document can be usedto cross reference this action with the Unified agenda. For the foregoing reasons and under the criteria of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, the FHWA hereby certifies that, if promulgated, this action will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The collection of information required by the final rule published on June1, 1987, to implement the single license and certain reporting and notificationrequirements has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMBNo. 2125-0542). No additional burdens are expected to result from thisrulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Parts 383</ITAG>Commercial driver's license standards requirements and penalties, Highwaysand roads, Motor carriers' Motor vehicle safety, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements. <ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.217, motorcarrier safety.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued on: January 24, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.
