At issue is the Central Bank of China's desire for astable currency and Taipei's stated policy of letting inforeign funds for direct investment in the stock market.</LP><TEXT>   Having allowed the New Taiwan dollar to appreciate 7%against the U.S. dollar in the past six months, the centralbank apparently has set a target exchange rate of NT$25 toUS$1. But earlier this month, money brought in by severalpreviously approved foreign funds for direct investment inTaiwan shares exerted so much upward pressure on the localcurrency that the target was moving out of range.   Subsequently, the central bank suspended approvals forthree institutional investors to bring in funds: BanqueIndosuez of France, which applied to bring in US$50 million;Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. of the U.S., US$44 million; and JohnGovett andamp; Co. of Britain, US$40 million.   But faced with criticism from other finance officials andthe foreign business community, the central bank hasbackpedaled somewhat. In an interview, central bank Gov.Samuel Shieh said there is &quot;a slowdown&quot; in the approvalprocess of these investment funds, adding that approval islikely if the fund managers agree to bring in smaller amountsand over a longer period of time.   Few doubt that investment flows will resume fairly soon,when the upward pressure on the local currency eases. But thecentral bank's heavy-handed approach already has hurtTaiwan's credibility abroad. Foreign fund managers andgovernment finance officials charge that the central bank'slatest move is undermining public confidence in Taiwan'slongstanding goal of integrating local financial markets withglobal markets.   &quot;Like a woman with bound feet, Taiwan is proceeding withliberalization in very hesitant steps,&quot; says the chiefexecutive officer of a big local bank.   Brushing aside such criticism, Mr. Shieh said, &quot;We'recommitted to liberalization and internationalization of theeconomy in the long term, but in the short term, we also liketo support&quot; a measure of stability in foreign-exchange rates.He denies, however, targeting specific currency levels.   Mr. Shieh's statement points directly to the potentialconflict between financial liberalization and currencycontrols -- a conflict that has become evident with therecent hiccups in flow of foreign investment funds.   Taiwan's opening of its stock market to foreign directinvestment at the beginning of 1991 is often cited byauthorities as a major step in financial modernization. Priorto that, foreign investors had been able to invest indirectlyin Taiwan shares through four investment trusts that arelisted on the New York and London stock exchanges.   In addition, the Ministry of Finance had hoped that theintroduction of professional investors would help calmTaiwan's volatile stock market. The market-opening measurescame after the weighted price index fell 80% over sevenmonths to a low of 2525 in October 1990.   While the stock market was being opened, however, thecentral bank remained intent on guarding the foreign exchange market from currency speculation. That was evident intough restrictions on the flow of foreign capital that camewith the stock-market opening.   For example, all funds had to be brought into Taiwan threemonths after an investment application was approved; theperiod was later extended to six months. In addition, allprincipal had to remain in Taiwan for at least three months,and capital gains on investments could be repatriated onlyonce a year.   The rules may have been aimed at discouragingforeign-exchange speculation and short-term stock trading,but they also damped foreign interest in the market. MostU.S. pension-fund managers are prevented from investing inTaiwan because corporate guidelines or trustee agreementsprohibit restricted access to fund capital.   &quot;Last year, SEC officials came to beg us to apply to bringmoney in,&quot; says a foreign fund manager based in Taipei,referring to Taiwan's Securities and Exchange Commission, theFinance Ministry unit in charge of the market opening.   Foreign interest in Taiwan's stock market started to pickup late last year. Unfortunately, that was around the sametime the central bank began acting in earnest to stabilizethe currency.   In the last quarter of 1991, the bank reduced domesticdiscount rates several times in line with similar reductionsin the U.S. to discourage idle funds and speculative moneyfrom coming into Taiwan. The bank later began buying U.S.dollars to slow down the pace of the New Taiwan dollar'sappreciation.   But the local currency resisted the efforts and started toappreciate, with its pace quickening in January and much ofthis month. The increase has been due largely to a strongshowing in exports that resulted in the first rise inTaiwan's trade surplus in two years. Such gains sparkedconcern among local businessmen and government officials thatthe currency's higher value would hurt competitiveness bymaking the country's exports more expensive for foreignbuyers.</TEXT></DOC>
