Chinese mountaineers in the 30-member climbing team were delayedmore than a week in reaching the United States for practice climbingon Mount Rainier because of restrictions on travel in Chinafollowing the military crackdown there.   The team, comprised of 10 citizens of each country, plans to headfor Mount Rainier on Saturday after planning sessions and afund-raising reception.   Whittaker said the team will train at least through Tuesday at abase camp and a high-level camp that have been established on the14,410-foot peak 60 miles southeast of Seattle.   The climb next year is intended to show that people from thethree nations can work together to reach the highest point on Earth,said Whittaker, who in 1963 became the first American to stand atopEverest. He said it's the first time mountaineers from the threecountries have joined in a major climb.   ``We will stand on the summit of Everest, three people, one fromeach country, with our arms around each other because we arebrothers, not only under one sun, but brothers as mountainclimbers,'' he said.   The group will try to get as many climbers as possible to thesummit of the 29,028-foot Himalayan mountain, he added.   The mountaineers hope to get the first team onto the peak onApril 22, the 20th anniversary of Earth Day, Whittaker said.   The expedition plans to pack its own trash down the mountain andbring out as much trash from previous climbs as possible. Greenpeaceand other environmental groups have volunteered to help removewaste, Whittaker said.   The climbers plan to approach the mountain's north side throughChina and Tibet. The cost of the expedition was put at $1 million,and Whittaker said additional sponsors were being sought.   Pressed about the turmoil in China, Whittaker said he welcomedthe publicity it drew to the expedition.   ``We'd like the events of the past few weeks to focus on thisgroup of citizens that are working together for a common goal ofpeace, and the human environment,'' he said.   ``I think there is even more reason for this group to betogether. We had no idea that those problems would occur.''   But, Whittaker said, the expedition ``is even more important forthe citizens of this world ... When we rope up on that mountain weare trusting our lives to each other. I think we have to do that ascountries.''   The Chinese delegation leader said the Chinese recognize theAmerican and Soviet climbers are more experienced. ``We will be thepupils.''   Soviet leader Vladimir Shatayev said he was eager to get back tomountain climbing. ``We're happy our Chinese friends have come toclimb,'' he said through an interpreter.</TEXT></DOC>
