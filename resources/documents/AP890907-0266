British Petroleum, the world's third-largest oil concern in salesafter Exxon Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Group, said Robert Hortonwill replace Walters as chairman. Horton, 50, former chief executiveof British Petroleum's U.S. subsidiary based in Cleveland, Ohio, wasappointed deputy chairman on March 1.   Walters, 58, has been managing director of the company for 17years and chairman since 1981. He was knighted in 1984.   He had been poised to step down this year and take over aschairman of National Westminster Bank, but could not come to termswith the bank. He resigned from BP's board in August.   Earlier this year, Walters drew criticism within the company foraccepting a 48 percent increase in his compensation to 514,558pounds, or about $800,000 at current exchange rates.   When he became chairman in 1981, Walters said he hoped torestructure the company within 10 years and then retire.   His first moves were to sharply reduce BP's refining capacity inEurope, turning a $1 billion-a-year loss to a $1 billion profitwithin four years.   Since the start of the decade, BP's European refining capacityhas been cut by 57 percent.   Horton was in charge of cutting losses in BP ChemicalsInternational group.   During Walters' term, BP acquired the outstanding 45 percentminority interest of Standard Oil for $7.8 billion in 1987 andundertook the 2.5-billion-pound-takeover, about $4 billion, ofBritoil last year.   The full takeover of Standard Oil has allowed BP to integrate itsU.S. operations under BP America, and to call off a disastrousexploration program that cost Standard billions of dollars. Half ofBP's assets are now in the United States.   The acquisition of Britoil gave BP a major stake in the North Seaas a hedge against declining production. Although the company hassaid it can maintain production of 1.7 million barrels a day untilthe mid-1990s, its two main oil fields, Forties in the North Sea andPrudhoe Bay in Alaska, have both peaked.   Walters, a native of Birmingham in central England, joined BP in1954 and was involved mainly with the company's international oilsupply organization, including assignments to the New York office in1960-62 and, as vice-president of BP North America Inc., in 1965-67.   In 1971 he was appointed BP's regional director for the WesternHemisphere, Australasia and Far East. He was named deputy chairmanin 1980.   The company did not announce Walters' plans following retirement.   Horton joined BP in 1957, and was appointed general manager ofthe BP Tanker Co. in 1975. The next year, he was appointed generalmanager of BP Group's Corporate Planning Department.   In 1980 he became chief executive officer of BP ChemicalsInternational. He was elected to the board in December 1983 as amanaging director with responsibility for finance, planning and theWestern Hemisphere.   He resigned from British Petroleum in 1986 to become chairman andchief executive officer of Standard Oil. Following the merger of BPand Standard in 1987, he was appointed chief executive officer of BPAmerica.   In February, British Petroleum reported that after-tax profit in1988 fell 13 percent to 1.21 billion pounds on an historical costbasis from 1.39 billion pounds in 1987.   Current cost after-tax profit rose 10 percent to 1.44 billionpounds, or about $2.55 billion, from 1.31 billion pounds. Per-shareearnings declined to 20 pence, or 35 cents, from 24.9 pence.   Sales for the year fell 8 percent to 25.9 billion pounds from28.3 billion pounds a year earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
