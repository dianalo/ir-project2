ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   The long 1988 campaign, often more negative than enlightening, isracing to a close with George Bush and Michael Dukakis offeringcompeting visions of ``a better America,'' and thousands of othercandidates wary of fallout from the presidential race.   More than 90 million Americans will go to the polls on Nov. 8 toselect a successor to Ronald Reagan, choose one-third of the Senateand the entire House.   Twelve states will elect governors. Thousands of other races forstate and local offices as well as scores of initiatives will be onballots throughout the country.   For the Democrats, the prospects were for continued sway overCongress _ their Senate majority only a longshot risk, their Housecontrol secure. Democrats also were optimistic about adding up tofour governors to their ranks.   But in Election Day's biggest contest, Dukakis was an underdog inhis bid to recapture the White House for the Democrats after twoRonald Reagan landslides.   Republican Bush, who found a political as well as moral virtue inloyalty to his chief, was bidding to become the first sitting vicepresident since Martin Van Buren in 1836 to win election to thepresidency.   While polls gave Bush the edge going into the final week, theyalso profiled an electorate unhappy with the choice and the negativetone of the campaign.   ``I think there's a kind of reluctance for people to committhemselves to one of two people, neither of whom they like,'' saidI.A. Lewis, chief of polling for the Los Angeles Times.   ``Neither of these guys seems to attract the kind of commitmentthat some other presidential candidates have had,'' said LarryHugick, of the Gallup Organization.   Those assessments suggested to Dukakis strategists an opportunityfor a last-minute shift in sentiment. The Massachusetts governor wasclosing out his campaign with a strong populist message combinedwith counterattacks against Bush commercials portraying him as softon crime and defense.   Dukakis portrayed Bush as the candidate of the rich who wouldbenefit from his own proposal for a cut in capital gains taxes andsaid the Republican nominee was ``running a campaign based ondistortions and distractions _ and outright lies. Why? Because hecan't win an election where the real issues are discussed.''   Bush countered: ``There are signs showing in the opposition campof desperation _ using ads that accuse us of lies.''   The competing candidates crossed paths regularly in the bigstates crucial to their hopes of gaining the 270 electoral votesneeded for election. Voters in California, New York, Illinois, Ohio,Michigan, and Pennsylvania had the best chance of seeing one or bothof the candidates in person.   For most Americans, the best view was 30-second glimpses on theirtelevision sets.   Both candidates, who began their fall campaigns with $46.1million in federal funds, were expected to buy 30 minutes of networktime for election-eve appeals to voters.   Watching the presidential campaign with uncommon interest wereother candidates, particularly Democrats with vivid memories of the1980 Reagan landslide in which Republicans picked up 12 Senate seatsto gain control of the body for the first time in a quarter century.   Democrats regained a Senate majority in 1986 and entered thecurrent campaign with a 54-46 edge.   Of the 33 Senate seats contested this year, 18 are held byDemocrats and 15 by Republicans. Six incumbents _ three in eachparty _ did not run for re-election.   Democrat Charles Robb appeared certain to pick up the openRepublican seat in Virginia, where he is a prohibitive favorite overRepublican Maurice Dawkins.   The race for another GOP open seat in Washington was considered atossup between former Republican Sen. Slade Gorton and DemocraticRep. Mike Lowry.   Republicans were optimistic about their chances to win openDemocratic seats in Mississippi and Florida.   Two Republican incumbents were on the highly endangered list _Chic Hecht of Nevada and David Karnes of Nebraska.   Among Democrats, the incumbents with the strongest challengeswere Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio.   ``With good breaks, a strong top-of-the-ticket effort which we'regetting ... and with general good luck, we could do it,'' saidRepublican Senate campaign committee spokesman Tom Mason when askedwhether the GOP can win the seats they need _ five if there is aDemocratic vice president, four if there is a Republican, to claimcontrol of the Senate.   In the House, strategists in both parties were predicting minimalshifts from the current lineup of 255 Democrats and 177 Republicans.Three seats are vacant.   No one was predicting a shift of more than five seats for eitherparty.   In races for governor, the Democrats appeared to have a goodchance to enlarge their current 27-23 edge nationwide.   The most endangered incumbents were Republicans Edward DiPrete ofRhode Island, Norman Bangerter of Utah, and Arch Moore of WestVirginia. In addition, Democrat Evan Bayh was favored in the race tosucceed Republican Gov. Robert D. Orr of Indiana, who was ineligiblefor another term.   While candidates often hoped for a boost from presidential racecoattails, that was usually an elusive advantage.   The 1980 Reagan landslide was credited with helping manyRepublican candidates, but when he carried 49 states in 1984, hisparty lost two Senate seats.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
