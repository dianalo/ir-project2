Cassity, director of command, control, communications andcomputers (C4) systems for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said budget cutsactually may result in increased spending on computers.andM;&quot;As the overall DOD budget goes down, the C4 budget may go up,&quot; he said.andM;Maj.andP;  Gen.andP;  John Studds, the Marine Corps' chief of staff for C4 systems,said his service's experience might provide a glimpse of how cutbacks inpersonnel, facilities and weapons systems will increase C4 budgets.andP;  theoverall Marine budget has been cut about 60 percent since 1982.andP;  But duringthat same time, C4 spending has gone up about 30 percent, he said.andM;When measured against inflation rates, the services' proposed 1991 budgetsare flat, officials have said.andP;  Many administrative systems on the drawingboard have been delayed, canceled or revised in light of the DOD corporateinformation management (CIM) plan to consolidate like systems.andM;Though weapons systems are taking heavy cuts, &quot;command and control systemsrepresent a growh niche in a declining industry,&quot; said Maj.andP;  Gen.andP;  Robert H.andO;Ludwig, commander of the Air Force Communications Command.andM;Maj.andP;  Gen.andP;  Peter A. Kind, then the Army's C2 program executive officer,agreed.andP;  &quot;Telecommunications and automation are doing well and will continueto do so,&quot; he said.andM;The Navy's director of space, command and control, Vice Adm.andP;  Jerry O.andO;Tuttle, was more cautious about funding for strategic information andcommunications systems supporting warfare planning in Europe.andM;&quot;The Cold War in Europe kept strategic systems funded.andP;  I'm not sure that[funding] will continue,&quot; he said.andM;The cuts already are affecting the way the military uses C3 systems inEurope.andP;  Cassity said communications equipment and lines likely will beleased.andM;Lt.andP;  Gen.andP;  Harry Soyster, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, saidsecurity will be accomplished by the installation of encryption devices ateither end of leased lines.andM;He said officials still are concerned about wartime reliability of leasedtelecommunications lines and equipment and will work out warfare clauses inthe deals they make with European providers.andM;Another speaker, Thomas Buckholtz, commissioner of the General ServicesAdministration's Information Resources Management Service, said the demandfor information services throughout the gobernment remains on the increase.andO;&quot;I suspect budgets will do pretty well,&quot; he said.andM;Buckholtz advised the military officials to link IRM planning to theiroverall strategic business plans wherever possible.andM;&quot;That will help you get the funding you need,&quot; he said.andM;The proposed budget cuts might seem to have created what one defensecontractor described as hesitancy within DOD.andM;&quot;The DOD people have money to spend, but they seem to be making theirdecisions more slowly than in the past,&quot; said William A. Terry, vicepresident of sales and marketing for Active Memory Technology Inc. (AMT) ofIrvine, Calif.andM;&quot;That can be particularly tough on smaller subcontractors like ourselves,&quot; hesaid.andP;  AMT manufactures massively parallel computing devices.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
