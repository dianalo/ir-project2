Most of those being laid off have been notified and will havetheir last days on the job Friday, company spokesman Paul Bernishsaid.   The layoffs ``basically cover everything from vice president tothe secretary level,'' Bernish said. About 500 employees willremain at Kroger's headquarters.   Kroger, the nation's largest supermarket operator, said thelayoffs and elimination of associated costs will save the companyat least $13 million a year.   ``There is nothing more difficult than terminating the jobs ofso many dedicated and loyal employees. However, major expensereductions are critical to the successful implementation of ourrestructuring program,'' Kroger chairman Lyle Everingham said.   Company officials said all of the affected employees are beinggiven ``separation packages'' that provide a maximum of six to ninemonths' salary and continuing health-and-life insurance coveragefor up to one year. The packages also include pay for unused 1988or 1989 vacation time, company-paid job placement assistance or upto $2,500 reimbursement for tuition expenses.   Everingham and Kroger president Joseph Pichler had said lastweek that the layoffs, along with sales of some company stores,real estate and food-processing plants, would all be part of therestructuring.   This week, the Maryland-based Haft family, which has areputation as a corporate raider, offered Kroger help in fightingoff a takeover bid in a contest the Hafts started.   The Hafts, who control Dart Group Inc., the company which lastmonth began the bidding competition for Kroger, issued a statementWednesday that some analysts interpreted as an offer of assistanceto help Kroger fend off a threat from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp;Co., a New York corporate takeover specialist.   ``We would be interested in working with Kroger management toenhance the restructuring program by providing additional equity,''Dart executive Robert Haft said in his one-line statement,referring to Kroger's proposed $4.6 billion, corporaterestructuring plan.   Kohlberg's latest buyout offer is a $5.03 billion proposal madeTuesday. Kroger publicly is still sticking to its commitment torestructure itself and remain independent, rather than be takenover. But industry analysts say the Kohlberg offer appears morelucrative to Kroger shareholders, which would prevent Krogermanagement from simply shrugging off the Kohlberg offer.   Haft made his statement after learning rival Kohlberg hadincreased its bid Tuesday for Kroger, which is based in Cincinnati.The Hafts, of Landover, Md., opened the Kroger bidding Sept. 19with an unsolicited offer of $55 per share, or $4.32 billion. TheHafts have made no offer to increase their proposal.   Kohlberg, in the best deal to date, proposes paying $50 in cash,$11 in debentures and a continuing equity interest in the companyvalued at $3 for each of Kroger's 78.6 million shares _ a dealworth $64 a share.   Kroger has offered in its restructuring program, which wouldrequire layoffs and sale of some company stores and food processingplants, to pay shareholders a $40 cash dividend, a debenture with atrading value of $8 and a ``stub'' share of stock that companyofficials say will trade at between $9 and $13 per share.   Wall Street investors, however, estimate the stub's value at aslow as $5 per share.   If Kroger were to turn to the Hafts for help, the family wouldnot represent a friendly alternative, said Gary Giblen, an analystwith Houston investment adviser Rotan Mosle Inc. ``They are hardlywhite knights. They're more like gray knights,'' Giblen said.   This is not the first time the Hafts have competed with Kohlbergfor a takeover target. But in the past, companies have made dealswith Kohlberg to be rescued from the Hafts.   ``It would be pretty funny to welcome the Hafts in with openarms,'' Giblen said. ``Usually you welcome Kohlberg. This is a realswitch-a-roo.''   At least four shareholders' lawsuits have been filed againstKroger, contending that its restructuring plan would not be in theshareholders' best interests.   The 105-year-old Kroger Co. has 170,000 employees and 52,000shareholders. The company's main businesses are its supermarketsand convenience stores.</TEXT></DOC>
