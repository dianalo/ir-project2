It was not immediatelyknown whether any of those who died was from the Bay Area.;    The jetlinerskidded off the runway, across a taxiway, slammed into an abandoned airportfire station and burst into flames.;    Its nose was shattered, a huge holeopened on top of the forward section, and the fuselage broke apart ahead ofthe tail section. Black smoke and orange flames boiled out of the windows andragged holes in the wreckage.;    &quot;I saw a flash, then this streak of flamesgoing down the runway. There were people jumping from the front and back ofthe plane,&quot; said nearby resident Gretchen Emig.;    Claudia Hawkins waspulling her airport shuttle bus, full of passengers, into the parking lot whenthe flash appeared in the sky.;    In unison, it seemed, the dozen of themyelled, &quot;Look!&quot;;    &quot;It was a ball of fire,&quot; Hawkins recounted. &quot;One young mansaid he thought for sure he saw the tail end of a plane fall off. First thingeverybody thought was, it was a bomb. What else are you supposed to think?&quot;;   Wartime security is in force at the airport, as at others across the country.But an FBI spokesman said that there was no evidence of terrorism in thecrash.;    Jeff Rich, an investigator with the National Transportation SafetyBoard, said 10 passengers and two crew members were aboard the commuter plane,Skywest Flight 5569, which was leaving for Palmdale, about 50 miles northeastof Los Angeles airport.;    The craft, a twin turbo-prop Fairchild Metroliner,has two pilots and can carry 19 passengers.;    USAir officials said theBoeing 737-300 carried 83 passengers and a crew of six -- two pilots and fourflight attendants.
