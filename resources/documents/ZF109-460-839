Andrews, corporate manager ofsales at The Consulting Team, a consulting firm in West Palm Beach, Fla.andO;&quot;The upper echelon of management is looking at the profitability of theorganization being acquired.andP;  Once the decision is made, they go to HR andask them to evaluate staffing.andM;&quot;The organizations that are recognizing the value of HR will go more and moreto HR to obtain that kind of information,&quot; said Andrews.andM;Observers agree that the role of the HR professional has changed radicallyover the last decade.andM;&quot;In many organizations, human resources was lowly regarded and lightlystaffed,&quot; said James E. Spoor, founder and president of Spectrum HumanResource Systems Corporation, Denver, which develops and marketsmicrocomputer-based HR systems.andP;  &quot;Now, HR professionals are part of theprofit management.&quot;andM;&quot;HR used to be considered an overhead, a nonprofit entity, a necessary evilif you will.andP;  Now HR is becoming more and more of a support organization,&quot;said Andrews.andM;According to a study by KPMG Peat Marwick of 287 firms, ranging from Fortune500 companies to small businesses, the importance of the human resourcefunction increased in most companies during the 1980s.andP;  The study found that53% of the senior HR officers report directly to the CEO.andM;Along with the changing role of HR, the HR professional is becomingincreasingly more technical, though observers disagree on the definition of&quot;technical.&quot;andM;The KPMG Peat Marwick study also found that &quot;one out of every 12 HR employeesin medium and large companies is a systems professional.andP;  In some of thelarger organizations, separate Human Resource Information Centers (HRIC)--anenclave of systems professionals within the HR department--have been formed.andO;The systems professionals are typically responsible for training other HRprofessionals, acting as a liaison with the MIS department and developingspecialized HR applications.&quot;andM;&quot;Users are still nontechnical,&quot; said Spectrum's Spoor.andP;  &quot;They don't care toget involved with the mysteries of DOS.andP;  The typical HR user has too manyother things to do.andP;  The pattern is toward easier end-user access.andM;&quot;HR is tired of being told by MIS that they [have to wait for their data].andO;HR people want to own their data,&quot; Spoor said.andM;According to Ron Groess, president, the Association of Human ResourcesSystems Professionals (HRSP), Dallas, HR professionals will be moretechnically oriented, &quot;but maybe not 'systems' oriented.andP;  HR people need toknow the mechanics of getting at the information,&quot; he said.andP;  Groess isbenefits system manager at 3M in St. Paul, Minn.andM;&quot;The attempt is to not require them to be more technical,&quot; said MichaelBlair, president, Cyborg Systems, Chicago.andP;  Cyborg offers the SAA-compliantSolution Series, which includes HRMS, payroll and time and attendancesoftware.andM;One of the benefits of technical proficiency is that HR professionals are nolonger as reliant on MIS to unravel the mysteries of their system.andM;&quot;Many HR people are becoming more attuned as to what the systems will do.andO;They're taking control of their own data,&quot; said The Consulting Team'sAndrews.andM;Research from KPMG Peat Marwick found that the most common configurationsused by HR departments in large companies to process and obtain informationare various combinations of standalone and networked PCs and dumb terminalslinked to a mainframe/mini.andM;In the 1990 Software Market Survey by Sentry Market Research, Westborough,Mass., 26% of the respondents reported that they use some kind ofmainframe-based HRMS software.andP;  The survey identified the market leaders as:Dun andamp; Bradstreet Software, Atlanta; Integral Systems, Walnut Creek, Calif.;andO;and Information Sciences, Montvale, N.J.andP;  The survey authors said the leadershave been buffeted by an increased user interest in downsizing thisapplication and pressure from users to be more responsive to their changingneeds.andM;PC, MIDRANGE GAINING GROUNDandM;Vendors targeting the PC and midrange environments are beginning to gainground.andP;  For example, Software 2000, Hyannis, Mass., which offers HRMSsoftware for the IBM System/38 and AS/400, recently signed a $6 millioncontract with the British Postal Service.andP;  Under the agreement, the RoyalMail business of the British Post Office will install Software 2000'spersonnel and payroll applications in each of its 64 sites, to automateinformation on over 140,000 employees.andM;The Sentry study also found HRMS to be among the fastest-growing productareas for Digital Equipment Corp. VAX machines.andM;Payroll, personnel and benefits systems are the three main components of acomprehensive HRIS.andP;  However, in many companies, those three components areseparate.andP;  HRSP's Groess said that at 3M, the basic HRIS, record keeping, ismerged with payroll.andP;  &quot;The trend is to merge those two together,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;But from an operating standpoint, that is difficult.&quot;andM;Users and vendors agree that it is also difficult to find a packaged systemthat meets everybody's needs.andM;&quot;We have done a fair amount of customization,&quot; said Diane Dougherty, businessanalyst, International Multifoods, Minneapolis.andP;  International Multifoodsuses the Solution Series from Cyborg.andP;  &quot;No system is built for everybody.andO;Cyborg's code wasn't able to handle nuances of our benefits packages.&quot;andM;Cyborg's Blair concurred that no package will meet everybody's needs, but hesaid the goal is to provide users with the tools they need to make themodifications without changing code.andM;In addition to the initial modifications, an HRIS constantly evolves as thebusiness changes and as government regulations change.andP;  In the aftermath of amerger or acquisition, for example, the HR department faces severalchallenges.andM;&quot;The biggest issue with mergers and acquisitions is getting access to data tobegin analysis, said John Manry, director of marketing management, Comshare,Inc., Ann Arbor, Mich.andP;  Comshare offers the Profiles product line forPC-based human resource functions, and the recently introduced Commander HRMfor DEC VAX and PC platforms.andM;&quot;The difficulty with Mandamp;As is that both companies may have HR systems thatthey're using and that they like.andP;  Everybody tries to hold onto their ownsystem,&quot; said HRSP's Groess.andM;&quot;A company being acquired needs to provide the parent company withinformation on employees.andP;  With a PC-based organization, this is easy,&quot; saidSpectrum's Spoor.andM;PREPARING FOR CHANGEandM;There are ways to prepare the HRIS for change, according to consultantAndrews.andP;  In &quot;HRIS Changes Caused by Mergers, Acquisitions, and LeverageBuy-outs,&quot; [The Review, Summer 1990, a publication of HRSP, Dallas], Andrewsoutlined steps to a smooth conversion.andM;First, she suggests that a firm define which employees are going to beconverted to a different system; ensure that all data is ready for change;and do a detailed requirements analysis of the HRIS.andP;  Once employee data andcodes have been defined, the next step is to review both systems to determinewhich system the data should reside on.andM;After establishing the criteria and selecting the system, Andrews recommendsseveral steps for implementation: develop a conversion plan; develop a testplan; design a parallel plan; provide user and technical training; andprovide user documentation.andM;Barbara Harmon, director of HRIS for Baxter Health Care Corporation,Deerfield, Ill., agrees that there are ways to prepare an HRIS system for amerger or acquisition, but that &quot;it's always hard.&quot;andM;In 1985, Baxter Travenol Laboratories, with 25,000 employees, merged withAmerican Hospital Supply Corporation, with 30,000 employees, to form BaxterHealth Care Corp.andM;After the merger, the company had two HRISs.andP;  Baxter had been using a systemfrom Management Science America (MSA), now owned by Dandamp;B Software; AmericanHospital Supply had been using a system from Tesseract in San Francisco.andM;The newly merged company put a team together to work on the conversionprocess.andP;  Harmon said the biggest issue was uniting the two differentbenefits systems.andM;The goal was to convert everybody to a flexible benefits plan on one system.andO;The company chose Tesseract, and they built a combined database and aninterface from the MSA system to Tesseract.andM;At the end of the conversion, which took three years, the project team turnedto the payroll system.andP;  The company brought in Price Waterhouse to do someteam building, and to take another look at the systems.andP;  The team recommendedconverting everyone to the Tesseract payroll system, but was told bymanagement that it was cost-prohibitive and too time consuming.andM;Today, Baxter still maintains two systems: All payroll is done on the MSAsystem, and all benefits on the Tesseract system.andM;Harmon said the Tesseract system has some drawbacks.andP;  For example, Baxterwrote its own reporting interface because the company found that Tesseract'sinterface was not easy.andM;&quot;Ease of access has not been their [Tesseract's] primary focus,&quot; said Harmon.andO;It's been technical superiority, and that hurt us.andP;  Now they're starting toaddress this.&quot;andM;Baxter uses a 3090 mainframe, with PCs and 3270-compatible terminals linkedby an in-house-developed network.andM;The system is centralized, but Harmon said about 500 users have data access.andO;The divisions can do data inputting and downloading, reporting, and can addsystems on the PC level.andM;&quot;We're trying to do as much processing as we can at the PC level,&quot; Harmonsaid.andP;  Since we've had PCs, the software has been getting easier to use.&quot;andM;REMOVING PC DEPENDENCEandM;At Union Planters Corporation, Memphis, Tenn., Faye Summers, VP, manager ofcompensation and benefits, said the company's move to the SAAvi HRMS, fromInformation Sciences, will remove their dependency on the PC.andP;  &quot;Our sizereally necessitates a mainframe system,&quot; she said.andM;About three years ago, Union Planters began a corporate strategy of acquiringsmall community banks within 150 miles of Memphis.andP;  From mid-1988 to May1990, the parent corporation has acquired 13 subsidiary banks, ranging fromnine to 260 employees per bank.andP;  The entire corporation has 2,734 employees.andM;Since 1984, Union Planters has been using the InSci Database IMS on an Amdahlmainframe.andP;  According to HRS Specialist Holly Walton, payroll was the onlything running on the mainframe; Cobra and flexible benefits were done on aPC, then uploaded to the mainframe.andP;  &quot;We were way ahead of InSci on this,&quot;said Walton.andP;  &quot;Now they've caught up to us.andP;  During flex enrollment times,this is a complex process.andP;  We have to download data, get together with theprogrammer, print thousands of forms on the PC, get the information back andupload again.&quot;andM;&quot;We have a very complex cafeteria plan that is payroll-driven,&quot; said Summers.andO;&quot;It is difficult to administer without payroll.andP;  It has become more importantto have an HRMS to manage programs that will interface with payroll andsalary, tax laws and discrimination testing.&quot;andM;Union Planters is converting to the SAAvi HRMS.andP;  SAAvi combines HRMScapabilities with a set of decision-support tools.andP;  It runs on SAA-compliantplatforms.andM;At Union Planters, HR's biggest role in a merger or acquisition is stillafter the fact, but Mary Ann Camp, senior vice president, director of HR,said she thinks the HR department will get more involved in planning.andM;Today, the HR department is very involved in the &quot;due diligence&quot; process todetermine liabilities and financial stability of the acquired unit.andM;However, Summers said that at one point, management did not include HR in theprocess.andP;  Summers said that an acquisition &quot;may look good to numbercrunchers, but an underfunded pension is a major hit.andP;  [Management] veryquickly recognized the need to have us involved.andP;  Now we're more involvedprior to the final decision.&quot;andM;PLATFORM FLEXIBILITY A PLUSandM;Since 1988, International Multifoods, which processes and distributes foodproducts, has gone through several divestitures and acquisitions.andP;  Thecompany employs over 9,500 people in more than 200 locations worldwide.andM;Recently, a team comprising HR, payroll and IS professionals has been workingto integrate payroll processing and benefits administration acrossInternational Multifoods' nationwide operation.andP;  The company is using TheSolution Series, from Cyborg.andP;  Cyborg products operate on virtually anyhardware platform that supports full Ansi Cobol.andM;International Multifoods has an IBM 4381 mainframe in its newly establisheddata center.andP;  According to Joyce Traver, manager, Pension Administration, thecompany will eventually have remote sites with PCs hooked to IBM AS/400s andnetworked to the mainframe.andM;Traver said that International Multifoods chose Cyborg from among 10 vendors.andO;&quot;It [The Solutions Series] offered flexibility,&quot; Traver said.andP;  &quot;Cyborg likesto say it's 'exceedingly table-driven,' and it is.andP;  It allows users to make alot of the modifications themselves without intervention from the systemsstaff.&quot;andM;Said Business Analyst Diane Dougherty, &quot;Cyborg can run on a variety ofplatforms.andP;  That made it easier to choose them.&quot;andM;The company had previously been using older MSA software and had converted itto run on a Burroughs mainframe.andP;  HR and benefits systems were developedinternally.andM;According to Traver, the HR department is very much involved in the &quot;duediligence&quot; process.andM;&quot;HR is some of the first people there once an acquisition is made.andP;  And weare the last there to explain termination benefits when there's a divesture,&quot;Traver said.andM;She said that bringing acquired firms on the Cyborg system is not a problem.andO;&quot;That is fairly easy to accommodate from a benefits standpoint,&quot; she said.andO;&quot;The acquisition process under the Cyborg system is much easier than underthe prior system.andP;  In terms of a divestiture, we can download certaininformation easily to figure out any liability.&quot;andM;Dougherty said, &quot;Getting everybody on one system is a big topic ofdiscussion.andP;  The Cyborg PC Solution can download the entire system (notpayroll) onto a PC.andP;  This is a real unusual feature from all the packages welooked at.&quot;andM;One drawback, according to Dougherty, is that Cyborg's report writer is noteasy to use.andP;  &quot;Their [Cyborg's] query facility is fine,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;Thereport writer is adequate, but we'd like something more versatile.&quot;andM;INCREASING EMPLOYEE ACCESSandM;Observers agree that easier, faster access to data, and good reporting andquery facilities are the goals of an HRIS.andP;  Another objective, according toHR professionals, is to enable employees to access the system when they havequestions about their benefits plans.andP;  To achieve these goals, many vendorsare enhancing their HR offerings with more advanced technologies, such asvoice response.andP;  With a voice response system, employees can use a touchtonetelephone to access the HRIS and ask questions about their plans.andM;According to Row Henson, director of HR Solutions Marketing for Dandamp;B Software(DBS) in Atlanta, &quot;The trend is for employees to get their own data.&quot;andP;  Shesaid that DBS offers voice response on the E series of HR products (theformer MSA products) through a partnership with Atlanta-based ComputerCommunications Specialists (CCS), and will be making the technology availablefor M series products (formerly McCormack andamp; Dodge) by year-end.andM;Genesys Software Systems, Inc., Methuen, Mass., has a third-party agreementwith Talx Corporation, St. Louis, to make available a voice response systemthat can be integrated with the Genesys series of mainframe-based HRMSs.andM;Cyborg Systems is also moving toward voice response technology and imaging.andO;According to Cyborg's Alan Ross, vice president of business development, thecompany plans to offer users complementary technologies to Cyborg's HRproducts.andM;This month, Cyborg will be announcing business partnerships with TalxCorporation; Digital Design of Jacksonville, Fla., which offers technologyfor laser printing checks; Systems Tax Service, Cypress, Calif., which offersa tax filing service; and Resumix, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif., which offers animaging system based on artificial intelligence that automates the employeerecruitment process.andP;  (See sidebar.)andM;Another direction for the HRIS is to provide a link to an online ExecutiveInformation System (EIS), allowing management to access HR data and getreports without the need to understand how the system works.andM;Peat Marwick's Miller said that few HRISs have an EIS in place, but hepredicts that &quot;the percentage will go up quite a bit.&quot;andM;Comshare's Manry said that EIS is the number two application desired forthose the company has surveyed.andP;  Comshare's Commander HRMS can be integratedwith the company's EIS product, Commander EIS.andM;Dandamp;B Software markets Comshare's EIS under the name SmartView, which isavailable on DBS E series financial products; it will be available on the Mseries later this year, according to DBS's Henson.andP;  By year-end, the companywill define all of its HR systems (both E and M series) to SmartView, Hensonsaid.andM;For the 1990s, HRSP's Groess said HR professionals will look for vendors toprovide them with more enhancements to do their jobs.andP;  According to Groess,this includes HR software available in multidata configurations, the use ofmouse and icons, artificial intelligence, fifth-generation languages andsystem flexibility.andM;Peat Marwick's Miller said that the '90s chief HR officer will need to be a&quot;renaissance man or woman&quot; with skills in business and technology.andM;&quot;In almost all the decisions we make, we have to look at the bottom line,&quot;said Union Planter's Camp.andP;  She said that means looking out for the bestreturn for shareholders, the best interest of the corporation and the bestinterest of the employees.andP;  &quot;It's a real balancing act.&quot;andM;Automating Employee SearchandM;Imaging system creates resume databaseandM;Finding the best employee for a job can be a time-consuming, expensiveprocess.andP;  &quot;We used to have six people standing at copy machines all day,&quot;said Lisa Milligan, Resumix project manager at Sun Microsystems, MountainView, Calif., which receives hundreds of resumes a day.andP;  Now, Sun usessoftware from Resumix, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif., that combines imaging andartificial intelligence (AI) to automate the recruiting process.andP;  (Resumix isa value-added reseller of Sun, DEC and Motorola computers.)andM;The Resumix system uses an optical scanner and an optical character reader toscan resumes into a database.andP;  The system extracts and analyzes theinformation into categories such as work history, skills and experience.andP;  HRrecruiters can view the original resume, as well as do a key word search ofthe database.andM;The software is written in C for a Unix or Ultrix server environment andoperates on Sun workstations and DEC 2100 and 3100 workstations.andP;  Accordingto Steven Leung, Resumix president, a standalone client version runs on DOS,and the software has been ported to the Apple Macintosh.andM;Milligan said the Resumix system increased turnaround time for gettingresumes to recruiters, as well as reduced the manual effort and paperrequired.andP;  However, Milligan said that &quot;artificial intelligence can only beso smart,&quot; and there are occasions when a recruiter is searching for anapplicant with a Stanford University degree, for example, and the softwaredelivers an applicant who lives on Stanford Drive.andM;ATandamp;T, Morristown, N.J, has been using Resumix on Sun workstations since theend of June.andP;  According to Paul Squires, district manager, corporate humanresources, ATandamp;T receives about 200 resumes a day.andP;  Before using Resumix,Squires said the resumes were manually sorted and distributed to recruiters,who were not necessarily sharing resumes.andP;  Now, recruiters have access to theentire database.andM;For example, Squires said that recently ATandamp;T needed to hire salespeople.andO;&quot;Normally, we would be in a panic to come up with resumes because they'd bescattered among recruiters.&quot;andP;  Squires said that with Resumix, they were ableto quickly gather appropriate resumes from the database.andM;Resumix, according to Mike Silvester, vice president of sales and marketing,is finalizing a joint marketing effort this month with Cyborg Systems tointerface Resumix with Cyborg HRIS products.andP;  According to Silvester, Resumixwill be looking for other strategic relationships as well.andM;REPRESENTATIVE HRMS VENDORSandM;For more information about a particular product, circle the correspondingreader service number on the reader service card located at the back of thisissue.andP;
