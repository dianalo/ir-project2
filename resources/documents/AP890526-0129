Environment Program chief saidFriday he expects to have an international treaty to controlclimatic changes ready for signing in three years.   Executive director Mustafa Tolba said the decision to negotiatea treaty with governments as soon as possible was taken at the 15thannual conference of the program's governing council, which endedFriday.   Other resolutions include increasing UNEP's annual budget from$40 million to $100 million by raising member nation's voluntarycontributions by 31 percent in 1990 and 1991.   Delegates from 103 countries, including 44 Cabinet ministers,attended the 12-day conference at UNEP headquarters in Nairobi.   Tolba said delegates were alarmed by ``changing weather patternsand increasing health risks caused by global warming.''   He said his organization would draft the treaty in consultationwith the World Meteorological Organization.   ``We are going to renegotiate the famous Montreal protocol,''Tolba said. ``Its renegotiation will be more difficult thannegotiating it in the first place,'' he said of the non-bindingagreement requiring governments to reduce production ofchlorofluorocarbons, a coolant used in refrigerators and airconditioners that helps deplete the ozone layer.   Scientists say the depletion allows the sun's harmfulultraviolet rays to penetrate the atmosphere and raisestemperatures on earth, which causes the oceans to rise.   Tolba said UNEP will collect scientific data on climatic changesand ``get scientists, at least a majority of them, to speak in onevoice.'' He hoped a scientific report would be ready late nextyear. Then negotiations could begin, Tolba said.   In negotiating the treaty, ``there would be plenty of issues,many stumbling blocks'' he said, because it will affect everynation's industry, agriculture, economy and forestry.</TEXT></DOC>
