In recent      years, in addition to such requirements, there have been requirements for      overcoatability and for solving a problem of formation of stain due to      migration of a low molecular weight silicone oil or plasticizer contained      in the resin such as a silicone resin, which may otherwise fulfill the      above-mentioned requirements. </PAR><PAR>  For example, in the case of sealing materials, there has been a development      from a non-stretchable oily caulking material to an elastic urethane or      polysulfide material. Further, a weather resistant silicone material has      been developed. However, it has a drawback that the staining due to allow      molecular weight silicone oil is substantial. Under the circumstances, a      modified silicone has been developed wherein the backbone structure is a      polyalkylene oxide, and siloxane linkages are present only at the      cross-linked sites. However, there still is a case where the weather      resistance, etc. are inadequate, and such does not provide an adequate      solution. </PAR><PAR>  On the other hand, as a resin curable at room temperature having high      weather resistance, a fluoroolefin-vinylether copolymer has been known,      and it is used for a coating composition. The coating composition made of      such resin is excellent in the weather resistance and serves to increase      the durability of a building stricture, and its usefulness for      industrially application is being recognized. </PAR><PAR>  However, a resin having higher flexibility is desired for application to      sealing materials, elastomers, water-proofing material, adhesives, PCM      coating materials or elastic coating materials which require high      stretchability in addition to the weather resistance as in the present      application. Further, from the viewpoint of practical application, a      composition of one-pack type is desired. </PAR><PAR>  It is an object of the present invention to solve the above-mentioned      problems. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention provides a fluorine-containing copolymer having      fluidity at room temperature and comprising, based on entire polymer      units, from 20 to 70 mol % of polymer units (1) derived from a      polyfluoroolefin and from 1 to 80 mol % of polymer units (2) having a      polyoxtyalkylene chain having, at its terminal, a group selected from the      group consisting of an active hydrogen-containing group, an epoxy group      and a functional group cross-linkable by the action of moisture, the total      of the polymer units (1) and the polymer units (2) being from 30 to 100      mol %. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention also provides a process for producing a      fluorine-containing copolymer, which comprises polymerizing a fluoroolefin      and a monomer having a polyoxyalkylene chain having, at its terminal, a      group selected from the group consisting of an active hydrogen-containing      group, an epoxy group and a functional group cross-linkable by the action      of moisture and an .alpha.,.beta.-unsaturated group copolymerizable with      the fluoroolefin. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention further provides a process for producing a      fluorine-containing copolymer having a polyoxyalkylene chain having a      hydroxyl group at its terminal, which comprises adding an alkylene oxide      to a fluorine-containing copolymer comprising, based on entire polymer      units, from 20 to 70 mol % of polymer units (1) derived from a      fluoroolefin and from 1 to 80 mol % of polymer units (3) having a      functional group to which the alkylene oxide is to be added, the total of      the polymer units (1) and the polymer units (3) being from 30 to 100 mol      %. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention further provides a process for producing a      fluorine-containing copolymer having a functional group cross-linkable by      the action of moisture, which comprises reacting a fluorine-containing      copolymer comprising, based on entire polymer units, from 20 to 70 mol %      of polymer units (1) derived from a fluoroolefin and from 1 to 80 mol % of      polymer units (4) having a polyoxyalkylene chain having a reactive group      at its terminal, the total of the polymer units (1) and the polymer units      (4) being from 30 to 100 mol %, and a compound having a functional group      reactive with the reactive group of the fluorine-containing copolymer and      a functional group cross-linkable by the action of moisture. </PAR><PAR>  Further, the present invention provides a curable composition comprising a      curing agent and a fluorine-containing copolymer having fluidity at room      temperature and comprising, based on entire polymer units, from 20 to 70      mol % of polymer units (1) derived from a fluoroolefin and from 1 to 80      mol % of polymer units (2') having a polyoxyalkylene chain having, at its      terminal group, a group selected from the group consisting of an active      hydrogen-containing group and an epoxy group, the total of the polymer      units (1) and the polymer units (2') being from 30 to 100 mol %. </PAR><PAR>  Still further, the present invention provides a curable composition      containing a fluorine-containing copolymer having fluidity at room      temperature and comprising, based on entire polymer units, from 20 to 70      mol % of polymer units (1) derived from a fluoroolefin and from 1 to 80      mol % of polymer units (2') having a polyoxyalkylene chain having, at its      terminal, a functional group cross-linkable by the action of moisture, the      total of the polymer units (1) and the polymer units (2&quot;) being from 30 to      100 mol %. </PAR><PAR>  Now, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to      the preferred embodiments. </PAR><PAR>  The fluorine-containing copolymer of the present invention contains from 20      to 70 mol % of polymer units (1) derived from a fluoroolefin. The      fluoroolefin is preferably a fluoroolefin having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms,      more preferably from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, such as tetrafluoroethylene,      chlorotrifluoroethylene, trifluoroethylene, vinylidene fluoride, vinyl      fluoride, hexfluoropropylene or pentafluoroethylene. Among them, a      perfluoroolefin is most preferred wherein hydrogen is completely      substituted by halogen. If the polymer units derived from a fluoroolefin      are less than 20 mol %, no adequate weather resistance will be obtained,      and staining tends to be substantial during the use for a long period of      time, such being undesirable. If the amount of the fluoroolefin exceeds 70      mol %, it tends to be difficult to obtain good elasticity or good adhesion      to other materials, such being undesirable. It is particularly preferred      that the copolymer contains from 30 to 70 mol % of the polymer units      derived from a fluoroolefin. </PAR><PAR>  The fluorine-containing copolymer of the present invention further contains      from 1 to 80 mol % of polymer units (2) having a polyoxyalkylene chain      having, at its terminal, a group selected from the group consisting of an      active hydrogen-containing group, an epoxy group and a functional group      cross-linkable by the action of moisture. By virtue of such specific      polymer units (2), the cured product can be an elastomer having excellent      elasticity. Here, the active hydrogen-containing group may be a hydroxyl      group, a carboxylic acid group, an amino group, an acid amide group or a      thiol group. The functional group cross-linkable by the action of moisture      may be an isocyanate group, a hydrolyzable silyl group or a thiol group.      If the proportion of the polymer units (2) is too small, it becomes      difficult to obtain a good elastomer. On the other hand, if the proportion      is too large, the weather resistance or the stain resistance tends to be      low. It is particularly preferred that the copolymer contains from 3 to 30      mol % of the polymer units (2). </PAR><PAR>  The polymer units (2) may be those wherein the polyoxyalkylene chains as      side chains are comprised solely of ether bonds and carbon-carbon bonds,      or those which contain other bonds such as urethane bonds, ester bons or      amino bonds between the main chain and the polyoxyalkylene chain. The      polyoxyalkylene chain may be the one having at least two oxyalkylene      units. If the number of oxyalkylene units is small, it tends to be      difficult to obtain a desired elastomer. The larger the number of the      oxyalkylene units, the better the elasticity of the elastomer. However, if      it is too much, the weather resistance or stain resistance tends to be      low. It is usually preferred that the number of oxyalkylene units is at      most 50, more preferably at most 40. The oxyalkylene units are preferably      oxyalkylene units having from 2 to 8 carbon atoms such as oxyethylene      units, oxypropylene units or oxybutylene units. Such oxyalkylene chain may      be composed of oxyalkylene units of the same type or oxyalkylene units of      a plurality of different types. If oxyalkylene units having a small carbon      number are used alone as the oxyalkylene units, the water resistance tends      to be low. On the other hand, id oxyalkylene units having a large carbon      number are used alone, the oil resistance tends to be low. It is      particularly preferred to employ a polyoxyalkylene chain composed mainly      of oxyalkylene units having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms. The oxyalkylene      units may be those wherein a part of hydrogen bonded to carbon is      substituted by halogen such as fluorine or chlorine, or by an alkyl group      or an aryl group. Further, when the fluorine-containing copolymer of the      present invention is used as a base for an elastic coating material, it is      preferred to employ a polyoxyalkylene chain having at least five      oxyalkylene units. Likewise, when the copolymer is used as a sealant base,      it is preferred to employ a polyoxyalkylene chain having at least ten      oxyalkylene units. </PAR><PAR>  As mentioned above, this polyalkylene chain has, at its terminal, an active      hydrogen-containing group, an epoxy group or a functional group      cross-linkable by the action of moisture. Such an active      hydrogen-containing group, an epoxy group or a functional group      cross-linkable by the action of moisture, may be bonded directly to the      terminal of the polyoxyalkylene chain, or may be bonded via other bond      such as a urethane bond or an ester bond. </PAR><PAR>  The fluorine-containing copolymer of the present invention may further      contain other polymer units in addition to the above-described polymer      units (1) and (2). In such a case, the total of the polymer units (1) and      the polymer units (2) is from 30 to 100 mol % based on the entire polymer      units. If the proportion of the polymer units (1) and (2) is too small, no      adequate weather resistance, stain resistance and elasticity can be      obtained. Here, other polymer units may be polymer units derived from a      monomer copolymerizable with the fluoroolefin. The monomer copolymerizable      with the fluoroolefin, may be an ethylenically unsaturated compound such      as a vinyl compound, an allyl compound, an acryloyl compound or a      methacryloyl compound. When polymer units other than the polymer units (1)      and (2) are contained, a larger amount of polymer units will be contained      among the polymer units (2), whereby the elasticity will be obtained more      effectively. </PAR><PAR>  The fluorine-containing copolymer of the present invention has fluidity at      room temperature. Specifically, it preferably has fluidity at a level such      that it is deformable by its own weight at 25.degree. C. More      specifically, it preferably has a viscosity of at most 100,000 centipoise      (hereinafter referred to simply as cp) at 25.degree. C. A      fluorine-containing copolymer having a viscosity being too high is      undesirable since the practical applicability is thereby extremely low in      its application to e.g. a sealant. A copolymer having a viscosity of at      most 20,000 cp at 25.degree. C. is particularly preferred, since it      provides excellent practical applicability even when used without any      solvent. There is no particular limitation to the lower limit of the      viscosity. However, it is usual to employ a fluorine-containing copolymer      having at least 300 cp at 25.degree. C. </PAR><PAR>  The fluorine-containing copolymer of the present invention can be prepared      by e.g. the following processes. </PAR><PAR>  Firstly, there may be mentioned a process which comprises polymerizing a      fluoroolefin and a monomer having a polyoxyalkylene chain having, at its      terminal, a group selected from the group consisting of an active      hydrogen-containing group, an epoxy group and a functional group      cross-linkable by the action of moisture, and an      .alpha.,.beta.-unsaturated group copolymerizable with the fluoroolefin. </PAR><PAR>  Secondly, there may be mentioned a process which comprises      addition-reacting an alkylene oxide to a fluorine-containing copolymer      (hereinafter referred to as a fluorine-containing copolymer X) comprising,      based on entire polymer units, from 20 to 70 mol % of polymer units      derived from a fluoroolefin and from 1 to 80 mol % of polymer units (3)      having a functional group to which an alkylene oxide is to be added, the      total of the polymer units (1) and the polymer units (3) being from 30 to      100 mol %. </PAR><PAR>  Thirdly, there may be mentioned a process which comprises reacting a      fluorine-containing copolymer (hereinafter referred to as a      fluorine-containing copolymer Y) comprising, based on entire polymer      units, from 20 to 70 mol % of polymer units (1) derived from a      fluoroolefin and from 1 to 80 mol % of polymer units (4) having a      polyoxyalkylene chain having a reactive group at its terminal, the total      of the polymer units (1) and the polymer units (4) being from 30 to 100      mol % with a compound having a functional group reactive with the reactive      group of the fluorine-containing copolymer Y and a functional group      cross-linkable by the action of moisture. </PAR><PAR>  In the first process, the monomer having a polyoxyalkylene chain having at      its terminal, an active hydrogen-containing group, an epoxy group or a      functional group cross-linkable by the action of moisture and an      .alpha.,.beta.-unsaturated group copolymerizable with the fluoroolefin,      may preferably be a monomer having an .alpha.,.beta.-unsaturated group,      such as a vinyl group, an allyl group, an acryloyl group or a methacryloyl      group. Such a monomer may be prepared by a method which comprises      addition-reacting an alkylene oxide to a hydroxyl group-containing monomer      such as a hydroxyalkylene ether, a hydroxyalkylallyl ether, a reaction      product of acrylic acid with a polyhydric alcohol, a reaction product of      glycidylallyl ether with an alkanol amine or a phenol compound or allyl      alcohol, or a method which comprises reacting a monomer having a reactive      group such as a hydroxyl group, an alkoxysilyl group, an epoxy group or an      amino group with a polyoxyalkylene compound having a group reactive with      the above reactive group, such as an isocyanate group, an alkoxysilyl      group or a carboxylic acid group. Further, it may be obtained by a method      which comprises reacting to the monomer obtained by such a method, a      compound having a functional group curable by the action of moisture, such      as a diisocyanate compound, an isocyanate alkylsilane compound, a      silylisocyanate compound or a mercaptoalkanoic acid. In this first      process, if only one type of the fluoroolefin and only one type of the      monomer having a polyoxyalkylene chain are polymerized, it is highly      likely that they undergo alternating copolymerization. Particularly when      the monomer having a polyoxyalkylene chain is a vinyl compound or an allyl      compound, this possibility is extremely high. In the case of alternating      copolymerization, other polymerization units present between polymer units      (2) will be as little as only about one, whereby the resulting polymer      tends to hardly have good flexibility or elasticity. It is preferred to      employ at least two different kinds of compounds for either one or both of      the fluoroolefin and the monomer having a polyoxyalkylene chain.      Otherwise, in addition to the fluoroolefin and the monomer having a      polyoxyalkylene chain, other comonomer copolyermizable therewith, may be      copolymerized so that a number of such other polymer units will be present      among the polymer units (2) in the resulting polymer. Usually, the latter      method of copolymerizing a comonomer is employed. Here, the commoner may      be a compound having a pulverizable site such as a vinyl group, an allyl      group, an acryloyl group or a methacryloyl group. Specifically, olefins,      vinyl ethers, vinyl esters, allyl ethers, allyl esters, acrylic acid      esters and methacrylic acid esters may be mentioned. Particularly      preferred is a compound having a linear, branched or alicyclic alkyl group      having from 1 to 15 carbon atoms. Such a commoner may be the one wherein a      part or all of hydrogen bonded to carbon is substituted by fluorine. In      this first process, the proportion of the polymer units (1) is from 20 to      70 mol %, and the proportion of the polymer units (2) is from 1 to 80 mol      %, and the total of the polymer units (1) and the polymer units (2) is      preferably at least 30 mol %, based on the entire polymer units. Such      polymerization may be conducted by any one of solution polymerization,      emulsion polymerization, suspension polymerization and bulk      polymerization. A polymerization initiator or a polymerization initiating      source such as ionizing radiation is applied to the predetermined amounts      of monomers to conduct the polymerization. Various other conditions may be      similar to those commonly employed for solution polymerization, emulsion      polymerization, suspension polymerization or bulk polymerization. </PAR><PAR>  In the second process, the fluorine-containing copolymer X can be prepared      by copolymerizing a fluoroolefin, a monomer having a functional group to      which an alkylene oxide can be added or a group convertible to such a      functional group, and if necessary, other comonomer. Here, a hydroxyl      group or a carboxyl group is a typical example for the functional group to      which an alkylene oxide can be added. Here, the monomer having such a      functional group or a group convertible to such a functional group,      includes a hydroxyalkyl vinyl ether, a hydroxyalkyl allyl ether, a      hydroxyalkyl vinyl ester, a hydroxylakyl allyl ester, a glycidyl vinyl      ether, a glycidyl allyl ether, an aminoalkyl vinyl ether, an aminoalkyl      allyl ether, an aminoalkyl vinyl ester, an aminoalkyl allyl ether, acrylic      acid, methacrylic acid and allyl vinyl ether. As the group convertible to      the functional group to which an alkylene oxide can be added, an ester      group hydrolyzable after the polymerization, may be mentioned. Further, if      necessary, it may be converted to other functional group to which an      alkylene oxide can be added, after polymerization. For example, there may      be mentioned a method wherein a polybasic carboxylic acid or its anhydride      is added to a hydroxyl group to convert it to a carboxylic acid group, or      a method wherein an alkanol amine or a phenol compound is reacted to an      epoxy group to convert it to a hydroxyl group. In the preparation of the      fluorine-containing copolymer X, a monomer similar to the comonomer      described with respect to the above first process, may be copolymerized.      In this case, it is preferred to control the polymerization so that the      proportion of the polymer units (1) will be from 20 to 70 mol %, the      proportion of the polymer units (3) will be from 1 to 80 mol %, and the      total of the polymer units (1) and the polymer units (3) will be from 30      to 100 mol %, based on the entire polymer units of the copolymer. For the      polymerization, a method of polymerization similar to the one described      with respect to the first process, may be employed. The addition of an      alkylene oxide to the fluorine-containing copolymer X thus prepared, can      be conducted in the same manner as the production of a usual polyether      compound. </PAR><PAR>  In the third process, the fluorine-containing copolymer Y can be prepared      by the following methods. </PAR><PAR>  Firstly, there may be mentioned a method which comprises polymerizing a      fluoroolefin and a monomer copolymerizable with a fluoroolefin and having      a polyoxyalkylene chain having a reactive group at the terminal. </PAR><PAR>  Secondary, there may be mentioned a method which comprises reacting a      fluorine-containing copolymer Y' comprising from 20 to 70 mol % of polymer      units (1) derived from a fluoroolefin and from 10 to 80 mol % of polymer      units (5) having a reactive group, the total of the polymer units (1) and      the polymer units (5) being at least 30 mol %, based on entire polymer      units, and a polyoxyalkylene compound having a group reactive with the      reactive group of the fluorine-containing copolymer Y'. </PAR><PAR>  Thirdly, there may be mentioned a method which comprises addition-reacting      an alkylene oxide to the fluorine-containing copolymer Y&quot; comprising from      20 to 70  mol % of polymer units (1) derived from a fluoroolefin and from      1 to 80 mol % of polymer units (6) having a hydroxyl group, the total of      the polymer units (1) and the polymer units (6) being at least 30 mol %,      based on entire polymer units. </PAR><PAR>  The first method may be conducted in the same manner as described with      respect to the above first process. </PAR><PAR>  The fluorine copolymer Y' in the second method can be prepared in      accordance with the method for the production of the fluorine-containing      copolymer X in the above-mentioned second process. Further, the      polyoxyalkylene compound capable of reacting with the fluorine-containing      copolymer Y', can be prepared by a method which comprises reacting a      compound such as an alkanol amine, a polyvalent isocyanate compound, an      isocyanate alkyl acrylate, a silyl isocyanate or a polybasic carboxylic      anhydride to a polyoxyalkylene having an alkylene oxide added in      accordance with a usual method, or a method which comprises adding an      alkylene oxide by a usual method to a compound such as a hydroxyalkyl      vinyl ether. </PAR><PAR>  The third method may be conducted in the same manner as the second process      descried above. </PAR><PAR>  In the third method, the reactive group in the fluoride-containing      copolymer Y may be a hydroxyl group, a carboxylic acid, group, an amino      group, an acid amide group, a thiol group, an active halogen-containing      group, an epoxy group or an ethylenically unsaturated group. The compound      having a functional group cross-linkable by the action of moisture, to be      reacted to the fluorine-containing copolymer Y includes, for example, a      polyvalent isocyanate compound such as hexamethylene diisocyanate or      toluene diisocyanate, an isocyanate alkylsilane compound such as      .gamma.-isocyanate proplymethyldimethoxysilane, a silylisocyanate compound      such as trimethoxysilyl isocyanate, a hydrolyzable silyl group-containing      compound such as 4-trimethoxysilyltetrahydropthalic anhydride, or a thiol      group-containing compound such as a mercapto alkanoic acid or a      thiodialkanoic acid. The reaction of the fluorine-containing copolymer Y      and the above compound, is preferably conduced by reacting an excess      equivalent of the above-mentioned compound to the reactive group in the      fluorine-containing copolymer Y. If the amount of the above compound to be      reacted is small, gellation is likely to result, such being undesirable.      It is particularly preferred to react at least one mol of the above      identified compound per mol of the reactive group in the      fluorine-containing copolymer Y. </PAR><PAR>  The fluorine-containing copolymer of the present invention is suitable for      use as a base for e.g. a sealant or an elastic coating material. </PAR><PAR>  Among the fluorine-containing copolymers of the present invention, one      having an active hydrogen-containing group or an epoxy group at the      terminal of the polyoxyalkylene chain (hereinafter referred to as a      fluorine-containing copolymer (a)) ma be combined with a curing agent to      obtain a curable composition (hereinafter referred to as a composition      (a)). Likewise, among the fluorine-containing copolymers of the present      invention, one having a functional group cross-linkable by the action of      moisture at the terminal of the polyoxyalkylene chain (hereinafter      referred to as a fluorine-containing copolymer (b)) makes a curable      composition (hereinafter referred to as a composition (b)) even without      incorporating a curing agent. Hereinafter, the composition (a) and the      composition (b) are generally referred to simply as a composition.      Further, the curable composition (b) may contain a curing agent. </PAR><PAR>  As the curing agent for the composition (a), a compound may be employed      which is capable of reacting with the active hydrogen-containing group or      the epoxy group of the fluorine-containing copolymer (a) to form a      cross-linkage. For example, a polyvalent isocyanate compound, an      aminoplasto compound or a polyvalent amino compound may be mentioned.      Among them, a polyol-modified polyisocyanate compound is preferred, since      it presents a cured product having excellent elasticity. When a polyvalent      isocyanate compound is used as the curing agent, curing can be conducted      with moisture, and the practical applicability is excellent. In this case,      from the viewpoint of the reactivity with an isocyanate group, it is      particularly preferred to employ as the fluorine-containing copolymer (a)      a copolymer having an active hydrogen-containing group, particularly, a      hydroxyl group. </PAR><PAR>  To the composition of the present invention, additives such as a filler, a      curing catalyst, a solvent, a photo stabilizer, an ultraviolet absorber, a      heat stabilizer, a leveling agent, a defoaming or a foam suppressing      agent, may be incorporated, as the case requires. </PAR><PAR>  The filler includes reinforcing fillers such as fumed silica, precipitated      silica, silicic anhydride, hydrous silicic acid and carbon black, fillers      such as calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, diatomaceous earth,      calcined clay;, clay, talc, surface-treated aluminum hydroxide, magnesium      hydroxide, titanium oxide, bentonite, organic bentonite, ferric oxide,      zinc oxide, active zinc white, hydrogenated castro oil and silica      balloons; and fibrous fillers such as asbestos, glass fibers and glass      filaments. The filler may be incorporated in an amount of from 1 to 500      parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the fluorine-containing      copolymer. </PAR><PAR>  When a curable composition having a high strength is desired to be produced      with such a filler, a good result can be obtained by using a filler      selected from the group consisting of fumed silica, precipitated silica,      silicic anhydride, hydrous silicic acid, carbon black, surface-treated      fine calcium carbonate, calcined clay, clay and active zinc white in an      amount of from 1 to 100 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the      fluorine-containing copolymer. When a curable composition having good      elongation with low strength is desired to be produced, a good result can      be obtained by using a filler selected from the group consisting of      titanium oxide, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, talc, ferric      oxide, zinc oxide and silica balloons in an amount of from 5 to 200 parts      by weight per 100 parts by weight of the fluorine-containing copolymer.      These fillers may, of course, be employed alone or in combination as a      mixture of two or more different kinds. </PAR><PAR>  Now, the present invention will be described with reference to Examples.

Then, dissolved air was removed by means of liquid nitrogen.      Then, 51 g of chlorotrifluoroethylene was introduced. The temperature was      gradually raised and then maintained at 65.degree. C., and the      polymerization reaction was continued under stirring for 10 hours. The      reactor was cooled with water to terminate the polymerization. Then, the      reactor was cooled to room temperature, unreacted monomers were withdrawn,      and the reactor was opened. The polymer solution was filtered, and then      the solvent was removed by an evaporator to obtain a fluorine-containing      copolymer. The obtained fluorine-containing copolymer had a number average      molecular weight of 6,500, a glass transition temperature of -68.degree.      C. and a viscosity of 9,000 cp at  25.degree. C. In the molecular weight      measurement, (by means of G.P.C.). of this fluorine-containing copolymer,      no substantial peak corresponding to the vinyl ether obtained in      Preparation Example 5 was observed. This indicates that the vinyl ether      having the polyoxyalkylene chain was copolymerized. </PAR><PAC>  TEST EXAMPLES </PAC><PAR>  To 100 g of each of the fluorine-containing copolymers obtained in Examples      8 to 17 and Comparative Examples 3 to 6, the curing catalyst, titanium      oxide and calcium carbonate were added as identified in Table 4, and the      mixture was coated in a thickness of 2 m on a stainless steel plate and      left to stand at 20.degree.
