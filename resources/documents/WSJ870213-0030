The dollar's stronger performance against most major currencies, weaker oil prices throughout most of the day and technical factors triggered the losses, traders and anaylsts said.    &quot;It was a triple play,&quot; said William O'Neill, research director of Elders Futures Inc., New York.    Dennis Suskind, partner in charge of metals at J. Aron andamp; Co., New York, said &quot;there was nothing but selling&quot; near the session's close. &quot;There weren't many investors prepared to come in and buy,&quot; he said. Bullion demand remains soft, traders said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold contracts for February delivery fell $7.10 an ounce to $395.30. March silver contracts skidded 8.5 cents to $5.46 an ounce. Platinum futures prices for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange plunged $15 an ounce to $506.70.    Gold prices in the past five sessions had declined gradually, but until yesterday they hadn't breached the psychologically important level of $400 an ounce. Yesterday's sharp drop below that point surprised some traders, who said today's trading will indicate the market's near-term direction. &quot;If there are two closes under $400, the down move will be more signficant,&quot; a New York trader said.    J. Aron's Mr. Suskind predicted that if gold prices don't soon rebound, they will fall to as low as $375 an ounce &quot;in short order.&quot;    In other futures markets yesterday:    ENERGY: Crude oil for immediate delivery skidded below $18 a barrel for the first time since early January. But other futures contracts rebounded to notch gains following early losses. The &quot;volatility is back,&quot; a New York trader said. Continued speculation about marginal overproduction by some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries led to &quot;a lack of confidence in the market,&quot; said John Hill, a vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures Inc. in New York. &quot;The big question now is whether the overproduction will continue,&quot; said Ian Gibson, a vice president at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities Inc. in New York. Kleinwort Grieveson estimated that OPEC produced as much as 16.8 million barrels a day in the first week of February, compared with a December quota of 15.8 million barrels. If this level is maintained, the fundamentals will drag crude oil prices to $16 a barrel in the coming weeks, Mr. Gibson said. But as yesterday's session wore on, prices reversed course. &quot;Prices had more bounce than Mary Lou Retton,&quot; Mr. Hill said. Strong refiner buying at the day's lows prompted the turnaround, traders said. Meanwhile, some analysts discounted the effects of the cartel's reported overproduction. &quot;There has been some, but it won't have much bearing on prices,&quot; said Peter Cardillo, futures trading adviser at Josephthal andamp; Co. in New York.    COFFEE: Futures traded within a steady range and closed slightly higher despite a very large U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of the next Brazilian coffee crop. The contract for March delivery ended 0.38 of a cent higher at $1.2376 a pound. After the close of trading Wednesday, the USDA said it estimated Brazil's late spring and summer harvest will yield 33 million bags, far more than double the 1986-87 output of 13.9 million bags. A bag weighs 132 pounds. Ideal growing weather that has prevailed in Brazilian coffee-growing areas in recent weeks is considered a major factor favoring a large crop. The estimate was based on examination of plantations by the USDA's attache in Brazil, the department said. Trading reaction to the report has yet to arrive in full, it is believed, because many market participants hadn't returned yesterday from a four-day annual coffee convention in Florida. In any event, market players currently are focusing on whether the International Coffee Organization, whose full council is set to meet Feb.23-27, will reimpose export quotas on producing countries, said Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. The ICO decision is seen affecting trading in the near term far more than the Brazilian crop forecast.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Pork belly futures continued their slide as contracts for February, March and May delivery fell the daily limit of two cents a pound. Traders have been liquidating holdings in compliance with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's decision to reduce its limit on February contract positions. Traders may hold only 25 contracts or less at session's close today. The pressure in the pork belly pit helped drive hog futures lower. Cattle futures also closed lower as that market was depressed by weak cash prices and huge open interest in the April and June contracts.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Corn futures hit life of contract lows for the second day in a row. Factors in the decline, analysts said, included technical and commercial selling, traders' expectations of increased farmer selling and farmers' use of generic certificates. Meanwhile, good weather in South America continued to cast a bearish shadow on soybean futures, anaylsts said, as soybeans, oil and meal all finished lower.    COCOA: Futures declined on reports of rains in Brazil's major cocoa growing area of Bahia and substantial sales by big African producers. The March contract fell $30 to $1,805 a metric ton. Reports of the rains prompted the selling, analysts said, although one cautioned that the rains covered just 30% of the Bahia area. The weather report seemed to alleviate some concern about lack of rain and attention again was turning to world-wide oversupply of cocoa, another analyst said. Sales by the Ivory Coast and Ghana of substantial quantities of beans for near-term and deferred shipment also contributed to futures selling, an analyst said. &quot;It's a traditional pattern of (producers) selling on advances that stops (futures price) rallies in their tracks every time,&quot; the analyst said. He also said the oversupply, which is depressing futures prices toward life of contract lows, &quot;isn't something that's going to clear up overnight.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
