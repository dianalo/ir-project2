Morris Jr.andP;  set loose a worm in Nov 1988 that paralyzed6,000 computers on the Milnet, Internet and ARPAnet networks.andP;  Ajury found him guilty under the federal Computer Fraud and AbuseAct of 1986.andP;  He could have been fined up to $250,000 and spent asmany as five years in jail for his crime, but US District JudgeHoward Munson has sentenced him instead to 400 hours of communityservice, a $10,000 fine and three years probation.andP;  This sentencedoes not serve the threefold purpose which the punishment phase ofa felony trial should: it provides no remedy, no deterrence toMorris or others, and little rehabilitation of Morris.andP;  Themessage sent to other hackers by the light punishment is that evenserious attacks on computer systems will not be treated seriouslyby the judicial system.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Computer CrimesComputer hackersComputer viruses.andO;Person:    Morris, Robert T., Jr. (cases); Munson, Howard (cases).andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>I don't normally second-guess the results of the American judicial system.andO;In the worst American tradition of letting someone else worry about things,I'm inclined to sit back and assume that the wheels of justice turn with somemeasure of, well, justice.andM;But the sentence handed down recently in the trial of Cornell hacker RobertMorris really burns me up.andP;  It was offensive, an insult to the justice systemand to those of us who respect the law and believe in that system.andM;It also sent exactly the wrong signal to others who continue to play thedangerous game Morris admitted in court that he'd undertaken.andM;This was a landmark case, the first prosecution under the federal ComputerFraud and Abuse Act of 1986.andP;  The jury found Morris guilty.andP;  Then TheHonorable Howard Munson, U.S.andP;  District Judge in Syracuse, N.Y., weighed inwith a sentence of three years' probation, a $10,000 fine and 400 hours ofcommunity service.andM;But no jail time -- none whatsoever -- for one of the largest, most visibleand most disruptive attacks yet on a large-scale computer network.andM;As the Associated Press noted in its report on the sentencing, a happy Morrishugged his mother, shook hands with his father, then immediately left thecourthouse.andP;  He should have been happy: He'd been facing up to five years inprison and $250,000 in fines.andM;Instead, he was levied a trivial fine, one day a week for a year of communityservice, and three years of probation.andP;  Big deal.andM;That kind of slap on the wrist tells other hackers that while they may getbad publicity, they're not going to get seriously punished, even for seriousattacks on major systems.andM;Morris, of course, claimed at his trial that his motives were pure, even ifhis results were foul: He never meant to let that worm escape, never intendedto bring 6,000 ARPAnet, Internet and Milnet workstations to a halt back inNovember 1988.andM;But actions and results, not motives, are the proper test here.andP;  Morris' juryunderstood that: It found him guilty.andM;Now Judge Munson has undercut that jury's wisdom by treating Morris' felonyas something like a college prank gone wrong.andM;Corporate and institutional MIS people may not exactly live in fear of wormattacks such as the one Morris launched, but they do worry about them everyday.andP;  Moreover, they are forced to devote very significant resources todetecting, tracing, stopping or mitigating and cleaning up after worms suchas his.andM;Those resources cost a great deal and must inevitably be stolen from thelarger job, the MIS group's mission.andM;By his actions, Morris has encouraged similar attacks by others.andP;  And bymerely slapping Morris' wrist, the judge now shares the blame for thosecoming attacks.andM;The punishment phase of felony trials is supposed to provide remedy,rehabilitation and deterrence.andP;  No remedy was possible in Morris' case,little rehabilitation will come from his casual sentence, and the judge threwaway deterrence.andM;Robert Morris, 1; the American judicial system, 0.andP;  Nice job, Judge.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
