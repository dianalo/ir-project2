Media General said thatamong the Big Board stocks on its list, 1,272 were up, with 165 down and 22unchanged.;    The over-the-counter market also did well, with 1,400 stockshigher at the end of the quarter, 259 lower and 64 unchanged.;    Theperformance of issues on the American Stock Exchange was similar. MediaGeneral said 357 issues on the Amex rose, while 56 issues fell and 9 wereunchanged.;    But, unlike many winners of the last decade, the push in stockprices had more to do with the fundamentals of each company than withpotential takeovers.;    &quot;The most pleasant aspect of the market's performanceis that companies once again are being valued on their worth as performers, asoperating companies, rather than on their vulnerability to a leveraged buyoutor a takeover,&quot; said Jack A. Sullivan, a principal with Van Kasper andamp; Co., aSan Francisco-based investment bank and brokerage.;    &quot;Good companyperformances are being rewarded no matter what the sector, and that is a verypleasant and healthy sign. At the same time, bad performances are beingpunished, and that also is a healthy sign,&quot; Sullivan said.;    Several trendsemerged. A number of companies benefited either directly from business fromthe gulf war or from perceptions that they would get business because of theconflict.;    Another trend was the rapid growth in companies involved inhealth-care.;    The top five performers on the American Stock Exchange werecompanies that are involved in health care. That reflected the generallyfrothy trading in health-care issues. While there were only 28 initial publicofferings in the quarter, five, totaling $112.9 million, were for health-careconcerns, according to Securities Data Co.;    The big winner on the New YorkStock Exchange was a retail company that survived the takeover battles of the1980s. Venture Stores, once a division of May Department Stores Co., operatesmore than 75 retail discount stores in the Midwest. The company has benefitedfrom a trend toward discount stores, and its sales increased 10 percent inFebruary compared with February 1990.;    Despite the company's strongfundamentals, much of the gain came in a flurry of trading last week. Companyofficials said they had no corporate news to account for the advance.;    Onewinner from the Persian Gulf war was Martech USA Inc., which provides a rangeof environmental cleanup services. The company, based in Anchorage, is knownfor its oil-spill response services.;    After the huge spill in the PersianGulf, speculation swept the marketplace that the company could get contractsfor cleanup work. The predictions proved correct.;    The biggest loser on theBig Board was Laidlaw Inc., a solid-waste services company that was hit by aflurry of bad news in the quarter. In March, company executives said thatearnings for the second quarter would likely decline by more than 50 percentfrom the 1990 period, partly because of a slowing economy.;    But Laidlaw,based in Burlington, Ontario, had other serious problems. Its waste-managementsubsidiary was accused of uncompetitive business practices by the Canadiangovernment. Canada's Bureau of Competition Policy said the contracts inquestion were unenforceable.;    At the same time, Donald Jackson, presidentof Laidlaw, was reported to be facing civil charges of breach of trust. TrimacLtd., based in Calgary, Alberta, was said to be suing Jackson for $20 million(Canadian), or $17.2 million (American), for his handling of the sale ofTrimac's waste-management subsidiary to Laidlaw in 1986.;    At the AmericanStock Exchange, the biggest winner for the quarter was Medco Research Inc., aLos Angeles-based drug research and development company. Medco, which moved tothe Amex from the over-the-counter market during the quarter, introduced adrug that it hopes will be used to replace cardiac treadmill tests for someheart patients, Medco also expects its first European sales this fall.;    Infilings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company showed thatthe rise in price occurred even as two corporate insiders were selling acombined total of more than 70,000 shares in the company.;    Also, at thebeginning of the quarter, the company reported that the SEC was conducting aninformal fact-finding inquiry into the trading of Medco's stock on theover-the-counter market.;    In the filing, Medco said it had also asked theSEC to investigate the activities of short sellers of the company's stock.Short sellers sell borrowed stock in anticipation of buying back an equalnumber of shares later at a lower price, thus making a profit. The filing didnot elaborate on either inquiry.;    The American exchange's biggest loser wasWinthrop Insured Mortgage Investors II, a limited partnership, which agreedduring the quarter to sell all of its remaining assets. The assets, sixfederally insured mortgages, were purchased from the partnership by FirstBoston Corp. The sale will result in a distribution of cash to shareholders,and the fund will be terminated.;    On the over-the-counter market, thebiggest winner was again a company in the health-care industry. InterpharmLaboratories Ltd. is an Israeli company that develops and producesbiotechnology products for the health-care industry. The company showed strongearnings at the end of last year, compared with a loss in 1989.;    The strongperformance was spurred by penetration for its products in Italy. Also, theuse of a new growth hormone manufactured by Interpharm, which is used inchildren with hormonal deficiencies, has soared in recent months.;    Perhapsthe biggest mystery of the quarter involved a company that was one of thebiggest losers on the over-the-counter market. Yandamp;A Group, a St. Louis-basedengineering concern specializing in electric utilities, saw its stock tumblewhen its president and chief executive, Malcolm Cheek, disappeared.;    Thedisappearance in March, which prompted an inquiry by the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation, came three days before the company disclosed that it expectedto have a loss of $7 million for 1990, including $1 million of non-recurringcosts and up to $4 million of write-offs. The company had been profitable in1989.;    The news at Yandamp;A came after the company decided in October to dismissDeloitte andamp; Touche as its independent accounting firm. In December, the firmhired KPMG Peat Marwick as its auditor.; THE MARKETS; In trading    today:;...; The Dow Jones index fell 23.27 points by 2  p.m. EST.; ...; May crude oilfell 3 cents a barrel to $19.60.; ...; The dollar closed at 140.60 yen, up0.05 yen.; ...; European gold markets were closed today.;.....................................................; QUARTERLY BIG BOARDGAINERS AND LOSERS; Common stocks that showed the largest percentage gainsand; declines in the first quarter, as calculated by Media General; FinancialServices.
