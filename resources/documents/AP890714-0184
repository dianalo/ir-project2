The Fernald plant, where production was suspended earlier thisweek, also is the target of a special investigation by a DOE teamassessing health and safety measures and other aspects of theplant's operation.   ``Fernald's been at the top of our list for some time,'' saidDeputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore. ``We're going in there to seewhat's wrong and what might need to be done to get into compliance.''   FBI spokesman Edwin Boldt said from Cincinnati that theinvestigation was triggered by an allegation of criminal wrongdoingin contracting. He gave no details.   The Fernald complex, about 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati, is akey contributor to U.S. nuclear weapons production. It processesuranium compounds, produces uranium billets for nuclear weaponsproduction and makes uranium target elements for defense nuclearreactors.   It's also one of the government's most seriously contaminatedfacilities.   The Environmental Protection Agency this week proposed addingFernald to the Superfund list of high-priority cleanup sites. TheEPA has executed a compliance agreement outlining a schedule fordealing with contaminated silos, waste pits and barrels _ a jobestimated to cost $1 billion to $1.5 billion.   Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio, the plant operator, saidproduction was suspended to focus more work on clean-up.   ``We're going to use all our people and concentrate on wastemanagement until I'm satisfied we're on the right track and onschedule,'' said company president Bruce Boswell.   Moore said the contractor's decision was prompted by a DOEappraisal that pointed out weaknesses in plant maintenace andproduction-related training.   ``They did the right thing: Get the people properly trained,'' hesaid. ``We envision they'll be back up in two to three weeks.''   However, Westinghouse spokesman Pete Kelley said ``it will be alot longer than that'' before production can resume.   Fernald was given a production quota of about 1,000 metric tonsfor the current year, which ends Sept. 30. Kelley said the complexhad produced about 593 metric tons as of June.</TEXT></DOC>
