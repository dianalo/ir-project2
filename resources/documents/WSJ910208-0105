Lawrence Walshhas turned the Iran-Contra case into life tenure. Now comesword from the federal court created to handle specialprosecutor cases that the target of a prosecutor'sinvestigations can get an indictment declared invalid, yetstill end up out $1 million to pay for a legal defense thathe never should have had to make.   Former White House aide Lyn Nofziger was precisely thekind of partisan target Congress must have had in mind forspecial prosecutors, who pursue high-ranking executive-branchofficials (Congress exempted itself). Independent CounselJames McKay indicted Mr. Nofziger, a former political adviserto President Reagan, for allegedly violating the law barringformer executive-branch officials from lobbying their formercolleagues within a year of leaving office (Congress alsoexempted itself from this law).</LP><TEXT>   Federal appeals judges threw out the Nofziger convictionbecause in his zeal, independent counsel McKay forgot thatproving a crime means proving that the defendant &quot;knowingly&quot;violated the law. If Mr. Nofziger was a criminal, then theoverly vague ethics law would &quot;criminalize a broad range ofapparently innocent behavior,&quot; Judge James Buckley wrote in1989. The case was dismissed, the Supreme Court refused Mr.McKay's appeal and we had another case showing thatprosecutors &quot;independent&quot; of Justice Department oversight area threat to their targets' legal rights.   Mr. Nofziger then asked for full vindication by gettinghis legal fees of some $1 million paid; Mr. McKay's sidespent $2.4 million in his failed prosecution. Since the lawmade executive-branch officials easy targets for unsupervisedindependent counsel, Congress said that taxpayers shouldreimburse legal fees for targets who are investigated butnever indicted. The special independent-counsel court thisweek acknowledged that the appeals court's reversal meant theindictment was never valid, but said Mr. Nofziger stillcouldn't receive money to pay his lawyers.   The court cited a provision in the law that legal feesshould be reimbursed if they &quot;would not have been incurredbut for&quot; the existence of an independent counsel. Acongressional report said the idea was to make sure that&quot;covered officials will not be subject to a more rigorousapplication of the criminal law&quot; than people not covered byindependent counsel. Yet as Mr. Nofziger noted, he wassubject to a &quot;task force&quot; of prosecutors &quot;not limited bybudgetary or manpower considerations.&quot; Still, the courtsomehow concluded that Mr. Nofziger might have endured $1million in legal costs even if there hadn't been anindependent counsel. This despite the unsurprising fact thatthe Justice Department has never prosecuted anyone for Mr.Nofziger's non-crime.   This opinion can be appealed, but its most troublingaspect may be the spectacle of the special federal courtcreated to adjudicate independent-counsel cases going out ofits way to protect independent counsel who have abused theirpower. Despite this failed prosecution, the special courtheaded by Judge George MacKinnon somehow could conclude thatMr. Nofziger &quot;has shown no grounds for complaint.&quot;   As Messrs. Walsh, McKay and others have shown, the idea of&quot;independent&quot; prosecutors is simply not working out. There isa long record showing that these prosecutors are prone tocommit legal abuses. Too often what we have had to witness isa system of special injustice.</TEXT></DOC>
