Day, whose trademarks were the line ``Gee, Mr. Benny'' and skitsin which he tricked the comedian into letting him unleash hissinging voice, died at 71 late Wednesday night at his Bel AirEstates home.   He had never fully recovered from a fall 3{ months ago, andreturned home after treatment this week at St. John's Hospital andHealth Center in Santa Monica. The cause of death was pneumonia,said his mother-in-law, Margaret Almquist.   ``I'm very, very saddened by Dennis' death,'' said comedianJerry Lewis, national chairman of the Muscular DystrophyAssociation, for which Day worked. ``He was a great friend _ to meand to so many during his life. When he found out that he had ALS _the disease that led inexorably to his death _ he put all theremaining energy he had into helping MDA fight this tragicdisorder.''   Doctors discovered last summer that Day had amyotropic lateralsclerosis, the nerve disorder known as Lou Gehrig's disease thatcauses gradual loss of muscle control. He injured his head in thefall March 9 and had been hospitalized more than four weeks sincethen, at times in critical condition.   Day's wife and Mrs. Almquist's daughter, Peggy Margaret McNulty,was admitted to St. John's on Wednesday for cardiac tests and wasin fair condition Thursday, hospital spokesman Armen Markariansaid. He added that doctors had not determined whether she suffereda heart attack.   Day played a dimwitted stooge on Benny's radio and TV varietyshows, but he was shrewd in his contract maneuvering with studiosand networks.   ``I'm sorry about Dennis. I thought he was one of a kind,'' saidMilton Berle, who knew Day for 40 years. ``Through the tutorage ofmy pal, Jack Benny, he became a very good foil and straight mancharacter for Jack. Show business is going to miss him.''   ``He was a great actor and great comedian and a great foil forJack Benny. He was the crazy kid who did the silly things. They gotalong very well together,'' said Irving Fein, Benny's formermanager who now manages George Burns.   Day was also recalled as a family man who chose to spend timewith his 10 children rather than running with a Hollywood crowd.   ``Warm, wonderful, loving, caring, always giving,'' is howactress Ann Blyth remembered her brother-in-law. The star of``Mildred Pierce,'' ``Kismet'' and ``The Helen Morgan Story'' ismarried to Day's brother, James McNulty, and recalled the largefamily get-togethers with their five children and Day's 10.   ``Our family get-togethers were indeed warm and wonderfulmemories to have,'' Miss Blyth said. ``To lose someone so dear isindeed a great loss, but when you have lovely memories, it somehowmakes it easier.''   ``Americans couldn't do any better for the likes of a role-modelhusband and father than Dennis Day,'' added Ralph Edwards, host ofthe old ``This is Your Life'' and ``Truth or Consequences'' shows.   Born Owen Patrick McNulty to Irish parents in New York City onMay 21, 1917, he was graduated from St. Patrick's Cathedral HighSchool and attended Manhattan College with plans to enter Fordham'slaw school.   But then he learned Benny needed a singer to replace KennyBaker. A recording Day had made earned him an audition, and anoff-the-cuff wisecrack helped land him the job.   He assumed the name Dennis Day when he joined Benny's radio showas a singer in 1939.   ``Gee, Mr. Benny!'' became a trademark line on Benny's radio andTV variety shows. The remark came from Day when a skit situationseemed to overwhelm him.   Besides his success as a foil, Day gained popularity as an Irishtenor with his renditions of ``Danny Boy,'' ``McNamara's Band,''``Clancy Lowered the Boom,'' and other ballads. Another Dayfavorite, ``Peg of my Heart'' was a ballad he sang for his wife.   Benny and Day began appearing on TV in 1950, and in 1951 Daylanded a movie contract with 20th-Century Fox. At the time, he wasthe only Fox contract player with television rights. He also signeda contract with NBC, after allowing weeks of bidding between thenetwork and competitor CBS.   Day is survived by his wife, a brother, six sons, fourdaughters, and 13 grandchildren. Funeral services are planned nextweek, depending on Mrs. McNulty's health.</TEXT></DOC>
