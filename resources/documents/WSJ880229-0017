Witcher (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> ECO </IN><TEXT>   For the first time since last October's stock market crash, more Americans see a strong economy instead of a weak one in the year ahead, a University of Michigan survey found.    The survey provides further evidence that a recession isn't likely this year. The university's Index of Consumer Sentiment, compiled by its Institute for Social Research in Ann Arbor, rose to 90.8 in January, up from 86.8 in December.    The latest index even surpassed the 90.4 year-earlier level, rebounding for the second-straight month after plummeting to 83.1 following the market collapse.    While the rebound dispelled fears that a recession will occur this year, &quot;concerns about the longer-term vitality of the economy still remain,&quot; said Richard T. Curtin, the survey director.    January survey results show that more families expect good economic times instead of bad in 1988. In January, 47% saw the economy favorably and 37% unfavorably, compared with 38% favorably and 45% unfavorably in November.    Despite the turnaround in the immediate economic outlook, the percentage of households predicting the U.S. economy will worsen over the next five years rose to 50% in January, from 44% in December.    The major immediate concern -- expressed by 54% of the households surveyed -- is rising interest rates. Mr. Curtin said the expectation of rising rates may cause a slowdown in buying new homes and cars, and thus may produce sluggish economic growth, without falling mortgage rates or car-sales incentives.    The January survey results show &quot;the stock market crash has had only a small and temporary impact on consumer confidence,&quot; Mr. Curtin said. &quot;Following their initial reaction to the plunge in stock prices, consumers have now regained confidence in the domestic economy.&quot;    The University of Michigan group has conducted the survey since 1946. Retailers and manufacturers use the results to gauge economic activity and trends. The latest survey results are based on interviews with 500 households nationwide conducted between Jan. 4 and Jan. 31. The sample error was plus or minus five percentage points.    The index is tied to a value of 100 for 1966. The latest results mean the public is 90.8% as confident in the economic outlook as in 1966. November's 83.1 was the lowest point the index had reached since 1983. In early 1984 it hit a high of 100. </TEXT></DOC>
