Also Saturday, troops burned uniforms belonging to PLO militantsthat had been stored in an Islamic shrine. They also torched severalcopies of the Koran, the holy book of Moslems, according to Arabreports.   Arab reports said the strike was observed in the seaside GazaStrip, where troops on Friday shot and killed three Palestinians.   New confrontations were reported Saturday, and officials at GazaCity's Shifa hospital said they treated eight wounded, includingthree teen-agers, from the Shati refugee camp, the village of BeitHanoun and Gaza City.   In the Khan Yunis refugee camp, soldiers shot Akram MohammedSchade Saada in the neck and he later died at the nearby NasserHospital, hospital officials and Israel radio reported. The militarycommand said it was checking the report.   The army immediately imposed a curfew on the camp, forcing its35,000 residents to stay indoors, Arab reports said.   Saada was the fourth Palestinian killed in Gaza in two days; 521Arabs have been killed since December 1987, when the uprisingagainst Israeli rule of the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank began.Twenty-two Israelis also have died.   In the West Bank, merchants also shuttered their stores andtransport was grounded, Arab reports said.   Seven Palestinians were wounded in scattered clashes in the WestBank, including a 13-year-old boy shot in the leg during an armyraid on the village of Burin, hospital officials said. The armyconfirmed one wounded.   According to Arab accounts, the army raided the West Bankvillages of Osarin and Hawara, and about two dozen residents werereported beaten with assault rifles.   During a raid on Kafr ed-Dik soldiers uncovered a cache ofuniforms belonging to activists of the Palestinian Popular Army, anumbrella group of uprising leaders usually linked to the PLO.   The uniforms were hidden in a ``makam Islami'' or an Islamicshrine, and soldiers torched them together with several copies ofthe Koran, Arab reports said. The army command said it would lookinto the reports.   Saturday's general strike was called by the PLO-led undergroundleaders of the uprising to protest Israel's Middle East peace planand press demands for an international peace conference.   The peace initiative, put forward by Prime Minister YitzhakShamir, calls for Palestinian elections in the occupied territoriesto choose non-PLO representatives, who would negotiate temporaryself-rule with Israel.   In a leaflet, activists called the plan a conspiracy and said thestrike was to ``call on the American administration to hold aninternational conference, as it is the only way to reach peace inthe region.''   Shamir is a staunch opponent of an international conference,saying Israel might be forced to make territorial concessions.   On Friday, the eve of the strike, violent clashes broke out inthe Gaza Strip town of Rafah, where soldiers killed three. The citywas placed under an indefinite curfew, forcing more than 50,000Arabs to stay inside their homes.   The head of the army's southern command, Maj. Gen. YitzhakMordechai, visited Rafah on Saturday to question troops about theclashes. The army said an initial investigation showed that soldiersacted after they were attacked by Palestinians who hurled rocks andmetal bars.</TEXT></DOC>
