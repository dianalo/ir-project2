(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a decision that could fatten statecoffers by millions of dollars, the state Supreme Court ruledTuesday that Connecticut companies should not have written offcommissions they paid to their international sales subsidiaries.   In the unanimous decision, the high court said the state taxcode did not allow manufacturing companies to deduct thecommissions they paid to their ``domestic international salescorporations'' or DISCs from state corporation income taxes from1981 to 1984.   Richard D. Nicholson, legal director of the Department ofRevenue Services, said the ruling is worth at least $3 million tothe state. He said the state knows of about $1.5 million in taxesdeducted as commissions. Another $1.5 million collected by thestate was, in effect, frozen in state accounts until the high courtmade its decision, he said.   Nicholson said using DISCs, which allowed federal taxwrite-offs, was a common business practice between 1972 and 1984.Several Connecticut companies believed they were eligible forsimilar state write-offs in 1981 when the state's tax code changed,he said.   Nicholson said the ruling could affect numerous Connecticutcompanies who may find themselves owing the state money.   He also said the Connecticut Supreme Court ruling could proveprecedent-setting elswhere, although he did not know how many otherstates face similar cases.   The Connecticut decision knocked down a challenge raised by BoltTechnology Corp, a Norwalk-based maker of seismic sound sourcesystems; Olin Corporation Inc., a Stamford-based chemical company,and Perkin-Elmer Corp., a Norwalk-based optical instrument and lensmaker.   Olin and Perkin-Elmer owe about $1.2 million in taxes because ofthe high court's ruling, Nicholson said. Bolt Technology had paid$115,000 in taxes on the commission, but that payment had been puton hold pending the outcome of the court case, he said.   There were about 15 other pending cases on the matter, saidPhyllis Tarizek, spokewoman for the state Department of RevenueServices.   ``Not only will we have the millions of dollars that were put onhold, we are not going to lose a lot of money we brought in. Thatwas a big concern. We're happy,'' Tarizek said.   Timothy F. Bannon, Commissioner of Revenue Services, said ``I'mdelighted, but not surprised, to be vindicated by the state SupremeCourt.''   The federal tax code, from 1972 through 1984, allowed companiesto create DISCs as a way to encourage foreign sales, Nicholsonsaid. The companies set up the subsidiaries to lease or sell goodsin another country. In turn, the companies with DISCs were eligiblefor federal tax breaks.   Under the state tax code revised in 1981, Connecticut allowedcompanies to write off dividends from their state corporationincome taxes. But the state said companies had to pay taxes onexpenses related to their dividends.   The high court agreed with the state claim that the DISCs wereexpenses related to dividends, and therefore subject to statetaxes, Nicholson said.   ``Of course, I'm disappointed that the court took the contraryopinion,'' said George G. Vest, the Stamford-based attorney forOlin and Perkin-Elmer corporations.</TEXT></DOC>
