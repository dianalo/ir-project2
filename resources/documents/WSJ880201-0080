The negotiations mark the second consecutive time in which the UMW and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, the industry's primary bargaining group, have been able to forge an accord without a major industry work stoppage. Still, some companies are bound to forgo this so-called national wage and they face possible walkouts.    A UMW source said that, unlike the past several contracts, the new one isn't supposed to last for 40 months. He wouldn't say how the length varied, however, and it also wasn't clear if any wage or benefit increases were included.    But union sources confirmed that the settlement -- apparently reached sometime Saturday afternoon at the Capital Hilton Hotel in Washington -- at least in some ways, is similar to one reached last February with Island Creek Corp. Under that pact, Island Creek, an Occidental Petroleum Corp. unit, promised to give laid-off UMW employees the first shot at available jobs in return for a reduced payment to a union pension fund. One union source cautioned, however, that &quot;some distinctions have to be made&quot; between the proposed contract and the Island Creek accord.    Because the new pact must be approved by the 15 companies in the bargaining group as well as by UMW's membership, the current contract effectively has been extended -- the first time ever. It was scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m. today. UMW leaders from across the country are scheduled to arrive in Washington Tuesday to receive briefings on terms of the agreement; a ratification vote is set for Feb. 8.    Richard Trumka, UMW president, said at a news conference Saturday in Washington that the new contract &quot;significantly expanded job opportunities&quot; for union members, but he didn't elaborate. Mr. Trumka has sounded a similar theme ever since calling a first-ever, special union convention in Atlanta in October 1986. At that convention, the popular and personable union chief consolidated his power by lifting a $70-million cap on the union's selective strike fund. The fund now stands near $100 million.    Although hundreds of companies already have pledged to sign agreements that mirror the one reached in Washington, several sizable producers continue to seek more favorable terms.    One of those firms, Pittston Coal Group Inc., said last week that it had anticipated being struck yesterday. It wasn't, but union officials said they weren't ruling one out. In 1984, selective strikes were brought against at least a half dozen Eastern producers.    &quot;Just because they reached a tentative agreement doesn't make all the problems go away,&quot; said Charles Gilliam, a West Virginia labor relations expert who represents some of the hold-out companies. &quot;These companies just can't stay competitive.&quot;    Metallurgical coal companies, particularly, no longer feel as if the coal operators association -- and its pugnacious lead negotiator, Bobby R. Brown -- is looking out for their best interests. The market for metallurgical coal, used to make steel, has a different set of economics than does the market for steam coal, used by electric utilities. This year was the first that no metallurgical companies were seated at the bargaining table.    The mood in various of the UMW's 21 districts was positive, albeit cautious, yesterday. At the District 6 office in Shadeyside, Ohio, local board member Dick Wayt said his 4,500 active miners feel &quot;a sense of relief.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
