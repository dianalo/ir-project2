<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-83-0445 </DOCNO><TEXT>Oscillating Field-Current Drive (OFCD) was originally proposed as a meansof maintaining a quasi-steady-state plasma current in a RFP without buildingup the magnetizing flux threading the central hole of the torus. TheMHD dynamics of OFCD is analyzed using a combination of a 1-D transportcode, a linear resistive MHD stability model, and Kadomtsev nonlinearglobal reconnection model. Using Faraday's law, Ohm's law and on-axisregularity conditions, it is shown that m = 1 modes are necessary forcurrent drive, within the resistive MHD model. A class of m = 1 tearingmodes that nonlinearly generate poloidal flux (a necessary conditionfor current drive) was identified. These modes are destabilized by off-axiscurrent peaks. A scoping study of the F-Theta space was undertaken todetermine quantitatively the effectiveness of this class of tearing modesas a current-drive mechanism. A scenario of the OFCD oscillations wasdeveloped in terms of the evolution of the safety-factor profile, byconsidering the stability of the RFP to current-driven tearing modes.Transport simulations of the single-circuit oscillations indicate thatthe RFP dynamo is definitely present during half of the oscillation period,while the other half cycle exhibits only small off-axis current peaksat best.</TEXT></DOC>
