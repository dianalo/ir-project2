U.S. officials privately predict that the emergingeconomic ties between the two countries will temper Sovietopposition to German unification. But the Soviet Union andGermany also are finding common ground on political andstrategic issues -- a development that could threatenWashington's hopes of keeping Germany firmly in the Westernorbit.</LP><TEXT>   The potential bond between Europe's two strongest powersis likely to be built on an economic foundation. &quot;The Sovietsneed Germany economically,&quot; said one top Bush administrationpolicy-maker, who reviewed the recent opening round ofsix-power talks on German unification.   &quot;They depended on East Germany for so much,&quot; he said, &quot;andthey're going to need united Germany to continue that trade.Plus they need new investment from Germany. So they're notlikely to want to be viewed as the only power blocking Germanunification.&quot;   Others agree. &quot;The Soviet Union's largest East Europeantrading partner is East Germany, its largest Western tradingpartner is West Germany,&quot; says Charles Gati, a specialist onSoviet-East European affairs at Union College and author of anew book on the subject. &quot;So you can just imagine theeconomic stakes the Soviet Union has with the new Germany.&quot;   Adds former State Department official Robert Hormats, nowwith Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., &quot;The economic relationship withGermany is Gorbachev's ace in the hole. In the final unitydeal, he can extract economic concessions from the Germans.&quot;   Signs of such a potential trade-off were sprinkled throughan otherwise negative Soviet performance at the unity talks,which are formally called the &quot;Two-Plus-Four&quot; negotiations.Shortly before laying down strong private objections toGerman membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organizationand making other demands, Soviet Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze held a long, cordial meeting with West GermanChancellor Helmut Kohl to discuss bilateral relations,including economic ties.   Mr. Shevardnadze said he and Mr. Kohl had &quot;noted that thepotential for cooperation between our two countries is as yetnot fully exhausted. There are great reserves. There's agreat deal yet to be done, and we discussed ways of makinguse of, of drawing on those reserves.&quot;   The Soviet foreign minister also refused to restate onWest German television the strong Soviet objections to Germanmembership in NATO, saying only that he was optimistic asettlement could be reached. His aides distributed his toughremarks, including a refusal to grant the new Germany fullsovereignty, only to Soviet and East German reporters.   Mr. Kohl has pledged that the new Germany will honorexisting trade and contract commitments between the Sovietsand East Germany, a costly proposition for Germany, becauseit could require maintaining production of some items to meetSoviet specifications, even though they can't be sold in theWest.   Last year in Bonn, Mr. Kohl and Soviet President MikhailGorbachev signed a &quot;comprehensive economic collaboration&quot;stepping up trade and investment. An investment treaty hasbeen signed, Soviet executives are being trained in WestGermany, and German banks have set up a $1 billion creditline for Soviet trade.   &quot;The Soviets realize that the united Germany has a growthpotential from which they can profit if they reform theireconomy,&quot; says a German diplomat. &quot;We've made that very clearto them.&quot;   But money, important as it is to the near-bankruptU.S.S.R., isn't the only tie that binds the two Europeanpowers. Aware of Soviet security fears, German officials havewon U.S. support for a plan to keep NATO forces out of formerEast German territory after unification. They have invitedthe Red Army to remain in East German territory during atransition period that could last seven years. The newGermany will even pay for the troops.   Most importantly, there is broad agreement between Germanand Soviet leaders on the desirability of establishing somenew, vaguely defined Pan-European security system under theauspices of the existing Conference on Security andCooperation in Europe.   This idea, which makes U.S. officials nervous, has widepopular appeal and is embraced to varying degrees by allpolitical parties in both Germanys. So far, German leadersinsist the new system would complement, not replace, NATO.But the Soviet strategy is to build on this romantic Germannotion of a Pan-European security system and eventually driveNATO out of business by replacing it with the new securitysystem.   And despite the bitter legacy of World War II, there arehistoric precedents for Russian-German cooperation. &quot;Whenthey weren't fighting each other, the Russians have used theGermans as advisers for years,&quot; says Mr. Hormats. &quot;Forcenturies, there has been a love-hate relationship betweenRussia and Germany.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
