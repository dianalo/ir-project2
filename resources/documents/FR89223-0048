BPA requests that all comments and documentsintended to become part of the Official Record in this process containthe file number designation WP-89. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUMMARY: </T2>The Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and ConservationAct (Northwest Power Act) states that BPA must establish and periodicallyreview and revise BPA's rates so that they are adequate to recover, inaccordance with sound business principles, the costs associated with theacquisition, conservation, and transmission of electric power, and to recoverthe Federal investment in the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS).BPA has reviewed its current wholesale power rate schedules which becameeffective on October 1, 1987. Based on this review, BPA has determinedthat current wholesale power rate schedules will continue to produce sufficientrevenue for BPA to meet its statutory requirements for Fiscal Years (FY)1990 and 1991. BPA therefore is proposing to extend its 1987 rates by readoptingits 1987 Rate Schedules, with a modified Cost Recovery Adjustment Clause,as its 1989 wholesale power rate schedules to be effective through FY 1990and 1991. Through a separate public involvement process, BPA has completed a thoroughreview of program cost levels for the budget for FY 1990 and 1991. TheAdministrator will not reexamine program level decisions in the rate case.Beginning in October 1988, BPA conducted a series of workshops on subjectsrelevant to BPA's ratesetting. The purpose of the workshops was to identify,simplify and reduce the numbers of issues that might become a part of a1989 rate case. All parties to the 1987 rate case were informed of andinvited to the workshops. The workshops were well attended and providedopportunities for informal public comment on issues outside the formalhearing process. Opportunities will be available for interested persons to review BPA'sproposal to readopt the 1987 rates based on the existing supporting studies,to participate in the rate hearing, and to submit written comments. Duringthe development of the final rate proposal, BPA will evaluate all writtenand oral comments received in this process. Consideration of comments andmore current data may result in the final rate proposal differing fromthe rates proposed in this notice. <T3>Responsible Official</T3>: Ms. Shirley R. Melton, Director, Divisionof Contracts and Rates, is the official responsible for the developmentof BPA's rates.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Persons wishing to become a formal ``party'' to the proceedingsmust notify BPA in writing of their intention to do so in accordance withrequirements stated in this notice.

Introduction </ITAG>On December 23, 1988, in order to satisfy contractual provisions betweenBPA and its customers, BPA published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>a notice of ``Intent to Revise Wholesale PowerRates to Become Effective October 1, 1989,'' 53 FR 51890. Since then, BPAhas continued to study the adequacy of its current rates and has concludedthat current rates, with a modified Cost Recovery Adjustment Clause (CRAC),will be adequate for the FYs 1990-1991 rate period. In order to assess its current rates, BPA first determined the amount ofrevenue required to meet its financial obligations in FY 1990 and 1991.BPA has determined that the revenues BPA would expect to collect from projectedloads under its current rates will adequately cover these revenue requirements.Therefore, BPA proposes to readopt and refile the current 1987 wholesalepower rates as the proposed 1989 wholesale power rates. BPA files its rateswith the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). However, BPA proposesto replace the 1987 Cost Recovery Adjustment Clause with a similar butredesigned version. The new proposed CRAC is defined in this <T4>Federal Register </T4>Notice within affected rate schedules and inthe General Rate Schedule Provisions (GRSPs). The proposed wholesale power rates were prepared in accordance with BPA'sstatutory authority to develop rates, including the Bonneville ProjectAct of 1937, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 832e, f (1982); the Flood Control Actof 1944, 16 U.S.C. 825s (1982); the Regional Preference Act, 16 U.S.C.837 (1982); the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act, 16 U.S.C.838g, h (1982); and the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and ConservationAct of 1980, 16 U.S.C. 839 (1982). The rate schedules contained in this publication were established, in accordancewith the Northwest Power Act, which was signed into law on December 5,1980. The proposed rate schedules reflect many requirements contained principallyin the Northwest Power Act's rate directives (section 7), as well as theconditions related to classes of customers and services contained in theNorthwest Power Act's power sales directives (section 5). BPA proposes that its wholesale power rate schedules and the General RateSchedule Provisions associated with these schedules become effective uponinterim approval or final confirmation and approval by the FERC. BPA willrequest FERC approval effective October 1, 1989. Section I.A. of the GRSP'sspecifies the proposed effective date for each rate. The 1989 wholesale power rate schedules, and the GRSPs associated withthese rate schedules, are, with the exception of a modified CRAC (and afew other changes identified in Section IV below), identical to BPA's 1987rate schedules. They supersede BPA's 1987 rate schedules (which becameeffective October 1, 1987) to the extent stated in the Availability sectionof each 1989 rate schedule. These schedules and GRSPs shall be applicableto all BPA contracts, including contracts executed both prior to and subsequentto enactment of the Northwest Power Act. In developing the proposed wholesale power rates, BPA considered many factors,including revenue requirements, ease of administration, revenue stability,rate continuity, ease of comprehension, and BPA's statutory obligations.The studies that have been prepared to support the proposed rates willbe available for examination on March 8, 1989, at BPA's Public InformationCenter, BPA Headquarters Building, first floor, 905 NE. 11th Avenue, Portland,Oregon. The studies will be mailed to all parties to BPA's 1987 rate case.The studies also may be requested by phone or in writing from BPA's PublicInvolvement office and will be available at the Prehearing Conference.The studies are: 1. Revenue Requirement Study and Technical Documentation. 2. Revenue Forecast Study and Technical Documentation. Persons seeking to become parties should not wait until the prehearingconference to obtain copies of the studies. Rather, potential parties shouldobtain the studies as soon as they are available so that they are conversantwith them at the time of the prehearing conference. Parties appearing atthe prehearing conference shall be required to state whether they willoppose BPA's rate proposal, provided that BPA will have first offered satisfactoryassurance that no substantive or procedural precedent shall arise by virtueof the substance, manner, or form of BPA's, or any other party's actionin connection with the rate proposal, and that the extended rates sufferthe same entire or partial legality as the 1987 wholesale power rates.The March 13, 1989, technical session is provided to assist parties intheir evaluation of BPA's proposal. To request either of the studies by telephone, call BPA's document requestline: 800-841-5867 for Oregon; 800-624-9495 for Washington, Idaho, Montana,California, Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada. Other callers should use 503-230-3478.Please request the study by its above title. Also state whether you requirethe accompanying technical documentation; otherwise the study alone willbe provided. (For example, ask for the ``Revenue Requirement Study andTechnical Documentation.'') <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Procedures Governinq Rate Adjustments and Public Participation</ITAG>Section 7(i) of the Northwest Power Act, 16 U.S.C. 839e(i), requires thatrates be established according to certain procedures. These proceduresinclude, among other things, issuance of a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice announcing the proposed rates; one ormore hearings; the opportunity to submit written views, supporting information,questions, and arguments; and a decision by the Administrator based onthe record developed during the hearing process. This proceeding will begoverned by BPA's ``Procedures Governing Bonneville Power AdministrationRate Hearings,'' 51 FR 7611 (March 5, 1986), which implements, and in mostinstances expands, the statutory requirements. The proceedings for BPA'sproposal to readopt transmission rates will be combined with the proceedingsfor BPA's proposal for readopt wholesale power rates. Among BPA's major customer groups, none have expressed opposition to theproposal to readopt rates. Thus, the Administrator firmly expects thatthe parties will not avail themselves of the opportunity for hearing affordedby BPA's procedures. In that event, and upon due and appropriate motion,the Hearing Officer will truncate the proceedings so that participantsmay be quickly heard and parties extended the opportunity to comment onthe Administrator's Draft Record of Decision. Should a truncated procedurebe adopted, the Administrator directs the Hearing Officer to incorporateby reference the Official Record compiled in BPA's 1987 Wholesale Powerand Transmission Rate proceeding into the Official Record in this proceeding.The hearing will be conducted according to the rule for general rate proceedings,andSection; 1010.9 of BPA's Procedures Governing Bonneville Power AdministrationRate Hearings. BPA's procedures provide for publication of a notice ofthe proposed rates, a prehearing conference, the opportunity for hearing,receipt of written comments, preparation of decisional documents, a decision,and the transmittal of the decision with supporting documentation to theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission. BPA distinguishes between ``participants in'' and ``parties to'' the hearings.Apart from the formal hearing process, BPA will receive comments, views,opinions, and information from ``participants,'' who are defined in theprocedures as any person who may express his views, but who does not successfullypetition to intervene as a party. Participants' written comments will bemade part of the official record of the case and considered by the Administrator.The participant category gives the public the opportunity to participateand have its views considered without assuming the obligations incumbentupon ``parties.'' Participants are not entitled to participate in the prehearingconference, cross examine parties' witnesses, seek discovery, or serveor be served with documents, and are not subject to the same proceduralrequirements as parties. Written comments by participants will be included in the record if theyare submitted before the close of the hearings. Written views, supportinginformation, questions, and arguments should be submitted to BPA's PublicInvolvement office. The second category of interest is that of a ``party'' as defined in andSection;andSection;1010.2 and 1010.4 of ``The Procedures Governing Bonneville Power AdministrationRate Hearings.'' 51 FR 7611 (March 5, 1986). Parties may participate inany aspect of the hearing process. Persons wishing to become a formal ``party'' to BPA's rate proceeding mustnotify BPA in writing of their request. These petitions to intervene shallstate the name and address of the person and the person's interests inthe outcome of the hearing. Petitioners may designate no more than tworepresentatives upon whom service of documents will be made. BPA customersand customer groups whose rates are subject to revision in the hearingwill be granted intervention, based on a petition filed in conformity withthis section. Other petitioners must explain their interests in sufficientdetail to permit the Hearing Officer to determine whether they have a relevantinterest in the hearing. Any opposition to a petition to intervene mustbe filed and served at least 24 hours before the March 16 prehearing conference.All timely applications will be ruled on by the Hearing Officer. Late interventionsare strongly disfavored. Opposition to an untimely petition to interveneshall be filed and served within 2 days after service of the petition.Intervention petitions will be available for inspection in BPA's PublicInformation Center, first floor, 905 NE. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon.Interventions are subject to andSection; 1010.4 of BPA's Procedures GoverningBonneville Power Administration Rate Hearings.The record will include, among other things, the transcripts of any hearings,any written material submitted by the parties and participants, documentsdeveloped by the BPA staff, and other material accepted into the recordby the Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer then will review the record,will supplement it if necessary, and will certify the record to the Administratorfor decision.The Administrator will develop the final proposed rates based on the entirerecord, including the record certified by the Hearing Officer, commentsreceived from participants, other material and information submitted toor developed by the Administrator, and any other comments received duringthe rate development process. The basis for the final proposed rates willbe first expressed in the Administrator's Draft Record of Decision (ROD).Parties will have an opportunity to comment on the draft as provided inBPA's hearing procedures. Absent comment, the Draft ROD will become Final.If comment is made, a Final ROD will be issued. The Administrator willserve copies of the Administrator s Record of Decision on all parties andwill file the final proposed rates together with the record with the FederalEnergy Regulatory Commission for confirmation and approval.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Major Studies and Issues</ITAG>A. Major Studies<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Revenue Requirement Study</ITAG>The Bonneville Project Act, the Flood Control Act of 1944, the FederalColumbia River Transmission System Act, and the Northwest Power Act requireBPA to design rates that are projected to return revenues sufficient torecover the cost of acquiring. conserving, and transmitting the electricpower that BPA markets. including the amortization of the Federal investmentin the FCRPS over a reasonable period, and to recover BPA's other costsand expenses. The Revenue Requirement Study includes a determination thatcurrent rates will produce enough revenue to recover all BPA costs andexpenses, including BPA's repayment obligations to the United States Treasury.The Transmission System Act and the Northwest Power Act require that transmissionrates be based on an equitable allocation of the costs of the Federal transmissionsystem between Federal and non-Federal power using the system. In compliancewith a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) order dated January27, 1984, 26 FERC 61,096, the Revenue Requirement Study incorporates theresults of separate repayment studies for the generation and transmissioncomponents of the FCRPS. The repayment studies for generation and transmissiondemonstrate the adequacy of the projected revenues to recover all of theFederal investment in the FCRPS over the allowable repayment period. Theadequacy of projected revenues to recover cost evaluation period revenuerequirements and to meet repayment period recovery of the Federal investmentare tested and demonstrated separately for the generation and transmissionfunctions.The Revenue Requirement Study for the 1989 initial rate proposal is basedon revenue and cost estimates for FY 1990 and 1991. BPA's Revenue RequirementStudy reflects actual amortization and interest payments paid through September30, 1988. In addition, it reflects all FCRPS obligations incurred pursuantto the Northwest Power Act, including exchange costs.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Revenue Forecast Study.</ITAG>The Revenue Forecast Study is divided into two parts. The first part, theRevenue Forecast, documents BPA's loads, resources, contracts, and revenuesthat are the basis for BPA's base case forecast. The second part, the RiskAssessment, documents the various risk factors and probabilities associatedwith these risk factors that cause BPA's revenues to vary. The RevenueForecast Study also documents several models that are used to prepare theRevenue Forecast and Risk Assessment, such as the load forecasting models,the Marketing Linear Programming Model, the Federal Secondary Energy Analysis,the Nonfirm Revenue Analysis Program, the Revenue Estimating Program, andthe Risk Analysis Program.The Revenue Forecast separately identifies revenues by rate schedule includingPriority Firm, Variable Industrial. Industrial Firm, Surplus Firm, Nonfirm,Firm Capacity, and various transmission service charges (e.g., IntertieNorth, Intertie South, Formula Power, Integration of Resources, IncidentalNetwork Transmission, TGT, UFT, and Oandamp;M). It also accounts for otherrevenue sources such as WNP-1 exchange, the WNP-3 settlement, CoordinationAgreement (charges) revenues, USBR pumping power, and several other miscellaneouscategories of revenues. All of these revenues are documented for FY 1989-1991on a monthly basis in the Revenue forecast.BPA revenues are subject to significant variation due to several variables.To measure the impact of these variables on BPA revenues. BPA performsa Risk Assessment Analysis. The Risk Assessment Analysis examines fivevariables that have a significant effect on BPA's revenues and includeshigh, medium and low forecasts for these variables. The five variablesare the economy (which includes aluminum prices and employment); the marketingenvironment (which includes natural gas prices and surplus power sales);streamflow conditions (precipitation); thermal resource performance; andresolution of WNP-1 exchange contract issues. These events are assumedto be independent of each other. A range of revenue outcomes is developedfor each year (FYs 1989-1991) from 243 possible scenarios. Probabilitiesare developed for each scenario based on the assumption that these eventsare independent. Each revenue scenario is compared to the expenses forFYs 1989 and 1990 to determine whether or not the proposed CRAC would triggerin the following year. The Risk Assessment Study explains this processin greater detail and determines the likelihood that BPA revenues willexceed expenses, and be adequate to meet payments to the Treasury.B. Other Issues <ITAG tagnum="81">Cost Recovery Adjustment Clause </ITAG>BPA has studied various methods of assuring its ability to recover allcosts and meet commitments to the U.S. Treasury during the 2-year costevaluation period. The Cost Recovery Adjustment Clause (CRAC) is the onlymethod proposed for this period that could result in a potential rate adjustment.The CRAC may adjust rates by a percentage determined by predetermined formulas,limited to an adjustment of 10.0 percent. The maximum recovery from a 10.0percent adjustment is estimated to be approximately $130 million per year.The Administrator has discretion to waive any adjustment. The CRAC will enhance BPA's ability to make its scheduled U.S. Treasurypayments with funds provided from current operations. It is designed toadjust, if necessary, the Priority Firm, Industrial Firm, Variable Industrial,Firm Capacity, and New Resource Firm Power rate schedules. The CRAC examines the net revenues (revenues minus expenses) for each fiscalyear, 1989 and 1990. If the net revenues for either year are less thanzero, rates in the following year may be adjusted to recover the shortfall.The adjustment resulting from the examination of net revenues for FY 1989would be applied from January 1, 1990, through September 30, 1990. Theadjustment resulting from the examination of net revenues for FY 1990 wouldbe applied from January 1, 1991, through September 30, 1991. If any adjustment is made to rates in 1990 due to a net revenue underrunin FY 1989, FY 1990 net revenues will be adjusted before determining theneed for or level of a CRAC adjustment in 1991. The adjustment will consistof subtracting the amount of revenues targeted for collection in 1990 througha CRAC adjustment from actual FY 1990 revenues. If the CRAC is triggered in either year, BPA will convene a public processto review and examine the appropriate data. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Wholesale Power Rate Schedules and General Rate Schedule Provisions</ITAG>BPA proposes to extend the 1987 Wholesale Power Rates by readopting themas the 1989 Wholesale Power Rates with the following exceptions. First,BPA will not seek further approval or comments on the following: the VariableIndustrial Power Rate Schedule (VI-87), the Long-Term Surplus Firm PowerRate Schedule (SL-87), or the NF Rate Cap. VI-87 is in effect through July31. 1993, unless BPA elects to terminate the rate at midnight June 30.1991. Under Modified SL-87, contracts may be negotiated through September30, 1990. BPA will maintain the NF Rate Cap for the 12-year period startingOctober 1, 1987 to apply to all nonfirm energy sales. Second, because of the new CRAC design, the following sections have beenchanged from the 1987 Wholesale Power Rate Schedules and GRSPs: Section III.C.5. describing the new CRAC has been replaced with the incorporatedtext. Specific CRAC sections in the Priority Firm Power, (section IV.E.), IndustrialFirm Power (section IV.C.). Variable Industrial Power (section VI.J.),Firm Capacity (section IV.D.), and New Resource Firm Power (section IV.B.)rate schedules contain minor revisions in order to reflect the changesin the GRSPs. Finally, the filing of the Modified SL-87 rate schedule in August 1987included some changes to the GRSPs. Although those changes are not thesubject of this rate refiling, they are incorporated in the GRSPs printedin this notice. <ITAG tagnum="74">Wholesale Power Rate Schedules and General Rate Schedule Provisions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Table of Contents </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Wholesale Power Rate Schedules </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">PF-89 Priority Firm Power Rate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">IP-89 Industrial Firm Power Rate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">SI-89 Special Industrial Power Rate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CF-89 Firm Capacity Rate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CE-89 Emergency Capacity Rate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">NR-89 New Resource Firm Power Rate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">SP-89 Short-Term Surplus Firm Power Rate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">NF-89 Nonfirm Energy Rate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">SS-89 Share-the-Savings Energy Rate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">RP-89 Reserve Power Rate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">General Rate Schedule Provisions </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Section I Adoption of Revised Rate Schedules and General Rate ScheduleProvisions </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Section II Types of BPA Service </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Section III Billing Factors and Billing Adjustments </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Section IV Other Definitions </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Section V Application of Rates Under Special Circumstances </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Section VI Billing Information </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Section VII Variable Industrial Rate Parameters and Adjustments </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Schedule PF-89 Priority Firm Power Rate </ITAG>Section I.

Adoption of Revised Rate Schedules and General Rate ScheduleProvisions</ITAG>A. Approval of RatesThese 1989 rate schedules and General Rate Schedule Provisions (GRSPs)shall become effective upon interim approval or final confirmation andapproval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). BPA will requestFERC approval effective October 1, 1989. BPA proposes that the followingschedules, and the GRSPs associated with these schedules, be effectivefor 2 years: PF-89, IP-89, SI-89, CE-89, CF-89, NR-89, SS-89, SP-89, NF-89,and RP-89. The VI-87 rate schedule reflects adjustments of and supplementsto the rate schedule VI-86 and associated GRSPs (which are to be in effectfor 7 years). Sections III.A and VI.J of the VI-87 rate schedule are tobe in effect for an additional 2 years. BPA proposes that rate scheduleSI-89 be effective 2 years, except for the Special Industrial Offpeak rateprovision, which is to remain in effect through June 30, 1990, pursuantto an Amendatory Agreement between BPA and Hanna Nickel Smelting Companyexecuted July 1. 1985. BPA proposes that the SP-89 rate schedule, and theGRSPs associated with this schedule, be effective for 5 years.B. General ProvisionsThese 1989 rate schedules, and the GRSPs associated with these rate schedules,supersede BPA's 1987 rate schedules (which became effective October 1,1987) to the extent stated in the Availability section of each 1989 rateschedule. These schedules and GRSPs shall be applicable to all BPA contracts,including contracts executed both prior to and subsequent to enactmentof the Northwest Power Act. All sales of power made under these rate schedulesare subject to the following acts as amended: the Bonneville Project Act,the Regional Preference Act (Pub. L. 88-552), the Federal Columbia RiverTransmission System Act, and the Northwest Power Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section II. Types of BPA Service</ITAG>A. Priority Firm PowerPriority Firm Power is electric power (capacity, energy, or capacity andenergy) that BPA will make continuously available for resale to ultimateconsumers, or for direct consumption, construction, test and start-up,and station service by public bodies, cooperatives, and Federal agencies.(Construction, test and start-up, and station service are defined in sectionV.B of these GRSPs.)Utilities participating in the exchange under section 5(c) of the NorthwestPower Act may purchase Priority Firm Power pursuant to their ResidentialPurchase and Sale Agreements.In addition, BPA may make Priority Firm Power available to those partiesparticipating in exchange agreements specifying use of the Priority Firmrate for determining the amount or value of power to be exchanged.Power purchased under the power rate schedule is to be used to meet thepurchaser's actual firm load within the Pacific Northwest. Such power maybe restricted in accordance with the Restriction of Deliveries sectionof these GRSPs (section V.E). However, BPA shall not restrict PriorityFirm Power until Industrial Firm Power has been restricted in accordancewith the provisions of section II.C of these GRSPs.Priority Firm Power is not available to serve New Large Single Loads.B. New Resource Firm PowerNew Resource Firm Power is electric power (capacity, energy, or capacityand energy) that BPA will make continuously available:1. For any New Large Single Load,2. For firm power purchased by investor-owned utilities pursuant to powersales contracts with BPA, and3. For construction, test and start-up, and station service for facilitiesowned or operated by investor-owned utilities.New Resource Firm Power is to be used to meet the purchaser's actual firmload within the Pacific Northwest. Such power may be restricted in accordancewith the Restriction of Deliveries section of these GRSPs (section V.E).However, BPA shall not restrict New Resource Firm Power until IndustrialFirm Power has been restricted in accordance with the provisions of sectionII.C of these GRSPs.C. Industrial Firm PowerIndustrial Firm Power is electric power that BPA will make continuouslyavailable to a direct-service industrial (DSI) purchaser pursuant to theDSI's power sales contract and subject to: 1. The restriction applicableto deliveries of all firm power pursuant to the Uncontrollable Forces andContinuity of Service provisions of the General Contract Provisions ofthe power sales contract, and, 2. The restrictions given in the Restrictionof Deliveries section of the power sales contract.D. Special Industrial PowerSpecial Industrial Power is electric power which BPA will make continuouslyavailable to any DSI that qualifies for the Special Industrial Power ratepursuant to section 7(d)(2) of the Northwest Power Act. This power is similarin nature to Industrial Firm Power, but is subject to greater restrictionby BPA. Special Industrial Power is made available to the qualifying DSIupon adoption of, and subject to, an amendment modifying its power salescontract.E. Auxiliary PowerAuxiliary Power is that power which a DSI requests and which BPA agreesto make available to serve that portion of the DSI's load which is in excessof the DSI's Operating Demand for Industrial Firm Power or Special IndustrialPower.F. Firm CapacityFirm Capacity is capacity that BPA assures will be available in the amount(s)and during the period(s) specified in the power sales contract. The energyassociated with this capacity must be returned to BPA. Firm Capacity maybe restricted pursuant to the Restriction of Deliveries section of theseGRSPs (section V.E).G. Surplus Firm PowerSurplus Firm Power is firm energy, firm power (firm energy with capacity).and firm capacity (capacity with energy return requirements) in excessof the amount required to meet BPA's existing contractual obligations toprovide firm service. Surplus Firm Power may be used either for resaleor direct consumption by purchasers both inside and outside the UnitedStates. Such power, however, may be restricted pursuant to the Restrictionof Deliveries section of these GRSPs (section V.E).H. Nonfirm EnergyNonfirm Energy is supplied or made available by BPA to a purchaser underan arrangement that does not have the guaranteed continuous availabilityfeature of firm power. Nonfirm energy is mostly sold under the NonfirmEnergy rate schedule, NF-89. Nonfirm energy also may be supplied underthe Share-the-Savings rate schedule, SS-89, which is available as an experimentalrate for contract purchase.In addition, BPA also can make nonfirm energy available under the NonfirmEnergy rate schedule to the Western Systems Power Pool (WSPP) subject toterms and conditions agreed upon by the members participating in the WSPPand in accordance with BPA policy for such arrangements.However, Nonfirm Energy that has been purchased under a guarantee provisionin the Nonfirm Energy rate schedule shall be provided to the purchaserin accordance with the provisions of that schedule and the power salescontract if applicable. BPA may make Nonfirm Energy available to purchasersboth inside and outside the United States.I. Reserve PowerReserve Power is firm power sold to a purchaser: 1. In cases where thepurchaser's power sales contract states that the rate for Reserve Powershall be applied; 2. To provide service when no other type of power isdeemed applicable; and 3. To serve the purchaser's firm power loads undercircumstances where BPA does not have a power sales contract in force withthe purchaser.Sales of Reserve Power are subject to the Restriction of Deliveries sectionof these GRSPs (section V.E).<ITAG tagnum="84">Section III. Billing Factors and Billing Adjustments</ITAG>A. Billing Factors for Demand<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Measured Demand</ITAG>The purchaser's Measured Demand shall be determined in the manner describedin this section. Measured Demand shall be that portion of the metered orscheduled demand that is purchased from BPA under the applicable rate schedule.For those contracts to which BPA is a party and that provide for deliveryof more than one class of electric power to the purchaser at any pointof delivery, the portion of each 60-minute clock-hour integrated demandassigned to any class of power shall be determined pursuant to the powersales contract. The portion of the total Measured Demand so assigned shallconstitute the Measured Demand for each such class of power.The Measured Demand shall be determined from the metered demand or thescheduled demand, as hereinafter defined. The Measured Demand shall bedetermined on either a coincidental or a noncoincidental basis, as providedin the purchaser's power sales contract.a. <T3>Metered Demand. </T3>The metered demand in kilowatts shall be the largestof the 60-minute clock-hour integrated demands, adjusted as specified inthe power sales contract, at which electric energy is delivered to a purchaser:(1) At each point of delivery for which the metered demand is the basisfor determination of the Measured Demand. (2) During each time period specifiedin the applicable rate schedule, and, (3) During any billing period.Such largest integrated demand shall be determined from measurements madeeither in the manner specified in the power sales contract or as providedin section VI.A herein. In determining the metered demand, BPA shall excludeany abnormal integrated demands due to or resulting from:(1) Emergencies or breakdowns on, or maintenance of, the Federal systemfacilities, and(2) Emergencies on the purchaser's facilities, provided that such facilitieshave been adequately maintained and prudently operated, as determined byBPA.b. <T3>Scheduled Demand. </T3>The scheduled demand in kilowatts shall be thelargest of the hourly demands at which electric energy is scheduled fordelivery to a purchaser:(1) To each system for which scheduled demand is the basis for determinationof the Measured Demand,(2) During each time period specified in the applicable rate schedule,and(3) During any billing period.Scheduled amounts are deemed delivered for the purpose of determining billingdemand.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Ratchet Demand</ITAG>The Ratchet Demand in kilowatts shall be the maximum demand establishedduring a specified period of time either during or prior to the currentbilling period. The demand on which the ratchet is based is specified inthe relevant rate schedule or in these GRSPs. For utilities purchasingunder the PF or NR rate schedules, the Ratchet Demand is based on the highestdemand during prior billing months. When the Ratchet Demand is used asa billing factor, BPA shall have specified in the appropriate schedulesor GRSPs:a. The period of time over which the ratchet shall be calculated,b. The type of demand to be used in the calculation, andc. The percentage (if any) of that demand which will be used to calculatethe Ratchet Demand.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Contract Demand</ITAG>The Contract Demand shall be the maximum number of kilowatts that the purchaseragrees to purchase and BPA agrees to make available, subject to any limitationsincluded in the power sales contract. BPA may agree to make deliveriesat a rate in excess of the Contract Demand at the request of the purchaser,but shall not be obligated to continue such excess deliveries. Any contractualor other reference to Contract Demand as expressed in kilowatthours shallbe deemed, for the purpose of these GRSPs, to refer to the term ``ContractEnergy.''<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Computed Peak Requirement</ITAG>For purchasers designated to purchase on the basis of computed requirements,the Computed Peak Requirement shall be determined as specified in the purchaser'spower sales contract. That specification is provided in:a. Sections 16, 17(c), and 17(f), as adjusted by other sections of thecontract, for actual computed requirements purchasers;b. Sections 16, 17(a), and 17(f), as adjusted by other sections of thecontract, for planned computed requirements purchasers; andc. Sections 16 and 17(b), as adjusted by other sections of the contract,for contracted computed requirements purchasers.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Computed Average Energy Requirement</ITAG>For computed requirements purchasers, the Computed Average Energy Requirementshall be determined as specified in the purchaser's power sales contract.That specification is provided in:a. Sections 16, 17(c), and 17(f), as adjusted by other sections of thecontract, for actual computed requirements purchasers;b. Sections 16, 17(a), and 17(f), as adjusted by other sections of thecontract, for planned computed requirements purchasers; andc. Sections 16 and 17(b), as adjusted by other sections of the contract,for contracted computed requirements purchasers.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Operating Demand</ITAG>The Operating Demand is that demand which is established by each DSI inaccordance with section 5(b) of the DSI's power sales contract. Unlessthe DSI has requested, and BPA has granted, an Auxiliary Demand, the OperatingDemand establishes a limit with respect to:a. The demand which the purchaser may impose on BPA; andb. The total amount of energy during a billing month which the DSI is entitledto purchase from BPA.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Curtailed Demand</ITAG>A Curtailed Demand is the number of kilowatts of industrial power (IndustrialFirm Power or Special Industrial Power) during the billing month whichresults from the DSI's request for such power in amounts less than theOperating Demand therefor. Each purchaser of industrial power may curtailits demand according to the terms of its power sales contract (which permitsup to three levels of Curtailed Demand each month).<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Restricted Demand</ITAG>Restricted Demand is the number of kilowatts of industrial power (eitherIndustrial Firm Power or Special Industrial Power) that results when BPAhas restricted delivery of such power for one clock-hour or more. BPA shallmake such restrictions according to the terms of the DSI's power salescontract. In a given billing month, there are as many possible levels ofRestricted Demand for a DSI as there are number of restrictions.<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Auxiliary Demand</ITAG>Auxiliary Demand is the number of kilowatts of Auxiliary Power that a DSIrequests and that BPA agrees to make available to serve a portion of theDSI's load during the period specified in the DSI's request. The DSI mayrequest up to three levels of Auxiliary Demand during a billing month.If BPA agrees to a request for Auxiliary Power but later becomes unableto supply such demand, the Restricted Demand for Auxiliary Power is deemedto be the Auxiliary Demand for such period of restriction. Auxiliary Powermay be curtailed by the DSI according to the provisions of section 9(a)of the DSI's power sales contract.BPA shall make Auxiliary Power available to Industrial Firm Power purchasersunder the Industrial Firm Power Rate Schedule at the Standard IndustrialRate. Auxiliary Power sales to DSIs electing to purchase under the VariableIndustrial Power Rate Schedule (VI-87) shall be made at the rate determinedpursuant to section III of the VI-87 rate schedule. Auxiliary Power salesto DSIs purchasing under the Special Industrial Rate will be made onlyat the Standard Special Industrial Power Rate.<ITAG tagnum="81">10. BPA Operating Level</ITAG>The BPA Operating Level is, for the purpose of these rate schedules andGRSPs, an hourly amount of industrial power (Industrial Firm Power or SpecialIndustrial Power) for a DSI that is equal to the lowest of the followingdemands during that hour:a. Operating Demand plus Auxiliary Demand, if any;b. Curtailed Demand; orc. Restricted Demand.The weighted average BPA Operating Level for each DSI can be determinedby summing the hourly BPA Operating Levels and dividing by the number ofhours in the billing month.Each DSI must request service from BPA for each billing month in accordancewith the terms of the power sales contract. The requested level of servicewill be the BPA Operating Level, provided BPA does not need to restrictthe DSI and provided BPA agrees to supply any requested Auxiliary Demand.Each requested level of service may include a designation for both thePeak Period and the Offpeak Period. A DSI may request and BPA may agreeto a level of service for the Offpeak Periods other than that in the PeakPeriod. If a DSI does not separately designate a requested level of servicefor the Peak and Offpeak Periods, the BPA Operating Level is the basisfor determining if a DSI has incurred an unauthorized increase. Any DSI whose Measured Demand, before adjustment for power factor, duringany 1 hour exceeds the BPA Operating Level for that hour shall be subjectto unauthorized increase charges for each kilowatthour of unauthorizedincrease associated with each overrun. Only the BPA Operating Level applicable during the Peak Period will beused in determining the Billing Demand for power purchased under the IndustrialFirm Power rate schedule, the Variable Industrial Power rate schedule,and the Standard Rate under the Special Industrial rate schedule. Duringthe Peak Period the BPA Operating Level may be no greater than the OperatingDemand for the billing month unless the customer has requested, and BPAhas agreed to supply, the Auxiliary Demand. B. Billing Factors for Energy <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Measured Energy </ITAG>Measured Energy shall be that portion of the metered or scheduled energythat is purchased from BPA under the applicable rate schedule. For thosecontracts to which BPA is a party and that provide for delivery of morethan one class of electric power to the purchaser at any point of delivery,the portion of each 60-minute clock-hour integrated demand assigned toany class of power shall be determined pursuant to the power sales contract.The sum of the portions of the demands so assigned shall constitute theMeasured Energy for each such class of power. The Measured Energy shall be determined from the metered energy or thescheduled energy, as hereinafter defined. a. <T3>Metered Energy. </T3>The metered energy for a purchaser shall be thenumber of kilowatthours that are recorded on the appropriate metering equipment,adjusted as specified in the power sales contract, and delivered to a purchaser:(1) At all points of delivery for which metered energy is the basis fordetermination of the Measured Energy, and (2) During any billing period. The metered energy shall be determined from measurements made either inthe manner specified in the power sales contract or as provided in sectionVI.A herein. b. <T3>Scheduled Energy.</T3> The scheduled energy in kilowatthours shallbe the sum of the hourly demands at which electric energy is scheduledfor delivery to a purchaser: (1) For each system for which scheduled energy is the basis for determinationof the Measured Energy, and (2) During any billing period. Scheduled amounts are deemed delivered for the purpose of determining billingenergy. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Computed Energy Maximum </ITAG>The Computed Energy Maximum equals the product of the number of hours inthe billing month and the Computed Average Energy Requirement. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Contract Energy </ITAG>The Contract Energy shall be the maximum number of kilowatthours that thepurchaser agrees to purchase and BPA agrees to make available, subjectto any limitations included in the power sales contract. C. Billing Adjustments <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Power Factor Adjustment </ITAG>The formula for determining average power factor is as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L1(0,0,0),tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,s10,23,55,r10</C>  <H1> </H1><H1>Average power factor=</H1><H1>Kilowatthours</H1><H2/><T4>t</T4> (Kilowatthours)\2\+(Reactive kilovoltamperehours)\2\<H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG> The data used in the above formula shall be obtained from meters that areratcheted to prevent reverse registration. These data then shall be adjustedfor losses, if applicable, before determination of the average power factor.When deliveries to a purchaser at any point of delivery either: a. Include more than one class of power, or b. Are provided under more than one rate schedule and it is impracticableto meter the kilowatthours and reactive kilovoltamperehours for each classor rate schedule separately, the average power factor of the total deliveriesfor the month will be used, where applicable, as the power factor for allpower delivered to such point of delivery. To maintain acceptable operating conditions on the Federal system, BPAmay, unless specifically otherwise agreed, restrict deliveries of powerto a purchaser with a low power factor. Such restriction may be made toa point of delivery or to a purchaser's system at any time that the averageleading power factor or average lagging power factor for all classes ofpower delivered to such point or to such system is below 75 percent. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Outage Credit </ITAG>To the extent that BPA is unable to provide full service to a purchaserduring the billing month as a result of interruptions in service due toreasons cited in the General Contract Provisions, BPA shall adjust thecharges for those hours for billing demand for such purchaser to reflectBPA's inability to provide full service, provided such adjustment is mandatedby the purchaser's power sales contract. The adjustment is provided ona point of delivery basis. To compute the adjustment for noncoincidentallybilled systems, BPA shall determine the monthly demand charge(s) for thepoint(s) of delivery where the outage(s) occurred, multiply by the numberof hours of outage, and divide by the total number of hours in the billingmonth. For coincidentally billed points of delivery, the adjustment shallapply only to those points of delivery at which BPA was unable to providefull service. For partial outages (such as an outage on one feeder in asubstation with several feeders), BPA shall determine an equivalent interruptionin order to arrive at the number of hours to be used in the calculationof the credit. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Low Density Discount (LDD) </ITAG>a. <T3>Basic LDD Principles.</T3> A predetermined discount shall be appliedeach billing month to the charges for all power purchased under the PriorityFirm Power rate schedule by eligible purchasers as defined in section b,below. The discount shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall becomeeffective with the first billing period in the calendar year. Retroactivebilling for the LDD may be required if the data are not available by theJanuary billing date. The level of the discount shall be determined fromthe following ratios: (1) The purchaser's total electric energy requirements during the previouscalendar year (the purchaser's firm sales, nonfirm sales to firm retailloads, sales for resale, and associated losses, but excluding nonfirm salesto nonfirm retail loads, such as boiler loads served under BPA's alternatefuel policy) divided by the value of the purchaser's depreciated electricplant (excluding generation plant) at the end of such year, and (2) The average number of consumers (annual and seasonal consumers withresidential, industrial, commercial, and irrigation accounts, but excludingseparately billed services for water heating, electric space heating, andsecurity lights) during the previous calendar year divided by the numberof pole miles of distribution line at the end of such year. Distributionlines are defined as those that deliver electric energy from a substationor metering point, at a voltage of 34.5 kV or less, to the point of attachmentto the consumer's wiring and include primary, secondary, and service facilities.These calculations shall be based on data provided in the purchaser's annualfinancial and operating report. In calculating these ratios, BPA shalluse data pertaining to the purchaser's entire electric utility system withinthe region. Results of the calculations shall not be rounded. Customers who have not provided BPA with all four requisite pieces of annualdata (see a.(1) and a.(2) above) by June 30 of each year shall be declaredineligible for the LDD effective with the June billing period for thatyear. BPA shall extend a customer's eligibility from the previous yearthrough the June billing period of the following year and shall make anynecessary retroactive adjustments once the new data have been processed.If no data have been received by December 31 for the previous calendaryear, BPA shall assume that the utility did not qualify for an LDD forthat year. Low Density Discounts issued from January 1 to June 30 shallbe assumed to have been in error, and the utility shall be billed for anysuch discounts issued. Revisions to the data used to calculate the amount of the LDD may be madeby the purchaser for a period of up to 2 years from the first day to whichthe data apply. However, such revisions shall not apply to periods whenthe customer was ineligible for a discount due to late data submission.b. <T3>Eligibility Criteria. </T3>To qualify for a discount, the purchasermust meet all six of the following eligibility criteria: (1) The purchaser must serve as an electric utility offering power forresale; (2) The purchaser must agree to pass the benefits of the discount throughto the purchaser's consumers within the region served by BPA; (3) The purchaser's average retail rate for the reporting year must exceedthe average Priority Firm Power rate in effect for the qualifying periodby 10 percent. For CY 1989, the average Priority Firm Power rate shallbe the average of the PF-87 Preference rate for 9 months and the PF-89Preference rate for 3 months. For CY 1990, the average Priority Firm Powerrate shall be the PF-89 Preference rate; (4) The purchaser's kilowatthour-to investment ratio (Ratio 3.a.(1)) mustbe less than 100; (5) The purchaser's consumers-per-mile ratio (Ratio 3.a.(2)) must be lessthan 12; and (6) The purchaser must qualify for a discount based on the criteria insection c, below. c. <T3>Discounts. </T3>The purchaser shall be awarded the greatest discountfor which that purchaser qualifies. The discounts and the qualifying criteriafor those discounts are listed below. (1) Three percent, for any purchaser for whom: (a) The kilowatthour-to-investment ratio is equal to or greater than 25but less than 35; or (b) The consumers-per-mile ratio is equal to or greater than 5 but lessthan 7. (2) Five percent, for any purchaser for whom: (a) The kilowatthour-to-investment ratio is equal to or greater than 15but less than 25; or (b) The consumers-per-mile ratio is equal to or greater than 3 but lessthan 5. (3) Seven percent, for any purchaser for whom: (a) The kilowatthour-to-investment ratio is less than 15; or (b) The consumers-per-mile ratio is less than 3. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Irrigation Discount </ITAG>a. <T3>Basic Irrigation Discount Principles. </T3>A discount of 4.6 millsper kilowatthour shall be applied to the charges for qualifying irrigationenergy purchased under the Priority Firm Power and New Resource Firm Powerrate schedules, during the billing months of April through October. Thisdiscount shall be applied subsequent to calculation of the Low DensityDiscount, if applicable. Any energy on which the irrigation discount isclaimed shall be metered separately by the Purchaser, and used exclusivelyfor agricultural irrigation or drainage pumping. b. <T3>Qualifying Energy Purchases. </T3>The qualifying irrigation energyshall be determined as follows: (1) All irrigation energy must be used exclusively for the purpose of irrigationand drainage pumping on agricultural land and be measured at the end-useirrigation customer's meter. The discount shall apply to the measured energysales at the end-use. (2) Energy subject to the discount must be purchased during the billingmonths of April through October. (3) Purchasers of exchange energy under the Residential Purchase and SaleAgreement (RPSA) are eligible for the irrigation discount for the portionof their irrigation sales qualifying for the exchange under the RPSA contracts.(4) General requirements customers are eligible for an irrigation discountfor a portion of their irrigation sales equal to the share of their totalsales served by BPA firm purchases (i.e., total irrigation and drainagepumping sales multiplied by BPA billing energy for Priority Firm or NewResources firm purchases divided by the total firm utility system requirementsfor the billing month). c. <T3>Initial Reporting Requirements. </T3>Requests for the Irrigation Discountmust include the following information: (1) To receive an irrigation discount, a purchaser must file a requestfor the discount with its local BPA Area or District office by April 1each year. (2) In the request, the purchaser must certify that the irrigation energyis sold exclusively for use in irrigation and drainage pumping on agriculturalland and that the discount is passed, in its entirety, to the irrigationconsumer, regardless of whether the utility has raised its rates. BPA retainsthe right to verify, in a manner satisfactory to the Administrator, thatthe discounted energy is used for the sole benefit of the purchaser's irrigationload. d. <T3>Annual Reporting Requirements. </T3>Purchasers shall submit an annualirrigation report to their local BPA Area or District office in order toreceive the irrigation discount. Purchasers are required to report informationrelated to monthly irrigation energy sales. If a utility does not readits irrigation meters monthly, the utility must estimate its monthly irrigationsales. These estimates shall be reviewed by BPA area and/or district offices.Purchasers must read their meters within 3 working days of the beginningand ending of the irrigation discount period (April-October). In orderto qualify for the discount, the purchaser must submit all data to BPAby December 31 of the calendar year in which the sales occurred. Irrigationreports to BPA shall include the following monthly information for thereporting period: (1) Utility name and period for which the report is being made; (2) Total irrigation sales and total qualifying irrigation energy sales(in kilowatthours) by month; (3) Total qualifying irrigation sales (in kilowatthours) by month under400 horsepower, for exchanging utilities; (4) Total utility firm system requirements for other than full requirementcustomers by month (in kilowatthours); (5) Total energy purchased from BPA under the Priority Firm or New Resourcerate by month in kilowatthours; and (6) The Purchaser shall list each irrigation and drainage account numberin its annual report and whether each irrigation consumer is billed monthly,bimonthly, or seasonally. If the Purchaser is an exchanging utility, thePurchaser shall also identify the size (in horsepower) of the connectedload for each active account. A utility may submit monthly reports, ifit chooses. In that case, the active list of accounts should be includedin the last monthly report submitted. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Cost Recovery Adjustment Clause </ITAG>a. <T3>Applicable Rate Schedules. </T3>The Cost Recovery Adjustment Clause(CRAC) applies to the 1989 Priority Firm Power (Exchange and Preference),Industrial Firm Power, Variable Industrial Power, Firm Capacity, and NewResource Firm Power rate schedules. A percentage adjustment, labeled asCRAC%, is calculated for specific periods and applied to these rates byvarious formulas. b. <T3>Evaluation and Adjustment Periods. </T3>There are two evaluation andadjustment periods for the Cost Recovery Adjustment Clause.(1) <T3>Period 1. </T3>Period 1 is comprised of an evaluation period coveringFY 1989 (October 1, 1988 through September 30, 1989) and an adjustmentperiod of January 1, 1990 through September 30, 1990.After September 30, 1989, BPA shall evaluate its preliminary, unauditedfinancial position by measuring its FY 1989 net revenues (BPA's total FY1989 revenues less FY 1989 expenses.)Any resulting rate adjustment shall be at the Administrator's discretion,shall be upward only, and shall not be greater than 10.0 percent.If the net revenues are less than zero for the evaluation period (FY 1989)as specified herein, BPA may adjust the applicable rates (PF-89, IP-89,VI-87, CF-89, and NR-89) upward over an adjustment period beginning January1, 1990, and ending September 30, 1990.(2) <T3>Period 2. </T3>Period 2 is comprised of an evaluation period coveringFY 1990 and an adjustment period of January 1, 1991, through September30, 1991.Any resulting rate adjustment shall be at the Administrator's discretion,shall be upward only, and shall not be greater than 10.0 percent.After September 30, 1990, BPA shall evaluate its preliminary, unauditedfinancial position by measuring its FY 1990 net revenues (BPA's total FY1990 revenues less FY 1990 expenses). The amount of any CRAC adjustmentresulting from Period 1 evaluation shall be subtracted from FY 1990 revenuesto obtain the adjusted FY 1990 net revenues. If adjusted FY 1990 net revenuesare less than zero for Period 2, BPA may adjust the applicable rates (PF-89,IP-89, VI-87, CF-89, and NR-89) upward over an adjustment period beginningJanuary 1, 1991, and ending September 30, 1991.c. <T3>Formulas for the Cost Recovery Adjustment Clause. </T3>(1) <T3>Adjustment Calculation. </T3>BPA shall determine the net revenue foreach evaluation period using the following formulas:(a) <T3>Period 1:</T3><ITAG tagnum="16">NR1=revenues^expenses</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">revenues=total operating revenues (in millions of dollars) from theFCRPS Statements of Revenues and Expenses;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">expenses=sum of total operating expenses, net interest expense, andany litigation settlement expenses or other extraordinary expenses shownseparately on the FCRPS Statements of Revenues and Expenses (in millionsof dollars);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">NR1=FY 1989 net revenues (in millions of dollars).</ITAG>If NR1 is zero or greater, then there will be no rate adjustment; and<ITAG tagnum="16">CR1=zero</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">If NR1 is less than zero:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">CR1=absolute value of NR1, and is the cost recovery for Period 1.</ITAG>The following formulas apply for the calculation of the percent that theCost Recovery Adjustment Clause could increase the applicable rates duringJanuary 1, 1990, through September 30, 1990:(i) If CR1 is greater than $29.6 million, then the CRAC% equals the lesserof:<ITAG tagnum="16">(A) (CR1+11.571)/13.721; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">(B) 10.0 percent.</ITAG>(ii) If CR1 is less than or equal to $29.6 million, then, for PF, CF, andNR rate schedules (IP and VI are not adjusted):<ITAG tagnum="16">CRAC%=CR1/9.859</ITAG>(b)<T3> Period 2:</T3><ITAG tagnum="16">NR2=(revenues-ACR1)^expenses</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">NR2=Adjusted FY 1990 net revenues (in millions of dollars); and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">ACR1=The lesser of CR1 or $125.6 million, or zero if rates were notadjusted as a result of a CRAC adjustment in Period 1.</ITAG>If NR2 is zero or greater, then there will be no rate adjustment.If NR2 is less than zero, then:<ITAG tagnum="16">CR2=absolute value of NR2, and is the cost recovery for Period 2.</ITAG>The following formulas apply for the calculation of the percent that theCost Recovery Adjustment Clause could increase the applicable rates duringJanuary 1, 1991, through September 30, 1991:(i) If CR2 is greater than $32.8 million, then the CRAC% equals the lesserof:<ITAG tagnum="16">(A) (CR2+11.833)/14.876; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">(B) 10.0 percent.</ITAG>(ii) If CR2 is less than or equal to $32.8 million, then, for PF, CF, andNR rate schedules (IP and VI are not adjusted):<ITAG tagnum="16">CRAC%=CR2/10.936</ITAG>    d. <T3>Application to Irrigation Discount.</T3> In addition to the directapplication of the cost recovery adjustment percentage (CRAC%) to the irrigationdiscount, an additional adjustment shall be made so that irrigation loadsare not disproportionately affected by a 9-month adjustment period as comparedto a 12-month adjustment period.

The PF, CF, and NR rateschedules are subject to the Conservation Surcharge. If only a portionof the customer's service area is subject to the surcharge, then the amountof the surcharge shall equal 10 percent of the total charge for all powerpurchases multiplied by: (a) the portion of the customer's total retailload that is subject to the surcharge, divided by (b) the customer's totalretail load. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Billing-Related Definitions </ITAG>1. <T3>Peak Period. </T3>The Peak Period includes the hours from 7 a.m. through10 p.m. on any day Monday through Saturday inclusive. There are no exceptionsto this definition; that is, it does not matter whether the day is a normalworking day or a holiday. Any charges based on Peak Period hours shallbe computed starting with the 8 a.m. meter reading since this reading appliesto the 7 o'clock hour (7 a.m. to 8 a.m.). The 10 p.m. meter reading (forthe 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. period) is the last meter reading of the day applicableto the Peak Period. 2. <T3>Offpeak Period. </T3>The Offpeak Period includes all hours which donot occur during the Peak Period. Thus, the Offpeak Period consists ofthe hours from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m., Monday through Saturday and all hourson Sunday.

B. Definitions Relating to Nonfirm Energy  Decremental Cost Unless otherwise specified in a contractual arrangement, decremental costas applied to Nonfirm Energy transactions shall be defined as: 1. All identifiable costs (expressed in mills per kilowatthour) associatedwith the use of a displaceable thermal resource or end-user load with alternatefuel source to serve a purchaser's load that the purchaser is able to avoidby purchasing power from BPA, rather than generating the power itself orusing an alternate fuel source; or 2. All identifiable costs (expressed in mills per kilowatthour) to servethe load of a displaceable purchase of energy that the purchaser is ableto avoid by choosing not to make the alternate energy purchase. All identifiable costs as used in the above definition may be reduced toreflect costs of purchasing BPA energy such as transmission costs, losses,or loopflow constraints that are agreed to by BPA and the purchaser.

For points of delivery that do not have RMS metering, demand shall bemeasured from 0000 hours on the first complete (24 hour) day of the availablemetering data through 2400 hours on the last complete day of the availablemetering data. Billing demand will be determined from the period of availablemetering data that most closely matches the official billing period ofthe customer. E. Determination of Measured Energy 1. For points of delivery with fully operational metering under RMS, energyshall be measured from 0000 hours on the first day of the billing periodthrough 2400 hours on the last day of the billing period. 2. For points of delivery that do not have RMS metering, measured energyshall be the quantity of usage recorded on the meter between meter readings.F. Billing Month Meters normally will be read and bills computed at intervals of 1 month.A month is defined as the interval between meter-reading dates which normallywill be approximately 30 days. If service is for less than or more thanthe normal billing month, the monthly charges stated in the applicablerate schedule shall be adjusted appropriately. The calendar month in which the purchaser's meter is scheduled to be readdetermines the billing month. (Thus, a bill associated with a meter scheduledto be read on April 10 would be an April bill.) The charges for the winterand summer periods identified in the rate schedules apply to the purchaser'sbilling months. G. Payment of Bills Bills for power shall be rendered monthly by BPA. Failure to receive abill shall not release the purchaser from liability for payment. Billsfor amounts due BPA of $50,000 or more must be paid by direct wire transfer;customers who expect that their average monthly bill will not exceed $50,000and who expect special difficulties in meeting this requirement may request,and BPA may approve, an exemption from this requirement. Bills for amountsdue BPA under $50,000 may be paid by direct wire transfer or mailed tothe Bonneville Power Administration, P.0. Box 6040, Portland, Oregon 97228-6040,or to another location as directed by BPA. The procedures to be followedin making direct wire transfers will be provided by the Office of FinancialManagement and updated as necessary. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Computation of Bills </ITAG>Demand and energy billings for power purchased under each rate scheduleshall be rounded to whole dollar amounts, by eliminating any amount whichis less than 50 cents and increasing any amount from 50 cents through 99cents to the next higher dollar. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Estimated Bills </ITAG>At its option, BPA may elect to render an estimated bill for that monthto be followed at a subsequent billing date by a final bill. Such estimatedbill shall have the validity of and be subject to the same payment provisionsas a final bill. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Due Date </ITAG>Bills shall be due by close of business on the 20th day after the dateof the bill (due date). This requirement holds also for revised bills (seesection 6 below). Should the 20th day be a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday(as celebrated by the purchaser), the due date shall be the next followingbusiness day.    <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Late Payment </ITAG>Bills not paid in full on or before close of business on the due date shallbe subject to a penalty charge of $25. In addition, an interest chargeof one-twentieth percent (0.05 percent) shall be applied each day to thesum of the unpaid amount and the penalty charge. This interest charge shallbe assessed on a daily basis until such time as the unpaid amount and penaltycharge are paid in full. Remittances received by mail will be accepted without assessment of thecharges referred to in the preceding paragraph provided the postmark indicatesthe payment was mailed on or before the due date. Whenever a power billor a portion thereof remains unpaid subsequent to the due date and aftergiving 30 days' advance notice in writing, BPA may cancel the contractfor service to the purchaser. However. such cancellation shall not affectthe purchaser's liability for any charges accrued prior thereto under suchcontract. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Disputed Billings </ITAG>In the event of a disputed billing, full payment shall be rendered to BPAand the disputed amount noted. Disputed amounts are subject to the latepayment provisions specified above. BPA shall separately account for thedisputed amount. If it is determined that the purchaser is entitled tothe disputed amount, BPA shall refund the disputed amount with interest.as determined by BPA's Office of Financial Management. BPA retains the right to verify, in a manner satisfactory to the Administrator,all data submitted to BPA for use in the calculation of BPA's rates andcorresponding rate adjustments. BPA also retains the right to deny eligibilityfor any BPA rate or corresponding rate adjustment until all submitted datahave been accepted by BPA as complete. accurate, and appropriate for therate or adjustment under consideration. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Revised Bills  </ITAG>As necessary, BPA may render a revised bill. A revised bill shall replaceall previous bills issued by BPA that pertain to a specified customer fora specified billing period if the amount of the revised bill is less thanthe amount of the original bill. If the amount of the revision causes anadditional amount to be due BPA beyond the original bill, a revised billwill be issued for the difference. The date of the revised bill shall be determined as follows: a. If the amount of the revised bill is equal to or less than the amountof the bill which it is replacing, the revised bill shall have the samedate as the replaced bill. b. If the amount of the revised bill is greater than the amount of thebill which it is replacing, the additional amount will be billed on a separatebill, and the date of the revised bill shall be its date of issue.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section VII. Variable Industrial Rate Parameters and Adjustments</ITAG>A. Monthly Average Aluminum Price Determination <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Calculation of the Monthly Billing Aluminum Price  </ITAG>The monthly billing aluminum price shall be determined by BPA for eachbilling month. For purposes of this rate schedule, the monthly billingaluminum price shall be based on the average price of aluminum in U.S.markets during the third calendar month prior to the billing month. Theaverage price of aluminum in U.S. markets shall be defined as the averageU.S. Transaction Price reported for the month by <T3>Metals Week, </T3>in cents per pound, rounded to the nearest tenthof a cent. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Notification of the Monthly Average Aluminum Price </ITAG>BPA shall provide, 45 days prior to the billing month, written notificationto purchasers under this rate schedule of the monthly billing aluminumprice to be used for billing purposes. Upon written request supportingdocumentation shall be provided. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Changes in Aluminum Price Indicators </ITAG>In the event that BPA determines that factors outside its control renderthe monthly average U.S. Transaction Price unusable as an approximationof U.S. market prices, BPA may develop and substitute another indicatorfor prices in U.S. markets. BPA shall notify interested parties of itsintent to do so at least 120 days prior to the billing month in which thechange would become effective. In this notification. BPA shall explainthe reason for the substitution and specify the replacement indicator itintends to use. BPA also shall describe the methodology to determine themonthly billing aluminum price to be used for billing purposes under thisrate schedule and shall provide the necessary data to be used in the calculation.Interested persons will have until close of business 3 weeks from the dateof the notification to provide comments. Consideration of comments andmore current information may cause the final methodology and the substitutealuminum price index to differ from those proposed. BPA shall notify allaffected parties, and those parties that submitted comments, of its finaldetermination 90 days prior to the billing month the new indicator shallbe effective. B. Annual Adjustments to the Lower and Upper Pivot Aluminum Prices On July 1, 1987, and every July 1 thereafter, the Lower and Upper PivotAluminum Prices, as stated in section III.B of the rate schedule. shallbe subject to change for billing purposes as herein described. The term``annual adjustment date'' shall refer to July 1 of each year.    <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Implementation Procedures </ITAG>Beginning in 1987 and every year thereafter, prior to April 1 of that year,BPA shall provide the purchasers under this rate schedule preliminary writtenestimates of proposed adjustments to the Lower and Upper Pivot AluminumPrices. By the last working day of the month of April, BPA shall notifyinterested parties in writing of BPA's revised determinations concerningchanges to the Lower and Upper Pivot Aluminum Prices. BPA shall describehow the adjustments were determined and provide the data used in the calculations.In addition to written notification, BPA may, but is not obligated to,hold a public comment forum to clarify its determinations and solicit comments.Interested persons may submit comments on the determinations to BPA andother parties. Comments will be accepted until close of business on thelast working Friday in May. Consideration of comments and more currentinformation may result in the final adjustment differing from the proposedadjustment. By June 30 of each year, BPA shall notify all VI purchasers,those parties that submitted comments, and parties that requested notification,of the final determination. <ITAG tagnum="81">2.
