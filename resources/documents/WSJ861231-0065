Generale d'Electricite of France and ITT Corp., concluding their agreement to combine telecommunications operations, said ITT's interest in a British affiliate won't be included in the venture as originally anticipated.    As a result, CGE will pay ITT about $250 million less than envisioned, ITT officials said. When the transaction was proposed six months ago, the venture was to include 20% of STC PLC, a 24%-owned ITT affiliate that makes telephone cable and other equipment. But CGE and its partners decided against buying the STC stake because it would only increase the amount of money to be paid to ITT without giving the new venture a strategic advantage in selling equipment in Britain, industry analysts said.    As previously reported, the ITT and CGE telecommunications joint venture agreement that was signed yesterday in Brussels, Belgium, will give Paris-based CGE and its partners 63% of the venture and ITT 37%. New York-based ITT will get $1.25 billion for its telecommunications subsidiaries that will be part of the venture and will transfer $800 million of debt of those subsidiaries' to the venture.    The agreement forms a new industrial giant that will be the world's second-biggest telecommunications group behind American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. Temporarily called Teleglobal Communications N.V., the new venture will be based in Brussels but incorporated in the Netherlands. It will have assets of about $9 billion, annual sales of roughly $12 billion, 164,000 employees in 75 countries and a market share of 12% world-wide and 45% in Europe for public switching equipment.    ITT's $1.25 billion includes $902 million in exchange for transferring management and majority ownership of its world-wide telecommunications units to the new company and repayment of about $350 million in debt owed to ITT by the subsidiaries.    ITT said that while it will report a &quot;substantial&quot; pre-tax gain on the acquisition, the gain will be more than offset by a provision for U.S. taxes now due on earnings of the European subsidiaries becoming part of the venture.    Because some of those tax payments will be deferred, however, ITT will get the use of between 50% and 75% of the $1.25 billion, according to Merlin Alper, vice president and assistant controller. ITT has said it could use money from its CGE transaction for stock buybacks or debt reduction, but Mr. Alper said a decision hasn't yet been made.    While ITT's gain hasn't been determined yet, it will be calculated by subtracting from the proceeds the sum of the $1.7 billion book value of the ITT units put into the venture and the expenses of the transaction, Mr. Alper said. Proceeds would be equal to about $2.5 billion, including the value of ITT's stake in the new venture.    That would make the pre-tax gain before expenses about $800 million. The transaction will immediately reduce ITT's debt as a percentage of equity to 29% as of year-end 1986, down from 36% at Sept 30, the company said. ITT valued its 37% stake at $1.6 billion.    CGE will own 55.6% of the new venture, paying ITT $577 million. Societe Generale de Belgique, the big Belgian holding company, will own a 5.7% stake, and Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned French bank, will hold the remaining 1.7%.    As previously reported, Cia. Telefonica Nacional de Espana S.A., the Spanish state-owned telephone company, won't join the venture because of disagreements with CGE over management control. But the company, known as Telefonica, hasn't ruled out participating later.    CGE officials said the decision to exclude STC wasn't made to save money, but because ITT's stake was too small to exercise control over the company. It would only have made CGE a minority shareholder in a competitor.    Also included in the new venture are Alcatel S.A., CGE's telecommunications unit; Cables de Lyon, its cable unit; all of ITT's telecommunications activities and manufacturing plants, with the exception of its stake in STC; ITT's two fiber-optic plants in the U.S.; the cable operations of ITT's European subsidiaries and its European consumer electronics businesses. </TEXT></DOC>
