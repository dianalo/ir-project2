The investment bank's $4 billion program remains the same in the U.S. market, where it provides commercial paper in physical form.    Commercial paper consists of short-term IOUs -- usually of 90-day or less maturity -- issued by roughly 1,600 of the biggest and best-known corporations and some foreign government institutions. Current commercial paper programs in place in the U.S. are believed to be between $325 billion and $350 billion.    In making its commercial paper program available world-wide, Salomon is teaming up with Citibank and Cedel, a Luxembourg-based international securities clearing organization. Together, they say, they have developed a mechanism that gives U.S. issuers of commercial paper better access to European and Asian investors without having to undertake a separate Euro-commercial paper program.    The three parties also contended that their paperless book-entry system offers issuers reduced costs, greater speed and a more secure delivery and payment mechanism. At the same time, investors would get improved liquidity. The entire issuing, delivery, clearance and settlement process would be handled by a Citibank computer system and Cedel's clearing systems.    &quot;There's absolutely no way you can take possession of the security without paying for it,&quot; said Daniel F. Benton, a vice president at Salomon Brothers Inc., the chief subsidiary of Salomon Inc. The current system of moving physical securities, he said, functions on &quot;a promise to pay and maintains needless paperwork.&quot; That, he contended, &quot;is silly in the 1980s.&quot;    Salomon Brothers intends to try to use the new book-entry system to expand its market share as a dealer in commercial paper. Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. are the two biggest dealers, followed by a group consisting of Salomon Brothers, First Boston Corp. and Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. Mr. Benton said he expected clients to begin using the system in six to eight weeks.    Commercial paper generally allows issuers to borrow below bank interest rates, because the instruments' maturities can be tailored to meet a specific lender's needs.    Corporate treasurers say the fledgling Euro-commercial paper market, which consists of such securities issued outside the U.S., is between $15 billion and $25 billion.    Currently, U.S. Treasury securities, those of several government-sponsored agencies such as the Federal National Mortgage Association, and some big corporations -- including General Motors Acceptance Corp. and Ford Motor Credit Co.are sold in book-entry form in the U.S. Each of these large issuers has set up its own system and is a direct issuer.    A major hurdle for the Salomon-Citibank-Cedel system is that it isn't usable domestically, where, according to Mr. Benton, more than 90% of all U.S.-issued commercial paper is sold. The domestic system isn't likely to change soon, he said, blaming buyers' &quot;inertia to new structures.&quot;    Investment bankers said it is difficult to get many different issuers, investors, dealers and custodians to agree on a single book-entry method. In addition, one banker said that a book-entry system raised legal questions about liability in the event of an issuer's default. Others said that commercial banks that act as custodians didn't want to surrender the lucrative fees associated with handling physical securities.    &quot;If whatever Salomon Brothers is doing eventually helps standardize book-entry in commercial paper in the U.S., we're all for it,&quot; said Jerome Van Orman, director of U.S. borrowings for GMAC in Detroit. &quot;We'll work with any leading party to help standardize this in the U.S. We view it as part of our own interest.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
