Authorities said a train carrying the 633 refugees, somechanting ``Deutschland!'' pulled out of a train station in Warsaw,Poland, late Thursday on a journey through Poland and East Germanyto West Germany.   Those aboard had crowded West Germany's embassy in Warsaw inhopes of joining more than 46,000 East Germans who have made theirway through Hungary, Czechoslovakia or Poland since mid-September.   West German radio and television reported early today that moreEast Germans had entered the embassy in Warsaw. ``The number at theembassy is not yet known,'' the radio reported.   The ZDF television said the would-be emigres ``heard the trainhad left, and are also hoping to emigrate.''   The journey comes as East Germany, deeply embarrassed by theexodus, begins two days of celebrations marking the communistcountry's 40th anniversary.   Among those flying in to attend the festivities is SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who is expected to ask EastGermany's aging hard-line leaders how they plan to handle thewestward flight that is draining much of the East Germany's workforce.   Poland contributed two extra cars to a six-car East German trainsent to carry the refugees to West Germany, which grants themautomatic citizenship and helps them start new lives.   The train left Gdansk Station in northern Warsaw Thursdayevening, and West German railway officials said the train hadcrossed into East Germany by early today.   Freedom trains that left Czechoslovakia brought 7,600 EastGermans to the West Thursday after a trip plagued by delays anddisrupted by a riot in Dresden, East Germany, witnesses said.   West German officials have not said whether they overestimatedhow many East Germans would join the exodus from Czechoslovakia'scapital of Prague, having initially cited a possible figure of10,000 to 11,000.   In Prague, 200 East Germans left the West German Embassy lateThursday and headed home with promises from their government oflegal emigration within months. Sources said about 10 East Germansstill were inside the mission.   Czechoslovak police used riot police to seal off the embassyfrom more East Germans. East Germany restricted travel toCzechoslovakia earlier this week.   There was sympathy among Czechoslovaks for the East Germanrefugees. The hard-line Prague government has also refuseddemocratic reform.   ``Of course they are running away,'' a 40-year-old Czechoslovaksaid on condition of anonymity. ``They want freedom.   ``I am sure this will have some impact on our country ... but itwill take some time because our leadership is very conservative.''   East Germans began making their way west through Hungary in Maywhen that communist country removed obstacles from its border withAustria. Since Hungary officially opened its borders Sept. 10,about 32,000 East Germans have used that route to West Germany.   About 7,000 more East Germans arrived in West Germany lastweekend from Warsaw and Prague, where they had taken refuge in WestGerman embassies.   Police in Dresden reportedly used clubs and water cannons todrive crowds back from the main railroad station during the exodusfrom Czechoslovakia.   ``It was a horrible scene,'' said a woman in Dresden who askednot to be identified because she feared reprisals. ``People weretrying desperately to get to the platforms and the tracks, but thepolice forced them back.''   Refugees said the first train stopped outside Dresden for hours.At least three others were diverted around the city. Protestershurled stones at police and at the Dresden station, smashingwindows, witnesses reported. They said thousands took part.   Masses of regular police, secret police and workers' groupsorganized by the Communist Party dispersed the crowds and sealedoff the stations.   East Germany insisted the trains pass through its territory,rather than crossing into West Germany from Czechoslovakia, so itcould formally declare the refugees expelled.</TEXT></DOC>
