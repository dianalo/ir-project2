Lee, the Taiwanese businessman charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission with insider trading, could be extradited from Hong Kong to the U.S. if he is indicted on criminal charges.    Under the terms of a 1972 treaty with Britain, which covers Hong Kong, Mr. Lee could be returned to the U.S. for prosecution if he is found to have profited illegally, according to international law experts, State Department officials and others. Mr. Lee is believed to be residing in Hong Kong.    However, the U.S. has no extradition treaty with Taiwan, where Mr. Lee also has a residence. If he travels to Taiwan, he may be protected from U.S. criminal charges there, State Department lawyers said.    According to people familiar with the case, the Securities and Exchange Commission's findings that Mr. Lee reaped more than $19 million of illegal insider-trading profits on information allegedly provided by a Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. analyst, Steven Wang Jr., have been referred to the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan for criminal investigation. If the SEC's findings are confirmed, it is likely that Mr. Lee will face criminal charges relating to insider trading or mail fraud.    The SEC has already frozen &quot;a substantial amount&quot; of Mr. Lee's assets in the U.S., according to an individual familiar with the SEC's actions. But the agency isn't likely to move to freeze Mr. Lee's assets in Hong Kong or Taiwan. According to international law experts, the U.S. doesn't have arrangements with those countries to freeze assets.    Michael F. Perlis, Mr. Lee's U.S. attorney, has said that &quot;We intend to resist&quot; the SEC complaint, adding that Mr. Lee intends to stay out of the U.S. If Mr. Lee refuses to cooperate with the SEC, the agency could enter a default judgment against him.    But Harvey Pitt, a Washington, D.C., securities lawyer, said that a default judgment &quot;is only helpful if you have assets in the U.S.&quot; It would be difficult, he said, to obtain many foreign assets under such a judgment. </TEXT></DOC>
