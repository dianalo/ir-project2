Thousands of victims of Hurricane Hugo, Northern California'searthquake and tornadoes in the South found special reasons to givethanks as they joined with neighbors and family.   At Thanksgiving, ``some people who are expecting sadness findjoy and hope because people care,'' said Monroe Free, director ofthe Union Rescue Mission in Knoxville, Tenn.   ``This will be a very special Thanksgiving,'' said PresidentBush in a Thanksgiving address that noted the changes in EasternEurope.   ``But before our families sit down tomorrow, we will give thanksfor yet another reason: Around the world tonight, new pilgrims areon a voyage to freedom and for many,'' said Bush, who is spendingthe holiday with his family at Camp David, Md.   Thanksgiving is also the sign that Christmas _ and the frenziedshopping season, heralded by elaborate parades _ is ahead.   High wind at Macy's 63rd annual Thanksgiving Day parade in NewYork grounded the larger-than-life Snoopy and Bugs Bunny balloons.The snow was the first to hit the parade since 1938.   ``It's a white Thanksgiving!'' cheered Nora Deledansky, 12, oneof an estimated 1.8 million shivering spectators. About 55 millionpeople also saw the parade on television.   Despite record snowfall in Philadelphia, the 70th annualThanksgiving Day parade came off, but not without a hitch. The55-foot Humpty Dumpty balloon had a great fall when it waspunctured by a light standard.   For five people, Thanksgiving was quite out of this world:Discovery's astronauts were celebrating in space withthermo-stabilized turkey, freeze-dried vegetables and cranberrysauce.   In a fall of tornadoes, a hurricane and an earthquake, itperhaps was fitting that the first snowstorm hit the Northeast onThanksgiving.   Up to 8 inches of snow fell on Cape Cod in Massachusetts, and 5inches was reported at Snowshoe ski resort near Marlinton, W.Va.Baltimore residents woke up to their first white Thanksgiving since1971. ``All sorts of records, tons of records,'' said HarryWoodworth, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Newark,N.J., where almost 6 inches fell.   Around Charleston, S.C., where demolished homes bear witness tothe hurricane that killed 29 people in September, volunteers servedan estimated 5,000 turkey dinners at 13 sites for hurricane victimsand the elderly.   ``I think the world had gotten to the point where people were somuch for themselves,'' said Carole Allen of McClellanville, whosehouse was badly damaged and workplace destroyed. ``I think thishappened to awaken people and make them realize there's more tolife than a bank account and a beautiful home.''   In San Francisco, thousands of survivors of the earthquake thatkilled more than 60 in October celebrated Thanskgiving with freefeasts and prayers of gratitude in virtually every neighborhood,from the seedy Tenderloin to the upscale Marina.   In Huntsville, Ala., Wayne Stinson and Wanda Clark were marriedas scheduled _ but in the hospital where Stinson is recovering frominjuries suffered in a deadly tornado Nov. 15. ``I can't think of abetter day to get married. We decided that this did nothing to ourrelationship but strengthen it,'' Clark said.   In Virginia _ where the first Thanksgiving reputedly was held in1619, more than a year before the Pilgrims had theirs inMassachusetts _ Gov. Gerald L. Baliles invited the chiefs of thestate's eight Indian tribes to their first Thanksgiving dinner atthe governor's mansion. ``This is the one that we, the PowhatanIndians, have been looking for since 1607,'' said Chief WebsterCustalow of the Mattaponi tribe.   Thousands upon thousands of people who make their homes onAmerica's streets were invited to meals at churches and shelters.Dinner for 8,000 was served at the 22nd annual Topeka CommunityDinner in Kansas.   ``We just keep serving until there's nobody left to serve,''said Grant Cushinberry.   In Indianapolis, volunteers worked to feed about 25,000 peoplein three counties. Twenty-nine New York City shelters served 15,000turkey dinners. And the Salvation Army cooked for more than 13,000people in the city.   A group called God's Love We Deliver took gourmet meals tohomebound AIDS patients and their guests. ``We want to make sureour clients have a wonderful meal and aren't spending it alone,''said Daniel Stricker, God's Love's chief operating officer.   Holiday celebrations had a different flavor in Los Angeles,where The Laugh Factory served up holiday dinners to unemployedcomedians and a group of vegetarians hosted a live turkey whilesupping on bread and grain-stuffed peppers.   Some people recalled life in other places.   After just six weeks in the United States, the Mai family fromVietnam planned a traditional American celebration in Lincoln, Neb.``I thank God for bringing my family here to freedom, happiness andgood health,'' said Suong Thi Mai, 23. ``Thanksgiving is a goodchance for refugee people to look back at all the good things theyhave received.''   Lions Club members from Indiana, Michigan and Minnesota leftThursday in a caravan, headed to Guatemala with ambulances, medicalsupplies, clothing, toys and used eyeglasses for people in thatCentral American country.</TEXT></DOC>
