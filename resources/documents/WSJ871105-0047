It was far easier to recognize a friend or an enemy, to tell a good proposition when you saw one, than to know whether or not the 'law' was on your side.&quot;    -- Daniel Boorstin in   &quot;The Americans: The Democratic Experience&quot;    Some remaining capricious spirit of the Wild West surely came into play in the Texas Supreme Court's decision, announced Monday, to remain mute on Pennzoil v. Texaco. The justices ignored constitutional law, common law and federal law issues in refusing to hear Texaco's appeal of a $10.3 billion judgment against it in a Texas lower court.    In so doing, the justices further exposed their state to distressing charges of rigged courts. A Journal page-one article yesterday detailed how Texas judges were already under scrutiny. Indeed, the Texas chief justice is retiring to fight plaintiff lawyers who use campaign contributions to influence the law toward ever broader liability standards.    This case was tainted from the start. Pennzoil's lawyers played on regional prejudices in urging a jury to teach those folks from New York a lesson. Such courtroom antics are supposed to be leavened by impartial application of the law by the judge. Instead, the judges became the issue.    Just after Judge Anthony Farris was assigned the case, Pennzoil lawyer Joe Jamail became the major contributor to the judge's re-election campaign. Judge Farris became ill late in the trial and was replaced by Solomon Casseb Jr., a retired divorce judge. Judge Casseb not only embraced Pennzoil's proposed jury instructions but also later admitted in a speech that he didn't read the precedents Texaco cited and that he likely erred about New York law.    Judge Casseb confused the informal, preliminary agreement Pennzoil reached with Getty's board with a legally binding contract. Pennzoil had agreed &quot;in principle&quot; to buy part of Getty; then Texaco bid more. He should have told the jury to decide if Pennzoil had a contract. He also should have asked the jury that if so, whether Texaco meant to interfere with this contract. Attorneys general from 20 states, including New York, have filed briefs saying the judge failed to follow relevant law.    Texaco's lawyers now will petition the U.S. Supreme Court. They will argue that the due-process clause of the 14th Amendment ensures impartial judges, yet the Texas Appeals Court mysteriously held that &quot;mere bias or prejudice&quot; doesn't disqualify a judge. The full faith and credit clause means states must conscientiously apply each other's laws, meaning that Texas should have correctly applied New York law, since that is the law that covered Pennzoil's alleged deal with Getty. The commerce clause prohibits local favoritism.    There is also a securities law issue, which had led the Securities and Exchange Commission to file an amicus brief on behalf of Texaco's appeal. Rule 10b-13 says once a tender offer begins, the bidder must treat all shareholders alike. But Pennzoil offered to pay the Getty Museum more for its shares, sooner than it would pay other shareholders, even if the merger failed. The SEC said that this &quot;plainly violated Rule 10b-13.&quot; Even if there was a contract, it was void. Texaco can't be guilty of interfering with a nonexistent contract.    The Constitution gives the federal government the power -- and the duty -- to keep states from undermining the rule of law. The SEC and the solicitor general should urge the Supreme Court to hear the appeal. The Texas Supreme Court had its chance and muffed it. </TEXT></DOC>
