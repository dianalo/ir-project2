The diversification of sources feeding this integratedpipeline grid enhances the security of West European natural gas supplies.The principles underlying the transmission, storage and distributionof natural gas remain valid in a potential future hydrogen economy becausethe physics of the two fuel gases are very similar. The energy-carryingcapacity of a pipeline is nearly the same for hydrogen as it is for naturalgas. Compressors are also needed for hydrogen transportation, but thehorse power installed must be four times larger than for a natural gassystem, and fuel gas consumption will also be higher. Storage installationswill hold both natural gas and hydrogen, but the capacity of a hydrogenstorage facility must be three times greater than the capacity neededto store an energyequivalent quantity of natural gas. The transitionfrom the methane economy to a hydrogen-based system could be gradual,blending increasing shares of hydrogen with conventional natural gassupplies over a period of several decades.</TEXT></DOC>
