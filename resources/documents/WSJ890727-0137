The utility concern said net income rose to $384.4 million, or $1.22 a share, from $318.3 million, or $1.03 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $3.56 billion from $3.46 billion, while kilowatt-hour sales grew 3.7%.    Continued growth in energy sales and utilization during the period led to &quot;stronger financial results,&quot; said Edward L. Addison, president. He added that &quot;the outcome of a rate case now in progress in Georgia will have a significant impact on our earnings for the full year.&quot;    Public hearings on a $374 million rate-increase request from Southern's Georgia Power unit began last week. The increase, which would be phased in over two years, is designed to help it recover costs at the Unit 2 Vogtle Nuclear Power Plant.    The Georgia Public Service Commission has already disallowed certain costs related to Unit 1 Vogtle, a decision that Southern has appealed in court. Unless the commission's decision is overturned, the company will have to take a $205 million charge, Mr. Addison said.    For the most recent 12-month period, Southern said net increased 27% to $912.4 million, or $2.90 a share, from $721.1 million, or $2.36 a share. Revenue rose to $7.32 billion from $7.26 billion.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Southern's shares closed at $27.50, up 75 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
