Copeland, who made a fortune selling peppery fried chicken, thinks he has the recipe to rejuvenate Church's Fried Chicken Inc.    To prove his seriousness, yesterday he launched an offer of $8 a share, or about $283.4 million, for Church's, a San Antonio, Texas-based chain whose earnings and store sales have plunged in recent years.    Mr. Copeland would like to convert some of Church's 1,100 company-owned restaurants into his Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken and Biscuits outlets, close a few duds and heat up the business at the remainder of the stores. In doing so, he would cut back on Church's heavy discounting efforts and freshen up its menu.    &quot;We're going to wind up with two fried chicken operations. We want to build on what they have,&quot; he says.    Church's, however, isn't so sure it wants to join Mr. Copeland in the kitchen. The company said its board will consider the offer by Nov. 7 and make a recommendation to shareholders then. It also said it hired Morgan Lewis Githens andamp; Ahn as its investment banker and Davis Polk andamp; Wardell as its lawyers.    The stock market apparently expects a higher bid. The stock rose to $8.25, up $1, on volume of 2.5 million shares in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.    Mr. Copeland says he wants to negotiate a transaction with Church's but said he launched a tender offer because the company has rejected at least a couple of suitors who made offers to its board.    Last year, a former Church's chief executive officer dropped a $12.25-a-share, or $460 million, buy-out offer for Church's after the company declared that it wasn't for sale. The executive, Richard F. Sherman, had disagreed with founder J. David Bamberger's strategy of simplifying the menu, lowering prices and running more company-owned stores.    In the meantime, the company has run afoul of even more difficulties, including tougher competition in the fast-food business, a big jump in chicken prices and the continuing economic slump in the Southwest, where more than half of Church's stores are located.    Church's per-store sales have dropped to $361,000 in 1987 from $433,500 in 1985. Its earnings were down almost 73% for the 36 weeks ended Sept. 4, to $2.1 million, or six cents a share, on revenue of $290.7 million. And it recently omitted its quarterly dividend to spend the savings on improving its restaurants.    To turn the company around, Mr. Bamberger this summer brought in some veteran restaurant executives as top managers.    Popeyes, in contrast, has suffered few such problems, adding about 80 restaurants a year and racking up per-store sales of more than $650,000. Its owner, A. Copeland Enterprises Inc. of New Orleans, owns about 100 of the 700 Popeyes outlets -- the rest are franchisees -- and has annual revenue of about $100 million. Because it is closely held, however, Mr. Copeland wouldn't disclose profits.    Mr. Copeland said he decided a couple of years ago to build his company through acquisitions and began bringing in management talent, hiring executives from Steak andamp; Ale, Brown Shoe Co. and even Church's chief financial officer. His company said Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce has agreed to provide as much as $144.4 million in senior debt financing for the tender offer and as much as $261.9 million for the merger and working capital.    Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner andamp; Smith Inc. also said it is confident it can raise $200 million in senior subordinated debt.    Copeland already owns 1.2 million, or about 3.2%, of Church's approximately 36 million shares.    Even if he doesn't succeed in devouring Church's, the flamboyant Mr. Copeland most certainly will gain a higher profile -- although he already has one in New Orleans. An avid powerboat racer, Mr. Copeland is known there for lighting up his home with thousands and thousands of Christmas lights, until a neighbor forced him to stop in a court battle. Now he lights up his New Orleans office building instead. </TEXT></DOC>
