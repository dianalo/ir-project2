That proposedrevision to Part 336 would, among other things, eliminate one semiannualfiling of the Confidential Report of Indebtedness required to be filedby certain FDIC employees and decentralize the collection and retentionof the records in the system to designated divisional, regional, and consolidatedoffices of the FDIC. The latter change necessitates a companion changein the system of records. Another change is being brought about by theexistence of an Office of Personnel Management government-wide system,found at 49 FR 36949, 36962 (Sept. 20, 1984), which covers Financial DisclosureReports (Standard Form 278). Those reports are currently listed as a coveredrecord category in the existing FDIC system. The FDIC therefore intendsto delete this category from its system and follow the government-widesystem with respect to such reports. The system will be amended to includewithin the categories of covered records the Employee Certification andAcknowledgement of FDIC Standards of Conduct Regulation, that is designedto identify compliance with Part 336, which requires that all employeesreceive a copy of the standards of conduct within 30 days of commencementof employment. It will also be amended to include within the categoriesof covered records the Statement of Credit Card Obligation in Insured StateNonmember Bank and Acknowledgement of Conditions for Retention_Notice ofDisqualification, that is designed for the purpose of providing a systemfor examiners and other covered employees of the Division of Bank Supervisionto report compliance with credit card restrictions and self-disqualificationfrom the examination and supervision processes.Finally, the proposed changes reflect a general clarification and updateof the language in the system. Accordingly, the Board of Directors of theFDIC proposes to revise the Employee Financial Disclosure Statements systemto read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="66">FDIC 30-64-0006</ITAG>SYSTEM NAME:Employee Financial Disclosure Statements System.SYSTEM LOCATION:Confidential Statements of Employment and Financial Interests, Reportsof Interest in Bank Securities and Interest in FDIC Decision, ConfidentialReports of Employment Upon Resignation, Employee Certification and Acknowledgementof FDIC Standards of Conduct Regulation, Statement of Credit Card Obligationin Insured State Nonmember Bank and Acknowledgement of Conditions for Retention_Noticeof Disqualification, and related records are located in designated divisional,regional, or consolidated offices to which individuals covered by the systemare assigned.
