It was India's second launch failure in 15 months.   The rocket's first-stage motor apparently malfuctioned shortlyafter the rocket, the Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV),blasted off at 2:28 p.m. from Sriharikota Island, 1,100 milessoutheast of New Delhi, according to a scientist at the launch site.   The scientist, who spoke on condition of anomymity, said contactwith the rocket was lost 1 minute and 15 seconds after takeoff. TheUnited News of India news agency said the rocket crashed into theIndian Ocean 4 minutes and 10 seconds after the launch.   The chairman of the Indian Space Research Organization in NewDelhi, U.R. Rao, was quoted as saying the exact cause of the launchfailure had not been determined.   It was the second failed Indian space mission since anotherrocket from the same ASLV series plunged into the Bay of Bengal inMarch 1987, when its first-stage motor failed to ignite minutesafter launching.   The scientist at the launch site said the first-stage motor inWednesday's launch ignited, but ``something went wrong after that.''   The rocket carried a 330-pound satellite designed to takethree-dimensional photographs of Earth and conduct experiments onthe origins of gamma rays. The satellite was to enter an orbit 240miles above Earth, scientists said.   The failure of the mission comes amid reports that India coulddevelop the ASLV rocket as a launch vehicle for nuclear weapons.   According to Anthony H. Cordesman, a U.S. military analyst, therocket, with the addition of a heat shield and a guidance system,could deploy intermediate-range ballistic missiles or IRBM.   ``The Indians themselves have estimated that they could have anoperational, nuclear-armed IRBM by 1989,'' Cordesman said in apublished report.   India exploded an atomic device in 1974, but the government saysits nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.   India last successfully launched a satellite on April 17, 1983.   Since 1980, it has launched two other satellites, while threeother missions failed, including the first ASLV launch.   Six Indian-made satellites have been sent into orbit by spaceagencies in the Soviet Union, United States and Europe.   On Tuesday, the Soviet Union successfully launched the second oftwo space probes to explore Mars and help prepare for a mannedflight to the red planet.</TEXT></DOC>
