Kidder, 80%-owned by General Electric Co., said it is still committed to the municipal securities business, which has struggled over the past six months because of high volatility and low volume. Kidder's municipal staff will have about 180 people after the layoffs.    &quot;We're not getting out&quot; of municipals, said Max C. Chapman Jr., president of Kidder Peabody andamp; Co., Kidder's securities brokerage unit. &quot;What we've got to do is get ourselves prepared to go through a difficult period here.&quot;    The municipal business has been hurt partly by last year's tax-law changes that make these bonds less attractive to investors. A couple of years ago, Kidder was one of the Street's leaders in municipal securities. The tax-law change especially hurt Kidder's portion of the business -- pollution control and tax-exempt housing bonds -- and helped drop Kidder from the top ranks, Kidder sources said.    Kidder said it will attempt to find other jobs within the firm for some of the people affected by the cut. But Kidder sources said that only about 30 to 50 people have a chance of being kept on.    Kidder's move comes in the wake of Salomon Brothers Inc.'s decision to shut down its municipal department and lay off 200 professionals there. Salomon also is laying off 600 other staffers in Wall Street's largest recent restructuring.    Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., which with 350 staffers has one of the largest municipal departments on the Street, said yesterday it will seek to increase its market share. William W. Moore, head of municipals, said the firm believes municipal securities is one of its &quot;core businesses,&quot; and that the firm &quot;intends to sustain and attempt to increase&quot; its position in the market. Over the past year, Merrill has trimmed about 40 people from its municipal unit, mostly through transfers and attrition. </TEXT></DOC>
