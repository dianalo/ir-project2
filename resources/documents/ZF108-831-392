And what is it about PostScript printers that makes themso desirable and so expensive?andM;Michael LubinandM;Orlando, FloridaandM;PostScript is a programming language for printers.andP;  It's not ageneral-purpose programming language like C, BASIC, or Pascal, but a pagedescription language (or PDL) that simplifies the task of transferringgraphics to the printed page.andM;PostScript traces its origins to the late 1970s at the legendary computergraphics finn Evans andamp; Sutherland.andP;  It moved from there to Xerox's Palo AltoResearch Center in 1978, and underwent its final incarnation in 1982 whenJohn Warnock and Chuck Geschke banded together to form Adobe Systems.andP;  Theresult was PostScript as we know it today--an interpreted language that makesit easy to put just about anything you want to on a printed page, be it text,vector graphics, or bitmapped images.andM;The allure of PostScript is that it makes generating complex images onprinters a snap.andP;  It allows arbitrary shapes to be constructed from graphicsprimitives such as lines and curves.andP;  Once a shape, or path as it is known inPostScript, is built, it can be outlined, filled, or used to clip othergraphics.andP;  In addition, PostScript makes it extremely easy to apply fonts toa page.andP;  Characters can be scaled, rotated, run along a path, or even used asclipping paths themselves.andM;As an example, think of how difficult it is for a program (or a printerdriver) to draw a diagonal line from one comer of an 8 1/2- by 11-inch pageto another on a dumb laser printer (dumb is a term often applied to printersthat do not incorporate PostScript or a similar page description languagesuch as the HP LaserJet).andP;  The program first has to raster-convert the lineto a virtual page stored in memory and then traverse the page from top tobottom, sending commands to the printer to fill in the line dot by dot.andP;  WithPostScript, however, all it takes is this simple series of commands:andM;newpathandM;0 0 movetoandM;612 792 linetoandM;strokeandM;showpageandM;The newpath command tells PostScript to start a new path.andP;  0 0 moveto movesthe pen to the lower-left comer of the page, and 612 792 lineto draws a lineto the upper-right comer of the page (PostScript measures distances inpoints, where 1 point equals 1/72 of an inch).andP;  Finally, the stroke operatortells PostScript to apply ink to the line using the current color (or grayscale) and pen width, and the show-page command prints the page and ejects itfrom the printer.andM;Get the picture? PostScript shifts the burden of rasterizing graphics from aprogram or printer driver to itself.andP;  Many printers now have PostScriptinterpreters built in, so that all you have to do is send the PostScriptcommands out to your printer, and the printer takes care of the rest.andM;PostScript also takes the pain out of dealing with text.andP;  Most non-PostScriptprinters use bitmapped fonts exclusively, where characters are stored asarrays of dots.andP;  But bitmapped fonts aren't easily scaled; that's why you endup downloading three different fonts to a LaserJet when you want to print 8-,10-, and 12-point Times Roman on the same page.andM;PostScript stores characters as collections of lines and curves, so fonts areinfinitely scalable.andP;  The code to print PostScript across a page in 72-point(1 inch) Times Roman characters may look like:andM;/Times-Roman findfontandM;72 scalefontandM;setfontandM;100 100 movetoandM;(PostScript) showandM;showpageandM;This program looks up the definition for Times Roman characters in a fontdictionary (the table where PostScript stores font definitions) usingfindfont, scales it to 72 points with scale font, and makes it the currentfont with setfont.andP;  The show operator prints the string in parentheses andshowpage ejects the page.andM;It's that easy.andP;  It would have been equally easy to choose a Helvetica fontor to have scaled it to 6 points instead.andP;  Most flavors of PostScript comewith several different fonts, including Times Roman, Helvetica, and Courier,each in normal upright, bold, italic, and bold italic fonts.andM;The simple code fragments shown above only begin to tap into PostScript'spower.andP;  Consider the short program shown in Figure 1 [omitted].andP;  The drawtextprocedure, defined at the top of the listing, prints &quot;Boxes by PostScript&quot; onthe bottom half of the page.andP;  To center it uses PostScript's stringwidth todetermine the width of the string and the built-in sub (subtract) and div(divide) operators to subtract the string width from the width of the pageand divide the difference by 2.andM;The drawbox procedure draws a box 100 points on a side at the current penposition using the indicated color.andP;  Colors are set with the setrgbcoloroperator by specifying values from 0 to 1 for red, green, and blue.andP;  Thisexample also shows how PostScript programs pass parameters to procedures onthe stack.andP;  The three RGB values passed to drawbox are placed on the stackwhen they're encountered following the translate operator and then poppedback off when setrgbcolor is encountered in drawbox.andP;  So the instruction 0.81 drawbox draws a blue-green box at the current pen position.andM;The main body of the program, which starts near the bottom of the programtext, uses the procedures defined earlier.andP;  Its output is shown in Figure 2[omitted].andP;  (The output shown in Figures 2 and 4 [omitted] has been reducedfor reasons of space.) Note that the boxes overlay one another.andP;  Because ofthis, we say that PostScript uses an opaque imaging model.andP;  It works as ifyou were applying layers to a page, with each layer masking out ones appliedearlier.andM;The final program example, shown in Figure 3 [omitted], uses PostScript'sability to use character outlines as clipping paths to produce an unusual PCMagazine logo.andP;  First, it calls up a 72-point italic bold Times Roman font,sets the red, green, and blue components of the current color to 0, 0.5, and1, respectively, and writes &quot;PC Magazine&quot; in a rich blue.andP;  Then it changesthe current color to pure red, redefines the outline of the string &quot;PCMagazine&quot; as the current clip path, and draws a series of radial lines at Idegree increments emanating from the lower-left comer of the string.andP;  Theresult is shown in Figure 4 [omitted].andP;  Notice the moire effect in the P andthe C, and the fine red lines streaking through Magazine.andM;There are several PostScript printers available for the PC, including theApple LaserWriter, which can be used with IBM hardware, provided you can livewith the slow serial data link.andP;  If you already own a laser printer,particularly an HP LaserJet, your options are many.andP;  Several companies offerPostScript boards that endow LaserJets with PostScript after the fact.andP;  Afull review of hardware options appeared in the April 11, 1989, issue of PCMagazine (&quot;Add-in Boards for the HP LaserJet&quot;).andM;You can also buy PostScript cartridges that plug into ports reserved for fontcartridges.andP;  Or you can emulate PostScript in software, using products likeGoScript or GoScript Plus from LaserGo, UltraScript PC or UltraScript PC Plusfrom QMS, or Freedom of Press from Custom Applications.andP;  Software emulationtends to be slow, but these products can cost as little as $195--a smallprice to pay compared with the cost of a PostScript printer.andM;The bigger question is whether or not you want PostScript.andP;  It's a wonderfultool to have, especially if your work centers around desktop publishing.andP;  ButPostScript is expensive, largely because Adobe licenses it to other vendorsfor hefty fees that are passed on to you the consumer.andM;Microsoft recently announced its plans for a competing language calledTrueImage, which incorporates a PostScript-like font technology calledTrueType.andP;  In addition, Microsoft has made it clear that PresentationManager's Graphics Programming Interface, which bears many conceptualsimilarities to PostScript, will support non-PostScript laser printers.andP;  Addto this that many dumb laser printers, including HP's new LaserJet III, nowcome with PostScript-like scalable fonts built in, and it's anything butclear that investing in PostScript now will pay dividends later.andM;If you want to learn more about PostScript, there are several books on thesubject.andP;  Among them: PostScript Language Reference Manual and the PostScriptLanguage Tutorial and Cookbook, both written by Adobe Systems and publishedby Addison-Wesley.andP;  These are the definitive volumes on the language andoffer a wealth of splendid programming examples illustrating exactly howPostScript works.andM;NEW ADDRESSandM;There was a small but fatal error in the DEBUG listing for NOPAUSE.COM,published in the April 10, 1990, Tutor column.andP;  To account for an addressingdiscrepancy, add another 0 to the line DB 0,0,0,0.andP;  Sorry about theconfusion.andM;ASK THE TUTORandM;The Tutor explains techniques for using your hardware and software moreproductively.andP;  Questions about DOS and systems in general are answered.andP;  Tohave your questions answered, write to Tutor, PC Magazine, One Park Avenue,New York, NY 10016, or upload them to PC MagNet (see the &quot;By Modem&quot; sidebarin the Utilities column).andP;  We're sorry, but we're unable to answer questionsindividually.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
