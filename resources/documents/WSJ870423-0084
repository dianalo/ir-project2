Dingell Says His Takeover MeasureWill Curb Greenmail, Golden Parachutes---By Monica Langley and Bruce IngersollStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/23/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chairman John Dingell of the House Energy and Commerce Committee said his comprehensive takeover legislation would restrict or even outlaw so-called greenmail payments to corporate raiders and golden parachute contracts for managers of target companies.    At a breakfast meeting with Wall Street Journal editors and reporters, Rep. Dingell said his objective is to ensure &quot;a level playing field&quot; in takeover contests without inhibiting bona fide tender offers.    The takeover legislation, which he said could be introduced within the next few days, would include a provision mandating a one-share, one-vote standard for most securities. The Michigan Democrat also indicated his package would curb other defensive tactics, including so-called poison pills that make takeovers prohibitively expensive.    &quot;I'm neither for nor against takeovers,&quot; Rep. Dingell said. &quot;But I do think the system very much favors takeover specialists.&quot;    The legislation, among other things, would lengthen the current 20-business-day period for tender offers, giving shareholders and management more time to weigh bids. It also would shorten the time investors are given to disclose stock holdings of 5% or more in a company. Currently, a raider has 10 days to disclose such a stake, which allows him to quietly amass stock in a company.    Separately, Rep. Dingell said he will modify a controversial investment-disclosure provision in the Energy and Commerce trade bill before it is considered by the full House next week as part of the sweeping trade package. The provision, offered by Rep. John Bryant (D., Texas), would require disclosure of foreign investment in the U.S, and opponents contend it would discourage foreigners from buying stocks here.    &quot;We will change the whole structure of the Bryant amendment,&quot; Rep. Dingell said. Late yesterday, the Energy and Commerce Committee submitted a modified Bryant amendment that addresses the major concerns of businesses, which have been organizing to kill the amendment when the trade bill is taken up on the House floor next week.    Rep. Dingell said he is &quot;leaning very strongly&quot; toward a &quot;flat-out ban&quot; on greenmail, a practice by which a company buys back stock at a premium above the market price from an unwanted suitor. He also favors outlawing golden parachutes, which are employment contracts that specify lucrative compensation for managers if they are ousted in a takeover.    He said the ban could cover existing golden parachute contracts as well. &quot;If we do the drafting properly, we can do it to companies that have them in their charters or bylaws,&quot; he said.    The powerful chairman has long been concerned about the proliferation of dual classes of stock with unequal voting rights. Many companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and other markets have issued more than one class of stock as a defense against hostile takeovers. But critics maintain that the tactic disenfranchises shareholders and entrenches management.    The package Rep. Dingell is preparing would mandate one-share, one-vote. But yesterday he conceded that his proposal would have to be &quot;tempered by reality&quot; to accommodate companies that already have two classes of stock and to allow certain types of financing.    Rep. Dingell said he plans to introduce separate legislation later this spring to curb insider trading and other &quot;misbehavior&quot; by securities firms and their employees. His aides, he added, must redraft the bill to counter new schemes by &quot;innovative entrepreneurs&quot; on Wall Street, he added.    Securities firms' so-called Chinese walls separating investment banking departments from arbitrage operations aren't stopping the flow of confidential takeover information, Rep. Dingell said. But he said he hasn't yet decided on &quot;the medicine&quot; to cure the problem.    On trade legislation, Rep. Dingell said the Bryant amendment on disclosure &quot;is now being perfected.&quot; The most significant change in the Energy and Commerce Committee's modified Bryant amendment submitted to the Rules Committee last night concerns the amount of stock holdings that triggers disclosure.    In the new version, foreign investors would be required to report holdings of large blocks of corporate securities exceeding $50 million, rather than $10 million as originally proposed. Also, the beneficial owner, not the securities firm making the purchase of the stock, would be required to report the holdings.    With these changes, the Securities Industry Association dropped its strong opposition to the Bryant amendment. In a letter to Rep. Dingell, the association's president, Edward O'Brien, wrote, &quot;A compromise has been reached, alleviating our concerns about market impact and thereby permitting us to drop our objections&quot; to the provision.    Another change addresses the concerns of multinational corporations with U.S. units that feared the reporting requirements would give competitors details about their acquisitions and operations. In the new version, foreigners' purchases or holdings through a U.S. subsidiary whose securities are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission won't have to provide additional information. Instead, a U.S. unit could merely submit to the Commerce Department a copy of its recent SEC filings.    Rep. Dingell cited Royal Dutch/Shell Corp. and its Shell Oil Co. unit as an example of a company that might be excluded from the reporting requirements.    The chairman said his staff is also working to modify another controversial trade provision before next week's floor action. That measure would give the president authority to restrict foreign acquisition of U.S. businesses if such acquisitions would &quot;threaten national security or impair essential commerce.&quot;    The provision is directed at situations similar to the recent proposed merger of Fujitsu Ltd. and Schlumberger Ltd.'s Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. unit, although that merger eventually was called off.    Rep. Dingell recently returned from a congressional trip to Brazil and Argentina to discuss energy and trade issues, with particular focus on patents, trademarks and copyrights. The lawmaker complained that Brazil was using its substantial debt exposure as an excuse for its unfair promotion and subsidy of exports.    Rep. Dingell said he expects limited energy legislation this year. &quot;There will be nothing on oil pricing and no sweeping legislation,&quot; he said. He does expect, however, to repeal most of the Fuel Use Act, which puts restrictions on burning of natural gas in large industrial and utility boilers.    ---       TAKEOVER PROPOSAL    Takeover legislation to be introduced by House Energy and Commerce Chairman John Dingell:    -- Restrict or ban greenmail    -- Restrict or ban golden parachutes    -- Shorten 10-day reporting period to disclose stakes of 5% or more    -- Lengthen tender offer period from the current 20 business days    -- Mandate one-share, one-vote standard for certain securities    -- Restrict poison pills</TEXT></DOC>
