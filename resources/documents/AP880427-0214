WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   George Bush, the apparent Republican presidential nominee, andhis likely Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis set a combative tonefor the campaign Wednesday, with Dukakis saying Bush has ``someexplaining to do'' on the Iran-Contra affair.   ``Let him fire away,'' Bush challenged.   Both said they looked forward to debates.   The other Democrat still in the race, Jesse Jackson, gamelylooked ahead to the next round of primaries in Ohio and Indiana.Despite Dukakis' huge victory in Pennsylvania on Tuesday andgrowing delegate lead, Jackson said the race wasn't over.   ``I keep struggling against the odds, and I've always struggledagainst the odds and succeeded,'' Jackson said on ABC-TV. ``Thiscampaign will remain alive. It will go right down to the wire inCalifornia and New Jersey on June 7.''   Bush locked up the Republican nomination, passing the required1,139-delegate mark with an easy win in Pennsylvania against afield that had long since withered.   He lunched privately with President Reagan, who indicated thetime was nearing for a formal endorsement of his vice president.   Administration and Republican Party sources, meanwhile, saidReagan planned to strictly limit his role at the RepublicanNational Convention in New Orleans in August to avoid stealingBush's thunder.   Reagan will address the convention on opening night, Monday,Aug. 15, then leave the next day for California, according tosources who spoke only on condition of anonymity.   Both Bush and Dukakis said they would continue theirprimary-campaign efforts. But they were already providing a previewof the fall general election campaign with a long-distance debateon foreign policy and other issues through network TV interviews.   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, opened fire on Bush's rolein the Iran-Contra affair. Bush has suggested he would be a betterchoice as president because he has foreign policy experience thatDukakis lacks..   The governor said, ``All we know is that he sat there and didnothing while we engaged in one of the worst and one of the mostmisguided adventures in the history of American foreign policy,'' areference of the arms-for-hostages dealing directed by White Houseofficials.   ``I can't imagine what they were thinking of when they proceededto do business with a terrorist nation,'' Dukakis added. ``There'ssomebody in the administration, including the vice president, who'sgot some explaining to do.''   Bush said he would ask Dukakis in debate what he would do abouthostages in the Middle East. ``Do you really care when a man likeBuckley is being tortured to death?'' he said he would ask, areference to William Buckley, the CIA official who died after beingtaken hostage in Lebanon.   Bush said he would continue to campaign in the remaining GOPprimaries, despite his clinching of the nomination. ``I don't wantto project an overconfidence or an arrogance that I don't feel,''he said.   He said he ``absolutely, no question about it'' would debate theDemocratic nominee.   Dukakis said, ``I've already agreed to. I don't think he has.... I'd be delighted. I like debating.''   At the same time, a commission formed by the major politicalparties revealed plans for four debates between Sept. 14 and Oct.27.   ``While commitments have not yet been received from all thepresidential candidates to debate under the auspices of ourcommission, we believe the commission ... is best situated toattract the candidates,'' commission co-chairmen Paul G. Kirk andFrank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., Democratic and GOP chiefs respectively,said in a joint statement.   The parties' commission faces competition for control of thisfall's presidential debates from the League of Women Voters, whichhas said it will sponsor three debates of its own.      Jackson, campaigning in Ohio, took on both men on an issue hehas tried to bring to the forefront of the campaign. ``I challengeMike Dukakis and George Bush to define South Africa as a terroriststate that conducts and sponsors terrorism,'' he said.   Talk in both parties was of vice presidential nominees.   Jackson appeared to indicate that conservative Sen. Sam Nunn ofGeorgia, supported for the ticket by many Democratic leaders, mightnot be acceptable. He mentioned no names and framed his comments interms of a running mate for himself, making what seemed to be areference to Nunn's opposition to some civil rights legislation andto the Equal Rights Amendement.   ``Whoever I would have on my ticket would have to have a goodrecord in civil rights, women's rights, social justice, and a realpronounced commitment to peace in this world,'' Jackson said.   Dukakis called it ``too early'' to think about Jackson or anyoneelse for a running mate.   Bush suggested he saw no need to announce a running mate beforethe Republican convention in August. ``I want to watch and see whatthe Democrats do,'' he said.   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, a Dukakis ally, said Nunn or FloridaSen. Bob Graham would be ``great'' on the ticket with Dukakis andalso suggested the name of Arkansas Sen. Dale Bumpers.   Asked about himself as a running mate, Clinton said in aninterview: ``I guess I could help him in the South and sing a goodsong ... but I think my hunch is he'd be better off with a senator,and I think that's what he'll end up doing.''</TEXT></DOC>
