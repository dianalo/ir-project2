Fixed-rated issues were up 3/8 to one point. Volume was thin, with many traders and investors departing early for the Easter holiday weekend.    For the week, some long-dated issues moved in an unusually wide three-point range, at times shifting direction abruptly.    Late Wednesday, for example, many professionals took short positions after prices rose significantly for the second day in a row. But overnight, Japanese traders bid Treasurys and the dollar sharply higher after U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker made a speech defending the dollar's current trading level.    Eurodollar issues jumped nearly a point shortly after yesterday's opening, and some large U.S. houses that had been bearish on the market reportedly took significant losses. One trader at a U.S. investment house remarked, &quot;I don't know what to expect from the markets any more when I arrive in the morning.&quot;    The volatility has given new life to secondary markets that until recently were so sluggish that some traders claimed to be concerned about keeping their jobs. But it has further discouraged investors from buying dollar-denominated issues, and few European traders expect that outlook to change until there is significant policy movement in Washington, Bonn and Tokyo.    &quot;We need some action by the politicians that would show they're doing something concrete to contain the U.S. budget deficit and stimulate economic growth (in West Germany and Japan),&quot; one Eurodollar trader said. &quot;This amount of uncertainty has been very damaging to the markets.&quot;    With U.S. dollar-denominated paper out of favor, borrowers have flocked to other currencies such as the Japanese yen and Australian dollar. Those markets now are suffering from indigestion, traders say.    Yesterday, France's Credit National pushed into the crowded Euroyen market with some difficulty. It issued $106 million of yen-denominated 4 3/8% five-year Eurobonds with both a put and a call option after three years, apparently hoping to differentiate the issue from the large number of other recent five-year Euroyen issues.    At the close, the bonds were even with their fees at 102 1/4 less 1 7/8 bid, despite the fact that they carried a guarantee by the French government, an indication of how selective the markets have become toward new yen paper. Daiwa Europe Ltd. led the issue. </TEXT></DOC>
