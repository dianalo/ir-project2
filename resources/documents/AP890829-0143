In the occupied Gaza Strip, soldiers opened fire during astone-throwing protest killing a 27-year-old student, the army said.In the West Bank, an Arab man suspected of collaborating withIsraeli authorities died of wounds.   The deaths raised to 554 the number of Palestinians killed bysoldiers or Israeli civilians during the uprising and to 100 thetoll of Palestinians slain by fellow Arabs as alleged collaboratorswith Israel. Thirty-eight Israelis also have died.   Also Tuesday, Palestinian uprising leaflets appeared for thefirst time signed by a group calling itself Hezbollah. A governmentsource said officials think the group, like the radical Hezbollah inLebanon, is tied to Iran.   ``Hezbollah and the revolutionary court of justice are going tolay in wait for the Zionists and take revenge for every drop ofblood spilled by their hands,'' said the leaflets.   The government source said many leaflets were distributed in Arabeast Jerusalem and nearby Bethlehem, but Palestinians said only afew have appeared.   Army officials think the group was formed by fundamentalistMoslem Palestinians deported from Israel who made their way toTehran, the source said.   The student killed in Gaza ws identified as Ismail Abu Jayyab. Hehad been jailed four times in the 20-month-old uprising againstIsraeli rule of the occupied territories and was described by Arabreporters as head of Shabiba, the youth movement of Yasser Arafat'sPLO faction Fatah, at Gaza's Islamic University.   An army spokeswoman confirmed soldiers killed Jayyab.   Hospital officials in Ramallah confirmed the death of HusseinHila Brahama, 40, from a skull fracture he sustained last week. Thearmy radio said he was injured when youths in the town of Jerichofirebombed his house.   The army said it was checking the report.   Hospital officials said at least 16 Palestinians were shot andwounded in clashes between soldiers and stone-throwing youthsTuesday in the Gaza Strip.   A 29-year-old teacher also was reported shot in the West Bankwhen soldiers fired at youths who fled into a schoolyard in Nablus.   In Israel, a Jewish youth was stabbed by an 18-year-old Arab inRishon Lezion town near Tel Aviv in what a police spokesman saidappeared a politically motivated act. The victim was slightlyinjured.   Soldiers in the West Bank destroyed two houses in Beit Sahur andAskar villages and sealed five other homes in Askar and Tulkaremtown, army spokesmen said.   Those who lived in the houses are accused of setting fire to anarmy truck, planting a roadside bomb and attacking suspected Arabcollaborators, the army said. One suspect is accused of killing analleged collaborator.   Arab reporters said the houses belonged to families whose sons,aged 15 to 26, are suspected of anti-Israeli violence. They saidmost of the sons are in jail and one was convicted of a firebombingand sentenced to two years imprisonment.   Forty-two people lived in the homes destroyed and sealed, Arabreports said.   The army has demolished more than 200 houses and sealed over 100during the uprising in a collective punshiment the United States andhuman rights groups condemn as a violation of due process since mostsuspects never are tried.   In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, the military issued an orderrequiring special permits for Palestinians to own facsimile machinesfollowing reports that they are used to distribute anti-Israelileaflets.   The Israeli daily Haaretz called on the government to reverse theorder, saying it will be viewed abroad as interference in civilianlife and could harm Israel's image.   ``Outlawing the popular, civilian communications machine willobviously serve as a juicy news item throughout the world,'' Haaretzsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
