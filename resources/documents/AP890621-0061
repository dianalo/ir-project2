Many city parking lots werefull by 6:30 a.m.   Perhaps because of the early start, the Automobile Associationreported, the usual jams on the six-lane M25 motorway that circlesthe city were no worse than usual.   The strike by 75,000 railroad workers was the first national railstrike since 1982.   London had the worst problems because of a strike called Tuesdaynight by 18,500 bus workers to coincide with the strike by thecapital's 10,500 subway workers. The subway strike was the seventhunofficial 24-hour walkout in 11 weeks in London.   London's red double-decker buses and sprawling subway networkcarry more than 3 million passengers daily, while British Railcarries 2 million passengers a day.   ``I saw a car with three bikes on the roof, two in the back, andfive people in the car. I guess they just drive as far as they canand get on their bikes,'' said Patrick Gilligan of London Bicycle Co.   Barclays Bank and the Midland Bank hired buses and organizedpickup points to get their employees to work. Some companies hiredtaxis or booked hotel rooms in central London.   ``The chances of getting a hotel room near the (financialdistrict) now are very, very slim,'' said Stephen Kaye, managingdirector of Room Center UK, a hotel booking agency.   The Royal Mail warned of delays in first- and second-class mail,and all time off for London police was suspended.   The Independent, a London daily, ran a front-page cartoon todayshowing a man holding a briefcase and addressing his tearful family:``I'm just going to work _ I may be gone some time.''   At Gatwick Airport, British Airways chartered 27 buses to helpmake up for the lack of rail service, which normally carries about24,000 airline passengers and employees daily.   No serious traffic congestion was reported Glasgow, Britain'ssecond-largest city, where subway service was not affected.   Police in Liverpool reported no unusual problems.      In Parliament on Tuesday, Prime Minister Margaret Thatchercondemned the strikers for ``a typically selfish policy to putthemselves first ... deliberately causing massive inconvenience tothose who have to work.''   Earlier, the Court of Appeal refused a request by British Rail toblock the planned walkout.   Union members voted 29,675 to 20,704 to strike over BritishRail's proposed 7 percent wage increase and plans to abolishnational wage bargaining.   British Rail, which says the strike will cost it $15.5 million,offered to return to the negotiating table and urged staff to ignorethe strike call.   When subway workers decided Tuesday to go ahead with theirstoppage over pay and work conditions, delegates representing busworkers in the Transport and General Workers Union decided on a24-hour strike to demand a 14 percent pay rise.   They rejected an offer of 8 percent to 9 percent, which LondonBuses said was ``roughly in line with inflation,'' now 8.3 percentannually. The company said a bus driver operating without aconductor earns $340 a week.   The dispute between London Underground and workers on the248-station subway involves trains now operated only by drivers.Drivers want a $99 weekly increase to operate without a guard.   Management is offering $46 plus 14 days extra annual vacation,but is tying the raise to increased productivity.</TEXT></DOC>
