<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-84-0472 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new method for measuring positive and negative charging characteristicsunder electron beam irradiation by using a floating target which is connectedto the gate of a MOSFET is described. The relation between the gate voltageand the drain current, measured in advance before beam irradiation, isused to estimate the induced voltage on the floating target during electronbeam irradiation. The voltage resolution is 5 mV and the measurementaccuracy of the experiment, defined as the reproducibility before andafter beam irradiation, is within 1%.</TEXT></DOC>
